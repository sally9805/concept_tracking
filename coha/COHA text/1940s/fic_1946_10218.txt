I ielenc said this was logical to anyone who had an open mind . Well , now she 's got me into some sort of True Trotskyite picnic . Robert will have fits . " Do you want to go to the washroom ? " asked Grace . " No , thanks , " said Virginia . 1-ler glasses would be in the bag . No thanks , no park restroom for me . I 'll find my glasses and hurry home . She unzipped her bag and began to rummage for the glasses . Someone had been into the bag . She never would have left it in such a mess . She started to say something about this to Grace but then decided not to . Grace would think she suspected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist that everyone who was under the Heel of Capitalistic Oppression was as virtuous as the field lilies . Helene suspected only those who had money and this was very amusing because Helene had quite a lot of money herself , money she was using to bring on the Revolution . But thoughts of Helene and her very special kind of revolution , a strictly invitational affair , were interrupted by the discovery of a large box of powder . Now you do not take a large box of powder to a picnic ; you take a compact . Nor would you take a large comb and a hairbrush . Do n't tell me I 've got into an overnight project . It was so difficult to think . The sun did things to you . She should have known better than to sit in it so long .

She picked up the letters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of darning cotton . Mrs. Robert P. Cunningham . Robert 's writing . Why does he write when he sees me every day of the world ?

" " I ca n't imagine anyone crying over Robert 's letters , " said Virginia stiffly . Somehow she and this Grace had got rather more intimate than she cared to get with someone she had barely met . She thrust the letters deep into the bag . First thing you knew , the girl would be wanting to read them . " Robert writes a very amusing letter . People always say so .

" It wo n't be much longer . " IiWhen the women who had accepted Miss Hart 's invitation to the washroom returned to the large room where Virginia and Grace waited . the re was a good deal of pacing up and down . There was little conversation . The room had the restless , raiho:ul-station feel . " What are we waiting for ? " asked Virginia . " You 'll be transferred before you know it , " said Grace . " I ca n't imagine anything here happening after I know it , " said Virginia . " Are there to be speeches ? " " After all , " said Grace , " you have come a long way in a very short time .

" " You could n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My dear , what I know about the subway .... " Virginia laughed a little to cover up her ignorance of how they had come to this place .

Like Cassie . I tried to impress her . I rewrite and rewrite , I said . It takes me two years to write a novel , I said . And Cassie was sympathetic and she22said it would take her a long time too and that she bet she would have to rewrite . Later on , she said , you may get on to it and make some money on your writing . Now Paula is different . Paula is pleased by my not makingany money . It proves that you are too good , she says . Oh , it is fine to listen to Paula , but I ca n't help wondering if Cassie is nearer the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now to Grace , " but I have never been ambitious . I write for fun . " What are you going to do while I paint ? Robert asked when I said he would paint while we stayed in Paris . Will you paint too ? he asked . No , I said , maybe I 'll write a book . Well , he said , I do n't see why you could n't write a book here . Not quite all of the American writers are doing it in Paris . " I thought Robert was making fun of me and so I had to start to write , to show him . That 's really how I got started . " " All right , " said Grace , " if you do n't want to talk about it . " But I am talking about it . As soon as I started writing I knew that was what I wanted . I had thought I wanted to go to Paris or somewhere for a year but when I started writing I knew that was it . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris I told him I had to have a typewriter . A typewriter , he said . Why ? You never write letters and anyhow you do n't know how to type . Well , I can teach myself , I said . I 'm writing a book , I said , and when you are writing a book you want it to look like a book , not like a letter or a diary . . . . Writing a book ? he said . What about ? It 's not about anything , I said . It 's a novel . . . . We were poor then . I mean , we thought we were . Really we were quite rich , but you never know it until afterwards . I had bought a piano and a vacuum and some other things on the installment plan and that made Robert nervous. 23Robert , I said , you know how my ? Why bother to tell all this to a stranger ? ... a long time ago we went to a party where there was a man who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform . When he got to me I wrote a sentence and my name in my best Palmer Method and he looked at it and said this and that about my character , the sort of thing you could say about anyone , just to look at them . Then he lowered his voice so that no one but me could hear and he said , " I think that someone very close to you has died . " This was about three years after Gordon . " Cheer up , " said Grace . " You 'll be transferred soon . " All this about . transferring . 1 ) o you have to go to that terrible place where people run wildly from one train to another , place where I got stuck once without a nickel ? Left the dress shop with five cents and that seemed all right ; get anywhere in New York for a nickel  --  wonderful transportation  --  Chicago ought to be ashamed . Had to transfer at this rabbit warren and they wanted another nickel from me ... . " I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 'm being transferred . " " I hope you have a nickel . " " What did you say ? " " just a family joke , " said Virginia . " I 'm going next door , " said Grace . " Maybe I 'll leave from there . I thought you had to go to One first but he said there is no rule about it . He explained it to me . " And then Virginia knew where she was . It was some sort of training school for underprivileged and delinquent24girls and she had come to study Conditions . I must be doing a novel with Social Significance . All these new friends of ours always pestering me about why do n't I write something that has Social Significance . I wish Robert had put his foot down . I get enthusiastic about something but it wears off . I wish he would n't take me seriously .

" Supper , ladies ! " " Before long , " said Grace , as she got up from the settee , " I 'll be out shifting for myself  --  wondering where the next meal 's coming from , maybe . " " You must feel free to come to our house any time , " said Virginia . You had to watch out in New York when you said something like that . At home you said to call you up some time when you meant you did n't care if you never saw them again and you were perfectly safe ; they did n't care if they never saw you again and they said oh , you must call me . But here in New York you said to call you up some time and they did ; you said to drop over for dinnersome time and they said they were free tomorrow and what time should they come . But it was a relief to discover that Grace was getting her meals here at the industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would find her a job when she had finished the course . " It would be funny if I looked back and wished for some of the slop they serve here , would n't it ? " said the girl . " The bread is good , " said Virginia . She had been taught to say something kind , if possible . That was Gran . There is always some little good thing , Gran always said . Like all great talkers , Gran wanted to cramp everyone . else's25style . If there is anything I dearly love , she used to say , it is a good listener . . . . I wonder why I mentioned bread . I must have been thinking of that twenty-five-cent kind that infuriates Robert . He thinks nothing of losing a quarter but just let me spend twenty-five cents on a loaf of bread and he says what are we coming to . " Man can not live by bread alone , " said Grace . " And I am not being funny . " " No , " agreed Virginia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steak and let Helene pay for it . Even if this is n't a Trotskyite , pardon me , True " Trotskyite picnic I am certain that Helene is in some way responsible . I had forgotten that Robert is n't coming home to dinner tonight but of course he is n't . I would not be staying here otherwise . His new schedule is so baffling . I better say medium rare because if you say rare you of ten get it raw . Site and Grace went to where the women were lining up . " No pushing , ladies , " said Miss Hart . She spoke as if they and she were separated by a thick wall . " Ladies ! We 'll wait until this pushing stops . " The pushing stopped . Miss I Iart took the key that swung from a long chain at her waist . She unlocked the door . She opened the door and they marched into a hall that was curiously familiar . The floor was brown linoleum and the walls had that same institution combination of paint . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women who marched in front made Virginia think of horses . " Rosa Bonhcur , " she said . " I see what you mean , " said Grace . " No talking , ladies ! " said Miss Hart . She treats the women as if they were criminals . Criminals ? That is it . The key . The locked door . That cagelike porch through which we entered the building. 26One of our friends has roped me into doing a prison novel . That would be Gus . Being a newspaperman he could manage to get me in , I suppose . But I will not go through with it . I do n't care how many notes I have taken , after dinner I am going home . They halted at a door that was guarded by another woman fixed up to look like a nurse . This one waited until there was respectful silence and then she unlocked the door . The feeling was that you were about to go into a chapel to view the remains of a great saint . The new guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet of paper . As the women filed past her she made checks on the paper . There will be a special notation after my name : writer , here to observe . The new guide , no , you must think of them as guards now that you knew this was jail , was rather nice-looking . She was not pretty , but she had a sweet face and that was a change from Miss Wildebeest Hart . " Cut the shoving , ladies , " said the sweet-faced one out of the corner of her daintily rouged mouth . The dining room was not so large as the waiting room but it was oblong and painted in the same dull way . There were four rows and in each row were four tables and at each table were six chairs . " No , " said Grace , when Virginia very naturally accompaniedher to a table . " Please , Virginia , do n't make any trouble . You have to go to your own table . " Make trouble ? My own table ? Virginia shrugged . Grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell her , might save her much trouble later on . But how can27you suggest to a person that she go to a psychiatrist ? Peo- ple go to a psychiatrist as secretly as they go to an abor- tionist . At the moment it was best to humor Grace . If she did n't want you to sit with her , very well . Perhaps she thought she would be stuck with the check . I 'll have to sign for my dinner , come to think of it . Someone cleaned my bag of money . I would n't mind the money so much if they had left my glasses . . . . Here was a vacant chair . As Virginia hesitated beside it a woman shoved her roughly . " Get away from my chair , you , " said the woman . " I beg your pardon , " said Virginia . " I did n't know it was yours . " " I 'm reporting you the next time , " said the woman fiercely . " Watch out or you 'll be sorry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , you did n't care to dine at that table . She went to another one but here again she paused at the wrong chair . Another woman , quite as outraged as the first but . not shoving , bawled for Miss Hart . " Miss Hart ! Virginia will not take her own place . She is on the wrong side again . " " I 'm sorry , " said Virginia . " I did n't see the seating chart . Not having my glasses .... " " Alibi Al , " said the woman . " Glasses yet . " Miss Hart had not heard , or had not cared to interfere . Virginia got around to the other side of the table where she took the remaining empty chair . Nobody objected . The woman at her left even smiled . " Hello hello hello , " she said . " Hello , Virginia . " " Hello , " said Virginia . " Hello , " said the woman . " Hell 's low and heaven 's high . " " Huh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you think. 28If you knew what I know , you would laugh on the other side of your face . " " Not being two-faced like some I could mention , " said the cheerful woman , " I say hello again . " " No talking , ladies , " shouted Miss Hart . " You see , " said the gloomy one . The other two women opposite said nothing . The woman at Virginia 's right breathed hard through a most aristocratic nose . Where were the waiters ? There were no menus . I would have preferred the European Plan , but in a prison even a visitor ca n't expect de-luxe service . Then Miss Hart and the other blue-and-white one came with a steam wagon . They put two bowls on each table . One bow I held what looked like a stew and the other was a mess of sliced beets fixed in a rigid gelatinous sauce as bright and inedible-looking as store cherry pie . The instantthe stew touched the table , the woman on Virginia 's right , the Nose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She selected the pieces with finicking care . During this process the woman on the left kept saying to save some for Virginia . It was thoughtful of her but also embarrassing . Really , you should treat me as one of you . Finally Virginia 's champion took the bowl from the Nose and Virginia leaned back . The Champion was going to serve her plate for her . How kind . But the Champion , once she had prized the bowl from the Nose 's fingers , served herself . Then she passed the bowl across the table . " Save some for Virginia , " she said to each of the three women on the other side of the table . Eventually the bowl came to Virginia . There was perhaps a full tablespoon of pale gravy left in it . In the gravy were a piece of potato , two slices of carrot and seven peas. 29Virginia counted them to make them last longer . The flavor of the gravy suggested that the meat had been sheep . Goat , really , but surely this was not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beets . " Never mind , " said Virginia . " I do n't care much for them . " She thought she said this aloud , but no one paid any attention . The Nose stirred her beets into her magnificentportion of stew . She did an excellent job of blendingthe brown and the red and then she took a piece of bread from the plate in the center of the table . She ate the bread . She did not eat even a thread of the meat or a droplet of the raspberry-shaded sauce she had labored to achieve . Virginia took a piece of bread . She was not quick enough to get in on the butter . Several of the women ate the butter as if the little squares were candies . The bread , as Virginia had said , was good . I must be sure to tell Robert the bread is good . It will cheer him up . She had no idea why , but she felt as if Robert needed cheering up . Why ? He was happy . He had wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning , or another morningnot long ago , he was saying , was n't it wonderful to be in New York . Queer how far away it seemed . Queer she felt as if not so long ago she had been lying in a coffin and Robert had been standing near , weeping . Crazy dream . For a minute she toyed with the idea that she had died . She had read a book like that once . For a long time the character could n't figure out where he was and then it developed that he was dead and in heaven . This place , however , this place of the zoo smell and the locked doors could not be heaven and Virginia 's church had renounced hell some years ago. 3oMy trouble is , the need of a good meal . Even another piece of bread . . . . She reached and was successful . " Leave some for the Countess , " said the Champion . " By all means , " said Virginia . To show that she had caught on to the playful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth as fast as she could . There were two good bites left when the crust was snatched from her . " Thank you , dear . " She turned and saw a great black hulk . The old woman looked exactly the way a countess should look . She was fat and dressed in rusty silk that went down to her heels . Her hair was built into a beehive of yellowish white and the hand that had taken the bread was grimy . There was an expression of affability on the large flabby face . " Thank you one and thank you all , " she said . She held the bread in a basket made of her jutting bosom and one of her hands . After going the rounds of the tables she wadded to one of the narrow windows and threw the bread out . " Why does she do that ? " asked Virginia . I could have eaten it . " Questions yet , " commented the cross one . " For the birds , " said the Champion . " They are her little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being sent at great rate down to the end of the table . Dessert . Virginia hoped it would be substantial . Apple pie a la mode . She helped slide the dishes on and Miss Hart came and put them on her wagon . Then she gave each diner a dear little aluminum pan . Virginia had n't much time to see what was in her pan . She hoped it was lemon custard ; she had never been fond of lemon custard . The Champion swept the pan from her , emptied the31custard into her own pan . " There you are , " she said , as she returned Virginia 's dish . Virginia started to say something sarcastic , but then she noticed the Champion 's eyes . " Thank you , " she said . She said it sincerely because she realized that her champion wished her well and labored , though obscurely , to that end . " That 's all right , " said the woman . " I 've got children of my own . " Her words were thickened by custard but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of herself . It is vulgar to be so concerned about your stomach . Especiallywhen you can have anything you want as soon as you reach home . These poor - tvomen are stuck here until they get their diplomas or until they have served their time or whatever it is they are here about . It is n't right to spy on them . I can not believe they are hardened criminals ... Well , that one directly across  --  she might be a lifer . I wonder if I have jotted down the jargon . The wrong language would make the book a phony . Let me see , you say rap for sentence ? Or rap for what you did to earn the sentence ? What crime would Grace have committed ? Libel ? Dared you ask her ? But she might be here for an investigation . They do such sneaking things to get their stories . I wo n't . I 'll tell the person who put me up to this that I will not do it . I will not betray those poor women . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of their meal , to feed the birds . More than likely nothing more than sparrows . " All right , ladies , " shouted Miss Hart . That would be something a modern penologist had thought up , that calling them ladies . Call them ladies and they will act like ladies . I should think somewhat betterfood might be more encouraging but of course that would cost money . It costs no money for Miss Hart to blat out Ladies . Find a telephone and call Robert . Look , darling , I 'll say , it was n't such a hot idea . You were right . I do n't want to do that sort of book . And listen , honey , stop at Gristede 's and pick up a steak before you come for me . I 've been watching them eat and it 's given me a terrific appetite . And , honey , get some of that twenty-five-cent bread , will you ? Just this once. ivThey lined up in front of the dining-room door . When the door was unlocked they marched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if any of them had died of the meal ? They marched up the brown hall and stopped at the door at the end of it . Miss Hart unlocked the door and they went into the waiting room . They crossed that room and paused at another door . Miss Hart unlocked the door . They went into another hall . They stopped at another door . When it was unlocked they went into a room that was stunningly different . It was a large light room . There was tile on the floor , tiny octagonal pieces of tile charmingly fitted together and so white and clean . The walls had the two-color paint job but they seemed more cheerful . It was a lovely room . Virginia studied the floor as if it was an exceptional mosaic and she thought suddenly of her beautiful Kelim rug and had then to suppress a ridiculous and unexpected sob . Do n't be a baby . Suppose you had to stay here . If I had to remain in this prison I would choose this room , she thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The women stood and waited for their turn . Anyhow , that was the idea . Your turn was n't necessarily when you thought . It depended a good deal on where Miss Hart was . The pushing was done quietly and with no hard feeling . Virginia changed from line to line but it was no use ; none of the booths had a door . When at last it was her uncontested turn she discovered that an even more vital accessory was missing . There was no wooden seat and the old joke about not falling in was in this case no joke . But she forgot how frightful this was when she saw there was no toilet . paper , no toilet tissue as you would call it in Evanston . There was n't even an empty container . Nor any holes to indicate that there had ever been a dispenser . She was about to call to her next neighbor , but then she remembered the cleansing tissues in her handbag . When she left the booth she peered at the walls of the other three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported . As a rule she held back and let others do the reporting but now she was angry and she went to Miss Hart to say what is the idea of not providing these women with toilet paper . When she reached Miss Flart she saw that the woman was providing toilet paper . Miss Hart was the dispenser . If you required paper you asked her for it in advanceand she doled it out to you . She was the judge of how much you needed . It was a curious and humiliating procedure . Had n't they gone deep enough into a woman 's privacy when they removed the doors from the booths ? You had to admit , though , that the floors were cleaner than the floors of any public washrooms you had ever had the misfortune to be in . The usual public toilet is strewn with paper and of course that must exasperate the clean-34ing women . The system here seemed a bit drastic , though . " Virginia , " said Grace , " could I bum another cigarette ? I 'm ashamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do n't be silly , " said Virginia . She opened her bag . " Here are cigarettes but I have n't any matches . " " That 's what I like about you , " said Grace . " No matter what , you always have a joke . " " I 'd rather have a light just now , " said Virginia . What a nuisance it is to be one of these unconscious wits . You have always to pretend you meant to be funny and that you see the point . " That 's rich , " said Grace . She laughed as she took three cigarettes from the pack . " Come on . " They and the other women clustered around Miss FIart . Miss Hart had exchanged the toilet paper for a handful of kitchen matches . When she struck a match the women tried to get four or more lights from it . Did they think three could bring them worse luck than they already had ? When they had got their lights they sat down to enjoy their smokes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hart sat on it and watched . The others sat on the nice white floor and leaned back against the brown wall . It was something like being at a studio party , except that now and then the hostess would scream for them to watch their ashes . " Watch your ashes , ladies ! " " Make me one of your cute little ashtrays , " said Grace . Virginia reached into the ratsnest of her bag and found a piece of paper . She tore the paper in two and she made a cone of each piece . She tore a latch to hold each cone togetherand this seemed to be what Grace had wanted . When she had given one of the cones to her friend she noticed that Miss Hart was looking at her with affection . Perhaps Miss Hart had to scrub the floor. 35The smoking was a chain proposition . You were allowed three cigarettes but only one light . When Virginia had lit a fresh cigarette from her stub she dropped the butt into the cone and gave it a quick squeeze . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became scorched . Vaguely you remembered times when you had n't had any paper , when you had had to put a cigarette out in the palm of your hand . You could spit into your hand first . I must have dreamed this nonsense . Miss Hart got up . When she had gone from the washroomone lady , the daredevil of the group , perched on the chair for a moment , but she was back on the floor when Miss Hart returned . The guard was shoving a sort of rack that dress shops use for Special Values . Swinging from the rack were white sacks . Miss Hart put the rack in the center of the room and the ladies stopped smoking and began to undress . Virginia started toward Miss Hart to ask where a telephone was but somehow she did n't go through with it . She had a feeling that she was not a free agent and that she had to stay overnight . This was absurd . She was no criminal and no one could keep her shut up . All she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have to say it if she knew the way out , or if she had one of those keys . " Forty-three , " said Grace . " You 've got to remember it . I do n't know what you 'll do when I leave . You never remember your number . " Forty-three . The hangers on the rack were numbered . I am forty-three . She found the hanger and took it from the rack . The white sack was supposed to represent a nightgown . It was enormous and made of material suitable for tents . The number forty-three was stamped on the gar-36ment as a sort of trim . The neck was deep and wide and the sleeves were butterfly . The system was simple . You hung your clothes on the hanger and put your shoes under the place numbered forty-three . Remembering athlete 's foot Virginia hurriedly put her shoes back on . No one had bedroom slippers but she noticed that several of the women used their shoes . The majority , however , braved fungus . There were four washbowls and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . Virginia found soap in her bag and so could ignore the questionable piece that lay beside the bowl . Next to her a woman sat in the washbowlto give herself an intimate bath . Virginia rushed through her washing just in case the plumbing should collapse . She supposed they would n't blame her but it was as well to be in another part of the room . " Meditation , ladies , " announced Miss Hart . This was too much . You would not join them in evening prayers . Virginia had nothing against prayers , but she did not care to be included . She was extremely tired . The others could run along and pray if they wished . But the ubiquitous , mind-reading Grace spoke up . " You 've got to take medication , Virginia . You have got to take it as long as you are on the list . " " Medication ? I thought she said meditation . " " Sue , " said Grace , " you take Virginia to medication . I 'm not on the list any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was almost fat enough for the prison gown . " Come on . " She had a Dutch bob , always the favorite cut of square-faced , dark , fat women . She looked as if she might make trouble if you did n't come on , and although Virginia felt she would almost rather meditate than medicate , she came on. 37They and several other women went through the hall to a room they called the office . At a desk was a woman in white uniform and cap , just as if she was an R.N. She was serving something in lilycups . Sue graciously let Virginia go ahead but fortunately she was not the first in the line and so was able to watch the procedure . The guard poured something into a lilycup and the prisoner drank it down . While the victim choked and sputtered the guard refilled the cup from another pitcher and this was drunk gratefully . One woman just ahead of Virginia knocked the cup from the guard 's hand , but the white uniform simply filled another cup and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And so did Virginia chink what was handed to her . It was a worse drink than she had expected . " This beats Martin 's gin , " she gasped . The guard would n't know who Martin was or how he had made such awful gin during prohibition days , but the remark was wrenched from your stinging throat . " Virginia , " said the guard as you drank the water chaser , " you are a card . " " What is that stuff ? " Virginia asked Grace when she met her in the hall a moment later . " Formaldehyde , " said Grace . " Jesus , " said Virginia . If she had n't been so weary she would have gone to the washroom and put her finger down her throat . She and Grace went to a sort of dormitory . Grace got into one of the cots and Virginia got into the one next to Grace 's . No one threw her out and so it must have been the right cot . She had put her bag under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was getting too dark to read but she did not intend to try . She slipped one of38Robert 's letters from the packet and put it under her pillow and then she felt safer . They are doing their best , but it will take more than formaldehyde . Outside of the dormitory someone was screaming . The dormitory , like the toilet booths , had no door and so you heard things easily . Drowsily Virginia imagined running down the hall to rescue the screamer . But then there was quiet . " Grace ? " " Yes . " " How long have we been here ? ' " You mean here in Three ? " " No , just here in general . " " I came in January . You came around the first of Feb-ruary . " February ? I 'd thought it was summer . " What month is this ? " " August . " Just like that .

" Who had got into the room ? Stealthily she groped for Robert . I must put my hand over his mouth so he wo n't speak out . But the bed was narrow and she was alone . The room was dark but she saw pale shapes rising up . One of the shapes said her name and then she remembered that she was not at home . February to August . " Yes , " she said . She got out of the cot , fumbled for the bag under the bed and then put on her shoes. 39 " Hurry up . " " I am . " Always the command to hurry and you hurried nowhere , you arrived nowhere . The shoes were cold and clammy and they squished up and clown when you walked . After she had followed Grace into the hall she remembered the letter and so she went back and took it from under the pillow . When she returned to the hall Grace had vanished but there were other ghosts that rushed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning and she wondered if this might be a fire drill . She followed the shapes into the washroom . Although it was the same room it had been moved to the other end of the hall . She would not give them the satisfaction of commenting on the change . She found her hanger and began to dress . " Virginia ! You do n't take breakfast this morning . " Then why not let me stay in bed , fool ? She turned and there was another guard , not Miss Hart , a smaller one but with a big voice . Not that I took dinner last night , but thank you just the same for saving me the bother of the trip . " All right , " she said . Perhaps Robert is coming to take me away . She continued to dress . Now this one that was not Miss Hart came over to her and took her by the shoulders and shook her . " You put your clothes right back on that hanger . " This guard had puffy cheeks and her rouge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a black-silk net and she looked as if she had been up all night . " You know you go for shock . Hurry up or you 'll be late . " It was quaint of the guard to think you had to go elsewherefor a shock . But Virginia put her clothes back onthe hanger and again got into the grotesque nightgown . " You 'll have to concentrate , " whispered Grace . " Itmakes her so mad when you forget . And it counts against you . " " Where am I going ? " " For shock . You remember . " Do I ? I remember it no more than I remember the house where I was born and the little window . Going for shock . An odd , foreign expression . Sensation seekers go to be shocked ; I never heard anyone say go for shock , as if it was a commodity like the morning milk . Presently she and the guard were the only ones left in the washroom . The guard handed her a gray terrycloth robe . " Put this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on the hanger . Hurry up . " In the hall the guard turned her over to another one in blue and white , one who had n't put on any rouge this morning . Virginia and the pale one went through the large room and they reached the outer corridor in time to trail along with the last of the breakfast ladies , but they did not go into the dining room with the breakfast ladies . As they turned at a door just beyond the dining room door Virginia noticed a third door . It had gold letters on it . It looked familiar but she was unable to make out the letters . The pale one unlocked the door she had selected and they went into a cement stair-well and started to climb . After several flights the pale one unlocked another door and they went into another brown corridor . The pale one escorted her to a small room and left her there . All of this was done without any comment . Well , I do n't feel like talking before I 've had my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the small room and there were two windows . Virginia tried to open one of the windows and was surprised to find that she could . The window opened down the center to make40 41two slits . They might as well have had bars . It was beginning to get light . The sky had a sick , lemon cast at the horizon . Three robed women were ushered in . One of them sat down ; the other two stood in the center of the room . No one said anything . After a while a guard came and took one of the robed women away . There was pink in the sky now . The pink was turning to red when another woman was taken away . It was nearly light when Virginia was taken . She was taken down the hall to a little room and the moment she saw that room she knew she had been shocked previously and that she ( lid not care for another helping . The room smelled like her old electric egg beater and there was a dull red glass eye in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downstairs , " she said . " You go right on in , " said the guard . " Good morning , Virginia . " This was quite a different voice . It was so pleasant that it was silly . It dripped the sort of cheery good will that is hard to take any morning , especially a morning when you have a formaldehyde hangover . " Good morning , " said Virginia in a tone which she meant to indicate that she wished not to discuss it further . There was a high table , like an operating table , and she knew she was supposed to get up on it . She got on it and the woman with the silly voice fussed around her . This woman was in an R.N. uniform and the room had somewhatthe appearance of an operating room . I 'd forgotten I was to have an operation . You do n't eat before an operation , of course . I should have remembered . I wonder what I am being operated on for . What have n't I had removed ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jeannie . And how is Jeannie this morning ? " It was he , the Indefatigable Examiner , come out from the bushes . He was wearing a white coat . He had blue eyes and a hawkish nose and a very slender face and his hair was fair and curly , like Grace 's , only shorter . " And did you enjoy being outside in the park yesterday ? " He said this with a heavy accent that you had never been able to place . It was n't German , French , Italian or Scandinavian . Polish , perhaps . He began to talk at great rate but you could tell he did n't care if you translated or replied . He and the silly woman were busy with their hands . Evidently it was to be a local anesthetic . They put a wedge under her back . It was most uncomfortable . It forced her back into an unnatural position . She looked at the dull glass eye that was set into the wall and she knew that soon it would glow and that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrocute her , not operate upon her . Even now the woman was applying a sort of foul-smelling cold paste to your temples . What had you done ? You would n't have killed anyone and what other crime is there which exacts so severe a penalty ? Could they electrocute you for having voted for Norman Thomas ? Many people had said the country was going to come to that sort of dictatorship but you had n't believed it would ever reach this extreme . Dare they kill me without a trial ? I demand to see a lawyer . And he  --  he always talking about hearing voices and never hearing mine ... He , pre-tendingto be so solicitous of me and not even knowing my name , calling me Jeannie . If I say I demand a lawyer they have to do something . It has to do with habeas corpus , something in the Constitution . But they and their smooth talk , they intend to make a corpus of me  --  they and their good mornings and how are you. 42 - 43IINow the woman was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and here came another one , another nurse-garbed woman and she leaned on your feet as if in a minute you might rise up from the table and strike the ceiling . Your hands tied down , your legs held down . Three against one and the one entangled in machinery . She opened her mouth to call for a lawyer and the silly woman thrust a gag into it and said , " Thank you , dear , " and the foreign devil with the angelic smile and the beautifulvoice gave a conspiratorial nod . Soon it would be over . In a way you were glad. 44CHAPTER THREESHE was walking down a sloping hallway . At the head of the procession bobbed a white cap . When the cap stopped moving the women stood still . They were standing near a door that had gold letters but when they turned they entered another door . " Come along , Virginia , " said the White Cap . " This way . " " But that 's my door , " said Virginia . " He 's not there now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it snappy . We have n't got all day . " Why not ? What comes next ? I have all day . He said so . He said I had nothing to worry about , no meetings to attend , no parties to give , no house guests coming . But I have been in this room before . It is a dining room . It is where we eat . I am wise . I know things . But do I know the plan of the tables ? If you select the wrong chair something awful happens . Oh , wisdom , guide my feet . She shut her eyes and when she opened them she was beside a chair and a woman was saying hello . The woman continued to say hello and soon she was saying to save some for Virginia . Yes , this was familiar . The bowls swam past . " No , no , please , " said Virginia . " Please . I do n't want any . " 45 " Sh , " whispered the woman at her left . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bowls came to Virginia she remembered that it was an axiom . To get the others to eat you said to save some for Virginia . A proverb , a law . Your share of the process was to take what was left and they were kind and left you only enough to soil your plate . You spread the dabs to make them look like the last bits you had n't been able to finish and thus you avoided punishment . The kind woman at your left had arranged this . The woman on the right was not eating . She was stirring a plateful of food around and around . A wave of nausea washed through Virginia and she took a piece of bread and crumbled it into her plate . Across the table a brown-eyed girl smiled . " I am Margaret , " she said . It was a shock to hear Mag 's name . " Margaret ? " " I just came today . From Four . " " I 'll remember your name . It is my sister 's . " Virginia bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes . She cleared her throat and blew her nose on the paper napkin . " I 've not seen her for a while . Silly of me , but we 've always been quite close . " " No talking , ladies , " called out the woman who was pushing a cart toward their table . When the plates were collected the waitress gave each of the women a pan of something that quivered . I would rather die than eat it . But then the woman at the left took the disgusting stuff and dumped it into her pan . " Oh , thank you , " said Virginia . " You 're the best friend I have here . " " Do n't mention it , " said the Champion . She turned . " You are late , Countess , but I saved it . " She opened her napkin and displayed a collection of bread scraps. 46 " Thank you , dear , " said the collector . " They appreciate your kindness . " Virginia wanted to ask who they were but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did not want the Champion to become impatient . Without that one 's good will you would have to do your own eating . They served execrable food here and like all bad cooks , expected you to eat heartily . They became vindictive if you did not eat . They mashed the food into a mush and pushed it up your nose . No , I have dreamed that . That could never happen . Across the aisle was a beautiful girl . Of course without your glasses you could n't tell from here but you had seen her close up and you knew she was beautiful and that her name was Rosa . Rosa had cried in the washroom . Someonehad broken her bottle of perfume . She kept saying that her brothers gave it to her and that it cost five dollars . Now Rosa pushed her chair back . She stood up and started to make a speech . I wonder if I 'm to make one . He said not to worry about having to make any more speeches ; he said I never would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speeches I am sure I am one of the speakers . If I could only remember my subject . I must listen carefully when they introduce me . Rosa is the chairman . But this is awkward . Rosa was speaking in Italian . Virginiadid not understand Italian but she could recognize it . And knowing that Rosa was an Italian helped . The girl spoke brilliantly and she used magnificent gestures . She raised a fist and beat her chest . Almost at once you caught on that she was imitating Mussolini . The two white-capped waitresses did n't reach the speaker right away . They scurried around their steam wagon and ran into each other . One of them knocked a47stack of plates from the cart and they stopped to pick them up . The plates did not break . They were metal . They made a frightful clatter and Rosa had to raise her voice . Rosa was not simply imitating Mussolini , for the time being she was Mussolini . Everyone was much impressed and they frowned at the waitresses . The Nose , the aristocratwho dined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , " Quiet , you fools . " When the waitresses reached the speaker they did not apologize for their rudeness . Great strapping women that they were , they laid hands on the delicate Rosa and took her from the dining room so rapidly that you were not certainif they carried her or walked her . For the first time in history we are alone . Now my speech . Ladies ! Now is our chance to organize . Unless we organize we are lost . Are we going to continue to accept this oppression ? United we have great strength . Let us organize . Can we sit here and let them do God knows what to Comrade Rosa ? They broke her bottle of perfume and pretended one of us did it . Next , they will be blaming us for the poor quality of the food . . . . ( You have to work a joke in somewhere . ) But all joking aside , ladies , do we not owe it to those who will come after us to . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat adapted from Helene but she felt that in general it was not communistic . She prepared to rise . Before she was on her feet , one of the waitresses stormed into the room . " All right , ladies , " she squalled. iiThere was no conversation in the washroom . The women sat on the floor and smoked and when the White48Cap said to watch their ashes , they watched the White Cap . I would be afraid if I were that one , but I suppose she carries a gun . Packs a gat , she would say . She is a tough one . The tough one smiled . She was smiling at Virginia . Virginialooked down at the paper cone she was using for an ash tray and then she remembered that the White Cap was Miss Hart . I have done her the favor of watching my ashes and the ashes of others , she can do me a favor now . " Miss Hart ? " " Yes , Virginia . " " I wonder if I might have my glasses . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Eyeglasses . Spectacles . " " I did n't know you wore glasses . You have n't had any since you 've been here in Three . " " I have never been without them before , " said Virginia . " I always have two pairs , in case one should break . I am very nearsighted . " And without them I can never figure out how to escape , my friend . " Why do n't you ask Miss Graves ? Go to the office now , if you like . She might know something about them . " Virginia left the washroom and after a while she found a room that had a desk in it and she supposed this might be called an office . " Miss Graves ? " she said to the woman who was sitting at the desk . " Well , Virginia , what can I do for you ? " There were two pitchers on the desk . White-enamel pitchers . There was a package of paper cups . One of those pitchers contained water , the other held poison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Graves . That was supposed to be a joke and so Virginia forced49her lips into a curve . " I wonder if I could have my glasses . I 'm very uncomfortable without them . " " Glasses ? I did n't know you wore glasses . " " They have to be somewhere around . Robert  --  my husband would n't let me be without them . " Yes , but what can Robert do for a person who is in the clutches of the Law ? He had got the reprieve , that much was certain . They had not completed the electrocution . You were unconsciouswhen the papers came . It had been a close call . " I 'll inquire at the main office , " said Miss Graves . " Not all of your things were sent to this ward . I 'll make a note of it . " " Thank you , " said Virginia . " I really think if I 'm withoutthem much longer I 'll go crazy . " She had n't spoken loudly , but the word , that last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graves stared down at her papers . " I 'll get diem for you , " she said in a strained voice . " You go back to the washroom now and get ready for bed . You could n't use them tonight . Tomorrow . Yes , I 'll have them for you tomorrow . " Slowly Virginia groped her way back to the washroom . She knew now . She really had been knowing it a long time but now she had to admit that she knew it . All along she had known that the electrocution and crime idea was nonsense . All along she had known where she was . Oh , she did not know the geography of it , but she knew , she knew . As she started to undress she thought about how carefullyshe had invented the prison fantasy . All along she had known where she was , but she had invented a setting5othat was easier to endure . Anything else would have been easier to bear , anything but what it was . I knew , I knew , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ward was a woman who every day went out on the cage porch during the brief airing period . She went out there and yelled swear words at the bushes and benches of the courtyard , but she never used the terrible word that Virginia had used when she had spoken to Miss Graves just now . It was one of the words that were not used here , words that were common enough outside and never consideredblasphemous but words that were never said here , even by the most foul-mouthed . You could say anything here so long as you did not say the truth . Around you in the washroom were women who were shut up with you , women who were far more wretched than criminals . I was trying to glamorize it . What it is , is the one thing I can not take . I could face the prospect of blindness , of cancer , but this , no . Never this . How had it happened ? She remembered now that her friend Grace had said she was glad that it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . I never heard of anything like this in my family . Mother 's side or Dad 's side . There was old Aunt Essie but she was n't a blood relative ; she was Gran 's second cousin 's wife . But even Aunt Essie was n't this way . Peculiar , that was all . When Grampa said she ought to be shut up he did n't mean it . He only meant he wished she would keep out of his way . How , how can Robert endure it ? When she got into her cot she realized that she had neglected something that was very important . Robert must get a divorce . It was possible in some states . Any good lawyer could manage it for him . He must be the way the51Jacksons are about Don . Mrs. Jackson told me last time I was home that she does n't go to see Don any more . He does n't know me now and it just does me up and finally Mr. Jackson put his foot down and said I could n't go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as dead and he is . My real boy is dead . He 's happy . Yes , he 's happy . They take good care of him and he 's happy . Lying there in the fading light Virginia remembered Don Jackson , the way he was before . He was older than she but she remembered him clearly . Such a nice-looking boy and so smart in school . They said , when it happened to him , that he was too smart , that it happened to people who were too smart . Was that any consolation ? Could you say to yourself that you were too smart ? You were never any quiz kid , Virginia . Do n't add delusionsof grandeur to whatever it is you already have . For about two years , said Mrs. Jackson , he knew us . I never went through such a time . It was much worse for us then , really , though of course then we still had hopes . Will I know Robert for about two years and then . . . ? He must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be eighty . Look at Gran and Grampa . I might not be lucky enough to take after the Stuarts who died young , and anyhow a lot of them lived to be seventy or so . " Grace ... . But Grace had gone away . She had been happy about leaving and she had said it would n't be long before she would be back at work on her newspaper . They had promised to hold her job for her , she said . Does it mean I might get well ? I know someone who did . Mary Someone . Silly Mary , they call her . Harmless graduate of an institution , but they call her Silly Mary . I would rather be Silly Virginia shut up than Silly Virginiaat large . Robert , Robert , Robert . Happier there than he would be at home , said Mrs. Jackson , even if we could take proper care of him . Better off with his own kind . Someone was talking . Is this a voice the Examiner desiredme to hear ? Last night , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard your voices . " They ca n't do it to me , " said the voice . " I 'll get the Law on them . I 've got friends . They better watch out how they treat me . " " Shut up , " said another voice . " Shut up and go to sleep . " " You ca n't talk to me like that , " said the first voice . " I 'll have the Law on you . I got friends . You watch your mouth when you talk to me . " And then someone began to weep . Virginia decided these were not the voices he sought . She was reminded , by the weeping , of an article she had read . It was an articleabout a place like this . No , not a place like this . The writer had pretended to be speaking for all such places but his description would never fit this one . When I read the article I was glad . I was thinking about Don . The writer made it sound fascinating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every one of the people he wrote about was engaged in something important . There were men who thought themselves great lawyers and they were busy writing , or thinking about writing , briefs that would make history ; there were men who thought themselves financial wizards with millions and billions of dollars under their control ; women who thought themselves famous beauties ; women who thought themselveshistorical or mythical characters . Everything in the way of comfort was provided these dreamers and they had n't a worry in the world . The author made a gentlejoke about his envy of their lot . They dwell in dreams , he wrote . " There are also nightmares , " said Virginia . She hadspoken aloud . I spoke aloud and not to anyone within hearing . I am one of them . Here in this bare dormitory that had no door , here on the narrow cot , clothed in a numbered nightgown , she lay with women who were insane and she was one of them . CHAPTER FOURMRS . ROBERT P. CUNNINGHAM , Juniper Hill Hospital . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All you had had to do was look , which was of course why you had not looked . Though you had known without looking , it was far harder when you knew and looked at the same time . You were horrified and ashamed , as if it was something you had done on purpose . She tried to dig out her memory but it was swathed in wet gray chiffon that stuck to the very part she wanted most to examine . You needed to get inside of your head and clean the place up . It was easy enough to remember things that had happened a long time ago , even a year ago . It was about a year ago that we moved to a suburb . Without much effort she recalled the names of the young people with whom she and Robert had lived for several months . I remember the kitten that used to ride on the trail of my housecoat every morning when I went down to get breakfast . It was a co-operative house , set up according to rules and regulations . Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As cook I was queen . The others gaped and marveled at the most simple achievements . This was after Robert had taken a job , just after he had decided it was time to call the vacation over . Virginia had assumed they would go back home at the end of the long vacation , but Robert wanted to stay . She was fond of New York but it was n't the same when Robert was working . That was why Robert accepted the invitation to the co-operative . " Then you wo n't be alone , " he said . No , she was never alone in that big old house . It was a house rule that when your bedroom door was closed you were safe but always , no matter how loudly she pounded her typewriter , someone tapped at the door . Ginny , are you too busy to let me come in a minute ? Something I want to show you . Something I have to ask you . . . . No one takes a writer 's business seriously . It is something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . It was n't so much that she was eager to be at her work ; it was mostly that she could not endure always being at a party . The co-operative was an endless house party . Althoughthe members were all employed there was always at least one who was having a day off , a week off , an hour off . Ginny , I suddenly remembered that you might be left alone today and so I brought my work home . . . . They were all so young . I had n't known until then that Robert and I had stopped being young . They were always talking , laughing , singing , dancing . They were always quoting . Their erudition was appalling . Though they seemed never to read , their supply of brilliant quotationswas endless . They spoke patronizingly of the authors whose vocabularies they used casually , and for all Virginia knew , correctly . They were sorry for Virginia and said it was too bad she could n't do a novel with Social Significance . They themselves would do surveys and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would bring the world into co-operation -- when they had time . But there was time for laughter , time for song . It was marvelous for three days . It may have been marvelous for Robert a bit longer . He was seldom there . His job was a conglomeration of days and nights and split shifts , but before long he said he wondered if he and Virginia exactly fitted in . He and she agreed , though perhaps with less enthusiasm than they had had before , that if they were to live with anyone it would be with these young people who were so bright and so loving . " But it 's the sort of thing you keep thinkingyou should go home from , " said Robert , " and then you realize that you are home . " Virginia 's mother had been writing frantically . She did not understand why they were staying in the East ; someone had told her that co-operative house was almost entirelyJewish  --  not that she minded but she did wish Virginia would n't tell other people things and not tell her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that from other people ; only the other day someone had asked her if it was true that there were Negroes in the house also . At least you can come home for a visit , she wrote . You absolutely must come home for a visit . If Robert ca n't come you must come without him . " You should go , " said Robert . " It will give you a rest from these maniacs and then we 'll see . " He said she must have a new coat . She shopped and shopped and finally she found a good bargain . She adored a bargain . She never really liked a dress or a coat or a hat that had n't had a price marked out and a lower one added . The new coat was a silvery shade of green and the collar was real beaver . It was a very small collar but it was realbeaver . When her mother saw the coat she said it was the kind that absolutely had to have a matching hat . She took Virginia to her milliner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coat had cost . Virginia planned to stay in Evanston two weeks but she was too tired . Every time she got on the bathroom scales she weighed less . And she was having trouble sleeping . This was n't entirely new trouble but she thought when she got back into a regular routine it would be different . So she returned to New York and when Robert met her he said they were moving back to Manhattan . " We 'll take such a small apartment that we ca n't have any company from home , " he said . I ca n't remember that little apartment , but I know we found it . We moved from the co-operative house to a little apartment in Greenwich Village . Strange not to be able to remember your home . You are coming near . Grace said February . We decided not to have the furniture sent on . Just the rugs and dishes and silver . We bought furniture . We bought a large studio bed and I made a cover for it and that was our davenport . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we had them but I ca n't visualize them . On our wedding anniversary Robert gave me the muff . January twentieth . You came in February , said Grace . On the twentieth of January I was with Robert and he gave me a dear little round ball of beaver and I made him tell me how much it cost . " You and Mother ! " I said to him . He had paid more for the muff than I had paid for the coat . And thinking we were nearing the end of our money I had shopped myself limp for furniture and got the apartmentfixed up on next to nothing . Such a practical man . That is what they always say about Robert . My , they say , it 's a good thing Virginia Stuart married a practical man . She has n't got a grain of sense . As soon as the apartment was finished she got down to her book and worked eight hours a day . Sometimes these work days were at night , when Robert was working . One week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was another way . She never got it through her head . She tried to match his schedule but she was never able to sleep in the daytime . She was beginning to be unable to sleep at any time . They had become involved in a number of organizations . Robert was on numerous ways-and-means committeesand she was on committees of fine arts and program and things like that . Through their organization work they met very interesting people , writers , painters , musicians , teachers , social workers , newspaper people and so on . They entertained a good deal and they went many places . Robert assured her they were n't spending much more than he was making . For the first time in her life she began to wonder what the tired housewife would like to read . It had been weeks since she had had a full night 's sleep . She kept telling herself it made no difference . She would make it up eventually . Get tired enough and you would sleep . Some days she was so tired that she could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was never sleepy . Robert was beginning to worry about her . He kept saying she should go to a doctor , that she was too thin , that she did n't eat the right sort of food . He said why not knock off writing for a while . He was not in the least concerned about what the tired housewives of America were buying for their reading material . She had n't told him about not sleeping . Sometimes shethought she must imagine the sleepless nights . You could not lie awake all night . An hour or so , yes , but not all night . All night , night after night . It was impossible . Something would happen . What ? You would fall asleep . What else ? She counted sheep . She pretended she was molasses being poured out of a brown jug , poured from a brown jug into a thick stream that was inching slowly toward February , February , February ... . It was February then that morning at five when I got up from bed and took the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concealed pocket was a matching set , a coin purse , a compact and a lipstick . I wanted to weep when I saw how beautifully the pieces were made . Had I known he was going to take that much money out of the bank 1 would have made hull give it to me for curtains . I crept back into the bedroom that was also the living room . On the desk was the manuscript of my new book . It was the next-to-the-last draft and I was working it over in pencil . Even if the tired housewives did not become enthusiastic 1 felt sure it would do a little something for the bank account . To be poor in New York , though living was far cheaper there , seemed a more wretched prospect than poverty in Evanston . At home I would n't have cared about the housewives and their literary tastes ; I would have been laughing with Paula at Cassie . Cassie  --  now I was trying to be Cassie . The alarm rang and I hurried back to the big room . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know I had been working . " You up already ? " he asked . I knew then that I would have to tell him , that it was6otime . " I did n't sleep very well , " I said . I was dizzy and I had to catch hold of the chest of drawers . I remember it . It had a pink-marble top . " Robert , " I said , " I think there is something the matter with my head . " iiNo matter how often she went back she was unable to , get beyond that time which had not been time but past , way past the time . It was impossible to imagine what had happened ; you had nothing to go on . You had heard so much about Don Jackson but you had never heard exactly what happened just before he was taken away . You had n't even wondered . Poor Don lost his mind , people said , and they had to take him away . At first they thought he would get over it but he never did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did he say he thought there was something the matter with his head ? Did he have that moment 's warning ? Mary Lamb . She and Charles making the sad journey . She had ample warning  --  eventually . Perhaps I had also ; perhaps the not sleeping was my warning but I did not recognize it . I sleep now . I would sleep longer if they let me , if they did n't come and roust me out before dawn . I sleep , but there is still something the matter with my head . So it is more than a matter of insomnia . She was sitting in a wicker chair and she had been sitting there since lunch or dinner as they called it here and she was willing to keep on sitting . She was always tired . But Miss Hart came over to her . " How would you like to use the polisher , Virginia ? " she asked . Polisher ? Virginia had no desire to use a polisher , but obviously the question required an affirmative answer. 61Miss Hart , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with not dropping ashes on a white-tile floor . And so now Miss Hart was going to let you use a polisher . It was a thing that had a long handle and at the end of the handle was a heavy weight wrapped in gray blanket material . The idea was to push the polisher slowly over the linoleum . This was considered a privilege . Whenever anyone took the polisher away from Virginia she was grateful . For days Miss Hart 's chief concern was to give Virginia exclusive right to the polisher . When the nurse was occupied elsewhere some patient would snatch the long handle from Virginia , but as soon as the nurse returned she would shout , " You give that polisher back to Virginia , " and the wretched task would be resumed . Virginia had never had any strength in her arms and in order to make any progress at all she had to push more with her stomach than with her arms . It would have been a splendid reducing exercise for anyone needing reduction . Some of the women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mopped the halls and dormitories . They had buckets with wringer attachments and they had a collection of mops . And there were women who worked of a morning at making beds . The scrubbing and bedmakingwere finished soon after breakfast but the polishingwas never ended . It was tempting to believe the woman who boasted that she used the polisher all night long , every night . Miss Hart complimented Virginia extravagantly . " The best little polisher we ever had . " Oh , the nurse was devoted to Virginia ; sometimes she crossed the washroom to light Virginia 's cigarette and sometimes she gave her toilet paper without being asked . Next thing they will promote me to bed-making and62then I will be in a fix . I can never learn to turn a hospital corner . Sorry , I 'll say when they give me the assignment , but I never could turn a hospital corner . She looked at the slippery floor and giggled at her pun . The sound of the faint laughter startled her . She looked around apprehensively to see if anyone had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside , when she had longed to make her mind blank . It was n't that she had ever had tremendous problems  --  that might have been stimulating  --  butsometimes she had wished she might stop thinkingabout the committee agenda , about the Evanstonians who had to be taken to see Battery Park and the Empire State Building , and about how long you can continue to spend more than your income . Here at Juniper Hill she got her wish and she learned that having a blank mind while awake is a terrifying experience . She would be sitting in the large room  --  they called it the dayroom  --  and it would be early morning and then suddenly it would be time to go to bed . What had happened between morning and night ? She would not be able to remember having gone to the dining room but she would know she had been there twice since breakfast ; she would not remember having shoved the polisher but she would know she undoubtedlyhad been shoving it . Being teacher 's pet , she never had a day free of polishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't had to contend with in school . Although , she had been a good child she had n't looked it . The hair was responsible . A child with red hair automatically was considered a devil . Often she had laughed at her mother 's stories about what63a false reputation the older Stuart girl had got , but the laughter was never entirely mirthful . A favorite story was about Virginia 's first stage appearance . She was six years old . At a signal she and a dozen other first graders marched to the stage and stood in a row while other children , more favored by nature and teacher , did tricks . Mrs. Stuart , not in the least dampened by the walk-on role , was in the audience and probably dreaming of a theatrical future . Virginia had on a new white ruffled dress with a wide blue sash and around her head was a blue-satin ribbon with a rosette just above each ear . The color was an unfortunate choice as it made the straight fringed bob look far redder than it actually was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stubbornly played up to it . " That 's Virginia Stuart , that one with the red hair and the blue ear-bobs , " the admiring mother heard someonesay . " You know , Margaret Stuart 's child . She 's the meanest kid in town . " " And I turned around , " Mother would say , " and I saw it was Madge Anderson , a sorority sister of mine ! I gave her one look and I never spoke to her again . " Virginia would laugh . Everyone would laugh , but Virginia knew they were thinking Madge Anderson had been penalized for stating what must have been common knowledge . The only really wicked thing she could ever remember doing was putting a large angleworm down the back of an enemy . Her hatred for this girl was based on jealousy . The girl had braces on her legs and Virginia coveted those braces . Later it was tooth braces that she coveted . It seemed to her that all the top-flight children had braces on their teeth . She used to watch Libby snap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected way and she would long to be rich like Libby and have braces . Her mother 's telling her that she did n't need braces did not fool her one instant . All the rich kids had braces . At first glasses gave her a swank feeling and she made a great to-do about polishing them and waving them around under the noses of children who had n't glasses . But glasses soon came to be a nuisance , albeit a very essential nuisance . Several years before she and Robert came to New York for the long vacation there was a fad back home for curing poor eyes by exercises . There was a man in Chicago who made a specialty of this and Virginia went to him . It was very expensive . You sat in a darkened room and watched a series of lights flash about . The doctor  --  he called himself a doctor and maybe he was  --  said it was a matter of time . He was all in favor of her going without her glasses but of course she never could have found his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a chain of headaches that came to an end shortly after the course was finished , but several of her friends discarded their glasses and for quite some time went around looking as if from mouseholes . They promised to give me my glasses . Days ago . " I wonder if I might get my glasses soon , " she said to Miss Hart . " Glasses ? " said Miss Hart . Again Virginia went through the weary story of how she had worn glasses since childhood and how dependent she was upon them . Miss Hart was fascinated . She had a friend who had worn glasses a long time . She asked why Virginia had n't mentioned the matter before . Sometimes65it was difficult at Juniper Hill to remember which were the sick ones . Miss Hart boomed for her to come along to the office . They went to the office and a moment later Virginia had her glasses . " You see , " said the nurse , " all you have to do is ask . Do n't be shy . " Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whirled . " Oh , but these are n't mine , " she said . " Got your name on them . " Yes , there on one shaft , on a bit of adhesive was V. Cun- ningham in fine black printing . " Try them again , " said Miss Hart . " Maybe being with- out them so long . But if they are n't right you must n't wear them . " Virginia put the glasses on again . " Oh , they are fine , " she said quickly . She pretended they felt fine . " I suppose Iluxley is right , though . At least partly . " " Huxley ? " Miss I-Tart was arranging papers into a pile . She had a passion for neatness and no doubt everything about her person was scrupulously clean . She was , how- ever , one of those dark-skinned individuals who always look slightly dirty . " Not Julian , " said Virginia . " Though you would expect it to be him , would n't you ? " Yes , a nurse would think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and be- came interested in .... " " I know you are glad to have them back , " said Miss Hart . " Come on back to the dayroom . Let me leave a minute and the place is a  --  mess . " The oily skin reddened . " I forgot to tell you that you 're going to Petey this after- noon , " she said quickly . " Is n't that swell ? " And who is Petey ? My doctor ? Miss Hart is great on calling everyone by first name but would she dare call my 66 doctor by first name , even behind his back ? At least she might say Peter . In the dayroom the floor tilted but did not revolve . There were no blurred edges now . Already your eyes were responding to the old discipline . You knew that if you saw a good eye man at once you would be able to get weaker lenses . Maybe I should mention this to Petey this afternoon , before the adjustment to the strong lenses is complete . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember his last name . And in the past you had thought half blindness a burden . At Juniper Hill it was a blessing . How ugly the dayroom was . How much browner and plainer . How hideous the curtains were and how dreadfully the paint was checking from the wicker . You could see that the furniture had once been green and deep under the green was yellow . But the inanimate part of the dayroom was beautiful in comparison to the ladies . You bathed twice a week . You lined up for the showers . There were two stalls for the forty or fifty women who lived in Ward Three and in order to speed things up you were told to soap yourself before you got under the water . You reached a hand into the spray and caught enough moisture for a lather and in that way you could spend your bath time in rinsing . You might almost get completelyrinsed before the nurse would tell you to get out . Virginia had not , as yet , ever had a shower stall to herself even for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was indeed rarely that she had only one other woman in her bath . Once a week was fine-comb night . You squatted at Miss Hart 's feet and she went through your hair with a fine comb . Beside her on a stool was an enameled pan of some67clear fluid that you hoped was a strong antiseptic . She dipped the comb in that pan . The same comb was used on everyone . She combed you quickly and efficiently , if roughly , and that was that . These two processes , the showers and the fine combing , were the only organized efforts in the direction of personal cleanliness . Otherwise you were on your own . You did not have to wash or comb at any other time unless you chose . As far as Virginia could tell , all of the ladies chose . The four wash basins and the strip of mirror above them did not give much chance , though . When the way was less crowded you washed your pants and bra and stockings . You hung your washing on your private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , well , there was nothing else to wear . In the little black bag Virginia had make-up materials and bobbie pins but she seldom had enough time at the mirror to fix herself properly and there was no mirror in her bag . Not many of the ladies did anything about makeup , not many of them owned so much as a can of talcum powder . Several of them did work on their hair . Rosa , the Italian girl , had spent much time on her curls . What had they done with Rosa ? Virginia had overheard someone say that Rosa had been sent to pack but she did not believe this . You would n't be sent home when you were worse . " That 's silly , " she had said . She had turned around to join in the conversation about Rosa . " They would n't do that . You have to get well before you can go home . " The women who had been discussing Rosa stared at Virginia . They must have been very sick . For a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she knew she was not so sick as two of the patients . She had learned a good deal . She had learned that this68was not an insane asylum ; it was a mental hospital . The ladies had not lost their minds ; they had had nervous breakdowns . This last was a surprise . You had thought only the wealthy and the very brilliant had nervous breakdowns . It was impossible to imagine that any of these ladies had ever been either . She felt shy in her glasses , as if the other women could see her for the first time now . Some of them looked at her but most of them paid no attention . A lady who was shovingthe polisher gave her a touch-me-if-you-dare look and Virginia said , " You are welcome to it . " The lady was too far from her to hear , but your glasses made you feel as if she was in your lap . It was like looking through binoculars . You were sickeningly reminded of drawings you had seen in a large book on the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who had a nervous breakdown and after she had finished the book she thought it might be a good idea to read up on the subject . She really had n't thought of this herself . Someone had said how in the world would you know anything about such a subject and did you do an awful lot of research . So after the book was finished she did some research . There really was no time before . She read maybe a dozen books on the subject and she decided that a thirteenth opinion might get by . Her book was not published but the reason given was the bad length and , as writers always believe what is pleasant to believe , she believed that the length of her breakdown book was the only thing bad about it . Her hero 's breakdown was artistic and private . He did not go to an institution . Never having been inside of that sort of place Virginia felt she could not invent such a background . So her man went about his business and had6ghis breakdown inside of himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive person than he had been before . It was a romantic book . She knew this when she was writing it . What she did not know until she came to Juniper Hill was that the dozen scholarly volumes she had read on the subject were also very romantic . Looking at the ladies of Ward Three she was again conscious of the terrible odor that always clung to the place . The room was very clean and so the smell must come from the ladies . They did not look so very dirty but on the other hand they did not look so very clean . How could they ? If there was any laundry service Virginia had never heard about it . She slid not know how long it had been since she and ( ; race had sat in the park or how long before that she had wont this old dress but she did know that the dress had not been washed since that clay in the park and that it certainly had not been clean then . She had worn it every day since then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had got when the Nose in the dining room had flicked gravy at her but the dress needed more than a sponging ; it needed throwing away . All of the ladies needed washing and ironing and something done to their hair instead of fine combing . Why fine combing ? Was Miss Hart hunting something when she ran that comb through your hair ? ... something Robert said . It was queer the way she often would remember something he had said recently . She could not remember that he had ever been here . " It 's one of the best in the country , " he had said . " I wrote home to Charles first . " Charles was their doctor at home and also their good friend . Charles had said Juniper Hill was absolutely one of the best . Also , doctors Robert hadconsulted in New York had said it was one of the best , if not the best . Slowly she looked around the room . " It may be the very best butter , " she said , " but it wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me ? " asked a lady who was standing near by . " No , " said Virginia . " I am afraid I was talking to my-self . " " A bad habit , " said the lady . " Miss Hart says you are going to P. T. with us this afternoon . " She had said this as if it were two initials . Parent Teacher Association ? But I am neither a parent nor a teacher . " Yes , " she said . I 'll have to write to Hortense . I 'll have to tell her she 's not the only one who goes to P. T. A. Only here in the East , I 'll write , we just say P. T.Hortense was always writing about the P. T. A. now that Scootie was in school . He had become a problem child . In nursery school he learned to call everyone damn stinks and now , in first grade , he complained about having to dance with the old bags from second grade when he went to dancing class . Hortense was doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on getting a certain teacher fired and a certain Bad Influence sent to another school . Well , I 'll write to her about the meeting this afternoon . I wo n't need to say just where it was held . What is Robert telling people ? That I have gone away for a little rest ? I am not getting any letters , not even from Robert . And when has he ever come to see me ? At first we went to see him regularly but after a while the doctors decided it only upset him . Then , later on of course he did n't know us and so there was no use . Progressive myopia was what you had wrong with youreyes . Was your head trouble progressive ? Head trouble . She tried to think of scientific words . There was dementia praecox , but that sounded too young . Precocious . There was manic something but you were pretty sure you were not a maniac . There was schizophrenia . That was a beautifulword , as a photograph slightly out of focus sometimes is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my book I said that was what my man had . He did n't think he was Napoleon or anything like that but he was aware of being two decided personalities , one very proper and righteous and the other something of a rake . But that ca n't be my trouble . I am just me , Virginia Stuart Cunningham . There is only one of me and it is having a hard enough time thinking for one , let alone splitting into two. 72CHAPTER F I V ENOW the gold letters stood out in a clear string of consonants . The letters , she knew , comprised her doctor 's name . Russian , perhaps . Senja , Virginia 's pupil , had explainedthat it was impossible to turn a Russian name into English . She said she had changed her name to the nearest German equivalent and then turned that into English . Of course Virginia knew this was not true . Senja lived in constant fear of being caught by the Bolsheviks . She had escaped from a Russian prison where , she told Virginia , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how her escape was managed but Virginia was certain of one thing , the name Senja used was nowhere near the one she was born to . Not long ago , well , some time during the first of the New York period , Virginia told Helene , the True Trotskyite , some of Senja 's experiences . Helene said it was all bosh , that Senja had invented the whole thing . Helene knew everything about the Revolution . From books and from being a True Trotskyite , a party that was the leftwingsplit of a leftwing split . Helene was an authority ; she had met The Old Man once and for a long time afterwardshad not washed the hand that had touched His. 73Virginia could have believed that she had never washed that hand again . Helene was an interesting person to have known ; it was nicer to have known her than to know her . Until she graduated from college she was like everyone else . She was born and reared in Evanston , and her family was the sort that sheltered its girls . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but plenty . However , Mr. Bodford , Helene 's father , had a sister who did have a great lot of money and this sister was fond of IIclene . When she died she left everything she had to IIclene and the young heiress immediatelyturned communist and fled Evanston . Now she lived in a ramshackle Village building and ran the infant split . She had joined , worked in and resigned or been fired from a half dozen parties before she organized one of her own . The True ' I'rotskyites were not to be confusedwith the Untrue . The self-appointed custodian of the creed of The Old Man had a long dark apartment that was stuffed with oriental rugs and antique furniture from her aunt 's beautifulold Evanston house ; it was also stuffed with cockroaches . In addition to the cockroaches Helene housed a varying number of True Believers . Her money , to her great disgust , was done up in a trust fund and she would not be able to get at the principal until she overthrew the government . Virginia promised herself that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pronounce it . I 'll be seeing Helene before long . Yes , once you had your glasses and got a good look at this hospital you knew it was impossible to remain here . I suppose I have been in his office many times . It has a black couch . The leather is fastened down into deepdimples . I used to lie there while he sulked somewhere behind and asked questions . Silly questions . But Robert said Charles said the doctor with the odd name was one of the best . Oh , Charles and his amiability . As far as Charles was concerned everything was just lovely . I went to see him when I was home on that visit and he said I was wonderfully well . You ca n't , of course , have a very high opinion of someone you went to school with . Dr. Thompson ? you said . Charles Thompson ? He ca n't be much good . Why , we were in kindergarten together . Robert , however , was not in kindergarten with Charles and so thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dining room . For the first time Virginia noticed that four of her table companions lacked important teeth . The Nose was anything but regal-looking now ; she was a haggle-toothed blonde whose hair was black at the roots and whose face was latticed with dirt-filled wrinkles . The Champion was n't so ugly but she had the look of a person who is n't right in the head . " Hello hello hello , " she said to Virginia . Directly across was the new one , the one named Margaret . She grinned at Virginia and asked did she remember the time Bobby caught the rabbit . Virginia knew a collection of Bobbys and sometimes , in a teasing mood , called her husband Bobby . She did not , however , know any rabbit-catcher Bobby , at any rate not in common with this brown-eyed Margaret . " Mmm , " she said . Margaret accepted the sound as an affirmative answer and continued to speak of Bobby and the rabbit until Miss Hart issued a No Talking Ladies . When the unpalatable meal was finished Margaretwaited for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are n't you ? " she whispered anxiously . " You said so . " Virginia was ashamed of the revulsion that was in her . " No , " she said as kindly as she could . " I said my sister 's name is Margaret . You and my sister have the same name . " " You said , " whimpered Margaret . " You said . " " Well , " said Virginia , " perhaps for the time being we are sisters of a sort . Yes , there is a sort of relationship . " Margaret perked up . " I knew , " she said . " I recognized you right away even though you have been dead so many years . " It was no use to talk to these women ; they were crazy . Virginia stalked back to the washroom determined never to speak to any of them again , but in a moment two or three of the ladies were asking her for cigarettes and she was doling out her last . She not only was out of cigarettes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss hart gave her a deal of toilet paper without being asked ; Miss hart gave her more than she gave the other ladies ; Miss Hart made no effort to hide her preference for V. Cunningham . This afternoon at P.T. meeting I 'll make a motion ; I 'll move that toilet paper be provided in each booth . If they will not pass the motion at least they will be forced to discuss it . " Not smoking ? " asked the nurse chummily . " I 'm out . " Miss Hart clacked her tongue and said it was a pity she had n't saved any for herself . " I 'll be taking the store orders tonight right after supper , " she said . " You can order some more then . " " That 's right , " said Virginia , as if she knew all about store orders . In the dayroom , while waiting for the P.T. meeting , 76she ran into difficulty in connection with her black bag . She had had that bag with her almost continually and never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ladies decided Virginia was a doctor . This aroused the interest of another lady and then another . The three hung on Virginia and called her Doctor and begged to know when they would be allowed to go home . When she said she was not a doctor they pointed to her little black bag . It did look like a doctor 's bag . The incident reminded her of the time she had told Gordon she was thinking of being a doctor . She did n't like to recall this because Gordon had laughed at her . He had thrown back his head and howled . She was not in the habit of comparing Gordon and Robert . Such comparisons were as wicked as they were futile . She had a vague memory that the doctor here had asked her to make such a comparison and again she felt the dimples of the leather couch . " Gordon died a very long time ago , " she had said . " He was a wonderful young man and I was very much in love with him . But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you are driving at . You can remember that you did love him but you delude yourself if you think it can continue as before . " Gordon laughed when I said I was thinking of studying medicine . Robert would not have laughed . No , Robert always takes me seriously . He would have started to figure out ways and means to send me to medical school . It would have been good if Gordon could have had a bit of Robert and Robert a bit of Gordon . Gordon might have taken her a little more seriously and Robert a little less seriously . That Paris business . She had just been talking , the way you talk about what you would do if you suddenly got a million dollars . How astounded I was when77he said it would have to be New York instead of Paris . I had forgotten my chatter about a year 's holiday . " How did you ever browbeat Robert into it ? " Mother asked when she found out that Robert was throwing up his job so that we might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's his idea , " I said . " You ought to be ashamed of yourself , Virginia , " she said . " A steady ambitious young man like Robert . What will the Cunninghams think ? " That was Mother . She was always in a dither about what the Cunninghams were going to think . " I 'm so embarrassedabout all this that I can hardly look Mrs. Cunninghamin the face , " she said later on . " When Robert worked so hard and saved up all that money and got such nice promotions and now you take him off and plan to fritter everything away . " When the Stuarts told Robert not to pay any attention to their foolish daughter , Robert said Virginia had taught him to enjoy life . They had enough money to knock off for a year and so why not ? Before she met Robert , Gordon told Virginia about him . Robert was one of Gordon 's closest friends . " There 's something so substantial about Bob Cunningham , " he said . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of fun but at the same time he 's old business . " Excuse me , my beloved Gordon , while I laugh . If Gordon 's shade could tell what she was thinking she hoped it would not mind learning that she was attracted to Robert from the start . It was n't love at first sight , as it had been in the case of her and Gordon , but it was strong attraction . So strong that she decided at once that Bob must marry a dear friend of hers , Isabel Dawson . Shearranged a double date and Bob and Isabel seemed to take to each other . Gordon , who was convinced that Isabel was a halfwit , became disturbed . Oh , Gordon , if you could only see Isabel now . Robert and Isabel went around together a good deal but when Gordon , very worried , spoke to Robert about it Robert said there was nothing serious . He said Isabel was awfully cute and a very good dancer and all but  --  but he guessed he would wait until he found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me then ? " asked Virginia once , not long after they were married . How shocked Robert had looked . " Of course not , " he said . " You were Gordon 's girl . I really was quite smitten with Isabel but I did n't dare let him know . " After flunking out of two colleges Isabel Dawson settled down to study law at a third and now was partner in a good firm in Chicago . When she came to dinner she would clap Robert on the back and say , " How 's my old flame ? " and Robert would blench for fear that she would kiss him . Which she always did . " You used not to mind , " Virginia would say after her friend had gone . " Have you forgotten how quite smitten you were ? " Manlike , Robert would say the only reason he had ever gone with Isabel was to please Virginia . " Besides , " he would add plaintively , " she 's changed . " If Isabel Dawson could turn out to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Virginia looked down at the little black bag . Thank heaven she had never mentioned her medical ambition to Robert or sure enough that bag would be brimming with scalpels right now . Inever would have stuck to my writing if he had n't kept telling me how good I was . Unaccountably she thought of a conversation she had overheard years ago in the ladies ' retiring room of the Country Club . She was in one of the booths , trying to pin a broken shoulder strap . Her slip was very plain and so she had hidden away for the repair work . She was about finished when she heard someone say Robert 's name and then hers . " Is n't Robert Cunningham here tonight with that Virginia Stuart ? " said a voice . The accent on the that advised you to remain in the booth . " He married her , " said another voice . " So her engagement to Gordon Timberlake fell through . I knew it would . " " But , darling , did n't you know ? IIe died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't it awful ? he was so good-looking . It was while you were abroad , I guess . " " I do n't know why no one ever told me . Honestly , you 'd think I did n't have any friends . I ) id Bob think he had to marry her just because he and Gordon were pals ? " " It looks like it . " " I never could see her . Of all the girls Gordon might have had . Me , for instance . Oh , sure , I admit it . My God , I ca n't believe he 's dead . I-Iow did it happen ? " " I do n't know . Some terrible disease , I guess . " " And she up and married Bob . Poor Bob . " " Well , it was a couple of years later . Maybe more . I never knew her very well . " " Heavens , neither did I. But I used to run around with Gordon 's cousin some and you should have heard her on the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong with her . " 8o " My dear , I know for a fact that she stayed all night at the Zee Zee house . " " Oh gee , I do n't believe that . I 've never liked her especially , sort of a cold fish , but ... " " Gordon 's cousin told me . " What did you do in a case like this , rush out and say you damned liar , I 'll sue you for slander ? " And besides ... " " Watch it . Someone coming . . . Darling , I just love your dress . Pink is divine on you . " " My dear , do you think so really ? Personally I think it makes me look like a hag .... " There had been no use for Virginia to try to figure out which of the numerous pink dresses it might have been . She stayed in the booth until everyone had left the dress- ing room . It was a large party and pink was popular just then . If she had been putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl 's voice some time or other and then polished her off beautifully . However , she never had the least idea who the person might have been . Per- haps what burned her up most was that Zee Zee was a very second-rate fraternity . If Gordon 's cousin , a little rat who had tried her level best to catch him for herself , had had to invent such a story , she might at least have made it the Beta house. ii " Peee Teee , ladies ! " shouted Miss Hart . The call shook Virginia from a pleasant dream in which she was telling off a girl in a pink evening dress . Hurry , hurry . She ran over to the nurse who was surrounded by clamoring ladies . Miss Hart clapped her hands . She could make more8inoise with her voice than with her hands , but when she was especially excited she clapped . " Quiet , ladies , " she roared . Then she read from a paper and said that only those whose names she had read were to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frantic howl and her assistant , Miss Forderly or some such name , came slapping her white shoes on the linoleum . Virginia , cautious when wearing her glasses , stepped to one side . Brown-eyed Margaret was shrieking that her mother had said she could go anywhere her big sister went , but Miss Forderly dragged her off and soon the honored ladies filed into the corridor . They went past the dining room and the doctor 's office to a door that led to the stair-well . Was this Petey a trick , a new way to get them up to that electrical place ? But you always had an empty stomach for that , and it was always in the morning . When they said you were not to take breakfast it meant you were to go for shock . That is a professional phrase . Shock treatment . Something rather new in the treatment of mental illness . You see I know a great deal about these things when I set my mind to it . Instead of going up they went down and then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were going out of the hospital for the meeting . I should have worn a hat . I look a mess . But so do the others look a mess . But what will the real people think of us ? Will they take our votes seriously ? Off on the horizon were hills and between the hospital and the hills were fields and woods . This was country . There was no sign of the city anywhere . Of course Virginia had often looked from the narrow windows , but without her glasses the view might have been anything from Times82Square to the Skokie marshes . Often of an afternoon the ladies were allowed to go out to their cage but the cage gave onto a sort of park that was surrounded by high red buildings . How had they spirited you out of town ? Did Robert know ? Those letters . Yes , he had known . There was n't much time for admiring the landscape . Miss Hart turned to the left and soon they were back among the red cliffs . " They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her marching partner . " Hundreds , " said her partner . They turned again and went into a one-story building that had no cages . Just inside the door they were met by a gray-haired woman who was wearing a black bloomer suit , long black cotton stockings and black gym shoes . She looked like a physical education teacher of the Twentiesand her hair was cut in what in the Twenties would have been considered a smart boyish bob . There were several other groups of ladies in this foyer and several other nurses . " Well , " said Bloomers to Miss Hart , " I thought you were n't coming . " Miss Hart grunted and then she and the other nurses went away and Bloomers took the ladies into a large gymnasium . The floor was marked with black painted lines and there were basketball hoops at either end and over to one side was a volleyball net . " Fall in , " said Bloomers . " Fall in what ? " gasped Virginia 's partner . " Line , I imagine , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands for Physical Training . But this was a letdownwhen you had thought you were going to a meeting where you would make a radical motion and get even with Hortense and her old P.T.A.83 Virginia had managed to avoid most of the physical training offered in high school and college . She had had an old-fashioned doctor . He wore a morning coat and a white carnation and he thought exercise , beyond strolling in the park , unthinkable for young ladies . Charles Thomp- son would have had you going out for football , but Charles was still in school himself in those days and had n't a word to say . Oh , Charles , even then , had words to say , but no M.I. to back them up . Anyhow , the old doctor wrote out papers to demand that you be excused from physical training . You had to take the swimming examination , though . In order to graduate 11 on ' college you had to swim the length and breadth of the pool  --  just what this had to do with a degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . She used a breast stroke part of the time and part of the time a sideways version of the dog paddle . She kept her head high out of the water and the swimming instructor moaned while she took her examination . But he had to pass her . The rule simply stated that you had to swim the length and breadth of the pool without stop- ping . It said absolutely nothing about the style to be employed . " It 's a crime , that 's what it is , " said the instruc- tor when he checked Virginia 's card . But at least she had passed her own examination . A friend of hers had taken the test seven times , each time under a different name and bathing cap . You had to get a date for her in return . Virginia had tried to get a date for this professional test- passer but finally had decided it would be easier to take the test herself . " Ten  --  shun ! " said Bloomers snappily . Virginia stuck her stomach out . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital . She was so 84 engrossed in working this out that she missed the commandto squat and was spoken to personally by Bloomers . They squatted , hands on hips , ho ; they stood up , hands outstretched , ho ; they leaned over and touched the floor without bending their knees , ho ho , and more or less copied what Bloomers was doing . Bloomers seemed to be having a grand time . The old girl was nimble and expected the ladies to go through the tricks quickly . Virginia wished she had Senja 's nerve . One summer Senja got it into her head that she must learn to swim . She had had a dream about being chased into Lake Michigan by the Bolsheviks and so she and Virginia went to take swimming lessons from a woman who once had been champion at that horrid stroke , the Australian Crawl . The teacher probably knew no other stroke because she was determined that her pupils should master the crawl . She lined them up at the shallow end and had them wave their arms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the pool and kick their legs . Senja endured this until the middle of the second lesson . That was when the teacher told them to put their heads under the water . " Ya ole beetch , " screamed Senja then . " Ya ga ta hall " Virginia was Senja 's language teacher for over two years . By the end of the second year Senja could make herself fairly well understood , which was a shame inasmuch as her vocabulary contained much that Virginia had never taught her . You had to be grateful for the few times when Senja had failed to make herself clear , though . Virginia would never forget the time her Russian pupil told a floorwalker he was a bastard . " L000k , ya buster , " she said to him . When her volatile attention was captured by a display on a nearby counter the floorman giggled to85Virginia that it had been a long time since anyone had called him Buster . " At first I thought she was sore , but then when she called me Buster . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was impossible to make much headway with Senja after that . Senja used the floorman as an example of how you have to treat the lower classes . Properly kicked around , she said , they are willing and obliging . Now Bloomers had had enough . During the last exercise her enthusiasm had sounded mechanical . Now she said wearily that they would skate or play volleyball . They could choose . " If you choose to skate , remember to stay on this side of the gym . All right , Volleyball Ladies . " Not being a volleyball lady Virginia stayed with the skaters . They went to a large box and hauled out roller skates . You had to sit on the floor to put your skates on and as there was only one key the volleyball game was well under way before the first skater wobbled out to the rink . Virginia did not wobble ; she was an expert . She had not been on skates since she was fourteen , but she did not fall down . She was the only skating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well , " said Bloomers when P.T. was over . The teacher looked bushed and Virginia was sorry for her . Back in the Twenties she had probably taught at a good school and now in her old age she was driven to teaching crazy ladies . " I skated a lot when I was a child , " said Virginia . " One never forgets , " said Bloomers . " No , " said Virginia . " Like riding a bicycle . " This isthe first time in my whole life that I have had a chance to say this first . " That 's right , " said Bloomers . " It is a good deal like riding a bicycle , that is , the sense of balance .... " Miss Hart and the other nurses had cone . " Well , Virginia , " said Miss Hart , " how did it go ? " " I 'll be stiff tomorrow , I expect , " said Virginia . " Nothing like exercise , " said Miss Hart happily . Then she changed her expression . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered around their nurse . The treat was over . The smell of Ward Three , after you had been out in the open , was overpowering . When they stepped into the dayroom Virginia identified the smell . Paraldehyde . One romantic book she read while doing research into mental ailments stated that the stench of paraldehyde has vanished from our mental institutions . I remember I wondered what paraldehyde was and I looked it up and it said hypnotic , a hypnotic . So it is paraldehyde and not formaldehyde . Grace knew a lot , but she did not know that . I have worked it out for myself from the sound and from the stench and also from the memory . I am therefore not so sick as Grace was when she left us . I am therefore ready to be transferred , more than that , I am ready to go home . What is the matter with that doctor who is one of the best ? Months since I saw the man . " Miss Hart , " she said , after she had given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said yes , she would like some more cigarettes , " when am I going to see my doctor again ? " " Would n't you like to order some candy too ? You have a five-dollar credit at the store , " said the nurse . " Have you heard the news ? There 's going to be a movie tomorrow night and you 're on the list . " " I never will be missed . " " What ? " " Oh , I was just thinking about that Gilbert and Sullivan thing about having him on the list and so on . " " Say , I 'd forgotten that show , " said Miss Hart . " HitchyKoo . My goodness , I was just a child then , of course . " " Of course , " said Virginia . " You think it wo n't be long before I get to see my doctor again ? " " Are n't you feeling well ? It 's probably just from Petey . " " There are some things I want to ask him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw him just the day before yesterday , you know . " Another patient pushed up to Miss Hart to give a store order . Virginia went off to a corner and sat down . She tried to think , but the gray chiffon wound closer. ivBy noon the next day the word about the movie had got around , and some of the ladies whom Virginia had considered hopeless spoke sensibly about the coming adventure . Virginia and a woman who appeared to know nothing at all were the only ones who showed no enthusiasm , but when Virginia thought about a movie she thought about going with Robert . She never went without him . It developed , when the time eventually came , that not everyone was invited . More ladies were honored than had been included in the P.T. expedition , but fifteen or so were dosed up with paraldehyde and put to bed . Virginiawould not have minded going to bed but it was something , of course , to get out of the paraldehyde . The theater-bent marched away . No slicking up had been indulged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given on the hospital grounds . The campus . They went to a building near the gymnasium . It was a pleasant evening . The sun was nearing the horizon and the gold-red light made the distant hills pretty .. . . The theater was a great hall that had a stage at one end . There were many rows of folding chairs and nurses were stationed at intervals to direct traffic . When the women were seated only half of the hall was filled . Then came men . Virginia had got used to knowing that many women were in this hospital but she had not thought about it having men patients . The long lines of shuffling men made her throat hurt ; she wondered if Don Jackson might be among them . She had never thought before about what institution he was in ; it could be this one , could n't it ? I doubt if I would recognize him . Perhaps the reason the men roused her pity even more than the women did was that they did not look nearly so bad . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of their dull way of dressing . When they lose their minds they look less lost than women . They looked like ordinary men , not spruce , but most of them could have got by in a crowd . Not a woman in the audiencecould have got by in any crowd other than the one she was in now . A woman without a pocketbook or a compact or a pair of gloves or a hat or even a handkerchief is a lost soul . Miss Hart had seen to it that her charges had stowed away their bags and boxes before coming to the theater and apparently the other nurses had taken thesame precaution . The ladies had nothing to do with them- selves . No hats to take off , no nice hair-dos to pat , no handkerchiefs to flutter .... It was odd to be in a room with a thousand or more insane persons . The audience was far quieter than the usual audience of a thousand normal people . When the room was darkened the picture began . Vir- ginia did not bother to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the audience laughed frequently and sometimes there was applause . In case a nurse might be watching for her reaction Virginia laughed when the others laughed and she clapped when the others clapped . The faces on the screen were familiar but she could not think of the actors ' names . hardly an abnormal state for me , I never could remember their names . Now and then someone would stand up and shout but otherwise there was no more audience disturbance than you would find in any theater of this size . Less , really . There was no popcorn eating and no cellophane rattling ; there was no running back and forth to the rest rooms and no wandering about for better seats . The picture was short . The lights were turned on and the nurses began to guide their charges out of the room . The show was over . The men remained seated while the ladies filed out . The sun had set . It was night . Virginia breathed deeply . This was the first time she had been outside at night in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and saw that there were stars , " Was n't it a cute show ? " said Miss Fredericks when they were back in the washroom . Miss Hart had vanished somewhere along the line and of course , even so , she had put in more time tonight than she was supposed to . Ordinary nights she went off duty at seven , after the ladies were in bed . But tonight Miss Fredericks , the night head nurse , had to put them to bed . " Was n't it a scream , ladies ? " And the stars had been shining for the first time since last February . You can go along for weeks maybe months without thinking about the stars . They are there , on clear nights , and you can look at them if you want to . Sometimesyou may notice them and say there is the Big Dipper . You may , if you are not in a hurry , hunt for the Pleiades ; but you do not think much about the stars . They are always there . Look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an illness that caused you to be shut up like a criminal . They took the night away from you then . They drugged you and put you to bed before dark . But inadvertently , in connection with giving you a movie , they had also given you a glimpse of genuine stars . For perhaps two minutes you walked under the star-pierced sky . " And how did you like the show , Virginia ? " asked Miss Fredericks . Ordinarily this nurse had very little truck with the ladies . She was the one who got them started of a morning , but of a morning she was not affable or willing to delay the routine for the sake of a little conversation . " Fine , thank you . " " I thought it was terribly cute , " said Miss Fredericks . " Medication , ladies ! " Virginia went with the other Medication Ladies and drank her share of the hypnotic that made them smell like badly tended lions and then she went to her dormitory . She was the only one of her dormitory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roommates lay sleeping on their cots. 91She turned down the covers of her cot and got into bed . You can bury your aching throat in the flat pillow and you can stuff the rough sheet into your mouth . You can beat your fists on the hard mattress and none of this will disturb the paraldehyde sleepers . And even as you weep you know it will be only a few minutes before you will sink into the paraldehyde emptiness . WHEN she saw Miss Hart coming , Virginia took the polisher from Gladys . Gladys was one of the three who thought Virginia the doctor ; this had been useful in the matter of the polisher . " Certainly , Doctor , " said Gladys . Virginia was hard at work when Miss Hart reached her . " But not today , " said Miss Hart . " Gladys , you take the polisher . Virginia , have you forgotten what day it is ? " Of course Virginia had forgotten . She had no idea what day of the week it was , what week of the month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain this to the nurse . " It is n't so much a matter of forgetting as it is of not knowing . When your memory is all tied up and separated from the rest of you , you do n't forget . In order to forget you have first to remember , do n't you , even though briefly ? " " Do n't give me the fancy talk , " laughed Miss Hart . She took Virginia by the hand . " We better get ready now . I might not have the time later on . " Virginia understood how that could be . Time was differenthere ; sometimes it was long and sometimes it was short and sometimes  --  this was disconcerting  --  it was not at all . In real life you had been able to count on time ; you might feel you had n't enough of it , but it was always there , nicely parceled out in seconds and minutes and93hours . Each day had twenty-four hours and you were able to depend on tomorrow . As with the stars it was something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world of Juniper Hill , a day might consist of weeks , of hours , of a minute , or , frighteningly , of not even a second . The nurse led her to a door she had never seen before . Naturally . The door was not there before . Just as the washroom was at one end of the corridor one day and at the other end the next day . Entirely new doors were created in order to insure perpetual confusion . You fancied them saying , Look , the ladies are getting on to the Ward ; last night Virginia found the washroom withouthalf trying ; time for change , gentlemen . Miss Hart unlocked the new door  --  they were careful always to have the same lock . The new door opened into a small room that was lined with dresses and cupboards . In the center of the room was an ironing board . I can never iron all those dresses . I simply can not do it . I am going to have to explain to this woman what a favor is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At least not for me , nurse . " What do you want to wear today ? " asked Miss Hart . Virginia stared at the racks . She recognized several of the garments . Of course they were not really her own clothes ; the hospital had made duplicates to fool her . " It does n't make any difference , " she said . Would all this be reported in the chart ? Watch what you say . " It 's cooler today . " The nurse made her mouth look profound . " I think the gray suit . " " It 's awfully tight , " said Virginia . " A friend gave it to me and she 's only a twelve . I always meant to have it altered . " Miss Hart had taken the suit from its hanger . As in the real world , the person offering the choice had already madethe decision . Virginia took off her dress and the nurse put the skirt on her and zipped it up so quickly that it closed all the way . Virginia had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ! The white-silk blouse , also a gift , was too large now and the jacket  --  you could have been pregnant in it . " There , " said Miss Hart . " That 's just dandy . Now hand me your comb . " This reminded Virginia that the black bag must be discarded . She told Miss Hart about the ladies who were accusing her of being a doctor and Miss Hart shook her head and said what next . " Never a dull moment , " she said . She must have had a peculiar life before coming to Juniper where all moments were insufferably dull . " You might put the things you have to have every day in that candy box you would n't let me throw out . No sense in lugging that bag around anyhow . Good thing you made me save the box . " " Yes , " said Virginia , although she remembered noth. ing about a candy box . " I thought it might come in handy . " When the nurse was shuffling around in the bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon Robert 's letters . Virginia failed to restrain a cry , but the nurse said gently , really gently , that the letters would be safe in the bag . " Anyhow , it 's better to see him than the letters , is n't it ? " It was an unnecessary jab for which the gentleness had not prepared you . Virginia turned her head to hide her tears . To keep from going to pieces she thought of names to call the nurse . " There , " said Miss Hart , the pig of a dog . " Where is the rouge ? A little rouge and then . . . " She rubbed the94 - 95small puff on Virginia 's cheeks and then stepped off a way to inspect her creation . " You look swell , " she said . " Just swell . " Then she told Virginia to go back to the dayroom and that seemed to be that . Virginia sat in the dayroom and waited for something to happen and after a while Miss Hart called Dinner Ladies . Virginia wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the others . Exceptthat she lacked hat and bag and gloves , she was dressed for the street . " Come on , Virginia . Do n't keep the ladies waiting . " All dressed up and nowhere to go . As they passed the gold-lettered door she thought perhaps that was where she was going , but Miss I ( art gave her a little push toward the dining room . The Champion immediately noticed the change in costume . She broke into her series of hellos . " Well , where do you think you are going ? " she asked . She had bright eyes and appeared to be a little too alert . " I do n't know , " said Virginia . Nothing too alert about me . No little bright eyes here . The Champion nodded . " Staff , " she said . " They always fix you up for Staff . They had me wear my good green dress that I paid nineteen dollars for reduced from fortysevenfifty , but it did n't do any good . " " This suit cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend ofmine bought it and then decided it did n't become her . " " You had that suit on the day Bobby caught the rabbit , " said Margaret . " I remember it like it was yesterday . " " No talking , ladies , " bawled Miss Hart . Perhaps it was the suit . The Nose , although she stirred her plate of food as usual , changed her routine . When she96had finished blending the mixture she threw it on the floor . Miss Hart came running . " Oh , you bad girl , Hazel , " she said , " you bad , bad girl . Just for that you ca n't have any dessert . " The Nose began to sob bitterly . When dessert came Virginia clung to her little pan and the Champion could not get it away from her . " No , not today , " said Virginia . Then she slid the pan over to the Nose . " There . Stop crying . " The Nose stopped the ghastly racket . She picked up the pan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including the devoted Margaret , announced that Virginia was responsible . Again Miss Hart came running . " A dozen times , Virginia , I 've told you not to have anything to do with Hazel . " " I 'll clean it up , " said Virginia . " I 'm so sorry . " " You 'll do nothing of the sort . Hazel , any more tricks out of you and you 'll go back to pack as sure as you 're born . " While the nurse wiped up the mess there was angelic silence , but as soon as Miss Hart had gone to another part of the room the Nose whirled around and slapped Virginia'sface . This was too much for Margaret . She leapt from her chair and came round the table to defend her temporary sister . Food , ladies and chairs flashed helter-skelter past Virginia , but after a few moments Miss Hart and her assistant quelled the riot . The ladies , said Miss Hart , would all be sent to pack if they did not watch out . Virginia realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It did not mean that you would be sent to pack your suitcase ; it meant you would be sent97packing . I must make a note of this so that if I sometime have occasion for an Eastern person to tell someone off I will get the idiom right . Sir , if you do not cease to pay your disgusting attentions to my daughter , I shall find it necessary to send you to pack . For books issued in the Middle West you would almost have to make a note : Algy was not staying at the Sherwoods ' residence . The old man meant he would be sent packing .... How would the old man manage this ? Call in the police ? How would Miss Hart manage to send fifty ladies packing ? Did she mean she would chase them through the hall with a whip ? But we use these idiomatic phrases carelessly . She does n't know what she means , except that she is angry . Back in the dayroomn Virginia decided that her change of clothing represented Dressing Therapy . I ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This would have been rather amusing if you had had a good stiff drink . Of paraldehyde . The Juniper Cocktail , as we call it , we gay ladies of Juniper Hill . A martini , please , we more sophisticated ones say . And where , nurse , is the olive ? She went to one of the windows and looked out . The view from this side was pleasant , so very pleasant that she fancied she saw Robert below on the sidewalk . Better look out of the other side or you will start imagining all sorts of things and that is bad for a crazy woman ... . " Virginia , " called Miss Hart . " He 's here . " " Is he ? " The nurse had said you would see the doctor next week and although you had thought this was still this week you were , as usual , mistaken . She went to the nurse and the door was unlocked and the nurse pushed it open and there was Robert . Of course it was not Robert , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hello , " said the man . " Hello , " said Virginia . " Right on the dot , as usual , " said Miss Hart . " But we 've been ready a long time , have n't we , Virginia ? " " Oh , yes , " said Virginia . She smiled to think they expected to fool her with so crude a joke . " Well , go along , you two , " said Miss Hart . " Do n't you eat so much that you wo n't touch your supper , like last time . . . . " Time . Is it more sensible to alter time to suit your convenience than to alter your convenience to suit time ? Why do n't people on the outside discover that time is a slave to be shortened or lengthened , to be banished or borne , to be known or ignored , like last time ? " Mr. Cunningham , do n't let her stuff herself . " " I wo n't , " said the man . He sounded like Robert , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at the man with admiration . The creation demanded certain tribute . " You have your glasses , " he said . " That 's good . " He led her to a small alcove that had been set into the hall since dinner time . In the alcove were a few chairs , a settee and a replica of the Cunninghams ' picnic hamper . On the hamper was a fair copy of the steamer rug Robert had bought in Scotland . " Do you want to sit down a minute ? " the man asked . " All right , " she said . Her knees were shaking . They sat on the settee and she was careful not to gettoo close to him . He nodded toward the gold-lettered door . " I just now saw Kik for a few minutes , " he said . " Yes ? " she said politely . " He says you are so much better . " " Does he ? " " He says it wo n't be much longer .... I hope you did n't eat much lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very attractive . She could not help being interested and anyway it could do no harm to talk to the man . " What did you bring ? " she asked . " You 'll see . Do you feel like going now ? You are n't shaky ? " " Of course not , " she said . " I 'm glad you are wearing your suit , " he said . " It 's cooler today . " " It 's not mine , " she said . " You look better in it than Alice ever did , " he said . How carefully they had coached him ! " Thank you , " she said . " They have made it larger in some way . It 's much too large for me . " " Well . . . " He cleared his throat . " Well , we better be getting along . The days are shorter now and the sun is n't very warm after three o'clock . " There was something the matter with his throat . He coughed . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned toward the outer door . " This door is n't locked . " " That 's funny . It usually is . They are very careful about doors . " " How did you know ? " " Did you enjoy the movie ? " " Dr. Kik told me , " he said . At least he was frank about the source of his information . " Kik ? " Could all of those letters shrink into one ridiculouslittle syllable ? " I did n't see him there . " They walked along and when they came to the turn fortoothe gynasium they went the other way . " Is it all right to do this ? " she asked . " Absolutely , " he said . " We 're just going to the same place . " " Oh , " she said . She was beginning to think maybe he was Robert . Surely an actor , even a fine actor , would n't have been able to make his throat go bad on account of the too-large suit . She did not understand why Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouded voice had somehow shaken her belief in the impostor . " The stars were wonderful last night , " she said . " It rained in town , " he said . " It did ? It was clear as a bell here . I looked at the stars on the way home from the movie . " " The movie was night before last , darling . " " Was it ? " " Yes . I noticed the stars night before last . " " Then I have lost another day , " she said . " I do n't suppose I 'll ever find it . " He was holding her hand the way he had always done , her fingers laced through his . " It does n't make any difference , " he said . " In a hospital all days are alike and the less you think about them the better . This afternoon is all we care about now . " " Are you really Robert ? " she said . " I have to be sure , you know . " He squeezed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not answer her question and even odder that his not answering banished her last doubt . " Do n't mind me , " she said . " I say things without meaninganything . " " Who does n't ? " he said . He had brought her to a tinytotpark that was screened from the hospital buildings by tall thick hedges that were yellow and red with fall . " Well , here we are . And no one else . That 's the advantage of my coming on a week day . On a Sunday this place would be jammed . " There were three brick fireplaces , some refuse baskets and several benches . Robert spread the steamer rug on the ground . He opened the hamper and took out a beautiful little roast chicken . " Bigger than last time , " he said . It was one of those glazed birds you see in delicatessens . They never look real and so are suitable for an unreal time . Robert is real , but I and the time are dreams . " Tomatoes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a thermos of coffee . I remembered the salt this time . " It was a feast . tt was like long ago . But we never took bought roast chicken on those picnics of long ago . " You should n't have spent so much money , Robert . " " I 've got plenty . " " How much does it cost to keep me here ? " " Not much , " he said . He looked away from her . " How much ? " Why did he always think he could avoid telling her how much ? " It 's based on my salary and so it ca n't be much , " he said . " Do n't give it a second thought . " I shall give it a second and a third thought later on but now . . . " There is nothing like a good meal , " she said . " I do n't mean that the food here is n't all right , " she added when she noticed the distress in his eyes , " but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . He stood up . " I think we had better sit on a bench now . I 'll put the rug around you . You must n't catch a cold . " " I would n't mind having a cold , double pneumonia102or something I could understand . You talk about second thoughts . I have no first thoughts . What 's the matter with me ? Is it a brain tumor ? " " God , no , " he said . " Whatever made you think of that ? " " I do n't know , " she said . " I just now thought of it . " " It 's a nervous breakdown , " he said . " That does n't sound bad , does it ? " " It takes time , that 's all . " " What do they do for it besides take time ? " " Well , there are those shock treatments . The electrical ones are rather new , you know . Charles writes that he has had several of his patients take them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He thinks it 's the answer . " " Charles and his thinking . He 's always thinking . I wish he would take a shock treatment himself . That would stop him for a while . . . . How many have I had ? " " I do n't know exactly . A dozen or so , I think . " " Are they going to give me more ? " " Kik says he will see . " " Is that really the way to pronounce his name ? " " It 's the nearest I can come to it , " said Robert . " He sort of spits and gargles around but it boils down to being something like Kik . " " How much longer is it going to be ? " " He ca n't say . We have to be very patient , darling . It is n't the sort of thing that can be hurried . " " I want to hurry it . I want to leave now , this afternoon . I 'll get well right away if I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " we have to do what the doctors say . But it wo n't be long . You just do n't think about it . You just sort of vegetate and take things easy . " Thinking about the hours she spent laboriously pulling and shoving the polisher she looked down at the fringe of103the steamer rug . " Have you ever been in our dayroom ? " she asked . " No , " he said . " They do n't let visitors in there . Why ? " She smiled . " Oh , nothing , " she said . " I was just wonder-ing. " iiDid I imagine the picnic with him ? I remember it clearly but sometimes you remember a dream clearly . I remember what we had to eat and how good everything tasted . If it was a dream it was the first dream in which I ever ate and got full . I remember how he tucked the rug around me , how he held my hand . . . . But I no longer can be sure of things .

But could you dream somethingentirely foreign to your experience ? I have read twelve books about mental hospitals but Juniper Hill , real or dreamed , never appeared in those works . Juniper Hill , one of the best in the country if not the best . Preserve me from the worst . People used to say I had an imagination . Oh , Gin , what an imagination you have .

While the nurse was fussing around about putting the gray suit away she forgot about Virginia 's medication and Virginia did not remind her . So now she lay awake . Or , in her dream , she thought herself awake . A simple test is to go to the bathroom . I wo n't think about where it is . If I am at home it will be the adjoining room . Chancing a genuine or an imaginary case of athlete 's foot she padded barefoot down the hall . The corridors were never without some light but after the ladies had retired the lights were dimmed . Near the office door Miss Fredericks and another night nurse stood talking . They did not see Virginia . She went into the washroom and got a drink of water . There was a fountain in the hall but near the nurses . She drank from cupped hands and then went back to the dormitory . She had counted the door-104 105ways and so knew that her dormitory was the fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good Morning Ladies . It was a chilly morning . If I am dreaming I wish I would wake up enough to get another cover . It might have been the next day or the same day or the next week or the week after that ; she might have had another picnic with Robert in the interval . You never knew afterwards . But one day was a special day . It was not Thursday or yesterday or tomorrow or anything like that ; it was a special day , as if you were crossing the Equator . At first when Miss hart started going on about what day it was Virginia thought Robert was coming . " Well , Virginia , " said Miss Hart , " this is your RedLetterDay . " A red-letter day is a holiday and maybe Robert can come an extra time on a holiday . " Am I going to wear my gray suit ? " " Well , " said Miss Hart . " No , I do n't think so . You wo n't be out of the building . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They dress so much better there . " " Do they ? " Virginia asked this for the sake of conversation , not because she doubted that they would not dress better anywhere . " Yes . They are quite classy in One . Quite the finishing school . " The nurse gave a laugh that sounded malicious . " One ? You mean Ward One ? " " Why , yes . Did n't Miss Fredericks tell you ? You 're being transferred to One . " Virginia began to tremble . " Oh , " she said . " Does my husband know ? Will he be able to find me ? " " Sure . Dr. Kik told him . We 're all so happy for you , Virginia . " " It 's a promotion then . " " I 'll say . We do n't often have anyone skip Two , but Dr. Kik gave the order . You 're lucky to have a doctor who takes such a personal interest in you .

" I wonder what happens to the ones he is n't especially interested in . " Miss Hart looked at her . She seemed about to say something out of character . But then she put on her R.N. look and said they must get ready . " There is no cut-anddriedrule about patients having to go to One before they are released . . . uh , I mean , before they go home . I mean , you can go from any of the wards . But they usually go from One . It 's like a convalescent home . " " I 'm not ready for it , " Virginia heard herself say . " And you know it , Miss Hart . " They were in the cupboard room now . " I could go home , but I am not well enough for One . " The nurse stopped packing Virginia 's things for a momentbut then she patted a dress down into the large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose you 've heard some of the ladies talking . . . . " Yes . " I ca n't remember what they said but there is something terrible about Ward One . " You know better than to pay any attention to them . They 're sick . Only one or two of them have ever been inside of Ward One . " 1o6 " You mean some of them go there and then come back ? " " Practically everyone goes home from Ward One , " said Miss Hart as if reading from a book . " You are not sent to Ward One unless you are practically ready to go home . That is understood . " She was using the loud firm voice you always use when you are not sure of what you are saying . " That 's good , " said Virginia . " I tell you what , " said Miss Hart when they were crossing the dayroom . " You do everything Miss Davis says . Do n't think about it , just do it . You 'll get along all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia knew what was terrible about Ward One . Miss Davis . " Is she the head nurse ? " " And how , " muttered Miss Hart . And then she raised her voice . The nurses had a way of acting as if the patients were unable to hear anything that was not shouted . Frequentlythey said things in normal voices that the ladies were not supposed to hear ; if they had not been nurses you would have said they frequently talked to themselves . " A most competent and efficient person , Miss Davis , " announced Miss Hart . " One of the finest nurses in the country , if not the finest . " Virginia and a student nurse , a very young person in blue-and-white stripes and a white apron without a bib , went down the hall . They went past the dining-room door , past the doctor 's door , past Robert 's door . They turned corners and finally the student unlocked a door that said , in black letters , Ward One . The corridor inside of the door was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the office where art all white nurse , a very handsome woman who was around thirty , was sitting at a desk . The woman looked at the student and frowned , aszo8if it made her ill to see the student ; she then looked at Virginia and scowled . " V. Cunningham from Three ? " " Yes , Miss Davis , " said the student . Miss Davis lifted her head even higher . " Miss Gold ! " she shouted . There was the sound of a nurse coming fast . This was one sound Juniper Hill had in common with an ordinary hospital . A nurse coming fast always sounds the same . It was a sound Virginia connected with Gordon . Once in a sailboat a sudden change in the wind brought that sound and she thought she smelled disinfectant . " Miss Gold , " said Miss Davis to the nurse who had just come into the office , " this is the new patient from Three . Dr. Kik 's patient . " Virginia looked at Miss Gold . Then she looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know why she should be scared . I 'm the one . " Show her to her room , Miss Gold . That will be all . You will wait in your room until I come . " The head nurse shot this last at V. Cunningham and then she turned on the student . " Were you waiting for something ? " " Oh , no , ma'am . Will that be all , ma'am ? " " Get back to your duties , please . " Clumsily Virginia and the student pushed through the doorway together . " This way , " said Miss Gold . They passed a dozen cubicles . These doorless alcoves were called rooms . Each room had a cot and a table or a chest or some sort of washstand . A few of the rooms had what you might , in so barren a land , call homelike touches . Here was a photograph and there a crucifix . " This is your room , " said Miss Gold when they came to the end of the hall. 109There was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gritty to walk upon . There was a cot and there was a table . The cot was the sort they had in Three , an iron army cot , but it was made up with far more arithmetical exactness than they had managed in Three . There was no wrinkle or lump in the gray blanket that served as counterpane . The room was large enough to turn around in . You would n't have thought so , but Miss Gold turned around . " You just wait here until Miss Davis comes , " she said . " Shall I sit on the bed ? " " I do n't think I would , " said Miss Gold . " You can put your box down on the table , though . " Virginia put the candy box on the table . After Miss Gold went away she stepped to the window and looked out . The view was n't very good . Several yards from the window was a blank red-brick wall . After a while she sat down on the floor ; after more of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davis was standing in the doorway and saying to get up . " In Ward One , " said Miss Davis , " we do not lie on the floors . " " I was afraid I would muss the bed , " said Virginia . " There is a rest period every afternoon after dinner , " said Miss Davis . " There is ample time for rest . Ward One has rules that are quite different from the other wards . We take care of our own rooms , of course , and make our own beds .. . Virginia looked at the bed and sighed .. and keep things picked up . You will co-operate , of course . " " I can never make a bed look that way . " Miss Davis frowned . " You will find the ladies in One very serious and co-operative . I 'll take you to the dayroomnow . You may leave your box . Personal belongings are quite safe in One . " " There are some things I may need , " said Virginia . She picked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take it from her . This woman is a hired person . I pay her . If Robert did not pay my way here we would still be paying her through taxes . As a public servant she has no right to treat me this way and I am foolish to be afraid . Evidently Miss Davis sensed rebellion . " I trust you will be co-operative , " she said . " Ladies who are co-operative find Ward One very pleasant . " " I 'll do my best . " " Our ladies do not eat between meals . If you are afraid to leave your candy here you may give it to me and I 'll put it in the cupboard . You will have access to the cupboardsjust before and just after meals . " " This , " said Virginia , " is my pocketbook . " She smiled . " My overnight bag . The candy is quite gone , unfor-tunately . " The smile had been a mistake . The nurse 's expression curdled . Had you come upon Miss Davis outside you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not all there , not entirely normal . Look at those eyes . Miss Davis ' eyes had a look you do not mind seeing in the eyes of your cat. 111CHAPTER SEVENAFTER so long a time of dark brown Virginia was thrilled by the zinnia colors of One 's dayroom . The bright cretonnecurtains and cushions might have been hideous in real life but they were beautiful here . Of course once you stopped looking at the gay colors you saw the brown furniture and the brown linoleum ; you saw that the essentialswere the same as they were in Three . Though what is essential ? There was one other person in the large room . The scarcity of business in One was encouraging . The others must have gone home . Just think , they come and go so fast that when I arrived at One there was only one other patient . The thought was bracing . " I am Virginia Cunningham , " she said to the other patient . " I 've just come . " The woman was perhaps forty but neither fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know a second time . Her hair and face were about the same color and this neutral shade was repeated in her dress . She looked at Virginia , at first without interest , but then her eyes took on warmth . " I see you have a box of candy , " she said graciously . " I 'm sorry , " said Virginia , " but it 's empty . I mean , there is no candy . I carry my powder and things in it . " 112The warmth changed to suspicion . " Where did you come from ? " Out of the nowhere into the here . " Three . " " No , " said the dun-colored woman , " one does not come from Three . I myself was in Two less than a week but of course I have money . " " That must be convenient , " said Virginia . She looked around the room and saw that there was a piano . " I did n't notice the piano before . How nice . " " It is not played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ward . " " Oh . Well , I play a little . " " Enough to call yourself a pianist ? " " No . " " Then you will not get permission . There is no use to ask . The standards in One are very high . I would n't be here this morning if I did n't have a slight cold . As a rule I am working . " " Of course . " " It 's menial work . They do n't seem to understand that I 'm not the type they usually get . My husband , Mr. Grier , is very wealthy . I was in a number of exclusive hospitals before I came here . All restricted , of course . I came here at the insistence of a very expensive doctor . My husband , Mr. Grier , is very wealthy . I have more jewels than I can possibly wear . " " How annoying , " said Virginia . " You , of course , are a charity patient . " " No . It so happens that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What the hell . If you have to be here why not try to get a kick out of it ? " I too have many jewels . The diamonds simply weigh me down . " " I have the Hope diamond . " 113 " I have the Hopeless Emerald . It carries the CunninghamCurse . You 've probably read of it . " " Mr. Grier , my husband , considered buying it , but it has a flaw . You can not put an imperfect stone on the most beautiful hands in the world . " Mrs. Grier held up her hands . They were not bad hands ; each had four fingers and a thumb . " It is a responsibility . Often I wish I had just ordinary hands , like yours . " This was n't much fun , really . " When you said you are n't here as a rule did you mean there are other patients in the ward ? " " Thousands , " said Mrs. Grier , " and all of the lower classes . Mr. Grier . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my husband , was saying the last time he was here that he has never seen so many of the lower classes . " " If you look at it from a certain viewpoint you might find it very interesting . " " I would not . " " I mean the you one substitutes for one , the general you . " " General who ? " " Oh  --  Pershing . " " A cousin of mine , " said Mrs. Grier . " One of the minor branches of the family . " This went on for some time . Virginia suspected that Mrs. Grier knew she was talking nonsense , but there was no sense to discuss . They had been comparing jewels and relatives for about an hour when the other ladies came . There were dozens . Fifty or sixty . Virginia studied them as they entered the dayroom . Taken as a group they appeared to be normal women. 114Most of the newcomers were under middle age and although Virginia tried to be critical when she scrutinized them they seemed distressingly well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only stupid ladies of Ward One . And it had been evident that Mrs. Grier was reluctant to accept her . Yes , I do n't look as well as she does . I need a permanent , a manicure and a good hot bath . The ladies gathered into little groups and talked . None of them paid any attention to Virginia and Mrs. Grier . So Virginia got up and went away from Mrs. Grier . She might have been invisible , except that one or two ladies eyed her candy box . Miss Gold came to the door . " Dinner , ladies , " she said . The ladies strolled out of the dayroom and down the hall ; there was no forming in line , no waiting for silence . In the dining room Virginia asked Miss Gold where she should sit and Miss Gold said anywhere . But it was some time before the new patient could discover a place that was not reserved and eventually she ended up beside Mrs. Grier . The food was somewhat reminiscent of real food . You had meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a salad . The plates were not metal and you could have your coffee black . Four of the women at Virginia 's table carried on a sprightly conversationabout their morning 's work . " I beg your pardon , " said Virginia when there was a pause , " but did you happen to know a girl named Grace ? I do n't know her last name . She was fair and quite pretty and she was a newspaperwoman . " " Grace ? " said one of the ladies . " I do n't remember any Grace . " " There was Grace Jenks , " said another. 115 " She said pretty . " " Pardon me . " " Anyhow Grace Jenks was n't a newspaperwoman . " There was laughter . " Just what was Grace Jenks ? " " My dear , you 're asking ? " It might have been at your club back home . If Mrs. Grier had just kept her face shut you might have for- gotten where you were . n After dinner the ladies went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarettes , smoked . Vir- ginia had a full pack of cigarettes and was quite popular until they were gone . She was disappointed to see that the lighting system was like Three 's . She knew that Mrs. Grier should n't be allowed to have matches , but surely the others could be trusted . The toilet-paper system was the same here , too . The washroom was exactly like Three 's , but you hoped the shower stalls were used more frequently . The ladies looked as if they bathed often . After Washroom came Rest . You could write letters , if you had paper and pencil ; you could take a nap . You could do anything as long as you did it in your room and broke no rules . Virginia sat on the edge of her bed and prayed she would not wrinkle the blanket . Later in the dayroom she became acquainted with Lola . Lola was married and had dark hair and two very impor- tant teeth out and a sweetheart , not the husband of course , and two children . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband agreed to let her have a divorce and the children . Virginia said she hoped it would work out . She said this several times . Lola was a talker . She talked until Miss Gold announced supper and this was a long time after the Oatey Ladies returned . Virginia wanted to ask Lola what the Oatey Ladies were but Lola was engrossed in talking about her sweetheart . Lola arranged for them to sit together at supper and the saga of the sweetheart was continued . Virginia said she hoped it would work out . But Lola was generous . At Washroom Time she gave Virginia one of the six cigarettes she had taken from Virginia 's pack at noon . But Lola really was generous ; she had forgotten that the cigarettes had once been Virginia 's . There was no medication in Ward One ; there was no bad smell at all . The ladies washed carefully before they retired and there was a good deal of stocking washing . The nightgowns were the same old nightgowns , though , and the cot was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface and you found Juniper Hill . But remember , this is the ward you go home from . This is the springboard . Forget that Lola said she has been here nine months . Nine months in One , almost two years in Juniper 's other wards . But Lola is not sick ; she is simply waiting for the husband to give in . That first day was an unreliable sample . During the first day Virginia scarcely saw Miss Davis ; during subsequentdays she scarcely did not see Miss Davis . It developed that Ward One had harder and faster rules than any you had ever encountered . And the presiding officer had no intention of relaxing. 1i6 117The head nurse made it obvious that she thought Dr. Kik had overstepped when he put V. Cunningham in One . It seemed that she set out deliberately to prove the doctor a fool . Of course Virginia may have had a persecution complex , but she was convinced that Miss Davis went far out of her way to make the wet and dry mop business confusing . Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with wet and dry mops and a series of unbelievably heavy buckets with wringer attachments . It was forbidden to shove the buckets and next to impossible to lift them . You were supposed to dip a wet mop into a bucket , through the wringer thing ; then you were to wring it ; then you were to mop . Then you were to finish off with a dry mop . The wet and dry mops were different mops . A wet mop was a wet mop even when it was dry . A dry mop was the mop Virginia mistookfor a wet mop . Whenever Miss Davis approached , the mop Virginia held turned into being the wrong one . Miss Davis said the mops were unmistakable , but Virginiamistook them easily . But before you began to mop you had to find the equipment . The equipment was kept in a utility room and this room was in a different place each morning . Virginia would follow the other ladies and hope they were headed for the utility room . Sometimes they were . Some of the ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course when you asked Lola for help you had to listen to a good deal about her sweetheart but eventuallyshe told you where the utility room had got to and which mop was which . Virginia shoved the buckets along and when she did this Miss Davis appeared and said was she trying to ruin the linoleum . Virginia asked if that was how her room118had lost its linoleum and Miss Davis told her to attend to her own business . Occasionally Lola had a job off the ward but Virginia stayed on the ward all the time ; she was the only lady who stayed on the ward all the time ; even Mrs. Grier sometimeswent off to a job . In addition to her general work on the ward Virginia had to take care of her room . Miss Davis said her room always looked like a hogpen . No matter how hard you scrubbed the rough cement it looked as if it needed a good scrubbing . Miss Davis said Vir , ginia 's room was a disgrace to the ward and that she had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put anything back . Miss Davis said she not only left mops and buckets all over the place but that she also took other people 's mops and buckets and hid them . If Virginia had known of a good hiding place she would have put herself there . After a week or so Miss Davis and Miss Gold brought a typewriter to Virginia 's room . " Your doctor , " said Miss Davis , " says you may write for an hour each day . Put it on the table , Miss Gold . " Miss Gold put the typewriter on the table . " I 'll have to have a chair , " said Virginia . ' Naturally . " " And some paper . " " I am fully aware of what is necessary . You will use the machine only during Rest Hour . I suppose you 'll make a great racket . " " I do n't want to bother anyone , " said Virginia . " I do n't have to write . " " Dr. Kik says you are to write , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please . " And so Virginia wrote . She wrote that now was the119time for all good men to come to the aid of V. Cunningham . She wrote that Virginia lay sleeping in the moonlight , and longed to be on Wolfe 's thundering train . She wrote a story about the short happy life and changed it around and had him shoot his wife and she called this story The Short Happy Life of Mrs. Francis McComber . She wrote about the cops rushing in . She could not rememberwhy they had rushed and so she wrote that J. Moncure March wrote a poem and then the cops rushed in . It was awful to think of things to write . If she paused more than a minute Miss Davis would come to the doorway and ask what the matter was . When she heard the nurse 's skirts flapping Virginia would hurry to write that a rose was a rose was a rose alas . After Rest IIour she would tear her manuscript into small pieces and put them down the toilet . Miss Davis never caught her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurse would discover her in the act and that from then on all drainage difficulties would be the fault of V. Cunningham . It was imperative , however , to destroy the plagiarized and absurd writing . One afternoon Miss Davis asked her what she was writing . Virginia leaned over the typewriter to hide the story . Today she was doing a piece about a woman who sold her hair and a man who sold his watch . It was difficult for a person who had never considered fob chains or hair combs especially desirable to put any pathos into the sacrificesof Jim and Della . " A book , " she said to the nurse . " What kind of a book ? " " A novel . " " Oh , " said Miss Davis . " I understand from Dr. Kik that you 've had something published . " " A couple of novels . " " I should think you would be interested in serious writing . " " Some people think fiction can be serious . " " There is far too much to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " From my own experienceI can assure you that you will get well sooner if you face reality . " Virginia said nothing . It had been years since she had let herself get hot under the collar about fiction . The last time had been when Florence Young had said she only read fiction in the summer time . " Not that I let myself lie around fallow all summer , " said Florence , " but I mean that there are times in the summer when one simply ca n't face the thought of anything important . " Virginia had got very hot under the collar then . But suddenly she had cooled off and started laughing and since then she had n't bothered about the people who said fiction was inevitably silly . " I notice you do not use the touch system , " said Miss Davis . " No , I never learned it . " " Why not ? " " It was n't given in the pre-college course that I took . It was available only for those who were not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . They have changed it now . " " You could have learned later on . " " I can go rather fast . " " But it 's not efficient . " " I 've always done all my own typing . I like to do it , even though I 'm not efficient . " " You know , Virginia , " said Miss Davis , " I say this only12o 121for your own good , but when you get a more co-operative attitude you 'll be better off . I think if you would forget that you have had a little something published . . . . After all , it 's nothing to be so excited about , is it ? It does n't set you above the other ladies . " Virginia got up . " Miss Davis , " she said , " do I tell you how to be a nurse ? " The nurse smiled ; she had drawn blood , " As I said , my dear , you lack the spirit of co-operation . You really must get rid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you want to get well . " She turned away and the starched skirt flapped briskly down the hall . In a way , the nurse had paid you a compliment . A nurse , provided she was sane , would not permit herself to talk that way to an ill person . Professional dignity would not permit one of the best nurses in the country , if not the best , to enter into an argument with a mental case . Virginia clung to the windowsill and looked at the vista of red brick . It ca n't be that she hates me personally ; she hated me before I came ; it has to be something that lies between her and Dr. Kik . But I refuse to be their football . I 've got to get out of One . It is n't that I 'm afraid she will do me any bodily injury , but I know I ca n't take much more and she is very very much more . For a while we thought he was going to recover , but then  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there a time when you saw , as if at the end of a dark hallway , the light of the outside , a time when you knew you hung at a balance and that such a little push , one way or another , would determine your life ? Did you , at this wavering instant , come up against a Miss122Davis who laughed you , sneered you , chilled you back into the dark ? The delicacy of one 's intellect , one 's sanity , when it is laid open to the specialists . The tissue quivers as under a knife and you , only partly anesthetized , see the light of recovery and the dark of death that is called living , the happy life , the long happy life of the idiot . She heard a scream . That was I who screamed ? A voice ? I ? An insane neighbor ? For a minute the balance was lost . " Robert , " she said softly . " Robert Cunningham . " It was one woman 's way of praying. ivWhen he came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was ashamed to tell him she could not tell the difference between a dry wet mop and a wet dry mop . He spent most of the visit talking about what they would do as soon as she left Juniper Hill . He said it would be very soon and while he was there she believed it would be very soon . He quoted Dr. Kik . He had written home to say they would be there for Thanksgiving . When Virginia was called to the Ward door Robert was there talking to the head nurse . " Who was that old hen ? " he asked when they had sat down in the visitors ' room . " That is Miss Davis , " said Virginia . " She is very efficient . And she 's rather beautiful , do n't you think ? " " God , no , " said Robert . " She looks like a hard propositionto me . I do n't like her . " Lola was entertaining today , too . You wished she could have had her plate , but you imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man she was entertaining123 was startlingly handsome . It was strange that such a good- looking man , obviously years younger than Lola , would fall in love with an unattractive woman who was mar- ried . " That dark-haired one over there is my friend Lola , " Virginia whispered to Robert . " That 's her beau . She has a husband , too . " Robert grunted . He was not interested in Lola . " The hell with Lola , " he said . " Listen , darling , Kik said . . . " When visiting time was over Miss Davis came to the door . She called Lola and then she called Virginia . Her voice indicated that Lola and Virginia had been up to no good . Robert got up and went over to the nurse . " Did you call Mrs. Cunningham ? " he asked . It was a small thing and yet Virginia was sure that Miss Davis was harder on her from then on . And perhaps she imagined that her lot was made harder by Miss Gold say- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cunningham was a keen-looking fella . Imagination , of course . But the shak- ing Miss Davis gave you the next morning over a mop mix-up was not imaginary . You were not injured but you were upset to the point of forgetting . Before you had time to think you said for the nurse to kindly take her hands off . It seemed unlikely that you could graduate from One . Clearly Miss Davis was eager to get rid of such a cotton- head , but you knew she planned to speed you through the back door . So you began on a plot of your own . One morning V. Cunningham mentioned to Miss Gold that she had a pain in her side . Having had appendicitis she knew just where to point . Miss Gold was immediately roused . Was it a sharp pain ? Oh , no , said Virginia , nothing very bad . She could stand it . " Just a little indigestion . I would n't have mentioned it , but I thought you might give me a laxative . " Ah , innocence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst thing . She touched Virginia 's appendectomy scar and Virginia said ooh . " Sorry , but it 's a little tender there . You did n't really hurt me . " In less than a half hour Virginia was sitting in Dr. Kik 's office . " So you have decided to grow another appendix , Jeannie , " he said . " I had to see you , " she said . " It was the only way I could think of . " " Oh , you are thinking up a book plot . " " No , you know Miss Davis would n't have let me come just for the asking . I had to have a reason and she never would have accepted the real reason . " " And that is ? " " Dr. Kik , I ca n't stay in One . I just ca n't . " The doctor raised his eyebrows . She could not remember ever having seen him before and yet she felt as if she knew him intimately . His eyebrows went up exactly as she had known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am not up to it , " she said . " I ca n't remember where things are . I get the mops mixed up . " " You are writing . " She shrugged . " I ca n't write away from home . " " But you are . " " I 'm typing . She comes and asks me what 's wrong if I stop . It is true , is n't it , that you can go home from any ward ? " 124 125 " Yes , " he said , " it is true . " " Then I want to be transferred . " " What about the ladies in One ? Do you become friends with them , yes ? " " Yes . They are kind to me . But it 's so hard to become friends , really friends , here . I 'm always thinking about going home , you know . It 's like making friends in a depot . " " And what does Mr. Cunningham say about the transfer ? " He had leaned back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought he was looking old . He 's no older than I am , maybe younger . " Robert does n't know . You see , he 's so pleased about my being there . I have n't told him how hard it is . All those women know so much more than I do . They never get the mops mixed up and they always know where the utility room is . I never was good at making beds and I simply ca n't make one to suit . I do n't fit in , Doctor . " There at last was the truth . It was n't Miss Davis , it was that you were not well enough for Ward One . " I am not well enough . " " You do not consider yourself well enough for Ward One ? " " I know I 'm not well enough . I forget what I 'm supposedto do . I forget where my room is . It is n't that I do n't try . I do . I really do . " " Well , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She got up . " Thank you so much . " He smiled . " You no longer have the pain in the side ? " " Only in the head , " she said . " And in the neck . " He burst out laughing ; for a foreigner he was veryquick . " Jeannie , " he said , " you must learn discretion . " " I know . I do n't mean it . Oh , I do mean it but the chief126thing is that I know I 'm not well enough . She 's only a small part of it . " " Thank you for coming to me . It was brave of you . " He held out his hand . When she left the student nurse who had acted as her guide , she passed the office of Ward One . Miss Davis looked up from the desk . Virginia nodded a formal acknowledgment and went on to the dayroom . Lola was there . Lola was very excited . Her sweetheart was coming to visit . The husband had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was arranged . " But I thought your sweetheart was here last visiting day , " said Virginia . She had been beginning to realize that Lola was still quite sick . " That ? " Lola gave a scornful laugh . " That was my husband . " Yes , still quite sick. 127CHAPTER EIGHT " I ca n't understand it , " said Miss Gold . " I wish I 'd never made that appointment for you to see him . But I 'm afraid of appendicitis . I had a girl friend to die of it . " " You did right , " said Virginia . " You ca n't take chances with a thing like that . " " But he said it 's nothing to worry about ? " " Yes . It was just one of those things . I probably imagined it . " " Well , I certainly hate to see you leave One . You 're so nearly well and writing every day and all . . . . But do n't pay any attention to me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back with us very soon . " " Um , " said Virginia . " I understand you can go home from any ward , though . " " Oh , sure , sure . And I know you 'll like Mrs. Fledderson . I took my training under her . She 's so , well , not easy , I guess , but she makes it seem easy . " Miss Gold closed the box that held Virginia 's things . " Well , we can go now . I got permission to take you . I do n't get to see Mrs. Fleddersonoften . Funny , with her right down the hall . " Miss Davis was not in the office when they went past it . " In the dayroom , " said Miss Gold , as if Virginia had asked where the head nurse was. 128 " Nursing here must be awfully hard , " said Virginia when they were outside of the ward . " I should think you 'd rather be in a regular hospital . " " Well , you see I 'm engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were engaged before he got sick , I mean . This way I can kind of keep track of him . " " I 'm sorry , " said Virginia . " I hope he is getting better . " Miss Gold sighed . " It takes so long . I mean , for some cases . He 's not like you . But he 'll get well . I always knew he would and now even some of the doctors say so . " She took her key chain in her free hand . " Here we are . " Ward Two . It looked like Ward Three ; it looked like yard One . Anyhow the hallway and the office . At the office desk was a small gray-haired nurse . She jumped up when she saw Miss Gold and Virginia . " Goldie , " she said . " How 'd you get away ? You been fired ? " Miss Gold laughed . " And that 's no joke , " she said . " This is Mrs. Cunningham , Mrs. Fledderson . " Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she realized that Mrs. Fledderson 's outstretched hand meant something else . " I 'm real glad to have you with us , Mrs. Cunningham . Dr. Kik has told me about you . " I would give a pretty to know what he said . Out in the world you would say , Nothing bad , I hope ; and the other person would simper and say , Well , now , I 'm not saying . But you keep your mouth shut here . Remember you ca n't trust yourself ; you might say something and give yourselfaway . " Goldie , you wait till I take her to the dayroom and then we can have a little visit .... " " Gee , I ca n't , Fled . You know how it is . " " Honestly , " said Mrs. Fledderson . She turned her eyes129tip to the ceiling . " When I think about some things I . about pass out . " She and Miss Gold exchanged glances . Virginia looked at the floor and pretended not to know what they were talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Miss Gold . " Honestly , something ought to be done about it . " " I might get appendicitis , " said Miss Gold . " I just now thought of that . It might be an idea . What do you think , Virginia ? " Virginia felt herself blushing . " I do n't know what you mean , " she said . Miss Gold laughed . " Gee , was I dumb . I just now caught , on to something . Fled , your new one is a schemer . . . . Kid , I hand it to you . It 's been tried before , the general idea , I mean , but it 's never worked before . Fleddie , keep . an eye on her or she 'll talk her way out of here before you know it . " " Fine , " said Mrs. Fledderson . After Miss Gold left them they went to the dayroom . " Of course it 's nothing so grand as One , " said Mrs. Fled-.derson , " but we get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't much want to be here myself . But if you 've got to stay a while you might as well try to make the best of it and take it easy while you can . Dr. Kik says you write . " " Yes , " said Virginia , " but I 'd rather not do any here , f it 's all right not to . " " Sure , it 's all right not to . I do n't see how you could do Any here anyhow . Wait till you get home . Well , this is the parlor . We have a radio , you hear . Madge , will you turn that radio down a little ? You want to split our eardrums ? " 130iiThe ladies of Two were very friendly . They were not so well groomed and bright as the ladies in One , but they seemed more relaxed . Each morning there was a big to-do about mopping floors and making beds , but it was rather fun . People helped you and you helped them . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a burden as possible . Her ward did not begin to look as neat as Miss Davis ' . It is the sad truth that ladies anywhere will take advantage . " Kids , " the head nurse might say some morning , " I wish you 'd give it the old business today . One of the big shots coming through and I do n't want to lose my job . " And that morning the kids would go to town on the mopping and polishing and the next day Mrs. Fledderson would bring around a box of cookies or something . " Everyone hates to leave Two , " a lady told Virginia " When one of us is sent to One it 's like a funeral . " When Robert came he met Mrs. Fledderson and then he was reconciled to the change . He said Dr. Kik had explained it to him . " He thought it was wonderful of you , " he said . " I just could n't bear that woman another day , " said Virginia , " and I had to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He says you 're almost well . He says you 'll be going , to Staff soon . " " Where 's that ? " " It 's just a group of doctors . They talk to you a little before you go home . That 's all . " " It sounds terrible , " she said . " Why , it 's just a matter of routine , " said Robert . " Dr.131Kik will be there and he 'll take care of everything . You promise me you wo n't worry . " Virginia smiled . She was having to use that smile a good deal . Two , for all its informal atmosphere , was confusing . There were things to remember ; you were supposedto remember where your bed was and where the washroom was and things like that . The nurses did n't get mad if you forgot ; but you could tell they were surprised . The ladies of Two were not as bright as buttons and yet , except for Virginia , they always knew where their beds were and where the washroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they usually knew what day it was . Virginia could n't remember anything but her name . Often she wondered how she remembered that . She forgotwhat ward she was in ; she forgot Mrs. Fledderson 's name ; she forgot the names of her new friends ; she forgot Dr. Kik 's name . Dr. Kik did not know this . She called him Doctor and he was satisfied . He said she was coming along beautifully beautifully . She went with a group of Two ladies to Oatey . This was O.T. , Occupational Therapy . The ladies sat in a circle and sewed and embroidered . The teacher gave Virginia a towel with a stamped pattern for cross-stitch . She told Virginia how to cross-stitch . Virginia knew how , or at any rate she had once known how . She did n't say so . You could n't be sure that it was like riding a bicycle . But when you started out the skill of your childhood returned and you cross-stitched every bit as well as you had done when you were seven , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies , Betsy , cried and cried. towel . When you thought about the things Dr. Kik noted132down you did n't know whether to laugh or to be terrified . You thought about him trying to say cross-stitch , but you did n't dare laugh about Dr. Kik to Robert . Robert changed his voice when he said the doctor 's name . Robert simply worshipped that doctor . " Mrs. Fledderson says I can take you to the store for a soda , " Robert said , after he had stopped talking about the famous towel . " But I do n't have any coat , " said Virginia , " and you said it 's cold outside . " But here came Mrs. Fledderson with the green coat and the green hat with the fur cuff . " You look like a million dollars in that outfit , " the nurse said , after Robert had helped you into the coat . A million dollars . I would rather look like an ordinary woman . I would rather have them say you look well , well in that outfit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be winter . " " You ought to have your muff , " said Robert anxiously . " Oh no , it 's too nice for here . I can put my hands in my pockets . " She thrust her hands into the coat pockets and in each pocket was a glove ; in one pocket was a crumpled handkerchief . " Look what 's been in here all the time , " she said . It was like getting into the pockets of a dead woman . The faint perfume of the handkerchief was like the scent from withered burial wreaths . " Maybe I ought to bring your muff next time . " " No , I said it 's too nice for here . Something might happen to it . " " You 'll want it when you leave , though . " " You 'll come after me , wo n't you ? " " What do you think ? " " You might bring the muff along that day . A signal . " 133 " All right . It wo n't be long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very soon . " Can I ever fake it ? How long can reflex action carry you through ? The store was a little drug store with tables and wirebackedchairs and a soda fountain . She had always thought of Juniper 's store as being just a storeroom , but it was a real store . Oh , maybe not entirely real . Some of the customerswere not real . You could tell . You could tell when you were one of the unreal ones . Robert seated her at a table and then he went to get the sodas . It was self-service , he explained . She sat there , trembling . Alone , alone , and some of the people around her were well people . Were they looking at her and thinkingthere is one of the sick ones , there is one of the people who live here ? I wo n't let them scare me . I 'll look at them . She looked around the room and she saw Lola and Lola was sitting with a little old bald-headed man and grinning like a Cheshire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorously . She had a feeling that Lola 's athletic wave must look very strange to the real people who were here . Robert said the sodas were good , but Virginia was too self-conscious to taste the drink . At the next table an old lady was trying to persuade a young man not to eat his sundae with his hands ; she swiped at him now and then with a napkin . At another table two men were having coffee . I ca n't tell which is which ; maybe they ca n't tell about me . She looked at Robert . No , no one would ever think he might be the one . Whereas I was always rather silly-looking . It is n't fair . Robert talked about what was going on in town . He had been to see Helene ; he told a funny story about one134of Helene 's radicals . When he laughed Virginia knew it had been a funny story and so she laughed too . " Oh , that Helene , " she said . We are talking just like people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Afterwards he was invited to the apartment of one of the cast ; he had met so many people , in these months , that she did not know . " It sounds like fun , " she said . " But nothing 's fun , " he said , " when you are n't along . But you 'll be along very soon , darling . " He told her about their plans , how the family had arranged for them to stay at home with them until Virginiawas well enough . " . . . well enough for a place of our own . " He told about Mag and Ted and the baby . Virginia listened . No , she did n't listen . She put on the face that a listener wears . Reflex action . Slower , Robert , slower . I ca n't follow . I ca n't keep up . I 'm not as well as you think . And then Lola came over to the table and grinned that deplorable toothless grin . Only two teeth out but two very important teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my husband was him , " she said . " I wanted to be sure you saw him today . " " I see him , " said Virginia . The little old bald-head over by the door . " I hope everything is working out . " " It 's going to be wonderful , " said Lola . " My husband 's going to let me have a divorce and the children . So as soon as I get out . . . But I must n't keep my boy-friend waiting . " " I should have introduced you , " said Virginia to Robert after Lola had rushed back to the boy-friend , " but I do n't know her last name . And anyway , things seem differenthere . " " Yes , " said Robert , " they do . " 135There was another way to look at it . You had always heard that crazy people think themselves sane . Does it follow then that if you think you are crazy , you are sane ? Dr. Kik , when she saw him , went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; like Robert , he talked too fast for her . He never seemed disturbed by her answers and so they must have fitted . How long could she continue the pretense ? Or was she mistaken ? The nearest well ladies of Two treated her as if she was one of them . They told her about the few who were not so well . They talked a good deal about going to Staff , about going to One , about going home . Like people outsidethey talked a good deal about themselves . Virginia had been no slouch about talking . While the ladies talked she remembered that once she had been a talker , but now she sat silent and pretended to listen , pretended to understand . The few necessary responses made her feel as if she had been climbing mountains . " You are so sympathetic , " said one lady . " I can tell you everything and you understand what I mean . " And Virginia would n't know if this lady was just startingon everything or just finishing ; she would not know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made no difference to the lady but it made a difference to V. Cunningham . Wise people say I am almost ready to go home . If I am going to be this way the rest of my life I would rather be dead . But that is not the choice . What you heard about Staff was not reassuring . All of the ladies were scared of Staff ; quite a few of them had been there once or twice and they shuddered when they136spoke of their experiences . Virginia tried to listen , to pick up pointers , but all she picked up was the terror . As the days ran faster she moved in a thickening fog and Staff came closer . Mrs. Fledderson rounded up the candidates and gave them a cheery send-off . She acted as if they were going to a party . She laid it on a little too thick and the ladies giggled nervously . " You 're my honor students , " said Mrs. Fledderson . " Go in and pitch . You 're the first team . " A muscle in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an undertaker . An assistant nurse took them away . Silently they marched down the corridor to a little room where the nurse said they would wait . The ladies sat in a row on folding chairs . Now and then the nurse went out to the hall . She seemed uncertain about the procedure and her manner destroyed any remnant of confidence Virginia 's reflex might have retained . At last the nurse called out a name . There was a smothered laugh , or was it a sob , and then one lady got up and went out . After a long time she came back . " They do n't tell you anything , " she said . " I do n't know . They do n't tell you anything . They just write things . Every time you open your mouth they write something down . " " Now , now , " said the nurse , " do n't get the ladies upset . " Another lady was called . This went on for a long time . Finally Virginia was called . She got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see . She stumbled after the nurse . Going through the door she struck one of her shoulders against the door frame . The nurse took her to a room where six or eight or137maybe six or seven people sat . They sat facing an empty chair . She looked for Dr. Kik but she could not see him . Someone told her to sit down . The only vacant chair was the one facing the audience . " Now , Mrs. Cunningham , " said a voice that was all wrong , " just make yourself comfortable . We want to ask you a few questions . " The man was standing near her now . It was not Dr. Kik . It was a short fat man with a harsh voice . He asked her her name . He was holding a paper and she was sure her name was on that paper . " Virginia Stuart Cunningham , " she said . Her vision had cleared a little and she saw that the people in the audience had papers and pencils . When she spoke they used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were two women and the rest were men but none of them was Dr. Kik . The man asked her where she had been born and when . Maybe I can get through it without my own doctor . Maybe I can . " Where were you living when you became ill ? " " New York , " she said . " Where in New York ? " " New York City . " " I mean , where in New York City ? " " Manhattan , " she said . " Yes ? " " Yes . " " Mrs. Cunningham , what was your address in New York ? " I knew all the time that was what you meant . " I do n't know . " The audience wrote intently. 138 " Come now , you know your own address . Just think a moment . " " I 've forgotten it , " she said . " I never could remember figures . " " What street did you live on ? " " I ca n't remember . We lived on Waverly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was another one , not Bleecker , but another one . Maybe Christopher . " No , that 's Helene . " Is your husband still occupying your apartment ? " " Of course . " " You are sure of this ? " " No , but I think he would have said something if he had moved . " The audience wrote on the papers . " Your husband has been here to see you ? " asked the little man . " Yes . " " How often does he come ? " " As often as the rule allows . " " How often is that ? " She looked at him in surprise . " Why , do n't you know ? " There was a sound from the audience ; the little man turned around for a moment . " Mrs. Cunningham , " he said crossly , as if irritated by her getting a laugh he should have had , " I know . I know all about it . I am simply trying to find out if you know . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you change the rule ? " " How often are you allowed to have visitors , Mrs. Cunningham ? Will you please answer the questions ? It will make it easier for all of us . " " Once every two weeks , that is , my husband is **32;1795;TOOLONG off the water . Boone studied Teal Eye again . Would she be purty , older , like she was now ? Purty as a Ree woman ? And willing ? Willing if a man was a sure-enough buffalo hunter ? Summers yelled , " Mister Caudill . " His face was screwed up , fierce , but underneath his eyebrows his eyes had a twinkle . Boone jumped to the passe avant and walked along it . From behind , Summers gave him a push , and he lunged into the crowd , trying to keep his feet , while hands grabbed at him and an arm clenched around his neck and someone got him from behind in a bear hug . They surged around the little deck . Once he broke loose and caught a glimpse of Jim with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it hogged like the mane of a mule , and then they were on him again . He felt the weight and pressure of them all around him , felt the breaths panting on his neck and the hands reaching and grabbing . For a minute a crazy fright came up in him , and something else , something rising from deep down in him , a mad spell or a laughing spell , one , while voices shouted in his ears . He jerked and squirmed with a sudden , wild strength . Summers puffed , " This hoss be as strong as a young bull . " He heard himself laughing then , hollering and laughing , while they pinned his arms and got him by the feet and bent him down on his butt on the deck . Jourdonnais said , " We initiate l'enfant , " and Summers answered , " This nigger feels like raisin ' h'ar . " Hands came from behind him and clamped over his eyes . " We made a Pawnee out of Deakins . We 'll make a Maha papoose out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the razor on his scalp , moving and catching and moving again while the blade sang . " There , by beaver ! " He ran his loosened hand over his head . It was as bare as a stone , except for a tuft in front and one behind . They were circled around him , laughing . He looked up at the eyes on him and the mouths wide and tried to keep on laughing himself , but he felt the blood cominginto his face and a notion came into his head to hit out at somebodyor get up and clear out of sight . Then he saw Jim again , looking as funny as a body ever could with just the ridge of hair running down the middle . Jim was a mule himself , with a cut red mane , a mule with tears running down his face he was laughing so hard , and laughing all the harder , Boone realized , because now he was laughing , too . P101Jourdonnais tugged at him , offering a tin cup , not alcohol and water this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feeling his tongue tingle . Labadie was on the passe avant , looking worried . " For this , " he cried , " I get across . Yes ? No ? " He held up a bottle . " Good ! Oui ! " They snatched the bottle from him , sucking at the mouth of it like men half-dead for a drink . " For that , " said Romaine , " we not shave you . We give you bath only . " His great arm flashed out and caught Labadie and yanked him down . Labadie squealed . " Easy now , " Romaine said . " Easy . " He dropped a loop of rope over Labadie and lifted him and lowered him over the side , dunking him like a piece of corn bread on a string . Labadie screamed in French and came back cursing and strangling , and Romaine beat him on the back until he flung free and fled to the bow . " Next wan , " said Jourdonnais . When it was over , the Platte lay behind them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , Jourdonnais put in early and treated them to more brandy , looking relieved and almost happy now , while the boatmen drank and sang and wrestled on the bank . At dawn they went on , using the cordelle along the open banks , for the river turned and turned again , like a running snake . " Huffier country yit ? " " Soon , now . Soon . I 'll tell ye . " Summers ' eyes were always on the banks or the bluffs above them , seeing things maybe another man would n't see . The trees grew smaller and scarcer here , stringingalong the bottoms as if they had given up the hills for good . They were cottonwoods mostly , with here and there an ash or a wild plum just beginning to break white with bloom . Banks sliding by , sunup and noon and sundown , and the river leading on , flanked by the pale green of new leaves . Pelicans flappingover at twilight , a passel of them , flying wedge-shaped to the north . Wild geese along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along behind , making quiet V 's in the water . Whippoorwillscalling . An eagle 's nest high in an old tree , and Indian hunting wigwams , empty and falling down . And always the line or poles or oars and sometimes the sail , on and on , on a river without an end , on a river that flowed under them and led ahead , to Councilp102Bluffs , to the Yellowstone , to the Blackfeet , to buffler , catching the sky at evening and winding on like a silver sheet . " We put in at Cabanne 's , " Jourdonnais said at night , and Summers ' eyes raised and asked a question , and Jourdonnais went on , " I know him for long time . He is all right . A friend . " " Works for the company , allasame . " Jourdonnais nodded . " We stop for a minute only , to say hello . Also , to find out what goes on above . We maybe get some jerked meat , from the Mahas . " " Meat aplenty soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , here , aims to shine at makin ' meat , eh ? " Boone said , " I aim to try . " " Meat ahead , " said Jourdonnais . " Also Sioux and Rees . Better to have a little meat on board . " They went ahead under sail at dawn . On the left bank the poplarsstood naked , dead from fire , their limbs reaching out at the sky like the bones of a hand . Beyond them , past a creek , a chain of green and wooded hills rolled up . There were huts on the bank along the river , and bigger buildings above them on the bluff . A halfdozenIndians stood on the bank watching . The boatmen yelled at them and waved , and they lifted their hands and let them come down slow , as if they were tired or disappointed because the boat did n't come in . A squaw in a blue dress that hung around her like a sack kept watching , her broad face turning with them , until she was only a patch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the green , stores and cabinsand a two-story house with a balcony overlooking the river . " Mahas , Otos , and maybe a few Ioways , " said Summers , sizing up the crowd on shore while Depuy blew on a trumpet to give noticethat the Mandan was coming in . A few rifle shots sounded as a welcome from the post , and four guns from the Mandan answered . Some of the Indians were dressed in buffalo skins , hairy side out , and some had blankets striped with paint . Children stood among them , potbellied and chill-looking without a stitch of clothes on them . The Indians moved aside a little as the Mandan came in , to let through a man who walked importantly and put out his hand as Jourdonnais jumped ashore . They stood talking as Frenchmen did , with their eyes and hands as much as their mouths . Boone reck/oned the man must be Cabanne . The Indians had their faces painted , some of them with red stripes that ran down their cheeks and others with raw blotches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their foreheads and chins . Jourdonnais called back . " Do not leave the boat ! Non ! We go on quick . Let no one on , Summers . " A squaw with eyes as small as beans and hair hanging loose down her back pressed to the front , her hands out , putting one forefinger on top of the other and then the other on top of the first , making a sign . She pointed between her legs and looked up while she made the sign again , her little eyes asking a question . From the boat Romaine called " Hah ! " and held up a coin , and then added another to it , but she shook her head , still making the sign with her fingers . The men were jeering at Romaine , looking at the squaw and then at Romaine and jeering , their eyes sharp and hungry . Romaine pocketed the coins and pointed down at himself and then held his two hands out , a foot apart , like a man giving the size of a fish . His eyebrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little of his brag , but the squaw just looked at him , unsmiling , her fingers still fiddling . Underneath the old skin dress that was pulled in at the middle Boone could see the fat of her breasts jiggle . He turned his head toward the boat and saw Teal Eye gazing out , her face for once lively and off guard . An old Indian , with one eye and a face so pitted a man would think hawks had pecked at it , came up to Boone and Jim , who had jumped from the boat and stood at the edge of the water . His empty socket was sunken and red-lidded and weeping a thick yellow drop that he tried to brush away with the knuckle of one hand . In the other he held a long black pipe , ringed with circles of lead . Grunting , he put his finger in the bowl to show that it was empty . His hand reached out to them , begging . Jourdonnais and Cabanne came from inside the post followed by four Indians . Jourdonnais said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned carrying a skin bag and went back and got another . It was jerked buffalo or pemmican , Boone imagined . " Tobacco , " Jourdonnais said to Summers , who undid a lashingon the cargo box . The Indians all crowded around Jourdonnais as he took the dark twists . They talked in their throats , as if it werep104the throat that shaped the sound , and held out their hands . Jourdonnaispaid the four and looked around at the empty hands and dropped a twist into the palm of the old man with one eye . Cabanne shrugged when the deal was done . " Better the Mahas and the Otos than the Blackfeet . No ? " he said to Jourdonnais . " You get the beaver , maybe . More likely they take your scalp . " Jourdonnais ran his fingers through his thick head of hair . " I do not need so much . " Cabanne 's face was troubled . " Take care , my friend , of Indians , and other things , too . " For an instant Jourdonnais ' eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shrugging again , saying nothing , as if what he had said was enough , and maybe too much . " Allons ! " cried Jourdonnais and shook hands with Cabanne . The banks sliding again and the river winding on , past an old fort at Council Bluffs , where Summers said three hundred soldiers died from scurvy once ; through a stretch of river thick with snags , through country low for a while and then hilly again , bare of trees but green with grass ; past Wood 's Hills where a million swallows had nested in the yellow rock . " Buffler country yit ? " " Quick now . Purty quick . " To Blackbird Hill , where a chief was buried ; to Floyd 's Bluff , the river slackening and the banks lying low and the Big Sioux coming in ; to Vermilion creek , where Summers pointed out the silver berry bush that the Creoles called the graisse de boeuf ; on toward the Riviere a Jacques and the Running Water , on by stroke and pull and push and sail , day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky and hid behind the hills . It was still dark when Summers prodded Boone . " Time to shine . " Boone lay for an instant , blinking , seeing one star like a hole in the sky . " Bailer ! " he said to himself and scrambled up.  | Boone picked his way among the sleeping men . Jourdonnais ' face , faintly horned with the spikes of his mustache , was a dark circle against his darker robe . He was snoring the long deep snore of a man worn out . " I got you a Hawken , " Summers said from the keelboat , keeping his voice low . He handed a gun and horn and pouch over the side to Boone . " It 's the real beaver , for buflier or anything . " Boone hefted the rifle and tried it at his shoulder . It was heavierthan Old Sure Shot , and it was a flintlock , not a cap and ball , but it felt good to him  --  well-balanced and stout , like a piece a man could depend on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not light yet but not dark , either . The men lying in their blankets looked big , like horses or buffalo lying down . The mast of the keelboat , dripping with dew , glistened a little . Boone could hear the water lapping against the sides of the Mandan . Farther out , the river made a quiet , busy murmur , as if it were talking to itself of things seen upcountry . Once in a while one of the men groaned and moved , easing his muscles on the earth . " It 's winter ground mostly , " said Summers , coming down from the boat , " but might be we can get our sights on one . " They started up the river , moving out from the fringe of trees to the open country at the base of the hills , hearing a sudden snort and the sound of flight from a thicket . " Elk , " said Summers . " Poor doin 's , to my way of thinking , if there 's aught else about . We 'll git @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Poor ? I was thinkin ' they 're tasty , the ones we shot so far . " " Nigh anything 's better . Dog , for a case . Ever set your teeth in fat pup ? " Summers made a noise with his lips . " Or horse ? A man gets a taste for it . And beaver tail ! I 'm half-froze for beaver tail . And huffier , of course , fat fleece and hump rib and marrow bones too good to think of . " " That 's best , I reckon . " " You reckon wrong . Painter meat , now , that 's some . Painter meat , that 's top , now . " Summers ' moccasined feet seemed to make no noise at all . " But meat 's meat , snake meat or man meat or what . "  |p106Boone  turned to study the hunter 's lined and weathered face , wondering if he had eaten man meat , seeing an arm or leg browningand dripping over the fire . " Injuns like dead meat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shore , huffier that would stink a man out of a skunk 's nest . This nigger 's et skunk , too . It ai n't so bad , if he ai n't squirted . The Canadians , now , they set a heap of store by it . It 's painter meat to them . " The stars had gone out , and the sky was turning a dull white , like scraped horn . A low cloud was on fire to the east , where the sun would come up . Boone could make out the trees , separate from each other now and standing against the dark hills  --  short , squatty trees , big at the base , which could hold against the wind . They walked slow , just dragging along , while Summers ' eyes kept poking ahead and the light came on and Boone could follow the Missouri with his eye , on and on until it got lost in a far tumble of hills . The ground was spotted in front of them with disks of old buffalo manureunder which the grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he turned one over with his toe , little black beetles scurried out into the grass . " Ai n't any fresh , " he said . His eyes searched the hills and the gullies that wormed up through them from the river bottom . " Reckonwe wo n't find any ? " Summers did n't answer right away . He would look east , up on the slope of the hills and west to the woods and river and beyond them to where other hills rose up , making a cradle for the Missouri , and sometimes his eyes would stop and fix on something , as if it might be game or Indians , and go on after a while and stop again . Boone tried to see what he was seeing , but there was only the river winding ahead and the slopes of the hills and the gullies cutting into them and here and there a low tree , flattened at the top , where birds were chirping . Half the sun was showing , shining in the grass where the dew was beaded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even a piece of one now that the one to the east had burned out , and the air was still and waiting-like , as if it were worn out and resting up for a blow . " Sight easier to kill game along the river , where a man don'tp107have to tote it , " Summers said , following the valley with his eyes . " Let 's point our stick up , anyway . " He turned and started uphill . From the top Boone could see forever and ever , nearly any way he looked . It was open country , bald and open , without an end . It spread away , flat now and then rolling , going on clear to the sky . A man would n't think the whole world was so much . It made the heart come up . It made a man little and still big , like a king looking out . It occurred to Boone that this was the way a bird must feel , free and loose , with the world to choose from . Nothing moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river he could see the keelboatshowing between the trees , nosing up river like a slow fish . He marked how she poked ahead . He looked on to the tumble of hills that closed in on the river and wondered if she could ever get that far . Summers had halted , his nose stuck out , like a hound feeling for a scent . " Air 's movin ' west , if it 's movin ' at all , I 'm thinkin ' . All right . " He stepped out again , walking with a loose , swift ease . The sun got up , hot and bright as steel . Off a distance the air began to shimmer in it . Summers kept along the crest of the hills , going slow when they came in sight of a gully or a swale . It was in one of them that they saw the buffalo , standing quiet with its head down , as if its thoughts were away off . Summers ' hand touched Boone 's arm . " Old bull , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted his great head and turned it toward them , looking , his beard hanging low . " He seen us , " Boone whispered . " He 'll make off . " " Shoo ! " said Summers , putting his hand on the lifted barrel of Boone 's rifle . " They ca n't see for nothin ' , and hearin ' do n't mean a thing to ' em . It 's all right , long as he do n't get wind of us . " He started forward , walking slow . " You kin shoot him . " " Now ? " " Wait a spell . " The bull did n't move . He stood with his head turned and down , as if for all his blindness he knew they were there . Boone 's mind went back to his blind Aunt Minnie who could always tell when someone was around . Her head would pivot and her face would wait , while she looked out of eyes that did n't see . " Take your wipin ' stick . Make a rest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's length and had Boone hold it with his left hand and let the rifle lie across his wrist . " Let ' im have it . " The rifle bucked against Boone 's shoulder , cracking the silence . The ball made a gut-shot sound , and a little puff of dust came from the buffalo , as if he had been hit with a pebble . For an instant he stood there looking dull and sad , as if nothing had happened , and then he broke into a clumsy gallop , heading out of the gully . Boone watched him , and heard another crack by his side and saw the bull break down at the knees and fall ahead on his nose . He lay on his side , his legs waving , his breath making a snore in his nose . Summers was reloading , grinning as he did so . " Too high . " Boone felt naked in the bright blue gaze of his eyes , as if what he felt in his mind was standing out for the hunter to see . Summers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . Nigh everybody shoots high , first time . Just a hand and a half above the brisket , that 's the spot . It 's a lesson for you . Best to load up again , afore anything . " Quicker than Boone could believe , Summers charged his gun . He hitched his pouch and powder horn around , drew the stopper from the horn with his teeth , put the mouth of it in his left hand , and with his right turned the horn up . He was ramming down his load before Boone got his powder measured out . The buffalo 's eyes were fading . They looked soft now , deep and soft with the light going out of them . His legs still waved a little . Summers put his knife in his throat . " We 'll roll him over , and this child 'll show you how to get at good feedin ' . " He planted the four legs out at the sides , so that the buffalo seemed to have been squashed down from above . The hunter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut crosswise on the neck , and Summers grabbed the hair of the boss with his other hand and separated the skin from the shoulder . He laid the skin open to the tail and peeled it down the sides , spreading it out . " Ca n't take much , " he said , chopping with his hatchet . " Tongue and liver and fleece fat and such . Or maybe one of us best go and git some help from the boat . Wisht we had a pack mule . " " There 's a wolf . " Summers looked around at the grinning face that watched them from behind a little rise . " Buffler wolf . White wolf . " He spokep109in jerks while his knife worked . " I seen fifteen-twenty of ' em circledround sometimes . " " Do n't you never shoot ' em ? " " Have to be nigh gone for meat . Ai n't enough powder and ball on the Missouri to shoot ' em all . " Boone found a rock and pitched it at the wolf . The head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two away . Summers kept looking up from his butchering , turning to study every direction , and then going back to the bull again . " See them cayutes ? " Boone watched them slink up , their feet moving as if they ran a twisting line , their eyes yellow and hungry . They came closer than the wolf and sat down . Their tongues came out and dripped on the grass . " Watch ! " Summers threw a handful of gut toward them . The bigger one darted in , seized the gut , and made off , but he had n't got far before the wolf jumped on him and took it away . The coyote came back and sat down again . " Happens every time , " said Summers . He had the liver out , and the gall bladder . He cut a slice of liver and dipped it in the bladder and poked it in his mouth , chewing and gulping while he worked . " For poor bull , it ai n't so bad . Want some ? " Boone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it , he saw the cloud of dust . It came from behind a little pitch of land maybe two miles to the north , and it was n't a cloud so much as a vapor , a wisp that he expected to disappear like a fleck in the eye . He wondered whether to point it out to Summers . The wisp came on to the top of the pitch . There was a movement under it . He said then , " Reckon you catched sight of that ? " Summers looked long , the knife idle in his hand . " I be dogged ! Hold still now ! It 's brown skin , sure as I be , but maybe just Puncas . " After what seemed to Boone a long time , he added , " Let 's backup toward cover . We can cache , maybe . Here 's a hoss as do n't like it . " He peeled off his shirt and spread it on the ground and put on it the parts of the carcass he had cut out to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes against the glare . Those were horses under the dust cloud , with riders on them . " Might be we can git back with this here , " said Summers.  | " They seen us all right . " He lifted his parcel . " Poor doin 's , anyhow , to let Injuns think you 're runnin ' . Even the squaws get braved up then , and full of hell . Ease away , now . " His voice was sure and quiet . Boone scanned the river , looking for the Mandan . " Ai n't hardly had time to pull this fur , " said Summers , " with no breeze to help . " They dropped down behind the crest of the hills , out of sight of the Indians . " Hump it ! Hump it some ! " They broke for the thin timber two hundred yards and more away , with Summers holding his bundle out from him so as not to hinder his leg . " I 'll take ' er , " Boone panted , but Summers only shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an unhurried walk . The Indians came to the top of the hill and halted , outlined against the sky . " We 'll make peace sign . " Summers put his parcel down and fired his rifle at the sky . Afterwards , he took his pipe out and held it high for the Indians to see . The Indians looked and talked among themselves , until one of them yelled and all joined in , a kind of high , quavering yell . They sent their horses down the bluff , the hoofs making a clatter in a patch of stones . " Gim me your Hawken and load this ' un . " They were still a throw away from the fringe of woods along the river . Summers took the wiping stick from its slot while he watched . " Sioux , by beaver , or this nigger do n't know Injun . They ca n't circle us here , anyways . Git ready , old hoss , but hold fire till I give the sign . " He planted his wiping stick out before him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's it , boss , and line your sights on the belly , not the head . " A hundred and fifty yards away the Indians pulled up . Boone counted them . Twelve men . They were naked from the waist up , unless a man counted the feathers stuck in their hair . Their skin looked smooth and soft , like good used leather . It would make a better strop than the one he 'd left in Louisville . Three or four had guns in their hands , and the others bows . Their horses minced around as they waited . " It ai n't a war party , anyhow , " Summers said , as if he was makingtalk at night around the fire . " How can a body tell ? " " No paint . No shields . They 're huntin ' , I 'm thinkin ' . "  |p111Summers  stood up . His voice went out , rough and steady and strong , in language Boone did n't understand , and his hands made movements in front of him . The Indians listened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes as the horses moved Boone could see the Indians ' hair , hanging far down in plaits . The foremost of them , though , the one who seemed to be the leader , had chopped it off short . Summers ' voice came to a halt . To Boone he said , " A man never knows about Sioux . " The Indians sat their milling horses . Their heads moved , and their hands , as they talked to one another . The Indian with the short hair rode out . The tail of some animal hung from his moccasin . His voice was stronger than Summers ' and came more from his chest . " Asks if we 're squaws , to run , " Summers translated . " And what have we got for presents ? His tongue is short but his arm is long , and he feels blood in his eye . " The Indian halted , waiting for Summers ' reply . " I 'm thinkin ' they just met up with an enemy and got the worst of the tussle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll tell ' em our tongues ai n't so long either , but our guns is a heap longer'n them crazy fusees . " His voice went out again . Suddenly , while the rest watched , the Indian with the short hair let out a yell and put his horse to a gallop , coming straight at them . He was low on his horse , just the top of him showing and the legs at the sides . Summers dropped to one knee again and leveled his gun , and nothing seemed to move about him except the end of the barrel bearing on the rider . Boone was down , too , with his rifle up , seeing the outflung hoofs of the horse and the flaring nostrils . He would be on them in a shake . The horse bore out a little , and the cropped head moved , and the black of a barrel came over the horse 's neck . Summers ' rifle spoke , and in a wink the horse was running free , shying out in a circle and going back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move . " That 's one for the wolves , " Summers said . His hand came over and gave Boone the empty rifle and took the loaded one and drew away with it . " Load up ! "  |p112The  Indians had sat , watching the one and yelling for him . They hushed when he fell and then all began to yell again , the voices rising shrill and falling . They set their horses to a run streakingto one side and then the other , not coming directly at Boone and Summers , but working closer as the line went back and forth . Sometimes one , bolder than the rest , would charge out of the line and come nearer , waving his gun or bow while he shouted , and then go back to the line again . " Hold your sights on one , " said Summers , " the one on the speckled pony . Hold fire till I tell you . Then plumb center with it . " He had taken his pistols from his belt and had them out before him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the horses , swinging to the off side as they turned . " Shoo ! " Summers said . " They ca n't ride for nothin ' . Ca n't shine with Comanches , or even Crows . " " Why' n't they charge , all of ' em ? " Summers ' eye ran along the barrel of his gun . " They got no stummick for that kind of doin 's , save once in a while one likes to shine alone , like that nigger out there . " A rifle cracked , and in front of them the ground exploded in a little blast of dust . " Steady . Time to go ag'in . " Out of the corner of his eye Boone saw smoke puff from the gun . A running horse stumbled and fell . The Indians shouted , higher and wilder . The fallen horse lay on its rider . Boone saw the rider , just the head and jerking hands of him beyond the horse , trying to pull his leg free . Summers handed over the empty rifle . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the off sides of their horses , and , stooping behind the downed horse , rolled the withers up . The fallen rider tried to arise and went off crawling , dragging one leg . The others , driven back a little by the shot , began to come in again , working to and fro . One of them bobbed up and swung his rifle over . The ball sang past Boone . He had the rifle primed again , and the Indian on the speckled pony on his sights . " Kin I shoot one ? " He did n't wait . The sights seemed to steady of themselves and fix just above the pony 's neck . His fingers bore on the trigger , like it had a mind of its own . The rifle jumped . " I be dogged . " The speckled pony shied off . Behind him a man squirmed on the ground , squirmed and got up and went back , bent at the middle.  | " Slicker'n ice , Caudill . " The Indians bunched up , talking and gesturing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Summers , raising his cheek from his rifle . He added , " For now . " " That 's the boat . " The trumpet had sounded , cutting through the still air , rolling up river and out to the hills and coming back on itself . Boone saw the Mandan . The oars made little even flashes as the men laid them back . Someone was busy in the bow . It looked like Jourdonnais . It was him , working at the swivel gun , which was a bar of light in the how . The Indians looked , holding their horses tight , easing them backward away from the river . The swivel belched smoke , and the sound of it came to them , a rolling boom like thunder . Jourdonnais got busy with it again . " First shot was just to skeer ' em . Second 'll be business . " But the Sioux drew off , turning back and shouting and shaking their arms as they went . Boone watched them long enough to see that they picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his belt and fitted his wiping stick to his rifle . He and Boone walked ahead , to the Indian who lay still in the grass . Summers stooped over . His knife cut into the scalp and made a rough circle , from which the blood beaded . He got hold of the Indian 's short hair and tore the circle loose , leaving the piece of skull naked and raw . " Take his gun . This Injun 's had a grief lately . Some of his kin 's gone under  --  a brother , maybe . That 's why he chopped his tails off . Looks recent , do n't it ? Like as not it just happened . That 's why they was so froze for our scalps , so 's they would n't have to go home beaten and with nary thing to shine with . " He went back and picked up his bundle of meat , carrying scalp and bundle in one hand . The Mandan pulled in , so close they could hop aboard . Jourdonnais ' bold , dark face questioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their eyes big and watchful like the eyes of a frog ready to jump if a man took another step . Summers said , " We put one under and winged two . " The barrel of his rifle swung toward Boone . " There 's a hoss as 'll shoot plumb center . " In tones that Boone barely overheard he went on , " We ai n't seen the last of ' em , I 'm thinkin ' . "  |p114ummers  was right ; but for a day and part of another , whilethey went by the Riviere a Jacques and headed on toward the L'Eau Qui Court , Jourdonnais told himself that he was n't . There was n't one sign of Indian , not even to Summers , who watched the shores , hour after hour , searching with his trained gray eye . Summers ' face was sober but not worried . Jourdonnais wondered if he ever worried , this big , loose-built man who was like a wise old dog . Watching him , gazing down from his place at the steering oar , Jourdonnais wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't care for money or a nice house or pretties for a wife , if he had one . He lived like a wild thing , to eat and frolic and keep his scalp , not thinking from one day to another , not puttingby against the future . If Jourdonnais had n't found him fresh back from a good hunt in the country of the Arapahoes , Summers would n't have had money to put into cargo , the way he was spendingit . As it was , Jourdonnais in his desperate need for funds had had to beg , holding out the possibilities of rich profits in the Trois Fourches . Looking at Summers , seeing the alert face that was untroubledby regrets or ambition , Jourdonnais thought that Summershad joined him for the fun rather than the profit . He was glad that Summers was an easy man , without the dark strain of violence that ran so often in mountain men . He was thankful , too , for the favor of the wind , grudging and unreliable as it was . It would take a gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would n't order them to tow unless he had to . A hundred Indians could hide in one small thicket and kill the crew to the last man as they pulled up to it . It was good that the river was down . The time was coming on to June , and the Missouri would flood again when the snow in the mountains ran off . As much as he could , Jourdonnais kept the Mandan to the left bank , away from the side on which Summers and Caudill had come up against the Indians . Sometimes he put the crew out with the cordelle on the long sand bars that divided the current , lying in the water like the backs of hogs cooling off in the muck . The men rowed , each with a rifle by his side , and for all of Summers ' looking , they looked , too , putting only half their attention on the oars andp115the other half on the bank , as if every bush hid an Indian . SometimesJourdonnais felt ashamed for his people , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go away , eh , Summers ? " Summers came over and leaned against the cargo box and gave a half-shake of his head . " They 're like to pop up on a bank any time and rain arrers down on us . Now 's when we need two boats , one on each side , the other lookin ' out for us and us lookin ' out for them . We can see the far shore a heap better'n this one . I 'm thinkin ' they 're comin ' along , maybe lookin ' for a way acrost . " The hunter looked down from his six feet and said something in Indian to little Teal Eye , who was standing by her lodge with one hand on the box letting the breeze blow her . She answered and let her gaze slide back to the shore . " You sure about Sioux ? " Jourdonnais asked . " They make no trouble for long time . " Summers ' tone had a faint edge . " This child ought to know a Sioux . " Jourdonnais agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have sleep with them enough ? Maybe beaucoup Sioux babies by Summers ? " The hunter did n't answer at once , and when he did speak it was to explain . " Sioux or what , two white men alone make Injuns itchy . " " So ? " " They had blood in their eye to boot , I 'm thinkin ' . " He pointedto the scalp that had been tucked under a lashing , raw side up , to dry . A big blue-green fly , shining with bloat , was working on it . " Hair 's cut short . Means that hoss was grievin ' . " " Yes . " " Injuns ai n't never so mean as when they 've took a beatin ' . They 're half-froze to make up for it , do n't matter on who . " They pulled up to a sand bar for the night . The river ran on both sides of it , making an island  --  a flat little island on which the willows had commenced to poke up . It might wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the willows and picked up the sand and threw it at them , so that there was sand in the eye and in the meat and in the beds . Pambrun had set up his stove onp116top of the cargo , in a box filled with sand . Here in the middle of the river the Creoles felt safe . Some of them took off their clothes and sported in the water . That was one thing about his people , Jourdonnaisthought ; they had the light heart . He let himself have one of the Spanish segars that he reserved for special occasions , though he hardly felt right in smoking it . A man could keep himself poor , letting small money get away from him . " By damn , " he said to Romainewhile he wiped an eye , " the wind blow the gnat off and the sand on . One damn thing or another . " As the night began to close down Pambrun set out his fishlines , baited with bird gut . They stood watches that night and went on before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roast liver and tenderloin that was half-raw and tough but full of strength . Great yellowbreastedlarks sang as the sun came up , and with his fowling piece Summers shot half a dozen prairie hens that had watched them from an island , their heads up and turning until the bird shot knocked them over . There was no wind at all in the early morning , and the river seemed to have a new strength , as if it had just awakened to find how far they had invaded her . The absence of a breeze , the renewed force of the current , the Indians maybe somewhere along the bank , all seemed to Jourdonnais , squirming at the helm , the proof of conspiracyagainst him . Enfant de garce , was n't the river easier above the Jacques , always ! He thought of distance as the enemy , as a slow and crawling thing that stood between him and a new house and money in pocket and the big men of St. Louis saying " Monsieur Jourdonnais . " The left bank lay open , inviting him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cordelle ? " He was asking for advice . He motioned toward the bare bank . Summers ' chin closed , so that his mouth was the thin mouth of thought . " Put in , " he said at last . " This child 'll scout . See me wave , send the crew out . " He lifted his gun that seemed always in his hand now and refreshed the priming . " Better send a hunter with ' em , to boot . " Before he started for the shore he studied it . " All right . " Jourdonnais saw that they had scared up a heron , which flopped away with its legs out , using them for a rudder . It seemed a long time before he saw Summers again , standingp117half a mile up on a little tongue of land , motioning them on . Jourdonnaissaid , " The cordelle . We tow , " loud enough for the oarsmen in the bow to hear him . The men 's eyes went to the bank and then to him . They got themselves up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Non ! Not the guns . Mon Dieu , you think to pull with rifles in the hands ? " They stood shifting from foot to foot , muttering to themselves . " Summers , he 's looking ahead . I send Caudill with you , to lead . Here , all have a drink . It is all right . " The woods were still , but not too still . Things moved in them and made noises , a brown thrush flitting in a thicket of buffalo berry , a coyote trotting at the edge of the meadow that flowed out from the trees and led on up to the hills , a bunch of magpies cawingin a tangled cottonwood . Summers ' eye caught the movement of the thrasher . It was no more than a shadow passing in shadows , but he saw it and identified the bird , and his eye climbed the bushes until it found the nest . The magpies were a brood . The young ones made an unsure clamor , like boys with their voices changing . Summers went on , letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it open for the messages of the woods . A man had to learn how to divide his mind that way , to think and remember in some far-off part of it and yet to note and feel what was going on about him , and to be ready to act without thinking . The far-off part of his mind saw Caudill aiming at the Indian , his face set and maybe a little pale but not scared . Caudill , for all he was an odd and silent boy , would make a mountain man . Maybe so would Deakins , though he did n't seem cut out so clear for it . Trading would suit him ; he got along with people . It was something , what traders would do to make money  --  like Jourdonnais stewing over his nickels . Christ , even when you had a heap of beaver what did you have ? He went to the water line and motioned an " All right , " waiting for Jourdonnais ' answering wave , and then let the woods swallowhim again and that far piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was n't a mountain man as some men were . He liked to get to St. Louis once in a while and sleep in a sure-enough bed , with a white woman that smelled of perfume instead of greasep118and diamond-willow smoke . He did n't mind farming , too much . It was still getting outside . And he had n't lost his taste for bread and salt and pies and such . They were a heap better than squaw meat , which men had been known to butcher and eat , probably after bedding with the squaws first . Above him , out at the edge of the brush , a curlew was calling . Its sharp two-toned cry seemed to hang in the air . He caught a glimpse of it , with its wings outspread and just the tips of them fluttering as it glided . He waited for it to land , waited for the muted little trill that would tell him it was aground again and satisfied . The bird 's shadow sped along the leaves over his head . It had n't lighted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept sounding , as if something had stumbled on the nest . Summers waited and watched and after a while moved ahead again , going as softly as a man could . Except for the curlew and the magpies that were half a mile behind him now , the woods had no voice at all , and no movement . He came to a small open space and stood at the edge of it , unmoving except for his eyes . Through a  --  screen of brush he could see a patch of the river shaded by the trees above him . The water seemed still as pond water , gathered in a small elbow in the bank . While he watched , a mallard hen came into the patch , swimming steadily downstream , watching for the string of ducklings that trailed behind her . They did n't make a sound . Summers thought , " Injuns about , sure as God , " but still he did n't move . A man could n't run off yelling Injun without knowing where they were and who and how many . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and went on . A willow branch made a littlewhisking noise along his buckskin . He halted and put it back of him and waited again . The curlew was still circling , still crying about her nest . The boats were stowed carefully in the brush , so as not to be seen from the river . There were seven of them in sight , the round bullboats of the upper Missouri , each made from the hide of a singlebull stretched over a willow frame . They appeared old and were wet yet , but not dripping , as if they had been used the night before and had n't had time to dry out there in the shade . Summers looked at them through a clump of low willow . He made out a moccasined track pointed upstream.  |p119After  what seemed a long time , he crouched down and sidled over toward the bank of the river . He thrust his head from the brush slowly , like a squirrel peeking from behind a limb , knowing it was movement and not shape that caught the eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , the river made a slow turn . The willowsgrew lush there , probably where a tree had gone over and caught the sand and made a bank . The boat towers would have clear going until they got there . Summers could n't see anything among the willows , not so much as a branch bent out of shape or the grass trampled where a man might have gone through , but he knew the Sioux were there . He brought his head back , still slowly , and turned about , to see an Indian screened in the brush only an arm 's length away . Two black stripes ran down the Indian 's cheeks . They pulled downwardas the Indian caught his movement . There was one still instant  --  aflash of seeing , in which nothing moved or sounded  --  and then the Indian jerked up his battle-ax . Summers leaped to one side , hearing the empty whistle of the club before it thrashed the brush . There was n't room or time for the rifle . Summers dropped it and leaped ahead , straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat the second swing of the club . The Sioux grunted and went down over a root , chopping with the bladed club as he fell . Summers felt the point of it stabbing his left shoulder . He got hold of the hand . His right hand went down for his knife . The Indian gave a sudden heave , snapping himself at the crotch . They rolled over , Summers underneath now , hugging the Indian to cramp his swing . He knew he ought to call out , to warn the crew oncoming with the cordelle . He felt the Indian 's legs on either side of his knee and jerked the knee up . The force of it pounded the Indian ahead . The Indian let out a grunt that settled into a thin whine . Summers got his knife then , got it out and around and brought it down , feeling it hit and skid and go on . The Indian flopped from him and lay straining and got himself on his butt and sat , unable to do more . Summers was on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knife in it . The Sioux 's fingers lay loose around the handle of his tomahawk . Summers thought his eyes were like a dog 's , like a pitiful goddam dog 's . He had to let him have it . The eyes followed Summers '  |p120arm  up to the knife , waiting for it to come down . The far-off part of Summers ' mind told him again he was n't a real mountain man . Eyes like a goddam hound 's . The knife went in easy this time . Summers wrenched himself around and lurched through the brush to the shore . He could feel his shirt sticking to his back . The boatmen strung along the cordelle pulled up , their mouths dropping open , as he burst out almost on top of them . He made himself be deliberate . " Back ! " he said . " Quick , but be careful ! " He heard the Indians begin to shout behind him , from the clustered willow . Their arrows made a small fluttering noise , and their fusils boomed . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powder , " while he shouted at the Creoles , trying to put order in their flight . They had turned like sheep and started to run and fallen down and run again and fallen , as the fleeter overran the others . He was shouting , more to himself than to them , " Easy ! You French sons of bitches . " An arrow was sticking from Labadie 's arm , but it did n't stop his running . It just made him yell . Christ , a man would think it had him in the heart ! The Indians shouted louder , but not from the willow any more and not like men standing still . Summers could hear them breaking through the brush , their cries broken by the jolt of their feet . The Creoles were a frantic tangle down the bank . Closer , Caudill stood , his dark eye fixed along the rifle barrel , and behind him was Deakins , unarmed but waiting . " Hump it ! " cried Summers , humping it himself . The Mandan lay like a dead duck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and useless as a broken wing . Free from the towline , she was settling back with the current and pulling out , drawing away from them . While Summers watched , he saw Romaine splash into the water and run up on the bank and take a snub on a tree , and then splash back to the Mandan as if the devil was on his tail . " Go on ! " shouted Summers . " Hump it , you goddam fools ! " Caudill 's rifle went off almost in his face , and then they were running at his sides , Caudill and Deakins were , running and lookingback . An arrow whizzed over their heads and buried its head in a tree before them . A rifle spoke again , sounding as if it had been fired right behind their heads . " Goddam it , run , you boys ! " Summersfelt his legs playing out on him . His head was dauncy , as if it was n't fixed rightly to his neck . All of a sudden he realized he wasp121old . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sleeping dogs of the years and now at last they had wakened all at once and seized on him . He knew he could n't make it . " Git on , you two , " he panted . Back of him he could see the Indians , running in the open now and yelling their heads off , sure that they would get him . And then the swivel spoke . The black smoke belched out of it , cored at first with fire , and hung in a black cloud , tattering at the edges as the air played with it . The shot silenced the yells of the Indians and the footsteps . When Summers looked back he could n't see a Sioux , except for two that lay there for the wolves . After a while , above the slowed sound of his own moccasins , he heard them again , but thin this time and lost in the brush . He called to Jourdonnais . " Let 's move on up and get them scalps . They 'll help a heap with the Rees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a night sky shot with stars . They were sharp and bright as fresh-struck flames , like campfires that a traveler might sight on a far shore . Starlight was nearly as good as moonlight here on the upper river where blue days faded off into nights deeper than a man could believe . By day Boone could get himself on a hill and see forever , untilthe sky came down and shut off his eye . There was the sky above , blue as paint , and the brown earth rolling underneath , and himself between them with a free , wild feeling in his chest , as if they were the ceiling and floor of a home that was all his own . Boone had his shirt close around his neck and a handkerchief half over his face to shut off the mosquitoes . They made a steady buzzing around his head , for all that he and Jim had built a smudge and bedded down close to it . He could hear Jim slapping his face and rubbing the itch afterwards . " Worse'n chiggers , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em . It 's their war whoop they 're singing . " Boone set his mind to listening . The whole night seemed filled with the small whining of their wings . " What 's the good of a gnat , anyways ? " Jim asked  | " They 'll quiet down some , if it cools off . " " They do n't serve no purpose , unless to remind a man he ai n't such a somebody . " " I du n no , " said Boone , knowing Jim was turning the question in his mind as he did with everything . When it came to an idea Jim was like Boone with a rock or a buffalo chip , tipping it over to see what was underneath . Boone figured it was better to take what came and not trouble the mind with questions there was no answer to . Under a rock or a chip , now , a man could spot bugs and sometimes a snake . " Maybe the pesky little bastards is asking themselves what God wanted to put hands on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maybe they 're thinkin ' everything would be slick , except their dinnercan slap ' em . Maybe , " he went on after another pause , " maybe they got as much business here as we have . You reckon ? " " I would n't say as much . " " They 're here , ai n't they ? " Jim 's hand made a whack against his cheek . " And we 're here , ready for ' em to feed on . I bet they figure we 're made special just for them . I bet they 're sayin ' thank you , God , for everything , only why did You have to put hands on a man , or a tail on a cow ? " Boone could look down along the shadows of his cheeks and see the Mandan 's mast , standing sharp and black . " Or maybe they 're sayin ' , like my old man would , we know it 's a punishment for our bein ' so sinful and no-account . Forgive us our trespasses , an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be part of a man , like his pants or his shoes . Only Boone did n't have shoes any more , but moccasins bought from the squaws . Everybody was dressed like an Injun now , or half like one , with long hair and moccasins and hunting shirts and some of them leather leggings . Even his hair and Jim 's , shaved off away down on the Platte , was beginning to come around the ears . He could make tails , almost , from the tufts they had left . He had got himself a slick outfit , trading glass beads that Jourdonnaishad put up against his pay and a turkey tail that Summers had given him . It was something , the store the upper Injuns set by turkey tails to make headpieces with . Summers said it was because you did n't see turkeys , leastwise not very often , above Little Cedarp123Island . His outfit had been made by the Crows , the Mandans said , and had quills on it and some beads . A man could cut a figure in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Jim , he thought about home and Bedwell and the sheriff and the horse he had stolen and sold at St. Louis . Mostly , though , when he thought about things like that , he thought about home . Not that he wanted to go back . God 's sake , no ! Still , a man wondered about his ma and brother . And if he had it to do over again , he would n't be scared of Pap . He could handle Pap now , all right , even if he was still just seventeen . He had got on to a lot in a mighty little while . He brought his left hand over and felt the muscle of his arm . He could pick Pap up and shake his teeth loose without so much as taking a long breath . When he thought about leaving home and the tears coming into his eyes and the lump aching in his throat , he wondered if he was still the same body . It would take something to make him cry now . It would take something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had worried when he found he 'd caught a case of clap . Summers was right ; a thing like that kind of wore out after a while , and a man got so he did n't give it any heed . It seemed like a year he 'd been with the boat . Like his whole life . A body lost track of time . One day melted into another , passing into full summer and beyond , and no one took note or cared except Jourdonnais and maybe Summers a little , and even Jourdonnais was smiling , for it was as if the wind that had deviled them for so long suddenly had got ashamed of itself . Past the Ponca country it had switched around . Day after day it had kept behind them , pushingthem along , turning when they turned as if it was trained to it , getting ornery only once in a while and pretty soon giving up and working with them again . Jourdonnais shook his head , saying one time after another , " I never know it like this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had passed a sight of country . It ran through Boone 's eyes as he eased off toward sleep , as if he were seeing it for the first time again : the hills changing , some of them as flat as a table and others undercut and weathered off , looking like old forts or fancy places that kings had lived in long before ; the wild currants and cherries and gooseberries above the White , where Carolina pigeons whooed and blackbirds rasped ; islands runp124around with cedar or cottonwood , with little , secret meadows inside ; the black veins striping the river bluffs , which Summers said was coal and sometimes caught fire , making the pumice stone that the river carried and that the squaws used to finish hides ; dead Indianslying on scaffolds and some of them falling to pieces and litteringthe ground , making a stink , and the buzzards sitting in the trees around ; Summers lying above the Big Bend with a handkerchiefflying from a stick and an antelope dancing and circling and coming closer , out of curiousness , until Summers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prairies and prairies and alwaysthe strange hills and the big sky . Jourdonnais stood at the wheel , steering right by Fort Tecumseh , which belonged to the Company and hung to a bank the river was undercutting . He let the men answer the welcoming shots on the shore with a volley from half a dozen muskets , but steered on by just the same , the sail full and the flag whipping from the mast , while he looked dead ahead as if his mind was on trouble . The hills were easy and wooded at the mouth of the Cheyenne , and farther on cottonwood and a few elms and small ashes and buffalo berry and currant bushes made a lane for them . They saw elk  --  thirty of them in one bunch  --  and white wolves chasing along the bluffs , and once Boone and Summers and Jim came on a little place fenced in with poles , which had a post in the center painted with fading red and a buffalo head raised on a small mound of earth . Summers said it was medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarred high by the ice that had gone out in the spring , and beaver cuttings and beaver tracks galore . Summers looked hungrily at the sign , and explained that hunters let this country be because the Rees claimed it for their own . The Ree villages sat round-topped on the west bank , the two divided by a stream and each closed in by a fence of stakes that had commenced to rot and fall down . The houses were made of reddishwhiteclay and each had a square hole in it for a door . And beyond the villages were the Cannonball and the Heart , and buffalo , poundingover the high ground , making knee-deep paths along the bluffs , swimming in the river . Summers killed a cow with a knife , jumping in the river and swimming to her and running the blade around her throat as she hit shore . How much fresh meat could a man eat ? It went into the stomach and spread right out into blood and strength , leaving the belly ready for more . Summers shot a deer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , larger than the other and darker , with ears almost like a jackass . It was young and juicy , and the head that had been buried in the coals made Boone 's mouth water , just thinking . The river went on , to the Mandans , to the Minitari , to the Knife River , to the Little Missouri , the brown never-ending river , idling and tearing and twisting and gouging , the river that ran full of silt and drift and rotting buffalo , leading up from the deep woods and the closed hills and the scrub grass of the down country to country that kept getting freer and bigger until sometimes , looking out over it from a rise , Boone felt he was everywhere on it , like the air or the light . " Goddm , Jim ! " he said . " What ? " " It 's slick , ai n't it ? " " What ? " " This here . Everything . " " These pesky gnats  --  " Jim 's words got mixed with Boone 's remembering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the Ree camp . It was n't dark yet , not so dark a man could n't see , but the boatmen and the squaws did n't care . In the open grass behind the clay huts they made moving heaps , the men writhing over the squaws , rising and pushing and writhing and sometimes groaning like a stud horse as the stuff of them pumped out . Once in a while you heard a giggle from a squaw or a Frenchie , before they settled down to business . The dusk was thick and soft , like smoke you could n't smell . Boone could hear the old squaws quarreling in their houses and the barkingof the wolf-dogs that showed their teeth to white men , but they seemed far away , like echoes running across a stillness . Here there was just the single voice in a laugh or the throat in a groan and the grass rustling . By and by other boatmen would be coming along with their squaws . It was early yet . Boone 's squaw lifted her gown and sat down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hugging or hunting with the hand . It was n't that a man needed any , not with what was going onp126around him , and the heart big and urgent in the throat . The squaw lay waiting , thinking likely about the scarlet cloth her man had bargained for and taken only after he had gone back to her to ask if it was enough . She was n't bad  --  straight and young and so lightcoloreda man might take her for white in the dusk . The smell of her came into his nostrils as he got down , the smell of lodge smoke and warmth and meat grease and woman and the smell of bruised grass . Afterwards he got up without a thank-you or a how-de-do , walking with the loose , easy fag of a man who had spent himself . There were a passel of dogs in the village and more blind people than a body would think for . He met Summers . The hunter 's eyes studied him . " This child was n't lyin ' , was he , about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but still good . The Rees are movin ' . " " Sioux , mostly . The Sioux keep pressin ' them . Likely they 'll join up with the Pawnees . They 're kin . " " They been oncommon friendly for folk you did n't trust . " " On account of the Sioux scalps , and on account of this nigger hisself . They remember me all right . Some calls me brother , from away back . " Summers gave tobacco to two who came begging . " They 're tricky , though , remember , and mean fighters . Meanest next to the Blackfeet , I do believe . Watch careful , or might be they 'll take our hair . " " I 'm bein ' careful . " " I 'm makin ' talk with Two Elks . Want to come ? Best to have a little ' baccy . " " I got a lookin ' glass , too . " Buffalo robes were already spread around a small fire in the lodge they entered . An Indian put out his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he filled a pipe . A squaw began to busy herself with a kettle , waddling to the fire like an old duck . Two Elks lighted his pipe and blew smoke to the sky and earth and the four directions . Holding the bowl , he passed the long stem to Summers and then to Boone . By the light of the fire the squaw had poked , Boone could see the white and welted line of the scar that ran along each of his arms and came together on his naked stomach.  |p127The  vermilion on his cheeks was like streaks of old blood . His hair was heavy and longer than a man could believe . It came down from the sides of his head in plaits and lay in coils at his thighs like snakes . In the pot that the squaw had fixed was a mixture of dried corn mixed with beans and cooked with buffalo marrow . It tasted good to Boone , putting him in mind of Ma and the garden in Kentucky . Two Elks said , " How , " and waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man making a speech , talking deep in his throat . His eyes were small and deep-set . The little fire shone in them , behind the close banks of the lids . The squaw came to Summers and studied his buckskins piece by piece . She took an awl and a piece of split sinew from a bag and went to work on a rip in his moccasin . Two Elks kept talking . " The heart of Two Elks is full , " Summers translated as the Indian paused . " His brothers , the Long Knives , have brought the scalps of the Sioux who are as many as the blades of grass , whose tongues are crooked and whose hearts are bad . While the pale brother makes war on the Sioux , the Rees will walk with him . " The fire made a ball of light in the darkness , a red bubble closing in Two Elks and his squaw and Summers and Boone . Outside there was only darkness , and sounds that came muted  --  the growl of a dog , a snatch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh of a boatman out in the grass . The chief spoke again , and Summers translated . " Two Elks is a poor man . He has given his goods to others , for it is below a brave man to want riches . He is very poor and needs what the white brother can give him . What he has , his brothers may have , too . " Summers reached for the powder horn at the Indian 's side and held it to the fire to see how full it was . It took most of Summers ' horn to fill it . Boone handed over a twist of tobacco and the looking glass he had brought along in case he needed it with a squaw . Then , because they looked so little , he took some balls from his pouch . Summers talked with his hands and mouth . The Indian sat back listening , his eyes steady on the hunter 's face , sometimes nodding and sometimes just looking through his narrowed lids . To Boone Summers said , " I told him I heerd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it was not true , that I had lived with the Rees and slept in their lodges and hunted with their hunters , and we were brothers . I said we brought the scalps of the Sioux and some presents , too , to show our hearts were good . " The squaw 's hands picked at Boone , looking for a loose thread or a tear . Her fingers lingered on the boughten shirt he wore , which was red-checked cotton and faded with the sun , and pretty soon began to tug at it while her eyes looked into his . After a while he took the shirt off and gave it to her . She made a pleased sound . Afterwardsshe barely brushed his head and jaw with her fingers as if to make out what he was . He sat still , trying not to notice her , as he reckoned a man was supposed to do . The chief pointed to the robes they sat on , to show they were gifts . The squaw left the circle of firelight , clucking over the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard again the sounds that came from the rutting back of the village . One voice rose high , a Frenchman 's , speaking through a bubbling of laughter . Two Elks heard and leaned forward , his elbows outspread on the knees that slanted up from his crossed legs . His eyes were direct and asking , and his old face in the firelight seemed as open as a child 's . His voice came out in a question , which Summers seemed not to understand , for he said something short and Two Elks asked again . Summers looked puzzled but nodded his head and spoke . Two Elks ' gaze went down to the fire and thought made a cloud on his face . He was silent , as if trying to figure something out . A dog was barking at the edge of the village . He set off the others until there was nothing but the sound of dogs out in the night . When they quieted the other sounds took up . By listening close Boone could hear voices in other lodges , where Jourdonnais @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could still hear the sounds out in the grass behind , coming through the clay of the lodge . " Two Elks do n't understand , " said Summers . " He wants to know , ai n't there any squaws in the land of the Long Knives ? " As long as he lived , thought Boone as he squirmed for comfort on the ground , he would remember that question and Two Elks ' open face asking it . " No squaws in the land of the Long Knives ? " In a way it was so simple it made a man want to laugh . Jim snored lightly , fallen away from his thoughts . Jim alwaysp129seemed to go to sleep quick , and to wake up feeling good , with a glint in his eye . The campfire was a dying glow in the night . Across it Boone could see other figures , lying loose and all spraddled out as if the touch of the ground rested them . Most of them made noises in their sleep , sucking in their breath and blowing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would be Boone 's turn next , and then Jim 's . Jourdonnais and Summers always took the earlymorningwatches , figuring they were the dangerous ones . Romaine went over by a tree and stood there a minute and then let himself down , his back against the trunk . It was a mighty poor way to stand guard . After a while he began to tip over , a little at a time , like a bag not set quite right . Boone knew he was asleep . Except for the men 's breathing and the river forever talking to itself along the shores , there was hardly a sound tonight , bar the coyotes that sang at the sky . A man could n't tell where a coyote was from his singing . His voice came from the hills somewhere , sharp-pitched and sorrowful , and threaded through the night like a needle . Closer , he heard the sound of a wing as a bird settled itselfbetter for the night . Boone lay on his side with his eyes half-open , looking down toward the Mandan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking and thinking and trying to drop into sleep . He saw himself shooting the white bear , and the bear turning as if to bite the ball out and falling and loosening away into death and Summerslooking at him and smiling . Sometimes bears sneaked into camps , looking for a piece of meat or a lick of sweetening . For a moment , through his widened eyes , Boone thought it was a bear he saw , waddling slow and quiet toward the boat . His hand went over to waken Jim , but Jim had rolled out of reach . Romaine was lying as flat as anyone now and as sound asleep . Boone felt for his rifle . He sat up , holding the weapon in his hands . The figure lengthened from its crouch as he looked and framed its upper part in the star shine of the river , and he saw it was a man , working down easy toward the keelboat . Boone brought his gun up and ran his eye along it , and then he thought about Teal Eye in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapon down . He rolled from his bed and started ahead on all fours , hearing his heart thump in his chest . It was an Indian  --  a tee , maybe , or a Sioux , or a Blackfoot . There 'd be others with him ,  |p130though  . He halted and hunted with his eyes , but saw no one except the man creeping to the boat . He was of a mind to let out a shout or to crawl to Summers and wake him up . For all he knew , though , the man was just one of the Frenchies . That was it  --  a Frenchie sneaking up on Teal Eye , going against the orders that Jourdonnais had given out many 's the time . Goddam , a man would think they 'd had enough for a spell ! He 'd learn him . He crawled faster , less careful now of making noise . The man inched along like sneaking on a goat and only one bullet to his name . Boone put his rifle aside , stood up and jumped . His weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got his forearm under the neck and up on the other shoulder and levered the man 's chin up , straining the neck bones while he held him flat on his stomach with his weight . The man was hitting behind himself with his right hand . The knife in it ran hot along Boone 's thigh . He grabbed for the hand , and they rolled over , making a crackle among the dead twigs . The camp came to life all at once as Summerslet out a whoop . Boone heard shouts and moving feet , and the crack of a gun stock against bone . " That 'll tame him . " Boone had the wrist in his hand . The two hands , his and the man 's , made a wide circle . The man quit wrenching of a sudden and got his butt up and bucked like a horse , trying to free himself . Boone hung to a handhold on his hair as he would have hung to a mane . Another pair of hands worked on the arm . " You can let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Summers . Pambrun had kicked the fire into life . The crew was milling around it . Summers had Boone 's man by the seat of his pants and the scruff of his neck . He pushed him into the firelight like a man pushing a boy . " Now , by Jesus , we 'll make out what kind of a varmintyou are ! Bring t'other'n , Jourdonnais . " The man said , " Son of a bitch , " and Summers cuffed him on the back of the neck with his fist . Jourdonnais and Romaine came dragging another man , Jourdonnaissaying sharply , " You ' ave the nice sleep , I hope , Romaine , " and Romaine answering , " For a minute only . Mon Dieu , a man gives out . " They let the second man fall on his face in the dirt . Summers was tying the other up with a length of hide . He was a small man ,  |p131dressed  in skins and with his hair in three plaits , but a white man for all that . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned about , first one way and then another , as if to find something to bite . His eyes were small and wicked . The man lying on his face was coming to . He got his elbows under him and pushed up and rolled over on his butt . His eyes looked around , at the bound man by his side , at Jourdonnais and Summers and the crew gathered about . A slow understanding came into them . He rubbed his head where the gun stock had clubbed it . He looked at the hunter , and a little smile worked at his mouth . " Dick Summers . Heap time no see . " " You want a kiss ? " " We had a awful dry . We was tryin ' to scout up a drink . " Summers said , " Snake shit ! " He had another length of hide in his hands . " All back to bed ! " Jourdonnais yelled . " The party she 's done for now . In the morning she goes on again . We see about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caudill , we mend the scratch , with balsam and heaver . " True to his word , Jourdonnais waited for dawn . Then , as the light came up in one big streamer he walked over to the two visitors . Summers had untied them , and they sat rubbing their wrists and ankles . Boone squirmed up , feeling the shallow cut on his leg pull with his movement , and went over and sat down by Jourdonnais . He saw Deakins open his blue eyes and flop over on his belly to watch . The men were stirring , getting up and stretching and chafing their beards with the heels of their hands . They lounged over within earshot . Pambrun was striking another fire , away from the dead ashes in front of the two men , nearer the shore . Already the mosquitoes were making little clouds around each man . Jourdonnais said , " Now , by the good God , you tell us . " He had a pistol in his hand . Summers sat at his side , his rifle across his knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . The bigger man spoke . " I told you , Frenchy . We was lookin ' for a drink . We was tryin ' to wet our dry . " He had a head that bulged above the temples and came in and went out again , like the body of an ant . There was a bruise at the hairline where Summersp132had hit him . The little inquiring smile still curved the corners of his mouth . " Tell the sons of bitches nothin ' , " said the smaller man out of the sharp face that seemed made for smelling . When Boone looked at him closer he was put in mind of a rattlesnake . The man had the same poisonous set of eye . When he talked it was like a snake striking . " I 've told ' em all . " " For a little , " said Jourdonnais , wagging the pistol , " for a very little , I pull the trigger . " " No , you wo n't , Frenchy , " the bigger man said . His gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis , sure as hell 's afire . They 'd raise your license and maybe stretch your neck . " He put his head to one side , as if the hangman 's rope were pulling it . " You 're too smart for that , Frenchy . Think you could close all these mouths ? The boys do n't love you that much , Frenchy . " The smaller man snapped , " The Vide Poche bastard ! Let 's up and go . " " Not until we 're ready and damn good and ready . " It was Summers , talking soft . Jourdonnais said , " You come from the new fort , Union  --  yes ? " Boone could see the smiling man was thinking fast . " Yes , from there , but not for them . " " Zeb Calloway 's there , Summers ; he 's a hunter for the fort . " Summers ' glance flicked to Boone . " McKenzie , he sent you , n'est-ce-pas ? " " No , we came on our own hook , I told you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little man asked . " McKenzie , " Summers said , " is the nigger that sent you here , to cut the boat loose or fire it , one , while we was asleep . " " You 're an all-knowin ' son of a bitch . Why 'd you ask ? " Summers got up , took a step forward , seized the little man by his long hair and pulled him up . The man fought like a cat . Summersheld him , waiting , and then hit him with his right fist , so hard a man would think it broke his neck . The little man thumped full length on his back and lay still , the teeth in his sharp snoot showinglike a dead squirrel 's . " Your friend did n't have no mother , I 'm thinkin ' , to teach him else but cuss words . "  |p133The  other man shrugged , appearing hardly to notice . Summers said , " This child can give you some of the same , Long Face , if it 'll make you shine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's froze for a drink he 's like to do anything . " " Like cuttin ' a boat loose or settin ' it afire ? " " Like raisin ' a keg , or even a jug . " Jourdonnais fanned at the mosquitoes . " We can make them tell , " he half-whispered . " So many ways to make the talk come , if a man know how . Fire , or water , or rope , or maybe the live snake . " Jourdonnais and Summers waited , watching the man 's face . The smile was still on it . The little man closed his mouth . By and by he moved and got himself up to a sitting position again . The aide of his mouth was swollen , and a little trickle of blood worked down from it . " Ai n't no call for it , Jourdonnais , " Summers said . " What ? " " We know , by God . This is Company doin 's . They ai n't wantin ' us to horn in . " Suddenly Boone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trouble in his face and his carefulwords , " Take care , my friend , of Indians , and other things , too . " " You would let them go ? " Jourdonnais asked . " You 're comin ' close . Let ' em go , but without the horses they came on and without guns or knives or flint . " " Yes ? " asked Jourdonnais , for Summers ' tone showed he was n't through . " And with nary stitch of clothes . Rich doin 's for the sting flies and such . " " Yes , " said Jourdonnais with no question in his voice . " How far to Union ? " " Hundred miles and more . " " Far enough for beaucoup bellyful to the gnat . " Summers looked at the two men as he might have looked at dumb brutes . " They 'll git ganted up some , too , carryin ' empty paunches , and like as not have to dodge some Injuns or git their h'ar raised . " " Good . Good . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Out of his broken mouth the little man spit , " You 're some , youp134are , now . Goin ' to fight Union , like a rabbit after a b'ar . We 'll see your scalps , we will , hangin ' in the wind . " " If you get there , little snake , " Jourdonnais said softly . The bigger man studied their faces , and there was only the leavings of a smile on his face now . " We just aimed to raise a drink , " he said . When Boone thought back to the sneak-up on the camp he shook himself to set his senses right , remembering the heat that had come up in him when he thought one of the boatmen was stealing on Teal Eye . She was just a kitten , ten or twelve years at the outside , not truly old enough to interest a man that way . He pushed the thought of her away but still saw her , the face grave , the eyes big and noticing in a face too thin for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman sure enough when she did n't have her blanket folded across her . She put him in mind of some small , soft animal in a cage , watching , always watching , as if she had been taken out of a burrow or a woods into where everything was strange . She was more at home now than she had been , though , and moved around the deck and sometimes came on shore while Jourdonnais watched the men out of his stern black eye . OftenBoone felt her eyes on him and turned and looked at her , and sometimes there was a shadow of a smile on a mouth that was as straight and neat as a good seam , but not thin like a seam . There was some fullness to it that made a man wonder if she knew how to kiss . He had seen Jim Deakins watching her many a time , his blue eyes sharp and his mouth laughing and saying little things , but she hardly seemed to notice . Now that the Mandan had got to the upcountry her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see a known face . One hour after another she looked to right and left , searching the bald hills , until a man almost expected to see her pappy , the chief , come galloping down the slopes with his feathers flying . Or , seeing the eyes watching and the face still and waiting , Boone figured maybeP135there was a hunger in her that the eyes filled , a hunger for the big hare hills and the streams running through the cottonwood and , far off and fair , the blue of a mountain like something a body might see through closed lids when he first laid himself down at night . Even when the smoke from the prairie fires was rolling and the eye could n't see to the tops of the ridges , she still looked . Once , late at night when the moon lay bright on the river , Boone had awakened and made out her head above the side of the keelboat , pointed out where the far flames licked as if the edge of the world was on fire . Summers gestured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " On the top of the hill there . On the rimrock . " A wild creature stood there , gazing down at them from under an arch of horn that seemed too much to carry . " Rocky Mountain sheep , " said Summers . " Bighorn . What the French call a grossecorne . You 'll see a heap of ' em farther up . " Boone and Summers stood on the passe avant . Jim was rowing with the crew , not rowing very hard because a fair wind was pushingthem along . " There 's a galore of ' em beyond the Yellowstone , " Summers went on . " What you ai n't like to see , now , is a white bufller . " " White buffler ? " " It ai n't a buffler , proper , nor a white antelope , neither , though you hear that name put to it and a sight of others . They keep to the high peaks , they do , the tiptop of the mountains , in the clouds and snow . This nigger seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a live one . Not many 's seen a live one . A man has to climb some for that . He does , now . Come a fix in the mountains , I do believe I 'd set out for one . " The sheep turned and made off , walking with little , dainty steps . " He 's got a weight of horn , " Boone said . " There 's them as 'll say he lights on ' em , jumpin ' from the cliffs , but I got doubts . Do n't stand to reason . Likely he chips his horns lightin ' . Sheep meat is good doin 's . " Summers made a fire in his pipe . The boat slid by a thicket in which a catbird was making a racket . It occurred to Boone that they did n't hear the whippoorwill any more at evening . A swanp136whiter than milk paddled ahead of the boat , straining to outdistanceit , swimming with its front out and neck up as if it was proud of itself . It breasted to the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awkward hurry flopped ashore . After the boat had passed , it eased back into the water and got hold of its pride again . The river was low and lazy now , flowing shallow between gray rock ridges that were grained slantwise and gave way here and there to hills that might have been leveled off with a saw . Romaine kept sounding with his stick . At the foot of the slopes buffalo-berry bushesshone like silver and juniper climbed in the rocks . Tongues of land ran out where the river turned , groved with cottonwood that grew from a tangle of undergrowth . " Sooner in the season , " said Summers between puffs on his pipe , " the wild roses are right purty . They pink up nigh the whole shore hereabouts . " The sun was just starting down from overhead when the Mandanreached the Yellowstone , which came in wide and easy , like a man slowing down after his race was won . It looked to be as big as the Missouri . Around its mouth tall cottonwoods grew , their leaves turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willow thickets that buffalo had crowded paths through . It made the Missourilook naked , for here the river flowed through a prairie that rolled on and on , one hill leveling off and climbing to another , as far as the eye could reach . Jourdonnais put to on the point of land between the rivers . He was singing a song under his breath , and when his glance caught Boone 's he smiled , sending the points of his mustache up . " We make ' er , the Roche Jaune . " They stepped to shore and climbed to an easy plain that ran back for two miles or more . " Gin'ral Ashley had his fort on this here tongue between the rivers , " said Summers . " Do n't reckon there 's aught of it left . " Jourdonnais gave everyone a drink . They ate buffalo tongue and marrowbone while a flock of crows quarreled in the woods , and after a while pushed on again , taking it easy , since Jourdonnais for once seemed to have lost his hurry . Boone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zeb , who had led him out here , even if unknowing  --  Uncle Zeb , who did n't like Pap and talked of Injun country like a man under a spell . Hep137could see him in his mind 's eye : the eyes looking out from under their heavy brows and the mouth working under the long nose and the face smiling now and then at him and Dan as they begged him to tell some more . It was a long time since he had seen Uncle Zeb . Still , a growed man did n't change much . He hoped Uncle Zeb would be glad to see him . Against Fort Union the other posts that Boone had seen along the river seemed like hunters ' wigwams . Big square pickets , evened off at the top and shining bright and new , marched around it , fencingin a piece of land a man could set a cornfield in . At the southwest and northwest corners blockhouses stood , broad as a barn , rising high to pointed four-way roofs . Low down on them Boone could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pickets , its tip moving to a flag that rolled and snapped with the wind . The fort was on the north side of the river , maybe fifty feet from the bank , on a prairie that looked to go back for a mile before it came to a ridge of hills . There were a dozen or so Indian lodges pitched back of the fort and beyond them a little bunch of horses grazed . Standing in the stern , Boone heard a noise behind him , and turned to see Teal Eye , her head barely raised over the cargo box , the mouth a little open and the eyes looking . Jourdonnais had moved some boxes around her so 's to shut her from sight while the Mandan was tied up at the fort . Another keelboat lay at the landing place  --  a bigger , fancier one than the Mandan , with a cabin in her and long sweep oars that men would work by walking . While Boone watched , the big gate in the front of the post began to fold open , smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the boom of the cannons sounded . The swivel answered , and the crew shipped oars and got up and took the rifles Jourdonnais had let them have , and fired a raggedvolley . Rifle shots were sounding from the fort , and people were corning from the gate . Jourdonnais was shouting , " All right . Back to the oars . Mon then , you think the Mandan get there by herself ! " He crooked a finger at Boone . " You watch the little one , " he said . " See she stay among the boxes , with the robe thrown over . No one must see . Summers try to tell her , these Rocks , they maybe kill her . And McKenzie , no . He must not find out . You see ? "  |p138Boone  stepped back and put his hand on the head that peeped above the cargo box . She went down willingly , her gaze lingering on him , and he fixed the robe so 's to leave her some air . Afterward , seeing Painter lying stretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heard him go to purring as her hand stroked him . Indians and whites lined the shore  --  what they called Assiniboine , or Rock , Indians , mostly naked from the belly up except for their buffalo robes , and workmen in jeans and cotton shirts and moccasins , and here and there a man in a city suit such as a body would see in St. Louis . Boone 's gaze ran among them , looking for Uncle Zeb . There were n't more than two or three Indians had leggingson ; the rest were barelegged , and most of them barefooted , too . Red and white , they were laughing and talking , ready to give a hand as the Mandan pulled in . Some of the Indians waded out in the water . Boone wondered if he ought to holler if he saw Uncle Zeb , or wait quiet and make himself known when the time came . Uncle Zeb was bound to be about ; Long Face had said he worked for the fort . The Indians looked like Sioux , though a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just hit the shoulders . One buck had it fixed over his forehead and ears like a mane . His eyes looked through it like a rabbit through a bush . He wore a little white leathercap . Their faces were red with vermilion and looked greasy in the bright sun , except for one that was painted as black as any nigger 's . Uncle Zeb would know what the black was for . With their straggly hair and bare feet and such , they looked like a poor bunch . Boone saw two bear-claw necklaces but no beads or shells like the Indians down river decorated their heads with . A few of them had guns and every last one of them carried a bow . The guns had bright yellow nails driven into the stocks and small pieces of red cloth tied on the fixings that held the ramrods . Most of the men carried bird-wing fans and some of them had little decorated sticks in their hair . As Boone 's eyes hunted among them , one buck pulled out the stick and began worrying at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the squaws , who stood back a little , smiling . They had on store-bought clothes , and Boone imagined they were the women that belonged to the white men at the fort . Uncle Zeb was n't in the crowd ; Boone had looked at every face.  |p139The  Indians who had waded out in the water were trying to climb aboard , and Jourdonnais was shouting , " Non ! Non ! Push off them ! Push ! " As the Mandan eased in , a man came out of the gate and walked through the crowd , stepping like God . He wore a dark suit , fresh-ironed , that must have cost a sight of money , and a shirt with ruffles down the front that gleamed white in the sun . " So , " he said , " the Mandan made it . " He had a broad forehead and broad cheeks and a broad chin , Boone saw between spells of shoving Indians from the side , and the hair that showed under his city hat looked soft and black as a crow 's wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Summers said , grunting , " if we can keep the Rocks off . " The broad-faced man turned about and shouted , " Pierre ! Baptiste ! " as if he was used to having people jump when he spoke . McKenzie'shead jerked toward the Mandan . " Keep everybody off . " The two dark-faced men who had come forward trotted up the river bank to a willow clump and came back with long switches in their hands . Jourdonnais said , " Your two men , who ' ave welcome us on the Little Missouri , they be along . Maybe here now . So ? " The men with the switches were laying about with them , driving the Indians back up the shore . The cold eye of McKenzie rested on Jourdonnais without a flicker . " I do n't know what you mean . Come on to the house . " " We thought you would n't be expectin ' us , " Summers put in . Boone stood still in the stern , watching them and watching the robe that covered Teal Eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chance that he might have missed Uncle Zeb after all . Jourdonnais turned back . " No one leave the boat . We be a minuteonly , and then go on . You hear ? Romaine ? " McKenzie said , " Come on , " and he and Summers and Jourdonnaiswalked to the gate and disappeared inside . Jourdonnais ' eyes were busy as they walked through the grounds to the back where the house of the bourgeois stood . The flagstaff rose from the middle of the quadrangle , and near it was ap140cannon , trained on the gate . A half-dozen tepees were pitched nearby , which Jourdonnais supposed belonged to the half-breeds employed by the fort . Along the wall of pickets were houses for clerks and interpreters and engages , and storerooms and workshops and other buildings whose uses he could only guess . Some of them were n't yet completed . Carpenters moved about them , pounding and sawing . Above the beat of the hammers and the clang of a blacksmith 's sledge he heard the cackle of hens and the lowing of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence and the cottonwood rifle walk that ran near its top to the cottonwood home of the bourgeois which looked at them from four real-glass windows . U And everything was big and built with care , indicating money andorganization and fine plans . For a moment , as he entered the door of the large house , Jourdonnais ' spirits sank . How could he , a Vide POehe , succeed against so much , against gentlemen like Monsieur McKenzie , who wore a ruffled shirt and had an air that made men stand back ? His whole venture seemed suddenly mad and hopeless , the picture of himself in St. Louis smoking good cigars and wearing expensive clothes , saying , " Bonjour , Monsieur Chouteau , " and hearing " Bonjour , Monsieur Jourdonnais . Comment allez-vous ? " Jourdonnais shook himself as he went through the door , making himself think again of the rich trade of the Blackfeet and the Mandan loaded with liquor . There was a movement in the room as they entered and then the slow closing of a door , shutting from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motioned them to chairs that were stuffed to rest the butt and back . Summers sat forward , as if he were laying an egg . He had been on the ground too much , sitting cross-legged , to be comfortable in a chair . McKenzie got a bottle and glasses out of a cabinet . It was fine French brandy , so high in spirit that it seemed to evaporate in the mouth . " Now , what was it ? " McKenzie asked . There was a faint clipped quality in his speech , such as Jourdonnais had noted in other Scotsmen . Jourdonnais looked at Summers , wanting him to do the talking . " You know , " answered Summers , his gray eyes unyielding beforeMcKenzie 's stare . " We catched ' em , the freeman  --  leastwise , hep141was free once  --  that the Indians call Long Face , and a hoss with a snoot like a weasel . I never seen him afore . " McKenzie passed Spanish segars while his eyes studied Summersand his strong face kept as blank as a rock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe , if the gnats do n't bleed ' em to death , or the Injuns raise their h'ar . We turned ' em loose like they was horned . " McKenzie said , " I know them . Damned nuisances . Traded in a pack and stayed around . " He turned to Jourdonnais . " You understand , being a bourgeois , what a problem men like that are , hangingaround after their business is done . Nuisances , and a danger , too . " " Yes , monsieur . " Summers said , " Bein ' on your payroll maybe had somethin ' to do with their stayin ' around . " " They were n't on the payroll . " " Like hell ! " McKenzie studied Summers for a long moment . When he spoke , though , it was just to ask them to have another drink . Jourdonnais felt the brandy strengthening him . Feeling it , and seeing Summers sitting there , hard and unimpressed , he straightened , while there edged up in him the stubborn ambition that had brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat loose , or fire it , " he said , making himself look straight into McKenzie 's face . " How do you know ? " Summers answered , " Plain as paint . " McKenzie drank and set down his glass and leaned over toward Jourdonnais . " Look . We know what you plan to do . Naturally , no opposition can come up the Missouri without the American Fur Company knowing about it . We know the Blackfoot country better than you do . It 's our country . We have plans for it . But the time is n't ripe , even for us . And if it is n't ripe for an outfit like ours , how close to ripe do you think it is for you ? " Jourdonnais said , " We pick it green , then . " " You 'll get rubbed out , every one of you  --  killed and scalped and left to rot . You do n't know the Blackfeet . " " We know some things , " Jourdonnais said , thinking of Tealp142Eye , the chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buffalo robe . " We go on . " " Go on , and you 'll go under . " Jourdonnais spread his hands . McKenzie let his voice drop . " You are reasonable men . You know the odds are against you . As reasonable men you 're going to be interested in our proposition . " " What ? " asked Summers . " We 'll buy your cargo , lock , stock , and barrel , and pay you double first cost for it . " " So ? " " And that 's not all . We 'll pay you to take a cargo down , a full cargo  --  packs and buffalo tongues  --  and pay whatever you ask  --  within reason , of course . " Summers glanced at Jourdonnais , as if waiting for him to speak . " I think we go on , " Jourdonnais said slowly . " Goddam it , man , you ca n't do better . " " I think we go on . " " What more do you want ? " " It ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You might as well understand . " " For two to one , and a load back ? What do you expect ? " Jourdonnais spoke slowly . " Four or five to one , maybe more , like the American Fur Company . " " We wo n't average two to one . Four or five to one on one deal , a total loss on another . " He poured brandy into their glasses again . " Still , we go on . " McKenzie drank and sat back while his lips savored the brandy . His gaze went from Jourdonnais to Summers and back to Jourdonnais , but it was as if , instead of them , he looked at thoughts . Jourdonnais was reminded , somehow , of a hunter putting a fresh load in his gun . " You wo n't be fighting the Blackfeet alone , " he said , measuringhis words . " The British at Edmonton House will see that they have plenty of guns , and powder and ball to match . They 'll egg the Indians on and maybe offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " We go on . " McKenzie 's calm gave way suddenly . " You goddam fools ! " The blood climbed his neck and flushed his broad face.  |p143Summers  got up  --  almost lazily , it seemed to Jourdonnais . " You 're a little Jesus here , seems like , but not to us , by beaver ! This nigger 's got a notion to see if you 'll bleed . " McKenzie looked at him , bold and calculating , while the angerdied in his face , leaving it again as blank as a rock . " I 'm sorry , " he said , as if he really was n't . " Sit down . No insult intended . " Summers perched on his chair again , and McKenzie poured brandy . " All right , " McKenzie went on after a pause . " You wo n't sell at any price . You do n't want to talk reason . I have just one more thing to say . We can send a keelboat up , too , and fort up right next to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . " He was studying them again . " Sometimes we do that , taking a loss just to discourage opposition . " " You could , " agreed Jourdonnais , thinking of little Teal Eye , wondering if the fort , big as it was , had such a store of whisky as was on the Mandan . " You could if you have the men for it , " Summers said . " Come one , come all , we 'll go on . " " Very well , " said McKenzie . His tone was short , and it seemed as an afterthought , as something demanded by common politeness , that he added , " You 'll stay the night at the post ? " " Non . We pull up a little an ' keep the crew together . They like whisky too well , and squaws . " " Suit yourself then . " " Zeb Calloway about ? " Summers inquired . " Drunken scoundrel . He 's out for meat . May be back about sundown . " " So 's we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doorway . " We let those two niggers go . Next ones we 'll make wolf meat of . " A polite smile was on McKenzie 's lips . " Next ones will be the Blackfeet , unless you come to your senses . You 'll have your fill of meat making . " He held his hand out to them . As they passed through the grounds and went out the gate Summers said , " Reckon we 're fools not to take his offer . " " Maybe . " " Still , this child ' ud rather be scalped by a Blackfoot than skun by a nabob. "  |p144he  long western sun lay flat on the river and plain . Downthe hills to the northeast a string of pack animals filed , looking black against the summer tan of the bluffs . " Could be that 's Zeb , " Summers said , squinting . " McKenzie said likely he 'd get in afore dark . " He and Jim Deakins and Boone stood behind the fort . The Mandan was moored two miles up river , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested that the three of them come back to the fort to talk to Calloway . " That hoss knows a heap , " he had said to Jourdonnais , " besides bein ' kin to Caudill . I figger I better see him . " A little piece from where they stood a dozen lodges of the Assiniboines , set in a half-circle , pointed at the sky . Once in a while smoke came from one of them , rising from the smoke hole at the top in a thin wisp , as if a man with a pipe was blowing through it . The voices of the Indians , of the men talking and the squaws laughing and squabbling and a baby squalling came clear in the evening air . Dogs nosed around the lodges and sometimesfaced around in the direction of the three white men and barked as if they had suddenly remembered to do something forgotten . " Let 's set , " said Summers , letting himself down to the ground . The pack string snaked down from the hills and headed toward them across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , and another one at its tail . Summers smoked and watched and said presently , " I do believe it 's your Uncle Zeb , Caudill . " It was Uncle Zeb , all right , looking older , and gray as a coon . A man could n't go wrong on that long nose and the eyes that peered out from under brows as bushy as a bird 's nest . Boone wanted to get up and shout hello and go out and give his hand , but something held him in . Summers got to his feet easy , so 's not to affright the mules that were packed high and wide with meat . " H'ar ye , Zeb ? " Uncle Zeb stared out of his tangle of brow like a man sightinga rifle . " How , " he answered , his voice stiff and cracked as a man 's is after a long silence . Then , " This child 'll be a Digger if it ai n't Dick Summers . "  |p145Summers  motioned . " This here 's someone you seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He spit a brown stream over the shoulder of his horse . " So ? " Summers waited , and Uncle Zeb looked at Boone again and said , " Ai n't my pup , I 'm thinkin ' . " " Close , " answered Summers . " Do n't you know your own nephy , old hoss ? " Boone asked , " How you , Uncle Zeb ? " " For Christ sake ! " " I reckon you do n't know me , I 've changed that much . " Uncle Zeb spit again and put his mind to remembering . " One of Serenee 's young'ns , ai n't ye ? " " Boone Caudill . " " For Christ sake ! " Uncle Zeb did n't smile . He sat on his horse , his shoulders slumped and his mouth over at one side , making his face look crooked . A calf was bawling inside the fort as if he had lost his ma . " Stay thar , " Uncle Zeb said at last . " I 'll get shet of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got into slow motion , the heads of the mules jerking as the slack went out of the tie ropes . The rider at the tail was an Indian , or a half-breed anyway . For a bridle he had a long hair rope tied about the lower jaw of his horse . The stirrups of his saddle were made of skin and shaped like shoes . lit stared as he went by , lounging on his horse , with his rifle carriedcrosswise before him . Jim and Summers glanced at Boone . He picked up a blade of grass and tied a knot in it . " It 's a spell since he seed me . " The Assiniboine squaws were playing a game , laughing and squealing as they played . Three bucks passed by , making toward the fort . They stopped on the way to ask for some tobacco . A little sand rat that Summers called a gopher came out of a hole and sat up , straight as a peg . He whistled a thin pipe of a whistle that ' truck the ears like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him , and he dived into his hole and then nosed back up , just his head showing , and the black unwinking eye . The sun had got behind a bank of clouds and painted them blood red . It was like an Indian had spit into a hand of vermilion and rubbed the western sky with it . Boone got out the pipe he had traded for down river . In a little while Uncle Zeb came back , walking stiff and un/even from the saddle . His leggings were black and worn , with no more than a half-dozen pieces of fringe left . He wore an old Indian shirt smeared with blood , which had a colored circle on the chest made of porcupine quills . Instead of a hat he had a red handkerchieftied around his head . He took a bottle out of his shirt and sat down and got the cork out , not saying anything . Summers brought out another bottle . Uncle Zeb passed the first one round , watching it go from hand to hand as if he could hardly wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't buy a drink on'y at night , goddam McKenzie ! " It was getting cold , with the sun low and hid , too cold even for the gnats that like to ate a man alive . A little breeze ran along the ground , making Boone draw into himself . Off a piece he could see some whitened bones , and beyond them some more , and beyond them still more where buffalo had been butchered . Three Indian dogs that looked like wolves except for one that was blotched black and white were smelling around them . The dogs were just bones themselves , with spines that humped up and ran crooked so that the feet did n't set square underneath them . The calf inside the fort was still bawling . As if it did n't make much difference Uncle Zeb asked , " How 's Serenee makin ' out ? " " All right , last I seen her . " Uncle Zeb grunted and lifted the bottle and took a powerful drink . He slumped back , in a mood , as if waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Christ sake ! " and took another drink . Summers said , " This here 's Jim Deakins , crew of the Mandan . " " Pleased to meetcha , " Jim said . Uncle Zeb got out tobacco and stuffed it in his cheek and let it soak . " Why 're you here ? " " I fit with Pap . " " Measly son of a bitch . By God ! If'n you 're any part like him  --  ? " He spit and sucked in his lower lip afterward to get the drop off . " He 's some now , " Summers said . " He 's true beaver . Catched the clap , and fit Indians and killed a white b'ar a'ready . " Uncle Zeb looked at Summers . " Never could figger why my sister teamed up with that skunk , less'n she had to . " He turned . " How old be ye ? " " Comin ' eighteen . "  |p147Uncle  Zeb thought for a while , then said , " You got no cause to be set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goddammed to you ! You take after Pap your own self . " " Sic ' im , Boone ! " It was Jim , looking across at him with a gleam in his blue eye . Uncle Zeb only grunted . He started the bottle around again , taking a swig of it first himself and ending the round with another . " This nigger 's got a turrible dry . " Summers was smiling at the ground as if he was pleased . " Caudilland Deakins , here , aim to be mountain men . " " Huh ! They better be borned ag'in . " " How so ? " " Ten year too late anyhow . " Uncle Zeb 's jaw worked on the tobacco . " She 's gone , goddam it ! Gone ! " " What 's gone ? " asked Summers . Boone could see the whisky in Uncle Zeb 's face . It was a face that had known a sight of whisky , likely , red as it was and swollenlooking . " The whole shitaree . Gone , by God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who seen ' er new . " He took the knife from his belt and started jabbing at the ground with it , as if it eased his feelings . He was silent for a while . " This was man 's country onc't . Every water full of beaver and a galore of buffler any ways a man looked , and no crampin ' and crowdin ' . Christ sake ! " To the east , where the hill and sky met , Boone saw a surge of movement and guessed that it was buffalo until it streamed down the slope , making for them , and came to be a horse herd . Summers ' gray eye slipped from Boone to Uncle Zeb . " She ai n't spoiled , Zeb , " he said quietly . " Depends on who 's lookin ' . " " Not sp'iled ! Forts all up and down the river , and folk everywherea man might think to lay a trap . And greenhorns comin ' up , a heap of ' em  --  greenhorns on every boat , hornin ' in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't they stay to home ? Why' n't they leave it to us as found it ? By God , she 's ours by rights . " His mouth lifted for the bottle . " God , she was purty onc't . Purty and new , and not a man track , savin ' Injuns ' , on the whole scoop of her . " The horses were coming in fast , running and kicking like colts with the coolness that had come on the land . The gopher was outp148of his hole again , moving in little flirts and looking up and piping . It was beginning to get dark . The fire in the west was about out ; low in the east one star burned . Boone wished someone would quiet that calf . Summers said , " ' Pears you swallered a prickly pear , hoss . " " Huh ! " Uncle Zeb reached in and fingered the cud from his mouth and put a fresh one in . " Beaver 's a fair price , a mighty fair price . It is , now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the beaver , " Uncle Zeb said while his mouth moved to set the chew right . The horses trotted by , kicking up a dust , shying and snorting as they passed the seated men . Behind them came four riders , dressed in the white blanket coats that the workmen at the fort wore . " I mind the time beaver was everywhere , " Uncle Zeb said . His voice had turned milder and had a faraway tone in it , as if the whisky had started to work deep and easy in him . Or was it that he was just old and could n't hold to a feeling ? " I do now . Everywhere . It was poor doin 's , them days , not to trap a good pack every hunt . And now ? " He fell silent as if there was nothing fitting a man could lay tongue to . " Look , " he said , straightening a little , " another five year and there 'll be naught but coarse fur , and it goin ' fast . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you 'll be out on the prairie , hide huntin ' , chasin ' bufller and skinnin " em , and seein ' the end come to that , too . " " Not five year , " said Summers . " More like fifty . " " Ahh ! The beaver 's nigh gone now . Baffler 's next . Wo n't be even a goddam poor bull fifty years ahead . You 'll see plows comin ' across the plains , and people settin ' out to farm . " He leaned forward , bringing his hands up . " They laugh at this nigger , but it 's truth all the same . Ca n't be t'otherwise . The Company alone 's sendin ' twenty-five thousand beaver skins out in a year , and thousand or more-hides . Besides , a heap of buf ler 's killed by huntersand never skinned , and a heap of skins is used by the Injuns , and a passel of ' em drownds every spring . Ahh ! " " There 's beaver aplenty yit , " replied Summers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He do n't catch ' em inside a fort , or while makin ' meat . " " Amen and go to hell , Dick ! On'y , whisky 's hard to come by off on a hunt . Gim me a pull on your bottle . I got a turrible dry . "  |p149Boone  heard his own voice , sounding tight and toneless . " She still looks new to me , new and purty . " In the growing darkness he could feel Uncle Zeb 's eyes on him , looking at him from under their thickets  --  tired old eyes that whisky had run red rivers in . " We 're pushin ' on , " said Summers , " beyant the Milk , to Blackfootcountry . " " This child heerd tell . " " Well , now ? " " This nigger do n't know , Dick . It 's risky  --  powerful risky , like you know . Like as not you 'll go under . " " We got a heap of whisky , and powder and ball and guns , and beads and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dick ? " " A few . " " They 're mean . Oh , by God , they 're mean ! An ' tricky and onreliable . But you know that as good as me . Got a interpreter ? " " Just this hoss . I know it a little , and sign talk , of course . Weai n't got beaver for a passel of interpreters . " " You dodged Blackfeet enough to learn a little , I 'm thinkin ' . " " Plenty plews there . " " They do n't do a dead nigger no good . Pass the bottle . " " How are you and McKenzie ? " " The bourgeway bastard , with his fancy getup and his tableclothand his nose in the air like a man stinks ! Y'know the clerks ca n't set to his table without a coat on ? And the chinchin ' company , squeezin ' hell out of a man and chargin ' him Christ knows what for belly rot ! McKenzie , pays this child , and this child kills his meat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just tradin ' meat for whisky . " " Zeb , " Summers said , " this here 's secret as the grave . Would n't do for it to get out . It would n't now . " " My mouth do n't run to them cayutes , drunk or sober . " " We got a little squaw , daughter of a Blackfoot chief , she says , that was stole by the Crows and made a getaway . A boat picked her up , nigh dead , and took her on to St. Louis last fall . We 're takin ' her back . " " Umm . Injuns do n't set much store by squaws . " " Blackfeet like their young'ns more'n most . " " A squaw ? "  | " I know , but still ? " " Might be . " Uncle Zeb was silent for what seemed a long time . " This nigger heerd something from the Rocks about that Crow party . Heavy Otter  --  ai n't that the chief ? " " That 's the name she gave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Umm . " " We make talk purty slick , what with her 1'arnin ' a little white man 's talk and me knowin ' some Blackfoot . Me and her together , we do n't need no interpreter . " " This nigger do n't like it . " " Your stick would n't float that way ? We 'll cut you in , and handsome . Better'n bein ' a fort hunter . " In the darkness Boone could see Uncle Zeb 's head shake . " It ai n't a go , Dick . It ai n't now . " " I recollect when it would be . " It seemed to Boone that all of time was in Uncle Zeb 's voice . " Not now , hoss . Not any more . This child ai n't scared , like you know , but it ai n't worth it . It 's tolerable here , and whisky 's plenty even if it costs a heap . " " What you hear about the Blackfeet ? " " The Rocks say they 're away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Me , now , I 'd say go to Maria 's River , or along there , and fort up , quicker'n scat . " " Too fur . Take a month , even with Jourdonnais blisterin ' the crew . Buffler an ' Blackfeet would be back afore we could set our-selves . " " Uh-huh . There 's mostly some Injuns around Maria 's River all the time . Anyways , get your fort up fast . " " That 's how this child figgered . A little fort , quick , ready for ' em when they come back to the river . " " It 's risky doin 's , anyways you lay your sights . " " You figger the Company 's like to take a hand in this game ? " " McKenzie 's got plans for the Blackfeet . He 's makin ' medicine . He is , now . Come fall or winter , he 'll p'int that way , or try to . But he 'll let ye be , likely , thinkin ' the Blackfeet and the British 'll handlethings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger p'inted at him , now you 're so fur up . " " He said he might send a boat up , to buck us. "  | " No sech . He ai n't got the hands right now . If this nigger smells a stink afore you pass the Milk , he 'll get word to you one way or t' other . " " Heap obliged , hoss . " Uncle Zeb got up unsteadily , his knees cracking as he straightenedthem out . " If it gits to talk , ask for Big Leg of the Piegans , and give a present , sayin ' it 's from me . We 're brothers , he said onc't . " " That 's some , now . Obliged again . " Uncle Zeb walked away , swaying some and not saying goodbye . The three others made off in the direction of the Mandan , wakingthe Indian dogs , which started barking all at once . They could hear loud voices and laughs and sometimes a whoop from inside the fort . " Liquorin ' up , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's head swam with the whisky . It was the first he had let himself drink much of in a long time . " I reckon old age just come on Uncle Zeb , " he said . After a silence he added , " It 's fair country yit . " Summers was keeping them in the open , away from the river . " It 's fair , sure enough , " Deakins agreed . Summers said , " Watch out for them pesky prickly pear . They go right through a moccasin . " Already autumn was coming to the upper Missouri , theshort northern autumn that was here and gone like abird flying . Flecked in the green of the cottonwood trees , telltale leaves hung yellow , giving limply to the breeze . The bloodredberries of the graisse de boeuf sparkled along the silver limbs . It was often chill in the morning , warming as the sun got up and lay on the land in a golden glow , and cooling again as it finished its shortened arch and fell in flames among the hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Blackfeet who populated Jourdonnais ' mind . Day on day he drove them , routing them out before the sun was up , keeping them at the line until the hills darkened and the light lay pale along the water like something remembered from the day . It was nearly always the line now , the line which was the last resort and main reliance , for the wind wasp152seldom good . The men went half-naked along the soft shores , sinkingto the knee , to the crotch , sometimes to the belly . They flounderedin the mud , or waded out into the water or jumped from point to point among the drift , falling sometimes and coming up wet and sputtering but going on . Where the river permitted they splashed into it and pushed the Mandan with their hands ; when they had to , they climbed along the bluffs like the grossecorne . They were a crew now , such a crew as not even the Company could boast , wise in the ways of the Missouri and the keelboat , strong and long-enduring and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and the great bear . Always with them he had Summers or Caudill or Deakins to kill the snake and shoot the bear , and to watch for the Pieds Noirs . Not an Indian had they seen all the way from Union to the Milk and beyond  --  not an Assiniboine , not a Blackfoot , not a man of any kind . It was as if the land was deserted , except for the elk and the deer and the buffalo and the bear . Everywhere one saw them , at every bend , on every island , on every bar  --  not the great herds of buffalo that made the earth tremble , but wanderers , three or four or a dozen , browsing on the bottom grass , drinking in the stream . The hunters killed enough meat for half a dozen crews , taking only the choice parts , spiking them to a great pair of elk antlers that had been placed in the prow . At night and in the early morning the wolves howled over what was left . Along the wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where Indians and maybe the bold mountain men had butchered in their turn . Mon Dieu , what a place for game ! The Kentucky hunters could not be restrained . They awakened C eager every morning , to shoot more bear , more buffalo , more elk and deer and bighorn , coming in later with the red meat slung all around them and maybe with the head and claws of a bear or the rough roll of a rattlesnake with the head smashed flat . The Mandan went on , the river lessening and the land rising into shapes that no one could believe , like castles and ruins that old folk remembered from France , like forts and battlements , like shapes a man would see only when he had the fever or a craziness in the head . Yellow , red , and white along the shores , and flashings like the mirrored sun and , above and beyond , the prairie , the so-big plains rolling on , yellow and dry now so that even the single wolf left a slow trail of dust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , toop153empty . It made the mind small and the heart tight and the belly drawn , lying wild and lost under such a reach of sky as put a man in fear of heaven . It was the little things that made one at home in the world , that made him happy and forgetful ; neighbors to hail and supper on a table and a good woman to love , and the tavern and fire and small talk , and walls and roofs to shut out the terrors of God , except for glimpse enough to keep the sinner Christian . Often discouragement rode Jourdonnais , making his voice harsh and his way hard . It seemed to him then that not even the good God could help him . For success , all must turn right and in its time : the Indians must stay away until the fort was built ; they must come when it was ready , and come with fine furs  --  beaver and otter and mink ; he must do his business quickly and be gone , before ice closed the river . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe already they had been to Fort de Prairie and traded with the British . How long to build a fort ? Two weeks ? Three ? More ? How keep the Indians friendly ? How keep them off the boat ? How prevent them from overrunning the fort , if the fort really ever was built ? How manage them drunk ? How get word to them when all was ready ? How make them hold back the shot or the arrow until they could hear about Teal Eye ? When his thoughts were dark he made himself think about Teal Eye , who was like a cricket now , happy and active , looking out , saying things as if to herself , with an expression on the little face of one coming home and seeing maybe the remembered gate , or the old fence , or the house in the trees after a long time away . The daughter of Heavy Otter coming to her father 's lodge . The daughter being brought home by the white brother . Yes , if the nationwished , he , Jourdonnais @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and send not one boat but two and maybe three every season , and perhaps build more posts so that the Blackfeet had not to travel far . Let them bring their beaver to him , and he would bring them strouding and paints and sky-blue beads and powder and ball and alcohol and all that made a nation happy and great . Little Teal Eye , like a bird , like a fledgling hopping ! It could be that this journey was not a single gamble for a few thousand dollars only , for one cargo of fine furs and then the end , but the beginning of a big trading house , like American or Hudson 's Bay , dealing in fine furs and in coarse , in robes and buffalo tongues . Maybe he wouldp154wear a ruffled shirt and a fine suit , and people would stand back waiting on his words . Pent-titre . Peut-titre . The little squaw , with an eye like the bluewing teal ! How the young Caudill had fought when Chouquette had tried to slip into the bushes after her ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like thunder in his face , for all that he hardly spoke . Chouquette was a thick and powerful man , wise at fighting with fists and knees and thumbs and , need be , the knife , but he was no match against the other 's fury . Even his knife failed him , kicked away as he got it out and tried to arise . And at the end , before those flames in the eye and the storm in the face , he had cried out for mercy . It was good , Jourdonnaisthought , to have another to protect Teal Eye , but it puzzledhim still that one should have fought for her who seldom looked at her and then only with an unmoving face . He shrugged inwardly , telling himself the way of Americans was often strange . For all the want of Indians , he and Summers were more careful than before . Two men stood each watch now , and at night the Mandantied up on the south shore , away from the side the Blackfeet were thought to roam in . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept on board , lying crowded fore and aft except for a little space around Teal Eye 's lodge , where he or Summers lay . The men looked like corpses , with their blankets drawn over their faces as a protection against the mosquitoes that made a cloud about every man , day and night , unless the wind blew or the cold came . The mosquitoes flushed out of the willows in the daytime , out of the sedgy grass that the feet of the boatmen disturbed , in streams that ran like wisps of smoke and grew into wheeling circles around each head . Let a man stop to light his pipe or load his rifle and before he was done they covered his hands and face . They plagued the men at the cordelle , who rubbed mud thick on themselves and learned to fight with one hand and pull with the other without losingmore than a little of their pace . Only the grasshoppers , a crawlingcarpet in the faded grass above the bluffs , were so many , and grasshoppers were no bother except when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . They only crawled or flew away clacking , showing red or yellow wings spotted with black . This place , Summers ? Non ? It is clear and behind it the wood is plenty for the fort . Non ? You think the hill too close , so Indians could fire inside the palisades . Time passes , Summers . South bankp155or north ? No matter ? This place ? It is beautiful . Non ? This one then ? Mon Dieu , we do not have eternity ! It take time to build a fort and do the trading . Another day , you think ? Two ? How many ? Enfant de garce ! Here ? Here ? Ah , now , at last ! They were eighteen days out from Fort Union , above a stream that Summers thought was Teapot Creek . The hunter 's hand had gestured toward a little flatland that ran back treeless for two hundred yards and more . " Good as we 'll do . She 's clear enough at the sides , and the trees at the back ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No hills near enough to bother . " " Good ! Good ! " Jourdonnais blew the breath from his lungs , lettinghimself relax for a moment , but only for a moment . He looked at the sun . " We ' ave time for a start . " Summers nodded . " Time to fort up some . " He went forward and adjusted the swivel . They pulled to and put the crew ashore , distributing powder and ball first . Afterwards Summers studied the hills with the glass . " I 'll get ' em going . Caudill ! Deakins ! Take a look yonder . " To the crew he said , " We 'll stack the rifles where they 're handy . " He set the boatmen to dragging in fallen logs and piling them close to shore so as to make a low three-sided enclosure which opened on the river . " Injuns Yarned me this . It 's a help , come a fight . " It was growing dark when they finished . Pambrun was warmingfood in the fire he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acrost , " said Summers , scanning the hills . " Do n't hurt to play safe . " He whistled for Caudill and Deakins , giving the high twotonedcry of the curlew . " Tomorrow we can get to work on a sureenoughfort . " " Oui . " Jourdonnais ' heart was lighter than it had been in days . He felt assurance rising in him , as if he had had a big drink of good brandy . In two weeks , of a certainty , they could build the fort and be ready . He let himself see the Indians streaming down from the hills , shaking the hands of the white men who had brought one of the nation home . He saw quick and peaceful trading , much fine furs , money . As the Mandan moved into the south bank he looked down at Teal Eye and smiled . She was like one of them now . If not quite easy in their company , she had a kind of shy and watchingconfidence , like a wild thing nearly tamed . She would speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trader who had brought herp156all the long miles , who had seen that no harm came to her . She was a good child and a pretty one , with her black hair and oval face and fine eyes . Almost , he hated to give her up , even for beaver . He went to sleep thinking about her and about plews and wealth and the new house and , on the rim of things that could be , a great trading company that alone enjoyed the trade of the Blackfeet . When he awakened in the morning , Teal Eye was gone . Every day before he let them put across from the south shore Summers went off with the ship 's glass while Jourdonnais fretted , striding back and forth on the bank or pacing the boat , looking over the river to the growing pile of cottonwood pickets , looking upstream , looking down , looking for Summers to come back , and swearing in French because he had to wait . Boone scouted while the men worked , he and Deakins and Summers did  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away up the gulch that flowed out into the little prairie they were building the fort on . Often when the plains seemed peaceful and a man could n't see anywhere the rising dust that might mean buffalo and might mean Indians , one of them would come in and give a hand . They shot meat when they needed it , but mostly in the late evening when the men were easing up and the chance of bringing Indians on was least . Half the men and more worked in the trees that spread down from the gulch , cutting down cottonwoods , lopping off the bigger branches and the tops and toting the trunks to the others near the bank for shaping up as pickets , to be set later in the trench they had dug . One in every five men took a gun with him . Rifles for the others were stowed behind the three-sided breastwork they had built . The men kept busy early and late , working like niggers while they swore and dripped sweat in the autumn sun , driven by Jourdonnais ' rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did the work of three men , helping chop , helping trim , helping shape . Since Teal Eye ran away he was like a man with a fever in him . His hard square face never smiled now . When the teeth shone under his black mustache it was because he was swearing at the men or callingon God to see what he had to put up with . The men growledp157and often sassed him , their anger showing black in their eyes , but they did as he said , maybe afraid to balk or run away , maybe knowingthey had best stay with him for all he was so cranky . " Come Indians , " Summers had told them while their eyes flicked from one to another , " make for these here logs and grab a rifle . Shoot plumb , too . Noise do n't kill Injuns . We can hold off a heap of Blackfeet if you do right . " Lying on the deck or standing guard at night or looking for Indian sign by day , Boone thought often about Teal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though she was n't much more than a papoose . Why did she run away ? Did she get back home to her pappy ? Summers had tried to track her down that first morningbut had come back at noon shaking his head . " She just lit out . She did now . Ai n't nobody can trace her , I 'm thinkin ' . " Jourdonnais ' jaw muscles ridged his face . " Someone pay for this , " he promised . " Someone asleep on guard let her go . I find out . " " We did n't look for her to run , " Summers reminded him . " Ai n't anybody 's fault more'n our own . " From a rise up the river Boone could see the men working and the felled trees lying naked near the bank . Jourdonnais ' voice carried to him , small with distance but still full of fury . " You , Chouquette ! You , Lassereau ! You think we have the year to build ! Goddam ! " Boone could look up to the crest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the river to the top of the slope and beyond , where the yellow prairie lay . Jourdonnais and the men and the axes biting into wood were the only noises in the world , except for a bird sometimes and late in the evening the nighthawkswhimpering in the deep sky . He wondered whether Teal Eye heard them , too . He wondered if ever he would see her again . All the time his eyes kept busy , looking for movement , looking for color , looking for something out of place . After a while he would go on , down to the river , maybe , watching for moccasin tracks , or up on the plain where he spent a good part of his time , his eye out for moving streamers of dust . When the sun sank he would start for the boat , seeing from the rise the lazy plume that Pambrun 's fire sent up from the cargo box . When Summers returned with the glass on the third morning of their stay , he drew Jourdonnais aside and then motioned top158Boone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , south . " " So ? " " Heap of dust , makin ' this way . Maybe just buffler , maybe Injuns . I best see . " " We go across without you , " Jourdonnais suggested . " We never get the fort up , waiting . " Summers nodded . " Keep your eye peeled . Do it , now . " Jourdonnais got out a segar and chewed on it , forgetting to light it . " I 'm thinkin ' you better let Caudill and Deakins scout afore you put the men out . " Summers turned and walked away and was lost to view in the brush . They rowed across , losing ground against the current and afterwardsbringing her upstream with the line . Boone and Jim leaped ashore . The sun had just got itself clear of the hills and shone round as a plate . The chill was lifting off the river in little lines of vapor . " We 'll git back , quick as we see , " Boone said . " Go ! Go on ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right . " Boone made for the woods at the back of the clearing , from the side of his eye seeing Jim going on downstream . The grass was wet as rain with the dew . Things looked as they always had . There was the big cottonwood , with the broken limb flying its yellow leaves , the buffalo-berry bush showing silver and red , the game path going into the woods , marked with fresh tracks from the night . A striped squirrel played along ahead of him . The first notion he had that things were n't right came with a small shifting in a thicket a hundred yards or more away , a patch of brown that faded out before the eye and might have been nothing . He saw a puff of black smoke and felt a tug high on his shoulder , close against the neck , and heard the crack of a rifle . Then all the quiet woods came alive . From behind trees and clumps and thicketsIndians leaped , whooping . He saw them in one confused instant , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daubed with red and black , the mouths open , the guns puffing smoke , and the taut wood of the bows leaping against the strings . He heard bullets whistle and the flutter of arrows . Then he did what he had been told to do . He gave one sharp cry of warning andp159turned and ran for the breastwork . Before him the crew broke into a scurry like half-grown birds that a hunter had stumbled on . One of them ran ahead , making for the boat . Boone fell behind the logs and slewed around and rested his rifle and pressed the trigger and saw a heavy-set buck falter and go over . The Indians were n't more than fifty yards away , the closest of them . The shot slowed them but they came on . Jourdonnais lay beside him , and Romaine , sighting along his rifle . Jourdonnais ' voice sounded above the cries of the Indians , calling on the crew to come and help . His rifle spit out a cloud of smoke . Boone reached for a loaded weapon . Romaine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The wave of Indians faltered , and suddenly there was no wave at all , but only the top of a headdress showing over the grass or the black of a scalp above a hump and the noses of the muskets poking out and the arrows being fitted to the bows . " Non ! Non ! " It was Jourdonnais , screaming as if a pain was in him , Jourdonnais , turned half-about and screaming at the crew . Boone caught one glimpse of them splashing in the water , climbingwildly aboard the Mandan . Someone had cut the boat loose . It was edging out and down with the current . " Non ! Non ! Mother of God ! " It was as if nothing but the boat counted with Jourdonnais . It was as if the boat pulled him to his knees , to his feet , to his full height . He began to run for it . He shouted over his shoulder , " Romaine ! " Someone on board touched off the swivel . Its boom beat against the hills , wiping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grass . Boone looked behind him . Jourdonnais had staggered round , a great hole showing in his chest . He fell sprawled out . There was no one in the breastworks now but Boone . He fired once more and dropped the gun and scuttled for the shore , seeing behind him the Indians rising and coming on . Their shouts pounded on his ears . Romaine was on his hands and knees with half the shaft of an arrow sticking from his back . He motioned Boone on with a weak and helpless gesture of the hand that left him face down in the grass . Something told Boone to keep away from the boat . He ran , hearing the bangs of muskets and the feathered whisper of the arrows , and dived into the river , turning upstream after he hit thep160water so as to keep close in to the shore , swimming under water untilhis lungs were like to burst . He turned over and let his lips up for air and went under again , stroking with arms and legs while the trapped breath in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chest and he let himself up easy , his head poking into the brush of a fallen tree . He saw bodies lying humped and sprawled on deck . The air was full of a wild shouting which the water cut off as he went under again . He heard instead only the river murmuring by his ears . He came up and sank and swam , came up and sank and swam . After a while the cries of the Indians began to seem distant . He pulled himself into the bank , into a thick cluster of red willow , and sat there for a long time , watching through his screen . It was all over now , except for the yelling and the prancing and the sound of muskets shooting into dead men . When the Indians passed Jourdonnais ' body or the big lump that had been Romaine , they pointed and fired , or fell on their knees and beat the heads with rocks . Boone reckoned it was scalps they waved around their heads . Squaws and naked children had flocked out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They started beatingat the bodies , too , aiming mostly at the crotch . A squaw with a knife went to work on Romaine , holding up her cut afterwards for everyone to see . The Mandan had been brought to again . Boone could n't see the bodies for the Indians on her . The men were all dead , though , dead and being shot up and cut to pieces with the tomahawks he saw raised . High on the mast clung Painter , his dark coat fuzzed out . Some of the Indians had painted their faces coal black . Boone fingered the hole by his neck that the ball had made . It had no feeling in it . The blood had seeped down and made a watery stain on his chest . He crawled away with a coldness on him , inside and out , thinking of people who beat a man 's brains out or cut off his pizzle after he was dead . His heart made a slow , heavy thump in his chest . His wet buckskins chafed him . He wished he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the left , leaving the Indians in sight whenever a man wanted to stick his head out of the shore bushes . They were still yelling , still shooting , still prancing around . He saw one of them carrying a keg . He was safe for a spell . Theyp161would n't leave there until they had drunk up the whisky . He looked across the river , thinking he might see Summers . Did Jim get away ? He was down river , out of the charge . Jim seemed far off , like someone he had known a long time before . He could n't put his face together in his mind . He could see the blue eyes and the red hair and the mouth smiling , but he could n't fit one to the other and make Jim 's face . He kept going , traveling soft as he could . He did n't seem to feel the mosquitoes that found a man no matter what . The sun swung up and started down . The point of land that the curve looped shut off his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . After a while they were only a lost echo . Would it be Teal Eye that set the Indians on them ? It did n't matter , he reckoned . The sun went behind the hills and the air was still as glass and the sky deep . When he stopped , the silence seemed to sing above the little whine of the mosquitoes and the sound of water . He pulled himself into some thick bushes and lay flat with his head on his arm , feeling empty and loose like a sack . A bird hopped on a limb and for a long time looked at him out of its round eye and then went on with its business as if he was n't there . He heard the silence and the mosquitoes and the river . By and by he remembered he was hearing something else , something far off across the water , something he had heard before in another time of his life . It was a sharp , rising whistle such as the curlew made.  |p162The  wind was warm , coming over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wintry in the branchesof the trees and then it would ease up and be no more than a whisper that the ear would n't catch unless it listened . When it quieted Boone could hear water dripping in the dark , dripping from the iced tree limbs and the shoulder of rock that rose just behind the camp . The wind blew most of the time in this country , squeezingout of the canyons and sweeping on to the high plains , until a man got so used to it he hardly paid it any mind , except sometimes at night when he 'd wake up and hear the wild , sad sound of it and hunch down farther in his blanket and buffalo robe , feeling safe , somehow , and good . By and by sleep would come on him again , and the wind would be like a river flowing , running along with his dreams . Out from the circle of the camp with its center of fire the snowy land seemed to float off into darkness , rising or falling or stretching out , depending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountainsmade a high broken line against the night sky . Summers reached out and got a branch from the fire and lightedhis pipe with it , his weathered face coming out red as he drew on the stem . He had taken his cap off , and the fire played along his hair , bringing out the white in it . Jim was chewing at a bone . Out of the side of his mouth he said , " Comin ' time to git busy . " Summers squirmed his tail farther down on the sheep 's skull he sat on and rested his elbows on the horns that arched up at his sides like the arms of a chair . It was like his hair got whiter everyP166day , or maybe it was just that the white showed more with the hair reaching down to his shoulders . " Ai n't spring yet , I 'm thinkin ' . Winter 'll get in another lick or so . " He puffed slowly on his pipe , looking into the fire . " Grass ca n't shine too soon for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the length of cottonwood he held between his knees . The bark peeled off in a long , limber shaving . He cut the shaving crosswise into small pieces and tossed the pieces onto a little pile to feed his horses in the morning . " Horses eat enough bark to keep one of them there steamboats going . " " We got to git somewheres ahead of the rest , " Jim said . " We 'll git somewheres , " Summers answered . " If it ai n't the Wind or the Grey Bull or the Popo Agie , it 'll be another . " " Might be they 're trapped out . " " We 'll find beaver . Always have . " If a man took his eyes away from the fire and kept them on the sky the stars seemed to come close , burning brighter all the while . The Big Dipper stood out plain , the sides of it pointing to the North Star , which was small but steadier than most , not winking like the others did . Boone brought his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick and began shaving it . A man had to keep his horses fit . He had seen horses that had gnawed each other 's tails down to a nub , they got that hungry . Right now when he listened he could hear their own horses stamping the snow out in the darkness , trying to get down to grass . " I reckon beaver wo n't be no higher , " said Jim , " and no thicker , neither . " Summers roused himself to say , " We wo n't be seein ' any twelvedollarplews , I 'm thinkin ' , like they paid onc't at Fort Clark . Fat meat like that could n't shine long . " " The damn Company 's got us by the tail now , since Fitzpatrick and Bridger throwed in with ' em . Ai n't none to bid ag'in ' em . That 's what ails beaver . " " That , " Summers said , nodding , " and them Londoners makin ' hats out of silk , if what we hear tell is right . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had heard that kind of talk for two winters or more . " It ai n't done . You 'll see . " " I got a piece of land around Independence , Missouri State , P167if it 's still there , " Summers said as if he was n't talking to them but just thinking to himself . " It do n't matter so much about the beaver . Not to me , " said Boone . " Just so a man ketches enough for tobacco and powder and ball and sometimes some whisky . " To Summers Jim said , " All Boone hankers for is fat meat and a fire and to be away from folks . " It was good enough , Boone thought to himself . What did a man want as long as he had marrowbones and hump ribs and a fire to keep him warm and a free country to move around in ? It took something to beat a place where you could kill a buffalo every day and not half try and take just the best of it and leave the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless maybe it was a good squaw to keep camp and to lie with him at night ? " A man gets a feeling when the years pile up on him , " Summerswent on , still as if he was talking to himself . " He ai n't so spry sometimes in the mornin ' , and at night he has to keep rollin ' out to let off water , and his bones hurt , and he figures he 's certain sure to lose his scalp if he keeps on . " " You been talkin ' thataway , Dick , since God knows when , " Boone said . Summers did n't answer . " Git back there , and they could n't tie you to stay . You 're still sassy as a setter pup , pointin ' anything that shakes its tail . " The mention of God set Jim off , like it always did . He locked his hands behind his head and leaned back against a stump . " I reckon God do n't like a man to set his sights too high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reckon He thinks nobody 's got a right to feel big savin ' Himself . Ai n't room in the puddle but for one big frog . Maybe that 's why we 're still kickin ' ; we ai n't aimin ' at nothin ' except keepin ' our hair on and our bellies full , and havin ' a time at rendezvous or maybe Taos . Ai n't nothin ' in that to git God 's dander up . " Summers did n't seem to be listening . He was just looking into the fire with his eyes slitted as he did many a time now . Boone started on another length of cottonwood . " Like Jourdonnais now , " Jim argued . " He thought to be a mighty big nabob . He did , now , till God cut him down . "   " McKenzie did n't do so bad . " " Only for a spell , Boone . Then the government found he was makin ' whisky there at Union , and you ai n't heerd of McKenzie since . I reckon that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was tolerable liquor , too , " Summers said , stirring . " A sight better than some . Seems onlikely God had anything to do with it , though ; He ai n't in the liquor business . This nigger wishes he had a can of it now . " " It ai n't so long till rendezvous . " Jim ran his tongue around his mouth . " That 's what I 'm living for , is rendezvous . Whisky and playin ' hand , and the Injun girls all purtied up , yours for a cut of cloth or a hawk 's bell or a Green River knife for her man . Jesus ! " " Things do n't figure to shine so much , " answered Summers . " Not with Bonneville back in the army and Wyeth in Boston . Be a plenty of Indians , but not so many packs and not so much money . Not so many mountain men , either , the way they been pullin ' out . " " ' Member how the Snakes looked at Bonneville 's bald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off apurpose so 's he could n't be scalped ? " Jim chuckled . Boone answered Summers . " We get beaver enough . " " By travelin ' by ourself . By taking chances . Trappin ' small and quiet , a man can ketch beaver yet , if he do n't lose his scalp . " " And lose out on some fun , too , " Jim said , his gaze fixed on Boone . " It would n't have hurt our ketch , nohow , to 've rendevoused for winter with Bridger 's men on the Yellowstone . " " This here suits me , " Boone answered . It had suited him for a long time now , this life along the streams and in the hills  --  so long it seemed like forever . Jim was always letting fret get into him and wanting to put out for St. Louis or Taos or anywhere that people were . Taos was all right when it came to that ; he had followed along after Jim and Summers a time or two . And maybe St. Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to wet his whistle and did n't let himself get tangled with the law ; but once , when he had thought to go with Jim and Summers , he had turned back at the settlements , feeling strange and uneasy and caged in . This life had suited him a long time , saving the weeks they had spent on foot dodging Blackfeet after Jourdonnais and the crewP169went under . Once in a while those days would come back to him yet , as real as if just happening , and he would hear the curlew 's cry coming from across the river and would fear to answer it and would make his legs carry him upstream along the bank until he found a log and pushed off with it for the other side . Summers and Jim had watched him coming , and they fished him out of the river and half-carried him away , stopping after a while in a thicket where Summers had a look at the wound by his neck . Summers ' voice would come to him , low and friendly and with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musket ball wo n't put you under , hoss . This place ai n't nothin ' . I seen holes as bad made by a sticker bush . " Summers ' eyes were smiling . Boone looked up into the gray of them and over Summers ' bent head saw the sky dulling off to night . He reckoned he ought to smile back but he did n't have the will for it . The days ran together when he thought back to them , so that what he remembered was n't time set off and divided , with this and that happening on such and such a day . What he remembered was the fear on him like a weight , the long hiding , the pushing ahead when his legs were limber and his breath dry and fast in his throat , the wound hurting steady , and Jim helping him , and Summers , and Jim looking anxious when he thought Boone did n't see . They walked one day after another , keeping when they could to the brush or the cuts the water had made , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each time putting a teensy bit of ground under them while they looked ahead on plains land that flowed on and on forever . Some places it was so bare that even a rabbit could n't find a good place to hide , and a man got the feeling then that the Blackfeet were perched all around , watching from where the plains rimmed up to the sky . Their moccasins wore out , and the rawhide from the buffalo Summers had dared to shoot clung stiff and clumsy to the foot ; and step and step they went on , the spines of cactus angry in the flesh , and their bellies drawn up in their ribs and the taste of wild-rose berries and raw prairie turnips in their mouths , for not often would Summers take the chance of striking a fire or shooting meat . The sun swam across the sky and went down early , and a keen chill flowed on the land , so that they shivered in their buckskinsand slept close for warmth and roused early when the nightP170was coldest and went on , heading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heading across the endlesstumble of plain , and lying one time in the grass when a party of Indians came into sight and passed by and grew into nothing . They kept on , joked and cheered and pushed along by Summers , and then  --  in the early morning , it was  --  they met up with six huntersfrom the Rocky Mountain Fur Company and went with them to winter rendezvous on the Powder . It was n't so far , that rendezvous , from where they were camped now  --  not so far by miles , anyhow . By time it seemed a long way off . Summers nosed the logs farther into the fire , which had been built Indian fashion , with the ends of the wood rather than the middle in the blaze . A little shower of sparks arose , until the wind woke up and sent them streaming . Flames licked at the logs and then came up in one tongue , lighting the camping place . Through the wide mouths of the skin lodges , set close against the shoulder of rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small bags of fixings . The graining block stood behind him , a half-worked deerskin on it . Close by ran a pole , set in crotches , that they hung their meat on . There was n't but a chunk or two of fresh meat on it now , and the meat they had dried for winter was all eaten up ; tomorrow he 'd kill a cow , and he and Summers and Jim would feast on the young one she carried in her . Farther out , he could see the white trunks of quaking asp glimmering as the fire flickered . A horse sneezed , unseen in the darkness , and out still farther , rumped on some hill , a wolf howled . Boone shivered inside his hunting shirt , feeling lonely and good with the darkness crowding around him and the spot of fire holding it back and the wind sad in the trees . His gaze went to Summers and saw him tighten a little and grow still , as if all the strength of his eyes and ears was brought to one point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would seem to be drowsing , and then there would be a sound somewhere or a movement , and you would see that he was alive and quick all the time , quicker and more alive than anybody , as if his senses told him things even in his sleep . His hand went over and curled around his rifle and brought it , slanting out , across his knees . Jim started to say something but fell silent as Summers let out a low hissing noise . P171Boone heard it now , too , the sound of feet coming toward the fire , coming careless and loud , crunching in the snow , as if the man swinging them had n't a fright in the world . He had his own rifle in his hands . The nose of Summers ' weapon moved to the right and steadied . Into the circle of firelight a top-heavy figure moved and grew to be an Indian carrying an antelope across his back . He dumped the carcass by the fire and straightened and looked around , first at Summers , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bony face creased into a sudden smile that showed he had two teeth missing in front . He had a crooked nose that came down almost to his lip and seemed about to poke into the hole that the teeth had left . " How , " he said , and began to laugh , a laugh that started deep in him and bubbled out , until a man hearing him had to laugh , too , it was so true and silly . " How , " said Summers . The Indian brushed a tangle of hair out of his eyes and took the bow and quiver from his shoulder and let them drop . For a huntingshirt he had on an old deerskin that had been doubled over and a hole cut for his head . He had it tied with whangs under his arms . " Talk English , me , " he announced . " Heap good . Plenty good . " " So ? " The Indian slapped himself on the chest . " Good . " " Talk it then , hoss . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim got a surprised look in his face and then began to howl . A little smile worked at Summers ' mouth . " Dogged if that hoss do n't run the circle , " he said to Boone and Jim . The Indian said " Son a bitch " as if it was a word he 'd just thought of . " You shore shine at trapper 's talk . You do now . Who be ye , Injun ? " The Indian squatted down by the fire , where Boone could see his leggings were old and thin with hardly a fringe left . The cloth shirt he wore under the deerskin was probably red once . " Blackfoot , me . " His words ran into Indian talk . Summers listenedclose , nodding that he understood . When he was through Summers said , " Here 's a nigger without a nation . Says he 's a Blood , but had a set-to with them for someP172reason , and so he run off . Lived with the Kootenai for a spell , and the Flatheads and Shoshones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nigh bare-assed  --  but he do n't act that way . " The Indian smiled again . The fire showed his tongue working behind the gap in his teeth . " Love Long Knives , me . Love whisky . Love whisky heap . " He looked around , smiling a kind of baby smile under the long , hooked nose , as if he expected one of them to offer him a can . " Drink heap whisky , me . " " I 'm thinkin ' he 's a true-blue Blackfoot . " To the Indian Summerssaid , " No got whisky . No medicine water . All gone . Eat ? " He invited , and pointed to a piece of meat still skewered on a stick that slanted over the fire . The Indian jerked the meat from the stick and set his jaws into it and took the knife from his waist and ran it in front of his nose , cutting a bite from the chunk . He gulped and laughed his strong , bubbling laugh again for no reason at all unless because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Otter , " Boone said to Summers . Summers ' voice went out , hoarse and choppy . The Indian stopped chewing and made a face and combed his greasy hand through his hair . Then he said " Goddam " and went on chewing . Jim was watching him , his face screwed into a questioning grin as if he had never seen his like before . " Kin we keep him , Pap ? " he asked as a young one would have asked it . When the Indian had finished the meat he combed his hair again , looking pleased and friendly . He yawned then and suddenly let himself down , squirming onto his back on the pine boughs that Summers had spread over the last snow . " Sleep , " he announced and closed his eyes . Summers looked at Boone and Jim . " We got a partner , if'n we want him . " The wind had strengthened again , wailing through the trees . Through the wailing Boone could catch the sound of the creek , beginning to run with thaw . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to camp , " Jim said , motioningtoward the antelope . " Besides , he does me a sight of good . " " Acts like he 's asleep a'ready , " Boone said , " like a baby or apup or something . For all he 's so damn ugly , he tickles a man . " Summers did n't say any more , but got up and went inside hisshelter and came back with an old robe . " This is like feedin ' a lostP173dog , " he warned . " I 'm thinkin ' we ca n't get shet of him . " When Jim and Boone did n't answer he dropped the robe over the Indian . He looked out into the dark then , looked out and listened while he thought . " Wind feels like spring , sure enough . This nigger thinks if need be we could go acrost to the Bear or along Lewis Fork and down the Snake a ways . " Boone lifted himself from the ground and stood straight and looked at the dipper again and at the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lying over the Blackfoot country , lying over Jourdonnais ' bones , which were likely rotted and gone now , lying over the lodges of the Piegans , and Teal Eye maybe in one of them . It was a time since the Mandan 's crew went under . He counted back . Seven seasons . Seven seasons since he had seen the Indian girl with an eye like the bluewing teal . She would be growed now , and most likely have a man . He wondered what had set him to thinking so keen about her . It could n't be just a foolish runaway Blackfoot with a long nose and a gap in his teeth  --  not him alone , anyhow . From high overhead he caught the faint honk of geese driving north to nesting grounds . There was still snow above the Wind River plains , a deepsnow with an old crust that skinned the front legs of thelead horse after he had broken through . Boone and Jimand Summers took turns breaking trail , so as to even the hurtamong the horses . Loaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed along , one behind Boone and one behindJim , and at the rear came Poordevil , riding the horse they had spared him and singing out " Hi-yi " every once in a while . Whenever Boone looked back Poordevil gave a big grin , showingthe slot in his teeth . Sometimes he would pull out of the trail andlunge up alongside of Boone and grin again and say some fool thingjust to hear his own voice . " Heap beaver heap quick betcha goddam . " Down from the hills the plains looked almost dusty , andwarm and quiet , as if below the reach of the winds that on theridges were like a hand pushing into a man 's face . Boone could seep174buffalo below , like a fluid stain on the tanned grass , and bunches of trees , and antelopes moving light and easy as birds . The sunlightlay yellow and soft on them all , seeming to have a warmth down there that it lost on the high places . Across the plains to the west the Wind River mountains climbed into snow banks . Boone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet this way . Big parties , like Jim Bridger 's , put such a fright into beaver they would n't stir from their lodges or would n't come to medicine if they did . Even when the parties thought it was safe enough to split up , they left more beaver than they caught , what with one man holding a rifle and the other setting traps and both of them splashing along and maybe talking . A man took chances , hunting small ; Indians might happen on him any day . If he kept his scalp , though , he got plews . And the risk was n't so great with Summers along  --  not with a man along who could tell from the eye and ear of a horse or the set of a buffalo whether there was aught about . Boone figured he and Jim had got good themselves at smellingIndians ; they would n't have their hair if they had n't . He had seen men at rendezvous would n't know a war whoop if they heard one . Some of them were dead now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if they did n't learn better , or if they did n't quit the mountains , as some of them were doing , and some true trappers , too . They had hurt the hunting , though , pushing up every trickle of wateruntil there was hardly a place a man could feel was fresh any more . It gave him a little pinch when he thought about them , about pork eaters from Canada and Missouri graybacks and Yankee tradersand men from Kentucky and Tennessee moving in , traveling along streams and through passes that a man liked to think were his own , just as it gave him a pinch when he thought back to last year and remembered the white women that a couple of crazy preachers had brought to rendezvous on Horse Creek , bound on across to the Columbia . Damned if they were n't on wheels , those preachers and their women ! He heard later they got a cart as far as the British post on the Boise . White women ! And wheels ! They figured to spoil a country , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunter who had fought Indians and gone emptystomachedand like to froze , and he 'd say it was no place for worn/en , or for preachers , either , or farmers . And no place for wagons or carts , except maybe to bring trade goods as far as rendezvous . The rocks would knock them to pieces , and the rivers wash them down , and the sun shrivel the wheels apart . All the same , he got a pinch of misery , thinking , just as he had sometimes in Kentuckywhen he 'd be out in the woods , feeling good that he was alone , with everything to himself , and then he would spy someone and it would all be spoiled , as if the country was n't his any more , or the woods or the quiet . Ahead of him , Jim 's hair streamed from under his hat like a lick of fire . Jim let his hair hang long and loose , like Summers . For himself , Boone liked it better in a couple of plaits , like the Indians wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would get himself some new ribbons , come the rendezvous , and a new hunting shirt and leggings , with some hawks ' bells and colored strings for the fringes . Buckskin got old and greasy in a year and lost its fringes , one by one , as a man needed laces for his moccasins . He would buy himself a new rifle , too , a percussion Hawken , about thirty-two balls to the pound ; people were coming to see that a cap and ball was better than a flintlock , just as he had always said . And he would play some hand and drink some whisky and have himself a squaw , and then he would be ready to go on . There was n't any sense in staying when a man 's beaver was spent . Summers pulled up and swung his leg from across his horse and stood looking down at the plains , which seemed close but would take a spell to get to with the going like it was . Though spring was coming on , Summers still wore his old capote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his head . He reached inside and got out a piece of roasted liver and began to munch while his eye traveled north and south and back again . Jim dismounted , too , and then Boone , and from the back Poordevil came galloping up and threw himself from his horse , showing off , and fell in the snow . Summers handed him a piece of liver when he got up . Poordevil grinned and bit into it and cleaned the slot with his tongue and took another bite . Summers said , " This nigger 's had enough of sagebrush fires and cold camps . That there timber looks good . " " It 's like someone forgot to put a tree between the Powder andp176the Popo Agie , " Jim said . " I aim to put my feet to a sure-enough fire and cook meat over quaking ash and set and set and eat and eat . It wears a body down , pullin ' stems to keep a blaze . " Over nothing , Poordevil said , " Oh , goddam ! " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nigger says what 's bitin ' him . " Summers ' gray eye was studying the Indian . " He just talks to hear hisself , like a boy shootin ' a new rifle at nothin ' . " " All the same , " Boone said , " he 's comical . I would n't care no more for a bear cub . " Poordevil saw they were talking about him and felt big for it . He hit himself on the chest . " Hi-yi . Love whisky , me . " " Git on your medicine dog , you crazy bastard , " Summers said . " We 're goin ' to kill us a bull and build a fire . " Before he mounted he added , " We 'll poke along the Popo Agie and the Wind and maybeup the Horn , dependin ' . We 'll catch beaver enough with the plews we got from fall , I 'm thinkin ' . " Jim faced half around to the north . " Reckon we 'd fare better up a ways ? " " With Bridger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boone said , " Rendezvous is comin ' soon enough , Jim . You 'll see all them as is on Clark 's Fork . " Summers said to Boone , " 01 ' Red Head is a sociable nigger . " The horses stood slack in the snow , their eyes sad and lifeless , their ribs showing through the long winter hair . " I 'll break the way for a spell , " Boone said , and stooped and examined the knees of his horse . " Come to Tar Springs , I 'll doctor ye , Blackie , " he promised . Blackie was a good horse , for all that he was ganted up now . Let the Indians have their white and spotted buffaloponies ; he would take a solid dark . The bull Boone killed was young and fat enough , fatter than a cow would be now with a calf pulling on her and the grass scant yet . A couple of wolves loped up out of nowhere at the sound of the shot , and from a sky that did n't have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little piece off and stepped back and forth , all the while keeping their sharp eyes on the butchering . The wolves rumped down to wait , their tongues hanging out and dripping , their gaze following the tenderloin and tongue and liver and marrowbonep177that Boone and Summers packed on the horses . The horses had come alive , now they were out of the snow , and kept cropping at the grass , eating it clear down into the dirt . There was a good camping spot , with a small meadow almost shut in by the trees , near where the Wind and the Popo Agie joined to make the Horn . The four men pulled the saddles off and hobbled the horses with rawhide and turned them loose to graze . Summers took a long look around first , saying as he nearly always did , " It 's a sight better to count ribs than tracks , " and meaning it was better to keep a horse tied up and hungry than to turn him loose and let him get stolen by Indians . Poordevil gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a little while all of them had sticks slanted over the blaze with chunks of liver on the ends . Jim had put a pot on the fire , too , into which he had cut pieces of bull meat . Summers said , " Wisht we had some coffee , " and Jim put in , " I hanker for salt , " but straight meat and river water were good enough . They kept up a man 's strength and never made him sick , no matter how much he ate , and made his blood good , too . A mountainman never got a running sore or a toothache or shook with a fever  --  or almost never , anyway . After a while he lost his taste for salt and bread and greens and such . It was warmer down in the valley and clear of snow except where the trees grew thick and kept the wind and sun away . The sun was shining now , far off , giving only a touch of warmth when it lay on the back of a man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains that reared up , white where the snow lay and blue on the bare rock . From the west the wind was puffing . After he had a bellyful Boone stretched out with his feet to the fire and his head on the saddle and slept . When he awakened the sun was near to the mountains , fixing soon to sink from sight . " Jim went downstream , him and Poordevil , " Summers informed him . Summers was spreading skins over some saplings to make a lodge . " I 'll point up , soon 's I get my outfit on . " He peeled off his leggingsand got into a pair that had been cut off at the knees and pieced out with a blanket . There was nothing gave a trapper misery like hide drying tight on the legs , unless it was moccasins thatp178had n't been smoked enough and pinched a man so , drying out , that he had to cripple out of his bed at night and dip them in the water again . Boone 's own moccasins were made from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were beaver left all right . Boone saw cuttings along the stream and after a little came to a dam and peeked over . The pond lay smooth at first , and then a wedge of ripples started close to the bank and the point of it came toward him and sharpened into a head and turned and went the other way and sank into the water without a sound , leaving just the ripples running out and whisperingalong the banks . Boone slipped along the shore , walking soft in the snow that lay old and coarse underneath the trees , keeping back from the ice that edged the pond where the water was shallow . When he found a likely place , he walked around it and went beyond and laid his traps down . He leaned his rifle against a bush , cut and sharpened a long , dry stick and cocked a trap , and then , carrying rifle and stick and trap , went to the spot he had chosen . He rested his rifle on the bank there , felt for footing on the fringe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , into the water . The water was cold  --  so cold it knotted the flesh , so cold it made a man wish for a larger stream where he could use a dugout and poke quietly along the banks , dry as could be . He lifted a foot out of the water , grunting a little with the cramp in it , and put it back and brought the other one up . After that , they did n't hurt him any more , feeling only dead and wooden in his moccasins . He felt the mud stiff and thick under his soles and saw bubbles rising around his ankles and smelled the sulphur smell they brought up . He stooped and put the cocked trap in the water , so that the surface came a hand above the trigger , and led the chain out into deeper water until he came to the end of it . Then he slipped the stick through the ring in the chain and pushed the stick in the mud , putting all his weight to it . He tapped it next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Back at the bank he cut a willow twig and peeled it , and from his belt took the point of antelope horn he kept his medicine in . The medicine came to his nose , strong and gamy , as he took the stopper out . He dipped the twig in the medicine , restoppered his bottle and put it back , and stooped again and thrust the dry end of the twig into the mud between the jaws of thep179trap , so that the baited end stuck about four inches above the surface of the water . It would n't be long , he reckoned , until a beaver came to medicine . Backing up , he toed out the footprints his moccasinshad left . With his hands he splashed water on the bank so as to drown out his scent . He reached out and got his rifle then and waded along the edge of the pond . When he came opposite his traps he stepped ashore . By the time Boone had set four traps it had grown too dark to place the other two . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim and Poordevil eating boiled bull off pieces of bark , as the Snake Indians did . He found a chunk of bark himself and spooned meat on it and took the knife from his belt and ate . The spoon and kettle and one can , and the knives they wore , were all they had for cooking and eating since the Crows had paid them a visit in the fall . " Beaver about , " Jim said , and Boone nodded and went on chewing . Summers was looking out into the closing darkness . He got up after a while , stiffly , and took his rifle . " Travel weather . I 'm thinkin ' we 'll see Injuns any time . Best to bring in the horses and peg ' em close . " Poordevil said , " Medicine dogs all gone . " " Do n't git to it afore it happens , " Boone answered . " You mean medicine dogs 'll be all gone . " " All gone . Goddam . " He trailed along after Summers to bring the horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time , smoking and looking into it and not saying anything much . When his feet were dry Boone went into the lodge and laid himself down . He heard the others getting up and yawning and making a splatter on the ground before they came to bed , and then he did n't hear them any more , for the wind was flowing along with his dreams , flowing in the north country , rippling the grass , singing around lodges he had never seen till now . The days were gone when a man could sleep as long as he wantedand get up lazy and eat some meat and lie down again , glad for warmth and a full stomach and even the ice that put the beaver out of reach . It was n't quite sunup when Boone awakened , hearingp180the sharp chirp of a winter bird that spring was giving a voice to . The others were sleeping , except for Summers who was sitting up and shivering a little . Poordevil was snoring a kind of whistling snore , as if the gap in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bird cheeped , he would stop and then start in again , maybe gettingthe cheep mixed up in his dreams . Jim 's head was covered by his blanket . You would think he was a dead one , back in the settlements , lying there quiet with the cover over him from toe to scalp lock . There was still some fire left , and some meat in the pot . Shakingin his buckskins , Boone threw some grass on the coals and nosed sticks over them . The flame came up , making him feel warmer just from the sight of it . The sun bulged up from the eastern hills , catchingthe Wind River mountains first and turning the snowbanks whiterthan any cloud . Not a thing moved as far as Boone could tell , and not a noise sounded , except for Poordevil 's whistling snore and the fire busy among the sticks . Even the bird had fallen silent . The wind itself was still now , blown over east and gone , and a man listening heard only his ears straining . Boone set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , standing dull and patient , hobbled and tied to their picket lines . Blackie nickered and nosed Boone 's shoulder as Boone bent over the knot . When the horses were watered he tied them up again . They would have time to graze later after the morning hunt was over . " Fair morning , " Summers said when he came back . " Good thaw , though , or a rain , and the streams 'll be too high for huntin ' . " He was looking west , to the snowbanks that looked clean-washed on the mountains . They set out after they had eaten , Jim and Poordevil downstreamand Boone up , and Summers across to the Wind . The pond lay quiet as a sheet of ice . There was no sound in it or in all the woods , except for the quiet gurgle of water finding a small way around the dam . A fish nosed the surface while Boone watched , and the water riffled and lay flat again . From the dam he could see that his stick was gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trap . Sometimes a man worked so quiet he did n't do right . Like as not the beaver lay drowned in deep water now , and he would have to wade out and maybe swim for the plew andp181the twelve-dollar trap that held it . Only it was n't once in a coon 's age a beaver pulled loose on him , he sank his sticks that deep . He walked to the setting place , searching with his eyes for the stick floating and the ring of the chain around it . After a while he made out the float , lying free along the edge of ice , with the ring gone from it . A man could n't tell where the beaver was , without he drowned quick , close to where the trap grabbed him . Boone waded out and looked into the water , following it while it got deeper and darker untilthe bottom was lost to his eye . He straightened and shifted his rifle to the other hand , and stepped back toward shore to ease the ache in his legs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of willows behind him , a bare whisperin the limbs . He looked around and saw the end of the chain , not knowing it for what it was , at first . He stooped and seized it and pulled her from the bushes , a young she in the prime . She crouched down when he had yanked her into the clear , not trying to run , but just crouching , looking at him while her nose trembled and a little shivering went over her . " Got ye , " he said , and cast about with his hand and picked up a dead stick big enough to kill her with . P- He saw now that she had been at work on her leg . A little bit more and she would have chewed herself free . There were just the tendons holding , and a ragged flap of skin . The broken bone stuck out of the jaws of the trap , white and clean as a peeled root . Around her mouth he could see blood . She looked at him , still not moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes that were dark and fluid and fearful , out of big eyes that liquid seemed to run in , out of eyes like a wounded bird 's . They made him a little uneasy , stirring something that lay just beyond the edge of his mind and would n't come out where he could see it . She let out a soft whimper as he raised the stick , and then the stick fell , and the eye that had been looking at him bulged out crazily , not looking at anything , not something alive and liquid any more , not something that spoke , but only a bloody eyeball knocked from its socket . It was only a beaver 's eye all the time . He skinned her , and cut off the tail and knifed out and tied the castor glands so they would n't leak and rolled them in the plew andp182reset his trap and went on . He got two more beaver . The fourth set was untouched . It was a good-enough morning . Walking back to camp , he thought about rendezvous  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sick River and head on south for the winter , to Taos , which people sometimes called Fernandez . A man could n't tell what Summers would do , maybe not even Summershimself . Boone wondered whether Poordevil would want to go back to the Blackfeet . Thinking about the north country , of a suddenhe knew what the beaver 's eyes had put him in mind of . Trapping or traveling , Jim Deakins watched the country for dust and the buffalo for movement , as any mountain manwould . Winter and summer , the Blackfeet were pushing south from the Three Forks to war on the Crows , and going on , a many a long camp from home , to rub out white men as they trapped the streams and made over the passes . It was n't Indian sign he wanted to see , though ; Bridger 's men ought to come out of the north any time now , pointed for rendezvous . Allen would be with them , maybe , and Lanter and Hornsbeck and others that he had had himself a time with before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Boone and Summers had , but a man got lonesome finally and hankered for people and for frolics . It was good to tell stories sometimes and to hear stories told and to brag and to laugh over nothing and play horse while the whisky worked in you , and to have the good feeling in the back of your head all the time that when you were through talking and betting and drinking and wrestling there would be an Indian girl waiting for you ; and , afterwards , you would lie quiet with her and hear the coyotes singing and the stream washing and see the stars down close and feel the warmth of her , and the lonesomenesswould all be gone , as if the world itself had come to set a spell with you. ake Boone , now . He never seemed to get lonesome or to wantsee folks , except once in a while for a squaw that he was throughp183with almost as quick as he got her . He was like an animal , like a young bull that traveled alone , satisfied just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . It was as if he talked to the country for company , and the country talked to him , and as if that was enough . He found his fill of people quick ; he took his fill of whisky quicker , drinking it down like an Indian and getting himself good and drunk while another man was just warming up . Then one morning before rendezvous was more than half over he would wake up and want to make off , to places where you would n't see a white man in a coon 's age . Summers was the same in a way , but different , too , for Summersseemed to live in his head a good part of the time , as if it was the years kept him company . He would sit at the campfire and smoke or go about the horses or tend to the skins , and a man would know that he was away back in his mind , seeing old things , things that had happened long ago , before the Mandan ever put out from St. Louis , seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man down on the Platte . Summers liked company , all right , and liked drinking and frolics as well as anybody , but in a quiet way , as if nothing that happened now was as important as what had gone before . It was age getting him , likely ; a man was lucky if he did n't grow too old and have to think that the best of what was going to happen to him had already happened . God was mighty mean in some ways , letting a body get on to the point where he alhungered .. toturn back , making him know he was n't the man he had been. , making his . bed cold but keeping in his mind the time when it was n't . It was like a man was pushed backwards down hill , seeing the top getting farther from him every day , but always seeing it , always wishing he could go back . Sometimes God seemed pretty small . - t/Summers was in one of his spells now , just sitting and smoking and thinking , and saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokento first . Boone had dug a hole where the fire was and put a deer 's head in it and raked the coals over . In the kettle there was meat cut small , cooking with wild onions that Jim had pulled , rememberingfood back in Kentucky . " We might as well be gettin ' on , with the water so high , " Jim said . " Be rendezvous time before it goes down . "  |p184Summers  asked " Reckon ? " as if he was n't listening . Boone and Poordevil sat away from them a little . As Jim watched , Boone put his finger on his eye and Poordevil sounded the Indian word for it . Boone tried the word then , practicing with it until Poordevil smiled and bobbed his head that he had got it right . Jim bent over the moccasin he was making , pulling a whang through the holes his awl had bored . Boone had got so 's he spent a deal of time talking with Poordevil that way , learning the Blackfootwords for things . The sun was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep a little , and then it would be time to look at the traps again . Even with the water as high as it was , they caught a few beaver . It might be he would go out first and kill some meat . The cows were thin yet . Bull was better , or mountain sheep . There was a mess of mountain sheep on the shoulders of the Wind mountains  --  ramsand ewes and lambs full of play . They leaped along slopes that would affright a bird , never falling , never hurting themselves . Jim looked up from his work and let his eye go all around , and then he took to his feet and looked harder , at the buffalo runningnorth of them . Summers saw him and got up and looked , too , and reached over for the rifle he had leaned against a tree . He jerked his head as Boone lifted his glance . They stood watching , seeing the buffalo stream to the east , leaving a slow rising cloud behind them . Without speaking Summers moved off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The horses snorted as they trotted to them , and tried to shy off , rearing and plunging with the hobbles but making a poor , out at getting away . Back at camp , the men threw saddles on them and led them into a patch of brush . Summers squinted through the branches . The cloud that the buffalo had left was sinking , and at the tail end of it Jim could see horsemen coming through . " Ca n't tell , " Summers said . " Injuns or hunters . They ai n't like to sight our fire at this time of day without they ride close . " " Long Knives , " Poordevil announced . " No Injuns . " " We 'll see . Looks to be six or ten . " Except for Poordevil , who stood at the side of his horse withoutp185even his bow in his hand , they brought their saddle horses in front of them as the horsemen approached , looking over the backs of them and on through the branches with their rifles rested across their saddles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't figger how that nigger 's lived so long . " If it was Long Knives it would be Bridger 's men , Jim thought  --  Bridger 's men making for rendezvous on the Seeds-kee-dee which some folks were calling the Green River now . Summers relaxed . " Injuns do n't carry rifles that way , I 'm thinkin ' . " He stepped from the brush . The horses pulled up short , and the riders swung their rifles on him until he shouted at them and fired his own weapon in the air . Jim fired his gun then , and heard Boone 's go off next to him , and then there was a quick scattering of shots and voices shouting and hoofbeats thudding on the ground as the horsemen swept up . " Dogged if it ai n't Allen and Shutts and Reeson . How , Elbridge ? How , Robinson ? " The men slid from their horses and shook hands around , yelling " Hi-yi , " some of them , and strutting like Indians , making a show for all that their buckskins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nothing . One of the eight kept to his horse , though , a big , loose man whose slouched shoulders made a wide arch over his saddle horn . His eyes went around and fixed on Poordevil , as if Poordevil had done something against him . Still looking , he pulled off the handkerchief he had about his head , and Jim saw that a plume of hair grew solid white from a scar at the hair line in front . " Ai n't you gon na light , Streak ? " Lanter asked . " Or are you gon na let your tail grow to that there mare ? " They all moved around , talking , telling about the winter , fillingthe quiet air with sound , all except the big man who still sat his horse with no smile on his face and no word in his mouth . " Where 's Bridger and the rest ? " Summers asked . " Comin ' along . We took out ahead . " " How 's beaver ? " " We catched a few . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " Damn the goddam Injuns ! " It was Streak speaking , speaking as he looked at Poordevil . " What 's that one ? "  |p186Summers  looked up but did n't answer right away , and Boone put in " Blackfoot " and looked afterward as if he knew he should n't have said it . " What ! " " More like a Poordevil , " Summers said . " Let 's smoke . " Streak got down off the horse and stood holding his gun . It was a smart rifle , decorated with brass tacks and a pattern of vermilion , as if he had just done fancying it up . " We got ourselves a few plews , " Summers was saying , talking to the rest but keeping the tail of his eye on Streak . " Not so many , though . It 's poor doin 's , account of floodwater . " Boone stood a little apart , listening . " A goddam Blackfoot , is he ? " Lanter said , " No need actin ' like a sore-tailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bastard out . " " You 'll get kilt yourself . " Boone had stepped in front of Streak , between him and Poordevil . Poordevil just stood there , not quite understanding , his eyes going around and his mouth open showing his broken jaw , and his crazy deerskin shirt hanging comical on him . " By God ! " Streak turned his head around to look at the others , who fell silent one by one and shifted a little , expecting trouble . " You hear what I did ? Leave ' im alone , he says , leave ' im alone , us as 've been fighting Blackfeet all winter . Leave ' im alone , like as if the Blackfeet did n't send Bodah under , like as if the Blackfeet ai n't dogged us all along and put lead in some of us . " He turned on Boone , and his finger pointed to the scar on his hairline . " Whar you think I got this ? From old age ? Blackfeet , by God , four years ago . Knicked my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took me for dead , lyin ' there , but we raised runnin ' , me and my mare , afore they lifted my scalp . " " It was n't Poordevil done it . " " One 's like t' other , much as two peas . " Jim saw two of Bridger 's men nodding as they agreed with Streak . The rest just stood there , waiting for what would happen next , their faces sober and their eyes sharp . Come a fight , he and Boone and Summers and Poordevil figured to get the worst of it , with eight on the other side . Boone was looking Streak in the eye , giving him a sort of dark ,  |p187wild  look , the kind of look Jim had seen him give just before his temper broke . Boone was a sudden man , acting first and thinking after . Jim wondered that he held in so good now . " This nigger can outrun , outdrink , outstud , and outfight any son of a bitch that sides with a Blackfoot . Stand out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Jim saw the look on Boone 's face that meant he would n't stand any more . He saw the look and saw Summers slide between them , moving quick and easy like a young man . " Hold in , now . We aim to get along nice and sociable . I reckon we 're plumb glad to see you . But we do n't aim to have Poordevil kilt , not by anyone . Not by you , Streak , and not by any of the rest  --  you , Shutts , or you , Reeson , or Allen , or any of the rest if you 're a mind to stand with Streak . If it 's blood you want you 'll have it , but some of it 'll be yours , I 'm thinkin ' . " His gaze fixed on Streak and then went to the others , and there was n't anything in his face except quiet . Jim stepped over by him , his unloaded rifle in his hand , and there were the four of them together looking at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lost his foolish smile , Jim noticed as he moved , and stood quiet but sharp and alive , like an animal waiting for a man to make a move . For a moment things seemed to hang , like a rock teetering on a slope , not knowing whether to roll or settle , and then Russell said easily , " I would n't fight Dick Summers for the whole damn BlackfootNation and the Rapahoes to boot . " It was like the rock settling . Lanter grunted . " Me neither . These here are friends . Y'hear , Streak ? " After a silence Streak gave in . " I was n't fixin ' to fight any but that Blackfoot . I 'd like his scalp for my old leggin 's . I would , now . " He let himself be turned around to the fire and sat down and by and by smoked with the rest , not like a man with a fright in him , but like one just waiting his time . " We ai n't fixed good for company , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into it . " We got meat , " Lanter said , " a sight of good bull meat  --  a little blue , maybe , but not as blue as some I 've et . " He got up , and Robinsonwith him , and went to one of the pack horses and came back carrying cuts of it . The others got out their knives and carved themselves piecesp188and speared them on roasting sticks . Lanter , who looked as old as time and as weather-beaten as any rock , yelled as one of them bent over the meat . " Do n't be cuttin ' that meat ag'in the grain ! Other way saves the blood and juice . Y'hear ? " The dark little man he spoke to looked up , his great eyes seeming to swim in his head , and nodded and went to work with his knife again . " No more sense'n a fool hen , that greenhorn Spaniard , " Lanter muttered . " He 'd sp'ile young cow , he would . " He watched his own cut beginning to sizzle over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat is good . " " Savin ' snake meat , " Hornsbeck put in . " This nigger 's throat plumb shuts up at snake meat . I et it onc't , after wreckin ' a bull boat and losin ' everything ' cept my hair , an ' I do declare it were a long fight ' twixt my pore paunch and that there snake . " Lanter turned his stick . " Meat 's meat , I say , bull or cow or snake or whatever . But man meat ai n't proper meat to this child 's way of thinkin ' . " He took his knife and cut a slice from his roast and spoke while his jaws worked on it . " I put tooth to man meat onc't , down with the Diggers , who made out it was jerked goat when they traded . Stringy , it was , and kind of white , and it grew in the mouth while a man chewed on it . " He swallowed his mouthful . " It ai n't proper doin 's . It ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goose cooked Injun style with the guts in and a roastin ' stick pushed through from honker to hole , and raw fish and old moccasins when there was nothin ' better , but my stomach is real delicate on man meat . " Poordevil had squatted by Boone , like a dog by its owner . His mouth was open , and through the hole in his teeth Jim could see his tongue lying pink and wet . As the meat browned , the men would carve off the outside , leaving the inside red and dripping to cook some more . When the meat was gone Russell got up and stood waiting for the rest . " We best be getting on , " he announced . " How you pointin ' ? " Summers asked . " To the Sweetwater and over . Come along . " Jim wanted to say " Sure , " but Summers ' gaze came to him and flicked on to Boone and Streak and Poordevil , and he said , " Reckonp189not , Russell . We can find us a- few beaver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reckon we 'll go up the Wind and over to Jackson 's Hole and to rendezvous that way . We got time enough . " " We 'll go on , then . " Streak turned in his saddle as they rode off and stared at Boone and then at Poordevil and hitched himself and went on . Jim figured he might as well have said he was n't done yet . Jim knew that Boone saw him , too , but Boone did n't say anything . He just watched the men ride away and by and by turned to Poordevil and put his finger to his eye and said , " No-waps-spa , " and Poordevil bobbed his head . Dick Summers pulled the hood over his head and broughthis capote closer about him . There was no place in God'sworld where the wind blew as it did on the pass goingover to Jackson 's Hole . It came keen off the great high snow fields , wave on wave of it , tearing at a man , knocking him around , drivingat his mouth and nose so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head and gasp to ease the ache in his lungs . A bitter , stubborn wind that stung the face and watered the eye and bentthe horses ' heads and whipped their tails straight out behind them . A fierce , sad wind , crying in a crazy tumble of mountains that theIndians told many a tale about , tales of queer doings and spirit peopleand medicines strong and strange . The feel of it got into a mansometimes as he pushed deep into these dark hills , making himwonder , putting him on guard against things he could n't lay histongue to , making him anxious , in a way , for all that he did n't believethe Indians ' stories . It flung itself on the traveler where thegoing was risky . It hit him in the face when he rounded a shoulder . It pushed against him like a wall on the reaches . Sometimes on arise it seemed to come from everywhere at once , slamming at backand front and sides , so there was n't a way a man could turn his headto shelter his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ andfarther into the wild heights of rock , until finally on the other sidep190he would see the Grand Teton , rising slim and straight like a lodgepolepine , standing purple against the blue sky , standing higher than he could believe ; and he would feel better for seeing it , knowingJackson 's Hole was there and Jackson 's Lake and the dams he had trapped and the headwaters of the Seeds-kee-dee not so far away . Summers bent his head into the wind , letting his horse make its own pace . Behind him plodded his pack horse , led by the lariat in his hand , and behind the pack horse came Boone and Jim and Poordevil and their animals . It was known country to Summers , the Wind range was , and the everlasting snow fields and the Grand Teton that could come into sight soon , known country and old country to him now . He could remember when it was new , and a man setting foot on it could believe he was the first one , and a man seeing it could give names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Ashley and Provot and Jed Smith , the cool half-parson whom the Comanches had killed down on the Cimarron . It was as if everything was just made then , laid out fresh and good and waiting for a man to come along and find it . It was all in the way a man thought , though , the way a young man thought . When the blood was strong and the heat high a body felt the earth was newborn like himself ; but when he got some years on him he knew different ; down deep in his bones he understood that everything was old , old as time , maybe  --  so old he wondered what folks had been on it before the Indians themselves , following up the waters and pitching their lodges on spots that he had thought were his alone and not shared by people who had gone before . It made a man feel old himself to know that younger ones coming along would believe the world was new , just as he had done , just as Boone and Jim were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose the Grand Teton at last , so thin , seen from here , it did n't seem real . Summers pulled up to let the horses blow and felt the wind driving through to his skin and clear to his secret guts , with the keen touch of the snow fields in it . Boone yelled something to him , and Summers shook his head , and Boone cupped his hands around his mouth and yelled again , but sound would n't come against the wind ; it blew backward down the pass , and Summers found himself wondering how far it would blow until it died out and wasp191just one with the rush of air . He shook his head again , and Boone grinned and made a signal with his hand to show it did n't matter , and afterward tucked his chin around to the side to catch his breath . High to his left Summers could see a mountain sheep standing braced and looking , its head held high under the great load of horn . The trees grew twisted from cracks in the rock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the weight of it . He let his gaze go to the back trail , to Boone and Jim and the horses standing hunched and sorry , their hair making patterns underthe push of the wind . They were good boys , both , though different , brave and willing and wise to mountain ways . They were hivernans  --  winterers  --  whocould smell an Indian as far as anybody and keep calm and shoot plumb center when the time came . Summers wondered , feeling a little foolish inside , that he still wanted to protectthem , like an uncle or a pappy or somebody . It was Boone he felt most like protecting , because Boone thought simple and acted straight and quick . He did n't know how to get around a thing , how to talk his way out or to laugh trouble off , the way Jim did . Not that Jim was scared ; he just had a slick way with him . Come finally to a fight , he did n't shy off. ; Boone , now , was dead certain to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Streak , and not in a play battle , either . It would be one or t' other , Summers was sure , and shook his head to get shut of the small black cloud at the back of it . When they were going again his thoughts went back . As a man got older he felt different about things in other ways . He liked rendezvousstill and to see the hills and travel the streams and all , but half the pleasure was in the remembering mind . A place did n't stand alone after a man had been there once . It stood along with the times he had had , with the thoughts he had thought , with the men he had played and fought and drunk with , so when he got there again he was always asking whatever became of so-and-so , asking if the othersminded a certain time . It stood with the young him and the formerfeelings . A river was n't the same once a man had camped by it . The tree he saw again was n't the same tree if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was the first time and the place alone , and afterwards there was the place and the time and the man he used to be , all mixed up , one with the other.  |p192Summers  could go back in his mind and see the gentler country in Missouri State , and it was rich , too , if different  --  rich in rememberednests and squirrels and redbirds in the bush and fish caught and fowl shot , rich in soil turned and the corn rising higher than a boy 's head , making a hidey-hole for him . He could go back there and live and be happy , he reckoned , as happy as a hoss could be with the fire going out of him and remembered things coming stronger and stronger into the mind . Anyhow , he had seen the best of the mountains when the time was best . Beaver was poor doings now , and rendezvous was pinchingout , and there was talk about farms over on the Columbia . Had a mountain man best close out , too ? Had he best go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eat bread and hog meat and , when he felt like it , just send his mind back to the mountains ? Would he say goodbye to it all , except in his head ? To rendezvousand hunting and set-tos with Indians and lonesome streams and high mountains and the great empty places that made a man feel like he was alone and cozy in the unspoiled beginnings of things ? Could he fit himself back among people where he dass n't break wind without looking about first ? A man looking at things for the last time wanted to fix them in his head . He wanted to look separately at every tree and rock and run of water and to say goodbye to each and to tuck the pictures of them away so 's they would n't ever be quite lost to him . Jackson Lake and the wind down to a breath , the Three Tetons rising , the Hoary-Headed Fathers of the Snakes , and night and sleep and roundabout to rendezvous , trapping a little as they went , adding to their packs , going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Seeds-kee-dee , and then seeing from a distancethe slow smoke of campfires rising , the men and motion , the lodges pitched around , the color that the blankets made and the horses grazing , and hearing Boone and Jim yelling and shooting off their rifles while they galloped ahead , drumming at the bellies of their horses . They made a sight , with feathers flying on them and ribbons and the horses ' manes and tails woven and stuck with eagle plumes . A greenhorn would take them for sure-enough Indians . Rendezvous again , 1837 rendezvous , but rendezvous of other times , too , rendezvous of ' thirty-two and ' twenty-six and before ,  |p193rendezvous  of all times , of men dead now , of squaws bedded with and left and forgotten , of whisky drunk and enjoyed and drained away , of plews that had become hats and the hats worn out . Summers ' horse began to lope , wanting to keep up with the others , but Summers held his rifle in front of him undischarged . A man got so he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Boone felt Summers ' gaze on him and , when he looked , saw it sink and fasten on the ground , as if Summers did n't want the thoughts he was thinking to be found in his eyes . Summers said , " This nigger could n't hit a bull 's hind end with a lodgepole after five-six drinks . " " I ai n't had too much , " Boone answered after a silence . " I can walk a line or spit through a knothole . " He drank from the can of whisky by his side . " It ai n't true , anyways . You was some , now , yesterday , firin ' offhand . You come off best . " " Did n't have more'n a swallow . " Summers and Jim were rumped down on either side of Boone . Poordevil lay on the ground in front of them , snoring , the whites of his eyes glimmering through the parted lids and the spit running from one corner of his mouth and making a dark spot in the dirt . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Summerssaid . " I ai n't fixin ' to drink no bar'l dry . " It was getting along in the afternoon , and over a ways from them a game of hand was starting up , now that the horse racing was about over for the day , and the shooting at a mark . The players sat in a line on either side of the fire . While Boone watched they began to sing out and to beat with sticks on the dry poles they had put in front of them . Every man had his stake close to him . It was skins they were betting , mostly , and credit with the company , and some trade goods and Indian makings and powder and ball , and sometimes maybe a rifle . They were n't worked up to the game yet . Come night , and they would be yelling and sweating and bettingp194high , they and others sided across from other fires . A man could make out Streak easy , with his head bare and the sun catching at the white tuft of hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian lodges , moved in closer than usual to the white camp , maybe because the rendezvous was smaller . Nearer , horses were grazing , and still nearerthe mountain men moved , talking and laughing and drinking and crowding up with some Indians at the log counter that Fitzpatrickhad set the company goods behind , under cover of skins . The tents of the company men clustered around the store . In back of them , pack saddles and ropes and such were piled . The lodges of the free trappers , from where Boone looked on , were west of the others , away from the river . Behind the counter two clerks kept busy with their account books . In front of it a couple of white huntersshowed they had a bellyful . They were dancing , Indian style , and by and by began to sing , patting their bellies with their open hands to make their voices shake , and ending with a big whoop . Hi  --  hi  --  hi  --  hi , Hi-i  --  hi-i  --  hi-i  --  hi-i , Hi-ya  --  hi-ya  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hi-ya , Hi-ya  --  hi-ya  --  hi-hi . The white men were Americans and French from Canada , mostly , but some were Spanish and some Dutch and Scotch and Irish and British . Everybody had arrived by now  --  the free trappers and the company men and Indians from all over , coming by the Sweetwaterand the Wind and over from the Snake and from Cache Valley to the south near the Great Lake , from Brown 's Hole and New and Old Parks and the Bayou Salade , coming to wait for Tom Fitzpatrickand trade goods from the States . Just yesterday Fitzpatrick had pulled in , with only forty-five men and twenty carts drawn by mules , but bringing alcohol and tobacco and sugar and coffee and blankets and shirts and such , all the same . At the side of the countertwo half-breeds were working a wedge press , already packing the furs for the trip back to St. Louis , making steady knocking noises as they drove the wedges in.  |p195It  was n't any great shakes of a rendezvous  --  not like they used to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ givingthree pints for a good plew . Now there were just the American Fur Company and Bridger and the rest of his old outfit working for it , and whisky cost four dollars and beaver went for four to five a pound , for all there was n't much of it . The Crows had n't brought in more than a mite . They and the other tribes were restless and cranky ; they talked about the white man hunting their grounds and about the Blackfeet warring on them and the traders putting low prices on fur and high ones on vermilion and blankets and strouding . They were crying  --  that 's what they said  --  because the white brother took much and left little . The mountain men grumbled , too , trading pelts for half what they used to bring and hearing talk that maybe this was the last rendezvous . It was n't any great shakes of a rendezvous , but still it was all right ; a man could n't growl , not with whisky to be had and beaver still to be caught if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country clear to him any way he might want to travel . Over his can of whisky Boone saw a little bunch of Crow girls coming on parade , dressed in bighorn skin white as milk and fancy with porcupine quills . Some of them would catch themselves a white man , and their pappies would get gifts of blankets or whisky or maybea light fusee and powder and ball , and they would be glad to have a white brother in the family , and the white man would ride away from rendezvous with his squaw and keep her while she pleased him , and then he would up and leave her , and she would be plumb crazy for a while , taking on like kin had died , but after a while , like as not , she would find another mountaineer , or anyway an Indian , and so get all right again . Sometimes squaws got sureenoughdangerous when their men left them , especially if they left one to take up with another . Boone saw that Jim 's sharp eye had picked up the girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now , " Jim said . He added , " And mighty obligin ' . " " You ought to know , " Summers said and smiled , looking at Jim as if he could see through him , looking at him with a little cloud in his eyes as if he wished he could go back to Jim 's age . " Reckonp196maybe you should take one away with you , and not buzz yourself around like a bee in clover . They ai n't after one-night rumpuses so much . Steady is what tickles ' em . " " Jim hankers for the whole damn tribe . " " You ai n't so bad yourself , Boone , or did n't used to be . Ca n't figure you out . Bet you ai n't had two women this spree . A body 'd think you was still feared of catchin ' a cold in your pants . " Some of the Crow girls were smart-looking , all right , and some of the Bannocks and Snakes and Flatheads , too , as far as that went . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls , but there was one of them , if she kept coming along and grew up to her eyes , would make these other squaws look measly . Boone said , " Must be there 's a right smart more goat in you . I had enough colds so 's not to be afraid . " The three of them sat for a while without speaking , watching Russell come lazing over from the store , smoking a pipe . " How , Russell . " " Hello , " said Russell , and stopped and drew on his pipe while his eyes went over Poordevil . Poordevil did n't have anything on but a crotch cloth that came up under his belt and folded over and ended in red tassels . The sun lay on his brown body , catching flecks of old skin and making them shine . Russell put out his toe and poked Poordevil with it as if to see if he could rouse him . To Boone Russell said , " He is n't worth fighting about , he or any of the rest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . " " As you please . " Russell was a proper man , and educated , but a good hunter , so they said , and cool in a fix . " Too bad you arrived late , " he said to Summers . " We had some excitement . " " I been hearin ' . " " Such impudence ! Those Bannock rascals coming in to trade but still refusing to give up the horses they had stolen ! " " Injuns think different from whites . " " You mean they do n't think . " " Stealin 's their way of fun , " Summers explained . " They 'll have to learn better , even if the learning comes hard . We gave the Bannocks a lesson . Killed thirteen of them right here and chased after the rest and destroyed their village and shot somep197more during the three days we fought them . In the end they promised to be good Indians . Bloody business , but necessary . " " Maybe so . " " The only way to settle disputes with hostile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wo n't forget . " " Maybe , " Summers answered again . " They 'll sing small in a few years . A wave of settlers will wash over them . The country wo n't be held back by a handful of savages . " Boone said , " What ' ud settlers do out here ? " Russell gave him a look but did n't answer . " Where you aim to fall-hunt ? " Summers asked . " Upper Yellowstone again , I guess . Fontanelle and Bridger are taking a hundred and ten men to Blackfoot country . " Boone asked , " Far as the Three Forks , or north of there ? " " I would n't think so . They 're enough Blackfeet on the Gallatin and Madison and Jefferson without going farther . " Russell strolled off , still sucking on his pipe . Boone drank again and then let himself back on his elbows , looking west , yonder to where the sun was about to roll behind the mountains . A current of air whispered by his ear , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other noises came to him again  --  the hand players calling out and beating with their sticks , the Indian dogs growling over bones , the horses sneezing while they cropped the grass , and sometimes the Indian children yelling . The sun shed a kind of gentle shine , so that everything seemed soft and warm-colored  --  the river flowing , the butte hazy in the distance , the squaws with their bright blankets , the red and black and spotted horses stepping with their noses to the grass , the hills sharp against the sky and the sky blue , the lodges painted and pointed neat and the fire smoke rising slow , and high overhead a big hawk gliding . It was funny , the way Jim and Summers had their eye out for him , not wanting him to frolic until he and Streak had had it out . Boone knew how much he could hold and still move quick and straight . He knew how much he could hold and it was a considerable  --  asmuch , maybe , as any man at rendezvous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  not much , anyway  --  just so 's to be on guard . Besides , Streak had n't acted up , not to him , or picked on Poordevil , though he had made his brags around , saying he didn'tp198walk small for any man and would get himself a Blackfoot yet , saying he could whip the likes of Caudill day or night , rain or shine , hot or cold or however . Summers allowed that Streak had held in because there was n't any whisky in camp until yesterday . Boone rested back on his elbows , feeling large and good , feelingthe whisky warming his belly and spreading out , so that his arms and legs and neck all felt strong and pleasured , as if each had a happy little life of its own . This was the way to live , free and easy , with time all a man 's own and none to say no to him . A body got so 's he felt everything was kin to him , the earth and sky and buffaloand beaver and the yellow moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a house , better than breathing in spoiled air and feeling caged like a varmint , better than running after the law or having the law running after you and looking to rules all the time until you wondered could you even take down your pants without somebody 's say-so . Here a man lived natural . Some day , maybe , it would all end , as Summers said it would , but not any ways soon  --  not so soon a body had to look ahead and figure what to do with the beaver gone and churches and courthouses and such standing where he used to stand all alone . The country was too wild and cold for settlers . Things went up and down and up again . Everything did . Beaver would come back , and fat prices , and the good times that old men said were going forever . Poordevil groaned and opened one red eye and closed it quick , as if he was n't up , yet , to facing things . " How , Blackfoot . " Poordevil licked his lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put his hand out , toward the can at Boone 's side , and his eyes begged for a drink . " First time I ever heerd goddam split , " Jim said . " Seems on-religious . " " Not yet , you do n't , " Boone said to Poordevil . " Medicine first . Good medicine . " He heaved himself up and went toward the fire and picked up the can he had set by it . It had water in it and a good splash of gall from the cow Summers had shot that morning . " Bitters . That 's medicine now . " He lifted the can and let his nose samplethe rank smell of it . Before he handed it to the Indian he took a drink himself . " Here , Injun . Swaller away . " Poordevil sniffed of the bitters , like a dog at a heap of freshp199dung , and brought up his upper lip in a curl that showed the gap between his teeth . He tilted the can and drank fast , his throat bobbingas he gulped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and held out his hand for the whisky . He had a dull , silly , friendly look on his face like a man might expect to find on a no-account dog 's if it so happened a dog could smile . Between the red lids his eyes looked misty , as if they did n't bring things to him clear . Of a sudden Boone felt like doing something . That was the way it was with whisky . It lay in the stomach comfortable and peaceful for a time , and then it made a body get up and do . All around , the fires were beginning to show red , now that dark was starting to close in . Boone could see men moving around them , or sitting , and sometimes a camp kicker jerking a buffalo ham high from the fire to get off the ashes . There were talk and shouts and laughter and the chant and rattle of the hand players . It was a time when men let go of themselves , feeling full and big in the chest . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh and drink and fight , a time to see who had the fastest horse and the truest eye and the plumbcenterrifle , a time to see who was the best man . " I aim to move around , " Boone said , and picked up his empty can . " Last night you was n't up to so much , Boone . " It was Jim talking . " Me and Dick , we kep ' our nose out of the strong water , just in case . " " Goddam it ! You going to be dry all rendezvous ? I ai n't skeered . " Jim did n't answer , but Summers looked up with his little smile and said , " Not the whole livin ' time , Boone . Just long enough , is all . " " Best get it over with right now , then . " Summers lifted himself and felt of the knife in his belt and took his rifle in his hand . " This nigger would n't say so , son . It 's poor doin 's , makin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foller . " " Git up , Poordevil . " Boone toed the Indian 's ribs . " Whisky . Heap whisky . " Poordevil hoisted his tail in the air , like a cow getting up , and came to his feet staggering a little . " Love whisky , me . Love white brother . " " White brother love Poordevil , " Jim said with his eyes on Boone.  | " Love Poordevil heap . He 's bound to , ai n't he , Dick , with whisky four dollars a pint ? Nigh a plew a pint . " Poordevil put on a ragged cotton shirt that Boone had given him earlier . " What 's beaver for ? " Boone asked , leading off toward the counter . " Just to spend , ai n't it ? For drinks and rifles and fixin 's ? You thinkin ' to line your grave with it ? " All Jim answered was , " That Injun can drink a sight of whisky . " From the store they went to a fire that a dozen free trappers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of meat from sides of ribs banked around the flames . " Make way for an honest-to-God man , " Summers ordered . Boone put in , " Make way for three of ' em . " From the far side of the fire a voice said , " Summers ' talk is just foolin ' , but that Caudill , now , he sounds like he sure enough believesit . " Boone squinted across and saw that the speaker was Foley , a long , strong , bony man with a lip that stuck out as if for a fight . A little silence came on everybody . Boone stood motionless . " I ai n't one to take low and go down , Foley . Make what you want out'n it . " There was the little silence again , and then Foley saying , " Plank your ass down , Caudill . You git r'iled too easy . " Summers lowered himself and put his can of whisky between his knees . " How , " the others said now . " Move in and set . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' as how he had a tool once would shoot around a corner . " " I did that . Right or left or up or down it would , and sharp or gentle , just accordin ' . Hang me , I would have it yet , only one time I got ' er set wrong , and the ball made a plumb circle and came back to the bar'l like a chicken to roost . Knocked things all to hell . " " This child shot a kind of corner onc't , " said Summers , " and I swear it saved my hair . " " So ? " Summers fired his pipe . " It was ten years ago , or nigh to it , and the Pawnees was bad . They ketched me out alone , on the Platte , and there was a passel of ' em whoopin ' and comin ' at me . First arrow made wolf 's meat of my horse , and there this nigger was , facin ' up to a party as could take a fort . "  |p201Allen  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , Dick . Sometimesbe damned if you ai n't like a dead one . " " Ai n't near so dead as some , I 'm thinkin ' . It was lucky I had Patsy Plumb here with me . " Summers patted the butt of his old rifle . " This here piece now , it do n't know itself how far it can shoot . It scares me , sometimes , dogged if it do n't , thinkin ' how the ball goes on and on and maybe hits a friend in Californy , or maybe the governor of Indiana State . It took me a spell to get on to it , but after while I 1'ar n't I could kill a goat far as I could see him , only if he was humpin ' I might have to face half-around to lead him enough . Yes , ma'am , I 've fired at critters an ' had time to load up ag'in afore ball and critter come together . " " Keeps you wore out , I 'm thinkin ' , travelin ' for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , here this child was , and the Pawnees comin ' , and just then I see a huffier about to make over a hill . He was that far away he did n't look no bigger'n a bug . I made the peace sign , quick and positive , and then I p'inted away yonder at the buffler , and the Injuns stopped and looked while I up with Patsy . I knowed ' er inside out then , and I waited until the critter 's tail switched out of sight over the hill , and then , allowin ' for a breeze and a mite of dust in the air , I pulled trigger . " Summers had them all listening . It was as if his voice was a spell , as if his lined face with its topping of gray hair held their eyes and stilled their tongues . He puffed on his pipe , letting them wait , and took the pipe from his mouth and drank just a sip from his can of whisky . " The Pawnees begun to holler again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peace sign and led ' em on , plumb over the hill . Took most of the day to git there . But just like this nigger knowed , there was Mr. Huffier , lyin ' where the ball had dropped down on him . I tell you niggers , the Pawnees got a heap respectful . One after the other , they asked could they have meat and horns and hair , figgerin ' it was big medicine for ' em , till there was n't anything left of that bull except a spot on the ground , and dogged if some of the Pawnees did n't eat that ! " Summers let a little silence come in before he spoke again . " I ai n't never tried any long shots since . " " No ? " " I figger I ai n't up to it . I swear I aimed to get that old bullp202through the heart , and there he was , plain gut-shot . Made me feel ashamed . " They laughed , and some clapped others on the back , and they dipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night while the dark gathered close around , making the fire like a little sun . In the light of it the men looked flat , as if they had only one side to them . The faces were like Indian faces , dark and weathered and red-lit now , and clean-shaved so as to look free of hair . Boone drank from his can and pushed closer to the fire , feeling the warmth of it wave out at him . Poordevil squatted behind him , seeming comfortableenough in his crotch cloth and cotton shirt . Around them were the keen night and the campfires blazing and the cries of men , good-sounding and cozy , but lost , too , in the great dark like a wolf howl rising and dying out to nothing . " I reckon you two ai n't the only ones ever shot a corner , " Jim said . " Sharp or curve ? " " Sharp as could be . A plumb turnabout . " " It 's Company firewater makes a man think things , " Allen said . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . " " In Bayou Salade it was , and we was forted up for the winter . " Jim was getting to be a smart liar  --  as good as Summers , almost . " I took a look out one morning , and there not an arrer shot away was the biggest by-God painter a man ever see . Painter meat ! ' I says and grabbed up my rifle and leveled . The painter had got itself all stretched out , and lyin ' so 's only his head made a target . I aimed for the mouth , I did , and let ' er go , only I did n't take into account how quick that painter was . " Jim looked around the circle of faces . " He was almighty quick . The ball went in his mouth fair , and then that critter swapped ends , faster'n scat . I ai n't hankered to look a painter in the tail since . " Jim fingered his cheek gently . " That bullet grazed my face , comin ' back . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden Boone found himself tired of it , tired of sitting and chewing and doing nothing . He felt a squirming inside himself , felt the whisky pushing him on . It was as if he had to shoot or run or fight , or else boil over like a pot . He saw Summers lift his can again and take the barestp203sip . Jim 's whisky was untouched beside him . Goddam them , did they think they had to mammy him ! Now was a good time , as good as any . The idea rose up in him , hard and sharp , like something a man had set his mind to before everything else . He downed his whisky and stood up . Summers looked around at him , his face askinga question . " I 'm movin ' on . " Poordevil had straightened up behind him . Summers poked Jim and made a little motion with his head , and they both came to their feet . Away from the fire Boone turned on them . " Christ Almighty ! You nee'n to trail me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dast take a few drams . Come on , Poordevil . " He turned on his heel and went on , knowing that Poordevil was at his back and Jim and Summers coming farther behind , talkingso low he could n't hear . He looked ahead , trying to make out Streak , and pretty soon he saw him , saw the white hair glinting in the firelight . The players chanted and beat on their poles , trying to mix up the other side , and the side in hand passed the cache back and forth , their hands moving this way and that and opening and closing until a man could only guess where the cache was . The singing and the beating stopped after the guess was made , and winnings were pulled in and new bets laid while the plumstonecache changed sides . Boone spoke above the whooping and the swearing . " This here 's a Blackfoot Injun , name of Poordevil , and he 's a friend of mine . " Some of the players looked up , holding up the bet making . Streak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mouth like a bullet hole and an eye that seemed to have grown up squinting along a barrel , said , " Set , Caudill . Who gives a damn ? Me , I had a pet skunk onc't , and it was n't hardly ever he 'd piss on a friend of mine , and when he did the friend like as not did n't stink no worse , but only fresher . " Lanter said , " Let 's get on with the game . " " What happened to your skunk friend ? " Jim asked . " It was goin ' on the second winter that I had him , and I was holed up with two old hunters , like o ' Lanter here , and one night old No-Pee just up and left without givin ' no reason at all . "  | " Likely his pride finally got the best of him , " Lanter said . " ' Twer' n't that . I figgered it out all right . Livin ' close up with two hard cases like you , Lanter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it no more . " Boone waited until the voices had quieted down . " I ai n't aimin ' to let no one pester Poordevil . Anyone 's got such an idee , sing out ! " In front of him a man said , " Jesus Christ ! My beaver 's nigh drunk up already . " Streak 's eyes lifted . His face was dark and his mouth tight and straight . A man could n't tell whether he was going to fight or not . Boone met his gaze and held it , and a silence closed around them with eyes in it and faces waiting . Streak got up , making out to move lazily . " The damn Blackfoot do n't look so purty , " he said to the man at his side . His glance rose to Boone . " How 'll you have it ? " " Any way . " Streak left his rifle resting against a bush and moved out and came around the players . Boone handed his gun to Jim . Summers had stepped back , his rifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side Poordevil grunted something in Blackfoot that Boone did n't understand . Streak was a big man , bigger than he looked at first , and he moved soft and quick like a prime animal , his face closed up and set as if nothing less than a killing would be enough for him . Boone waited , feeling the blood rise in him hot and ready , feelingsomething fierce and glad swell in his chest . Streak bent over and came in fast and swung and missed and caught his balance and swung again before Boone could close with him . His fist struck like a club head , high on Boone 's cheek . Boone grabbed for him , and the heavy fist struck again and again , and he kept driving into it , feeling the hurt of it like something good and satisfying , while his hands reached out and a dark light went to flashing in his head . He caught an arm and slipped and went down with Streak on top of him . A hand clamped on his throat and another clinched behind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . The fire circled around him , the fire and the players and Summers standing back with his rifle and Jim with his mouth open and his eyes squinched like he was hurting and Poordevil crouching as if about to dive in . They swung around him , mixed and cloudy , likep205something only half in the mind , while he threshed against the weight on him . He heard Streak 's breath in his ear and his own wind squeaking in and out . He caught Streak 's head in his hands and brought it down and ripped an ear with his teeth . Streak jerked the ear free , but in that instant Boone got a gulp of air , and the dizzy world steadied . He had hold of Streak 's wrists . He felt his own muscles swellingalong his forearms as he called on his strength . It was as if his hands were something to order the power into . It came a little at a time , but steady and sure  --  a little and then a wait and then a little more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then loosening more until he held Streak 's straining hands away . He called on all his strength and forced Streak 's left arm straight , and then he dropped his grip on the other and whipped his free arm across and clamped it above Streak 's elbow , straining the forearm back while he bore on the joint . The arm cracked , going out of place , and Streak cried out and wrenched himself away and lunged to his feet , his face black and twisted and his left arm hanging crooked . As he came in again , his good arm raised , Boone caught the dark flicker of a knife and heard Jim 's quick cry of warning . He had n't time to get out his own blade . As he twisted away , the knife came down and cut through his shirt , and the bite of it along his arm was like the bite of fire . He snatched at the wrist and caught it . Above the whistle of their lungs Summers ' voice came : " By God , he asked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knuckles , the clutched fingers , and caught a thumb and bent it back . He jerked the hand around under his chest and saw it weakening , one finger and another lettingup like something dying and the handle coming into sight . The knife slipped out and fell in the grass . Boone snatched it up , holding to Streak with his other hand . A word stuttered on the man 's lips , and the campfire showed a sudden look of fear in his face , a look of such fear that a man felt dirtied seeing it . The eyes flicked wide , flicked and fluttered and came wide again and closed slow as Boone wrenched the knife free and drove it in again . Boone pushed with his hand . Streak fell over backwards , making a soft thump as he hit , and lay on his back , twitching , with the knife upthrust from his chest.  |p206Poordevil  let out a whoop and began to caper around , and Jim joined in , dancing with his knees high and yelling , " Hi-ya ! " Summers ' rifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm thinking the trouble 's over , " he said , and nobody answered until Lanter spoke up with " Let 's git on with the game . The parade 's done passed . Any of you niggers want to take Streak 's place ? " Boone heard him add under his breath , " That damn Caudill 's strong as any bull . " Boone turned to Summers . " Maybe you 're ready to wet your dry now ? " " ' Pears like a time for it , after we doctor you . " " It ai n't no more'n a scratch . To hell with it ! Let 's have some fun . " Summers looked at the long cut on Boone 's arm . " Reckon it wo n't kill ye , at that . " The men went back to playing hand , leaving Streak 's body lying . Closed out from the firelight by the rank of players , it was a dark lump on the ground , like a sleeper . A man had to look sharp to see the knife sticking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after he had drunk he did n't recollect how much whisky and had had himself a woman and won some beaver . There was the taste of alcohol in his mouth , and the gummy taste of Snake tobacco . He held his arm still at his side , now that the wound had started to stiffen . He felt fagged out and peaceful , with every hunger fed except that one hankering to point north . With day coming on the land , the world was like a pond clearing . From far off on a butte came the yipping of coyotes . Suddenly a squaw began to cry out , keening for a dead Bannock probably , her voice rising lonely and thin in the half-night . A man could just see the nearest lodges , standing dark and dead . There was dew on the grass , and a kind of dark mist around Streak 's carcass , which lay just as it had before , except that some Indian had lifted the hair , thinking that that plume of white would make a fancy prize.  |p207Summers  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and Boone and Jim stood . The camp had begun to stir now that morning was floodingover the sky . Squaws were laying fires and fixing meat to cook , and so were the white hunters and company engages who did n't have a woman to do the squaw 's work . He and Boone and Jim had n't taken up with the squaws so much as the others , except for a time or two . As far as Summers knew , they had n't fathered a child either , not anywhere , though like as not they had . Already one Indian was at the counter , probably asking for whisky . Summerssaw a squaw come poking out of a lodge and after her two half-breed children , whom the French called brules on account of their burned look . He wondered whether even the squaw knew who their pappy was . Farther off , horses were running , bucking and kicking up and nipping at one another in the early chill . The sun touched the tops of the hills , but lower down the dark lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead , waiting for day to get farther along before they came to life . " Me , " said Jim , " I 'd wait and go east with the furs . " Summers did n't answer , but it went through his mind again that he did n't want to go back with anybody . He wanted to be by himself , to go along alone with the emptiness that was in him , to look and listen and see and smell , to say goodbye a thousand times and , saying it , maybe to find that the hurt was gone . He wanted to hear water at night and the wind in the trees , to take the mountainsand the brown plains sharp and lasting into his mind , to kill a buffalo and cook the boudins by his own small fire , feeling the night press in around him , seeing the stars wink and the dipper steady , and everything saying goodbye , goodbye . Goodbye , Dick Summers . Goodbye , you old nigger , you . We mind the time you came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We watched you grow into a proper mountain man . We saw you learning , trapping and fighting and finding trails , and going around then proud-breasted like a young rooster , ready for a frolic or a fracas , your arm strong and your wind sound and the squaws proud to have you under a robe . But new times are a-coming now , and new people ,  |p208a  heap of them , and wheels rolling over the passes , carrying greenhornsand women and maybe children , too , and plows . The old days are gone and beaver 's through . We 'll see a sight of change , but not you , Dick Summers . The years have fixed you . Time to go now . Time to give up . Time to sit back and remember . Time for a chair and a bed . Time to wait to die . Goodbye , Dick . Goodbye , Old Man Summers . " We did n't do so bad , " Boone said , " what with beaver so trapped out and the price what it was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had saved his hair , where better men had lost theirs . He had seen things a body never would forget and done things that would stay in the mind as long as time . He had lived a man 's life , and now it was at an end , and what had he to show for it ? Two horses and a few fixin 's and a letter of credit for three hundred and forty-three dollars . That was all , unless you counted the way he had felt about living and the fun he had had while time ran along unnoticed . It had been rich doings , except that he wondered at the last , seeing everythingbehind him and nothing ahead . It was strange about time ; it slipped under a man like quiet water , soft and unheeded but taking a part of him with every drop  --  a little quickness of the muscles , a little sharpness of the eye , a little of his youngness , until by and by he found it had taken the best of him almost unbeknownst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it back , to catch what had been borne away . It was n't that he minded going under , it was n't he was afraid to die and rot and forget and be forgotten ; it was that things were lost to him more and more  --  the happy feeling , the strong doing , the fresh taste for things like drink and women and danger , the friends he had fought and funned with , the notion that each new day would be better than the last , good as the last one was . A man 's later life was all a long losing , of friends and fun and hope , until at last time took the mite that was left of him and so closed the score . " Wisht you 'd change your mind , " Boone said . " It 'll be fat doin 's up north , Dick . " Fat doings ! Jim and Boone would n't understand until they got old . They would n't know that a man did n't give up the life but that it was the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ifp209beaver grew plenty again and the price high ? He had seen times right here on the Seeds-kee-dee when beaver were so thick a hunter shot them from the bank , and so dear that a good pack fetched nigh a thousand dollars . Such doings would n't put spring in a man 's legs or take the stiffness from his joints . They would n't make him a proper mountain man again . The sun was coming up over Sweetwater way . The first red half of it lay lazy on the skyline , making the dew sparkle on the grass . To the west the mountains stood out clean , the last of the night gone from the slopes . Summers looked east and west and north and south , hating to say goodbye . " Fair weather for you , " Jim said . " Purty . " Boone 's eyes came to his and drifted off . These were Summers ' friends , the best he had in the world , now that the bones of older ones lay scattered from Spanish territorynorth to British holdings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never was heard from again , and old Hugh Glass , put under by the Rees on the Yellowstone , and Jed Smith , who prayed to God and trusted to his rifle but died young for all of that , and Henry Vanderburgh , a sure-enough man if green , who lost his hair to the Blackfeet , and Andrew Henry , the stout oldtimer , who had died in his bed back in Washington County ; there were these and more , and they were all gone now , dead or vanished from sight , and sometimes Summers felt that , along with some like old Etienne Provot , he belonged to another time . And yet it had all been so short that looking back he would say it was only yesterday he had put out for the new land and the new life . A man felt cheated and done in , as if he had just got a taste of things before they were taken away . He no more than got some sense in his head , no more than hit upon the trick of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as his body , than his body began to fail him . The pleasures drew off , farther and farther , like a point on a fair shore , until he could only look back and remember and wish . These were his best friends , he thought again , while for no good reason he took another look at the pack and saddle andp210cinches on his two horses . They were his best friends  --  this Boone Caudill , who acted first and thought afterwards , but acted stout and honest just the same ; this Jim Deakins , who saw fun in things and made fun and had God and women on his mind . " This nigger ought n't to be takin ' your Blackie horse , " he said to Boone . " Might be you 'll need him , goin ' alone . " " I ai n't forgettin ' . " " It ai n't nothin ' . " " Not many gives away their huffier horse . " " Ai n't nothin ' . " " Wisht I had him to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was sure enough time for a mountain man to give up when his guts wrenched and water came to his eyes . " Whar 'll you camp tonight ? " What did it matter ? It was all known country to him , the Seeds-kee-dee Agie and the Sandy and the Sweetwater . There was hardly a hill he did n't know , from whatever direction , or a stream he had n't camped along . He could say goodbye to one as well as another . Leaving , a man did n't set himself a spot to make by night . There was n't anything waiting for him at the end , except a patch of ground and a mule and a plow . He would take it slow , looking and hearing and remembering , while one by one the old places faded away from him and by and by he came on the settlements , where men let time run their lives  --  a time to get up , a time to eat , a time to work , a time to be abed so 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to plow and sow and harvest . A man did n't live off the land there . He worked it like he would work a nigger , making it put out corn and pigs and garden trash . He did n't go out when he got hungry and kill himself a fat cow . He did n't see his living all around him , free for the shooting of it . He had to nurse things along , to wait and figure and save . Things pressed him all around . He had to have money in his pocket , had to dicker for this and that and pay out every turn . Without money he was n't anything . Without it he could n't live or hold his head up . Men in the settlements gave a heap of time just to trading money back and forth , each one hoping he had got thep211best of it and counting his coins and feeling good at having them , as if they were beaver or rifles . " You bound to go north ? " he asked , knowing they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll get us aplenty of beaver on the Teton and Marias and along there , " Boone explained . " If the Blackfeet 'll let you . If the Piegans ai n't trapped it out for Fort McKenzie . " " We 'll get it . " " Teal Eye would be how old now ? " Jim said , " Old enough to have a man , and young'uns , too . Eh , Dick ? " " We 'll get us beaver , " Boone said . The campfires sent up a thin blue smoke , so many campfires that a man would n't want to count them . The smoke rose straight , growing thinner while it climbed , until you could n't see it at all , but only the clear empty sky it had lost itself in . " Reckon Poordevil will stick by you ? " " Sure . " " Boone 's 1'ar n't a right smart of Blackfoot talk . " " I taken notice . " " It 'll come in handy . You 'll see . " He would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see these sights , or smell the smoke smell of quaking asp . He could hear the sharp voices of the squaws and the throaty talk of their men and the cries of children . The tones of the hunters came to him , too , and the knock of axes . He looked at the lodges standing in the glistening grass , standing clean against the blue distance . He looked at the dogs and children trotting about the lodges , at the horses done with their playing now and moving purposefully out to good pasture , at the river flowing steady between its fringe of trees , winding forever to the south to strange land he had never seen . It all was a regular town , of a kind , and it all made a smell and a sound and a picture . Could he get it again in his ear and eye and nose , once he was back in Missouri with time nudging him and his hand always feeling for money ? His eyes went to Jim and Boone . More than ever , the feeling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to leave . ItP212was as if he was casting his young'uns loose to shift for themselves and feeling uneasy at what might happen to them . " Well , " he said , " time to put out . It is , now . " He held out his hand . " This nigger ca n't make talk all day . " He got on his horse and reined it around , toward the rising sun , toward the east from which young Dick Summers had come a long , long time ago . Poordevil hung back , his face screwed up and anxious , andhis eyes searching around like the eyes of an animal that had got a whiff of danger . Jim was slewed half-around in his saddle , watching him . " Comeon , Poordevil , " he called . " If'n elk can pass along here , I reckon horses can . " Poordevil called back , " Heap , heap bad , " and went off into Indiantalk that Jim could n't understand . Jim turned around , so that his voice would carry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's he sayin ' , Boone ? " " Did n't hear , " Boone answered over his shoulder . " Say it again , Poordevil . Make loud talk . " The Indian raised his voice above the creaking of the leather , the clunk of the packs and the hollow thump of the horses ' feet . " Says it 's the doin 's of bad spirits , " Boone translated . " They put a proper name to it , all right , callin ' it Colter 's Hell . " Hell might lie underneath , sure enough , in the great unseen hole that echoed to the horses ' feet , in the fire that burned under all the land and sent water boiling out of the ground and jets of steam that hissed up and trailed off in clouds on either side of the elk trail they were following . A low stink hung over everything . North and south and east and west the ground was crusted white , like a salt desert . Unless he looked beyond , to the line of hills or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man would n't think he was in the mountains . The sun blazed on the white crust , and the crust blazed back into the eyes , so that a rider went along with his face pinched and his lids narrowed . P213Poordevil 's voice came to Jim in a sudden throaty cry , and then the sucking of a hoof and the scramble of a startled horse , and , looking back , Jim saw the hole that the hoof had made in the crust and the blue steam coming from it . " Devil nigh catched you that time , Poordevil , " he said . " It 's skeery , sure enough , Boone , " he went on , knowing Boone could n't hear him but talking all the same . " Almighty skeery . " Boone 's hunched shoulders bobbed ahead of him , looking strong and bony under the slack cotton shirt . Beneath the red handkerchief he had tied on his head , his plaited black hair swung to the gait of his horse . His eye was always looking , to right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crosswise and ready , but Jim knew it was n't the devil Boone was watching for . Boone did n't worry about hell , or heaven either , but about Blackfeet and the thieving Crows and meat and beaver . He was a direct man , Boone was , and God did n't figure with him . What he could see and hear and feel and eat , and kill or be killed by , that was what counted . That , and sometimes a crazy idea , like this notion of going on beyond the Three Forks where the Blackfeet were thicker than gnats and always hungry for the Long Knives ' scalps . Beaver , Boone said he was after , but Jim knew better . It was little Teal Eye , held secret in Boone 's head all this time , and all the time growing and taking hold of him , until finally his mind was made up and God himself could n't change him . It was a crazy idea , all right , crazy as could be . Even Bridger , bound just for the upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was taking a parcel of men with him so 's to be safe . Jim and Boone and Poordevil made only three . And what if Poordevil was a Blackfoot himself , as Boone argued ? That did n't mean the Blackfeet would hold off . Jourdonnais had figured the same way , having Teal Eye with him , but he was dead just the same . Sometimes Jim wondered why he hung along with Boone . There was n't much fun in Boone . He was a sober man , and tightmouthed , without any give in him unless it was with Summers . Go with Boone and you went his way . A man would think Boone would be satisfied now , having his own say-so about going north , but still he fretted because they took it slow and easy according to the promise Jim had finally pinched out of him . There was no sense inP214hurry , not with boiling springs to be seen and the great canyon of the Yellowstone and other doings that a body could n't believe . It was only high summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were fat and purple on the lower slopes , and higher up the wild raspberriesshone red along the ground . There was meat on hill and hollow , and the sun shone round and warm , and the wind had slackened , saving up for fall . It was a time to loaf , being as beaver was n't good now anyhow . Boone was a true man , regardless , cool and ready when there was danger about . He did n't know what it was to be affrighted . And you could depend on him , no matter what . There were n't many would stand as steady with a friend , or go with him as far , or stick through thick and thin . For all that he gave in to Boone , Jim felt older and a heap wiser and he knew that Boone depended on him . Some ways , Boone was like a boy still , needing just a careful word to be dropped to see things right and wise . Shooting buffalo or catching beaver or fighting bear , Boone was as good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did n't know how to joke and give and take and see things from different sides and to find fun instead of trouble . All he knew was to drive ahead . Sometimes when he was about to get himself in a fix , on account of not taking time to think , a little piece of talk , said so as to seem offhand , would set him right and steady him or maybe hold him back . Jim reckoned Boone was grateful , as a boy would be grateful without having words to say so . Jim squirmed in his saddle to watch Poordevil . The grin was gone from the broad and foolish face . You would n't know he was a merry one to see him now . His mouth was tight shut , closing the hole in his upper jaw , and his black eyes kept moving , seeing a spiritunderneath every squirt of water and every puff of steam . Jim bet if a man nudged his hind end unbeknownst , he would jump clear off his horse . " I reckon God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse , watchingone long ear slant back to listen . " Could be , do n't you reckon ? God must like to get off by Himself sometimes and caper . Must get mighty tiresome , keepin ' tally on folks and gettin ' the sun up and tuckin ' it in bed and bringin ' the rain on and all , and all the time actin ' stiff and proper . " That surely was it . God must like to throwHimself around some and be silly if He felt like it . So He came here , to the top of the world where the rivers met , and cavorted about and blew steam out of holes and squirted water just to show Himselfwhat He could do , like a boy playing and no one to see him . Thinking that way made a man feel friendlier toward God . Most folks made God out to be a mean somebody , putting notions in people 's heads and sending them to hell if they acted according . God must have aimed for a man to enjoy himself , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and when a man pleasured himself , he was doing what God expected all along . P215Where was the sense in it otherwise ? Why were squaws so manyand so easy , if not for a purpose ? You could n't tell , though , the different ideas there were . Maybethe folks were right who thought God just tempted men to be sinful , meaning to roast them forever and ever for doing what He had given them a weakness for . Maybe He aimed to trip them up . Or maybe it was the devil kept a man sinning . You could n't tell whereone left off and the other took up . Do what God gave you a taste for and the devil got you ; do n't do it and God took you to heaven . It all sounded against nature , but men believed it and a man couldn'ttell . After a while the white crust and the boiling water gave way totangled pines , and the pines later to a plain with clumps of trees on it . To the south and west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with little circles running from the rising trout . Boone checked his horse and raised his rifle and shot an elkthat had just poked out of a clump of trees . The elk jumped once and fell and lay thrashing . " Likely place to camp , " Boone said as heset about reloading his rifle . " Heap bad , " said Poordevil , his eyes fixed on another hot springthat sent up a feather of steam . " Heap good , you goddam Injun , " Boone said . " Love hell , me . Love hell heap . We got meat , and hot water to cook with , and we ai n't like to be bothered with Blackfeet here , bein 's they do n't likeit no better than you . " He got off his horse and went over to bleed the elk and cameback and began to take off his saddle , looking around at Poordevil and grinning while his hands worked at the leather . P216They tethered the horses and cooked elk meat and boiled a can of coffee , and afterward Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky . The sun was gone , and dark was beginning to creep on the wooded slopes beyond the lake , but the sky was clear and light yet and the lake lay bright against its edging of earth and timber , like a piece fallen from above . To the east the sun lingered on the very tops of the mountains . Up there a man could see the ball of it yet and get some heat from its shine , but from where they sat Jim could see only a little cloud that it had set afire as it passed . He hunched his shoulders inside his shirt as he felt the evening chill coming on . Overhead , from somewhere or everywhere , there was a high , fine singing . Only when a man was quiet did he hear it , but there it was then , thin and coming on and fading and coming on again , and it might have been the high pines talking , or the mountains , or time humming , far off and old , so that a body felt little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for people so 's to forget how big the world was , so 's not to be thinking how long a mountain lived . The air was so quiet that the fire smoke climbed straight as a stem . Jim could hear the fire murmuring at the wood and once in a while the sound of a grazing horse , but that was all , except for the thin singing . He wished for Summers , with his gray eye and slow smile and his easy , knowing way . A body never was so sad and lonesome like this with Summers around . Summers understood how a man felt , and he understood animals and nature , too , and they all seemed to fit together with him and make him at home wherever . Jim could tell that Boone missed him , too , being even silenter than usual and straight-mouthed , with no ear or tongue for small talk . It was as if something was lost to them when Summers left , something that helped to make a trapper 's life good and satisfying . Jim asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone and half-starved for folks and sometimes at night having the deep , secretfear of death with him like something that shared his bed and pricked him away from sleep ; but he knew he would keep on for a while anyway , no matter why . A hunter 's life was a good-enough life if you were n't cut out especial for something else . After a spell you grew into it and just kept going , not knowing anything better . Probably people on farms or in stores or on the river levees got almightysick of one another and wanted to get off by themselves . ForP217all that he liked company , there was n't anything could be more tiresomethan people . He sat half-dozing , letting his ears listen . And then he heard Boone say , " Sheepeaters , likely , " and he sat up and saw four figures at the edge of the woods behind him . When Boone got up , his rifle in his hand , they melted back into the trees . Boone put his rifle down and stood silent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a line , all of them looking and all waiting . " I 'll see , " Jim said . He arose and started toward them without his rifle , wondering if they knew the peace sign , wondering if they could understand his Shoshone talk . He kept a smile on his face and moved slow , and by and by motioned them to come to him . They were a man and a squaw , he saw now , and two young ones , and they stood uncertain and curious , wanting to dart back into the trees but wanting to see more , too . A little flutter of uneasiness went over them as he drew closer , and he stopped , waiting for them to get used to him , as a hunter would have waited to calm down his game . " The white brother 's heart is good , " he said in Snake . " The white brother has but one mouth and one tongue . " They listened , understanding but still wary , standing pale in their bighorn skins against the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand . Four dogs carrying packs slipped from behind them and saw Jim and growled and then sat down . After a while , as he stood silent , the dogs began to grin . It all might have been a picture except for the little movement , the Indian 's eyes going over him and the squaw watching and puttingout her hands to stay the little ones , and the little ones , forgettingfright , making small , jerky motions like sandpipers . " The white brother has meat . Will his brothers eat ? " Jim could see the thought working in their heads . Their eyes were still now , and fastened on him as a man might fasten a glass on a distant thing , but fastened inward , too , on the food that he offered . " The red powder and tobacco and beads and a medicine glassto look in . " Jim motioned behind him , toward the fire . The squaw said something low-voiced to her man , and they tooka forward step , still watchful and uneasy , but venturesome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sat down there withP218Boone and Poordevil , and all of them looked away toward the lake in which a slow cloud floated . No one spoke or peeked until the Indiangave a little grunt , and they turned about to see them standing , open-faced and simple , the man on one side and the squaw on the other , with the two children in between . Jim took a brand from the fire and touched it to his pipe and pointed the stem up and down and around and held it for the Indian . After he had puffed on it , the Indian held out an old and batteredfusil , with the pan open and rusted , pointing to it to show he lacked powder and ball . A three-foot sheep's-horn bow ornamented with quills hung from his arm . Jim took lead from his pouch and poured powder from his horn into the Indian 's chipped one . The man smiled then and began to make Snake talk . Pretty soon the squaw was talking , too , and the young ones chirping . " That old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boone said . " And take a look at the arrer . These is Poordevils , sure enough . Got a stone head , it has . " He dug into his possibles and brought out a small looking glass backed with paper , and handed it to the squaw . She looked into it and made a sudden little noise and smiled to see herself . The children crowded into her and gazed at themselves . Their eyes went to hers , asking questions ; for no reason at all they broke out laughing , high and clear like bells . They darted around to the other side of the fire and smelled the meat and pointedto it , wanting some . Not until then did the man seem to notice Poordevil , but when he did his eyes widened suddenly and narrowed , and he made a motion as if to push his family back .. " Do n't be skeered , " Jim said , and switched to Shoshone . " The Blackfoot has traveled far with us . He is a brother . He wants peace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on his anxious look long enough to give a smile . The Sheepeater studied Poordevil a while longer and then , as if his fright was over , began talking again . Did the white brother have tobacco ? Did he have a knife or an awl ? Would he trade ball and powder ? Did he want the skins of the beaver or the otter ? Beaver were few in the streams now because the Indians had had to make meat of them . They had saved a few skins . The four dogs were haunched around the fire , smelling the elk meat while their tongues hung out dripping . The Indian went toP219one of them and from the travois to which it was hitched took a small bundle of furs . He dropped it at Jim 's feet . " Beaver and otter , " Jim said to Boone . The Indian said , " They belong to the white man . Give us what you like . " When they had traded and eaten they moved off , happy at havinga butcher knife and an awl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the laugh of the little ones came to Jim after they were lost from sight , and by littles thinned to an echo and then were gone . Afterward , when night had closed in , Jim lay on his back facing a sky prickled with stars . It was like the beginning of the world here , high and lonesome and far off from men 's doings , and the Sheepeaters might have been the first people , shy and simple and full of trust when their fright was gone . The beginning of the world , with the fine singing filling the sky and the boiling water sounding low , and a man wondering how things got started , and was God sitting on one of the stars , looking down and maybe grinning or maybe frowning ? A man felt lost if he let his mind run , lost under the sky , lost in the high hills , lost and as good as dead already while time flowed on and on forever . " Boone , " Jim asked , " you taken notice that Poordevil 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep . Jim wished he had a woman . It kept a man 's mind close to himself . Boone lay on his belly , screened by the quaking asp that grew on the nub of a hill . Before him rolled the great Yellowstoneplain , dipping and rising and stretching on until the sky curved down and closed it off . Far away , so that it seemed like the ragged shadow of a cloud moving across the sun , he could see a herd of buffalo headed out from water to the rich brown grass of the slopes , now that the afternoon was cooling off . Closer , half a dozen antelopes played , moving quick and delicate like flutters in the wind . The sun bore down on the back of his neck and spread on out over the plain , making a warm tan of it like the summer coatP220of the weasel . Earlier , for all that the time was early fall and the wild plums were ripening , the heat waves had danced out of the dust , and animals kept to the shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cool breath came off the mountains . Mosquitoes buzzed around him , and one big blue fly that acted as if it expected him to die any minute . He wondered whether , if he lay still enough , the fly would blow him . How did a fly know when a critter was dead ? Maybe the fly was like Jim , figuring there was more than a chance he would go under , but not scolding over it the way Jim had done . " It 's risky , Boone , " Jim had said , " and onnecessary to boot . " " I 'll be all right , I said . " " Sure . Sure . You 'll be all right , except maybe dead . Or maybe the Crows hot on our tail , and us only three and strange to these here parts besides . Crows ai n't squaws , you know , or dogs . They kin fight . " " Wo n't let ' em sight me . They ca n't fight what they do n't see . " Jim shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It ai n't safe to let you out alone . " " Do n't want you along . This is one man 's work . " Poordevil sat before the early-morning fire . His big nose squatted down at the tip as his mouth spread into a grin . " Me big thief , " he said . " Damn fine thief . Catch ' im horse quick . " " Me catch ' im horse , " Boone answered . " I 'll be back , come dark , " he said to Jim , and then he had left them camped snug where the Yellowstone began to come out of the mountains . He had known Jim 's uneasy gaze followed him as he rode away . Behind Boone , where the asp was thicker , his horse moved , cracking the twigs , and he looked around to make sure it was all right . The horse looked back at him , sleepy-eyed and dull , while its tail waved at the mosquitoes . It was Summers ' old horse , Poky , a slow animal but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the thing for what he aimed to do . He sent his eye back to the plains , seeing the buffalo again and the antelopes and the sunshine lying long on the grass , but mostly he kept his gaze on the Crow village that lay not a halfmileaway . It was a fair-sized camp , being forty lodges , he figured , and it was coming to life now with the heat cooling . He sawP221squaws scraping skins and carrying wood , or chasing the no-good dogs that would pull the wood in if only you could catch one of them . Sometimes when the wind stilled he could hear the squaws screeching at the dogs like magpies . The smoke of fires was rising here and there and bending and going off with the breeze . Men moved from one lodge to another , making plans for a hunt , maybe , or for a war party , or bragging on themselves or maybe just talking . Greenhorns thought Indians always talked high and solemn , but that was just when they were holding palaver ; around camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes so dirty that even a trapper noticed it . The men 's hands moved as they talked . A bunch of horses was drifting out to grass , cropping on the way . Boone studied them , one by one , trying to search out the best . There were some smart horses in the herd , the smart ones mostly hobbled and having to walk short or to lift up and lunge to get anywheres . After a while he settled on the horse he wanted . It was a red horse with a narrow blaze and a deep chest and legs quick and slender , and it carried itself proud . An Indian would n't trade off a horse like that , not for anything , even if the horse was n't white or speckled . About the only way to get a war horse was to steal it . Boone lay still , waiting on time . A man got so he could lie patient and quiet as a hunting cat , not pushing against time but letting it run while the sun shone on him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tree or a chunk of earth , except that his mind looked back and forward and made pictures inside his head . Old Chief Heavy Otter would prize that red horse , he reckoned . He saw himself offering it , with the painter skin he had got from the Utahs falling rich across its back . There was nobody knew how to dress skins like the Utahs . And he had vermilion , too , and tobacco aplenty , and powder and ball . He was a good hunter and a brave warrior , and his heart was good toward the Blackfeet . He would help the chief when he grew old and be a son to him and keep meat in his lodge when the chief 's arm was weak with the arrowand his legs too stiff for the hunt . While he watched , the red horse took a sudden fright and shied out and ran lunging with the hobbles , but moving fast and easy just the same , and then stoppingwith his head high and turned , and the sun shining white onP222the blaze . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to like him . He could see Teal Eye , not like she was but grown and rounded now , but still with the big eyes and the slender face , and eagerness in her like in a bird . It was strange how a hankering got into a man and stayed with him and finally pointed him in a certain direction . Maybe it was that he would n't want Teal Eye now . Maybeit was only a notion that would go away when he saw her . MaybeTeal Eye had a man already , and a lodge full of young ones . Anyhow , he and Jim and Poordevil would find beaver , a many of them , in country that other trappers feared to hunt . The white hunter had brought the good red horse as a gift , and he had brought the painter skin and powder and lead to Heavy Otter to show he loved the Blackfeet . The blue fly lit on his hand and flexed itself up and down while its fat tail looked for a place to lay . Boone brushed it away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circled his head , not giving up . Could a fly know when a man was going to be meat and to lie for the wolves and worms and the quick gray bugs that worked deep in the stink ? That was something that Jim would think about and have an idea for . Jim thought a heap  --  too much for a good mountain man  --  going along sometimes and not seeing anything except what was in his head . Jim was a smart one , all right , only Boone did n't see any sense in pestering himself with things he could n't do anything about . The mind dug into a thing and got itself tired and cranky and then had to back out the same hole it had gone in . The slow afternoon wore on . The sun inched down , no longer shining on his neck but just peeking through the trees , making a speckle of light and dark . A striped squirrel , no bigger than a mouse , flirted along a log close to him , its eye big and moist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a surprised squeak and dived from sight and by and by came back to look at him again , as if to make sure he was real . Patches of shade appeared on the plain . Out from each lodge a pointed shadow lay . Nowhere in all the sky was there a cloud . The breeze had stopped . Even the nervous leaves of the quaking asp hung sleeping . A man having work to do tonight would want to get it done before the moon came out , if he could . He would want to get it done and be away , so 's to meet up with Jim and Poordevil , waiting westward andP223ready for an early start in the morning . Likely Jim was thinking now about hot springs and mud boiling up and the great canyon of the Yellowstone and the yellow rock that gave the river its name ; likely he was thinking about them and other queer doings and trying to find where God figured in it all . The red horse had hobbled out a piece from the rest . While Boone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A good horse , he was , with strong , clean lines and a sure , high manner . A man came riding out from the camp and cast his eye around and saw nothing and after a while turned and went back , thinking all was well . Boone reckoned the Crows would bunch the horse herd closer before night , but it did n't seem likely they would stake them or post a guard , not while they felt so safe . The sun fell behind a mountain , and the sky turned a deeper blue , and the mosquitoes began to swarm sure enough , but the big blue fly was gone , maybe hunting a likelier place or maybe chilled and discouraged and squatted down somewhere . Behind Boone the tail of old Poky kept up a steady swishing . Boone put his head on his hands and slept a little , slept lightly as an animal , with his ear cocked for sound and his mind on the edge of wakefulness . He stirred at the time he had set and studied the camp and plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the horses looked of one color and the campfires winked red . He could make out the one horse , though , still off a ways from the rest and still nibbling at the grass . Three or four men , now , could make off with the whole herd , he reckoned , but he did n't want a war party on his tail . He wanted just one horse , and then to be away , across the Yellowstone and on towards the Missouri . Three riders came out and rounded up the horses and headed them toward camp , yelling to make them move . Boone kept his eye on the red horse . He would know him now in the dark , as long as he could see the lines of him . With the riders gone , the bunch loosened while he watched , still nosing out for grass . The red horse pointed towards Boone , grazing independent of the rest . If he stayed where he was , or close by , Boone figured he could go to him in the deep dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him like an owl . There was hardly a rock or a hump or a rabbit track he did n't know after lying there looking all afternoon . The horses grew into a darker blackness in the black of nightP224and by and by were lost to sight . Overhead the stars began to shine , not bright and alive but sleepy , opening dim on the darkness . Boone got up and stretched his muscles and went back to Poky . He stroked the bare back before he untied him . A saddle could give a man away . He led Poky down the slope , his moccasinedfeet feeling under him the trail he had marked while the sun was up . At the bottom he halted , smelling for the wind . A breeze from the east , now , would be the thing , or no breeze at all . A west wind or a south one would take the smell of him to the horses and to the Indian dogs . The air played about him , coming first one way and then another , but then steadying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished . It was a good sign . The wind blowing as a man wanted it was a good sign . He held his old horse short and moved on , aiming toward where he had last been able to make out the red horse . The night crowded thick all around ; he had n't a tree or a rock to go by , or the top of a hill against the sky , but only what he had put in his head while he had lain watching , only what his feet and his hands felt . Still , by a clump that raised out of the blackness when he was nearly on it , or a slope that dropped away under his moccasins , he knew that he was right . He pulled up his horse now and got to the off side of it , so 's to be shielded from the herd , or from Crows if there were any about . The old horse stepped ahead , slow and easy like a free animal , answering to the hand under his neck as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blew steady , flowing out of the northeast and over the camp to Boone . The sounds of a dogfight came to him , and then a man 's voice and the thump of a club and the keen yelp of hurt . Maybe he expecting company so soon after sundown . It was here that the red horse should be , he told himself , but there was no horse about  --  only the grass whispering to his steps , only the dark and the emptiness . The herd had drifted after night settled down . He would have a time finding the red horse , with the bunch shuffled and the night so black a man could n't see his hand . He held up , thinking , trying to sharpen his eyes to the darkness , and then , eastward , he saw a pale bulge of light that told the moon was coming up , the moon that would show him theP225horses and that might show him to the Crows . He squatted down , holding the lead rope while old Poky stood quiet , waiting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . A wolf was howling from the west , and closer by the coyotes yipped , and all at once the Indian dogs began to answer , barking deep and highpitchedand hoarse and shrill , and quieting all at once , too , while the wolf and the coyotes kept on . The moon got its edge over the world , and by and by the fat bulge of it , and then lay red and swollen , as if resting up beforestarting its journey across the sky . Even so , it cast a light , making big , deep patches on the land . Boone could see the red fires in it , could see it turning lazy like a ball turning . It climbed an inch or two , no longer resting on the line of earth but sailing , the flames going from red to yellow like a campfire getting hot . Things began to grow out of the darkness , a clump of bushes close at hand , the swell of a little hill , and the weaving black line the trees made yonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse herd , moved in now toward camp . He started the old horse then , letting it plod along like a stray coming back to the bunch while he hid himself at the side . He must n't hurry ; slow was the caper . Easy , hoss , easy . Goddam the cactus ! He knew without looking that he had come up to the horses . It was as if he could hear them staring at him , as if he could hear them standing with their ears pointed and their nostrils wide , though all he heard were the little sounds of the village and all he saw were the slow legs of Poky and the earth passing under his feet . He looked under Poky 's neck and saw a horse reared before him as if it had sprung out of the ground . The breath rattled in its nose . He stopped Poky and waited , not wanting to pass the horse and so give him his scent . The horse snorted again , shorter and lighter this time , and then turned and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They rolled up as he neared , resting on their bellies with their heads high and watchful . He slowed his own horse to a bare creep , letting the herd look and listen and smell for him . To the side of the others he spotted the red horse , spotted the fine line of his back and the high head , and he eased toward him ,  |p226kee|ping  behind Poky , peeking under the old neck . The red horse 's nostrils fluttered in a little sound , and his feet moved nervously , but he did n't turn to run . Poky knew the horse Boone wanted . Once pointed that way , he kept on , moving one heavy foot and then another , narrowing the distance as the red horse watched . They touched noses , the breath of the red horse drawing in in a long tremble . Boone slipped under Poky 's neck , trying to move fast without seeming fast . His hand flipped the end of the rope over the arch of the neck . The red horse snorted loud and reared and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the rope beneath the throat . Boone held on while the horse lunged . His breath said , " Whoa , now ! Whoa ! Ai n't nothing going to hurt you , boy . " His arms started from their sockets as his body jerked ahead . His legs leaped to keep up and then fell behind and dragged in the dirt . " Whoa , you snorty bastard ! " The words came out in grunts . " Whoa , now ! " He caught his feet and held still while the horse stood stiff and scared . " Whoa , boy ! " His hand went out and stroked the neck , feeling the muscles quiver . After a minute the red horse let himself be pulled over to Poky . The other horses had run and faced about . He could see the fronts of them , rising tall and stiff . He could hear their forefeet stamp a challenge and the breath snorting into their lungs . Even against the wind the village might have heard them . Maybeit could hear them now if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pry into the darkness , letting his ears feel for sound . After a while , at the very end of his sight , he caught movement . It could be a wolf . It could be a Crow who had heard the noise of the horses and had come out alone , hoping maybe to get a scalp and so be able to brag on himself . It could be one of a parcel of Crows . Anyhow , he 'd have to wait . There was n't time for a getaway . With the moon higher now and the light touching things up , even a poor shot could knock him from his horse . Boone stepped the red horse around , so as to be in his shadow . He stooped and ran the free end of the lariat under the hobbles and , pulling strong and slow , brought the head down and tied a knot to hold it there . He carried a pistol in his belt , but if there was work to be done it was work for the knife . He brought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadow of the horse and squinted under its belly . He put his hand up and stroked the horse 's shoulder , wanting to keep him from fighting the rope . The horse strained against it , not wild , though , but easy , as if trying the knot . The head came around then and took a long quivering smell of Boone . The movement had stopped , and whatever had made it was melted into the darkness . When it came to Boone 's eye again it was like the darkness dividing , like a piece breaking off and going on by itself . It was just one Indian walking , a bold Indian walking by himself , going slow and watchful . It could be he would pass by if Boone held still and the red horse behaved himself . The Crow stepped careful , his face showing vague against the shine of the moon , his heart hoping , likely , to find a Blackfoot and to kill him and take the hair . A Crow scalp would be a pretty thing , now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . The white hunter was a friend of the Blackfeet . He had fought their enemies and put them under . Here was a scalp to show that he spoke true . Boone 's hand felt in the grass and found a rock . He pitched it over the Crow 's head and heard it thump and saw the Indian switch about . He ducked under the horse and heard it kick at him and felt the hoof grazing his hip . And then he was up , runningsoft and fast . He leaped as the Indian turned . His left arm went around the neck under the chin and clamped off the cry that struggled in the throat . His right arm drove the knife deep . It was over almost before a man could say Godamighty . An Indian was n't a match for a white man , not for a real man with two good arms . The Crow stiffened and went limp , and his knees folded under him . Boone let him sink . Before he ran the circle with his knife and ripped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red horse had thrown himself , trying to run , and lay thrashing on his side . Poky had n't stirred a step . The herd had galloped off . Boone seemed to remember that they had made quite a ruckus doing it . The wind blew steady , though , and the sounds from camp were the small sounds of calm . He stuffed the scalp under his belt . The hair on it was long , as Crows ' hair was , reaching down , maybe , to the back of the knees . He went to the red horse and untied the lariat and cut the hobbles . The horse struggled to his feet . " Steady , boy . " HeP228climbed on old Poky and headed west , leading the other horse , keeping to the shadows and the swales while his ears listened . The noises still were little noises . Even the dogs went silent after a while except for a halfhearted bark now and then . When a patch of timber closed him off from the village , Boone put Poky to a trot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind and luck and a pair of arms a man could take a rightful pride in . It was n't safe to let him out alone , was n't it ? The Crows would get him , or come chasing after ? Risky , Jim had said it was , and unneccesary ; but his scalp was still on and no one trailed him , and at the end of the lead rope trotted such a piece of horseflesh as anyone would itch for . The white hunter would be a son to Heavy Otter and would keep meat in his lodge and fight his enemies . The white hunter was a great warrior . Here was a scalp fresh-taken from the Crows . And here was a buffalo horse as fast as the wind and stout and long-enduring as the moose deer . The buffalo horse was Heavy Otter 's , it and the painter skin and the tobacco and the red earth for the face and the powder and ball . The white hunter wanted the daughter of Heavy Otter for his squaw . It was stern country they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high and chill at night , swept by westernwinds . Sometimes in the mornings the frost lay white-grained on the grass . The wild plums that hung rich and ready on the Yellowstonehad petered out , along with the salt weed that kept the horses stout in wintertime . Already the chokecherries dripped black , soft and sweetened by the frost , and a man going along would strip himself a handful and chew the flesh loose and blow the seeds out , making a tube of his tongue , aiming at a leaf or a chip along the way . Boone pulled up on a hill . " Whar 's your brothers , Poordevil ? " Poordevil grinned . " All gone . " " Beats me , " Jim put in . " Here we are , long acrost the Yellowstoneand nigh to the Tree Forks , and nary a Injun about . "   " Ai n't saw an Injun since I stoled the red horse . " Boone looked back at the horse . With his mane roached and his tail combed he made a pretty sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trail-wise , and a man taking note of his quick ears and delicate nose and watching eyes would know when to go careful . " If it 's Piegans hunt the Three Forks , where in hell are they , Poordevil ? " Poordevil was a Blood , himself , but he ought to know where the Piegans hunted . They were all Blackfeet together . " A man gets chilly quick , " Jim said , " with that wind blowin ' . Cools out the horses in a shake . " His hand felt the neck of his horse , which was stiff where the sweat had dried . " Be winter soon , " Boone answered . He let an edge come into his voice . " We 're behind time , what with all our foolin ' around . " " It did n't help any , turnin ' east to steal the red horse , " Jim said quickly . " We could have hit straight up the Madison . " When Boone spoke again it was to say , " Blackfeet 's bound to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huffier . Or east . " " Time 's past . They ought to be back on the river . " Boone clucked to his horse . Poky stepped slow , always taking his time while he kept his head down watching the footing . The red horse came along light and easy , hardly needing the line on his neck . The country stayed empty , except for dumb brutes and varmints . There were deer and elk about and wolves and coyotes and , on the little prairies , rabbits big as jackasses that bounced away half-flying . Already they were changing from gray-brown to white , so 's to be hard to see against the snow . The long-billed curlew had flocked and gone , leaving in Boone 's head the echo of its rising cry . He would hear it in his mind and see the Indians running at him again , and Jourdonnais falling with the hole in his chest , and Painter clinging high and fuzzed up on the mast of the Mandan . He would see Teal Eye , too , not with the Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare hills of home . The great meadowlarks had ceased their autumn singing , though they flushed out from underfoot sometimes , bigbodiedas the bobwhite he remembered from long ago . The young ducks swam four and five and six along the streams , waiting for the storm that would send them south . In the beaverP230ponds the winter 's store of cottonwood and quaking asp stood ready , poked in the mud against the time ice held the beavers under . For all that beaver sign was plenty , they had n't trapped much . Sometimes when they camped on the edge of dark Jim put traps out , and made his lift early in the morning , but mostly they passed by the ponds , Boone being set and pointed now and keeping the others on the go . Not hide nor hair of an Indian anywhere , but they still traveled careful , wanting to choose their own time and way of meeting . Often they made cold camps after cooking when the sun was high and smoke and flame were harder to see . If they built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead afterwardfor a mile or so before making camp . Many a man had gone under because he was n't careful that way . The country climbed and fell and rolled away in such great sweeps that a man sometimes felt small as any ant . It was a country of stone and timber and quick , clear creeks and the Gallatin rushingthrough it , turning and twisting , and the noise of it beating steady against the ears . Lower down , the river slid into the mixed waters of the Madison and Jefferson , making the Missouri sure enough . Here was the heart of Blackfoot land , the Three Forks , where many a hunter had died , where even big parties did n't like to go , knowing war parties would be after them thick and fierce as hornets ; but there were no Indians about them now , only signs of them , only cold campfires and gnawed bones where villages had stood and old clumps of sod the squaws had dug to hold the lodge skins down . Upstream to where the Madison and Jefferson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . " Might as well turn about and foller the Missouri north , " Boone said . " Injuns are bound to be somewheres . " Lying awake at night , hearing the sound of water and the wind in the trees , seeing the dipper sitting close and steady , he told himself the Piegans were sure to be about . A nation did n't just up and leave a country . He would find the Piegans and Heavy Otter 's band . He would find Teal Eye , or learn what had happened to her . There was n't anything hard about it or out of reason . The first Piegan they met would know where Heavy Otter was . A mountain man could find his way anywhere , to anybody . He could set out looking for a friend he had n't seen in a coon 's age , and he could point his way to him , overP231the mountains and across the rivers and through the timbers , as Boone had done himself more than once before . It was only time that made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betweenthat made Teal Eye seem like someone he had built up in his head . It was the red horse that took notice first , just a jump beyond the Three Forks . He pricked his ears and snorted softly . Slower to catch on , the others plodded along until by and by they lifted their heads , too , and looked and whiffed the air , and all of them slowed and came to a halt . Ahead of him Boone heard the cackling of magpies . Jim said , " Probably no more'n a bear . " Poordevil 's blunt nose was pointed up and his face was squeezed together as if all his senses were bent ahead . " Sick , " he said . " Smell sick . Smell goddam dead . " Except for the magpies , though , there was n't a sound . There was n't a wisp of smoke . Boone 's nose found nothing except the smell of horse and pine . " Easy ! " he said , and started on . Around a belt of trees the village came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all seeming dead . Not so much as a dog moved among them , and no horses grazed about . A puff of wind blew from the lodges and carried to Boone . " Holy Christ ! " The stink on the wind was like a blow in the face . Jim 's hand went up and closed his nose . " Whew ! " he said , andspit over the shoulder of his horse as if the smell was in his mouth . The magpies , which had quieted at the first sight of them , tookup their racket again when they saw the horses did n't come on . " Piegan camp , Poordevil ? " Boone asked . " All goddam gone . " " Been a fight , maybe , and all went under . " " Sick . Smell sick . " " Best not go closer , Boone . Hear ? " " I aim to see . " " The stink 's enough to sicken a man . I 'm fixin ' to puke a'ready . " " Bad , " said Poordevil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Boone dropped from his horse and started ahead , carrying hisrifle . The magpies quieted again , and one by one flapped off , scoldingas they went . P232Two coyotes slid from among the lodges and slunk away , lookingfull-bellied and heavy , as Boone approached . The stink made a man 's hair rise . He breathed short and quick , not wanting to get the air deep in him . He pulled the flap of a lodge wider and closed it quick , snortingthe smell from his nose . He made himself pull it open again and look in while the rotten air from inside poured over him . There were three bodies there , chewed some by coyotes , looking so black and bloated a man would have taken them for extra-fat niggers . In another lodge it was the same , except there was just one Indian in it , sprawled dead and black , the flesh puffing tight against his clothes . A squaw rested on her back outside another , and a young one alongside her . The magpies had been busy on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead and gone , put under by a sickness , men and squaws and young ones lying stiff and bloated , and some with their eyes pecked out by birds , leaving pockets in the dead fat faces that maggots worked in . He heard a thin whimpering , like a pup weak and hurt , and followed the sound of it and came to another tepee in which he saw a boy lying . The boy 's face was one solid scab . " How ? " There was a dead squaw inside the lodge and a dead buck to one side , likely the boy 's parents . " How ? " The thin whimpering kept on , trembling out with the boy 's breath and stopping while he drew in and then trembling out again . Boone raised his voice . " What ails you ? " It occurred to him that he had been talking white talk . He thought out some Blackfoot , shouting so 's to get it through to the boy 's mind . Only the whimpering answered him , and it growing weaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiffened and the scabbed mouth fell open . The lungs let out a long shuddering breath , snatched once at the air and then gave up . Boone backed out of the entrance , feeling his nostrils shrunken and his belly crowding close in his throat . He walked beyond the tepees into the wind , letting his lungs drink . At the edge of the camp he passed the bodies of a man and a squaw , part-eaten but not black or scabbed . Each had a knife wound in the chest . Blackened with blood , the knife lay close by the man 's hand . P233After a while Boone turned and walked back into the stink . He made himself look into every lodge , made himself look at every woman 's face . The lodge skins were brown and thin with time , so that light came through them as it could n't come through new ones . Some of the lodges were empty , but partly readied up all the same , with robes lying in them or a kettle or a can standing or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the owners expected to come back directly , or as if they had taken a sudden fright and run away , snatching up what they could carry . A man could n't tell one face from another , swollen the way they were and scabbed , and sometimeseaten on . There was n't one person alive . The boy had been the last . He walked back to where Jim and Poordevil sat . They had got tired waiting and had unforked from their horses to sit on the ground . To the question in their eyes he answered , " All dead . Every damn livin ' soul dead . " " Sick , " said Poordevil , nodding . The slot showed between his grinning lips as he came out with " Petite verole . La petite verole . You betcha . " " You hear that , Boone ? French talk for smallpox ! " " I heerd it . " " God Almighty ! Reckon he knows what he says ? " " Could be . " " You been doctored so 's not to catch it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A man do n't take it twice . " " How about you , Poordevil ? You catch ' im ever ? Petite verole ? " Poordevil 's face was one big smile . Everything was a joke to that fool Indian , except Colter 's Hell . He bobbed his head and pointed to pits that lay along his hair line . " Best I stayed away , I reckon , " Jim said . " There was a squaw and her man stabbed , " Boone told Jim . " I do n't git the reason of that . And some of the lodges are empty , with fixin 's left around . " " That would be people runnin ' away from the smallpox , Boone . " " What about the stabbed ones ? " P234Jim 's eyes studied the ground . The stubble on his chin was a match for the hair of the red horse . " Could be they were Injuns that knew they had to die and wanted to do it quick . Could be they kilt themselves . " " Could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Jim went on . " That 's why we ai n't met up with Blackfeet . They 're all dead , likely , and them as ai n't are runnin ' from the smallpox . " " A whole nation do n't die . " " A whole camp did , all the same . " " Not all of them . Some run away . " " You reckon that 's Heavy Otter 's band , Boone ? " Boone did n't answer . " You reckon , Boone ? " A crow coasted over them , throwing a shadow on the grass , and let itself down among the lodges . " I say , you reckon that 's Heavy Otter 's band ? " " How 's a man to know ? Goddam it ! " " I did n't go to r'ile you . " " You do n't have to be askin ' all the time . Askin ' this and askin ' that till you git a man crazy . Goddam it ! " " I said I 'm sorry , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " God hisself would n't know Heavy Otter , chewed up and black and swole the way them Injuns are . " Poordevil said , " Heap beaver now . Injun all gone . " Boone mounted his horse and led the way around the lodges , hearing the magpies come crying in after they had passed . He kept nudging at Poky , wanting to get along . A man moving , giving to the twist and the rise and fall of his saddle , could ease himself away from his mind . He rode straight and stiff , feeling Jim 's eyes on him , and answering goddam it with the set of his back . When they came to a little flat Jim rode up alongside . The littlesmile on his mouth put Boone in mind of Summers . " I reckon Iknow how you feel , Boone , " Jim said . " I did n't aim to fly off at you . " After a silence Boone answered , " They ca n't all be dead , Jim . Not the whole nation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a long look . " I 'm hopin ' you 're right , " he answered , and let his horse fall behind as they entered timber again . P235The Missouri valley wound north before them , opening and tightening some and opening again , the valley that was as empty as if not a man ever had lived there . Once they saw a single lodge , half blown down , and bones lying around , picked almost clean of meat , and skin clothes scattered and torn by the teeth of wolves , and once they came on a couple of campfires , cold but not more than a day or two old . A child 's body was hoisted in a tree close by , but not wrapped careful . Already the birds had pecked away into the flesh . One day and another of travel , and the valley still empty and the Blackfeet gone from the face of the earth . At night now they camped careless , building big fires and eating elk or deer meat , or one of the buffalo that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silently , except for Poordevil , who grinned and talked as before , carefree as a young one who did n't know what made his elders solemn . Jim spoke little jokes now and then , trying to get shut of the cloud that hung over them but making a poor out of it . The sun rose bright in the morning and shone white and glaring in the day and left the western sky ablaze at night . Later the sky cooled to a red like an old wound , and still later the stars popped out , seeming low and plain as candles in the dark . It was prime weather for fall hunting , prime weather and prime country , but even Jim had quit laying his traps . A quiet hung over things , except for the cawing of crows and the chatter of magpies and the wind 's whining in the trees , whipping the yellowed leaves away . At night the call of wolves beat back and forth in the valley , and the whistle of bull elks hot for cows , leaving the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind riffling the short grass and worryingthe trees on the eastward slope and flowing on out of sight , fartherthan a man could know , to places a man never had heard tell of . The grass was curled and dry , headed out in darker brown . The feet of the horses raised puffs of dust from it that fell back if the wind was quiet , or streaked away . Riding all day in the wind , a man felt the grit in him , in his clothes and down his neck and against his skin , and grating between his teeth . He rode hunched against the wind , one shoulder up shielding his chin , and his mouth tightsetand dry , tasting the dirt . Slanting out from the west bank of the river , they came from the valley into a basin and threaded through a growth of trees , and it was then they saw their first live man . He sat a horse a quarter ofP236a mile away , and when his eye caught them he wheeled about and cut his pony with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slid from Poky , handed his rifle to Jim , and with the lariat took a quick hitch over the red horse 's nose . " Foller along . " He leaped astride the red horse , took back his rifle , and kicked the red belly . He felt the horse leap into movement under him and steady into an easy , long-striding run . He saw the proud head lifted and the small ears pointed ahead and the ground streaming under them . There was n't a horse he ever knew could match that pace . The rider before him grew bigger and plainer in the eye . The rider 's arm rose and fell with the quirt , and the horse answered to it with all he had . He was a buckety runner , though , galloping stiff and short . With the red horse after him it was as if he was standing still . A musket shot short of the timber , the man saw he could n't make it . He pulled up and got off and stood quiet , his arms hanging at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulder . Boone slowed the red horse to a walk and after a while dismounted and led him , going slow toward the Indian . The Indian did n't move . Not even a muscle in his face moved . He did n't act like a Blackfoot . It came to Boone , studying him , that there was nothing in the face to see , except that he was reminded of a beaten dog . It was as if hope was gone and all good feeling and all proud spirit . Here was a man would n't fight against anything , not even death , but would only run like a rabbit and hunch down and wait , humble and sad before it . While Boone watched , the Indian got down on his hands and knees and bowed his head . His hair fell in a tangle at the sides of his neck . " Git up , for Christ sake ! I ai n't aimin ' to kill you . " Boone squatted down and took his pipe from the ornamented case that hung around his neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howgh , " he said in his throat , and puffed and pointed the stem toward the Indian . He hunted for the Blackfoot words . " The white hunter 's heart is good . " The Indian 's sad face lifted . " The Long Knife looks for Heavy Otter  --  for his brother , Heavy Otter , the Piegan . " The wind played with the worn fringes of the man 's buckskins and left him and whirled in the grass , sending up a spiral of dust . P237Boone put a twist of tobacco on the prairie , to show it was a gift . The Indian 's eyes fixed on the tobacco , and a little gleam of hunger showed in them . " The Long Knife looks for Heavy Otter  --  for his brother , Heavy Otter . " Only the Indian 's eyes seemed alive , fixed on the twist . Boone turned around and beckoned for Poordevil and Jim to come on . They trotted up , bringing the pack string . " Tell him the Long Knife looks for Heavy Otter , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Otter is . " Poordevil slid from his horse , took a hungry suck at Boone 's pipe , and then put the question . " He do n't care to talk , " Jim said , grinning from his horse . " Ask him has the cat got his tongue , Poordevil . " " Shut up , Jim ! Is he a Piegan , Poordevil , or what ? " " Piegan , him . " " Ai n't nothin ' like whisky to ile a rusty tongue , " Jim said . " Sometimes you talk sense , Jim . Damn if you do n't . " Boone went to a pack horse and loosened a rope and from the pack took the bottle he had saved . He came back and took the cork out and set the bottle alongside the twist . " Good whisky . Good medicine water . " The Indian reached out suddenly , like a man snatching at a varmint , and caught the bottle and held it up . Some of the whisky spilled out over his chin . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jim said , still sitting his horse . The Indian brought the bottle down and spit and belched and wiped his mouth . " Ask him whereabouts is Heavy Otter , Poordevil . " Poordevil only grunted . " Take a drink yourself then , goddam you ! " Poordevil 's mouth spread happily , then closed over the mouth of the bottle . Boone took the whisky from Poordevil 's hand and set it close by his side . " No more until we make talk . By and by , whisky . Tell him that , Poordevil . " The Piegan 's face was turned on the bottle . It was still a sad and humble face , but with a hankering in it now that saved it from being dead . With whisky a man could getP238nearly anything he wanted from the Indians  --  from all of them , anyhow , except the Comanches , who did n't care for drink . " Ask him where at are the Piegans . Ask him about Heavy Otter . " The Indian listened while Poordevil spoke . As an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palms together . " Rubbed out ? " Boone asked sharply . The Indian spoke , spoke hoarse and deep in his chest . Boone shook his head . It was only the Blackfeet words he had practiced that he knew . " What 's he sayin ' , Poordevil ? I do n't git it all . " Poordevil talked part by sign and part by tongue . " Big sickness come . Long Knife bring sickness in fire canoe . " " How 's that ? " " Boat that walks on water bring sickness to big house . " " To Fort Union ? " Poordevil and the Indian talked again before Poordevil went on . " Long Knife bring sickness up river from big house . Big medicine . Big sickness . White man medicine too strong . Sickness come . Blackfoot run . Sickness run more . Blackfoot cry , know Great Spirit mad . Sickness rub out Blackfoot . All gone . " " Christ sake ! He do n't know they 're all dead , " Boone said to Jim , who sat slouched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead hisself , is he ? " To Poordevil he said , " Ask him where Heavy Otter 's band ran to . Ask him was there a young squaw ran . A daughter of Heavy Otter . More whisky , by and by . " " Heavy Otter sick , " Poordevil translated . " Him run . " " Run where ? " They talked again , and then Poordevil shrugged . His hands took hold of his breasts . " May be . " Boone asked , " Titty River ? Breast ? Teton ? " " Titty , " said Poordevil . " Same as Tansy , " Jim put in . " You recollect Summers told us ? " " Heavy Otter dead now sure . Goddam dead . " " He ai n't seen him dead , has he ? He thinks he is , is all . " The Piegan held out his hand , wanting the pipe , not snatching for it or making high and mighty talk , but asking for it humble . With it in his hand he squatted back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke deep into his lungs the way the Indians did . A man could n't tell he had had even a little drink , his face wasP239so set and quiet . A slow glow was in his eyes , though , under the rat 's nest of hair . " Ask him to write the way to the Titty , Poordevil . " Boone picked up a stick and made a mark in the dirt , to show he wanted a map made . When Poordevil had spoken the Indian took the stick and sighted around him and at the sun as if to get his directions . Then he drew a long line that bent off to Boone 's right , talking to Poordevilwhile he did it . " River , " said Poordevil . " Missouri , him . " He put his finger at one end of the line and brought it to the other , to show which way the stream flowed . " Curves off northeast , " Jim said . He had got off his horse and come to stand over the map . North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the first from the west . " Dearborn , " said Poordevil . Boone nodded . Summers had mentioned the Dearborn , too . Poordevil said , " Medicine , " pointing to another line farther to the north . " That 's the same as the Sun River , Boone . ' Member ? " Poordevil was smiling a silly smile . That Indian could get himselfdrunk quicker than scat . " Poordevil know , " he said putting his finger on the line . " Me know . " He looked at a new mark the Piegan was making still farther north . He punched his finger on it . " Titty . Betcha . " " How far ? " Poordevil turned to the Piegan . When he looked at Boone again he held up two fingers , then added a third . " Two-three camps ? " The Piegan tossed the stick aside . His gaze went to the bottle . Boone handed it over . Poordevil watched him drink and took the bottle from him and raised it to his mouth . When he put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ask him where the squaw is , Poordevil . Ask him about the daughter of Heavy Otter . " The Piegan handed the pipe to Boone and sat back with his arms folded and his head seeming to think . Boone had the feeling that the sadness had come over him again , as if the whisky hadP240pushed it away for a while and then brought it on all the stronger . Poordevil talked to him , and the Piegan listened and then talked back , using just a few words and rounding them out with his hands . Boone could hear beyond his voice to the sounds the horses made cropping at the grass . Only old Poky stood quiet , wanting to rest instead of eat . " Maybe dead , " Poordevil said . " Heap die . " He gestured toward the Piegan . " Do n't know , him . No want talk now , him . Talk all gone . " Boone took a long look at the Piegan , then got out another twist of tobacco and put it on the prairie . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let 's git on . " Riding away , he saw the Indian hunch forward and take the two twists of tobacco , his face still sad and dull , like the face of a critter that had lost its young . T hey struck north out of the basin and camped in a chain of low mountains that night and went on , coming out of a canyon into foothills on which the pines grew dwarfed and crooked . The Missouri had swung off eastward , starting the bend , Boone reckoned , that the Piegan had traced in the dirt . " This here must be the Dearborn , " he said while they stopped and let the horses drink at a stream . The mountains crowded high and close to the left but farther on , beyond the Dearborn valley , they veered to the west , standing blue and jagged against the sky . High along the slopes of the peaks the snow lay patched . Between the mountains and the Missouri was high , bare country , where a man on a rise saw buttes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far that he lost himself looking into it . It was a dusty country where even the sage grew spare and short and wood was so wanting that they made their fires of buffalo chips . For all its dusty bareness there were a sight of buffalo on it , and antelope and wolves and foxes small and delicate as kittens . The big jackass rabbits started up from it , jumping short and then settling to a long , flying stride . P241When the sun was high enough to loosen them up , rattlesnakes buzzed from low bushes or breaks in the sandstone , and big , stonegraygrasshoppers rose clacking , and a man could n't always tell whether it was a snake or a hopper that he heard . The prairie squirrels that Summers had called gophers stood straight as picket pins , piping shrill , and dived into their holes as the horses neared . They were big and fat now , ready for the winter sleep . Overhead there was more sky than a man could think , curving deep and far and empty , except maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watercourses that had cut into the dirt ran dry or stood still in little stinking pools that snipe and duck rose from . A little willow grew along them and sometimes a thirsty cottonwood . And nowhere was there an Indian or a lodge . The buffalo grazed peaceful , and the antelopes frisked as if they never knew a hunter . Going along one day on another , a man would think the world about had never seen the like of him . The gophers and the sky and the rattlesnakes and the brown plains rolling put Boone in mind of the Missouri above Fort Union . It was a long time ago that he had seen it , a long time ago for a wishing to stay with a body and to drive him on . Maybe Jim was right , half-hinting he was crazy . The plains slid down to a stream , shady with cottonwood from which the leaves were whirling . Poordevil , feeling big for what he knew , said it was the south fork of the Medicine . A wide , bare hump divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast over clean stones , hardly giving the trees time to catch hold along its banks . They camped by it and feasted on fat buffalo and went on in the morning , climbing to the benchlands again . To their left the benches sloped off into a basin of red and yellow badlands , bare even of grass , that twisted and humped and finally climbed to foothills . To the north and east the land was better , growing a fuzz of grass that the buffalo fattened on . It was parched , though , and tan with the sun . A herd of buffalo making a little run raised a cloud of dust like smoke . Even the running rabbit left puffs of it behind him . It was toward evening that they came to the end of the benches and , standing close by the shoulder of a butte , looked down on a wide , green valley . Poordevil grunted and filled his lungs and made a sweepingP242motion over the land with his arm and spoke out of pride in knowing . His two hands came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the Titty , Boone , I reckon , " Jim said while his gaze took it in . " Seems like it 's a whole world away from the Green . Seems like we been travelin ' all our lives . Seems like we 're certain sure to be in British country . " The eye could follow the river winding and see where canyons notched the blue mountains . One peak looked like an ear turned on its side . Trees and river and the wide valley and the brown hills on either side floated in the fall haze , lazy and comfortable and sleepy now with autumn . It was as pretty a place as a man could wish , a prime place except that the world seemed dying and a man 's hankering was cold and foolish in him . " Which way ? " Jim asked . " We 'll aim upstream and come down if they ai n't there . " Boone kicked his horse . The benches dropped and leveled off into the valley , where prairie hens rose drumming from under the horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among the silver leaves buffalo berries sparkled red as beads . They let the horses drink at a small stream and went on to the Teton and followed it west and north toward a notch in the mountains , toward the ear that lay on its side . " Purty water , " Jim said where they crossed at a game trail . " Small , but purty as I ever see . " He checked his horse . Boone dropped off Poky and bellied down and drank , feeling the water flowing cool and sweet on his lips , seeing down in it as clear as air . Out from him , in the blue water of a hole , a fish floated . He could see the gills working , could have counted every spot if he set himself to it . On the far bank a cottontail rabbit sat as still as stone except for the tiny spread and close of its nose . A pretty little river . Pretty country . And the world empty and seeming to be dying to men . Maybe that was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die and the country go back to what it was before , with only the dumb brutes grazing and the birds flying under all the sky . The sun floated behind the ragged rim of mountains , and a stillness came on . A man speaking heard his voice like something that did n't belong there . It came out into the quiet , soundingP243hoarse and strange , and the quiet cracked to it as ice would crack to a step . " Nigh time to camp , " Jim said as they rode on , and at the same time Poordevil straightened and pointed . Ahead of them , through a screen of cottonwoods , a feather of smoke was rising . They rode toward it and came out of the trees and , maybe a stone 's throw away , saw three lodges standing and two men by them and two children and a squaw , faced about to watch them but with nothing in their faces except the slow look that a tame cow might give , seeing a man passing . " Piegans , " Poordevil announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go ahead , Poordevil . Ask ' em where at is Heavy Otter . " Jim 's face turned toward Boone with a quick , queer look in it . Boone did n't explain . There was n't any use explaining , no use telling why he hung back now , with the feeling of bad luck in him . Sometimes a man could push ahead , strong and cheerful , and then something would come into him and make his heart low and hold him where he was . It did n't stand to reason that Teal Eye was alive when so many had died . He saw Poordevil dismount and walk ahead , and then he lighted his pipe and looked at the ground , waiting . When Poordevil got back he said , " Heavy Otter dead . Big sickness . " " The squaw ? " " Red Horn chief , " said Poordevil , motioning up river with his arm . " Talk Red Horn , you . " Jim 's gaze was on Boone . He said , " That Injun finds out everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We got time to go on a piece afore dark . " " Why' n't the Piegans camped together , you reckon ? Afeard of the sickness , likely . " Half a mile farther they came on to two lodges . A man came out of one of them as they approached and stood still as a post after he spied them , with no musket in his hand and no bow . Boone signaled for a halt and got off Poky and laid his rifle in the grass and his pistols by it . " Poordevil do n't learn enough , damn him ! I 'll go my own self and call for him if need be , " heP244said to Jim . With no weapon but the knife in his belt he walked toward the lodge , holding his hands together in the sign of peace . Then he closed his left hand and patted it with his right , as if loadinga pipe . When he had covered half the distance , he halted , waiting on the Indian , but the Indian did n't move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age in his face and of the sadness Boone had seen before , and of something else , too , of high pride or anger held in . The hair on his head had been hacked short , to show he had had a grief . By the thin , curving nose and wide , hard mouth a man could see there was mettle in him . Boone sounded the words he had learned from Poordevil , speaking loud so that they would carry . " The white hunter 's heart is good . " If the Indian understood he gave no sign . " The white hunter would make talk . " Still the Indian stood silent and unmoving , his mouth straight and strong under his beak of nose . " Red Horn , you ? " A bare flicker of the eyes told Boone he had guessed right . He called over his shoulder . " Send Poordevil up , Jim . Get him to leave his rifle and bring that there Crow scalp . " He turned back . " The white hunter is a friend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a Crow scalp . " He took the scalp from Poordevil and held it up . " Tell him the white men come in peace , Poordevil . Tell him the Long Knife looks for a young squaw , the daughter of Heavy Otter . " Poordevil said the Blackfoot words , but still the other Indian held his tongue , seeming to study whether to answer or not . When he spoke it was in a low voice for an Indian . " White man bring whisky , " Poordevil translated . " Make Injun crazy . White man sleep with squaw . Make sick here . " His hand went to his crotch . " White man heart bad . " " Tell him that 's Bad Medicines . Tell him it 's the French and not the Long Knives . " Before Poordevil could speak , the Indian was talking again . Poordevil bent his head , figuring the English of it . " Pieganfight . Piegan fight heap . Keep white man away . White man bringP245big medicine , big sickness . Kill Piegan . Piegan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . Piegan no fight now . " Boone let his glance travel around . From the other lodge , to the right of the Indian , two faces peered , a squaw 's and a child 's , solemn as owls . Just the heads showed , as if they had been pinned to the side of the opening . " Ask him about the squaw . " Through the opened flap behind the Indian Boone 's eye caught movement . It was a blur inside the darkened tepee , and then a face , a young squaw 's face , and two eyes big and soft as any doe 's . He made himself hold still , made his gaze go to the grass , made his hands get out his pipe , made his face stiff and straight . His mind spun and settled and began to work at the way of it while each grass stem stood sharp and separate to his eye . After a whilehe had the answer . A man could travel many a camp , with a hun-S ger in him and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveled for nothing , and so his hope went dead while the hunger kept on gnaw- SC " ingg him . He could have a feeling in him that seemed right and natural and bound to turn out , and it could be a fool feeling all along , like it had been with him . A man and a squaw in a lodge meant one thing , just one thing . He heard his voice saying , " It do n't matter , Poordevil . Tell him we leave presents for him and his woman . " His legs lifted him and turned him part way round , while his ears only half brought the Indians ' palaver to him . He heard Jim yell , " How , Teal Eye ! How ! " He heard Jim 's horse walking up . Poordevil plucked him on the arm . " Red Horn , him . " " It do n't matter . " " Chief . " " We leave presents . " Jim sat his horse , his mouth open in a big grin and his blue eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Best get out some tobacco and beads and such , " Boone said to Jim . " No got squaw , " said Poordevil . " Squaw die . Two squaw die . Whole goddam squaw die . No got squaw . "   " What you mean ? " Poordevil pointed . " Squaw b'long Heavy Otter . Red Horn b'long Heavy Otter . " Boone said to Jim , " This goddam Injun do n't know what he 's sayin ' , no more'n a crazy man . " Jim 's face had gone serious . He sat thoughtful , with the bristles showing red on his chin and his eyes puckered . " I do ' know , Boone . " Of a sudden he looked up , past Boone 's half-turned shoulder . " Tour man , him ? " he asked . " Tour brother , him ? " " Brother ! " Poordevil let out the word as if he had been hunting for it . " Red Horn brother . " Jim 's voice sounded again . " Hey , Teal Eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Boone did n't look . If Teal Eye answered he did n't hear . What he heard next was Jim saying to him , " Go on , Boone ! Go on ! Time to ask . " He held in , so 's nothing would show in his face . He saw his feet moving under him again , saw his fingers working at the pack , saw the rich painter skin , the vermilion , the tobacco . He saw in his mind , without letting himself meet it , Jim 's eye sharp and curious on him . He led up the red horse . He noticed the interest rising in Red Horn 's eyes as he watched , but what he noticed mostly , withoutfixing straight on it , was Teal Eye , with recognition in her look and what a man might take for warmth . " Tell him the red horse is a present , Poordevil , it and the painterskin and the rest . " His tongue stumbled over the practiced words . " The white hunter wants the daughter of Heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went stiff and blank again , as if he had put the horse away from him and closed his head to what was said . Boone 's gaze went down before that stony look and came back up and searched beyond and found the big eyes searching , too , and a softnesson the mouth that might be meant for him . If only he could talk with Teal Eye , away from Red Horn and the rest ! P247Of a man wanted a woman for his squaw he went to her father and asked how much the father loved her and what gifts would make his heart glad to have a son in the family . The father talked to the woman afterward and to her mother and then told the man what he wanted . If it was n't too much , the man brought his gifts and took his squaw , and that was the way of it . That was the way of it , except that if the woman 's father was n't alive , the man went to her oldest brother , and if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kin . That was the way of it , except sometimes things did n't allow for such doings and a man did the best he could , as Boone had done with Red Horn and Teal Eye . Boone sat by himself on a gravel bank , watching the Teton flow by . It had been a full day since he had offered the red horse and the painter skin and all , and still he did n't know . Maybe Red Horn would n't deal with a white man , there was so much bitterness in him . Maybe he would say no while his eyes stayed hungry on the horse . Maybe Teal Eye had her head set another way , on some young Piegan who had just proved himself a brave warrior . Maybe she argued with Red Horn , telling him not to take the horse and the skin and the vermilion and the powder and ball . Boone had caught just one peek at her since the day before . The water ran easy at his feet , talking to itself as it went . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a brown clearness in it that came from fall and leaves the trees had dropped . Up to his right , where the Teton had cut into a bank and made a hole , a lazy trout lipped at the surface , sending out little spreading circles . A chokecherry bush hung over the hole , its green gone but with some berries hanging black and wrinkled on it . The mountains lifted blue in the west , cutting sharp into the quiet sky . High and far in them lay patches of snow . He could see the mountain like an ear and the notch by its side that the Teton ran out of , and southwardhe could see the canyon of the Medicine with a high reef of rock on one side and a sawtoothed mountain on the other . Betweenthe two rivers were smaller canyons made by streams that maybe the white man had n't put a name to yet . None of them could be as pretty as the Teton winding , busy but not hurried , with aP248mind and time to have a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew on its banks , and chokecherry and serviceberry bushes and wild rose and red willow that the Indians mixed with tobacco . No place could be prettier than this valley , with two buttes rising to the south and the tan hills ridged wide on the sides , and cottonwood and black birch and sagebrush growing , and elk and deer about and buffalo coming down from the benches to drink . It was a place a man could spend his whole life in and never wish for better . Looking beyond the stream and over the first hills to others that rose round and pointed , Boone could guess how the Teton got its name . Some lonesome Frenchman , likely , had looked and been reminded of a woman . Some Bad Medicine , froze for squaws , had seen the hills , and it was like seeing a woman lying with her breasts arched and sharp at the nipples , and his hunger had nagged him and he had said tetons , tetons as if just the saying eased him . Boone heard the water talking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cawing somewhere , and after a while he heard a footfall close by and leather moving and the sounds of sitting down and the sounds of breathing . He did n't start or turn or lay hold on his rifle . He had a feeling who it was . Things were turningout as he had had a secret hope they would . Things were turning out as he had wished when he walked by Red Horn 's lodge and came down the game trail through the brush to the river 's edge . He picked up a bright pebble and let his eye run over it and flipped it into the stream with his thumb . He saw it hit and shimmer down and lie white and liquid as the water flowed over it . He felt her eyes on him . He saw them without looking , the meltingeyes and the face young and clean-lined and the breasts swelling under the leather and the feet narrow in their moccasins . With another woman he would have made the sign of lying down and teased her with a hand of beads or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up and gone on and forgotten her , as he had forgotten a heap of squaws in his time . With another woman he would have acted like a natural man . His eyes would have been bold and his tongue limber and his hands forward . What was it made him hold back ? What was it made him sit wondering , like aP249boy who had n't had a taste of women ? His eye slid to the side and saw her face quiet and her gaze fixed deep on the running water , and too much thought in her ever to lay tongue to . Could it be she had been waiting for him all this time , saying no to others ? Could it be , being as Red Horn had told Poordevil she never had taken herself a man ? He sat silent , feeling unsure and silly , and still it was like talking to her , like letting out how the idea of her had built up in him until he had seen her face in the sky and heard her voice in the breeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prairie hen put him in mind of her laugh and the bright pebbles that the stream flowed over set him thinking of her teeth and he never saw a wild goose headed north that she was n't in his head . He wanted her to come to his lodge and be his woman and make his moccasins for him . He would raise meat aplenty ; their lodge would have a galore of meat , and scalps hanging by it that he would lift from the enemiesof her people . Her breath said , " Boone . Boone , " as if practicing the word , and then he turned to face her and his eyes met hers and looked into them , trying to see what lay beyond . " You fain ' to come to my lodge , Teal Eye ? You aim to be my squaw ? Reckon I want you bad . " He pointed at her and at himself and brought the tips of his forefingerstogether in the sign for tepee . All the time it was like his eyes speaking to her and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with words or all understood by the mind , saying things that went back many a season to the first days on the Mandan and Jourdonnais talking of the little squaw with an eye like the bluewing teal . A quick , small smile came on her face . Behind them the bushes moved and , turning , Boone saw Poordevilstanding on the trail with his ugly face split into a smile and his tongue showing through the gap in his teeth . His head jerked up and down as if to tell Boone he was a smart picker . " Goddam you , Poordevil ! Git ! " Poordevil came closer . His finger motioned at Teal Eye . " Punkin , " he said . " Heap punkin . " Teal Eye got up . But before she dodged around Poordevil and ran up the path she crossed her wrists quickly and put them over her heart and brought one to bear on the other . Boone saw the softP250breast yield and swell out to the side . The little smile flashed , and she was gone . Boone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water and the western mountains cutting into the sky and the rounded hills that had reminded the lonely Frenchman of a woman . He heard the voice of the stream and the stirrings of the breeze and Poordevil taking a step behind him . Over the mountains the sky arched clear and deep so that a man looking let himself be lost in it like a bird floating . Crossing the wrists and hugging them over the heart was sign talk for love .   A man could sit and let time run on while he smoked or cut on a stick with nothing nagging him and the squaws goingabout their business and the young ones playing , makingout that they warred on the Assiniboines . He could let time run on , Boone thought while he sat and let it run , and feel his skin drink the sunshine in and watch the breeze skipping in the grass and see the moon like a bright horn in the sky by night . One day and another it was pretty much the same , and it was all good . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm and small and got bigger again as it dropped , and the slow clouds sailed red after it had gone from sight . There was meat to spare , and beaver still to trap if a man wanted to put himself out . In the summer the Piegans went to buffalo and later pitched camp close to Fort McKenzieand traded for whisky and tobacco and blankets and cloth and moved on to the Marias or the Teton or the Sun or the Three Forks for a little trapping and the long , lazy winter . If the beaver were few , buffalo still were plenty , for all that the Piegans slaughtered more and more of them just so 's to have hides to trade . Boone had seen regular herds of them chased over the steep bluffs that the Indians called pishkuns and lying at the bottomafterwards with broken necks or standing or lunging on three legs while the hunters rode among them with battleaxes and bows and arrows , and then the squaws , chattering and happy , following up with their knives and getting bloody and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then and all feeling good because they had something to set by for winter . P254Boone drew slow on his pipe while his eye took in the meat drying on the racks and the squaws working with the skins and the lodges pitched around . A dog came up and got a whiff of his tobaccoand made a nose and backed up and by and by went on . Off a little piece Heavy Runner lay in front of his lodge with his head in his squaw 's lap . The squaw was going through his hair with her fingers , looking for lice and cracking them between her teeth when she found any . In other lodges medicine men thumped on drums and shook buffalo-bladder rattles to drive the evil spirits out of the sick . They made a noise that a man got so used to that he hardly took notice of it . It was a good life , the Piegan 's life was . There were buffalo hunts and sometimes skirmishes with the Crows and Sioux , or the Nepercy who came from across the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any of their own ; the sun heated a man in the summer and the winter put a chill in his bones , so that he kept close by his fire and ate jerked meat and pemmican if need be and looked often to the western sky for the low bank of clouds that would mean a warm wind was coming . Life went along one day after another as it had for five seasons now , and the days went together and lost themselves in one another . Looking back , it was as if title ran into itself and flowed over , running forward from fast times and running back from now so that vesterday an o ay were the same . Or maybe time did n't flow at all but just stood still while a body moved around in it . A man hunted or fought , and sat smoking and talking at night , and after a while the camp went silent except for the dogs taking a notion to answer to the wolves , and so then he went in and lay with his woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be living like this , with his belly satisfied and himself free and his mind peaceful and in his lodge a woman to suit him . Boone did n't guess , though , that Jim ever would be shut of fret the way he was , maybe because Jim never had found a squaw that wore good with him . Jim was forever pulling up and going somewhere , to Union or Pierre or St. Louis . Boone had traveled a considerablehimself , but not to places where people were ; he went into the mountains or across to British country or north into Canadawhere the Gros Ventres lived when they were n't on the move . Hep255liked free country , with no more than some Indians about , and his squaw . When Jim came back from a trip he was full of talk about new forts along the river and new people moving out from the settlementsand the farmers in Missouri palavering about Oregon and California , as if the mountains were a prime place for plows and pigs and corn . When Jim went on too long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be bothered with fool talk that stirred a man up inside . Jim always seemed glad to be back , even if he was always settingout again . His face would light up when he saw Boone , and his hand was warm and strong and his mouth smiling . When he looked at Teal Eye it was as if he wished her double was around somewhere . Boone would catch just a gleam in his blue eye sometimes , or a kind of long , slow look that would make a man flare up if he did n't know Teal Eye so well , that maybe would put blood in his eye if Jim was n't his friend . Teal Eye was the woman for Boone . He reckoned he never wound take a second woman in his lodge , and never have to cut Teal Eye 's nose off , either , the way a Piegan did when he found his woman had lain in secret with another man . It was a sight , the squaws you saw with no end to their noses . Cut-nose women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaves , not having a man any longer or any proper home . Teal Eye suited him all right . There was n't any sense in a man nosing around like a bull , or wanting to cover every new woman just from being curious . One woman was enough , if she was the right one . Teal Eye never whined or scolded or tried to make a man something else than what he was by nature , but just took him and did her work and was happy . She had got a little heavier lately but was still well-turned in her body , with sharp , full breasts and a flat stomach and legs slim and quick as a deer 's . Most squaws aged early , looking pretty just when the first bloom was on them and then drying up or going all to flesh , but not Teal Eye , maybe becauseshe never had caught herself a baby . Looking at her , Boone could n't tell much difference from five seasons back when he had found her on the Teton with Red Horn . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mandan time , except that she was a womanP256now and rounded out as a woman ought to be . Her face was still slim and delicate , and her eyes melting and her spirit quick and cheerful and her body graceful . What she cared about most was to please him . She watched while he ate the meat or tried a new pair of moccasins and showed pleasure in her face when he grunted an all right . And she was always ready for him when his body was hungry , not lying still and spraddled , either , like a shot doe , but joining in , unashamed , her legs smooth and warm and strong and her breath whispering in his ear . Boone uncrossed one leg and stretched it out before him and studied the moccasin he wore . Teal Eye had put a decoration of colored porcupine quills on it , arranging them neat and in a nice pattern . She had tanned the leather for this foot white and for the right foot yellow , so that a person not knowing Piegan ways would think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he thought , while his mind went to wishing that Jim would come back soon from St. Louis . He felt better with Jim around . There was more spirit in him , and he laughed oftener . There was n't anyone could find fun like Jim , or set a man 's head to working so . When he thought of it , it was as if Jim was a part of all the life he liked , as if he always had been ever since they had met up on the road between Frankfort and Louisville , and Jim uneasy with the dead body in his wagon . Take Jim away and Boone felt there was something wanting , though he still would n't trade his way of living for any he ever knew or heard tell of . When Jim came back , it was as if all was well again . A man went with the feeling inside him that everything was right and just about as he would order it if it was his to order . Jim ought to be back soon , Boone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of furs . It could be he had made up his mind to stay the winter in the settlements and to come back in the spring when the flood water would float steamboats to Fort Union and farther . Boone reckoned not , though . Jim never stayed away for a long stretch . Likely he would come overland , maybe with a party of mountain men who had spent their beaver . For all his traipsing around , Jim was a true mountain man , with the life showing in his face and in the set of his shoulders and legs and the way of his walk . The wind was moving out of the west , as it nearly always did , sometimes hard and sometimes easy but nearly always moving . A shadow fell on the land , and lightning flickered and thunder sound-P257ed , and a big splash of rain fell on the hand Boone held his pipe with . The Piegans spent a heap of time inside their lodges . He liked to sit outside where the sun could hit him and the breeze get at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menfolk back in Kentucky , sitting around the door while the day turned by , only he did n't have a hickory chair and would n't sit in it if he had . A man got so he did n't feel right unless seated cross-legged . The rain would n't be but a drop or two . Already the cloud was sailing over him , passing on east . Boone knocked out his pipe and sat still , letting time run by . Each part if time was good in itself , if a man knew to enjoy it and didn'tp ss1arit to Hass so as to ge a eas to somet ing ifferent. - Bymvl y by Red Horn came along and sat down by him , not speaking until he got his pipe going . Red Horn 's eyes seemed to get sharper with the years , and his nose higher and more hooked . The wrinkles were like cuts at the side of his mouth though he was n't old yet . He made Boone think of an eagle , except he did n't bite or claw any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joint of one finger . He had cut it off , along with his hair , when old Heavy Otter died of the smallpox . " We have meat enough , and hides , " said Red Horn , speaking the Blackfoot tongue that Boone knew almost as well as white men 's talk . " More hides than meat . " Red Horn puffed on his pipe . " The buffalo die fast , Red Horn . " " They are plenty . " " They die fast , with hunters killing them for hides alone . " Red Horn hunched his shoulders . " They are more now than before the big sickness . We need robes to trade . " " I hope we never want for meat . " The lines in Red Horn 's face deepened . He spread his hands , as if there was no use in anything . " The buffalo will last while the Indianlasts . Then we do not care . The buffalo can not die faster than the Indian . " " We do well enough . " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Piegans when their lodges were many and their warriors strong . We are a few now , and we are weak and tired , and our men drink the strongP258water and will not go far from the white man 's trading house . They quarrel with one another . The white man 's sickness kills them . We are like Sheepeaters . We are poor and sick and afraid . " " The nation will grow strong . The white man will leave us . We shall be many and have buffalo and beaver and live as the old ones lived . " Red Horn grunted and took the pipe from his lips to speak . " Strong Arm is a paleface . He will go back to his brothers when the Piegans go to the spirit land . " " No ! " Boone answered in English . " Damn if ever I go back  --  not for good , anyways ! " He switched to Blackfoot . " Strong Arm is a Piegan though his face is white . " " Already , " said Red Horn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " " They have no right . It is Piegan land . " " We are weak . We can not fight the Long Knives . Red Horn will not fight . He tells his people to keep the arrow from the bow and their hands from the medicine iron . " It was no use arguing with Red Horn . The spirit was dead in him , except for a sadness and an old anger that fanned up sometimeslike a coal touched by wind . He could n't see ahead . Already the white hunter was getting scarce in the mountains , finding beavertoo few and too cheap and the life too risky now that the big parties were gone and he had to travel small . It would be the same with the other white men , with the traders who crowded the river and with those who figured to settle and make crops where crops would n't grow . Things came and went and came again . " Red Hair should be back soon , " Boone said , watching Teal Eye come toward the lodge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the edge of her eye looked at him and her face told him he was her man . He heard her freshening the fire . The days were getting shorter . Already the sun was dipping behind the mountainrim , well to the south of its summer setting place . The breeze began to quiet , as if it could n't blow without the sun shining on it . " Red Hair waits at the trading house ? " Red Horn asked . " Maybe Jim is there . " " Two suns , and we go to trade . " " Good . " Red Horn got up and looked around the village , the lines cut-P259ting into his face , as if he could see how far the Piegan lodges would stand if the big sickness had n't come along . Boone smoked another pipe after Red Horn had gone . From inside there came the little noises that told him Teal Eye was readying the pot for him . The smell of wood smoke was in the air and of good meat cooking . A man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . High in the sky Boone could hear the whimper of nighthawks . Looking close , he spied one of them , divingcrazy and crooked and whimpering as it dived . He knocked the ash from his pipe and got up , stretching , and ducked under his medicine bundle that hung over the entrance and went in  --  to his lodge , to his meat , to his woman. he first snow had fallen before Jim came back . It was awet and heavy snow that weighted the branches down anddropped from them onto a man 's shoulders and down his neck as he poked through the brush along the Musselshell looking for beaver-setting . The first flight of ducks from the north came with it , their wings whistling in the gray dusk . The water in the beaver ponds stood dark and still against the whitened banks . Deep down , the trout lay slow as suckers . In a day the snow slushed off . The sun came again and the wind swung back to the west and the ground dried , but the country was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no life in it , lying ready for winter , lying poor and quiet while the wind tore at it one day after another . A trapper making his lift heard the wind in the brush and the last stubborn leaves ticking dead against the limbs ; he looked up and saw the sky deep and cold and a torn cloud in it , and when he sniffed he got the smell of winter in his nose  --  the sharp and lonesome smell of winter , of cured grass and fallen leaves and blown grit and cold a-coming on . His legs cramped in the water and his fingers stiffened with his traps , and he felt good inside that his meat was made and berries gathered against the time ahead . Now was a time to hunt , and to think forward to lodge fires and long , fat days and a full stomach and talk like Jim knew how to make . P260One beaver from six settings . A poor lift , but a man could n't expect better , not while he traveled with a parcel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn paths along . A plew would n't buy much from Chardon , the new bourgeois at McKenzie . A man could put one beaver of whisky in his eye and never wink , and a beaver of red cotton for Teal Eye would n't much more than flag an antelope . It was good a man needed but a little of boughten things . The buffalo gave him meat and clothing and a bed and a roof over his head , and what the buffalo did n't give him the deer or sheep did , except for tobacco and powder and lead and whisky , and cloth and fixings for his squaw . Boone picked up the beaver by a leg and went to his horse and mounted and rode back toward camp . Teal Eye would skin out the beaver and cook the tail . Her hands worked fast and sure for all they were so small . And she hardly needed to look what they were doing . She could watch him or laugh or talk , and they never missed a lick and never lagged . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter if they had half a dozen wives , and it did n't crawl with lice , either , like some did . Maybe that was because of the winter she had spent in St. Louis with the whites ; more likely it was just because she was Teal Eye and neat by natureand knew how to keep a lodge right and how to fix herself pretty , using red beads in her black hair , where they looked good , and blue or white beads against her brown skin , where they looked good , too . Near his tepee Boone saw two horses standing gaunt and hipshotand heard voices coming from inside . He checked his own horse and listened and knew that Jim had come home . Teal Eye 's laugh floated out to him . He jumped off and dropped the beaver by the door and stooped and went in . Jim yelled , " How ! How , Boone ! " He scrambled to his feet , holding a joint of meat in one hand . He spoke through a mouthful of it . " Gim me your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be back . " Boone looked at the red hair and the face wrinkling into a smile and the white teeth showing and felt Jim 's hand hard and strong in his own . " Goddam you , Jim , " he said . " What kep ' you ? Ought to hobble you or put you on a rope . And damn if you did n't get your hair cut ! Like an egg with a fuzz on it , your head looks . " P261Jim ran a hand through the short crop on his skull . " Done it to keep people from askin ' questions back in the States . Wisht I could grow it back as quick as I cut it off . " In Blackfoot Teal Eye said , " We thought Red Hair had taken a white squaw . " " Not me , " said Jim . " Too fofaraw , them bourgeways are . I got things to do besides waitin ' on a woman . " He changed to Blackfoot talk . " The white men in their big villages do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lazy . They do not dress skins and cut wood and pitch and break camp . They are not like Teal Eye . " Boone could see Teal Eye was pleased . He sat down by the fire and put out his wet feet and lighted his pipe . Teal Eye came and took off his wet moccasins and brought dry ones . Jim sat down and lit up , too . It was good , this was , this having Jim here and winter edging close and a pot of meat fretting and the fire coming out and warminga man 's feet and tobacco smoke sweet in his mouth . It made Boone feel snug inside and satisfied . He wished it could be that the Piegan men would n't come visiting until he and Jim had had their own visit out . " You did n't beat winter but by a hair , Jim . " " I look for open weather for a while . " " Red Horn says no . Says it 'll be cold as all hell . " " Some thinks one way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for an easy winter . " " How 'd you travel  --  boat or horse or how ? " " Horse mostly . Steamboat to the Platte , and then traded two horses away from the Grand Pawnees and follered my nose to McKenzie . Chardon told me where you was . " " Any Indian doin 's ? " " Cheyennes was all . A hunting party . I got one fair through my sights after he taken a shot at me , and give the others the slip . They pounded around a right smart , tryin ' to get wind of me , but it were n't so much . Not like the old Blackfeet was . Not like them hornets . " " Cheyennes ? " " That was it , now . A man would n't expect it . " Sitting there in the dark of the lodge with the fire warming his feet and Jim 's voice coming to his ears and reminding him of old things , Boone thought back to times he and Summers and Jimp262had had with the Blackfeet . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them had , and come close to being killed more than once . There was no one fought like the old Blackfeet did , so fierce and unforgiving , until the smallpox came along and made good Indians of them . Put together all the Indians he and Summers and Jim had rubbed out , and it would make a fair village . " See Dick ? " he asked . " Married ! Damn if he ai n't ! And to a white woman ! He 's farmin ' . Corn and pigs and some tobacco . " " Pigs ? " " Pigs . " " I mind when he did n't like the notion of hog meat . " " Nor white women neither , for that part . " " How 's he ? " " Good enough , I reckon . He ' lows it 's better'n bein ' dead , but of course he do n't know about that . I always figgured that bein ' dead would save a man a sight of trouble . " " You never acted that way . Keen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On account of maybe a man 's got to go to hell yet . But if he do n't , I mean if when he 's dead he 's dead and no more to it , why , then , bein ' dead could be better than bein ' deviled . " Teal Eye had fed the fire and seen there was plenty of meat in the pot and had sat down to work on a shirt . Boone saw her eyes go from one to the other of them as they talked , and quick understandingshowing in them . She followed most things that a man might say in English , though she did n't use it much . " The Piegan knows that he goes to the spirit land , " she put in . " He does not fear dying like the white man does , because he knows . " Jim gave her a quick smile . " Some Indians think different . Some believe in the Great Medicine of the white man . " " The Flatheads , " she said , " and the Pierced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Heaven . They are not warriors like the Piegans . They are not a great people . " Jim took a wooden bowl and filled it from the pot with a horn spoon and got his knife out and began eating again . After a while he said , " I went clean to Kentucky , Boone . Seed the place I was brung up and all . " Boone grunted . " I left word to get to your kin , figurin ' you would n't mind . Someone said your pap was ailin ' . "   " Dead now and gone to hell I hope . " " It 's a poor way of doin ' back there , it is . " " Looks like you would n't always be a-goin ' , then . " " A man likes to get around . " Jim wiped his mouth with the back of his hand while a little frown came over his eyes as if he was studying what to say . " It 's a sight , Boone , how people are pointin ' west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A body would n't know the river any more , with the new forts on her and the Mandans all dead and the Rees gone . You would n't know her , Boone . " Boone grunted again . A grunt was a handy thing , saying much with little . " And steamboats ! Damn if ever you seed such boats , Boone , so many of ' em and so white and fancy . " " A heap get wrecked . " " That do n't stop the building of ' em . " " In time it will , I 'm thinkin ' . " " Folks everywhere talk about Oregon and California . They aim to make up parties . " " What for ? " " To get to new land , Boone . To get where there 's room to breathe , I reckon . To get away from the fever . Y'ever stop to think about the fever , Boone ? How many 's got ager and such ? Nigh half has the shakes . " " They 'll shake worse , time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sickness , " Teal Eye put in , looking up from her awl . It was as if her eye did n't see them but looked into other lodges and watched the children that had caught fevers and cramps in the belly lately and had died , some of them , while the medicine men had made a racket over them trying to scare the bad spirits out . It was as if , for a little while , her ear heard only the shake of a rattleand the pound of a drum . " It ai n't nothin ' , the Piegans ' sickness ai n't , " Jim answered , smiling into her still face . He got up . " I brung you a present , " he said as if he had just thought of it , and went to the old trap sack he had laid inside the lodge and brought out a looking glass with a wooden back and a wooden handle . Teal Eye made a little noise in her throat as she took it . P264Boone caught Teal Eye 's glance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beaver outside . " Jim had turned back to the trap sack . He brought a bottle of whisky out of it and handed it to Boone . " Just so 's you can wet your dry . " Teal Eye got up and went outside to skin the beaver . " Huntin ' ai n't much ? " Jim asked . " I catch a few . " Boone took a drink and offered the bottle to Jim . It was sure-enough whisky , not the alcohol and water that mostly passed for whisky . He felt Jim 's mind studying him , as if there was something had n't been brought to sight yet . " There 's better ways of making money . " " Could be ways of makin ' more , but not better ways . " " Easier , anyhow . " Boone drank again and passed the bottle and refired his pipe . " Teal Eye looks slick , " Jim said , as if he was just making talk while his mind worked . Before he could go on , the entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and after him Heavy Runner and Big Shield . They sat down , not speaking , and seeing it was a solemn visit , Boone passed around a bowl of dried meat and berries and got out his best pipe , which had the red head of a woodpeckerfastened to the long stem and a big fan of feathers above the head . He loaded it and set the bowl on a chunk of dirt and blew up to the sun and down to the earth and passed it to Red Horn on his left . Red Horn had dressed himself up for the meeting with Jim . He wore a scarlet uniform with blue facings on it that Chardon had given him and had a company medal hanging from his neck . There was red on his eyelids and red stripes on his cheeks and beads hanging from his ears , and he carried a swan 's wing in his hand . Beforehe smoked he spit to the north and south because that was his medicine . Boone started the half-empty bottle around then and sat back , waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his throat and patted his bare belly with his hand . He was one Indian would n't dress up for anything , but would wear his old leggings and dirty robe no matter what . He had let the robe drop around his hams , leaving the upper part of him naked and showing the two oldP265scars he had cut crosswise on each arm . Boone guessed his squaw had n't done such a good job on the lice ; he could see one climbing out on a hair . After a while old Heavy Runner felt it moving and lifted one scarred arm and picked it off and put it in his mouth . Big Shield let the whisky trickle slow into his mouth . His face , raised to the bottle , was red with vermilion mixed with grease . The light of the fire glistened on it and shone white on the new bighorn shirt he wore . The bottle had just a drop in it when it came back to Boone . It was a time before they got their palavering done and even then the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then while he took up his talk with Boone , though none of them , except for Red Horn , could follow a white man 's words . " A man runs on to some queer hosses , " Jim said . " I met up with one aims to learn every pass across the mountains . " " Ai n't so queer . We 1'ar n't a few ourselves . " " That was for beaver . " Boone used a grunt again . " This man ai n't no trapper . I ca n't figure what he is , exactly . Says he 's goin ' to be ready when people really start to move . Maybe he aims to set up trading posts along the way or hire out to take people from the settlements . I do n't guess he knows , himself , yet , but he 's certain sure there 'll be a galore of chances for a man as knows his way in the mountains . He 's an educated man , he is , educatedso high and fine a man ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fool talk all the same . " " If there 's a pass as 'll do , he looks for steamboats to bring a pile of settlers and traders and such to Union , from where they 'll head acrost to the Columbia . He 's got a flock of notions flyin ' around in his head . " Boone drew on his pipe and blew the smoke out in a thin jet while he looked at Jim . " When you startin ' ? " Jim 's eyelids flicked . " I did n't say nothin ' about startin ' . " " No need to . " " He 's been south and 's headin ' up this way . Lookin ' for a couple of mountain men to show him a north pass . Dollar and a half a day he 'll pay . " " It 's a fool thing , a damn fool thing . "   " Maybe so , maybe not . If people are bound to get to Oregon seems like a good way is from one boat to another , across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing would n't make no difference to us . " No , " Boone said , turning the thing over in his mind . " We get our money and he gits his 1'arnin ' . " " Where at you aim to take him ? " " Up the Medicine , maybe , and over . You know best . " " Best is up the Marias and yan way to the Flathead . The snow 'll catch him , though , and the cold . " Heavy Runner scratched his head , and Big Shield picked at the ground with a stick . Red Horn sat quiet . Only his eyes moved . It was as if he followed the talk with his eyes . Jim said , " It ai n't such a big party , just him and a couple of pork eaters to help out , and us , if you throw in . " " And a pile of stuff to tote . " " Some . " " How far does he want us ? " " I ai n't sure as to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When 'll he be ready ? " " Aims to get to McKenzie in about a moon . " " Late . Red Horn says it will be a mean winter . " Red Horn turned his deep eyes on Jim . " Heap cold . Heap snow . " " I ai n't never knowed Boone Caudill to back away from a thing on account of weather or whatever , " Jim said . " On account it 's a goddam fool thing . " Boone felt the whisky giving a bite to his words . " You 're bad as any greenhorn yourself , talkin ' about people comin ' , people comin ' , people comin ' . You seen enough to know the mountains ai n't farmin ' country , any of it , let alone this Piegan land . A farmer 'd have frost on his whiskers before the dust settled from plowin ' . " " It ai n't Piegan land the man 's pointin ' to , except to get acrost . And I ai n't sayin ' it 's farm country . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a day , easy . " " I mind the time such money were n't nothin ' . " " There ai n't no money in rememberin ' . " * ' " A man do n't need money so much . "   " It do n't hurt him . Look , Boone , it ai n't money alone , nor anythingalone . It 's money and movin ' around and havin ' fun . It 's a time since me and you had us some fun together  --  some new fun , anyhow  --  you been sittin ' in Blackfoot country so much . " Red Horn had been waiting to speak . There was a steady , hard look under his red eyelids . He hunched forward and started slow , speaking in Blackfoot . " Our old ones fought to keep the white trader away from our enemies beyond the mountains . They watched the pass that leads along the waters the Long Knife calls Maria . They met the Flatheads there , and the Kootenai . They met the Hanging Ears and the Pierced Noses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many battles . They took many scalps . They drove the enemies back . The enemies no more tried to travel the pass . To go to the hunting grounds they had to turn south and travel by the River of the Road to the Buffalo and come down the Medicine Riverto the plains . The old ones kept the white trader away . They made him travel far to the north to get to the country of the Flat- ' heads and Snakes . Our old ones were wise . They did not want the , ale aces to give medicine irons and powder and lead to our ene-mies . " Red Horn stopped , as if to let the words sink in . His nose pointedat Jim like a beak , and then at Boone . Heavy Runner had quit his scratching to listen . " The old ones were wise , " Jim agreed , and added , " for their time . " " No one travels where the old ones fought , " Red Horn went on . " The white man does not know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they knew . Only the Piegan remembers  --  thePiegan and the people that are his brothers , the Bloods and Big Bellies . " " The old ones are dead , " Jim said . " The nation comes to a new time . " " The faces of the Flatheads and the Snakes are still blacked toward us . It is not wise to let our enemies be armed . " Boone said , " It is not a trading party . The white men will not carry rifles and powder and ball across the mountains . " " The white trader goes to our enemies by other ways , " Jim argued . " He travels the Southern Pass and the trail from the Athabasca . " P268Red Horn smoothed his uniform over his chest , his eye not looking at what he was doing but fixed sharp as an awl on Boone . The lines were so deep in his cheeks they seemed to set the mouth off by itself . " My young men will not like it . My young men will get mad . They will feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no power over them . " " Red Horn will not fight the Long Knife . He has said so himself . " Boone felt anger stirring in him . Red Horn was a man right enough , no matter if he looked silly in his red suit , but there was n't any man going to scare him off a thing or tell him what to do . " My young men will get mad . " Boone held the anger back . " We are Piegans , Red Horn . We are your brothers . " " The young warriors will say that a Piegan would not show the secret of the pass . " " You can keep power over your young men if you want to . " " The white brother who goes to the enemy is not a brother . " Big Shield was nodding . The shine of the fire on his red face went up and down his cheeks as his head moved . " Goddam it ! Have it that way , then ! I reckon I 'll do as I please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , holding the swan 's wing idle in both his hands , while his mind seemed working at the English Boone had used . " No cause to git r'iled , " Jim put in . " You do n't even know you 're goin ' yet , Boone . " Teal Eye came back into the lodge , came back noiselessly and went to work again on the shirt . From the trouble in her face Boone could tell she had been listening . Christ , even a squaw cramped a man some , or anyhow wanted to ! He turned to Jim . " I been settin ' on my ass quite a spell , all right . " P269Peabody was the man 's namea Peabodyxia name that tasted strange on the tongue and sounded strange in the ear . " I am told you know the mountains as well as any man , " he said while his wide eyes pried at Boone 's face . He waited for an answer , but Boone did n't make one . There was n't any sense in answeringa thing like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's this here trip goin ' to set with the company ? " Peabody moved his plump hand around , as if the room they were in and the two wine bottles on the table were answer enough . " I have talked the matter over thoroughly with Mr. Chardon . We find no conflict of interest . None whatsoever . If one existed I hope I should be gentleman enough not to impose on the hospitality of Fort McKenzie . " Peabody 's round and earnest face turned itself on Jim and then on Boone and then opened in a little smile that made his mouth look small and babyish . " Sit down , " he invited . It was a clerk 's room they were in , Boone thought , with a fire in it and a bed held up by cottonwood blocks and a mud-and-stone chimney and a window with a broken glass . Someone had stuffed a piece of old blanket in the hole . Through his moccasins he felt the dirt floor packed hard as a slab of rock . Over his head the sod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard a mouse squeakingup there . " Have a seat , " Peabody said again while he lowered his butt to the bed . " The company can make a man a heap of trouble , one way and another , eh , Boone ? " Boone walked to the fire and turned and stepped back . He said , " Sons of bitches ! " " What is it ? " asked Peabody , and then it came to him what had been said and he ended up with " Oh . " Jim sat on a stool , looking awkward perched up that way , and began putting tobacco in his pipe . There was a lighting stick by the fire , and he picked it up and held it in the flame and got his pipe goingwith it . When Boone did n't sit down , Peabody asked , " Have another drink , " and got up and filled the glasses , and then returned to theP270bed and put his butt down again , in a neat and sort of womanish way . He was a sawed-off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot of pink in each cheek . He was a man Boone could n't picture in buckskins or even linsey but only in the brought-on clothes he wore and the brought-on shoes , as if he had been born in them and would look raw and butchered with them off . Boone stopped his walking back and forth to look down at him . " There ai n't any pass hereabouts like the Southern Pass , none so easy and open . It snows enough to cool off hell . " " Indeed ! " " What you lookin ' for  --  one short and quick , or long and easier ? " " In general , of course , a short route is to be desired but not if it is a great deal more difficult . Is there one that might become a wagon road ? " " Good Christ ! Marias Pass is open enough , if you do n't count the dead timber , but where 's the wagons as 'll roll over it ? " Peabody leaned forward , and interest seemed to bring his round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? By thunder ! " " There 's a heap of down timber in it . " " The Indians use it , do n't they ? " " Not much . Not any more . " Boone drank his wine . He could n't figure why anyone would put out wine unless he could n't get better . A man could swallow a river of it and never feel exactly good but only dull and lazy . " Are there better ways ? " Peabody asked . " Southern Pass . " " I mean in this region . " " Shorter and rougher ones . " " Suitable eventually for wagons or carts ? " " Hell , no ! " Peabody lifted his rump and went over to the table . " Wouldyou be good enough to look at the maps I have here ? " He picked upa book . " Unfortunately , Mr. Irving 's account of the journeys of CaptainBonneville is n't much help . The map it contains shows no detaileast of the Rocky Mountains . " He put the book aside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rev. Samuel Parker 's journal . " He looked up , his eyes questioning Boone . " It is a recent work . " " Wrong as hell , just the same . It ai n't but two long camps acrossthe mountains , maybe three , startin ' from the Marias canyon . ThisP271here 's supposed to be Flathead Lake , ai n't it ? And here 's the Marias . There ai n't no such stretch of country between . " " By thunder ! " said Peabody . His face looked pleased and eager . " Why' n't you just go ahead and cuss ? " Jim asked from the stool . Peabody turned aside long enough to answer . " I have neverfound it necessary . " " Helps , though . " Peabody was opening another book and flattening out the map . " This , " he said , " is the latest thing available , the Memoir Historical and Political on the Northwest Coast of North America and the Adjacent Territories , by Robert Greenhow , librarian to the Department of State . Notice what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again his face questioned Boone . " It ai n't so far wrong , " Boone said slowly while he studied the map , " savin ' on t' other side . The trail do n't lead south of the lake to Flathead House , but north . It turns northwest here , where Bear Creek flows into the middle fork of the Flathead . " " Splendid ! " said Peabody , rubbing his plump hands . " Splendid ! " He added , " By thunder ! " and looked over , quick , to Jim as if he expected him to say something . Boone said , " The time is goddam late . " " I daresay we 'll make it . " " If it was just gettin ' across , maybe yes . But Jim here says you want to go on and down the Columbia a piece . " " That 's right . " " It ai n't all-summer country , yan side of the mountains . It gits cold enough to freeze the tail off of a painter . " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " A body never can tell about God . " Boone studied Peabody , starting from his feet and going up to his head , and Peabody spoke with a stiff edge in his voice . " I believe I can go where another man can . " " I think I 'll have me a little drink , " Jim said , getting up and pouring a big one . " Wisht old Poordevil was around . He was a man , now , for a trip . That Injun could keep warm with no more'n a rabbitskin for his pizzle . Heerd tell of him lately , Boone ? " " Last I knew he was north , with the Bloods . " Boone had seen men like Peabody before , men who were simplein a way and serious as owls and so sure of themselves thatP272everything they said was a kind of brag without being a brag , either . When they got their comeuppance , it was something like a baby beinghurt . The room darkened as a cloud went across the sun . Through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the pickets and over . The pound of a blacksmith 's hammer came to his ears . He turned to Peabody . " Y'ever see a horse froze dead ? " Peabody 's wide eyes widened more , as if he was seeing the horse now . After he had taken a good look at it , he answered , " New England weather is hardly tropical , you know . " Boone poured his glass full . " I would n't know as to that . " For a while nobody said anything . Then Jim spoke up , just to make talk . " Me and Boone met up with Bonneville and Wyeth more'n once . " " They did n't come out so fat , " Boone said , watching Peabody 's face . " There are good reasons . Bonneville , for one , never knew what he was after . He chased one way and then another . He never decidedwhether he was explorer , trader , trapper , or mere adventurer . He could n't choose between fun and furs . " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim answered . " I refer to his business abilities . " " Not so different from you in looks , if only you had a bare scalp in place of that there suit of hair . " Boone asked , " What about Wyeth ? There was a man knew which way his stick floated . " Peabody nodded . " I know Wyeth personally . Splendid gentleman . He was the victim of misfortune and bad faith . If the Rocky Mountain Fur Company had kept its contract with him , I dare say he would be in the mountains still , instead of cutting ice at Cambridgefor the South American trade . " " Ice ! " Boone said . " Kin a man sell ice ? " " All the same , " Jim put in , " beaver would have petered out on him , same as on the rest . " " I 'm not interested in beaver . I 've told you that . It is developmentI 'm interested in , future development . You appear to think , because the Indians have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can . "   " They live in this country . They live off of it , and enj'y themselves and all , " Boone answered . " What in hell do you want . Christ Almighty ! " Peabody took a deep breath , as if to make sure he had wind enough for his argument . " When country which might support so many actually supports so few , then , by thunder , the inhabitants have not made good use of the natural possibilities . " His wide eyes looked at Boone , earnest and polite but not afraid . " That failure surely is justification for invasion , peaceful if possible , forcibleif necessary , by people who can and will capitalize on oppor-tunity . " " I say it 's all fool talk . " " If you live , you will realize how wrong you are . Ca n't you see ? We are growing . The nation is pushing out . New opportunities are sure to arise , bigger opportunities than ever existed in the fur trade . Transport , merchandising , agriculture , lumbering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . " " Goddam it , you talk like a man could put a plow in the land and grow corn , maybe , or sweet potatoes , or sorghum , or tobacco . The season ai n't long enough to make a crop . This here 's Injun country and huffier country , and always will be . " " I doubt what you say , even as regards this Blackfoot country itself . As for Oregon and the Willamette valley  --  " Peabody spread his hands . " The Hudson 's Bay Company has crops there , and cattle . The missions are doing well . A hundred settlers went there this past summer under the leadership of Dr. Elijah White . " Peabody 's mouth was drawn straight in his round face . The pink in his cheeks had spread out so that most of his face seemed red . He took another breath deep in his belly , as if to send his big words out again , but all he said was , " I did n't come to debate but to hire guides . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white handkerchiefthat he pulled from the pocket of his roundabout . Jim took the glass from his mouth long enough to say , " It 's British country acrost the mountains . How you aim to fix that ? " " It is n't British country . It 's joint-occupancy territory , by treaty . " " I reckon the Hudson 's Bay Company ai n't heard about that . " " I understand the settlers are n't being treated too badly . ThatP274question aside , do you think the United States of America will let the company , or even the British army itself , stand in the way ? Nothing shall stop us . British ? Spanish ? Mexicans ? None of them . By every reasonable standard the land is ours  --  by geography , contiguity , natural expansion . Why , it 's destiny , that 's what it is  --  inevitable destiny . " Jim grinned and his arm came out stiff and his finger pointed . " Hurrah for the first gov'nor ! " His glance came over to Boone . " A man that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn his hand . " Peabody was flushed with talking . He flushed hotter at Jim 's words and got out his white handkerchief again . " I reckon we 'll have a time of it , just the same , pushin ' them Britishers into the sea , " Jim said . Peabody took his cup of wine from the table and sat on the bed and took a bare nip and clamped his lips over it and held it in his mouth for a while without swallowing , as if to get all the good out of it before giving it up to his stomach . Boone let himself down and sat cross-legged on the floor . " How far you want us ? " " To the head of navigation on the Columbia , at least . " " For big boats or small ? " " We shall have to see . " " You figure to stop at Hudson Bay forts ? " " Perhaps not . " Peabody considered . " Perhaps it would be best not to . Not this trip . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say wait until summer . " Peabody shook his round head while his mouth made the tight line again above the small , square chin . " That point is settled . I am not going to lie idle because of a little unpleasant weather . If you wo n't take me , I shall look for someone else . " - Jim had his knife out and was whittling on the stool between his spread legs . " Here 's a hoss as knows his own mind . " " Mr. Chardon thinks the snow in the mountains presents no obstacles as yet . " " Could be he wants to get you froze , " said Boone . " Once it makes up its mind to snow in this country , by God she snows , " Jim added . " Chardon tell you that ? " " You have n't given me your answers . "   " If a man was smart now , I reckon he 'd hoof it . " Jim 's gaze was on Boone . " I have equipment , you know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in handy , if we get snowed in and no game about . There 's worse doin 's than horse meat . " Peabody 's round face got a look of surprise on it . " And if snow kep ' away , " Jim said , " we 'd get through that much quicker . " " Are you accepting , then ? " " Reckon I 'll go , like I told you once , " Jim answered . " It ai n't me you need so much as Caudill , though . I never traveled this here pass . What you say , Boone ? " " I say it 's a crazy idea . There wo n't be no sight of people travelin ' this way , ever , and no sight of people fixin ' to farm . It 's too cold and dry and windy for folks . Them as try it will clamp their tails down and run for home , if their scalps ai n't already on a coup stick . And some will starve and some will freeze . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's plumb dangerous to go now . That 's what I say , and dangerouser if we got to dodge the British forts . " " There 's danger , all right , " Jim agreed . " Red Horn , now , he do n't want us to go . " " Goddam Red Horn ! " " I do n't understand , " Peabody put in . " Who is Red Horn ? " " It do n't amount to anything , " Boone answered . " Just Injun talk . " " He do n't like it , though , Boone . Maybe we 'd best give it up , account of him . " " Damn you , Jim . You just aim to get my dander up . " " Is she up enough ? " There was a crooked smile on Jim 's face . He went on , " I ai n't just devilin ' you . Come on , Boone ! It wo n't be no fun without you . Tell the man yes . " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me around . " " That 's he-bear talk now . " Peabody was looking from one to the other of them . A little frown sat over his eyes . " I 'm not sure I follow you , " he said to Boone . " It ai n't no skin off of me . Me and Jim can get us out of a fix , P276all right enough , not sayin ' we can do the same for you . I 'll p'int the way . " " Splendid ! " The little man rubbed his fat hands together and reached over suddenly and got his glass from the table and took a whole swallow all at once . " I 'll need help and advice getting ready . My two French Canadians wo n't be of much assistance there . If you want to lend a hand , I 'll start your pay at once , at the agreed rate of a dollar and a half . " " Might as well , " Jim said . " I 'm that poor I could n't buy a bead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French ? " Boone asked . " They 're named Zenon and Beauchamp . This Beauchamp is a powerful man . " " Hope they know how to pack a horse . Me and Jim , we figger just to raise meat and lead the way . " Boone walked over and let himself out of the room . Rooms made a man feel shut in on himself ; they made him uneasy , so 's his mind never rightly put itself to a thing but kept thinking about a way out , like a mouse in a bucket . He walked past the cannon and the flagstaff . A sleepy gate watcher let him out of the inner gate . There were a couple of Bloods in the Indian store and one man he took to be a Cree , acting pretty well drunked up . " No whisky , " the clerk was saying . " No got medicine water . " The Cree came over to Boone , begging tobacco . He was a stout Indian , not tall , but built wide and chesty . Boone shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached up and grabbed one of his braids of hair to hold him by , saying something in his throat while he yanked . Boone hit him in the belly and heard the wind grunt out of him and felt the hand let go the plait . The Cree bent over , his arms wrapped across his belly . Boone hit him again , striking up in the face , and the Cree slammed backwards on the dirt floor and lay still . There was n't anything said , not by the clerk or the two Bloods . Boone felt their eyes following him as he went through the big gate to the outside . The sun had lost itself behind some clouds to the west , and a keen chill had fallen on the land . It would be dark soon . With wintercoming on , the sun no more than took a peek at things and then ducked behind the mountains . Smoke was coming from the tepeesP277pitched around the fort , rising gray to the cold sky . There was the smell of wood smoke in the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right the river ran dull as lead . Teal Eye would be waiting for him in the lodge she had pitched . She would be waiting and wondering , but she would n't ask when he got there . She would see there was meat for him and that the fire was good , and all the time her eyes would be on him with the unaskedquestion in them , and her face with a light in it that he had noticed lately , a kind of soft gleam through the flesh . She would n't ask , but all her small ways would be listening ways , bringing the answer to her from his looks or his motions or the tone of his voice . A woman got a hold on a man and pushed him one way and another without so much as opening her mouth . Sensing her all around him , a man did n't feel like his own self sometimes . He wanted to shake loose and say to hell with it and strike out somewhere , with nothing hanging to him of what he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it , though , not forever  --  not if he had a woman like Teal Eye . A little time away from her was enough , four moons maybe , while he took a crazy by-thunder Yankee across to Oregon . It was just as Boone had known it would be . There was jerkedmeat , boiled and cooked with pounded prairie turnips , andthe fire warm in its circle of stones , and Teal Eye doing around while the edge of her eye kept on him and her face waited for what might come to her ear or eye . He grunted and sat down and ate out of a bowl and afterwards fired his pipe with the trader 's black tobaccomixed with the bark of the red willow . It was a soft-stone pipe he had , with a round bowl on a square base and a willow stem . He had made it himself , after the style of the Blackfeet , and while it was n't as fancy as some that other tribes made , it was sweet and drew easy . He studied it while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a while , without looking at Teal Eye , he said in Blackfoot , " You will go back to Red Horn and wait . " P278She did n't need to say anything , not with the quick look on her face . He counted on his fingers . " After six sleeps we will start . " He let his glance go to her while he pulled on his pipe . " Red Hair and I and the white man and two Bad Medicines . " She bent her head and her hands made a little flutter above her leather skirt . She said , " I will get the warm clothes ready . " It was one of the things he prized her for , that she did n't argue . For all that her eyes might say , or her face or her hands , the mouth did n't come out with it . He spoke his mind , and that was that , and he did n't have to fuss about it . It saved a man a heap of bother . Her look questioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of the big winds I will be back , or sooner if the winter opens , in the time when the great owl nests . " She said , without looking at him , " You will come back ? " " In the time of the big winds , or sooner . " " You will come back to the Piegans ? " " I told you once I would ! " he answered sharply in English . " Think I aim to stay with the Flatheads or Snakes or somebody ? " " Every day I shall look to the west . " She sat quiet , looking down at her hands . " I reckon you could get yourself another man , if it came to that . " She got up , not speaking , as if what he had said had hurt her inside . " Jim would take you , I reckon . " The wind whistled in the tops of the lodgepoles overhead and a puff of it came down the smoke hole and chased the smoke around . Dark was settling inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would sleep on his rifle tonight . A man could n't tell what some crazy Blood might take it into his head to do after filling up on firewater . Teal Eye was already under the robe when he went to it and put himself down with his feet to the fire . He lay there , letting things run in his head , thinking she was asleep , and then her hand came over and barely touched him and her voice said , " Strong Arm will have a son . " He said , " For Christ sake ! " and thought about it some more and said , " For Christ sake ! " again . P279A man wondered what his young one would look like and what he would be like . It gave a man a solid feeling , knowing he had got himself a pup . He went to sleep with his mind on it . Once he awakened , thinking he had felt Teal Eye shaking under the robe , thinking he had heard a little held-in cry , but all there was was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From high in the canyon one could look down on the foothillsand far beyond them to the yellow plains shimmeringunder the early winter sun . Elisha Peabody checked his horse . It was an enormous world , a world of heights and depths and distances that numbed the imagination . One felt inclined to draw into himself , like a turtle . The mountains were loftier than any Peabody ever had seen ; the streams were swifter , the wind fiercer , the air sharper , the view vaster . It occurred to him that everything had been made to giant 's measure ; it was as if proportionhad run wild . The great sprawling magnitude of the west made the hills and parks of home seem small and artificial , like a yard with a picket fence around it . The human soul inclined to extremes , too . Yesterday it had soared , feeling wild and free , feeling so inconsequential among these physical immensities as to be lost to the sight of God and His wrath . Last night , with the great darkness crowding in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the awful power and glory of God all about . Peabody knew humility then , and prayed for guidance and strength and God 's favor , without which even Yankee ingenuitycould be of no avail . Today there rode with him a small burden of oppression that no circumstance could account for , unless it was that the wordless vigilance of Caudill had given rise to a vague and foolish misgiving . More than once Caudill had hitched around in his saddle to study the way they had come . Under the black brows his eyes were always busy , scanning the slopes , the timber , the stream , the game trails . What his eyes told him his mouth did not utter or his expression reveal . There wasP280the sharp awareness of a wild animal in his face , but nothing more . A strange man , Boone Caudill , riding rawboned and slouched at the head of the column while his Indian 's braids swung to the swing of his horse . A strange man , with moodiness in him , and quickness to anger and the promise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kentucky frontier that had made him what he was , or his years with the red Arabs of the plains ? Watching him ride ahead , his strong shoulders loose and his body giving to the pace of his horse , Peabody concluded he was more Indian than white man . Outwardly he was hardly white man at all . He wore the clothes of an Indian and carried a bag of amulets  --  a medicine bundle , as it was called . His voice was rough and deep in his chest , even when the sounds it made were English sounds . His face was dark-eyed , weathered , and often inscrutable . He had a squaw for a wife . Caudill could be a difficult man , even a dangerous one , Peabodyimagined . One of gentler breeding sometimes felt uncertain and impotent in his presence , as if the strength and forwardness and primitive masculinity of the man dwarfed any disciplined powers . Peabody shrugged that feeling away while his eyes ranged far out on the plains . A Yankee could hold his own in any company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had demonstratedthrough generations . Caudill would be a penniless white renegade among the Indians long after his own enterprise and vision had made him comfortable and important . His eye came back up the canyon , following the winding stream , until it reached the pack string and saw Deakins sitting quiet on his horse at the tail of it , waiting for Peabody to go on . Deakins grinned , showing a flash of teeth . He and Caudill had come from different molds . Where Caudill was silent , Deakins talked ; where Caudill flared out , Deakins fashioned a joke ; where there was in Caudill the suggestion of quick ferocity , there was in Deakins the indication of considered action . Whimsicality was a part of Deakins ' make-up , and humor , half-sly , half-innocent , so that one never quite knew the depth of his perception . The two constituted a good if godless pair , the one balancing and conditioningthe other . Peabody kicked his horse , and heard the pack animals behind him clumping into action and Zenon chattering French . He couldP281picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and expressive under eyes as eloquent as any maiden 's . He could see his small hands moving as he talked . Occasionally he heard Beauchamp answer Zenon 's fluent words . Beauchamp was a heavy wedge of a man with the neck and shoulders of a bull and a skull inhabitedby a slow brute wit . Against Zenon 's quick understanding he matched his muscle , as if in the final reckoning it was force that told the measure of a man . He liked to show the knot of muscle on his biceps and to seize Zenon 's arm afterward and make him wince with the power of his grip . He had liked to , that is , until Deakins interfered on their second night out from Fort McKenzie . " If I was Zenon , now , I would shoot that damn hand of yours off , I would , " Deakins had said . Peabody saw , with a little turn of astonishment , that the twinkle was gone from his blue eyes . Beauchamp let go of Zenon . It was an instant before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his strength . Then he said , " By damn , me think you need one fusil , to stand with Beauchamp . " Before Deakins could answer , Caudill stepped around the fire . Wordless , he walked up to Beauchamp . Peabody remembered how deliberately he stepped and how suddenly he struck . Miraculously , Beauchamp kept his feet . He staggered back , almost falling , but caught his balance and stood silent as if allowing time for thought to turn in his head . He brought up his hand to feel of his jaw . His eyes dropped from Caudill 's face and went to the ground and hunted around . Peabody was reminded of a mouse seeking a hole . " There ai n't no real fight in him , Zenon , " Caudill said . " No need to be afeard of him . He only looks like a man . " There had been no trouble since , nor , Peabody imagined , was there likely to be any . Beauchamp was like an ox tamed by the whip , with no resentment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did his work . Altogether , thought Peabody , he had a good crew . He turned his mind away from the reasonless oppressionhe felt , thinking of the good crew , the open weather , the purposefulprogress they were making . Oregon lay just beyond the hills . God willing , he would reach the Columbia . As they traveled the canyon , bearing to the southwest , it seemed more and more logical to assume that God was willing , for the way lay wide and easy , except for windfall and the new growthP282that had sprung up along the trails that forgotten Indians had worn . On all sides the mountains lifted in great peaks and bulges of rock , thrusting so high that white clouds moved among them ; the wind blew the keen breath of winter , sometimes with the spit of storm in it ; but the pass rolled on , gradual and safe and bare of snow . It was more than Peabody had dared hope for , by thunder . Looking into the future , one could see pack trains climbing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods , bound for the fertile valleys of the Columbia . They would be free men , these , without a slave among them  --  free men going to free country to establish what would come to be free states of the Union , once the claims of the British had been dismissed . Afterward the lanes of commerce would open , replacing the long , slow sea route around the Horn . He could see cargoes going up and down the Missouri and the Columbia and being transshipped across the mountains over the very ground his horse trod  --  cargoes of processed goody and imports , of textiles , tools , rifles , coffee , tea , and sugar , flowing west in exchange for the products the settlers had wrested from the new land . How could South Pass , without the benefits of navigation , rival the course he was traveling ? There would be opportunityhere for men of industry and foresight . He who was early on the ground would have the better chance . He who knew the way could profit by his knowledge . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate and land to be dealt in . Once one was familiar with the country he would know where to direct his energies . Boston men would be told of the pass , and Boston men would be acquainted with the possibilities , and Boston money , hitherto so cautious , would answer to the assuranceof tidy earnings . Peabody brought his compass and notebookfrom his pocket . Tonight , by the light of the campfire , he would enlarge on this hasty sketching . The column slowed and shuffled to a stop as Caudill stopped to look up and down the canyon . After a while he slipped from his horse and tied it to a limb and came back to borrow Peabody 's glass . All he said when he handed it back was " Let 's git on . " Peabodyused the glass himself while Caudill returned to the head of the string . His horse kept moving under him , nosing for spears of cured grass , with the result that his eye could n't fix on a place . Things swam into sight and out again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winding , the mountains shouldering up to the timber line . He took the glass from his eye . The plains were shut off from sight here . One felt alone with the great hills ; one felt imprisoned , and voiceless in an eternal silence ; one felt buried below the ragged spires that pierced the sky . Fort McKenzie was a lifetimeaway , a five-day lifetime away . Where the trail dipped down to water , Caudill brought the string to a halt for the night . The stream was little more than a trickle now , chuckling over stones slick with rusty moss . Peabody imagined he could see the divide ahead , where the sun was sinking in a fiery glory . He got off his horse and held to the saddle for a minute while his stiff legs renewed their acquaintance with earth . The sunset held him . He could lose himself in it .

" We 'll keep the horses close up , " Caudill said for the benefit of the Frenchmen . " Soon 's we get ' em unpacked just take ' em to that little flat there , and remember to hobble ' em , every head . " " Meat 's almighty scarce , " Deakins observed while Peabody fumbled at his saddle . " Ai n't seed elk nor deer since morning , and little sign . " Peabody pulled the saddle off and laid it for a pillow where he planned to make his bed . It gave him a certain feeling of pride to perform his share of the tasks . " At the rate we 're going , we 'll be in the Flathead basin before we want for more game . " " Shoo ! " answered Deakins , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses away .

They want to grab things for their own and close a country up . Who you think the country belongs to , anyway , Peabody ? " " I imagine the man who cleared the way would have some rights to levy on those who used it . " " It do n't make no difference , " said Caudill more mildly while he plied his knife . " A tollman could hold his hand out until Christ come again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind 's eye Peabody saw the wagons rolling and the collectorbusy making change . His gaze went to Caudill . Something in the man was a challenge to him . It was as if self-respect demandedthat he provoke him more . " It is n't too difficult to think that some day , maybe in our own time , the steam railway will be heard clanking over this pass , carrying passengers three hundred miles in twenty-four hours . " " Your head 's got room for the damndest notions . " " It 's ag'in nature , " Deakins answered . He already had speared a chunk of meat on a stick . " Why' n't God put wheels on a man if he aimed for him to hump it so ? " " People are going against nature in four or five states already , then , and not being hurt by it .

Zenon squatted down afterward with his knees up under his chin , watching his roast cook . Caudill laid the side of ribs close to the coals . Peabody dipped a can of water from the stream and set it to heat . Straight meat was a diet that grew agreeable with use , and it so simplified the business of cooking that a mountain traveler felt disinclined to make use of the flour and meal he had packed . AP285civilized stomach demanded a swallow of coffee , though , with a generousaddition of sugar . Watching him , Beauchamp said , " Me think good .

Of it all , only one thin red streak remained above the hills , and even as he watched , it darkened and the mountainsbegan to lose outline against the sky . Darkness seemed to squeeze around him  --  darkness and silence , made the darker and silenter by the little flame of the campfire and the=mindles " s chuckle of the water . The cold crept through his woolens and lay like metal along his skin . He pushed his feet closer to the fire . Perhaps Caudill was right , saying Indian shoes kept the feet warmer than the cobbler'sproduct . Caudill licked his fingers and wiped them on his buckskins and drew the knife across the leather to clean it and then put it back in its case . Not until he had fired his pipe did he speak . Then he said , " We 'd best set a guard . " " Set a guard ? " Peabody asked . He saw the campfire mirrored minutely in Zenon 's lifted eyes . " Just playin ' safe , " Caudill replied .

" He paused for a minute and added , " That 's **27;1829;TOOLONG a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even impressed by either title or unearned increment . He had created wealth and fame for himself . The guests of Lord Haddonfield for this week end were varied , but distinguished . From London , the day before , had come Sir Charles Stoneledge , an actor of position and fame in the London theatrical world , but a stagey and affected individual who seized every opportunity to visit aristocratic friends or acquaintances . He had brought with him Miss Constance Hathaway , an actress then playing in the popular success , Sentiment . By way of contrast , there were Lord and Lady Ettinge , he rather prominent in railway and shipping interests  --  a large , florid , dictatorialman , inclined to drink heavily and , when sufficiently in his cups , genial in a limited way . When cold sober , he was given to sharp obiter dicta rather than to facile argument . Lady Ettinge , on the other hand , was extremely diplomatic , and on this occasion had been invited by Lord Haddonfield to act as hostess . Well aware of her husband 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she in no way submerged her own personality . She was tall and heavily built , blue veined , red cheeked , and having rather hard blue eyes . Once she had been as fair and engaging as any lovely maid of sixteen , and remembered it well , as did Ettinge . He had courted her earnestly . She had a better sense of proportion than her husband . He , being one of a long line and inheriting wealth , was inclined to give weight and precedence to primogeniture rather than to immediate achievement , even though he himself was active enough commercially . His wife , however , though as wellborn as himself , was more interested and aware of the changing forces of the day , and inclined to admire such untitled giants as Cowperwood . Also present were Lord and Lady Bosvike , both young and smart and very popular . They were clever at all sports , enjoyed gambling and the races , and were valuable in any gathering because of their enthusiasm and gaiety . Secretly they laughed at Ettinge and his wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberatelyset themselves out to be agreeable to them . A really important guest  --  decidedly so in the eyes of Haddonfield and Ettinge  --  was Abington Scarr . A man of rather dubious origin  --  no title , no family  --  nevertheless he was making quite a financial stir at this time . For one thing , in the past four years , he had been successful in organizing a cattle-raising company in Brazil . The profits from this were already yielding his investors a handsome return . He was now interested in sheep-raising in Africa , where , by reason of almost unheard-of concessions from the government and the methods he had devised for reducing costs and finding markets , he was looked upon as one who might shortly come to be a millionaire . The shrewdest criticisms of his ventures on the part of those who were inclined to doubt had not yet developed anything seriouslyinimical to his claims . Haddonfield , as well as Ettinge , was impressed by his success , but at the same time both were wary of following him . They did speculate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One thing that Scarr was seeking to promote at this time  --  but with less success than in the case of most of his earlier ventures  --  was the Baker Street &; Waterloo Line , a new Londonunderground , for which he had secured a franchise from Parliament . And it was in connection with this that the unexpected appearance of Cowperwood interested him . Because of Aileen 's determination to make an elaborate toilet , the Cowperwoods were late in coming down to dinner . When they entered the drawing room , most of the other guests had assembled and were somewhat annoyed at having to wait . Ettinge , in particular , had decided to pay no great attention to the Cowperwoods . But when they appeared , and Haddonfield called out a hearty welcome , the others turned at once , resumed their amiability and took an unaffectedinterest in the Americans . Ettinge , slouching to a standing position and bowing stiffly as he was introduced , nevertheless studied Cowperwood intently . And Lady Ettinge , who had been following the recent English comments on his affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cowperwood was the leading personality at this gathering . Instinctively , she forgave him for Aileen , judging that he had married young and later philosophically decided to make the best of an unfortunate union . As for Scarr , he was intelligent enough to realize that he was in the presence of a master in his own world . A little ill at ease after her long period of neglect in New York , Aileen did her best to appear natural , yet succeeded only in being overcordial and almost eager , as she smiled at everyone . She made remarks which established in the minds of all that she was quite uncertain of herself . Cowperwood noted it , but decided that , after all , he could manage for her . And , with his usual diplomacy , he addressed himself to Lady Ettinge as the oldest and , plainly , the most significant woman guest . " I am rather new to English country life , " he said , quite simply , " but I must say , even the little glimpse I 've had of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon it . " " Indeed ! " said Lady Ettinge , a little curious as to his tastes and temperament . " You find it as engaging as all that ? " " Yes , and I think I can explain why . It is the source of what at present is best in my own country . " He emphasized the words " at present , " as she noted . " The culture of Italy , " he went on , " we can appreciate as that of a people entirely different from us ; and the same , I think , is true of France and Germany . But here we recognize naturally , and with sympathy , the sources of our own culture and development , even those of us who are not wholly of English ex-traction . " " You sound almost too kind to England , " said Lady Ettinge . " Are you of English descent ? " " Yes , my parents were Quakers . I was brought up in full knowledge of the simplicity of the English Quakers . " " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Mr. Cowperwood can speak with knowledge of any country , " said Lord Haddonfield , drawing near , " for he has spent a fortune and a great many years in assembling the art of all of them . " " My collection is very modest , " said Cowperwood . " I look upon it merely as a beginning . " " And this art collection is housed in one of the most beautiful museums I have ever visited , " continued Lord Haddonfield , addressingLady Ettinge . " It is in Mr. Cowperwood 's home in New York . " " I had the pleasure of hearing a discussion of your collection when I was last in New York , Mr. Cowperwood , " interjected Stoneledge . " Is it true that you are over here to add to it ? I believe I read something of the sort the other day . " " Unfounded rumor , " replied Cowperwood . " I am not collecting anything at the moment but impressions . I 'm merely on my way to the Continent . " Pleased beyond words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aileen was extremely gay throughout dinner , so much so that Cowperwood , from time to time , cast a questioning glance inp103her direction , as he was especially eager to make a favorable impression . He knew , of course , about the financial interests of Haddonfieldand Ettinge , and now here was Scarr , who , he had heard , was seeking to promote an underground . Concerning Lord Ettinge , he was interested to find out what he could about his influence and connections , and in that direction he was not unsuccessful , for Lady Ettinge spoke to him frankly of her husband 's political interests . He was a Tory , and in close touch with the leaders of the Tory party , and was being considered at the present time for an importantIndian appointment . It all depended on certain political eventualitiesbound up in the Boer War , then shaking England . So far , the losses had been almost continuous . But the tendency of the presentcompany was to minimize that unfortunate fact , and Cowperwood , for diplomatic reasons , took the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other guests , he was asking himself who , of all these , could be of use to himself as well as Berenice . Lady Bosvike invited him to her lodge in Scotland . Scarr , after the ladies left the table , was the first to draw near and ask him if he were to be long in England . If so , he would like him to visit his place in Wales . Even Ettinge had , by this time , unbent sufficiently to discuss matters American and international . And this relation was strengthened on Monday , when there was a shooting party , and Cowperwood was seen to be not without skill . In fact , by the time the Cowperwoods prepared to leave , he had won the admiration of all of Haddonfield 's guests , if the same could not wholly be said of Aileen . CALLING at Berenice 's apartment on hisreturn from Beriton Manor , Cowperwoodfound her preparing for an inspection trip to one of the cottagessuggested by Colonel Hawkesberry as a desirable summer residence for her and her mother . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Maidenhead and Marlow . " And who do you think is the owner ? " she asked him , with a suggestion of mystery and surprise . " Not the slightest idea , unless I try to read your mind . " " Then try . "  | " Not me ! Too difficult . ' Who is it ? " " None other than that English lord your Mr. Sippens wrote you about , unless there are two lords of the same name . Lord Stane . " " Not really ? " said Cowperwood , surprised by the coincidence . " Tell me about it . Have you met him ? " " No . But Colonel Hawkesberry is most enthusiastic about the place , says it 's just near enough to London . And then , too , he and his sistah ah theyah ! " She mimicked the absent Hawkesberry . " Such being the case , I think we might very well look at it , " concludedCowperwood , at the same time noting with admiration her attractive costume : long skirt and tight jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a gold belt . A small green hat , flaunting a single red feather , was perched on the side of her head . " I 'd like to meet Stane , " continued Cowperwood , " and this may be a way to do it . But caution is the word here , Bevy . I understand he is wealthy , and very influential . If we could interest him on our own terms . . . " He paused . " Just what I 've been thinking , " she said . " So why not come along with me now to see it ? Mother is tired today and is staying home . " Her manner , as usual , was light , evasive , bantering , the way which most pleased Cowperwood , since it so wholly reflected her natural strength , resourcefulness , and optimism under any and all circumstances . " The pleasure of chaperoning this costume , apart from anything else , is enough ! " said Cowperwood . " Of course , " continued Berenice , " I 've explained to everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I can make any decisions . Are you prepared to assume your duties ? " she queried , with the sauciest of glances . He walked over to her and took her in his arms . " It 's all new to me , of course , but I 'll try . " " Well , anyway , " said Berenice , " I 'm making it easy for you . I 've consulted a renting agent , and he will meet us at Windsor . After that I thought we might find a nice little old inn for tea . " " Righto ! as we say over here . But first , a word with your mother . " And he hurried into Mrs. Carter 's room . " Well , Hattie , " he greeted her . " How 's everything ? How are you making out in dear old England ? "  |p105In  contrast with Berenice 's gaiety , her mother looked not only depressed but a little worn . It had all been so swift , this brilliant and colorful descent from her fool 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , however lavish its accouterments , was nevertheless frightening because of lurking danger ahead . This perplexing business of living ! True , she had bred a gifted and selfsufficientdaughter , but one as headstrong and lawless as herself . And one whose fate , for that reason , could not accurately be predicted . And although Cowperwood had always been and was now content to fortify them with the enormous resources of his mind and his wealth , yet she was fearful . The fact that he had brought them to England at a time when he was so openly courting public favor , and with Aileen in the immediate foreground , puzzled her . According to Berenice , this course was necessary , even if not entirelyacceptable . But this explanation did not entirely convince her . She had lived and lost , and the ghost that was tracking her was the fear that Berenice would also lose . For there was Aileen , and the fickleness of Cowperwood , and the relentless world , sparing no one , forgivingno one . It was something of all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her relaxed figure . Unknown to Berenice , she had returned to drinking , and , but a moment or two before Cowperwood entered , had drained a large glass of brandy in order to brace herself for this certain encounter . In answer to his greeting , she said : " Oh , I like England very much . Bevy is fascinated by everything here . I suppose you 're going out to look at those cottages . It 's just a question of the number of people you expect to entertain , or , rather , whom not to entertain , with you two together . " " I think you 're speaking for Bevy , not me . She seems to be the magnet . But you look a little down , Hattie . What 's the matter ? " He eyed her questioningly , but not unsympathetically . " Come , come , do n't let these first days get on your nerves ! I know it 's all a little difficult . You 've had a trying trip , and you 're tired . " He crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder , but in doing so caught the odor of brandy . " Listen , Hattie , " he said , " you and I have known each other for a long time . You know that although I 've always been infatuated with Bevy , I never indulged in so much as a single gesture that could compromise her in any way , before she came to me in Chicago . Is that true , or is n't it ? "  | " Yes , Frank , it 's true . " " You know , my one desire , since I felt I could not have her , was to place her socially , get her married and off your hands before anythingcould go wrong . " " Yes , I know . " " Of course , what happened in Chicago is to be charged to me , but even that not entirely , for she came to me at a time when I was very much in need of her . Otherwise , I think I might have resisted her even then . Anyway , we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swim . You look on this adventure over here as hopeless . I can see that . I do n't . Remember , Bevy is a very brilliant and resourceful girl . And this is England , not the United States . People over here make way for intelligence and beauty in a way that has never yet been dreamed of at home . If you will only brace up and play your part , everything will be all right . " Once more he patted her shoulder , looking down into her eyes to note the effect of his words . " You know I 'll do my best , Frank , " she said . " Well , there 's one thing you must not do , Hattie , and that 's to take up drinking . You know your weakness . And if Bevy finds it out , it might discourage her and undo everything we are trying to do . " " Oh , I 'll do anything , Frank , anything , if only I can make up to her for other things I have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he smiled an encouraging smile , and left her to join Berenice . IN THE railway carriage Cowperwooddiscussed with Berenice the fears of her mother . She assured him that they meant nothing , it was merely the sudden change . With a little success here , she would feel better . " If trouble comes from anywhere , it 's likely to come from visiting Americans , not the English people , " she added , thoughtfully , as they passed one charming scene after another , almost unnoted by them for the moment . " And I certainly do not intend to accept introductionsto Americans , or invitations from them here in London , or entertain them either , if I can avoid it . "  | " You 're right as to that , Bevy . It 's the wisest thing to do . " " They are the people who terrify Mother . You know , Americans somehow have n't the manners or courtesy or tolerance of these people over here . I feel at home here . " " It 's their older culture and diplomacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are less outspoken , slower to jump at conclusions . We Americans have taken an undeveloped continent , and are developingit , or trying to , in a very few years , whereas these people have been working on this little island for a thousand years . " At Windsor they were met by Mr. Warburton , the renting agent , who had much to say about the property he was going to show . It was really one of the most charming places on the river . Lord Stane had occupied it for years until a few summers ago . " Since his father 's death , " the agent explained , confidentially , " he has gone mostly to Tregasal , where his main property lies . Last year he let this place to the actress , Miss Constance Hathaway , but this year she is going to Brittany , and it was only a month or two ago that Lord Stane told me I might let it if I found a suitable tenant . " " Has he much of an estate in Tregasal ? " asked Cowperwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered the agent . " About five thousand acres . A really beautiful place , although he seldom uses it . " At that moment a troublesome thought entered Cowperwood 's mind . Insisting to himself that he would never again allow himself to be aroused by jealousy , still the truth was that since Berenice had come into his life , he was beginning to feel the pangs . She was so much of all that he desired . Might she not , under such circumstancesas these , prefer a younger , if equally brilliant and resourceful , man ? Could he expect to hold her if she were to meet and come to know such a personality as Stane ? The thought injected into his relationship with Berenice a tinge of something which previously had not been there . Pryor 's Cove proved to be a dream of architecture and landscape gardening . It was over a hundred years old , though most modernly equipped , and trailed along for nearly a hundred feet in a straight line . Under great trees rather grandly overtopping its eighteen feet of height @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hedges , flower gardens , and kitchen gardens . At the rear , to the south of the house where it faced the river , was a double ell of picturesque Leicestershire stables , with quaint fences , gates , rockeries , and bird- houses , and , as Mr. Warburton pointed out , there were riding and driving horses for the use of the tenant , black Minorca chickens , sheep dogs , and a flock of sheep , all looked after by a gardener , a hostler , and a farmer , the tenant acquiring their labor along with the house . Cowperwood , like Berenice , was charmed by the bucolic atmosphere : the glasslike smoothness of the Thames , which crept slowly and silently toward London ; the wide expanse of lawn which led down to the river ; and the brightly awninged houseboat , with its fluttering curtains and wicker chairs and tables , moored to a landing . He mused over a sundial which stood in the center of a path leading down to the houseboat . How time was passing ! He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet this younger man , who might interest her . On coming to him in Chicago a few months before , Berenice had said she was her own mistress , and came to him only because she desired to do so . And when she no longer desired him , she would leave him . Of course , he need not take this place , and he need not deal with Stane financially . There were other men and other ways . Abington Scarr and Lord Ettinge were possibilities . Why entertain the fear of defeat ? He had lived a full life and would continue to do so whatever happened . He noted Berenice exultingly admiring the beauties of this place . Unconscious of his thoughts , she was already wondering to herself about Lord Stane . He could not be very old , as she had heard that he had only recently come into these great properties of his father 's . However , she was chiefly arrested by the social character of the neighborhood , as described by Mr. Warburton . For in the immediatevicinity dwelt Mr. Arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Heberman Kipes , of the Consolidated British Tiles &; Patterns Company ; the Honorable Runciman Maynes , of the Secretariat for the Colonies ; together with various other Sir Bigwigs and Sir Littlewigs and hostesses of title and achievement . Cowperwood was likewise interested by all this , and wondered what Berenice and her mother were likely to make of it . During the spring and summer here , she now pointed out , there would be house parties , garden parties , and country reunions of London city groups in politics , government , the arts , and society , so that with proper introductions one 's days and nights might be filled . " In fact , " commented Cowperwood at this point , " altogether anp109atmosphere in which one could rise or sink , and that most swiftly and fatefully either way . " " Quite ! " said Berenice . " But one in which I should try to rise . " He was once more captivated by her optimism and courage . And then the agent , who had gone over to examine the hedges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have just advised Miss Fleming , " he said , without a previous word to Berenice , " that she and her mother have my permission to lease this place , if they choose . You may send the necessary papers to my solicitor . A mere formality , but a part of my legal duty as Miss Fleming 's guardian , you know . " " Certainly , I understand , Mr. Cowperwood , " said the agent . " But it will be a few days before the papers are ready , possibly not before next Monday or Tuesday , as Lord Stane 's agent , Mr. Bailey , will not be back before then . " Cowperwood was somewhat gratified to learn that Stane did not trouble with his own renting details . That would keep his name out of it for the present , anyway . As for the future , he could not help wondering a little ... . Cowperwood 's TOUR of the undergrounds , with Sippens as his guide , having confirmed his opinion as to the importance of securing the Charing Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with interest to the interview with Greaves and Henshaw in his office this morning . It was Greaves who took the lead in the opening conversation . " We want to know , Mr. Cowperwood , " he began , " if you are willing to take a 51 per cent interest in the Charing Cross line , providedwe undertake to raise proportionately the amount necessary to build the line . " " Proportionately ? " queried Cowperwood . " It depends on what you mean by that . If the line should cost  --  i , 000,000 , do you guaranteeto furnish approximately  --  450,000 ? " " Well , " said Greaves , somewhat hesitantly , " not directly out of our own pockets . We have some connections which might join us in furnishing it . "  | " You did n't appear to have any such connections when I saw you in New York , " said Cowperwood , " and since then I have decided that  --  30,000 for a 51-per-cent interest in a company which has only a franchise and some debts , is my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nothing else , going begging here , as it is . I have had time to find that out . If you are coming to me with a positive guarantee of the  --  450,000 which the building of 49 per cent of this line is likely to cost , I might be interested . But since you are merely waiting to have me agree to take 51 per cent so that on the strength of that you may be able to raise your 49 per cent , I ca n't see it . You have really only your rights to offer . Under the circumstances , I must ask for a full control or nothing . For it is only with full control that I will be able to raise the very large amount of money it is going to take to do this . And no one should know that better than you two gentlemen . Therefore , unless you can see your way clear to take my final offer  --  which is  --  30,000 for your option , together with a continuance of your contract to build  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Whereupon he took out his watch , a gesture which confirmed a suspicion in the minds of both Greaves and Henshaw that unless they decided here and now , this was the end . They looked at each other questioningly , and then Henshaw spoke : " Assuming that we sell you this complete control , Mr. Cowperwood , what guarantee have we that you would immediately proceedwith the building of this line ? For if we do not get the constructionwork out of it within a reasonable time , I can not see that we are getting anything . " " I feel the same way as my partner does , " said Greaves . " As to that , " said Cowperwood , " you need have no fear . I would be perfectly willing to write into any contract we may draw that unless the money for the construction of the first division line is furnished within six months after signing , the agreement is not only canceled , but I agree to pay you  --  zo , 000 by way of damages . Is that satisfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had heard that Cowperwood was shrewd and cold where money was concerned , but they also had heard that he held to his signed contracts . " Well and good ! That sounds reasonable enough . But what about the other divisions ? " This from Greaves.  |p111Cow|perwood  laughed . " Well , gentlemen , I am just disposing of two-thirds of the entire street railway system of Chicago . In the last twenty years in that city I have built thirty-five miles of elevated roads , forty-six miles of electric slot traction lines , and I have built and am now profitably operating seventy-five miles of suburban trolley lines , in all of which I am the majority owner . In connection with these , no investor has ever lost a dime . They have paid , and are paying to this day , more than 6 per cent , and they still belong to me . It is not because they are not profitable that I am disposing of them  --  and at a profit  --  but because of political and social jealousieswhich are irritating to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need the money that I am bothering with this London situation . You must n't forget that it was you who came to me , not I to you . But never mind that . I am not boasting , and do n't wish to . As to these additional sections , the time and the money for each one can be written into the contract , only , as you must know from experience , all must be subject to the natural delays and contingencies which are always likely to affect such things . The principal point is that I am willing now to put up the cash for your option and to do all of the things subsequently that the contract requires . " " What do you say ? " asked Greaves , turning to Henshaw . " I am satisfied that we will do as well with Mr. Cowperwood as with any-one . " " Very well , " said Henshaw , " I 'm ready . " " How do you propose to go about the matter of this transfer ? " asked Cowperwood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your option with the Traffic Electrical Company before you can transfer it to me . " " That 's true , " replied Henshaw , who had already been speculatingas to this . If now they were first to deal directly with the Traffic Electrical Company and subsequently with Cowperwood , it would mean that they not only would have to secure from somewhere the  --  30,000 with which to take up their option , but , in addition , temporarily , at least , would have to borrow  --  6o,000 to effect the transferof the consols which the Traffic Electrical Company had depositedwith the government for performance of their obligation . Since a total of  --  90,000 was not an easy sum to raise , Henshaw bethought himself as to how much better it would be to go to John- son and the office of the Traffic Electrical Company and explain what was under way . He would then ask the directors to meet with Cowperwood , Greaves , and himself , in order that the entire transactioncould be met and disposed of with Cowperwood 's money . And this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it would be best if we made one transaction of the whole thing , " and he explained how , if not why . But Cowperwood understoodwhy , well enough . " Very well , " he said . " If you will arrange with the directors , I am ready . We can complete everything in a few minutes . You can tender your option for my check for  --  30,000 , together with the  --  6o,000 national deposit , or a voucher for it , and I will hand you my check , or checks , for both . All we have to do now , I take it , is to draw up a temporary agreement as to the details of this , and you can sign it . " And he rang for his secretary and dictated the substance of the understanding . " Now , gentlemen , " he said , when it was signed , " I want to feel that we are no longer bargainers , but associates in an important enterprise that should lead to agreeable results for all of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your wholehearted co-operation from now on , you will have mine . " And he gave a most cordial handclasp to both . " Well , " observed Greaves , " I must say , this has been done very quickly . " Cowperwood smiled . " I suppose that is what you would call , in your country , fast . work , ' " added Henshaw . " Nothing more than the exercise of good ' sense on the part of everybody concerned , " said Cowperwood . " If that 's American , fine ! If it 's English , just as fine ! But do n't forget that it took one Americanand two Englishmen to do it ! " As soon as they had left , Cowperwood sent for Sippens . " I do n't know if I can make you believe it or not , De Sota , " he said , when Sippens arrived , " but I have just bought that Charing Cross line for you . " " You did ! " exclaimed Sippens . " Well , that 's great ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new line . And actually at this time Cowperwood was thinking of usingp113him in that way ; long enough , at least , to get things started , only not so much longer , since he looked on Sippens as perhaps too irritatinglyAmerican to be able to deal successfully with men of the world of high finance in London . " Take a look at that ! " he went on , picking up a sheet of paper from his desk , the tentative but nonetheless binding understanding between Greaves and Henshaw and himself . Sippens selected from a box that Cowperwood held out to him a long gold-foil wrapped cigar , and started to read . " Great ! " he snapped , as he concluded his reading , cigar held out at arm 's length . " And if that wo n't make a sensation when they read it in Chicago and New York , and here , too ! Jehoshaphat ! It 'll go all over the world , once you allow it to be announced here . " " But that 's one of the things I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An announcement of this kind , and so soon after my coming here ... well , I 'm a little afraid of the effect of it . . . not back home ... I do n't mind their being surprised or shocked . . . but the effect on the prices of underground rights over here bothers me . They may go up , and most likely will , if this gets out . " He paused . " And particularly when they read of how much money is going to pass over the table at one sitting , and for one little line : relatively  --  roo , 000 . . . for , of course , I have to build that line or lose about  --  7o,000 . " " Right , Chief , " agreed Sippens . " There 's a lot of nonsense to all this , you know , " continued Cowperwood , ruminatively . " Here we are , you and I , both of us getting along in years , and now running around on this new job , which , whether we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either of us . For we 're not going to be here so much longer , De Sota , and neither of us needs the money . " " Just the same , you 're wanting to build it , Chief ! " " I know , " said Cowperwood , " and yet neither of us can do much more than eat a little , drink a little , play about a little while longer , that 's all . What astonishes me is that we can get so excited over it . Are n't you a little astonished at yourself ? " " Well , Chief , I 'm not going to pretend to speak for you , because you 're a great man , and anything you do or do n't do is important . As for me , I look on it all as some sort of a game that I 'm here to play . I used to feel that everything was more important than I feel it is now . Maybe I was right then , for if I had n't gotten busyp114and done a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I would n't have been able to do a lot of things I have done . And I guess that 's the answer : to be doing something all the time . There 's a game on , and whether we like it or not , we have to play our parts . " " Well , " said Cowperwood , " you 'll have plenty to play with pretty soon , if this line is to be built on time . " And he gave his small and vigorous friend a hearty smack on the back . To Berenice , his annnouncement of this Charing Cross control was an occasion for celebration . For was it not she who had originallysuggested this London adventure ? And now here she was at last , finding herself a part of a great world of affairs such as in the past she had only dimly envisioned . Sensing Cowperwood 's exultant mood , she brought out a bottle of wine with which they might toast the occasion , and each other . At one point in their conversation , she could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any chance , met your , our , Lord Stane ? " " Our ' ? " He laughed . " Do n't you really mean your Lord Stane ? " " Mine and yours , " countered Berenice . " For he can help us both , can he not ? " What a creature ! thought Cowperwood . The daring and bravado of this chit of a girl ! " To be sure , " he said , resignedly . " No , I have n't met him , but I admit he is important . In fact , I am hoping he may mean a great deal . However , Stane or no Stane , I shall go ahead with this proj-ect . " " And Stane or no Stane , you will achieve just what you want , " said Berenice . " You know that , and so do I. You do n't need anyone , not even me , " and she came over and took his hand in hers . PLEASED with the thought of the probableeffect of this purchase on his further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call upon Aileen . He had not heard from Tollifer and was seriously wondering what further steps he could take in that direction without committing himself.  |p115A|p|proaching  Aileen 's suite , which adjoined his own , he heard her laugh , and , entering , found her standing before a long mirror , surrounded by a group of saleswomen and fitters from one of the London shops . She was surveying her reflection while her maid adjusted the gown . The room was littered with paper , boxes , tags , and dresses , and he noted that the gown she wore was quite magnificentand in better taste than was customary with her . Two fitters , pins in their mouths , were on their knees making rapid adjustments , while a most attractive and smartly dressed woman was giving them instructions . " Well , well , " remarked Cowperwood as he entered , " this makes me feel a little superfluous , although I would n't mind playing audienceif there 's no objection . " " Come in , Frank ! " called Aileen . " I 'm just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much longer . This is my husband , " she added , addressing the assembled group , who bowed respectfully . " Well , I must say that pale gray is most becoming , " said Cowperwood . " It emphasizes your hair . Few women could wear it as well as you do , my dear . But what I really stopped in for was to say that it looks as though we would be in London for some time . " " Really ? " asked Aileen , turning her head slightly to look at him . " I 've just completed some of that business I was telling you about . It 's all settled except for some minor details . I thought you 'd like to know . " " Oh , Frank , is n't that wonderful ! " She was delighted . " Well , I wo n't take up any more of your time . I have so many things to do . " " By the way , " said Aileen , who sensed his desire to escape and wished to put him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just phoned . He 's back , and is coming to dinner . I explained to him that your business might prevent you from dining with us . I 'm sure he 'll understand . " " It 's a little difficult , " said Cowperwood , " but I 'll do my best to get there "  --  which remark Aileen took for exactly what it was worth : nothing at all . " All right , Frank , " she said , as he waved good-by and left the room . She knew that she would not see him again before the morrow , if then , but one thing caused her to feel this routine indifferencep116of his less keenly . In his telephone conversation with her , Tollifer had apologized for his seeming neglect and had inquired anxiously if she were not coming to France . Aileen was puzzled as to the basis of her attraction for so cavalier a personality . For what reason , exactly , was he so much interested in her ? Money , no doubt . Yet how attractive he was ! Regardless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main reason why Tollifer wished Aileen to come to France  --  though it happened to coincide with Cowperwood 's desire to have her out of London  --  was the fact that he , himself , was one of the most hopeless victims of the charms of Paris . At that time , before the automobile had come into general use , Paris , even more than at a later time , was the holiday center for wealthy Americans , English , Brazilians , Russians , Greeks , and Italians  --  people from every country in the world  --  who came to enjoy themselves , and who made possible the brilliant shops , the charming flower stands , the numerous cafes with their summery outdoor chairs and tables , the gaudy cabarets , the glittering parade in the Bois , the races at Auteil , the gambling , the opera , the theaters , and the underworld . The international hotel , in the form of the Ritz , had arrived . Also the restaurants of the gourmet : the Cafe de la Paix , Voisin 's , Marguery 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poet or artist or romancer without a dime , there was the Quartier Latin . Rains , snows , spring days , autumn days , brilliant sunshine , or gray skies were alike in achieving effects dear to every responsive and creative temperament . Paris sang . And with it sang youth , reminiscentage , ambition , wealth , even defeat and despair . It must not be forgotten that , for the first time in his life , Mr. Tollifer was in funds , and with a glittering playboy program before him . It was so delightful to be able to dress well , have the proper address  --  which for the moment was the Ritz  --  to hurry to the smartestplaces , glancing over the lobbies , pausing at the bars , greeting friends and acquaintances . And in the Bois one Sunday afternoon Tollifer had run into a former flame of his : the onetime Marigold Shoemaker , of Philadelphia , now Mrs. Sidney Brainerd , of the Bar Harbor and Long Island Brainerds . At one time she had been infatuated with him , but because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose money seemed to be inexhaustible . She had a yacht lying off Nice.  |p117The  sight of Tollifer , dressed immaculately and with the mood of adventure dominating him , was sufficient to recall her exciting and romantic debutante days . She hailed him cordially , introduced him to her escort , and gave him her Paris address . Through her , as through others , he saw visions of the opening of at least some of the doors which for so long had been closed against him . There was , however , this business of Aileen . And that was something else again . It was going to require the utmost skill to entertainher while promoting his own interests . He must look about for lesser fry who might be made to appear part and parcel of a better stratum . At once he consulted the various hotel registers for names of actresses , musicians , singers , dancers , whom he knew . Offering assurances of entertainment , he was met with acceptances , and , being thus certain of some immediate diversion for Aileen if she came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canvass of the leading dressmakers , as he considered her present manner of dress far from satisfactory , and believed that with diplomatic advice this could be remedied and at the same time lighten his burden in the matter of presenting her to his friends . One of his most promising Paris contacts came about when a Chicago acquaintance of his introduced him to an Argentinian named Victor Leon Sabinal . This young man , of distinguished lineageand wealth in his own country , had arrived in Paris some years before , with money , letters , and connections that had given him immediate entry into the varied social circles of that cosmopolitan city . Nevertheless , owing to a temperament that pushed him in the direction of extravagance and dissipation , he had exhausted the patienceof his South American parents , who suddenly refused to furnish more money for his escapades . And hence , as in the case of Tollifer , he had been reduced to borrowings and tricks that finally closed the doors of his earlier and more conservative friends . But it was not forgotten by any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely at some future time to change their minds in regard to the punishment of their son . In other words , he might still come into a fortune , and if so , his friends might not be forgotten . This retained for him a circle of lightheartedand variously gifted satellites : artists , soldiers , roues of all nationalities , attractive men and women of the fortune-hunting and pleasure-seeking class . In fact , at this very time , by arrangement with the police and politicians of France , he was being permitted to conductan establishment , attractive , diverting , and convenient , for his many friends , who were actually patrons as well as intimates . Sabinal was tall , slender , dark , almost sinister in his general bearing , partly due to his long , narrow , sallow face and arrestingly high forehead . One of his dark lustrous eyes appeared to be exceedingly round and open , as though it were made of glass , while the other was smaller and narrow , partially concealed by a drooping eyelid . He had a thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lower one . His teeth were even , strong , and gleaming white . His long , thin hands and feet were like his long , thin body : sinuous and taut . But the ensemble was one of cunning , grace , and not too disarming fascination . Altogether he seemed to suggest that anyone crossing his path must be prepared to look out for himself . His place in the Rue Pigalle was never closed . One came to tea and as likely as not remained for breakfast . A part of the extensive third floor , reached by a small elevator , was set off for gambling . A chamber on the second floor contained a small bar , with a most efficient barkeeper from Sabinal 's native land , who , at times , as the necessities compelled , had two , or even three , assistants . The ground floor , in addition to a cloak room , a lounging room , and a kitchen , had a gallery of fine paintings and an interesting library . There was also a well-stocked wine cellar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and informal dinners , and even breakfasts  --  and for no apparent consideration other than minor tips  --  was another Argentinian . On meeting Sabinal , Tollifer at once realized that he was in the presence of a personality of his own persuasion , but of far greater powers , and he gladly accepted an invitation to visit his place . There he encountered an assortment of personalities who interested him very much : bankers and legislators of France , Russian grand dukes , South American millionaires , Greek gamblers , and many others . He sensed immediately that here he could contrive for Aileen such contactsas would not fail to impress her with the thought that she was meeting people of worldly importance . It was this knowledge that made him so gay on his arrival in London . After telephoning to Aileen , he spent the greater part of the day in Bond Street , properly outfitting himself for the summer on the Continent , after which he made his way to Aileen 's hotel.  |p119He  decided that he would make no pretense of affection at this time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who liked her for herself and wished to proffer her , without reward , such social opportunities as she could not otherwise achieve . Following the usual preliminaries of greeting , she began at once with an account of her visit to the estate of Lord Haddonfield . " Haddonfield ... oh , yes . I remember him , " said Tollifer . " He was in the United States some years ago . I believe it was either at Newport or Southampton that I ran into him . Quite a gay fellow . Likes clever people . " The truth was that Tollifer had never met Haddonfield , but knew something of him from hearsay . And immediately he launched into an account of his stay in Paris , and added that here in London he had this day lunched with a certain Lady Lessing , of whose social doings Aileen had read that morning in the newspaper . Delighted by all of this , Tollifer 's interest in her still seemed unaccountable to Aileen . Plainly , it could not be that he expected any social advantage from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get from Frank . She was puzzled , but also certain that little enough would come from Cowperwood as a reward for dancing attendance upon her . He was not like that . In consequence , and in spite of her natural suspicions , she was compelled , even though she hesitated , to entertain the thought that Tollifer was really attracted to her as a person . They dined together at Prince 's that evening , and he entertained her with an intriguing account of the gaieties that might be hers for the asking . He raved about Paris . " Why ca n't you  --  as long as your husband is so busy  --  run over ? " he suggested . " There are so many interesting things to do , to see , to buy . I 've never seen Paris more gay . " " I would like very much to go , " confessed Aileen , " because I really have some shopping to do . But I do n't know whether my husband will be able to go with me or not . " Tollifer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruelly so . " I should think any busy husband might spare his wife a fortnightfor shopping in Paris , " he said . Aileen , now eager to test the resources of this new-found friend , exclaimed : " I 'll tell you what I 'll do ! I 'll ask Frank tomorrow , and let you know . "  |p120Dinner  was followed by a visit to an informal and regular " Tuesdayevening " at the flat of Cecilia Grant , an actress playing in a popular revue , and , incidentally , the mistress of Count Etienne le Bar , a Frenchman of great personal charm and popularity in London . Tollifer knew that a knock at Cecilia 's door would produce a welcome for Aileen and himself . And the group they encountered there  --  including a bizarre countess , the wife of one of the peers of England  --  seemed to Aileen indubitably important and convinced her that whatever Tollifer 's motives , his connections were far more important than hers , or even Cowperwood 's . And at once , although she did not then say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Greaves and Henshaw lostno time in acquainting Johnson with the details of their negotiations with Cowperwood , for Johnson and Stane , and most of the men connected with the Traffic Electrical Company , were also interested in other London underground lines , and their favor was valuable to Greaves and Henshaw as engineers . They were satisfied that technically as well as ethically they were well within their rights , since , in the first instance , the option was theirs to do with as they chose , and , next , they had not actually agreed to Johnson 's direct request that they give him so many days in which to present a repurchase proposition , but had said they would think it over and let him know . They did not know of Jarkins ' visit to Johnson , who was now a bit curious as to what was bringing them to see him . For the first few minutes of their narrative , he was inclined to feel that the best part of the possibilities indicated by a proposed meeting with Cowperwood had evaporated . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan of contact which they suggested . In short , the fact that at one meeting this American was not only ready to pay over  --  30,000 and assume the interest on  --  6o,000 in consols , but also to agree to deposit  --  zo , 000 , no portion of which would ever be returned to him unless he began building within a year , was enough to fascinate him . Probably this matter of the Charing Cross was only a detail , and it was true , as Jarkins had insisted , that Cowperwood was interested mainly in the largerp121phases of underground unification . If so , why not some general scheme which would include himself and Stane before others were taken in ? Plainly , it was still important that he and Stane meet Cowperwood . Well , that could probably be arranged at the meeting in Cowperwood 's office which he would attend in connection with the final negotiations concerning the transfer of the Charing Cross line . Eleven-thirty of the day of the meeting found Cowperwood and Sippens together in Cowperwood 's office , Sippens pacing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ induce his Chief to give ear to . But Cowperwood himself was curiously thoughtful . He had acted so swiftly , he now reflected , more so than was usual with him . And this was an alien land , its ways and moods almost entirely unfamiliar to him . True , it did not follow that because he was buying the rights , he could not sell again . On the other hand , reason as he would , a kind of fatality appeared to be running through the whole affair . For if now , after buying this option , he allowed it to lapse , it would look like a tentative adventure on his part for which he had neither the courage nor the means . But now Jarkins and Kloorfain arrived , fully conscious of their part in this , and having been assured by Cowperwood that his own obligation to them would not be overlooked . And immediately followingthem came Mr. Denton , Sippens ' secretary , and Mr. Ostade , one of Sippens ' investigating committee . Later came Mr. Kitteredge , Sippens ' successor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was there in order to discuss with Cowperwoodsome of his Chicago affairs . Lastly , there was Oliver Bristol , a youthful but exceedingly alert member of Cowperwood 's legal department , who had been sent over to inform himself as to current English procedure . He was now ready for his first task . Cowperwood'sprincipal use for his own people , however , at this time  --  apart from witnessing the transaction  --  was to have them serve as color and background for himself , in order to impress these English gentlemen . At last , and promptly at twelve o'clock , came Messrs . Greaves and Henshaw , accompanied by Johnson , Rider , Calthorpe , and Delafield , of the Traffic Electrical Company ; Mr. Calthorpe being its chairman , Mr. Rider its vice-chairman , and Mr. Johnson its solicitor . And all were not a little impressed as , coming at last into the presence of the great man himself , they found him , sitting behind his desk , attended right and left by his lawyer and all of his assistants . Cowperwood rose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in turn , with the assistance of Jarkins and Sippens , introduced the members of each group . But it was Johnson who held the attention of both Cowperwood and Sippens , Cowperwoodbecause of his connections and Sippens because on sight he sensed a rival . The authoritativeness of the man , the almost august manner in which he cleared his throat and looked around inquiringly , as if he were a scientist examining insects , infuriated Sippens . And it was Johnson who opened the discussion . " Well , Mr. Cowperwood and gentlemen , " he began , " I believe we all fully understand the nature of what is to take place here . Therefore , the sooner we begin , the sooner we will be through . " ( " You do n't say ! " commented Sippens to himself . ) " Yes , I believe that 's a good idea , " said Cowperwood . And pushing a button , he ordered Jamieson to bring in his official checkbook as well as the temporary agreements . Johnson now took from a square leather bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his heels  --  the several books of the Traffic Electrical Company , its official seal , together with the act , and placed all upon Cowperwood 's desk . And Cowperwood , flanked by Bristol and Kitteredge , proceeded to examine them . After checking over various commitments , decisions , expenditures , Greaves produced their option to buy , and the company , through its officers , attested to its validity . Mr. Delafield , as secretary and treasurerof Traffic Electrical Company , produced a copy of the act establishingtheir right to construct the line . Whereupon , a Mr. Blandish , of the London and County Bank , arrived with a certificate of deposit in favor of Frank Algernon Cowperwood for  --  6o,000 in British consols then and there in that bank . These the bank would surrender to him in exchange for his check for that amount . Cowperwood then signed and handed to Messrs . Greaves and Henshaw his check for  --  30,000 , which by then was endorsed to Traffic Electrical Company . The company , through its officers , endorsedto Greaves and Henshaw their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wrote his check for  --  60,000 , and for that took over from the London and County Bankp123its legal acknowledgement of his ownership of the consols . After this , he handed Greaves a duly attested and guaranteed one-year 's non-negotiable agreement . The meeting then closed , with an atmosphereof enthusiasm which was hardly to be explained by the business of the moment . The explanation of this was the personality of Cowperwood and its effect on all those present . Calthorpe , the chairman of Traffic Electrical , for instance , a blond and stocky man of fifty , had come stuffed with prejudice against any American attempting to manage a London railway property . Nevertheless , it was plainly evident that he was impressed by Cowperwood 's dynamic alertness . Rider studied Cowperwood 's clothes , taking note of his beautifully set jade cuff links , his dark tan shoes , and his well-tailored sand-colored suit . Obviously , America was producing a new and distinct type . Here was a man who could , if he wished , become a great force in London 's affairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even an agreeable cunning . The man was ruthless , but in a way which the jumbled interests and oppositions of life required . He was about to leave when Cowperwood came over to him . " From what I hear , Mr. Johnson , you are personally interested in this underground situation , " he said , smiling a cordial smile . " Yes , to some extent , " replied Johnson , civilly , and yet with caution . " My lawyers have informed me , " continued Cowperwood , " that you are more or less of an expert in the traction franchise field here . You see , I have been trained on the other side , and this is all new ground to me . If you have no objection , I would like to talk with you further . Perhaps we could have lunch or dinner together , either at my hotel or some place where we would not be likely to be in-terrupted . " They agreed upon Brown 's Hotel for Tuesday evening of the following week . Alone with Sippens after they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , there you are , De Sota ! We 've just bought a lot more trouble . What do you think of these Englishmen , anyway ? " " Oh , they 're all well enough when they 're dealing with each other , " said Sippens , still irritated by Johnson 's manner , " but you'llp124never see the day when you wo n't have to look out for them , Chief . Your surest support will be the men you yourself have trained . " " I guess you 're right , De Sota , " said Cowperwood , sensing what was in Sippens ' mind . " But I 'm not sure that I wo n't have to include some of these fellows over here , to make everything smooth and right . They ca n't be expected to stand for too many of us all at once . You know that . " " True enough , Chief , but you want enough Americans to keep them from catching you napping ! " But there was revolving in Cowperwood 's mind the thought that what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , men like this Johnson and Greaves and Henshaw , and even that quiet fellow , Rider , who had studied him so carefully but said nothing . In this rapid series of developments , some of these longtimeAmerican connections might lose value . He knew only too well that out of sentiment came nothing that was sufficient in any crisis to warrant its preservation . If life had taught him anything , it had taught him that . And he was not one to turn from his most relentlesslycruel and yet constructive teacher . ALTHOUGH it had been agreed that noinformation of any kind in connection with the transfer of the Charing Cross line was at present to be furnishedto the press , the news somehow leaked out , possibly due to gossip emanating from Rider , Calthorpe , and Delafield . Having been shareholders as well as officers of Traffic Electrical Company before its property was thus transferred , they feared for their future and were inclined to discuss the matter . So that it was not long before financial as well as news reporters appeared , asking Cowperwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that such a transfer was now in process , and that , in due time , a certificate of registration would be filed . Also , that originally he had not come to London to buy anything , seeing that his American interests still required so much of his time , but that certain representatives of London underground ventures had called upon him to urge his managerial as well as financial consideration of routes in which they were interested . Thep125purchase of the Charing Cross had been the result of these overtures , and there were other ventures to which he had promised to give his attention . Whether this would result in a unified system which he would care to build depended on what his coming investigations would reveal . In Chicago , the editorial comments following this announcement were little more than snarls of rage . That such a ruthless trickster , so recently ejected from that city , should proceed to London , and there , by reason of his wealth , cunning , and general effrontery , be able to cajole the powers of that great city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs , was too much ! Plainly , the Britishhad not troubled to inquire into his highly sinister record . But once that was uncovered , as it presently would be , he would be as unwelcome there as he was to this hour and for years past had been in Chicago ! There were equally unfavorable comments in the newspapersof a number of other American cities , the editors and publishersof which had taken their mood from that of Chicago . On the other hand , in the London press , and not strange to relate  --  since its social , financial , and political opinions were highly realisticand never likely to be based on popular complaint  --  the reaction toward Cowperwood was most favorable . The Daily Mail ventured the opinion that such ability as his might not disadvantageously be centered upon the laggard London underground field , which for years had toddled far behind public necessity . The Chronicle deploredthe inactivity of English capital and expressed the pious hope that if an American , in so distant a place as Chicago , could discern what London needed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go forward themselves . There were similar commentsin the Times , Express , and other journals . These comments were , from a financial point of view , as Cowperwoodsaw it , unfortunate . They were likely to concentrate not only English but American financial ambition on his own purpose and awaken obstructive activity , and in this he was certainly not wrong . For no sooner were the notices of the sale of the line confirmed , and his admission as to other offers and his possible future interest in the London transit problem made public , than the chief stockholders of both the District and the Metropolitan , the two lines most impugned , were in a fury of indignation , and in so far as the future was concerned , most certain to oppose him . " Cowperwood ! Cowperwood ! " sniffed Lord Colvay , shareholder and one of the twelve directors of the Metropolitan , as well as of the new City and South London . He was having his breakfast , with the Times to the right of him , for reasons of mental dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mail , his favorite paper . " And who the devil is this Cowperwood ? One of those mushroomAmericans , gadding round the world , telling people what to do ! I wonder who his so-called advisers are  --  Scarr , maybe , with that Baker Street and Waterloo scheme of his , and Wyndham Willets , with his Deptford and Bromley route . And , of course , Greaves and Henshaw , looking for contracts . And the Traffic Electrical anxious to clear out . " Equally annoyed was Sir Hudspeth Dighton , director of the Districtand a shareholder in the Metropolitan . He was already seventyfiveyears of age , ultraconservative and not at all interested to enter upon radical railway changes , particularly when they represented large expenditures , the profit outcome of which could not definitely be foretold . He had arisen at five-thirty , and after having his tea and reading his paper , was walking among the flowers on his estate at Brentford , pondering the problem of these Americans , with their newfangled notions about everything . To be sure , the undergrounds were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be modernized to advantage . But why should the Times and the Mail be pointing out the fact , and particularly in connection with the arrival of an American who certainly could do no better than any of a score of Englishmen when put to it ? It was no more and no less than belittling British ability , which was nonsense . England ruled , and would continue to rule , the world . It certainly needed no outsidehelp . And from that moment on , he was prepared to argue against any foreign interference in connection with the development of London underground transit . So , too , with Sir Wilmington Jeems , whose residence was in the region of Wimbley Park . He was also a director of the District . He was willing to admit that modernization and extension were desirable . But why an American ? When the proper time came , that could be arranged by Englishmen . And something related to the opinions of these three men constitutedthe majority reaction of the directors and largest shareholders of both the Metropolitan and the District , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London.  |p127But  it was Colvay , the most aggressive and dynamic of the three , who was finally roused to defensive action . That same day he proceeded to consult the other directors , Stane first of all , as to what action should be taken in the matter . But by then Stane had been sufficiently impressed by Johnson 's account of Cowperwood , and what he had read in the papers , to answer Colvay very cautiously . He stated that this proposal of Cowperwood 's was a natural development . It was something which anyone apart from the older directors of both companies could see as necessary . Certainly , the obvious thing , now that a rival system was proposed , was to call a meeting of the directors of the Metropolitan and the District , and both groups should confer as to a proper course . Colvay next called on Sir Wilmington Jeems , and found him in a perturbed frame of mind . " It 's a hundred to one , Colvay , " he said , " if we and the Metropolitan do n't join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough shareholders in both companies to do us all in . Count on me for unity against Cowperwood , as long as our individual interests are fully protected . " With this encouragement , Colvay proceeded to call up as many of the directors as he could reach . Out of twelve , he found seven who were alive to the import of what he had to say . Accordingly , special directors ' meetings in both companies were scheduled for the followingFriday , and at these meetings a request for a joint conference between the directors of the two companies was voted for the followingThursday , when there would be consideration of this new issue . Stane and Johnson went into conference on this sudden development . It was very interesting , and most opportune , in view of the forthcoming dinner engagement between Johnson and Cowperwood . " Depend on it ! " said Johnson , " he knows everything about us through that fellow Jarkins , and he wants to sound us out . " " Well , two pins to a steam engine , " said Stane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless Cowperwood does something first . Just now , they are considerably stirred up , but our people are not likely to agree on any radical changes . They can not bring themselves , even now , to unite the two loop lines , let alone electrify them and operate them as a unit . Unless Cowperwood goes ahead with his program , they will do nothing . My feeling is that wep128should play with him up to the point where we see just how comprehensivehis plan is , and whether he is certain to go through with it . Then we can decide what it is going to mean to us . Unless it is perfectly clear that the Metropolitan  --  District people are willing and ready to do as well or better , I feel we should join with Cowperwood and compromise with our old friends later . " " Quite sound , quite sound ! " interjected Johnson at this point . " I 'm with you entirely as to that . At least , in theory . But do n't forget , my position in this matter is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines , I feel with you that very little is to be expected from those who are in charge of things now . But as a solicitor for both lines , I have to consider how my activities in this dual capacity are likely to turn out . As you can see for yourself , I can not operate on both sides at once . My duty , as well as my sincere desire , is to study the matter thoroughly without taking sides , and to see if the English and American interests can not be harmonized . As solicitor , it seems to me there could be no harm in my confessing that I have been approached by Mr. Cowperwood as to their general attitude . And as a shareholder in these companies , I should be able to decide for myself which is the best program , and , privately , at least , act accordingly . You do n't see any moral objection to that , do you ? " " None whatever , " said Stane . " It seems to me a very fair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they object , all right . That should n't bother us . And , of course , Mr. Cowperwood will take care of him-self . " " Well , I certainly am glad to hear you say that , " commented Johnson . " I was beginning to be a little troubled , but now I think it may work out . At least , there will be no harm in my having this consultationwith Cowperwood . And then , if it looks satisfactory to you , perhaps we can go further . That is , the three of us , " he added cautiously . " Certainly , the three of us , " replied Stane . " Whenever you have anything definite to report , let me know . At least , we can say one thing , " he added , getting up and stretching his long legs , " we have stirred up the animals a bit . Or , at any rate , Cowperwood has done it for us . And all we have to do is to sit tight and see which way they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Johnson . " I 'll get in touch with you immediately after I see Cowperwood on Tuesday . "  | THE dinner at Brown 's Hotel was fatefulnot only for Johnson and all he represented , but for Cowperwood and all that he desired to achieve , although neither of them fully realized this at the time . As Cowperwood soon learned , Johnson had been deeply impressed by what had just occurred in connection with the directors and investorsof the underground interests , and was , for all his previous enthusiasm , seeking to tread a middle course until he should learn exactly what Cowperwood was going to propose . Nevertheless , he was satisfied that Johnson , because of the great stake of future profits in connection with the development of the London transit field , was anxious to side with him if possible . And because of his own desire for social as well as financial rehabilitation , he was determined to make this possible . He began by asking Johnson to tell him quite frankly the difficulties which would confront any foreigner who approachedthis situation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decidedly frank inquiry , Johnson outlined the situationjust as frankly . In fact , he talked to Cowperwood as he had talked to Stane about his personal position , making it perfectly clear that he believed his employers to be stubborn , and even obtuse , in failing to take account of the great social and economic changes which were slowly but surely developing here . Until this hour , he admitted , there had been no common sense realization of what must be done . And the present interest was due to jealousy of a foreigner rather than to any intelligent desire to solve the problem on its merits . He was sorry to say so , but it was the truth . And however much he might agree with Cowperwood in his desire to do the wise things , if he personally , as solicitor for the Metropolitan and District lines , were suspected of furthering any outside plan of interference , and regardless of his interest as a shareholder , he would be turned on and divested of his present important connections , shorn of his power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult . Nevertheless , Johnson insisted , the invasion was legitimate , and , from a purely practical point of view , should be carried through . And for that reason he was anxious to help , if possible . But he must know the exact details of Cowperwood 's program , in order that they might see how far they could go together.  | Cowperwood 's private plan was , in reality , much more subtle and ruthless than Johnson was ready at the moment to suspect . For one thing , having contemplated the prestige and advantage which this single purchase of the Charing Cross rights had brought him , and considering the various other rights which had already been sanctionedby Parliament  --  but quite all of which appeared to lack the money with which to proceed  --  he was thinking of buying as many as possible of these for himself , and without a word to anyone . And later , if he were fought too stubbornly , he would combine them and offer London a rival system  --  a move which he felt would bring his enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Charing Cross line , which was nothing more than a continuation of the old Traffic Electrical Company , he was prepared , if necessary , to share a fair percentage of its founder 's shares with such English investors as could help him get control of the District line . While Cowperwood had indicated to Berenice that it was his intention to place this London venture on a higher plane than any other he had ever engaged in , nevertheless , experience had taught him the necessity of keeping the major profits in his own hands until such time as he was sure that he would not to be overreached in such a way as to make absolute honesty on his part ridiculous and destructive . It had been a principle with him to own and control not only at least 51 per cent of every company of which he was the head , but also at least 51 per cent of the various minor companies which he invariably organized and operated through dummies . Thus , in regard to the electrical equipment required by the new line , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Construction Company to take over the contract for electrifying the Charing Cross line . Other subsidiary companies would be organized to supply cars , rails , steel girders , station equipment , and the like . Naturally , the profits would be enormous . Althoughin Chicago , these had gone to himself alone , here in London , in order to win a battle which threatened to be difficult , he was now planning to divide a percentage of these profits with those who would be most useful to him . For instance , it was his intention , if necessary , to acquaint Stale and Johnson with this equipment company plan , and if they were truly harmonious , to show them how , in case he , or he an . they jointly , should come into possession of the Metropolitan and thep131District , their earliest and surest profits would come from this business of construction and equipment . Furthermore , he intended to emphasize that with the building and equipment of each additional extension of this general system , the profits from this equipment and construction company would go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience , he knew to be immense . Cowperwood 's bearing before Johnson in this friendly conference was that of one who had nothing whatever to conceal . At the same time , he was thinking it would not be easy to outwit such a man . In fact , he was the sort of person who might be a good replacement for Sippens , if it were ever possible to arrange it . In consequence , after sounding out Johnson as to his various potentialities and finding him receptive , though reserved , he asked him whether he would be willingto act as chief counsel and fiscal agent in connection with the very necessary series of overtures which would precede the uniting of all of the lines and rights necessary for a complete London tube system . As he now assured Johnson , his purchase of the Charing Cross line was not really significant or important save as it could be used as an entering wedge for other lines . " The truth is , Mr. Johnson , " he went on , in his most effective manner , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigated . And I know as well as you do that this central loop system is the key to the entire business . I also know that you and Lord Stane are among the largest minority stockholders of the District . Now I want to know if there is not some way through you that I can effect a combination with the Metropolitan and the Districtas well as the other lines . " " It 's not going to be easy , " said Johnson , solemnly . " We are confronted by tradition , and England stands by her own . However , if I understand you , you are aiming to bring about a combination betweenyourself and these lines , particularly the loop system , with yourself in charge , of course . " " Precisely , " said Cowperwood , " and I can make it worth your while , I assure you . " " You do not need to tell me that , " said Johnson . " But I shall have to take some time to think about this , Mr. Cowperwood , do a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it all out , we can go over the whole matter again . " " Of course , " said Cowperwood . " I understand that . Besides , Ip132want to leave London for a little while . Suppose you call me within the next ten or twelve days . " They then shook hands warmly , Johnson thrilled by a dream of activity and possession . It was a little late for him to be triumphing in this field , to which his entire life had been devoted . Yet it now seemed possible . As for Cowperwood , he was left to meditate upon the practical financial course which he must pursue . In the last analysis , the open sesame to the solution of this problem was simple : to offer enough in pounds sterling . Dangle enough cash before the eyes of the quarrelinginvestors , and , whatever their objections , it was more than likely that they would take the cash and let the quarrel go . Supposinghe did have to pay these recalcitrant directors and investors two or three or four pounds for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his construction corporation plan and the growth of traffic itself in a great and growing city like London would actually cover not only the extraordinary price which he was now prepared to offer , but eventually would yield more in interest than these people had the wit to envision . The thing to do was to secure control , and then later unite these lines , at whatever seemingly fabulous cost . Time , and the current financial growth of the world , would take care of it all . Of course , since he did not wish to reach down into his own hoardings for the preliminary cost of all this , he would probably have to return to the United States in the near future , and , by cannily outlining the possibilities of the situation , secure from certain banks , trust companies , and individual financiers with whose methods and cupidity he was thoroughly acquainted , subscriptions to an underlyingholding company . And this in turn would take over these London properties and then later prorate these acquired holdings to the various subscribers on a basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the thing to do now was to refresh himself by a vacation with Berenice . When that was over , he would consult with Johnson and arrange for a meeting with Lord Stane , for upon the attitude of these two , much depended.  | THROUGHOUT this turmoil of businessaffairs  --  which had been punctuated by the departure of Aileen for Paris and Berenice 's activities in connection with Pryor 's Cove  --  Cowperwood had had to content himself with mere glimpses of his loved one . She was so busy , apparently , shopping and arranging things . The graceful trivialities with which she amused herself , however , only served to make her more of an intriguing personality in his eyes . She is so alive , he often said to himself . She desires things and enjoys them intensely , and makes me do so . She appears to be interested in everything , and therefore people are naturally interested in her . And now , on his first visit to Pryor 's Cove , he found the place completely equipped : cook , maids , housekeeper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stane . And Berenice herself affecting an interest  --  or pose , he could not say which  --  in regard to the charms of this rustic life . So often her love of nature appeared to be genuine , and even affecting : a bird , a tree , a flower , a butterfly  --  she was ecstatic . Marie Antoinette could have played the part no better . When he arrived , she was out with the shepherd , who had assembled the sheep and lambs for her inspection . As his carriage rolled into the drive , she gathered into her arms one of the smallest and wooliest of the new lambs . She made a picture which delighted but in no way deceived him . Acting , and for my benefit , was his thought . " The shepherdess and her sheep ! " he exclaimed , stepping forward and touching the head of the lamb in her arms . " These charming creatures ! They come and go like the spring flowers . " His glance acknowledged the artistry of her dress , although he said nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusual costume was natural . She would pretend to be unconscious of the significance of her poses , considering them natural to herself , a privilegeas well as an obligation that was a part of her physical gifts . " You should have come a little earlier , " she said . " You might have met our neighbor , Arthur Tavistock . He 's been helping me arrange things . He had to go to London , but he 's coming tomorrow to do some more work . "  | " Really ! What a practical chatelaine ! Employing her guests ! Is this a place where work is to be the chief form of entertainment ? What am Ito do ? " " Run errands . And lots of them , too . " " But I began life that way . " " Be careful that you do n't end it that way . " She took his arm . " Come along with me , dear . Here , Dobson ! " she called to the shepherd , who came forward and took the lamb from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the houseboat . There , on the awninged veranda , a table was spread . Inside , at one of the boat 's open windows , Mrs. Carter was reading . After Cowperwoodhad greeted her cordially , Berenice led him over to the table . " Now , you 're to sit here and contemplate nature , " she ordered . " Just relax and forget all about London . " Then she put before him his favorite drink , a mint julep . " There ! Now let me tell you some of the things I have in mind that we could do , if you 're going to have any time . Are you ? " " All the time in the world , sweet , " he said . " I 've arranged things . We are free . Aileen has gone to Paris , " he added confidentially , " and from what she said , I do n't expect her back under ten days . Now , what 's on your mind ? " " A tour of some of the English cathedrals for mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I have always wanted to see Canterbury and York and Wells . Do n't you think we might take the time to do that , since we ca n't very well go to the Continent ? " " I think it would be ideal . I have never seen much of England , and it will be a treat for me . We can be alone . " He took her hand in his , while she touched his hair with her lips . " Do n't think I 'm not keeping up with all this noise about you in the papers , " she said . " Already , the fact that the great Cowperwood is my guardian has gotten around . My furniture mover wanted to know if my guardian and the American millionaire talked of in the Chronicle were the same person . I had to admit it . But Arthur Tavistock seems to think it natural enough for me to have so distinguisheda mentor . " Cowperwood smiled . " I suppose you 've considered the servants and what they are likely to think . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but necessary . That is thep135reason I want us to take the trip . Now , if you 're rested I want to show you something interesting . " And she smiled as she signaled Cowperwood to follow her . She led the way to a bedroom which was beyond the central hall , opened a bureau drawer and extracted from it a pair of hairbrushes , with the coat of arms of the Earl of Stane engraved on the silver backs ; also a stray collar button , and several hairpins . " If hairpins could be identified as easily as hairbrushes , these things might prove a romance , " she said , mischievously . " But the noble lord 's secret is going to be kept by me . " At that moment , from under the trees surrounding the cottage , came the sound of a sheep bell . " There ! " she exclaimed , as it ceased . " When you hear that , whereveryou are , you 're to come to dinner . It 's going to take the place of a bowing butler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to start south from London , with perhaps a stop at Rochester , and then on to Canterbury . After paying homage to that exquisite poem in stone , they were to motor to some modest streamside inn on the river Stour  --  no great hotel or resort to break the aesthetic simplicity of this tour  --  where they would enjoy a room with a fire and the simplest of English fare . For Berenice had been reading Chaucer and books on these English cathedrals , and she hoped to recapture the spirit in which they were conceived . From Canterbury they would go to Winchester , and from there to Salisbury , and from Salisbury to Stonehenge ; from thence to Wells , Glastonbury , Bath , Oxford , Peterborough , York , Cambridge , and then home again . But always , as she insisted , the purely conventional was to be avoided . They were to seek the smallest of inns and the simplest of villages . " It will be good for us , " she insisted . " We pamper ourselves too much . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better subways . " " And you ought to be content with simple cotton dresses ! " said Cowperwood . For Cowperwood , the real charm of their vacation trip was not the cathedrals or the village cottages and inns . It was the changeful vividness of Berenice 's temperament and tastes that held him . There was not a single woman of his acquaintance who , given a choice of Paris and the Continent in early May , would have selected the cathedraltowns of England . But Berenice was apart from others in that she seemed to find within herself the pleasures and fulfillments which she most craved . At Rochester , they listened to a guide who talked of King John , William Rufus , Simon de Montfort , and Watt Tyler , all of whom Cowperwood dismissed as mere shadows , men or creatures who had once had their day and selfish notions of one kind or another and had moved on to pass into nothing , as would all who were here . He liked better the sunlight on the river and the sense of spring in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the somewhat commonplace view . But at Canterbury the mood of all changed greatly , even that of Mrs. Carter , who was by no means interested in religious architecture . " Well , now , I like this place , " she commented , as they entered one of its winding streets . " I want to find out by which road the pilgrims came , " said Berenice . " I wonder if it was this one . Oh , look , there 's the cathedral ! " and she pointed to a tower and spandril visible above the low roof of a stone cottage . " Lovely ! " commented Cowperwood . " And a delightful afternoon for it , too . Do we have lunch first , or feast on the cathedral instead ? " " The cathedral first ! " replied Berenice . " And eat a cold lunch afterwards , I suppose , " put in her mother , sarcastically . " Mother ! " chided Berenice . " And at Canterbury , of all places ! " " Well , I happen to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important it is not to be last if we ca n't be the first , " said Mrs. Carter . " And there you have the power of religion in 19oo ! " remarked Cowperwood . " It must wait on a country inn . " " I have n't a word to say against religion , " persisted Mrs. Carter , " but churches are different . They have n't a thing to do with it . " Canterbury . The tenth-century close , with its rabble of winding streets , and within its walls , silence and the stately , time-blackened spires , pinnacles , and buttresses of the cathedral itself . Jackdaws flutteringand quarreling over the vantage points . Within , a welter of tombs , altars , tablets , shrines : Henry IV , Thomas a Becket , ArchbishopLaud , the Huguenots , and Edward , the Black Prince . Bere/nice could scarcely be drawn away . Guides and flocks of sightseers were slowly parading from memory to memory . In the crypt where the Huguenots lived and found shelter , worshiped and wove their clothes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , too , at the spot where Thomas a Becket was killed . Cowperwood , who saw things in the large , could scarcely endure this minutae . He was but little interested in the affairs of bygone men and women , being so intensely engaged with the living present . And after a time he slipped outside , preferring the wide sweep of gardens , with their flower-lined walks and views of the cathedral . Its arches and towers and stained-glass windows , this whole carefully executed shrine , still held glamor , but all because of the hands and brains , aspirations and dreams of selfish and self-preserving creatures like himself . And so many of these , as he now mused , walking about , had warred over possession of this church . And now they were within its walls , graced and made respectable , the noble dead ! Was any man noble ? Had there ever been such a thing as an indubitablynoble soul ? He was scarcely prepared to believe it . Men killed to live  --  all of them  --  and wallowed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wars , vanities , pretenses , cruelties , greeds , lusts , murder , spelled their true history , with only the weak running to a mythical saviour or god for aid . And the strong using this belief in a god to further the conquest of the weak . And by such temples or shrines as this . He looked , meditated , and was somehow touched with the futility of so much that . was still so beautiful . But occasional glimpses of Berenice , poised attentively over a cross or religious inscription , were sufficient to restore him . There was about her at such moments a seemingly non-material as well as mentallycontemplative grace which brushed aside the tang of that pagan modernity which at other times gave her the force and glare of a red flower in a gray rock . Perhaps , as he now reasoned with himself , her reaction to these faded memories and forms , joined , as it was , with her delight in luxury , was not unakin to his own personal delight in paintings and his pleasure in power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the more so when , the pilgrimage over , they were finally preparing to leave for dinner , she exclaimed : " We 're coming back here this evening after dinner ! There will be a new moon . " " Indeed ! " said Cowperwood , amusedly . Mrs. Carter yawned and announced that she would not return . She was going to her room after dinner.  | " Very well , Mother , " said Berenice , " but Frank must come back for the good of his soul ! " " There you are ! I have a soul ! " said Cowperwood , indulgently . So later , after a simple meal at the inn , Berenice led him down the darkening street . As they entered the carved black gate that led into the close , the moon , a new white feather in a roof of blue-black steel , seemed but an ornament of the topmost pinnacle of the long silhouetteof the cathedral . At first , engaged by the temperamental whim of Berenice , Cowperwood stared dutifully . But presently , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , to be young , to be so thrilled , to be so deeply moved by color , form , the mystery and meaninglessness of human activity ! But Berenice was not thinking only of the faded memories and jumble of hopes and fears that had produced all this , but also of the mystery and immensity of voiceless time and space . Ah , to have understanding , knowledge ! To think earnestly and seekingly for some reason or excuse for life ! Was her own life merely to be one of clever , calculating , and ruthless determination to fulfill herself socially , or as an individual ? What benefit could that be , to her or to anyone ? What beauty would that create or inspire ? Now .. . here . . . in this place . . . perfumed with memories and moonlight ... something was at her elbow and in her heart . . . something that whispered of quiet and peace . . . solitude . . . fulfillment .. . a desire to create something utterly beautiful , so that her life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was wild dreaming . . . the moon had bewitched her . Why should she want anything ? She had all that women desired . " Let 's go back , Frank , " she said , at last , something within herself failing her , some sense of beauty gone forever . " Let 's go back to the inn . WHILE Cowperwood and Berenice weretouring the cathedral towns , Aileen and Tollifer were visiting the Paris cafes , smart shops , and popular resorts . Having made sure that Aileen was coming , Tollifer had precededher by twenty-four hours , and used that time to arrange ap139program which should prove amusing and so detain her in Paris . For he knew that this French world was not a novelty to her . She had been there , and in most of the European resorts , at numerous times in the past , when Cowperwood was most anxious to see her happy . Even now these were precious memories , and occasionally flashed only too vividly before her . Nonetheless , she was finding Tollifer a most diverting person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ritz , where she had installedherself with her maid , half-wondering why she had come . It was true that she had intended to go to Paris , but she had treasuredthe idea that Cowperwood would go with her . However , his affairs in London , shouted about by the press and glibly enough presented to her by himself , convinced her that his time was very much occupied . In fact , having encountered Sippens in the lobby of the Cecil one morning , he had regaled her with a brisk and colorful account of the tangle of affairs with which Cowperwood was now burdened . " He 'll turn this town upside down , Mrs. Cowperwood , " Sippens had said , " if his interest holds out . I just hope he does n't work too hard "  --  which was really not at all what he hoped . " He 's not as young as he used to be , although he seems shrewder and quicker than ever . " " I know , I know , " Aileen had replied at the time . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . He 'll keep on working until he dies , I suppose . " And she had left Sippens , feeling that this was true , yet suspecting , that there must be a woman somewhere . . . possibly Berenice Fleming . However , she was Mrs. Frank Cowperwood . She had the consolation of knowing that wherever her name was mentioned , people would turn and look : in the shops , hotels , restaurants . And then there was this Bruce Tollifer . Here he was , on her arrival , as handsome as ever , and saying , as he entered her hotel suite : " Well , you did take my advice ! And now that you 're here , I 'm going to make myself responsible for you . If you 're in the mood , you must dress immediately for dinner . I 've arranged a little party for you . Some friends of mine from home are here . I do n't know whether you know the Sidney Brainerds , of New York ? " " Oh , yes , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew by hearsay that the Brainerds were wealthy and socially significant.  | Mrs. Brainerd , as she remembered , had been Marigold Shoemaker , of Philadelphia . " Mrs. Brainerd is here in Paris , " continued Tollifer . " She and several of her friends are coming on to dinner with us at Maxim 's , and afterward we 're going to an Argentinian 's place . He 'll amuse you , I know . Do you think you can be ready in an hour ? " He turned toward the door with the air of one who was anticipating a very gay evening . " Oh , I think so , " said Aileen , laughing . " But you 'll have to leave now if I 'm to start . " " That fits in perfectly for me . Wear white , if you have it , and dark red roses . You 'll look stunning ! " Aileen flushed a little at this familiarity . A high-handed caballero , to say the least ! " I 'll wear just that , " she said , giving him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress . " " Great ! I 'll be back for you in an hour . Until then . . . " and he bowed and left . As she dressed , she found herself more than ever at a loss to understand this sudden , assured invasion of Tollifer 's . It was obvious he was not without money . Yet , with these superior connections of his , why should he bother with her ? Why should this Mrs. Brainerd join a dinner party of which she was not to be the principal guest ? Pursued as she was by contradictory thoughts , this easy friendship of Tollifer , pretense though it might be , was still fascinating . If he were an adventurer , coldly seeking money , like so many , most certainly he was a clever one . And with diversions at his beck and call , such as all those who had approached her in the past few years had lacked . Their methods had all too often been dull , their manners irritating . " Ready ? " exclaimed Tollifer breezily as he came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the red roses at her waist . " We 'll be just in time if we go now . Mrs. Brainerd is bringing a young Greek banker , and her friend , Mrs. Judith Thorne , no acquaintance of mine , is bringing an Arab sheik , Ibrihim Abbas Bey , who is up to God knows what here in Paris ! But , anyway , he speaks English , and so does the Greek . " Tollifer was a little flushed and , if anything , even more assured . He paced the room with an easy stride , drunkenly elevated by the knowledge that he was once more in good form . To Aileen 's amusementhe railed against the furnishings of her suite.  | " Look at those hangings ! God , what they get away with ! As I came up in the elevator just now , it squeaked . Imagine that in New York ! And it 's just such people as you who let them do it ! " Aileen was flattered . " Is it so bad ? " she asked . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where else can we go here ? " He poked his finger at the tasseled silk shade of a floor lamp . " This has a wine stain on it . And somebody 's been burning this fake tapestry with cigarettes . I do n't blame them ! " Aileen laughed at him , amused by his swaggering maleness . " Oh , come on , " she said , " we could be in worse places than this . Besides , you 're keeping your guests waiting . " " That 's right . I wonder if that sheik knows anything about Americanwhiskey . Let 's go find out ! " Maxim 's of 1900 . Glossily waxed black floors , reflecting Pompeian red walls , a gilded ceiling , and the lights of three enormous prismed electroliers . Except for front and rear exits , the walls lined with russet-red leather seats , and before them small and intimate supper tables : a Gallic atmosphere calculated to effect that mental as well as emotional release which the world of that day sought in one place , and one place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a happy delirium . Types and costumes and varying temperaments of all the nations of the world . And all at the topmost toss of wealth , title , position , fame , and all tethered by the steel cords of convention in conduct and dress , yet all , seeking freedom from convention , drawn to convention 's showplace of unconventionality . Aileen was gloriously thrilled to see and be seen here . As Tollifer rather anticipated , his friends were late . " The sheik , " he explained , " sometimes goes astray . " But a few minutes later came Mrs. Brainerd and her Greek , and Mrs. Thorne with her Arab cavalier . The sheik in particular caused a slight stir and buzz . At once , in his grandest manner , Tollifer took over the business of ordering , delighting in the half-dozen waiters who hovered like flies about the table . The sheik , he was delighted to discover , was instantly attracted to Aileen . Her rounded form , her bright hair and high coloring suggested more delight to him than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Thorne . At once he devoted himself to her , bombarding her with polite inquiries . From where did she come ? Was her husband , likep142all these Americans , a millionaire ? Might he have one of her roses ? He liked their dark color . Had she ever been to Arabia ? She would enjoy the life of a roving Bedouin tribe . It was very beautiful in Arabia . Aileen , fixed by his blazing black eyes above his smartly clipped beard , his long hooked nose and swarthy complexion , was at once thrilled and dubious . What would intimate contact with this man be like ? Suppose one went to Arabia  --  what would become of one in the clutches of such a creature ? Although she smiled and gave all the required information , she was pleased to feel that Tollifer and his friends were near at hand , even though their amused attention was not exactly to her liking . Ibrihim , learning that she was to be in Paris for a few days , asked to be allowed to see more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prix . She must go with him to see the horse . Later , they would dine together . She was at the Ritz ? Ah . . . he was occupyingan apartment in the Rue Said , near the Bois . During this scene , Tollifer , in high spirits , was doing his best to ingratiate himself with Marigold , who twitted him as to this latest affair of his , the nature of which she quite well understood . " Tell me , Bruce , " she teased , at one point , " what are you going to do with all the rest of us , now that you are so amply provided for ? " " If you mean yourself , you can tell me that . I have n't so many bothering me . " " No ? Is the poor darling as lonely as that ? " " Just as lonely as that , and more so , if you only knew , " he said , soberly . " But what about your husband ? Is n't he likely to resent interference ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , smilingly and encouragingly . " I just ran into him before I met you . Besides , how many years has it been since I last saw you ? " " Oh , quite a few . But whose fault is that ? And what about your yacht ? " " Only my regular skipper , I swear ! How would you like to take a cruise ? " Tollifer was nonplussed . Here was one of those opportunities of which he had been dreaming . And obviously now he could not take advantage of it . He must go on with what he had agreed to do , or there would be an end to all this.  | " Well , " he said , laughingly , " you 're not sailing tomorrow ? " " Oh , no ! " " If you 're serious , be careful ! " " Never more serious in my life , " she replied . " That remains to be seen . Anyway , will you have luncheon with me one day this week ? We 'll walk in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill and they left . Sabinal 's . Midnight . The customary swarm of people . Gambling . Dancing . Intimate groups in brisk or lazy conversation . Sabinal himselfcoming forward to greet Tollifer and his party , and suggesting they adjourn to his apartment until one o'clock , when a popular troupe of Russian singers and dancers would perform . Sabinal was the possessor of notable jewels , medieval Italian glass and silver , Asiatic fabrics of rare texture and color , but even more impressive than his collection  --  which he exhibited in the most casual manner  --  was his own elusive and Mephistophelean self , a shadowy and yet intriguing force which affected all as might an opiate . He knew so many people , and such interesting places . In the fall , he was planning a trip , he said ; closing up his place for a while . He was off to the Orient to collect fine objects which later he would sell to private collectors . Indeed , his income from this sort of quest was considerable . Aileen , as well as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . All the more so because Tollifer was careful not to explain to any of them the commercial basis on which it was conducted . He intended sending his personal check to Sabinal , but preferredthem to take away the impression that Sabinal was a friend of his . THE importance of Tollifer 's job wasimpressed on him by the receipt , on the third day after Aileen 's arrival , of an additional $2,000 in cash from the Paris fiscal agent of the Central Trust of New York , which , before his leaving , had notified him to keep their London and Paris offices advised of his address . There was no doubt of Aileen 's compliant mood in regard to him.  | Telephoning her some five hours after their visit to Sabinal 's , and suggesting they have lunch together , he could tell from the tone of her voice that she was glad to hear from him again . It was the feeling of companionship with someone who seemed to take a personal interest in her that made her happy . In some respects , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not a little managerial . He left the telephone whistling . His attitude toward her was more kindly than it had been when he first considered the task . For in studying her so far , he was fully able to grasp what the favor and affection of Cowperwood must have meant to her , and what its completeloss must spell to her now . Often moody himself , and for not dissimilar reasons , he could sympathize with her . The night before , at Sabinal 's , when Marigold and Mrs. Thorne had at times so casually and indifferently excluded her from their conversation , he had noticed a neglected and helpless look on her face . It had moved him to take her away from the group for a few minutes ' play at the roulette wheel . Unquestionably , she was going to prove a difficult protegee . But that was his job , and on the success of it rested his future . But , my God , he said to himself : she ought to take off at least twenty pounds ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's too tame . She needs to be made to respect herself , and then these other people will respect her . If I ca n't do that for her , she 'll do me more harm than good , money or no money ! Always the industrious struggler for what he wanted , he decided upon immediate and intensive action . Conscious that inspiration for Aileen depended upon his own smart appearance , he took the utmost pains to look his best . He smiled as he contrasted himself with the figure he had cut in New York six months before . Rosalie Harrigan , that wretched room , his disappointing efforts to get a job ! His apartment in the Bois was but a few moments ' walk from the Ritz , and he stepped forth this morning with the air of a Parisian favorite . He thought of the various dressmakers , hairdressers , milliners , he would enlist in the making-over of Aileen . Around the cornerwas Claudel Richard . He would take her to Richard , and persuade him to impress upon her that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her that would arrest atten/tion and that she should be among the first to wear . Then there was Kraussmeier , in the Boulevard Haussmann . His footwear was rumoredto excel that of all other bootmakers . Tollifer had satisfied himself as to that . In the Rue de la Paix , what ornaments , perfumes , jewels ! In the Rue Dupont , what salons de beaute , with Sarah Schimmel 's as the favored establishment in this particular field . Aileen should learn of her . At Natasha Lubovsky 's balcony restaurant overlooking the park across from Notre Dame , lingering over iced coffee and eggs Sudanoff , he lectured Aileen on current modes and tastes . Had she heard that Teresa Bianca , the Spanish dancing sensation , was wearingKraussmeier slippers ? And Francesca , the youngest daughter of the Duke of Toiler , was one of his patronesses . And had she heard of the marvels of beautifying accomplished by Sarah Schimmel ? He recited a dozen instances . Followed a visit to Richard 's , then to Kraussmeier 's , and a certain Luti , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with tea at Germay 's . And at nine in the evening , at the Cafe de Paris , there was a dinner , at which appeared Rhoda Thayer , of American light-opera fame , and her summer companion , the BrazilianMello Barrios , undersecretary of the Brazilian Embassy . Also a guest was a certain Maria Rerstadt , of Czech and Hungarian extraction . On one of his earlier visits to Paris , Tollifer had met her as the wife of one of the Austria 's secret military representatives in France . Lunching in Marguery 's one day recently , he had met her again , in company with Santos Castro , a baritone of the French opera , who was singing opposite the new American opera star , Mary Garden . He learned her husband had died , and noted she seemed a little bored with Castro . If Tollifer were free , she would be glad to see him again . And since her mood as well as her natural intelligence and suave maturity seemed better suited to Aileen than some of the younger women he knew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on presentation , Aileen was strongly impressed by her . She was a woman of arresting appearance : tall , with smooth black hair and strange gray eyes , and this evening dressed in what appeared to be a single length of ruby velvet , draped seductively around her . In sharp contrast to Aileen , she wore no jewels , and her hair was drawn back smoothly from her face . Her attitude toward Castro suggested that he meant little to her , except maybe the publicity which contact with him might bring her . Turning to Aileen and Tollifer , she proceeded to relate that only recently she and Castro had made a tour of the Balkans , an admission  --  and coming so soon after Tollifer 's explanation to Aileen that the two were merely good friends  --  which somewhat startled Aileen , since always , and regardless of her personaland private transgressions , she was a little overawed by convention . Yet this woman was so suave and assured as practically to laugh at the demands of organized society . Aileen was fascinated . " You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commenting on her trip , " the women are slaves . Truly , only the gypsies appear to be free , and they , of course , have no position . The wives of most of the officials and men of title are really slaves , living in fear of their husbands . " Aileen smiled wanly at this . " That is probably not true of the East alone , " she said . Madame Rerstadt smiled wisely . " No , " she said , " not exactly . We have slaves here , too . In Ahmayreecah , too , yaays ? " She showed her even white teeth . Aileen laughed , thinking of her emotional enslavement to Cowperwood . How was it that a woman like this could be so wholly emancipated , caring apparently for no man , at least not deeply or torturingly , whereas she . . . At once she wished that she might know her better , perhaps by contact gather some of her emotional calm and social indifference . Curiously enough , Madame Rerstadt appeared to show more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in America . How long was she to be in Paris ? Where was she staying ? She suggestedthey have lunch together on the following day , to which Aileen agreed with alacrity . At the same time , her head was swimming with all of the practicalbusiness of the afternoon , and Tollifer 's part in it . For most certainly , and by the pleasant indirection of shopping , there had been conveyed to her a sense of her personal lacks , which , at the same time , she had been convinced could be remedied . There was to be a doctor , a masseuse , a diet , and a new method of facial massage . She was to be changed , and by Tollifer . But for what purpose ? And to what end ? Plainly , he was not attempting familiarities . There was only this platonic relationship . She was puzzled . Yet what differ/once ? Cowperwood was not interested , and she must find some way to go on with her life . Back in her hotel suite , Aileen felt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , to whom she could confide her troubles , one person with whom she could relax and be natural . She would like a friend whose criticism she need not fear , whose confidenceshe could trust . There was something about Maria Rerstadt , as she had pressed Aileen 's hand in parting , that made her feel that in her she might find these things or a semblance of them . But the original ten days which she had planned for this visit passed swiftly enough . In fact , when they were gone , she was by no means ready to return to London . For , as she suddenly sensed , Tollifer , with his advice and his array of skilled workers , had launched a campaign which meant a physical as well as aesthetic improvement which would require time , and might even result in a change of attitude on the part of Cowperwood . She was not old , she now said to herself , and now that he was involved in this engrossing commercialstruggle , he might be willing to accept her on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would , in England , she fancied , require a stabilization of his social life and might find it advisable as well as agreeable to live with her more constantly , to make a more open and public profession of his interest and satisfaction in so doing . And so , eagerly , she began to scan herself in the mirror , to take painstaking care to obey the dietary and beautifying instructions given to her daily by Sarah Schimmel . She began to recognize the effectiveness of the unique costumes being chosen for her . And so , rapidly , as she gained in self-confidence , and accordingly in poise , she began to think constantly of Cowperwood , so much so that she was quite gay in her anticipation of what must be his surprise and , she hoped , pleasure , when he saw her again . For that reason she decided to remain in Paris until she had lost at least twenty pounds in weight , and so could wear the creations which Monsieur Richard so enthusiastically planned for her . And she wished also to test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ah , if only this might not be all in vain ! In consequence , she wrote Cowperwood that her Paris visit was proving so interesting  --  thanks to Mr. Tollifer  --  that she was staying on three or four weeks longer . " For once in my life , " she added , with a trace of gaiety , " I 'm getting along very well without you , and am well looked after . " When Cowperwood read this , it had a strangely saddening effect on him . For he had so slyly arranged it all . At the same time there flashed into his mind the thought that Berenice had also had a part in it . Primarily , it had been her suggestion . He had seized upon it as the only way to happiness with her , and so it was . Still , what of a mind that could think so shrewdly and ruthlessly ? Might it not one day be turned on him ? And then , what , since he cared so much ? The idea was irritating . To dismiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , so , when the time came , he would meet that . As n result of his talk with Cowperwoodin Brown 's Hotel , Johnson decided that a meeting between Cowperwood and Lord Stane was the next logical step in arriving at a decision as to the part they might play in future negotiations . " You would n't risk anything by talking to him , " was the way he put it to Stane . " Of course , we 'll make it plain that if we go in with him , our services in helping him get control of the loop will cost him 5o per cent of whatever that control is . Then we might arrange with some of the shareholders of the Metropolitan and the District to come in and help make up the 51 per cent and so keep control . " Lord Stane nodded . " Go on , " he said . " That would fix it , you see , " continued Johnson , " so that whateverelse happened , we , with some others  --  Colvay , Jeems , and maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to deal with us as joint owners of this central service . " " That certainly sounds all right to me , " said Stane , surveying him calmly . " Anyway , I should like to meet the fellow . You may ask him to my home whenever you wish . Just let me know when it is to be . I can tell more about it after I meet him . " Accordingly , on a certain warm June day , Cowperwood climbed into a carriage with Johnson and together they drove through pleasantLondon streets to the home of Lord Stane . Cowperwood was doubtful as to how much of his intricate and secret plan he should reveal in this forthcoming interview . In fact , hep149had been playing with the thought that however successful he might be with Stane and Johnson , it would be well to sound out Abington Scarr . He might let him in on his Baker Street &; Waterlooact . Possessing that , and such other acts as he could pick up through Haddonfield and possibly Lord Ettinge , he would be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As they drew up to Stane 's house in Berkeley Square , he was impressed by its square , dignified solidity . It seemed to breathe a securitywhich certainly had nothing to do with trade . Inside , the liveried footman , the silence of the large salon on the first floor , created an atmosphere pleasing to him and yet not sufficient to disturb his personalsense of values . It was quite right for this man to be as secure as he could be . It was quite right for himself , if he could , to involve him and make him richer , or use him , and skill failing him , sweep all away . But now Johnson suggested that it might interest him to look at some of Lord Stane 's paintings , since the butler had just informed him that Stane had telephoned to say that he would be a few minuteslate . The attitude of the solicitor in his role of temporary host was anxious . Cowperwood said he would indeed enjoy passing the time in that way , and Johnson led him to an extensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gallery , pausing to examine several rare portraits by Romney and Gainsborough , Johnson launched upon a brief history of the House of Stane . The late Earl had been a cautious and studious person , interested principally in Hittite excavationsand translations , and had expended a great deal of money , for which historians , so it was said , were duly grateful . Young Stane , rather more than less alienated by his father 's antiquarian interests , had turned to society and finance for diversion and development . He was very popular , a distinguished fashion figure as well as financier . And in season this house was the scene of many social functions . His country seat in Tregasal was one of the show places of England . There was also a charming summer cottage at Pryor 's Cove , near Marlowe on the Thames , and a wine farm in France . At the mention of Berenice 's present abode , Cowperwood represseda smile , but was prevented from making any comment by the arrival of Stane himself , who greeted them both in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , Johnson ! And , of course , this is Mr. Cowperwood . " He extended his hand , and Cowperwood , measuring him swiftly and favorably , took it and pressed it heartily . " This is a pleasure and a privilege , I assure you , " he said . " Not at all , not at all , " replied Stane . " Elverson has told me all about you . I think , though , we might be a little more comfortable in the library . Shall we go ? " He pulled a bell rope , telling the man to bring drinks , and led the way into a charming room with french windows looking out on a walled garden . While he moved about , acting the part of host , Cowperwoodcontinued to study him . He found his own mood decidedlyfriendly toward this man . There was an easy , genial courtesy and awareness about him that bespoke value to the person who could win his confidence . But this confidence could not be won easily . He would have to be fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided definitely against revealingat this time the inside workings of his proposition . At the same time , he found himself thinking of Berenice , for he and she had tacitly agreed that she might be called on to play a social role in connection with just such people as Stane . But now that he proved to be so attractive , he was not sure that he was willing to have her do this . He composed himself , however , while Johnson began outlining his ideas on the underground situation . When Johnson had finished , Cowperwood began , softly and smoothly , expounding his plan of unification . He dwelt especially on electrification , lighting , the new method of separate motor power for each car , air brakes , and automatic signals . And at only one point did Stane interrupt to ask : " Do you contemplate a personal or directorial control of this entire system ? " " Directorial , of course , " replied Cowperwood , who was really contemplatingno such thing . " You see , " he went on , as both observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could bring about a unified system , to form a new company and include this Charing Cross which I now own . And in order to get the present shareholders of the loop companies to come in , I would offer them three shares in this larger company for each one they now hold in these smaller ones . And since the Charing Cross is going to cost at least  --  2,000,000 to build , you can see that there would be a considerable increase in the valuep151of their holdings . " He paused to note how this affected his listeners , and saw that it did so favorably . He then proceeded . " Would you say that the plan should be profitable , particularly when it is agreed beforehand that all of the lines of this new companyare to be modernized and operated as one system , and at no additional cost to the shareholders but rather by selling shares to the public ? " " I should certainly say so , " commented Stane , to which Johnson nodded in agreement . " Well , there you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cowperwood . " Of course , there might be additional ramifications , but that would be something for the directors of the new larger system to decide on . " He was thinking of Scarr , Haddonfield , and others whose acts , if he secured control of them , would have to be bought from him . But at this point Stane scratched his ear meditatively . " As I see it , " he said , " this three-for-one arrangement merely covers the matter of luring such shareholders as might be interested into joining with you on that basis . But you are forgetting , I think , the matter of sentiment , which is certain to be against you . And that being true , you may be sure that offering three shares for one will not bring in enough of the present owners to permit you to do as you wish on your terms , which , as I assume , would mean general control for you . For , you see , they are set on a purely English control . Both Johnson and I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act , have discovered that . Besides , there has already developed quite a little opposition in both the Metropolitan and the District , even a tendency to combine against you . And heaven knows the directors of those two lines have never been too affectionate towards each other up to this time ! " Here Johnson chuckled dryly . " So unless you move with the greatest caution and tact at every point , " continued Stane , " have the right people approached in the right way , and preferably by English rather than American factors , you are likely to find yourself blocked . " " Quite so , " said Cowperwood , who saw very clearly what Stane had in mind . If they were to be won over to the task of helping him pull this English chestnut out of the fire , they were going to require , not additional compensation  --  they could scarcely ask for more than he had already offered  --  but more likely some form of joint control with him . Or , if that could not be effected , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very likely , pro rata opportunitiesalong with himself in connection with the progressive development of this proposed system . And how was that to be arranged ? For the moment he was not a little puzzled , and to clarify his own as well as their thoughts , he now added : " It was in connection with that that I was thinking how I might interest both of you , for I realize that you understand this situation , and assuming that you are willing to co-operate with me , can do a great deal toward furthering more favorable sentiment . Just how do you think , apart from the three shares to one arrangement , you should be compensated ? What particular arrangement between the three of us would be agreeable to you ? " He paused . But the conversation as to this was much too extended and intricateto relate here . In the main , it dealt with preliminary work which would have to be done by Stane and Johnson . And this preliminarywork , as they now explained to Cowperwood , related more to social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purely financial affairs were not likely to make much headway . " In England , you see , " went on Stane , " one progresses more through favor and the friendship of financial as well as social groupsL/ than through particular individuals , however gifted they may be . And if you are not well and favorably known to certain groups and accepted by them , it may be difficult to proceed . You follow me ? " " Perfectly , " replied Cowperwood . " And , of course , this is never at any point a mere matter of cold and practical bargaining . There must be mutual understanding and respect . And that is not achieved in a moment . It depends not only on introductions but personal endorsements in a casual as well as definite social way . You follow me ? " " Perfectly , " replied Cowperwood . " But before that , there would have to be a very clear understandingas to what , apart from the exchange of shares , would be the reward of those who made possible such an advantageous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stane talked , Cowperwood sat relaxed in his chair , and although he seemed to be listening sympathetically enough , a closep153observer would have noticed a certain hardening of the eyes and tightening of the lips . He realized very clearly that in so instructing him Stane was condescending . For , of course , he had heard of the various scandals connected with his career and was aware of the fact that he was not admitted to the social worlds of Chicago and New York . And although he was extremely diplomatic and courteous , Cowperwood took his explanations for just what they were worth : the explanations of a man who stood well in the haut monde to one who had been rejected by it . And yet he was not in the least annoyedor dismayed . In fact , he was rather ironically amused . For he had the upper hand . He was going to make possible for Stane and his friends what no one else had been able to make possible . When Stane finally paused , Cowperwood questioned him about the details of this understanding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be best to leave that to Johnson . However , he already had in mind not only a guarantee of three for one of his present holdings in the District and Metropolitan but also some secret and inviolable agreement with Cowperwood whereby he and Johnson would be retained , protected , and financially enhanced as part of this great development . And so , while Stane calmly drew up his monocle and adjusted it in his right eye the better wherewith to contemplate him , Cowperwoodnow emphasized how really grateful he was for Stane 's personal interest and kindness in clarifying the significance of the situation . He was certain it could all be arranged to their mutual satisfaction . However , there was the task of financing , for which he himself would have to arrange . It would probably be necessary for him to return to America shortly to raise this money , before talking with the various English shareholders  --  a point of view with which Stane agreed . However , already Cowperwood had in his mind a 49-51 per cent control of a loaning company which might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assure its capture and control in the event of disaster . He would see . As for Berenice and Stane , ah , well , he would wait and see as to that also . He was sixty years old , and except for fame and public acclaim , it might , in a very few years , make no particular difference . Actually , because of the relentless whirl of duties now threatening to engulf him , he was beginning to feel a little weary . Sometimes , at the close of a busy day , he felt this whole London venture to be such a senseless thing for him to be undertaking at this time . Why , only a year or two before , in Chicago , he had been saying to himself that if he could but achieve the extension of his franchises there , he would be willing to disassociate himself from the direction , and retire and travel . He had even thought at the time that if Berenice finally refused his offer , and he were left to himself again , he might patch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his New York house and such amusements and activities as would not overtaxwhat he looked upon as a deserved leisure . But now , here he was . And what was it all about ? What was he to get out of it , other than the pleasure with Berenice , which , had she willed it otherwise , he might have found in a more peaceful way . At the same time , there was the point made by her , and even by himself , that he owed it to himself , to his life , his reputation as representingan immense creative force , a financial figure of the first rank , to go forward and round out his career in some such climactic fashion as this . But could it be effected without impairing his reputation as well as his fortune ? Would it be possible , in view of the present state of opinion of him at home , to go back and , in a reasonablybrief time , assemble the required money ? In short , his position in almost all of its aspects was care-full and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first premonitorybreath of the oncoming winter of age . That evening , after dinner , he talked to Berenice about his plans . It would be best , he thought , to have Aileen accompany him to New York . He would need to entertain a number of people , and it would look better if his wife were there . Besides , at this point , they would have to be especially careful to keep her in a good mood , just when everything was hanging in the balance . MEANWHILE , Aileen , in Paris , at the endof a month , was , as all her new friends declared , " a different person ! " Twenty pounds lighter ; her color , her eyes , as well as her mood brighter ; her hair arranged " a la chanticleer , " as Sarah Schimmel described it ; her gowns designed by M. Richard , her shoes by M. Kraussmeier , all as Tollifer had planned.  |p155She  had achieved a real friendship with Madame Rerstadt , and the sheik , though his attentions were a little bothersome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for herself alone ; in fact , seemed bent on developing an affair with her . But that costume ! White , and of the finest silk and wool , with a white silk cord bindingit at his waist . And his oily , savage-looking black hair ! And the small silver rings in his ears ! And long , thin , pointed and upwardcurlingred leather slippers on his feet , which were certainly not small . And that hawklike nose and dark piercing eyes ! When with him , one became part of a show , gazed at by all . And if she entertainedhim alone , she spent most of the time trying to avoid his caresses . " Now , please , Ibrihim , " she would say . " Do n't forget , I 'm married , and in love with my husband . I like you , I really do . But you must n't be begging me to do what I do n't want to do , because I wo n't , and if you keep on , I wo n't see you at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisted , in quite good English , " we have so mooch in common . You like to play , and so do I. We like to talk , ride , gamble , play ze races a little . But still , you are like me , sober , not so . . . so .... " " Flighty ? " interjected Aileen . " What you mean , flighty ' ? " he inquired . " Oh , I do n't know . " She felt as though she were talking to a child . " Fussy , jumpy . " She waved her hands to indicate instability , mental as well as emotional . " So ? So ? Ha , ha ! Flighty ! It is so ! I understan ' . You are not flighty ! Gudd ! So I like you , mooch . Ha , ha ! Very mooch . And me ? You like me  --  the Sheik Ibrihim ? " Aileen laughed . " Yes , I do , " she said . " Of course , I think you drink too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man  --  cruel and selfish and a lot of things . But I like you just the same , and ... " " Tchk , tchk , " clucked the sheik . " That is not mooch for a man like me . If I do not love , I do not sleep . " " Oh , stop being silly ! " exclaimed Aileen . " Do go over there and fix yourself a drink . And then go away and come back tonight and take me to dinner . I 'd like to go to that Mr. Sabinal 's place again . " And so Aileen 's days were passing agreeably enough . Her former tendency toward melancholia was dispelled , and she began to feel that her state was not as hopeless as it had been . Cowperwood had written her that he would be coming to Paris , and in anticipation of his arrival she was prepared to surprise him with the most impressiveof M. Richard 's creations . And Tollifer had suggested that they take him to Orsignat 's for dinner , an interesting little place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right in the shadow of Notre Dame . Sabinal was to furnish Orsignat , for the occasion , with the wines , brandies , liqueurs , aperitifs , and cigars . And Orsignat , under the direction of Tollifer , was to furnish a repast of which no gourmet could complain . For this time it was Tollifer who was seekingto make an impression . Among the guests were to be Madame Rerstadt , the devoted sheik , and Marigold , who because of her interestin Tollifer was still in Paris and , by his orders , reconciled to Aileen . " You and your husband , " he said to Aileen , " are so familiar with all the well-known places . I think it would be more original if we got up something quite simple for a change . " And he explained his plan to her . To make sure of Cowperwood 's presence , Tollifer had her cable him a pressing invitation to the dinner which they had arranged in his honor . And Cowperwood , on receipt of this , smiled , and wired his acceptance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found Aileen more attractive physically than he had thought she could be at this time in her life , and particularly after all she had endured . Her hair was a study in swirls that emphasized the good points of her face . And her dress was designed to show the lines of her much reduced figure . " Aileen ! " he exclaimed , on seeing her , " I 've never seen you lookingbetter ! What in the world have you been doing ? That dress is most effective . And I like your hair . What have you been living on , birdseed ? " " Well , just about that , " returned Aileen , smiling . " I have n't had a single meal that I would call a meal in thirty days . But you may be sure of one thing ! Now that I 've gotten it off , it 's going to stay off ! But did you have an easy trip over ? " As she talked she was supervisingthe services of Williams , who was arranging glasses and liqueurs on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was smooth as a pond , " he said , " except for about fifteen minutes , when it looked as though everybody would go under . But we were all fine when we landed . "  | " Oh , that dreadful Channel ! " said Aileen , conscious all the while of his eyes upon her , and , in spite of herself , nervously excited by his complimentary remarks . " But what about this banquet tonight ? " " Well , Mr. Tollifer and I have arranged a little party . You know , that man Tollifer is a perfect jewel . I like him ever so much . And I think you 'll be interested in some of the people who are coming , especially my friend , Madame Rerstadt . She and I have been going around together a great deal . She is charming , and different from any woman I have ever known . " Now that she had lived for a month in the company of Tollifer and his colorful group , she felt at ease in pointing out to Cowperwooda woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have jealously intrigued to prevent his noticing any woman as attractive as her new friend . He noted her new air of confidence , her assurance , good nature , and revived interest in life . If things were going to go as well as this , decidedly there might be no further cause for bitterness between them . At the same time ran the thought that this development was his doing , not hers . And she so unconsciousof it . But no sooner had that thought been indulged in than he realized that it was really because of Berenice that this had happened . For he could feel that Aileen was inspired , not so much by his presence as by that of the man whom he had employed . But where was he ? Cowperwood felt he had no right to inquire . He was in the position of a man who contrives a show ; a masquerade , but is not permitted to announce himself as showman . But there was Aileen saying : " Frank , you 'll want to dress . And I have some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's right , " he said . " But I have a piece of news for you . Do you think you could leave Paris just now and run back to New York with me ? " " What do you mean ? " Her voice was full of surprise . For she had been hoping that they might visit at least a few of the principal resorts of Europe this summer , and now here he was talking of returning to New York . Perhaps he was giving up his London plans entirely in order to return to America for good . She was a little disturbed , for somehow this seemed to shadow and even threaten all that she had so recently achieved . " Oh , nothing at all serious , " said Cowperwood , smiling . " Nothing has gone wrong in London . I have n't been thrown out . In fact , it looks as though they might like me to stay . But only on condition that I go back home and return with a lot of money . " He smiled ironically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knowing so much of his past experiences , she could not help sharing his cynicism . " Well , that does n't surprise me , " she said . " But let 's talk about it tomorrow . Suppose you dress now . " " Right ! I 'll be ready in a half-hour . " Aileen covered him with her eyes as he passed into another room . As usual , he was certainly looking the picture of success . He was cheerful , adroit , aggressive . Plainly , he was interested by her present appearance and manner . She was sure of that , even though still conscious of the fact that he did not love her and that she feared him . What a blessing that the gay , handsome Tollifer had blown into her life ! If she were to return to New York now , what was to become of this quite inexplicable and now quite soundly established friendship between herself and this handsome young loafer ? BEFORE Cowperwood reappeared , Tolliferbreezed in . Handing his top hat and stick to Williams , he marched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hello ! " she called out to him . " Mr. Cowperwood is here ; he 's dressing . I 'll be with you in a second . " " Righto ! The others should be here any moment now . " As he spoke , he heard a slight noise and turned just in time to note Cowperwood 's entrance into the reception room by another door . The two gave each other a swift glance of recognition . Tollifer , conscious of his obligation , stepped quickly and cordially forward . But Cowperwood anticipated his address by saying : " Well , we meet again . How are you enjoying Paris ? " " Oh , very much , " said Tollifer . " This season is particularly gay . I 've been running into all sorts of people . And the weather has been perfect . You know Paris in the spring . I find it the gayest and most refreshing time . " " I hear we are to be the guests of my wife this evening . " " Yes , along with some others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " Suppose we have something to drink ! " They were off on a casual conversation regarding London and Paris , both doing their best to ignore the relationship between them , and both succeeding . Aileen entered and greeted Tollifer . And then Ibrihim arriving , and ignoring Cowperwood as he would a sheepherderof his own land , proceeded to pay his compliments to Aileen . Cowperwood was at first a little astonished , then amused . The gleaming eyes of the Arab intrigued him . " Interesting , " he said to himself . " This fellow Tollifer is actually creating something here . And this robed Bedouin covets my wife . This should be a fine evening ! " Next entered Marigold Brainerd . Her personality pleased him , and the appreciation appeared to be mutual . But this rapproachementwas soon interrupted by the arrival of the serene and exotic Rerstadt , swathed in a cream white shawl , the long silken fringe trailing over one arm and about her feet . Cowperwood looked with approval on her olive-tinted face , framed so attractively by sleek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung almost to her shoulders . Observing him , and impressed , as were most women , Madame Rerstadt readily comprehended Aileen 's plight . This was not a man for any one woman . One must sip only and be content with that . Aileen should be brought to comprehend that truth . But Tollifer was impatiently urging that it was time to leave , and obeying his insistence they departed for Orsignat 's . A private dining room that was half-balcony commanded , through open french windows , a full view of Notre Dame and the green square before it . But all , as they entered , commented on the seeming lack of preparation for their dinner party , for there was only a plain wooden table completely bare . Tollifer , entering last , ex-claimed : " Why , what the devil does this mean ? I do n't understand . There 's something wrong here . They 're surely expecting us . Wait , I 'll go and see , " and turning swiftly , he disappeared . " I really ca n't understand this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged . " And she frowned and pouted and looked her irritated best . " We 've probably been shown to the wrong room , " said Cowperwood.  | " They do not expect , what ? " the sheik was saying to Marigold , when the door of an adjoining serving room suddenly opened , and in dashed Harlequin , enormously concerned . This was Pantaloon himself , tall and gawky , his garb the usual star-and-moon sewn slip , cornucopia atop his head , his ears yellowed with grease paint , his eyesockets green , his cheeks cerise , ruffs and bangles about his wrists and neck , tufts of hair protruding from under his horn hat , immense white gloves on his hands , long , flail-like shoes on his feet . Looking about with a kind of lunatic anguish and despair , he exclaimed : " Ah , Mon Dieu ! Sacre-bleu ! Ah , ladies and gentlemen ! This is ... indeed , this is . . . ah , no linen ! No silver ! No chairs ! Pardon ! Pardon ! Something must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something must have gone wrong . Something must be done ! Ah ! " and clapping his long hands and gazing toward the door , as though troops of servants must immediately respond to his bidding , he waited , without response . Then once more clapping , he waited , one ear cocked toward the door . After which , no sound ensuing , he turned to his audience , who , now comprehending , retreated to the walls to give Harlequin his stage . Finger to his lips , he tiptoed to the door and listened . Still no sound . After stooping down and peering through the keyhole , his head cocked now this way , now that , he looked back at them , and , with an amazing grimace , again put his finger to his lips and glued one eye to the keyhole . Finally he jumped back , falling flat as he did so , then jumped up and backed away , while the door flew open for a half-dozen waiters bearing linen , dishes , silver , glasses , trays  --  an orderly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignoring him completely while he leaped and clatteredabout , exclaiming : " So ! So ! You come , do you ? You pigs ! You loafers ! Put down the plates ! Put down the plates , I say ! " This to the man who was already swiftly and dexterously laying the plates . And to the waiter who was placing the silver : " Lay the silver , I tell you ! And see that you make no noise ! Swine ! " After which he picked up a knife and re-laid it in exactly the same position . To the waiter who was arrangingthe glasses , he exclaimed : " No , no , no ! Dunce ! Will you never learn ? See ! " and taking up the glasses , replaced them precisely as they had been . Then stepping aside to survey them , he knelt downp161and squinted , then moved one small liqueur glass a thousandth of an inch . Of course , during all this folderol , everyone , with the exception of Ibrihim  --  who simply stared queerly at all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeded to follow closely upon the heels of the headwaiter , actually stepping on them at times , while the waiter pretended not to see him . As he went out , Harlequinfollowed him , looking back as he shouted : " Bah ! Conspiracy ! Bah ! " " A good show ! " remarked Cowperwood to Madame Rerstadt . " That is Grelizan , of the Trocadero , the cleverest clown in Europe , " she said . " No ! " exclaimed Marigold , whose estimate of his humor was rapidly heightened by the news of his fame . At first fearful , but now elated by the success of this adventure , Aileen beamed with pleasure . Since Cowperwood chose to praise her ingenuity , and that of Tollifer , there was nothing Grelizan could do now that did not seem amusing to her , though he did produce a momentary chill when he stumbled and fell while bearing a large silver tureen filled with what appeared to be bright red . tomato soup . The brilliant orange confetti was deftly hurled into the air and fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , , screams and laughter . Again he hurried back to the pantry , this time to bring no more than a single crouton held in a pair of sugar tongs , and again and again to follow the incoming waiters with exaggerated supervision , , while they scrupulously served the courses . Imitation ices were served last . Beneath the surface of each was a frail inflated balloon , which , when pierced with a fork , revealed , in Cowperwood 's case , the key to the city of London ; in Aileen 's , a bowing and smiling figure of Monsieur Richard , scissors in hand ; for Madame Rerstadt , a small world globe , with a dotted line touching all of the places she had traveled to ; for Ibrihim , a tiny horse with a sheik astride ; for Tollifer , a small roulette wheel , with the indicator at zero ; for Marigold , a handful of toy figures of men : a soldier , a king , a dandy , an artist , a musician . There was much laughter over these , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the applause of all , Cowperwood and Madame Rerstadt calling : " Bravo ! Bravo ! "  | " Delightful ! " she exclaimed . " I shall write him a note . " Afterward , at Le Grand Guignol , which began at midnight , they saw the celebrated Laloute impersonate the celebrities of the day . Later Tollifer suggested Sabinal 's . And by dawn they were all fully satisfied that this night in Paris had been wonderful . COWPERWOOD concluded from all this that in Tollifer he had picked someone even more resourceful than he had hoped for . The man was gifted , decidedly . With the least encouragement , and , of course , financial aid , he could certainly make a world for Aileen with which , in the event of their separation , she might reasonably be satisfied . This was a situation requiring some thought . For , of course , if she were to find out about Berenice , she would probably turn to Tollifer for advice . And then it would be a matter of having to buy them off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aileen in a social limelight of her own , and with her husband rarely present , there would be increasedspeculation as to where he was , speculation which could lead but in one direction : Berenice . Best to persuade Aileen to go back to New York with him and leave Tollifer behind . It would , for the time being , modify the ascendancy which obviously he had already achieved , and prevent it from being too obvious to others . It developed that Aileen , on her part , was entirely willing . There were various reasons . She feared that otherwise Cowperwood might take another woman along with him , or that he might meet one in New York . And there was the effect on Tollifer and his friends . For just now Cowperwood was more of a public figure than ever , and it was among the highest of distinctions to be his acknowledgedwife . Her chief curiosity was whether Tollifer would follow her or not . For this was a visit that was likely to last for six months , maybe longer . Immediately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His reactions were rather complicated , for in the backgroundthere was Marigold , who wanted him to cruise with her to the North Cape . By now , he had seen enough of her to feel that if he continued his suit , she might actually arrange a divorce and marry him , and she possessed considerable money of her own.  |p163He  did not really love her ; he was still dreaming of a romance with a younger girl . Then , there was the matter of immediate and continued income . Any interruption of that would at once end his butterfly existence . He felt that Cowperwood , though having given no hint , would prefer him to return to New York . But whether he went or stayed , it had come to the point , he felt , when continued pursuit of Aileen , without some declaration of affection , would not seem to her reasonable . He was satisfied that she would yield nothing , but it would flatter her . And this , in itself , was excuse enough for the approach . " Pshaw ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This throws me all out ! " He paced nervously back and forth , having dropped in to see her after a luncheon with Marigold at Madame Gemy 's bar . His face simulated grave concern and disappointment . " What 's the matter ? " inquired Aileen , seriously . " What has gone wrong ? " She noticed that he had been drinking , not enough to unbalance him in any way but sufficient to darken his mood . " This is too bad , " he said , " and just when I was thinking that something might come out of it all for both of us . " Aileen stared at him , not a little puzzled . To be sure , this more or less anomalous relationship had been growing on her . In an unformulated way , she was attracted to him more than she had acknowledged to herself . Yet having observed him with Marigold and others , she was convinced , as she had said more than once , that a woman could not trust him from one end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether you feel it or not , " he went on , calculatingly , " but there 's a lot more than just a social acquaintance between you and me . I 'll admit that when I first met you , I did n't think there would be . I was interested by the fact that you were Mrs. Cowperwood , part of a life that I had heard a great deal about . But after we 'd had a few talks together , I began to feel something else . I 've seen a lot of trouble in my life . I 've had my ups and downs , and I suppose I always will . But there was something about you those first few days on the boat that made me think maybe you had , too . That 's why I wanted to be with you , although , as you saw for yourself , there were lots of other women whose company I might have had . " He lied with the air of one who had never told anything butp164the truth . And this bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and possibly that was true . Yet if he did not really like her , why all this effort on his part to improve her appearance and reorganize her onetime power to charm ? She experienced a sudden emotional glow , perhaps half motherhood and half youth and desire . For one could not help liking this waster ; he was so genial , cheering , and , in a subtle way , affectionate . " But what difference does it make about my going back to New York ? " she asked , wonderingly . " Ca n't we be friends just the same ? " Tollifer considered . Having established this matter of his affection , now what ? Always the thought of Cowperwood dominated him . What would he desire him to do ? " just think , " he said , " you 're running off in the ideal time over here , June and July . And just when we were getting into the swing of things ! " He lit a cigarette and fixed himself a drink . Why had n't Cowperwood given him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Paris or not ? Perhaps he would yet , but if so , he 'd better be quick about it . " Frank has asked me to go , and I ca n't do anything else , " she said , calmly . " As for you , I do n't imagine you 'll be lonely . " " You do n't understand , " he said . " You 've made a kind of center for me over here . I feel happier now and more contented than I have for years . And if you go back now , it may be broken up . " " Nonsense ! Please do n't be foolish . I 'd like to stay here , I admit . Only I do n't know how it could be managed . When I get back to New York and see how things are , I 'll let you know . But it 's my belief we 'll be coming back soon . If not , and you still feel this way , you can come home , and I 'll be seeing you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aileen ! " exclaimed Tollifer , affectionately , seeing his opportunity . He crossed over and took her arm . " That 's wonderful ! That 's what I 've been wanting you to say . Is that how you feel ? " he asked , lookingcoaxingly into her eyes , and , before she could prevent it , slipping his arms around her waist and kissing her , not passionately but with seemingly genuine affection . But Aileen , conscious of her dominant desire to retain him and yet give Cowperwood no real cause for complaint , definitely though good-naturedly resisted . No , no , no , " she said , " remember what you were just saying . Thisp165is to be a real friendship , if you want it that way . But nothing more than that . Besides , why do n't we go out somewhere . I have n't been out today , and I have a new gown I want to wear . " Satisfied to let the situation rest for the time being , he suggested a new place out near Fontainbleau , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aileenstepping off the liner Saxonia . The usual interviewers . The newspapers , aware of his expressed intention of invading the London underground field , now wanting to know who were to be his directors , investors , managers , also whether the sudden reported heavy buying of both the common and preferredstock of the District and the Metropolitan was not really being done by his own men . This disclaimed by him in an adroit statement , which , when published , caused many Londoners , as well as Americans , to smile . Pictures of Aileen , her new clothes , and references to her appearance in what was hinted to be near-society on the Continent . And , simultaneously , sailing with Marigold for the North Cape , Bruce Tollifer . But no mention of this in any paper . And at Pryor 's Cove , Berenice was an outstanding local success . Since she so carefully concealed her shrewdness behind a veil of simplicity , innocence , and conventionality , everyone convinced that there would follow in due time , for her , a distinguished and correct marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoiding the dull , the commonplace , and the lecherous , regarding favorably only those who were conventionally minded , men as well as women . Even a more promising trait , as her new friends saw it , was her penchant for that type of unattractive woman  --  neglected wife , spinster , maiden aunt  --  who , socially wellborn , was still hard put to it for pleasurable attention of any kind . For , having no need to fear the younger and more attractive hostesses and matrons , she knew that if she won the more lonely women to her , she would be able to make her way into the most important functions . Just as fortunate was her tendency to admire the wholly innocuous and socially correct stripling or young master of title and social honor . In fact , the young curates and rectors for miles about Pryor's Cove were already jubilant because of the spiritual discernment of this young newcomer . Her demure appearance of a Sabbath morn in any of the neighborhood chapels of the English High Church , invariably in company with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , was sufficient to verify every good thing that was rumored of her . Coincidentally , Cowperwood on flying visits to Chicago , Baltimore , Boston , Philadelphia , in connection with bis London plans , and within the innermost sanctums of those most religious of all American institutions , the banks and trust companies , conferring with such individuals as would be at once the most useful , the most influential , and the least difficult to manage . And the blandness of his expression as he explained the certainty of larger and more permanent profits than had ever as yet been taken from any undergroundproject . And , despite the so recent denunciations of him , being listened to with awe and even genuine respect . True , in Chicago , there were mumblings of contempt and hatred , but at the same time , envy . For the man was a force , attracting , as always , a veritable glare of publicity . In so short a time as a month he saw his primary problems solved . In many places , tentative agreements were made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be organized in order to take over all the lines . For each share of the lines taken over , three shares in his own major company were to be paid . Indeed , except for some minor conferences on his Chicago holdings , he was really free to return to England , and would have done so had it not been for a new encounter of an old and familiar type . It had happened so often , in times past , when his name was being paraded before public eyes : he had been approached by ambitious and attractive women to whom his wealth , fame , and personal charm were irresistible . And now , because of a necessary visit to Baltimore , a vivid meeting of this sort . It occurred in the hotel where he was staying . And to his mind at the time it seemed in no way to shadow the affection he had for Berenice . Nonetheless , at midnight , just returned from the home of the president of the Maryland Trust Company , and while sittingat his desk making notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his door . Answering , he was informed by a feminine voice that a relative wished to speak to him . He smiled , for in allp167his experience he did not recall exactly that form of approach . He opened the door and saw a girl who , at a glance , he decided was not to be ignored and concerning whom he was instantly curious . She was young , slender , of medium height , assured , forceful , and magnetic . Her features were beautiful , and her dress . " A relative ? " he said , smiling and allowing her to enter . " Yes , " she replied with the utmost calm . " I am a relative of yours , although you may not believe it right away . I am the granddaughter of a brother of your father 's . Only my name is Maris . My mother 's name was Cowperwood . " He asked her to be seated and placed himself opposite her . Her eyes , which were large and round and of a silvery blue , contemplated him unwaveringly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he inquired . " Cincinnati , " she returned , " although my mother was born in North Carolina . It was her father who came from Pennsylvania , and not so far from where you were born , Mr. Cowperwood . Doyles-town . " " That 's true , " he said . " My father did have a brother who once lived in Doylestown . Besides , I may add , you have the Cowperwood eye . " " Thanks , " she returned , and continued looking at him as fixedly as he looked at her . Then she added , unembarrassed by his gaze : " You may think it strange , my coming here at this hour , but I am stopping at this hotel , too , you see . I am a dancer , and the company I am with is playing here this week . " " Is it possible ? We Quakers seem to wander into strange fields ! " " Yes , " she replied , and smiled warmly , a smile reserved and yet rich , suggesting imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt its force as fully as he observed its character . " I 've just come from the theater , " she went on . " But I 've been readingabout you , and seeing your picture in the papers here , and since I 've always wanted to know you , I decided I 'd better come now . " " Are you a good dancer ? " he inquired . " I wish you 'd come and see and judge for yourself . " " I was returning to New York in the morning , but if you will have breakfast with me , I think I might stay over . " " Oh , yes , of course I will , " she said . " But do you know , I 've been imagining myself talking to you like this for years . Once , two years ago , when I was unable to get a job of any kind , I wrote you a letter , but then I tore it up . You see , we are the poor Cowperwoods . " " Too bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What was it you wanted to tell me ? " " Oh , how talented I was , and that I was your grandniece . And if I were given a chance , how sure I was that I would be a great dancer . And now I 'm glad I did n't write you , because I 'm here with you now and you can see me dance . By the way , " she went on , still fixing him with her magnetic blue eyes , " our company opens in New York for the summer , and I hope you 'll see me there , too . " " Well , if you are as lovely a dancer as you are to look at , you should be a sensation . " " I 'll let you tell me tomorrow night about that . " She stirred as if to move , but then hesitated . " What is your first name , did you say ? " he finally asked . " Lorna . " " Lorna Maris , " he repeated . " Is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did think once of changing it to Cowperwood , so you might hear of me . But I decided that name was n't as good for a dancer as it was for a financier . " They continued to gaze at each other . " How old are you , Lorna ? " " Twenty , " she said , simply , " or I will be in November . " The silence that followed became full of meaning . Eyes said all that eyes could say . A few seconds more , and he merely signaled with his finger . She rose and went to him quickly , almost dancing as she did so , and threw herself into his arms . " Beautiful ! " he said . " And to have you come just this way ... charming ... " IT WAS with puzzled thoughts thatCowperwood parted with Lorna the next day at noon . Throughout this fever which had seized upon him , and , for the time being , commanded his every fiber and impulse , he was actually not unmindful of Berenice . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outward forces , would not burn down a house . And there were no outward forces restraining , orp169even capable of restraining , either Cowperwood or Lorna under the circumstances . But when she left him to go to the theater his mind resumed its normal trend and occupied itself with the anomaly which Lorna and Berenice presented . Throughout all of eight years he had been swayed by the desirability as well as the unobtainability of Berenice , and more recently by her physical and aesthetic perfection . And yet he had allowed this coarser though still beautiful force to becloud and even temporarily efface all that . Alone in his room , he asked himself whether he was to blame . He had not sought out this latest temptation ; it had come upon him , and suddenly . Besides , in his nature there was room , and even necessity , for many phases of experience , many sources and streams of nourishment . True , he had told Berenice in the fever of his zest for her , and almost continuously since , that she was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense this was still true . Nevertheless , here and now was this consuming and overwhelmingforce , as represented by Lorna , which might be differentiatedas the mysterious , compelling charm of the new and unexplored , especially where youth and beauty and sex are involved . Its betraying power , he said to himself , could best be explained by the fact that it was more powerful than the individual or his intentions . It came , created its own fever , and worked its results . It had done so with Berenice and himself , and now again with Lorna Maris . But one thing he clearly recognized even now , and that was that it would never supersede his affection for Berenice . There was a difference ; he could see it and feel it clearly . And this difference lay in the temperamental as well as mental objectives of the two girls . Although of the same age , Lorna , with a considerably more rugged and extended life experience , was still content with what could be achieved through the glorification of her own physical and purely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due an enticing and exciting dancer . Berenice 's temperamental response and her resulting program were entirely different : broader , richer , a product of social and aesthetic sense involving peoples and countries . She , like himself , had an abiding faith in the dominance of mind and taste . Hence the ease and grace with which she had blended herself into the atmosphere and social forms and precedents of England . Obviously , and for all the vivid and exciting sensual power of Lorna , the deeper and more enduring power and charm lay within Berenice . In other words , her ambitions and reactions were in every way more significant . And when Lorna had gone , although he did not at the moment care to contemplate that thought , Berenice would still be present . Yet how , in the ultimate accounting , would he adjust all this ? Would he able to conceal this adventure , which he had no intention of immediately terminating ? And if Berenice discovered it , how would he satisfy her ? He could not solve that before a shaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That night , after the performance , Cowperwood decided that Lorna Maris was not so much a great as a sensational dancer , one who would shine brilliantly for a few years and eventually perhaps marry a wealthy man . But now , as he saw her dance , he found her enticing , in her silken clown costume , with loose pantaloons and long-fingered gloves . To the accompaniment of lights which cast exaggerated shadows , and ghostly music , she sang and danced the bogey man who might catch you if you did n't watch out ! Another dance was corybantic . In a short sleeveless slip of white chiffon , her exquisite arms and legs bare , her hair a whirling mass of powdered gold , she suggested to the utmost the abandon of a bacchante . Still another dance presented her as a pursued and terrified innocent seeking to escape from the lurking figures of would-be ravishers . She was so often recalled that the management had to limit her encores , and later in New York she colored , for that season , the entire summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cowperwood 's surprise and gratification , Lorna was quite as much talked of as himself . Orchestras everywhere were playing her songs ; in the popular vaudeville houses there were imitations of her . Merely to be seen with her was to inspire comment , and therein lay his greatest problem , for the very papers which regularly presented Lorna 's fame also presented his own . And this evoked in him the greatest caution , as well as a very real mental distress regarding Berenice . She might read or hear or be whispered to by someone if they were seen publicly together . At the same time , he and Lorna were infatuated and wished to be together as much as possible . In the case of Aileen , at least , he decided on a frank confession to her that in Baltimore he had met the granddaughter of his brother , a very gifted girl , who was in a theatricalp171production playing in New York . Would Aileen care to invite her to the house ? Having already read notices of Lorna and seen pictures of her in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for that reason willing to extend the invitation . At the same time , the beauty , poise , and self-assurance of the girl , as well as the mere fact that she had met and introduced herself to Cowperwood , were sufficient to embitter Aileen against her and to renew her old suspicion as to Cowperwood 's real motives . Youth  --  the irrecoverable . Beauty  --  that wraith of perfection that came and went as a shadow . Yet were both fire and storm . It gave Aileen no real satisfaction to escort Lorna through the galleries and gardens of the Cowperwood palace . For , as she could see , with what Lorna had she did not need those things , and because of what Aileen lacked , they were of no avail to her . Life went with beauty and desire ; where they were not was nothing . . . And Cowperwood desired beauty and achieved it for himself  --  life , color , fame , romance . Whereas , she .. . Now enmeshed in the necessity of pretending engagements and business which did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paradise , Cowperwood decided that it would be better if Tollifer were present , and arranged to have him recalled by the Central Trust Company . He might keep Aileen from thinking about Lorna . So Tollifer , gayly afloat off the North Cape with Marigold and a party of her friends , and greatly disappointed by his recall , was obliged to state that financial affairs required his immediate return to New York . And soon after his return , and doing his best to amuse himself as well as Aileen , he heard rumors of Lorna and Cowperwood , and was , of course , interested . Yet , although envying Cowperwood his luck , he was careful at every point to belittle and deny all gossip that he heard , and in particular to shield him from any suspicion on the part of Aileen . Unfortunately , he arrived too late to forestall an inevitable article in Town Topics , which presently fell into Aileen 's hands . It producedin her the usual effect , the old bitter contemplation of her husband 's besetting vice . No matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his power of achievement , he must allow these petty vagrants , infinitely beneath him , to tarnish and becloud what would otherwise have been a tremendous and untarnished public position.  | There was one consolation . If she were once again to be humiliated in this way , there was Berenice Fleming to be humiliated also . For Aileen had long been consciously irritated by the unseen presence of Berenice ever in the background . And observing Berenice 's New York house to be closed , she assumed that Cowperwood must be neglecting her also . For most certainly he was showing no desire to leave the city . One of the excuses which he gave for remaining in New York related to the nomination and possible election of William Jennings Bryan , a political firebrand , who , with economic and social theoriessomewhat at variance with the current capitalistic views of how money should be managed and divided , was seeking to bridge the then unbridgeable gulf between the rich and the poor . And , in consequence , in the United States there was at that time a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this man actually win the presidency . This permitted Cowperwood to say to Aileen that it would be dangerous for him to leave the country at this time , since on Bryan 's stabilizing defeat depended his own financial success . And he wrote Berenice to the same effect . That ultimately she was not permitted to believe him was due to the fact that Aileen had mailed a copy of Town Topics to her New York address , and , in due time , it arrived at Pryor 's Cove . AMONG all the men Berenice had metthus far , Cowperwood alone , with his strength and achievements , supplied the most glamor . But , apart from men , even Cowperwood and the elements of satisfaction and fulfillment which he offered , there was the color of life itself at Pryor 's Cove . Here , for the first time in her life , her social problems , if not settled , were at least temporarily disposed of and she was free to indulge her extreme egoism and yield to her narcissistic impulse to pose and play . Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process . In the morning , after hours in her bath and before her mirror , she loved to pick and choose costumes suitable to her mood : this hat did this , this ribbon did that , these earrings , this belt , these slippers ; so it went . Sometimes , chin in hand , her elbow resting on the gold-1p173stained marble of her dressing-table , she would gaze into the mirror studying her hair , her lips , her eyes , her breasts , her arms . And it was with the greatest care that she selected the silver , the china , the linen , the flowers , for the table , always with a view to the resulting effect . And although usually only her mother ; Mrs. Evans , the housekeeper ; and Rose , the maid , were there to see , it was herself who was the chief spectator . And , in the lovely walled garden off her bedroom , when the moon was up , she strolled and dreamed , thinking of Cowperwood , and frequently wishing for him intensely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring an exquisitely satisfying reunion . Mrs. Carter frequently marveled at her daughter 's self-absorption , wondering why she so often sought to be alone when there was a social world steadily unfolding before her . Yet in due course , into the midst of this , came Lord Stane . It was some three weeks after Cowperwood 's departure , and he was motoring from Tregasal to London , dropping in ostensibly to look after his horses and bid his new tenants welcome . He was especially curious because he had been informed that the girl was the ward of Frank Cowperwood . After all that had passed between herself and Cowperwood concerningthis man , Berenice was at once interested and not a little amused , remembering the hairpins and brushes and the unknown Miss Hathaway . Nevertheless , she appeared smiling and confident as she greeted him . The effect of her white dress , blue slippers , blue ribbon around her waist and blue velvet band encircling her foamingred hair , was not lost on Stane . As he bowed over her slim hand , he said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life was an occasion , and certainly a fitting ward for the ambitiousand powerful Cowperwood . His eyes concealed inquiry but not admiration . " I hope you will pardon the intrusion of your landlord , " he began . " I have several horses here that I am about to send to France , and I find it necessary to look them over . " " Ever since we have been living here , " said Berenice , " Mother and I have been hoping to meet the owner of this adorable place . It is too lovely for words . And my guardian , Mr. Cowperwood , has spoken of you . " " Decidedly , I am obligated to him for that , " said Stane , fascinated by her poise . " As for Pryor 's Cove , that I ca n't claim credit for . It 's really an heirloom , one of the family treasures . "  | Invited to stay for tea , he accepted . He asked whether they were to be long in England . Berenice , determined at once to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not say ; it depended on how much she and her mother liked England . Meanwhile , his gaze returned again and again to meet her still blue eyes , and because of his manner she now ventured upon innocent liberties which otherwise she would not have taken . Since he was going to look at his horses , might she not look at them , too ? Stane was delighted , and together they proceeded to the paddock beyond the stables . He asked whether everything was being looked after to her satisfaction . Would she and her mother accept the use of the horses for riding or driving ? Would she prefer that the gardener or farmer make any changes or rearrangements ? There were , perhaps , too many sheep . He had been thinking of selling some of them . Berenice protested that she adored the sheep , that she wanted nothing changed . Well , in two or three weeks he would be returning from France and going to Tregasal , and if they were still here , he might stop in again to see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be a pleasure to meet him again . Plainly , here was a proffer of friendship , and she decided that she would make the most of it . Here was the possible beginning of a flirtation which somehow had been a possibility in the back of her mind ever since she had learned that Stane was her landlord and possibly Cowperwood 's future partner . After he had gone , she recalled to her mind , dreamily , his long , lean figure , his perfect country tweeds , his handsome face , his hands , his eyes . He had an air , a walk , a manner , in which charm was implicit . But there was Cowperwood 's business with him , as well as the anomaly of her own and her mother 's position . Would he not guess ? He was no Colonel Hawkesberry or Arthur Tavistock to be deceived , along with all these country curates and spinsters . She knew better , just as she knew that neither she nor Cowperwood would have been deceived . And if now she made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would he not immediately proceed upon the basis that she was no better than she should be , one whom he could add to his list of experiences without thought of permanency ? Considering her affection for Cowperwood as well as her great interest in his future , she was not willing to even approximate a betrayal of this sort . Itp175would mean too much to him . And it was possible that there would be an angry reprisal on his part . She even debated the wisdom of consenting to see Stane again . However , early one morning in August , while she was posing Narcissus-like before her mirror , she did receive a message from Stane . He was leaving Paris , preceded by a groom with two of his horses en route to Pryor 's Cove , and would like , with her permission , to accompany them . She wrote him a note , saying that she and her mother would be delighted to receive him . And she was thereupon so thrilled that she began to question herself , thinking also of Cowperwood  --  who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lorna Maris . Stane , though less keen than Cowperwood in the realm of finance , was a worthy rival in that of affection . When greatly interested , he was aggressive and resourceful . He loved beautiful women , and whatever his other labors , was forever pursuing some new quest . On sight of Berenice he had conceived an emotional passion for her . He thought of her in that lovely setting , alone with her mother , as a fair target for his affections , but , because of Cowperwood , realized that he would have to step carefully . However , considering that Cowperwood had not even mentioned his ward , and she was his tenant , why should he not continue to call on her , at least until he knew more ? And so , when the time came , he packed with real gusto , determined to make as much of the occasion as possible . And on her part , Berenice was ready also . She was wearing her favorite gown of pale green and was less formal and more playful than before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which horse had won , the bay with the white circle around his eye , or the tall black one with the white stockings ? It was the tall black one , and he had won a 12,000 franc prize as well as some side bets , as much as 35,000 francs all told . " Enough to turn some poor French family into aristocrats , I suppose , " commented Berenice , lightly . " Well , the French are rather thrifty , you know , " said Stane . " It would certainly make an aristocrat of some of their villagers , and , of ours , too , for that matter . Up in Scotland , where some of my father 's ancestors come from , it seems to have laid the foundation for an earldom . " He smiled reflectively . " The first earl of my family , " he added , " began with less than that . "  | " And the present one ends with winning as much in a single race ! " " Well , this time , yes , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me almost twice that . " They were sitting on the deck of the houseboat , waiting for tea to be served . A punt , filled with idlers , went by , and he asked Bereniceif she had made use of either the canoes or punts in the boathouse . " Oh , yes , " she said . " Mr. Tavistock and I , and also Colonel Hawkesberry , who lives over near Wimbledon , have explored the river to Windsor in that direction and far beyond Marlow in this . We 've talked of going as far as Oxford . " " In a punt ? " queried Stane . " Well , two or three of them . Colonel Hawkesberry has been talking of arranging a party . " " The dear old colonel ! So you know him ? We knew each other as boys . But I have n't seen him in a year . He 's been in India , I believe . " " Yes , so he told me . " " But there 's far more interesting country around Tregasal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have the sea on all sides , and the rockiest coast in England , quite impressive ; besides moors and fens and tin and copper mines and old churches , if you care for them . And the climate is delightful , particularly now . I do wish you and your mother would come to Tregasal . There 's quite a good small harbor there , where I keep my yacht . We could sail over to the Scilly Isles ; they 're only about thirty miles away . " " Why , how delightful ! And how kind of you , " said Berenice , yet thinking of Cowperwood and what he might say , if he knew . " Mother , how would you like a yachting trip to the Scilly Isles ? " she called through the open window . " Lord Stane has a yacht and a harbor of his own at Tregasal , and he thinks we would enjoy it . " She rattled it off with an air of good humor , yet touched at the same time with the slightest trace of condescension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casual regard for an invitation which , in so many other quarters , would actually be prayed for . Mrs. Carter appeared at the window . " You 'll have to excuse my daughter , Lord Stane , " she said . " She 's a very wilful girl . I have never had any control over her , nor has anyone else that I knowp177of . Just the same , if I may speak for myself "  --  and here she looked at Berenice as if asking permission  --  " it sounds delightful . And I 'm sure Bevy thinks so , too . " " So now , tea , " ran on Berenice . " And then you can come and pole me on the river , although I believe I like the canoe better . Or perhaps we could walk , or we could play a game of squash before dinner . I 've been practicing , and I might be good at it . " " I say , it 's too warm for squash now , is n't it ? " protested Stane . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tennis court to quite anything else . The Empire must be decaying ! " But there was no squash that evening ; instead , a canoe trip on the Thames , and afterward a leisurely dinner by candlelight , Stane dwelling on the charms of Tregasal , which , as he insisted , while not so modern or so handsome as many another good house in England , commanded a view of the sea and the rocky coast that was strangely , almost eerily , impressive . But Berenice was still afraid to accept the invitation just then , although she was fascinated by his description of the place . BETWEEN Berenice and Stane there wasalmost a similarity of temperament . Like her , he was less rugged than Cowperwood and , to a degree , less practical . On the other hand , Stane being proportionately excluded from the practical realm in which Cowperwood shone , was more effectively radiant in that atmosphere which Berenice most enjoyed , that of an aesthetically controlled luxury . His taste and philosophy she absorbed in a few moments on their evening walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like Cowperwood , he was inclined to accept and even rejoice in his lot as he found it . He was wealthy . He was , after a fashion , gifted . He was tided . " But I have done nothing to earn or deserve anything that I have , " he admitted at one point . " I can believe that , " said Berenice , laughing . " But here I am , " he went on , pretending to ignore her interruption . " The world is like that , unfair , full of gifts for some and nothing for others . " " I do agree with you there , " said Berenice , suddenly serious . " Life seems to be shot through with crazy predestinations , some beautiful and some terrible or shameful or brutal . " Stane had then gone on to discuss his life . His father , he said , had wanted him to marry the daughter of a friend of his , also an earl . But , as Stane expressed it , there was not enough attraction between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to delay marriage on any terms until he had seen more of the world . " But the trouble is , " he said , " I seem to have fallen into the habit of travel . And , in between , there 's London , Paris , Tregasal , and Pryor 's Cove , when it is unoccupied . " " But what troubles me , " said Berenice , " is what a lone bachelor can do with all those places . " " They cater to my principal diversion , which is partying , " he answered . " There 's a great deal of that here , as you must have seen for yourself . You can hardly escape it . But also I work , you know , sometimes very strenuously . " " For the pleasure of it ? " " Yes , I think so . At least , it keeps me in countenance with myself , establishes a balance that I find to be healthy . " And he went on to develop his pet theory that the significance of a title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world 's interest was turning to men who worked in the realm of science and economics , and it was economics which most interestedhim . " But that 's not what I want to talk about , " he concluded , " but rather of Tregasal . It 's a little too distant and too bare for ordinary partying , thank goodness , so when I want a real crowd I have to do a little planning . Contrasted with all that goes around London , it 's very different , and I frequently use it as an escape . " Immediately Berenice sensed that he was pressing for a better understanding between them . It might be best , she thought , to end the matter at once , to make sure here and now that there would be no further development . Yet she resented the necessity for such action in the case of someone whose view of life seemed as broad as her own . She even speculated , looking at Stane as they walked , as to whether , in case she told him of her true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let his natural interest dominate and sustain his social courtesies . For , after all , he was now associated with Cowperwood financially and might respect him sufficiently to respect her also.  |p179At  the same time , there was this very real attraction toward him . She decided to postpone the conversation for that evening . But the following morning , and shortly after sunrise , it began again when they met for an early breakfast and horseback ride . For he insisted that he was running off to Tregasal not only to get a few days ' rest but also to be able to think clearly concerning some important financialmatters which were requiring his attention . " You see , I have let myself in for a lot of work in connection with your guardian 's underground plans , " he confided . " Perhaps you may know that he has a very complicated program , for which he seems to think he needs my help . And I am trying to decide whether I can be of any real use to him . " He paused as if waiting to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jogging close beside him , was strongly determined not to express herself in any way . And so now she said : " Mr. Cowperwood happens to be my guardian , but his financial goings-on are a mystery to me . I am more interested in the lovely things money can accomplish than I am in how it is made . " She gave him a wavering smile . Stane checked his horse for a moment , and turning to look at her , exclaimed : " My word , you think precisely as I do ! I often wonder , loving beauty as I do , why I bother with practical matters in any form . I am often at war with myself over this point . " And now once more Berenice began contrasting Stane with her aggressive and ruthless lover . Cowperwood 's financial genius and lust for power were tempered , to a degree , by his love of art and beauty . But Stave 's strongly developed aesthetic sense was dominant , and , besides , he likewise possessed wealth and personality , plus something Cowperwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significance of a distinguished title . The contrast was intriguing , since so obviously she was making a marked impression on Stane . English nobility as opposed to Frank Cowperwood , American financier and street railway magnate ! Riding under the trees on a dappled gray mare , she tried to think of herself as Lady Stane . They might even have a son , heir to the earldom of Stane . But then , alas , she thought of her mother , the notorious Hattie Starr of Louisville , and her own left-handed relationship with Cowperwood which might appear as a scandal at any moment . For there was Aileen , and possibly Cowperwood 's anger and subsequent antagonism , which , considering his genius for intrigueand revenge , could take any form . Her previous thrill vanished , mistlike , before the heat of reality . For a moment she fairly froze because of the complications of her dilemma , but a second later she was partly soothed by Stane saying : " Will you let me say that you are as brilliant and understanding as you are beautiful ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand gayly in response . " Why not ? Would you expect me to reject anything I do not deserve ? " Stane was still more intrigued , and so moved to think that the relationship between her and Cowperwood might be quite normal . For the man must be all of fifty-five or sixty ! And Berenice looked to be no more than eighteen or nineteen . Perhaps she was an illegitimatedaughter . On the other hand , was it not possible that actually , considering her youth and beauty , Cowperwood was hoping to intrigueher by gifts and attentions showered on her mother and herself ? For in studying Mrs. Carter , Stane had sensed something he could not easily explain . Obviously , she was the girl 's mother , since Berenice resembled her so closely . He was puzzled . But now he wanted to take her to Tregasal , and meditating on how to do this , he said : " One thing I must congratulate you on , Miss Fleming , and that is your possession of such a brilliant guardian . I find him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " And it 's interesting to know that you are co-operating with him , or thinking of doing so . " " By the way , " he said , " do you know when he will be returning from America ? " " The last we heard was that he was in Boston , " she replied . " And he had a lot of work to do in Chicago and other places . Really , I do n't know when he 's likely to return . " " When he does , perhaps I shall have the pleasure of entertaining you all together , " said Stane . " But there 's still Tregasal , you know . Will that need to wait on Mr. Cowperwood 's return ? " " Oh , I think so ; at least , for three or four more weeks . Mother is n't feeling well , and her principal desire at the moment is to stay here and rest . "  |p181She  smiled reassuringly at him while feeling at the same time that once Cowperwood returned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing might be arranged . Personally , she would like nothing better than to accept this invitation . And a friendship here , with Cowperwood'sapproval if not his presence , might further his affairs in connection with Stane . She would write Cowperwood at once . " But after three or four weeks , do you think it will be possible ? " asked Stane . " I 'm quite sure of it . And nothing would give us all greater pleasure , I assure you . " And Stane accepted the mixed offer with the best grace in the world . For , plainly , this young American beauty did not need him or Tregasal or his titled connections . She was a person in her own right , and was to be accepted only on her own terms . UNCERTAIN as Berenice was about thewisdom of developing this relationship , it was partially furthered by Cowperwood 's delay in returning . For already he had written , and this on account of Lorna , that until the approaching presidential election was over , he could not return to London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not very soon return , he would send for her to meet him in New York or Chicago . While this letter provoked speculation , it did not arouse any suspicions . And nothing would have come of it except for the clipping , mailed by Aileen , which arrived the week following Berenice 's conversation with Stane . Trifling over her mail in the east bedroom of the cottage one morning , she picked up a commonplace envelope addressed to her New York home and forwarded to her here . It containedpictures as well as descriptions of Lorna Maris , and an article clipped from Town Topics , which read : A tidbit of gossip now going the rounds relates to an internationally famous multimillionaire and his latest protegee , one of the dancing favorites of the hour . The item , as retailed , is romantic in the extreme . It sets forth how this gentleman , famed for his financial triumphs in a certain midwestern city as well as his penchant for young and beautifulmaidens , came across , in one of our outlying cities , the most beautifuland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and appears to have made an instantaneous conquest . As great as is the wealth of this Maecenas and his fame for extravagant expenditures or endowments on those who chance to attract his interest , she was not asked to retire from the stage and accompany him to Europe  --  from where he has recently returned in search of capital for his latest venture  --  butrather , because of his infatuation , he seems to have been persuaded to remain here . Europe calls , but the supreme financial adventureof his life has been halted , in order that he may bask in the glow of this latest luminary . Silk-hatted stage door Johnnies wait vainly while a private car whisks her away to such joys as we can only infer . The clubs , the restaurants , the bars are agog with talk of the romance . For its conclusion is dubious , and assuredly Europe can not be made to wait indefinitely . Veni , vidi , vici ! Berenice was at first more surprised than shocked . Cowperwood 's enthusiasm for her , as well as his seeming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lulled her into the notion that for the present , at least , she was safe . At the same time , as she studied the picture of Lorna , she was quick to perceive the sensual fire that markedly vivified this latest favorite . Was this true ? Had he , and so soon , found another ? For the moment , she could scarcely forgive the substitution . It had not been more than two months since he had avowed her the sum of the exquisite in womanhood , and that she , of all women , need not fear variability or competition . And yet , here he was in New York , with no honest reason other than Lorna to keep him there . And writing her this nonsense about the presidential election ! By degrees , she grew very , very angry . Her slate-blue eyes turned cold . But finally , reason came to her rescue . For was she not in possessionof drastic weapons of her own ? There was Tavistock , who , if a fop , was socially so secure that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were others : the glances and appreciative eyes of a score of signally important as well as attractive individuals in this , to her , newer world which plainly said : " Consider me ! " And , finally , there was Stane . But as hostile to Cowperwood as these first thoughts of Berenice might appear , there was in them no desperation . For after all , she cared for him . They both had seen how much of real value had already come to them through each other . She was nonplussed , hurt , startled , not a little angry but not defiantly so . Had she herself notp183often wondered whether it would be possible for an affection and temperament such as hers to withdraw him entirely from his old moods and ways ? She had admitted to herself , or half-believed , that she could not . At best her hope had been that this combination of their qualities and interests would be sufficient to hold both in a relationship that would be enticing , at least profitable . And now , was she going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that all had already failed ? Thinking of her own future as well as his , she was not willingto admit this . What had already been was far too wonderful . Already she had written Cowperwood in regard to Stane 's invitationand had been intending to await his reply . But now that this particular evidence was before her , and whatever her ultimate decisionin regard to Cowperwood might be , she decided to accept his lordship 's invitation , encourage his enthusiasm for her . And thereaftershe would decide what she would do about Cowperwood . She was especially interested to see what effect Stave 's manifested interestin her was likely to have on him . And so she now wrote Stane that since her mother had considerablyimproved and was in a state where a change would be good for her , she would be glad to accept his second invitation which had arrived a few days before . As for Cowperwood , she decided to stop writing him . And since she did not wish to compromise herself with Stane in any way , she would do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would be better to wait and note the effect of her silence on him . MEANWHILE , in New York , Cowperwoodwas seemingly still in full enjoymentof his latest passion , but in the background , and the very immediate background , at that , were thoughts of Berenice . As was almost always the case with him , his purely sensual enthusiasms were limited in duration . There was something in his very blood stream which , in due course , invariably brought about a sudden and , even to himself , almost inexplicable cessation of interest . After Berenice , however , he found himself troubled by a conviction that at last , and for the first time in his life , he was courting a loss which was not purely sensual and which , therefore , could prove not only aesthetically but mentally devitalizing . Alone among women , she had brought something besides passion and cleverness into his life , something sensitively involved with beauty and creative thought . And now , there were two other things which gave him pause . The first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter telling him of Stane 's visit to Pryor 's Cove and the invitation he had extended to her and her mother to visit Tregasal . This disturbed him very much , for Stane 's physical and mental charms were clear to him . And he had sensed that these would appeal to Berenice . Should he be done with Lorna at once and return to England to forefend against any inroads on the part of Stane ? Or should he linger a little longer in order to enjoy to the full his relationship with Lorna , and by so doing indicate to Berenice that he was not really jealous , could calmly brook so distinguished and competent a rival , and thereby persuade her to the thought that he was the more secure of the two ? But in addition there was another matter which complicated his mood . This was the sudden and most unexpected illness of Caroline Hand . Of all the personalities preceding Berenice , Caroline had been the most helpful . And her intelligent letters had continued to assure him of her unchanging devotion and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came word from her that she would shortly have to be operated on because of appendicitis . She desired to see him , if only for an hour or two . There were many things she wanted to say to him . And since he was back in this country , he might be able to come . Feeling it to be a duty , he decided to go to Chicago to see her . Now , in all of his life , Cowperwood had never been called upon to attend even so much as a slight illness in connection with one of his mistresses . They had all been such gay , youthful , passing affairs . And now , on his arrival in Chicago , to find Carrie , as he called her , suffering great pain and about to be removed to a hospital , was quite sufficient to cause him to meditate seriously on the tenuousness of human existence . One of Caroline 's objects in asking him to come to her was to seek his advice . For assuming that things did not turn out right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to see that certain wishes of hers were carried out . There was a sister in Colorado , with two children , to whom she wasp185devoted , and to whom she wished certain bonds to be transferred . These Cowperwood had advised her to buy , and they were now in trust for her at his New York bank . He was quick to belittle Caroline 's precautions against death at her age  --  he was twenty-five years her senior  --  while at the same time thinking it was possible . She might die , of course , as they all might die , Lorna , Berenice , anyone . And how really futile this brief strugglewhich at sixty he was entering upon with almost youthful enthusiasm , while Caroline , at thirty-five , was fearing that she would be compelled to relinquish it . Strange . Sad . Yet true enough , balancing her caution exactly , she did die within forty-eight hours after her entrance into the hospital . On hearing of her death , he felt it advisable to leave Chicago immediately , since locally she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before his departure , he sent for one of his Chicago lawyers and gave him instructions as to what was to be done . Just the same , her death preyed on his mind . She had been so gallant , so vivid , so witty , even , as she left for the hospital . The last thing she said before leaving the house , and after he had expressed his regret that he could not accompany her , was : " You know me , Frank , I 'm a darn good accompanist myself . Only do n't go away till I come back . There are still a few duets left in me . " And then she had not returned . And with her had gone one of the gayest of his Chicago memories , the time when he was in the midst of his great fight and had been able to snatch only moments with her . And now Caroline was gone . Aileen , too , was really gone , howevermuch she might seem to be near him . Haguenin was gone , as was Stephanie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How much more was there for him ? He had a sudden overwhelming desire to return to Berenice . However , getting rid of Lorna wasnot easy . For , like Berenice , or Arlette Wayne , or Caroline Hand , or any of a score of charmers of the past , she was not without her subtleties . And to have the great Cowperwoodas her attendant was something too flattering to be relinquishedwithout a struggle.  | " Are you going to be in London long ? Will you write me regularly ? Wo n't you come back for Christmas ? Or at least by February ? You know it 's settled we 're to remain in New York all winter . They 're even talking of going to London after that . Would you like it if I came over there ? " She was curled up in his lap and talking into his ear . She added that if she came to London , because of Aileen and his affairs there , she would be as unobtrusive as she had been in New York . But Cowperwood , thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was true that sensually Lorna was able to evoke a true delirium of the flesh , but socially , aesthetically and diplomatically , she was no match for Berenice , and he had begun to feel the difference . There must be an end , and a sharp one . In spite of his various letters and cablegrams subsequent to her letter regarding Stare 's visit and her half-indicated desire to go to Tregasal , he had not heard from Berenice . And so by degrees he was beginning to associate the item in Town Topics with her silence . His ever-telepathic mind had now decided not to write any more but to leave , and that instantly . Accordingly , one morning after a night with Lorna , and as she was dressing for a luncheon engagement , he began paving the way for his exit . " Lorna , you and I have to have a talk . It 's about this matter of our separating and my returning to England . " And without heeding such questions and objections as from time to time she chose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly as he could , but without mentioning Berenice by name . Yes , there was another woman . And his happy association with her was quite the most necessary and important thing in his life at this time . Besides , there was Aileen , and the nature of his affairs in London . There must be no thought on Lorna 's part that this relationship of theirs could go on indefinitely . It had been very beautiful . It still was . But . . . Despite Lorna 's comments and , at certain points , welling tears , it was as though a king were talking to his favorite but about to be discarded mistress . She sat chilled , wounded , and not a little overawedand outfaced . That such a swift end should be made of this was unbelievable . And yet , looking at him , she knew it was so . Forp187never , in all their hours together , had he once said that he deeply cared for her or that it would not end . He was not one to say such things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had not believed it possible that any man , even Cowperwood , once he had entered into this rich intimacy , could find it within his strength to leave her . How could he propose it ? Frank Cowperwood , her granduncle , really her own flesh and blood , and her lover ! But Cowperwood , dynamic , thoughtful , cold , the executioner as well as the lover , standing before her and saying that of course there was this blood tie , and because of that and his real affection for her there could be no final mental separation . But there would have to be a physical one . And so it was , except that during the several days in which . he was preparing to sail , there were more long conversations , in which she argued that he should continue to see her as a relative ; she would not in any way interfere with him . To which he replied that he would see . At the same time , however , his mind was continually on Berenice . His knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not leave him , but she might feel less obligated and so withdraw her intellectual and emotional support . And now there was Stane in the background . He must not delay , for unquestionablyshe was not dependent on him . He would have to make his peace with her as quickly as possible . After making all the necessary arrangements , and not before , he decided to tell Aileen that they were returning to London . And one evening , as he was entering his home preparatory to speaking to her , he met Tollifer just leaving . Cowperwood greeted him cordiallyand announced casually , after an inquiry or two relative to his doings in New York , that Aileen and he were returning to Londonin a day or two . This bit of information Tollifer clearly understoodmeant that he also would be sailing , and he was delighted . For now he could return to Paris , and probably Marigold Brainerd . But how easily and skilfully this man arranged things ! For at one and the same time he could have Lorna in New York and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aileen and himself to London or the Continent ! And all the while maintaining the same untroubled look that he had noted the first time he saw him . Whereas he , Tollifer , at news of this announced change , must proceedto disturb all his present arrangements in order to accommo- date and make possible and pleasant this other man 's brisk and dauntless progress through life ! MEANWHILE , during four days in lateSeptember , Berenice was being entertained by the picturesque and historic phases of Tregasal . Stane had arranged that his guests should include a jolly and interesting couple who lived on an adjoining estate , a Mr. and Mrs. Robert Waler ; also Warren Sharpless , the prosperous master of one of the very considerable fishing industries of the region , who had long since passed from the tradesman to the gentleman class . These three were to help entertain Mrs. Carter . And true to his explanation of himself , Stane impressed Berenice as being markedly inclined to place diversion on an equal footing with his considerable financial interests . In other words , he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of moorland which at different points led to woods or the slaty promontories and beaches of this westerly coast , Stane was full of enthusiasm for what his estate and county had to show . To Berenice , with whom he sought to be alone as much as possible , he pointed out the circles and lines of stone , possibly of Druidic or other early religious origin , which at certain spots lent a mysterious and plainly prehistoric atmosphere to his property . Also he talked to her of the copper and tin mines of pre-Roman days , and the great fishing fleets plying out of Mounts Bay , St. Ives , and Penzance ; and of the aged and primitive folk of some of the inland villages , some of whom , on his own estate , spoke a now almost forgotten language . In Mounts Bay lay his yacht , roomy enough , as she discovered , for the entertainment of a dozen guests . And from the topmost mount of Tregasal plateau could be seen both the English and St. George 's channels . Berenice noted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange country , almost as much so as of his possessions in it . Here he felt himself the lord that he was , recognized and respected by all . She wondered if presently a sobering process would not set in , which would bring him back to this region permanently . For her , however , it was not so enticing . A little too bleak and primitive , although she admired it as a spectacle . Tregasal Hall , long and gray andp189somber , was only saved in her esteem by its highly decorative interior . There were bright curtains and rugs , old French furniture , French and English paintings , and modern lighting and plumbing . Also she was impressed and even a little overawed by the library , collected by previous earls over a period of a hundred and fifty years and constituting an imposing bibliophilic treasure . Throughout this visit , which included a day of yachting and one of bathing and picnicking under the cliffs , Berenice was still further impressed by a certain rugged simplicity which contrasted oddly with Stane 's love of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he demonstrated by chinning himself more than half a dozen times on the limb of a tree . Also an excellent swimmer . He ventured far into the waves and breakers which Berenice could only contemplate with doubt and wonder . He questioned her constantly as to her reactions in regard to all that pleased him , and enthusiasticallywelcomed every suggestion of concordance , and was foreverbusying himself throughout her visit with suggestions of things they might possibly do at some future time . Yet charming as he was , and interesting at this time as a foil to Cowperwood and his unfaithfulness , still , as she decided , and after not a little meditation , he lacked the blazing force of Cowperwood . There was not about him that nimbus of great affairs and powers . He was more the quiet aspirant for position without the fascinating fanfare and uproar that seemed ever to accompany the great in the rush and flare of creation . And in this sense it was that Berenice was still , and always would be , dominated by Cowperwood . Although he was absent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by distance , still he filled her thoughts even at the very time that she found herself moved by the charm of the less strident and more soothing personality of Stane . For was it not possible that after all she might have to forego the fascination of Cowperwood and devote herself to the matter of bringing about an ultimate social rectification for herself by capturing Stane , or someone like him ? She could not deny her desire for at least some measure of security . She meditated on what Aileen might do to her once she found out she was in England , and with Cowperwood . Perhaps she did know . She was almost certain that Aileen had sent the Town Topics article . And her mother 's past life , how could that ever be hushed up ? And yet , there was no doubt of Stane 's affection for her . Perhaps if certain matters could be covered up , he would marry her . Perhaps , even if he knew all , he might still seek to aid her in concealing what was most inimical to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning toward Tregasal , after a gallop over his bleak acres , she wondered how stoutly based and centered in the customs of his class he really was , how much he might be brought to sacrifice to retain one for whom he really cared . LONDON . The usual fanfare because ofMr. and Mrs. Cowperwood having returned . Berenice , because of previous cables , fully aware of Cowperwood'sarrival , and he really interested in but one thing : peace and affection between himself and Berenice . And Stane very much pleased because in Cowperwood 's absence he had not only made some progress with the underground business but also with Cowperwood 's ward . In truth , Stane was half in love . He had been at Pryor 's Cove several times following Berenice 's Tregasal visit . And hope in connection with his affection was giving strength to the thought that he should persist in his quest . He might win . Berenice might fall in love with him and consent to become his wife . Cowperwood should not look too unfavorably on such a development . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , he would need to know more about Berenice and her true relation to Cowperwood . He had not troubled to investigate as yet . But even if he found her background not as perfect as it might be , Berenice was still the most fascinating woman he had ever known . She was certainly not attempting to lure him ; it was he who was definitely pursuing her . At the same time Berenice was at once pleased and troubled by two developments : one the fact that Stane seemed to be so very much interested in her , and the other that since her visit to Tregasal he had suggested , among other things , that she and her mother , together with the Cowperwoods , might join him for a cruise on his yacht , the Iola , before the end of autumn . The trip could include a stopover at Cowes , where King Edward and Queen Alexandra were likely to be at that time , and he would be glad to present them to their majesties , for both the king and queen were old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berenice experienced a mental chill . For if Aileen went on such a cruise , neither she nor her mother could go . If Aileen did not go , some accidentproof explanation would have to be made to Stane . If Cowperwood and she together were to accept this invitation , it would mean they would have to reach a diplomatic if not exactly harmonious agreement , and this was not exactly desirable to her at the moment . If she did not go with him , or went without him , it might mean the elimination of him from her life . And that again would mean explanations and readjustments probably fatal to all concerned . In the face of her present resentment toward Cowperwood , she was in no position to decide quickly . For dream as she might about Stane , it was quite obvious that without Cowperwood 's good will , she was not likely to extricate herself from the various complications which confronted her . Sufficiently angered , he could destroy her instantly . Sufficiently indifferent , he might allow Aileen and others to do as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mind she was confronted by the fact that her temperament as well as her general viewpoint appeared to crave Cowperwood and not Stane . She was strongest when supplemented by him . And weighing all that was to be weighed in connection with Stane , there remained the outstandingfact that he did not match Cowperwood in vigor , resourcefulness , naturalness , or the humanness of his approach to life . And it was these things more than anything else that caused her to realize that she desired to be with Cowperwood more than with anyone else , to hear his voice , to observe his gestures , sense his dynamic and seemingly unterrified approach to life . It was when he was with her that she felt her own strength magnified and without his brave support what would her personal reactions to all this now be ? It caused her , in the face of Stave 's suggestions , to indulge in no definitecomment other than that her guardian could , at times , be strangely perverse and intractable , and that she would be compelled to leave these invitations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time , as she smilingly indicated , she was very much in favor of it . And if he were willing to leave it to her , perhaps it could be arranged . A cheerful , if slightly formal , greeting from Berenice , which gave no least hint of difficulties , was waiting for Cowperwood when he reached his hotel . However , he was one who could not only sense danger but fairly register the vigorous thoughts of others in regard to himself , and he was already aware of inimical moods in her direction . In fact , long before he reached England , he had been fully convinced that his affair with Lorna was known to Berenice . He could feel it in the region of his solar plexus . It put him on his guard and sharpened his wits for any possible emergency . Already he had decided not to attempt evasion in any form , but , rather , feel his way according to Berenice 's mood and manner . And so , Pryor 's Cove , colored by the mood of autumn , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mist on the river , even at noon , the hour of his arrival . And as he drew near he was most vividly conscious of all the bright summer days he might have spent here with Berenice . But now the thing to do was to face her frankly ; let her once more sense him as he really was . That method had proved so propitious and effective in connection with other difficulties that he was satisfied to think it might prove so now . Besides , was there not Stane to balance Lorna ? Guilty or not , Berenice might be made to feel dubious in regard to her own position . As he drove in , Piggott , the gardener , visible behind a hedge he was trimming , bowed a greeting . In the paddock adjoining Stane 's stables , the horses were warming themselves in the autumn sun , and about the stable doors two of the grooms were busy with the harness . Mrs. Carter walked across the lawn to greet him , apparentlyunaware of the problems that were troubling him and her daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome , he guessed that Berenice had probably not confided in her . " Well , how 's everything ? " he called out to her , stepping forward and taking her hand . Berenice , according to her mother , was as well as ever , and now in the music room practicing . Rimski-Korsakov 's " Market Scenes " heard through the open window confirmed this . For a moment Cowperwood had the feeling that , as in the case of Aileen , he might have to seek her out and begin some sort of irritating explanation , but as he was so thinking , the music suddenly ceased and she appeared in the doorway , as poised and smiling as ever . Oh , he was back ! How nice ! How had he been ? Had he had a pleasant voyage ? She was so glad to see him . She ran forward , not kissing him , as he noted , but otherwise acting as though nop193least ill were troubling her . In fact , she appeared quite enthusiastic as she added that now he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this place seemed lovelier . And , for the moment , Cowperwood entered upon this play-acting the while he wondered how long it would be before the real storm broke . But since Berenice'sgaiety continued with an invitation to go over to the houseboatfor a cocktail , he interrupted with : " Let 's walk down by the river , do you mind , Bevy ? " And taking her by the arm he led her down to the tree-shaded path . " Bevy , " he began , " there 's something I have to say to you before we do anything else . " He fixed her with a hard , cold gaze . And as instantly she modified her manner . " Will you pardon me just a minute , Frank , while I speak to Mrs. Evans ... " " No , " he said , decisively , " do n't go , Bevy . This is something much more important than Mrs. Evans or anything else . I want to tell you about Lorna Maris . You probably know about her , but I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained silent , walking beside him softly and evenly . " You know of Lorna Maris ? " he asked . " Yes , I know . A clipping and some pictures were sent me from New York . She is very beautiful . " He noted her reserve . No complaint . No request for information . At the same time , all the more urgent was it that he should discoverher true mood . " Quite a sudden turnabout from all I 've been saying to you , is n't it , Bevy ? " " Yes , I think it is . But you 're not going to tell me you 're sorry , I hope . " The corners of her mouth suggested the least trace of irony . " No , Bevy , I 'm not going to tell you anything except what happened . Then you can judge for yourself . Do you wish to hear about it ? " " Not so much . But if you really want to talk about it , all right . I think I understand how it happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looking at her , admiration and genuine affection in his every line . " We ca n't  --  at least , I ca n't  --  get anywhere this way . The only reason I want to tell you is because whatever you 're thinking , I want you to know that I still care deeply for you . That may sound shallow and false after all that has happened since I last saw you , but I believe you know it 's true . You know and I know that there are personality values that are not to be measured by physical beauty or sexual sensations alone . As between one attractive woman and another , and one man and anotherjudging them , there are always other modifying things : character , understanding , extreme congeniality of purpose and ideals , and 91He paused as she interrupted rather icily : " Really ? Of sufficient weight to make a difference in one 's conduct , loyalty , or constancy ? " The semisubmerged flash in her eyes warned him that tergiversationin her case was of no least value . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You see me here , do n't you ? Ten days ago in New York ... " Berenice interrupted him . " Yes , I know . You left her after a delightful summer in her company . You had enough of her for the time being . And so London , your plans to re-establish yourself ... Her pretty mouth curled scornfully . " But really , Frank , you need not clarify all this to me . I am very much like yourself , you know . I can explain as cleverly as you can ; only being obligated to you for many things , and perhaps willing to sacrifice to a degree if I continue to need them , I must be more careful than you , much more careful . Or . . . " She paused and gazed at him , and he felt as though he had received a body blow . " But , Berenice , those things are true . I did leave her . I have returned to you . I am willing to explain or not , just as you please . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is to make up with you , get your forgiveness , go on and on with you alone . You wo n't believe it , but I promise you there wo n't be any more of this . Ca n't you sense that ? Wo n't you help me get back to some fair and equitable relation with you ? Think what we mean to each other ! I can help you , want to , will , whether you choose to break with me or not ! Wo n't you believe that , Bevy ? " They were standing on a small green lawn bordering the Thames , under old trees , with the low thatches of a distant hamlet in view and curls of blue smoke rising from cottage chimneys . All was peacefulabout them . But he was thinking that for all this sufficiency and the plain intention to make as little as possible of the provocationp195that had been given her , Berenice 's mood was not forgiving . At the same time , he could not help contrasting her with other women under related circumstances , Aileen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarreling woman . Although , as he now also thought , and for the first time in his life , real love , true love , howeverdestructive to the lover , might truly brood , weep , quarrel , and be forgiven for it , into the bargain ! On the other hand , here was certainly a type of affection which carried with it values which could not be denied or belittled . Plainly , he had dulled them , and on the instant he became the shrewd , watchful , resourceful , and dynamic Cowperwood of the financial meeting room and parley . " Listen to me , Bevy ! " he said , firmly . " About June twentieth I went down to Baltimore on a business matter . . . " And from there on he related exactly what had happened . The midnight return to his room . Lorna 's knock . All . He told exactly how fascinated he had been ; how and where he had entertained Lorna ; the comments of the critics . He persisted in the excuse that , like Berenice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no unfaithfulness . It was something that had come over him , and , to make himself perfectly plain , he advanced the theory which had come to him because of this and other related affairs in the past : that there was something in sensual desire which superseded and therefore must be superior to reason and will . For , in his case , it undermined and washed away any predeterminedcourse . " If I want to be honest , " he added at this point , " I must say that perhaps the only way to avoid lapses of this kind is to avoid any close contact with attractive women . And that is not always possible , of course . " " Of course not , " said Berenice . " As you know , " he went on , determined to continue , " once you are close to a person like Lorna Maris , you have to be pretty tame to escape her . And that 's a mighty strong admission from me . " " Quite , " said Berenice . " But I agree with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in connection with other men ? Are you ready to grant me the same privilege ? " She gazed at him inquiringly , while he stared at her in return . " Theoretically , yes , " he replied . " Because I care for you , I would have to stand for it emotionally as long as I could , as long as it was necessary for me to do so . After that , I would probably let you go , just as you will let me go if you do n't care enough to keep me . But what I want to know now is , knowing what you do , do you care , my dear ? And that is very important , because I still care a great deal . " " Well , Frank , you are asking me something which just at the moment I can not really answer , because I do n't know . " " But , as you see , " he persisted , " in this case her influence has not lasted , or I would n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excuse , but as a fact . " " In other words , " said Berenice , " she did not come on the same boat . " " She is dancing in New York the whole winter . And any Americanpaper will tell you that . I maintain , Bevy , that the attraction you have for me is not only stronger but superior . I need you , Bevy . We are two minds and temperaments that think and work alike . That 's why I 'm back here now , and want to stay here . This other affair was less valuable . I felt it all the time . When you stopped writing I realized how much less I cared for Lorna . There , that 's the sum of it . Now what , Bevy ? " In the growing dusk he had drawn nearer and nearer . Now he seized her , pressed his lips to hers , and held her tightly . As he did so , she felt herself yielding , mentally and emotionally . But at the same time she felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care for you , Frank , yes . But this is only a sensual pull in your case . When it is over . . . when it is over ... " Both subsided in each other 's arms , letting desire , emotion , blot out for the time being that frail tittle lamp , the human Mil  --  id ; and submerge for the moment hat wholly unreasoning force , the human will . LATER , in her bedroom , on that firstnight , Cowperwood continued his argumentas to the wisdom of going on together in their roles of ward and guardian . " You see , Bevy , " he said , " the relationship is already established in the minds of Stane and others . "  | " Are you trying to discover whether I am planning to leave you ? " she queried . " Well , naturally , I thought you might be considering it . This fellow Stane certainly has everything to offer you . " He was sitting on the edge of her bed . The room was only slightly illumined by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sitting up in bed , leaning against the pillows , smoking a cigarette . " Not so much as you have , " she said , " if you were ever really interested enough . But if you must know , I am not considering anything except the problem which you yourself have forced on me . We entered into an arrangement and you disarranged it . What do you expect me to do under the circumstances ? Give you every liberty and ask nothing for myself ? " " I do n't expect anything which is going to prove distasteful or harmful to you . " His tone was aggressive . " I 'm merely suggesting that if you 're going to become interested in Stane , we 'll have to figure out some way to continue this guardian-ward relationship until you are settled in your new state . From one point of view , " he added , honestly enough , " I 'd be glad to see you established as the wife of a man like Stane . On the other hand , there 's the program we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bevy , I can tell you frankly that I 'm not going to be very much interested . I might go on , and I might not . It will all depend on how I feel . I know you think that because I went with Lorna Maris I could easily make worth-while conditions for myself . But I do n't see it that way . She was a mere incident , something involved with the passions and not the mind , as I 've told you . If you had gone to New York with me , it never would have happened . Since it has , the one thing I see to do is to make the best working arrangement I can with you . And you will have to say what that is to be . " He got up and went to look for a cigar . Thus directly approached , Berenice found herself intensely troubled by all he had said . For she cared for him intensely ; his problems , his career , were almost more important to her than her own . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own future . For once she reached the age of thirty-five or forty , the chances of his being presentwere slight . She lay there silently thinking , while Cowperwood waited . And in due course she answered , although not without extreme misgivings . Yes , she would continue ; of course she would continue , for the present , anyway . For what could either he or she say in regard to his future movements or decisions ? " There 's no one like you , Frank , " she observed at this point , " for me , anyway . I like Lord Stane , of course , but I 've not really seen enough of him . It 's nonsense to even think of it . Just the same , he is interesting  --  fascinating , really . And if you 're going to leave me to a sort of half-life with you , it does seem impractical for me to ignore him , assuming that he would really marry me . At the same time , relying on you is not even to be considered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do my best to work out with you all the things we planned . But if so , it will be because I am relying entirely on myself . I will be making you a present of my youth , my ideals , my enthusiasms , and my love , and expecting not one thing in return . " " Bevy ! " he exclaimed , startled by the equity of her statement . " That is n't true ! " " Well , then , show me where it 's false . Let 's say I go on , as I probably shall ; then what ? " " Well , " said Cowperwood , seating himself in a chair opposite the bed , " I will admit you raise a serious question . I 'm not as young as you , and if you continue with me , you certainly run a great risk of exposure and social ostracism . There 's no denying that . About all I can leave you is money , and regardless of what we decide on tonight , I can tell you now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You will have enough , if you manage it intelligently , to maintain you in luxury for the rest of your life . " " Oh , I know , " said Berenice . " No one can deny that where you care for anyone , you are the soul of generosity . I am not even questioningthat . What troubles me is the lack of real love on your part , and the reasonable certainty that I 'm to be not only left without love but I am to pay for my own love in other ways later on . " " I see your problem , Bevy , believe me , I do . And I 'm in no position to ask you to do more for me than you feel you want to do . You must do what you think is best for yourself . But I promise you , darling , that if you do continue with me , I will try to be faithful to you . And if ever you feel you ought to leave me and marry someone , I promise not to interfere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I care for you very much , Bevy . You know that . You are not only my sweetheart but the same as my own child to me. "  | " Frank ! " She called him over to her side . " You know I can not leave you . It 's not possible , at least not in spirit . " " Bevy , darling girl ! " And he gathered her up in his arms . " How wonderful it is to have you with me again ! " " But one thing we must settle , Frank , " she put in at this point , calmly smoothing her ruffled hair , " and that 's this yachting invitation . What about that ? " " I do n't know yet , dear , but I guess as long as he 's so very much interested in you , he 's not likely to be particularly antagonistic toward me . " " Scamp ! " cried Berenice , laughing . " If ever there was a deep-dyed villain ... " " No , just a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an English financial jungle ! We 'll talk it over tomorrow . It 's you , just you , I want to think about now ... " LIKE a master chess player , Cowperwoodproposed to outwit all of the entirely nationalistic and , of course , humanly selfish elements arrayedagainst him in his underground project . He had evolved a broad and comprehensive plan , which he hoped to work out as follows : First , there was the existing Charing Cross line , to which must be added the existing central loop consisting of the District and the Metropolitan Railway , with their utterly impractical and warring factions . If all went well , he , Stane , and Johnson , but principally himself , held the key to this situation . Next , assuming that he gained control of the District and the Metropolitan  --  with which he would or would not , as circumstances dictated , join his Railway Equipment &; Construction Company  --  he proposed to organize the Union Traction Underground , Limited , which would control all of these . Incidentally , however , and unknown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy from Abington Scarr the charter for the Baker Street and Waterloo Line ; also the charter of the Brompton and Piccadilly , a line which he had learned was in about the same condition as the Charing Cross ; and certain other routes and prospects , charters for which he would pick up through others.  | With these in his bag , he would be able , he felt , to organize the London Underground General , which would include all of the property of the Union Traction Underground , Limited , as well as the charters and lines which he would privately acquire , thus providing a complete metropolitan system and at the same time , by reason of his holdings , give him personal control . Incidentally , if he could not ultimately take publicly the chairmanship of this enormousproperty , at least he would be acknowledged as its subsurface control . Also , if he could not put in his own directors , he would arrange so that those who were placed in control could do nothing to injure the property . And eventually , if all went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enormous profit , and thereafter leave the company to get along as best it could . He would have established his title as not only promoter but builder , and would have given London a modern and comprehensive metropolitan system which would bear the imprint of his genius , just as Chicago 's downtown loop bore it . And thereafter , with his wealth , he could maintain his art gallery , organize his charities , build the hospital to which he had given much thought in the past , and at the same time leave to all to whom he felt obligated an unquestionably satisfactory reward . The dream enticed him . A few years of swift work , five or six at the most , as he saw it , would serve to accomplish all . But to follow all of his activities , mental as well as physical , in connection with this plan would be the same as attempting to follow the swift and confusing thoughts , tricks , and motions of a prestidigitator . There were primarily , of course , his negotiations with Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his reconciliation with Berenice , he found a greater willingness to co-operate than had previously existed . Johnson announced that he and Stane had given a great deal of thought to the matter in Cowperwood 's absence , but he would prefer to communicate their conclusions in Stane 's presence . This resulted almost immediately in another conference in BerkeleySquare , where Cowperwood found something resembling more a friendly than a commercial atmosphere . Johnson had been detainedand was not present when he arrived . Immediately he noticed the joviality of Stane 's manner . The latter inquired about conditions in the United States : what the elections there forebode ;  |p201did  he find London pleasing ; and how was his ward , Miss Fleming ? And her mother ? He had been , as Cowperwood perhaps knew , a fairly frequent visitor to Pryor 's Cove . How truly charming they were , mother and daughter . He paused shrewdly , watching Cowperwood'sface as he said this . But Cowperwood met the challenge . " No doubt you are wondering about their relationship to me , " he said , suavely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years . She married a distant relative of mine , who named me as executor and guardian in loco parentis . Naturally , I have become very fond of Berenice . She is a very brilliant girl . " " I must say I find her so , " said Stane . " And I am pleased that Pryor 's Cove has appealed to Mrs. Carter and her daughter . " " Yes , they certainly seem to have found it an ideal place . It is really beautiful . " Fortunately , to break the personal trend of the conversation , Johnsonarrived at this moment . Bustling in and apologizing for having been unavoidably detained , he inquired after Cowperwood 's welfare before putting on his most officially expectant and executive manner . And there followed a concise and vigorous presentation by him of all that had been done , together with a review of the situation as it now stood . Decidedly , he announced , Cowperwood 's proposed invasion of the London underground field had evoked a furore . With but few exceptions , directors and shareholders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They seem to want to take over your ideas , Mr. Cowperwood , " he said , " and work them out themselves . The only thing that is delaying them is lack of agreement among themselves , and , of course , " he added , with a twinkle in his eye , " they are a little disturbed by the amount of money it is going to take . They do n't know how they 're going to get it without too much expense to themselves . " " Precisely , " commented Cowperwood , " and for that very reason delay will be the most expensive thing that can be indulged in . There is a program here which , if entered upon vigorously , can be held within attractive financial limits . Delay and argument will only attract speculators and prospectors who will pile up options on whatevershares or franchises are floating about and hold them for a rise . For that reason it is essential that we reach an agreement as quickly as possible . "  | " Now , as I understand it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposal was for Johnson and myself to pool our interests in the District as well as the Metropolitan , and in addition either buy , or bring together under some working agreement which you are to control , 51 per cent of either the District or the Metropolitan , or both . " " Right ! " said Cowperwood . " And against that , either on a hundred-year lease or in perpetuity , you agree to guarantee interest at 5 per cent . " " Right ! " " And , in addition , give the refusal of at least ro per cent of the preferred shares of the Charing Cross , together with ro per cent of the shares of any additional subsidiary which you or the larger company may see fit to organize and join up with the parent company , at 8 per cent of their par value . " " Right ! " " The interest on all these shares to be a first lien on the property of the entire company at the time it is fully organized . " " That is my proposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see nothing wrong with that , " said Stane , staring at Johnson , who in turn stared back at him . " In short , " said Johnson , turning to Cowperwood , " once we performour part , you bind yourself to reconstruct and equip in the most modern fashion both of the old lines and such new ones as you can secure , and to mortgage the entire property in such a way as to guarantee the interest on all of the present shares of the District and the Metropolitan , also on whatsoever amount of the io per cent of the shares of these new companies or subsidiaries we may elect to subscribe for at eighty . " " Such is my intention , " said Cowperwood . Once more Johnson and Stane stared at each other . " Well , " said Stane , finally , " subject to such difficulties as we are certain to encounter , I pledge myself to perform my part of the undertaking as quickly as possible , and to the best of my ability . " " And I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in entire harmony with Lord Stane , and to do whatever is necessary to bring this to a successful conclusion . " " Well , gentlemen , " said Cowperwood , rising , " I am not only pleased but honored by this understanding , and to show you thep203soundness of my intentions , I propose  --  if both of you are agreeable to the idea , of course  --  to ask Mr. Johnson to act as my legal advisor , and have him prepare all papers concluding this general agreement between us . And when the time comes , " he added , smiling at them , " I would be delighted to have you both serve as directors . " " As to that , time and circumstances will have to decide , " said Stane . " It should be helpful , certainly . " " It will be my pleasure to serve both of you to the very best of my ability , " added Johnson . All three were not a little conscious of the grandiose note that had slipped into these mutual felicitations , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parting glass of old cognac  --  a case of which , without any previous mention , he had sent to Cowperwood 's rooms at the Cecil . ONE of the painful phases of Cowperwood'sfurther negotiations at this time was the need he faced , or thought he did , of employing Englishmen rather than Americans as his assistants in all departments of his work . De Sota Sippens was the first victim , and he was almost brokenhearted , for he had come to like London . Joined with his ever-successful Chief , as he argued , he expected to shine here . More than that , he was eager to sharpen his wits and energies against those of these assured and almost condescending Englishmen , who , he was perfectly satisfied , knew nothing about the business of traction . However , to soften the blow as much as possible , Cowperwoodplaced him in charge of his Chicago financial affairs . One of Cowperwood 's methods of raising capital was the use of the holding company , an underlying organization which would bring in sufficient money to buy the companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnish him with the necessary shares for that control . In this instance , his Railway Equipment &; Construction Company was formed , with dummy directors and chairmen , and in which all who joined him were eventually to possessfounder 's shares . Johnson acted as solicitor and counsel at a salary of  --  3,000 a year . And thereafter , in a private agreement drawn by him  --  but most carefully gone over by Cowperwood 's attorneys  --  and signed by Johnson , Stane , and Cowperwood , it was stipulated that from then on their various shares in both the District and the Metropolitan , either then and there owned or subsequently to be acquired , were to be voted as one in any official vote that looked to the reorganization and sale of the District and the Metropolitan to the new company later to be organized . And in this new companythey were to receive three shares of its issue for each one of their old shares . And now , for Johnson , there was the really great task of running about in quest of blocks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which shares , up to  --  500,000 he had orders from Cowperwood to buy , but under various names . Also to work up , among the old directors , knowledge of as well as enthusiasm for Cowperwood and his proposed plans . As for Stane , he was to buy as many more shares of these old companies as he could obtain , with a view to voting with Cowperwood in his new undertaking , and he , too , where possible , was to bring his personal influence to bear on all such as he knew . As a result of these activities , a veritable landslide of investors descended upon Cowperwood . And many American as well as Englishfinanciers , realizing the importance of the properties which he was gathering in , now also attempted to get franchises for themselves , which franchises by that time were most difficult to obtain . One of those who became interested was no less a person than StanfordDrake , also an American financier , who made applications to Parliament for franchises for lines which , if built , would have paralleledthe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practically split the income for these territories . This disturbed Cowperwood not a little , for it had to be stopped without arousing English opposition to both men , since the English were opposed to American entrance into this field , whether it be the entrance of Mr. Drake or Mr. Cowperwood . In consequence , the usual legal battles on the part of each ensued . For each pointed out the assumed defects of the other and each minimized the import of what his rival was trying to do . For his part , Cowperwood pointed out that the Drake line as planned would run , in part , through fairly good residence sections , but it would also be compelled to run through open fields for a distance of ten miles before it would reach paying territory . He alsop205pointed out that the Drake line was to be a single-track line , one track in a tunnel , while his system would be double-track throughout . At the same time , the Drake interests proceeded to counter with the claim that Cowperwood 's roads were under the Thames embankment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that Mr. Cowperwood 's roads were away from trade , and theirs would take people to trade . However , Cowperwood added that parallel lines were mutually destructive , did not pay , for he knew if the Drake crowd succeeded in getting franchises for their system , no matter how it was developed , his own line would be affected to a considerable extent . This , of course , he did not admit at the time ; instead , he announced that he could not understand why the House of Drake would indulge in any such venture . And to make matters as smooth as possible , he said he believed that Mr. Drake 's London branch , rather than Mr. Drake himself , was responsiblefor the error . He went on to say further that Mr. Drake was a great man , and he believed eventually , when the matter was made clear to him , he would not put any money into it . Yet in spite of all these sweet words , Mr. Drake 's lawyers , going before Parliament , introduced a bill seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rival bill for the lines he wanted to build . The result was that Parliament put both bills off until the following November and did not favor either one , which delay was a kind of victory for Cowperwood , he being so much further ahead in the development of his over-all scheme . In fact , he was heard to say that he did not enjoy going into any project unless there was some opposition , and , as everything was fair in love and war , he was prepared to oppose the Drake interests to the last ditch . But the interest of Stanford Drake was aroused to the necessity for a real battle with Cowperwood . Having vast funds at his disposal , he made Cowperwood an offer of $5,000,000 for the privilege of sharing the Piccadilly Circus Station , which belonged to Cowperwoodand which would obviously be needed by Drake in his system . At the same time he also offered Cowperwood $2,500,000 if he would call off his army of lawyers who were then and there preparing to fight Drake 's application to Parliament for permission to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were refused by Cowperwood . At the same time there was the London United Company which was planning to build a road from Hyde Park Corner to Shepherd 's Bush , the preliminary negotiations for which they had worked out . They went to Drake and offered to unite their line with his , and asked for a franchise from the city . They also asked Drake to operate the line as a whole if and when completed . Drake refused . Then they asked to be permitted to operate their section . Again Drake refused . Whereupon they offered their section to Cowperwood , although they had as yet no franchise for it . Cowperwood notified them to see Speyer &; Company , a financing concern that operated not only in England and America but throughout Europe . This firm , after looking into the matter and seeing that they might , by benefiting Cowperwood , eventually benefit themselves , decided to buy all the existing rights which this particular company owned , after which they proceeded to syndicate the entire block of shares . Their counsel , then and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to withdraw their request for a franchise . As Drake had been pleading for only one total franchise for a year , this invalidatedthe whole plea . Drake returned with a request to be allowed a franchise for their section . But as their original request had called for no such thing , and there was no such bill before the committee , Cowperwood 's counsel argued that the whole matter must be thrown out . And Mr. Drake 's scheme was withdrawn . The dramatic conclusion of this fight between two such outstandingadversaries was reported in detail by both English and American newspapers , and the London County Council , which favored a system of transit development which would make travel convenient for all London , enthused over the victory of Mr. Cowperwood , citing him as a man of broad and valuable social qualities which deserved a most favorable reception everywhere . Cowperwood , taking advantage of this sentiment , made much of the social benefits that would result from his vast enterprise . His system , he announced , would ultimately carry as many as 200,000,000 passengers a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five-cent fare , and be a fully connected system which would enable a traveler to go all the way by subway , thereby providing an object lesson in rapid transit , cheap fares , and frequent service . Personally , at this time , Cowperwood was prospering so enormouslythat he was able to attend to matters other than those concerning the gathering of shares and profits . For instance , for merep207publicity purposes , he bought Turner 's painting , " Rockets and Blue Lights , " for $78,000 , and hung it in his office . For all of his success , however , there was a new and difficult situation arising in connection with Aileen that was about to descend on Cowperwoodwith full force . Aileen had returned to Paris and was again being entertained and amused by Tollifer and his friends . The fact was , however , that Marigold Brainerd , noting that Aileen favored Tollifer to such an extent that she might even wish to marry him eventually , decided that it was time for her to check this growing interest . Aware of his connection with Cowperwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear the field for her . For Tollifer had confessed as much to her one night on the yachting cruise , when he had had too much to drink . And accordingly at her first opportunity she acted . It was at a party that Tollifer gave at the studio of one of his friends , a celebration in honor of their return to Paris , that Marigold , having consumed more than her share of alcohol and noting how gayly Aileen was trifling with Tollifer , suddenly turned on her . " If you knew as much as I do about your friend , you might not be so eager to have him at your heels all the time , " she said , sarcastically . " Well , if you know anything that is so certain to annoy me , " said Aileen , " why do n't you come out with it instead of insinuating ? Or is it just your jealousy that is getting the best of you ? " " Jealousy ! Me jealous of Tollifer and you ! I happen to know what 's back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's all ! " . Startled and irritated by this sudden assertion , Aileen exclaimed : " Just what are you driving at ? Come on , tell me ! Otherwise , turn your jealousy on someone else ! " " Jealousy ! How silly ! I 'm sure it never occurred to you that your attentive friend might be pursuing you for reasons other than your personal charm . And besides , where do you suppose he gets all the money that he spends on you ? I 've known him for years , and he 's never had a shilling of his own , you know . " " No , I did n't know . But please come out with what you want to say , " said Aileen.  | " I suggest that you ask Mr. Tollifer , or , better yet , your husband . I 'm sure he could enlighten you , " concluded Marigold , as she edged away from Aileen . Whereupon , intensely wrought up , Aileen left the room , got her wraps , and returned to her apartment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tollifer ! The peculiar energy with which he had thrust himself into her life ! Penniless , and yet spending so much money ! And why Cowperwood 's willingness to encourage this friendship between them , even occasionally crossing over to Paris to attend these parties given by Tollifer ? The darkest aspect of Marigold'ssuggestion suddenly struck her with great force : that he had used this man to clear her out of his life ! She must get to the bottom of this ; she must know . Within the hour , Tollifer , having missed her at the party , called her on the telephone , whereupon she demanded that he come to see her at once , there was something she must discuss with him immediately . And , upon his appearance , a stormy scene . Whose idea was it that he should invite her to Paris and pay her so much attention and at the same time spend so much money on her ? Her husband 's or his own ? What nonsense ! Why should he spend money on her if he did not care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard that he had no money of his own , and never had had any . And , come to think of it , what did he really do to earn money , unless it was for service of some personal nature , such as that of dancing attendance on those who were able to spend their time playing but would not trouble to bother with all the tiresome details ? This was an insult that cut him to the bone , since it placed him in the servant class . " That 's not true , " he said , weakly . But there was something in the tone of his voice that made Aileen doubt him , and this awakened a fury in her . To think that any man should stoop to such degrading employment ! To think that she , Frank Algernon Cowperwood 's wife , due to her husband 's plotting , should be the victim of it ! To be thus publicly displayed as an unwantedwife , one so distasteful to her husband that he had to hire help to get rid of her ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the latest , she would show this parasite and trickster , and also her husband , that she was not to be disgraced in this fashion ! For here and now , Tollifer'sp209services , as far as she was concerned , were ended . And Cowperwood was to learn by wire that she was aware of his plotting , and that she was through with him forever ; that she was returning to New York to stay in her own home , where she belonged , and that if he attempted to follow her , she would take him into court and expose him in the public press ; she would relieve herself once and for all time of his lies , infidelities , and his mental cruelties ! After which , turning to Tollifer , she exclaimed : " You may go now . Your services to me are ended . I 'm returning to New York at once , and if you ever cross my path or annoy me in any way , I 'll see that you are exposed for what you are . Run to Mr. Cowperwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectableto do ! " With which she walked to the door and opened it for him to depart . AT THE same time that all of this washappening to Aileen in Paris , Berenice , still at Pryor 's Cove , was finding herself the object of a truly surprisingseries of social invitations , introductions , and successes which were far beyond anything she had anticipated . And while she felt she must credit a good portion of this success to Cowperwood , a greater portion , as she well knew , was due to Lord Stane 's infatuationand his desire to introduce her to his circle of very important social connections . With Aileen in Paris , Cowperwood had decided it would be safe to accept , for Berenice and himself , the invitation to cruise on Stane 's yacht , the Iola . Among the guests aboard were Lady Clifford , of Chadleigh , whose husband had one of the oldest titles in England ; the Duchess of Marlborough , one of Stave 's most intimate friends as well as one of the Queen 's favorites ; and Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the Iola eventually anchored at Cowes , Stane informed his guests that he had had word that the Queen was there and would be pleased to receive him and his friends for tea that afternoon : an announcement which aroused intense excitement in all of them , particularly Berenice , who had been nervously sensitive as to the possi- ble publicity that might follow from this . The Queen was exceedinglygracious and appeared herself to enjoy this informal visit . She evinced a particular interest in Berenice and made various inquiries , which , if Berenice had answered them truthfully , might have resulted in great injury to herself , but since she did not , resulted in the wish , expressed by the Queen , that she might see more of her in London ; in fact , that she hoped she would be free to attend her next Court reception . This courtesy on the part of the Queen all but startled Berenice , yet gave her still greater assurance as to what she could achieve for herself , if she wished . As for Stane , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time , its effect on Cowperwood was to cause him even more misapprehension as to Stave 's possible influence on Berenice . But there was even greater cause for worry on his part awaiting him on his return to his hotel suite in London . There was the letter from Aileen , mailed to him just before she sailed for New York , and which read as follows : At last I know the truth about my humiliating position in relation to your servant , Tollifer , and yourself ; your shameful employment of him in order to be rid of me and leave you free to go your customary libertine way . What a reward for all my years of devotion ! However , do n't worry , for you are free to go now , to run with your prostitutes where and when you will . For today I am leaving Paris for New York , where I expect to be finally free from your infidelities and indulgences . I warn you not to follow me . If you do , I will take you and your present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London and New York . AILEEN . On receiving this , Cowperwood devoted considerable time to the contemplation of the possible angles and results of this savage indictmentof himself . It seemed to him to be the better part of wisdomto return immediately to New York and see what , if anything , he could do to avoid a public scandal . However , closely connected with this was the position of Berenice . For if Aileen proceeded to do as she threatened , Berenice 's future would be greatly injured . And that he did not wish to have happen , at any cost . His first move , therefore , was to go at once to see Berenice , whom he found in a cheerful and highly ambitious mood . But once he told her of Aileen 's latest attack , and the nature of her threats , he could tell by her sudden change of expression that she looked upon it as ap211serious matter . She was interested to know what could have persuadedTollifer to confess his position . " Surely , he had everything to gain by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't understand the Lady Aileen , dear , " responded Cowperwood , ironically . " She 's not a person who thinks problems through to their ultimate conclusion . Instead , she develops a rage that does more harm than good to herself and everyone concerned . In fact , she can become so violent as to sweep anyone into confessions equally disastrous to both . The only thing I can think of doing at this time is to return to New York by the fastest boat , and maybe get there first . In the meantime , I have already wired Tollifer to come to London at once , because by continuing his employment I can easily arrange with him to say nothing . But I 'm wondering what suggestionsyou might have to make , Bevy . " " I agree with you , Frank , " she said . " I think you should return to New York as soon as possible , and see what you can do to placate her . After you talk to her , she 's very likely to realize how futile an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , she has known of me before this , and others also , " and here she smiled an ironic smile . " And you certainly are the one to tell her that . After all , you have n't done her any harm in this instance . Nor has Tollifer , for that matter . In fact , you 've provided her with the best guide to the pleasures of Paris that anybody would want , and , incidentally , you might also make clear to her that your work over here has taken every moment of your time . After all , it seems to me that could hardly fail to have some ameliorating effect . The papers are full of your labors and achievements , as you could point out to her "  --  a burst of wisdom which was by no means lost on Cowperwood . His one grief , as he now declared , was that it was he , not Stane , who had to go . " Never mind , dear , " she said , consolingly , " you 're too great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positively you will return triumphant , as usual . And you know I will be with you all the way , " and she put her arms around him and smiled up into his face with deep affection . " If that is so , then I know everything will be all right , " he said , confidently.  | BEFORE sailing for New York , Cowperwoodtalked with Tollifer , who demonstratedto him his personal innocence in connection with this development ; also that as far as he was concerned , his lips were sealed and would open only to say whatever Cowperwood desired him to say . Five days later , landing in New York , Cowperwood was met by a brigade of newspapermen with enough inquiries to fill a small catalogue . Was he after more money to buy more London subways , or was it for the purpose of disposing of his remaining American street railway holdings ? What paintings had he purchased in London ? Was there anything to the story that he had just paid $78,000 for Turner 's " Rockets and Blue Lights " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay a certain artist $20,000 for his portrait , and on its completion sent the artist $30,000 instead ? And also , by now , what did he think of English business methods ? All of this caused him to realize that while there was more interest in him as a public figure than had ever previously been manifested , as yet there was no trace of scandal in connection with him . Accordingly , he was more inclined to answer the questions , at least as many as it was diplomatically possible for him to answer without injury to himself . According to him , everything was progressing smoothly in London . In fact , he was justifiably proud , since he expected to have the London Underground electrified and in operation by January of 1905 . Also , it would have an $85,000,000 capital and one hundred and forty miles of track . And it was also true that he was now building the largest electrical power plant in the world , and when it was completedLondon would have the finest underground in the world . As to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude toward large business projects , such as his , superior to the American attitude ; that is , the English appeared to understand the importance of a great constructive program , and when they granted a franchise , it was not for a limited time , but granted in perpetuity , which gave men with large creative purposes an opportunity to build things lasting . As to paintings , yes , he had purchased several since being in Newp213York last , and those he was bringing back with him , a Watteau , a Sir Joshua Reynolds ( portrait of Lady O'Brien ) , and a Frans Hals . And yes , he had paid the artist in question $30,000 for his portrait when he needed to give him $20,000 only . But the artist had returned the $30,000 to him with the request that he contribute the sum to a charity  --  which caused a gasp of surprise from the reporters . The significance of such data as this , blazoned as it was in all of the newspapers , did not fail to impress Aileen , who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Notwithstanding her anger , she was moved to meditate on the wisdom of her original plan . What was to become of these paintings that he was purchasing ? For she recalled that recently he had spoken of the possibility of enlarging the New York mansion with a view to housing additional art objects . If so , her exposure of him and a threatened divorce suit might force him to change his plans in favor of one other than herself : the same dilemma which some years before she had faced and lost . But , accepting her threat at its face value , Cowperwood thought it best , during his stay in New York , to make his headquarters at the Waldorf-Astoria instead of the Fifth Avenue residence , and having once settled there , he took up the matter of trying to reach Aileen by telephone , with no success . For she had made up her mind not to allow him to come and discuss his , to her , seemingly inexcusable crime , and she had even gone so far as to request a New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers , which continued to report his doings , evoked in her , from hour to hour , a change of emotions . For , naturally , she was proud of his success , and yet she was jealous , because she was satisfied that somewhere , lurking in the background , was one of his mistresses  --  Berenice , no doubt  --  who was undoubtedlysharing this most iridescent period of his life . For Aileen loved show and glitter . At times she was almost childishly arrested by any startling phase of publicity concerning Cowperwood , good , bad , or indifferent . In fact , one newspaper picture of the immense electrical plant he was building in London so fascinated her as to make her almost forget her ills . On the other hand , when he was savagely attackedin one newspaper article , she could not help resenting it , at the same time that she was moved to attack him herself . After contemplating the immense variety of opinions and applause which greeted his return , Aileen 's rage became confused with a certaindegree of admiration , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calmly walked into the living room of her suite to find her lying on a chaise longue , the floor about her littered with newspapers which she had obviously been reading . She jumped to her feet on his entrance , trying to arouse in herself her treasured anger as he stood facing her . " Well , I see you keep up with the news , do n't you , dear ? " he commented , smiling a broad , free smile . " It is n't so bad , is it ? " " You ! " she almost screamed . " The effrontery ! If they only knew you as I do ! The hypocrisy of it all ! The cruelty ! " " Now , listen , Aileen , " he went on , as calmly as he could , " you know , if you stop to think about it , I have n't injured you in any way . If you 've read any of these papers , you know I 've been working almosttwenty-four hours a day on this proposition ever since I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what better guide could a personhave in a city like Paris ? If I remember correctly , in the old days you never passed through that city with me without complaining bitterly because I could n't spend all my time with you visiting places you considered interesting but which I had no time for . And so , when Tollifer showed up , and was going to Paris anyhow , I thought , since you appeared to like him , that your going there at the same time might give you the opportunity of satisfying your old desire to see Paris without having me about to interfere in any way . And that 's the only reason for Tollifer , and you know it ! " " Lies , lies , lies ! " cried Aileen , savagely . " Always lies ! But this time they wo n't work . At least , I can let the world know what you really are , and how you 've treated me . The articles about you will read a little differently then , you can bet ! " " Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know that from a material point of view I have never deprived you of anything you wanted , and all along I have been counting on you to take charge of my affairs after I 'm gone . This house here , of which you certainly are proud . As you know , I 've been planning to add to it in a way that will make it even more beautiful . For some time now I 've wanted to buy the house next door , in order to enlarge the palm room for you and make an additional gallery for pictures and statuary . I was intending to leave it all in your hands , to express yourself as you pleased . " But true to his natural secretiveness , he failed to state that before leaving London he had already purchased the house in question.  | " Why not get Pyne and let him submit some plans , " he continued , " and we 'll look them over . " " Oh , yes , " said Aileen , wistfully , " that would be interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my life being separate from yours , Aileen , that 's a ridiculous idea , really . In the first place , we 've been too long together , and although we have had our troubles , here we are . Outside of my work , which makes strenuous demands on me physically , my personal life is nothing . Besides , I am no longer young , and if you care to make friends with me again , once I get this London underground off my hands , I 'll really be glad to return to New York and live with you here . " " Do you mean me with six others ? " she asked , sarcastically . " No , I mean just what I said . I should think you could see that I may have to retire some day . If so , it will be for peace and quiet , and not more work . " Aileen was now getting ready to make an additional ironic comment , but looking up at him she caught a particularly weary and almost depressed look on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this caused her mood to alter from one of criticism to one of unexpected sympathy . Perhaps he was tired and needed rest , for he was getting along in years and had so much to do : one of the kindest thoughts she had experienced in connection with him for years . At this point , however , her maid came in to tell her that Mr. Robertson , her lawyer , was on the telephone , at which she stirred uneasily , and then said , rather defiantly : " Tell him I 've gone out ! " The import of this was not lost on Cowperwood . " Have you said anything to anybody about all this ? " he asked her . " No , I have not , " she replied . " Good ! " said Cowperwood , genially . And after explaining that various financial matters made it necessary for him to go to Chicago for a few days , he succeeded in extractingfrom her a promise not to do anything until he returned . For by that time , as he now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mutual satisfaction . Since she seemed satisfied to let the matter rest for the present , he took out his watch and remarked that he had just enough time to catch the train ; he would see her again on his return . And , calmedp216down considerably by this time , she accompanied him to the door , and then returned to consult the newspapers which previously she had been reading . THE visit to Chicago was importantenough , involving , as it did , negotiationsfor a loan or investment of $5,000,000 . And then there was Sippens to see for a report as to the gradual disposal of his real estate holdings . Another matter that required his attention was a recent lawsuit against one of the large traction companies of Chicago , which , several years before , had taken over two of the elevated lines which Cowperwoodhad originally built and operated . However , once he had withdrawn from Chicago and gone to London , these lines , due to poor management , had not only lost the income that previously had flowed from an excellent public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had wiped out all interest on stocks still held by investors . In fact , it was locally asserted that nothing in the history of public service corporations had shown such an utter collapse as this particular traction company . And since this loss was blamed on Cowperwood , it had become necessary for him to make clear to investors that the fault was not his , that it was due to mismanagement by those who had taken over the property : a clarificationthat later caused him to be called a " financial wizard " instead of a " sharper , " because at the time he had operated the lines it was a well-known fact that he paid an 8 to 12 per cent dividend on stocks in his company . So now , in addition to securing the $5,000,000 he had come to borrow , he left with his reputation greatly enhanced . However , there was one unexpected incident in connection with this Chicago trip , and that was the reappearance of Lorna Maris , who , because of newspaper notices of his presence in the city , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her . But this thought of hers was doomed to disappointment , because his mood had changed for the time being , and he was anxious to get back to New York , and , eventually , to Berenice . Noticing , however , that her clothes reflected a less successful state of affairs than when he had last seen her , he was moved to inquire into her life , and finding that herp217popular appeal had shrunk and her income also , he did pretend an interest in her welfare , and assured her that he would arrange a stable drawing account for her , and furthermore would see what he could do toward interesting a theatrical producer in her career : a series of favors which effectively rekindled her original courage and gaiety . But once he was aboard the train and it had begun to move past Lorna as she stood on the platform waving a final and wistful farewell , he could not help thinking on the changeful crisscross pattern woven by all creatures and forces . For here he was , being attacked by these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily press , as well as Aileen in New York , and , for that matter , the beautiful Berenice in London , who , reasonably enough , did not trust him any more than did Aileen . And yet , for what reason ? Emotions , sensual predilections , reactions to other types of human beings , which were not of his invention or creation . Clack , clack , clack ! went the wheels on the rails . To-h000 ! Tooh000 ! the whistle of the engine . And a level landscape flowing , not unlike time , past the window through which he gazed , reflecting dreamily on life , time , and change . WHEN Cowperwood went to see Aileenin New York on his return , he met with a pleasant surprise , for since he had been away she had been thinking about the value of his suggestions in regard to possible enlargement of the house , and his expressed desire to consider her taste in regard to the alterations . This had pleased her beyond anything he could have said . Consequently , she brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already she had had prepared by the architect and now wished him to examine . He was pleased to see that Raymond Pyne , the American architect who had designed this mansion in the first place , had produced a series of sketches of proposed changes which harmonized the old house with the new . Aileen emphasized the fact that she liked this , that , and the other phase of artistic interpretation . And deciding that he would see Pyne and advise him to take his time in the matter , he finally left her with the feeling that she was to be importantly em- ployed in connection with something that would not only reflect their joint artistic tastes but might well bring about their social reunion . Nevertheless , adjusting himself to New York and America at this time was not an easy matter for Cowperwood . His social viewpoint , since going to London , had changed . It was not that the English were less shrewd or sharp in their efforts to advance their own interests . But , as he had noticed since encountering Stane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconscious consideration of the need of interweaving rest or pleasure with their commerce and trade , whereas here at home , business was business , as the phrase ran . Ever since his arrival in New York there had been nothing but business dealings . There seemed to him nothing else interesting to do here , and it was because of this that his mind was constantly returning to Berenice and Pryor 's Cove , although he still found it necessary to visit all of the cities he had listed as sources for capital  --  hurried trips all over the east that left him feeling more or less exhausted . For the first time in his life he began to think rather than feel that he might be getting old . Satisfactorily enough , however , this situationwas finally relieved by the arrival of an urgent cable from Johnson , which said that owing to the activity of various pressure groups , his presence was of paramount import . He showed the cable to Aileen , and after she had read it she commented on the weariness which showed in his face and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was of prime importance , and , if possible , he ought to wind up his European affairs and retire . He replied that he had already been thinking of that , and in order to make it easier for her in his absence had appointed Mr. Cuthbert to take charge of his entire art collection , because he was one in whose judgment he had confidence . In the meantime , Berenice was beginning to wonder when he would return . She was finding herself , as time went on , more and more lonely without him . Although Lord Stane had taken her to various receptions and evening parties to meet more of his friends , and even to a reception at Court , she missed Cowperwood in some strange , inexplicable way . He was such a dominant force in her life , a power that dwarfed the social atmosphere surrounding Lord Stane . For while she found Stane a warm and attractive companion , on returning to the quiet of Pryor 's Cove she always joined Cowperwoodp219again in thought and mood as well as emotion . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested again in Lorna Maris ? Or someone new ? Or would he return to her as he had left her : obviously in love with her ? And would Aileen return with him , or had he placated her sufficiently to cause her to give him a period of rest ? The jealousy of women ! Her own jealousy , where he was con-cerned ! And after all he had done for her ! Not only for her but for her mother ! It was he who had paid for her schooling , and after that had given her a beautiful New York house on fashionable Park Avenue . Mentally and philosophically , Berenice was more of a cold , realistic turn than otherwise , and just before Cowperwood had been compelledby Aileen 's threats to return to New York , she had about made up her mind that if no too great ill flowed to herself from this last assault of Aileen 's , she might be more gracious to Lord Stane than up to now she had been . For plainly , he was deeply infatuated with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was entertaining the thought of marriage . If I only cared enough , she thought at this time . If only he was less conventional , not so English . She had heard that there was no law in England to prevent him from divorcing a wife who had deceived him by fraud  --  such as she would be guilty of if she married him  --  and this possibility , throughout Cowperwood 's absence , kept her silent and semidistant , thinking of her social state in case Aileen should choose to act . However , her anxiety was gradually relieved by the day to day silence on the part of the London press , and also by a letter from Cowperwood in which he outlined his various difficulties , among them his sudden reduction in health and strength , and at the same time expressed his desire to return to England in order that he might rest and see her again . This reference to his health caused her to ponder on the wisdom of a trip they might take to some region of quiet and beauty which should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But where was such a land ? It was possible that he had already seen and wearied of it , for he had traveled so much  --  Italy , Greece , Switzerland , France , Austria-Hungary , Germany , Turkey , the Holy Land . But what of Norway ? As she now recalled , she had never heard him speak of it . And accordingly , so moved was she by the desire to persuade him to take a rest in a strange and different land that she purchased a book about that country in order to inform herself in detail as to its novelty and beauty . Enthusiastically she turned the pages to study photographs of dark , high cliffs ; mountains or fjells rising perpendicularly to thousands of feet over gorges cut by Nature in a stern , relentless mood ; cataracts and leaping waterfalls , at the base of which lay beautiful , peaceful lakes . And clinging to the sides of tall mountains , like shipwrecked sailors to a life raft , were little farms . She read about their strange gods : Odin , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , Valhalla , a heaven of sorts prepared for the souls of those who had perished in battle . Reading and examining these pictures , the country appeared to be entirely free of industrialism . This land should indeed prove restful for him . By THE time Cowperwood , looking exceedinglytired , arrived in England , Berenice was able to inoculate him with some of her own enthusiasm for Norway , which , strangely enough , he had not previously visited . And so it was , not long after , that he set Jamieson to the task of finding and chartering a yacht . But before one was found , a certain Lord Tilton , hearing through Stane of Cowperwood 's intention , very generously insisted on loaning him his own yacht , the Pelican , for the purpose . And eventually , toward midsummer , he and Berenice were cruising smoothly along the west coast of Norway toward Stavanger Fjord . The yacht was a handsome craft , and Eric Hansen , the Norwegian skipper , a man of skill . He was powerfully built , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complexion and sandycoloredhair that fountained out over his forehead . His eyes were a steely blue that seemed to challenge any sea or any experience connected with it . His movements seemed to suggest a natural bracing against rough weather , even when he walked on level ground  --  a kind of rhythmic oneness with the sea at all times . He had been a seafaring man all of his life , and he truly loved these inland waterwaysthat wound through a maze of mysterious mountains soaringp221straight up thousands of feet from their depths to thousands of feet below the water line . Some said they were the result of faulting or cracking of the crust of the earth 's surface ; others thought volcanic eruptions had caused them . But Eric knew that they had been cut through by mighty prehistoric Vikings who had the power to carve their way through any barrier in order to make highways to the rest of the world . But as Berenice viewed these steep hillsides , with the cottages perched so far above the water 's edge , she could not imagine how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their little homes again . Or for what reason they did it . It all seemed so strange . She was not familiar with the art of mountain-climbing , which the Norwegian had probably learned , out of sheer necessity , from watching his goats maneuver themselves from crag to crag . " What a strange land , " Cowperwood said . " I 'm glad you brought me up here , Bevy , but it does seem to me , beautiful as it is , this countryis one of Nature 's climatic mistakes . There 's too much daylight in summer and too little in winter . Too many romantic waterways and too many sterile mountains . Although I must confess that it interests me enormously . " Indeed , Berenice had noticed his interest in the country was intense . He frequently rang for his very respectful skipper in order that he might ask questions . " What do they live on in these towns , outside of fish ? " he inquired of Eric . " Well , Mr. Dickson "  --  the name assumed by Cowperwood  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have goats and they sell goat 's milk . They have chickens , and so , eggs . They have cows . In fact , they often judge a man 's wealth by the number of cows he owns . Also they have butter . These are sturdy , hard-working people , and they can make five acres yield more than you would believe . AlthoughI 'm not an expert on the subject , and really ca n't tell you much about it , they get along better than you would think . Anotherthing , " he continued , " most of the young men of this region go in for training in navigation . When they get a little older , they get positions as captains , mates , or cooks , on the hundreds of vessels coming in and out of Norway and touching the cities and shipping centers all over the world . "  | At this point Berenice spoke up . " It strikes me that what they lack in quantity , they make up in quality , " was her comment . " You 're right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what I mean , " and , becoming more enthusiastic , he continued : " In fact , they 've learned to live comfortably within themselves . But they know the world , not only from the outside of books but inside . We Norwegiansare a bookish people , prizing education . Illiterates are almost non-existent here , and you may not believe it , but Norway has more telephones than Spain or Poland . It also has its literary and musical celebrities : Grieg , Hamsun , Ibsen , Bjornson "  --  names which caused Cowperwood to pause and think how small a part literature had played in his life , and to suggest to Berenice that she give him some of the books she had been reading . And Berenice , noting his meditative mood , and suspecting that he might be contrasting this wonder world with his own troublesome one , decided to switch the conversation to something a little more cheerful , and turning to Skipper Hansen , she asked : " Captain Hansen , are we likely to see any Lapps when we get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madam , " returned the captain . " We might run into them anywhere north of Trondheim . We 're almost to that point now . " From Trondheim the yacht steamed northward toward Hammerfest , the land of the midnight sun . Several stops were made on the way , one of these being a little extension of rock from one of the great cliffs , called Grotto . It was a very small place of perhaps a dozen houses , used principally as a whaling station . The houses were the usual stone huts , roofed over with grass and earth . It was customary for the whalers at Grotto to buy coal or wood from any boat that was going north or south . And now a small group of fishermen approached the yacht . And though its supply of coal was not more than was actually needed , Cowperwood instructed the skipper to give them several tons , because he felt that these people had so little in their lives . After breakfast Captain Hansen went ashore , and on his return told Cowperwood that a tribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their camp on the mainland , about a half-mile from Grotto . There were about fifteen hundred reindeer , he said , and over a hundred Lapps , with their children and dogs . On hearing this ,  |p223Berenice  expressed a desire to see them . Whereupon Captain Hansen and the mate rowed them over to visit the camp . After disembarking on the shore of the mainland , they walked over toward the reindeer , which were scattered about the tents which spread in all directions . The captain , who knew a few words of their language , talked with the Lapps , and some of them came toward the visitors , making them welcome by shaking hands and inviting them to their tents . In one tent , there was a large pot hanging over a fire , which the mate proceeded to investigate and pronounced to be " dog stew , " but which turned out to be a nice , fat , juicy bear , of which all had a serving . Another tent was packed with fisherfolk and farmers from the surrounding country , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair , at which the Lapps disposed of their reindeer products and bought supplies for the winter . At this point a Lapp woman elbowed her way through the crowd . She greeted Captain Larsen as an old acquaintance , and he informed Cowperwood that she was one of the wealthiest members of the tribe . There followed group singing and dancing , in which all attempted to join . And after liquor and food , and much laughter all around , Cowperwood and his party said good-by and returned to the Pelican . By the light of the never-setting sun , the yacht was turned about , heading its way back to the south . By this time a dozen large bowheadwhales came along within sight of the yacht , and the skipper ordered all sails set in such a fashion as to cause the boat to maneuver among them with the utmost grace . There was intense excitement among passengers and crew as they stood watching the whales . But Cowperwood was more interested in the skill of the captain than he was in the spectacle before his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Berenice . " Every profession , every trade , every form of labor , requires alertness and skill . The skipper , as you see , has complete control of his yacht , and that , in itself , is an achievement . " She smiled at his remark , but made no comment , while he gave himself up to thinking and philosophizing about this arresting world of which , for the time being , he was a part . The thing that impressed him most about this entire northern scene was the fact that it representedsuch a sharp and socially insignificant phase of a world that really had no need for any such temperament as his . The immense oceans , in a large sense , supported its inhabitants by the process of supplying them with fish , and there was enough of employment to enable them to build and make habitable sufficient spaces of soil when they returned , and thus round out their lives in comparative comfort . And yet he felt that these people had more from life in sheer beauty , simple comfort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like him who were so strenuously engaged in accumulating money . As for himself , he was getting old , and the best part of his life was already gone . What , really , lay ahead for him ? More subways ? More art galleries ? More irritations due to public opinion ? True enough , this trip had been restful . But now hourly he was moving into many things that were far from peaceful , and if continuedby him could only result in more arguments , more lawyers , more newspaper criticism , more domestic ills . He smiled to himself ironically . He must not think too much . Take things as they come and make the best of them . After all , the world had done more for him than for most , and the least he could do was to be grateful , and he was . Several days later as they neared Oslo on the return trip , he suggested that in order to avoid danger of publicity , Berenice would better leave the yacht there and return by steamer to Liverpool , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cove . He was happy to see how practically she accepted this decision , and yet he could sense from her expression how much she resented the forces which invariably controlled and interrupted their relationship . Cowperwood 's vacation in Norway havingput him in such excellent physical condition , he was anxious to proceed with his business affairs , in a concentrated effort to reach the goal he had set for himself of $185,000,000 capital and one hundred and forty miles of track and electrification of the entire underground mileage by January of 1905 . He was so driven by his renewed ambition and desire to complete this work and prove its import that he could scarcely permit himself to rest , at Pryor 's Cove or anywhere else . And so , for the next few months , there were directors ' meetings ,  |p225discussions  with interested and important investors , engineering problems , and private sessions , sometimes in the evenings , with Lord Stane and Elverson Johnson . Finally , there arose the necessity of making a trip to Vienna , in order to examine an electric motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reduce the cost of underground operation by a very considerable sum . After seeing the motor and observing its operation , he was convinced of its value , and at once wired several of his engineers to come to Vienna to confirm his opinion . On his way back to London , he stopped off at the Ritz Hotel , in Paris . On his first evening there he met an old colleague in the lobby of the hotel , one Michael Shanley , a one-time employee of his in Chicago , who suggested that they go to hear a concert at the Paris Opera House . There was much talk of the compositions of a Pole by the name of Chopin that were to be played there . The name was only vaguely familiar to Cowperwood , and even less so to Shanley , but they went ; and Cowperwood was so entranced by the music that on reading in the program notes that Chopin was buried at Pere-Lachaise , he suggested they visit that world-famous burial ground next day . Accordingly , the following morning he and Shanley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who , in English , furnished . them with much information as they walked along the cypress-borderedavenues of the cemetery . Thus they learned that here , under this shaft , lay Sarah Bernhardt , who , in past days in Chicago , had so moved him with her golden voice . A little farther on was the tomb of Balzac , of whose works he knew only that they were considered great . As he paused and gazed , he once again became sensible of the fact that his own particular labors had barred him from knowledge of the intellectual and artistic significance of genius in many other fields . They passed the tombs of Bizet , De Musset , Moliere , and at last they came to Chopin 's resting place , which they found to be strewn with ribbon-tied bouquets of roses and lilies . " Think of that now ! " exclaimed Shanley . " To be sure , he 's a great musician , but he 's been dead for more than half a century , and here are all these flowers ! Be gor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know ! " Which thought caused Cowperwood to question the likelihood of flowers being strewn over his own grave , even a year after his death  --  an idea which amused more than it irritated him , for he well knew there were few graves anywhere , earnest labors or no earnest labors , strewn with flowers after so many years . However , before leaving Pere-Lachaise , he was destined for one more surprise . For as they turned south toward an exit , they suddenlycame upon the lovely double tomb of Abelard and Heloise , concerning which their guide proceeded to recite the well-known tragic romance of the ill-starred pair . Heloise and Abelard ! The love of a young girl for the spiritually brilliant monk , and the savage brutalityof her father , the cruel member of a bishop 's council of a cathedralof the eleventh century ! Cowperwood , up to this hour , had never heard of these lovers . But now , as he stood listening to the guide , an obviously refined and very attractive woman , carrying a basket filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multicolored blossoms upon and around it . Both Cowperwood and Shanley were so moved by this that they removed their hats , and , catching her eye , respectfully bowed . She acknowledged their interestby saying : " Merci beaucoup , messieurs , " and walked away . But this colorful and moving incident set up a train of thought in Cowperwood 's mind which related to himself and the Aileen of his earlier days . For , after all , when he , at one point in his career , had been imprisoned in Philadelphia , it was she who , in face of all of his enemies , including her father , had visited him faithfully to declare her unchanging love and ease his lot in any way she could . Like Heloise with Abelard , she had wanted him and no one else , and still did so , as he knew . Suddenly there flashed into his mind the idea of a. , tomb for the two of them ; ' a beautiful and enduring resting place . Yes , he would employ an architect , secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commemorate the fact that at least at one time he had cared for her as much as she cared for him . ON COWPERWOOD 's return to London , Berenice was startled by the change in his appearance . He seemed utterly weary , and had obviously lost weight . She complained to him about his lack of consideration of his own physical welfare and the fact that she saw so little of him.  | " Frank , dear , " she began , in an affectionate tone , " why do you let these things take so much of your time and energy ? You seem so strained and nervous . Do n't you think you should see a doctor and have a thorough examination before you go any further ? " " Bevy , dear , " he said , putting his arm around her waist , " there 's no need for you to be so concerned . I know I 'm working too hard , but this will soon be over and I wo n't have to bother with so many business angles any more , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really feel all right ? " " Yes , dear , I think I 'm all right . Anyhow , this particular phase of development is so important that I feel I must give it my personal attention . " But even as he said this , he stooped forward as if stricken by a sudden pain . She ran to his side , exclaiming : " Frank , what is it ? What 's the matter ? Have you ever had anything like this before ? " " No , dear , I certainly have n't , " he said . " But it ca n't be anything serious , I 'm sure . " And he partially recovered himself . " Of course , " he continued , " there must be something to cause such a sharp pain . Maybe you 'd better call Dr. Wayne and ask him to come over and take a look at me . . . " a suggestion that sent Berenice at once to the telephone . When the doctor arrived , he was surprised to find Cowperwood looking so drawn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be filled at once , he asked him to come to his office next morning for a thorough check-up , which Cowperwood agreed to do . However , within a week , after two of the best specialists in London had been called in by Dr. Wayne and reported to him their conclusions , he was shocked to learn that a severe kidney condition had developed that might end fatally within a comparatively short time . He ordered Cowperwood to rest and take the prescribed drugs that were meant to induce less activity . However , when Cowperwood came into Dr. Wayne 's office a few days later for his physical report , he told the doctor that he was feelingbetter and his appetite appeared to be normal . " The trouble with these cases , Mr. Cowperwood , " said Dr. Wayne , very quietly , at this point , " is that they are eccentric in their effects , and the pain they produce sometimes stops for a time . However , that does n't mean that the patient is cured , or even better . The pains may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the part of our specialists , who are not always correct by any means . Rather , the patient may grow better and live for years . On the other hand , he may grow worse , and that is one of the conditions which makes this disease so difficult to deal with . So you see , Mr. Cowperwood , that is why I can not speak to you as definitely as I would like to . " Here Cowperwood interrupted him . " I feel there 's something you 'd like to tell me , Dr. Wayne . And I would most certainly like to know exactly what the report of the specialists is . It does n't matter what it is , I want to know . Are my kidneys so bad ? Is there any organic trouble which is fatal ? " Dr. Wayne looked at him with a steady gaze . " Well , the specialists report that with rest and no hard work , you may live a year or a little more . With extreme care , you may even live longer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's disease , Mr. Cowperwood . However , as I have explained to you , they are not always right . " This studied reply was received by Cowperwood calmly and thoughtfully , even though now , for the first time in his almost uniformlyhealthy life , he was faced with news of a probably fatal disease . Death ! Probably no more than a year to live ! An end to all of his creative labors ! And yet , if it was to be , it was to be , and he must brace himself and take it . After leaving the doctor 's office , he felt himself not so much concerned with his own condition as with the effect of his final passing on the several personalities so closely connected with him throughout his life : Aileen , Berenice , Sippens ; his son , Frank Cowperwood , Jr. ; his first wife , Anna ( now Mrs. Wheeler ) ; and their daughter Anna , whom he had not seen for years , still for whom he had made ample provision over a long period . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way to Pryor 's Cove later on in the day , he kept turning over in his mind the necessity of putting all of his affairs in order . The first thing to do now was to make his will , even though these specialists might be wrong . He must provide financially for all those who were closest to him . And then there was his treasured art gallery , which he intended to leave to the public . There was also the hospital which he had always desired so keenly to establish in New York . He must do something about that . After paying the variousp229heirs and such beneficiaries as he proposed to favor , there should still be ample means for a hospital that offered the best services to all who chanced to be without funds and had no place else to turn . Besides , there was the matter of the tomb which he wished to erect for himself and Aileen . He must consult an architect and have him carry out a design that would be beautiful and appropriate . It might compensate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what about Berenice ? As he now saw it , he could not provide for her openly in his will . He did not wish to expose her to the prying inquiries of the press and the inescapable envy of the public in general . But he would arrange the matter now in a different way . Though he had already established an independent trust fund for her , he would now cash an additional block of bonds and shares which he held in various corporations , and transfer the cash to her . This would insure her against danger of lack of funds in the years to come . But by now his carriage had arrived at Pryor 's Cove , and his troublesometrain of thought was interrupted by the appearance of Berenice , smiling affectionately and anxious to hear what the doctor had said . But , as usual , in his independent , stoical way , he waved her inquiry aside as not too important . " It is n't anything of consequence , dear , " he said . " A little irritation of the bladder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and advised me to ease up on work . " " There ! I knew it ! That 's what I 've been saying all along ! You should rest more , Frank , and not be doing so much actual physical labor . " But here Cowperwood successfully changed the subject . " Speaking of hard work , " he said , " is anyone around here doing anything about those squabs and that special bottle of wine you were telling me about this morning . . . ? " " Oh , you incorrigible ! Here comes Phenie now to set the table . We 're having dinner on the terrace . " He seized her hand , saying : " You see , God protects the honest and the industrious ... " And cheerfully , hand in hand , they walked into the house together.  | ALTHOUGH Cowperwood appeared tohave enjoyed his dinner with Berenicevery much , his mind had been , treadmill fashion , going round andround in a circle which included in one section his various commercialand financial interests and in another the various individuals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the completion of the great traction systems in which he had been so absorbed . Themen , in the main so helpful , the women so entertaining ; all of whom , collectively , had made him some thirty colorful years . And now , although he did not really believe the doctors ' diagnosis to be as fateful as it had sounded , nevertheless , because of their prediction as to the finality of his days , plus this lovely hour with Berenice , here by the Thames , and this pleasant lawn that spread before them , he could not help but feel the fleeting beauty of life and its haunting poignancy . For his life had been so full , so dramatic , and so memorable . Only now to be made to contemplate the possibility of the sudden cessation of all that he could look upon as himself , had a tendency to emphasize the value of all he had been and enjoyed . Berenice  --  so young , so wise , and so entertaining  --  who , under favorableconditions , could be with him for so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so cheerfully and helpfully thinking about , as he could feel . For once he could not contemplate the fatal processes of life with his usual equanimity . Actually he could only consider the poetic value of this hour , and its fleetingness , which involved sorrow and nothing but sorrow . However his outward manner indicated nothing of his mental depression , for he had already concluded that he must pretend , act . He must go about his affairs as usual until the very hour or moment when this medical prediction should be fulfilled , if it were to be fulfilled . So he left Pryor 's Cove in the morning for his office , as usual , where he went through his daily routine with the same calm and precision as he had always displayed in connection with decisions , procedure , etc . Only now he felt called upon to set in motion such varying processes as would lead to the fulfillment of all of his personal wishes in the event of his death . One of these was the tomb for himself and the disappointedp231Aileen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked him to report to him the names and unquestionable skill of any architect , either in England or on the Continent , who had achieved a reputation for the building of mausoleums . He wished the data as soon as possible , as he was getting it for a friend . This done , he turned his attention to his favorite interest : his art gallery , to which he wanted to add such paintings as would make his an outstanding collection . To this end he addressed a number of letters to persons who bought and sold such masterpieces , and eventually secured some very valuable paintings : among them a Bouguereau , " Invading Cupid 's Realm " ; Corot 's " The Path to the Village " ; a Frans Hals , " Portrait of a Woman " ; Rembrandt 's " Resurrection of St. Lazarus . " These he shipped to New York . Alongside of these specific activities , however , were the inevitable details in connection with the underground project . Claims , quarrels , interference from rivals , petty lawsuits ! However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the requirements of the situation , and also , by this time , he was beginning to feel so much better that he concluded there was nothing of import to the original pains which had caused him to consult a physician . In fact , his future looked more rosy than at any time since first he had come to London . Even Berenice decided that his old physical stamina had reasserted itself . In the meantime , Lord Stane , impressed by Cowperwood 's creative energy , which was expressing itself in so many new and original ideas , decided that now would be the time to stage a social affair in Cowperwood 's honor at his lovely sea place , Tregasal , where at least two hundred guests could be accommodated . And so , after much meditation as to the important persons to be invited , the date was set , and Tregasal , with its beautiful grounds and its huge ballroom , with chandeliers rivaling the glitter of the moonlight , the scene of the ball . Lord Stane , standing near the main entrance , greeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entering on Cowperwood 's arm , he thought she was especially beautiful tonight , in a trailing white gown of Greek design and simplicity , held at the waist with a golden cord , her red hair crowning this costume as might a wreath of gold . And to climax all for Stane , as she approached she looked and smiled at him in such a way that all he could say was : " Berenice ! Beautiful ! You are a dream of loveliness ! "  --  a greeting which Cowperwood , stopping to exchange a few words with one of his most important stockholders , failed to catch . " I must have the second dance , " said Stane , holding her hand for a moment . And she graciously nodded her head . After greeting Berenice , he welcomed Cowperwood , his honored guest , in a most cordial manner , detaining him long enough for the numerous officials of the Underground and their wives to greet him . It was not long before supper was announced , and the guests , enteringand seating themselves , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus a special brand of champagne which Stane was satisfied would please the most exacting taste . Laughter and the murmur of conversation increased in volume , pleasingly modified by the soft notes of the music floating in from the adjoining chamber . Berenice found herself seated near the head of the table , with Lord Stane on one side and the Earl of Bracken on the other , the latter a rather attractive young man , who , long before the end of the third course , was urging her to be charitable enough to save for him at the least the third or fourth dance . But while she was both interested and flattered , her eyes were constantly following the motions of Cowperwood , who , at the other end of the table , was indulging in lively conversation with an exceedingly attractive brunette on one side while obviously not neglecting a very engaging beauty on the other . She was pleased to find him relaxed and entertained , since for some time she had not seen him so . However , the dining being of considerable duration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear as to Cowperwood . His gestures and conversation , she noted , were becoming more and more enthusiastic , obviously because of the champagne , and this troubled her . And when , finally , Lord Stane made the announcement that all who wished to dance could now adjourn to the ballroom , and Cowperwood came over to claim her for a dance , she was still further troubled by his elated manner . And yet he walked with the air of one who was as sober as anyone present . As they moved together in the rhythmic measures of the waltz , she whispered to him : " Are you happy , darling ? " " Never happier , " he answered . " I 'm with you , my beautiful ! " " Darling ! " whispered Berenice.  | " Is n't it wonderful , Bevy ? You , this place , these people ! This -- is. -. - what I 've been seeking all.my life ! " She smiled affectionately at him , but just then she felt him sway slightly and then pause and place his hand to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must get outside ! " She took firm hold of his hand and led him toward an open door out onto a balcony facing the sea . She urged and aided him to the nearest bench , on which he sank limply and heavily . By now she was terribly alarmed , and ran toward a servant who was passing with a tray , exclaiming : " Please ! I need help ! Get someone , and help me get him to a bedroom . He is seriously ill . " The frightened servant immediately called the butler , who had Cowperwood carried into an unoccupied chamber on the same floor , after which Lord Stane was notified . He , upon his arrival , was so shocked by Berenice 's distress that he ordered the butler to remove Cowperwood to his own suite on the second floor , and at once called his own physician , Dr. Middleton . Also the butler was instructed to insure silence on the part of all of the servants in regard to this . In the meantime , Cowperwood was beginning to stir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to be conscious of the need of caution and to say to Stane that the less said about this the better , other than that he had tripped and fallen . He was sure , he said , he would be all right in the morning . Dr. Middleton , however , had a different idea about his illness , and gave him a sedative . After which he advised that the sick man remain where he was for a day or two , at least , in order that he might discover whether there were any complications . For , as he said to Stane , Cowperwood 's condition was probably more serious than a fainting spell . THE next morning , when Cowperwoodawakened in the Stane suite , he found himself , except for the goings and comings of very courteous servants , alone for a time , and it was then that he began to run over in his mind the fairly disturbing phases of all that had so swiftly happened to him . For he was a little startled by the fact that , after having arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical welfare , he should be so suddenly made aware of his illness . Was it really true that he had fallen victim to this fatal Bright 's disease ? At the time of Dr. Middleton 's call he had not been sufficientlyalert to discuss this matter of his collapse . For one thing , as he now recalled , he had had the sensation of extreme shortness of breath , which finally resulted in the physical weakness which caused him to fall . Was that due to a kidney condition , as earlier described by Dr. Wayne , or was it a matter of too much champagne , too much food ? The doctor , as he recalled , had impressed upon him that he was not to drink anything but water and eat very lightly . To make sure that he was following the right course in regard to himself , he decided to have Berenice cable his old-time friend and personal physician , Dr. Jefferson James , in New York , to come to London at once . This trusted friend would be the one to satisfy him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly and somewhat calmly surveyed the situation , there was a tap at the door , and Lord Stane entered , making of his coming a very cheerful and gracious affair . " There you are ! " he exclaimed . " You and your beautiful girls and your champagne ! Think of it ! Are n't you really ashamed of yourself ? " Cowperwood smiled broadly . " And , incidentally , " went on Stane , " I have an order to inflict severe punishment on you for at least twenty-four hours . No champagne ! Instead , water ! No caviar , not a grain , only a thin sliver of beef , plus more water ! Perhaps , when you 're about ready to collapse , a bowl of thin gruel and more water ! " Cowperwood sat up . " I call that tops for cruelty , " he said . " But perhaps you can be induced to share my water and gruel . In the meantime , and strictly in confidence , you might tell me what Dr. Middleton told you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said was that you were forgettingthat your years are creeping up on you , and that champagne and caviar are entirely outside your present powers of digestion . Also dancing until sunrise . Hence your collapse on my overly polished ballroom floor . And hence Dr. Middleton 's approaching visit to find out how you 're getting along , although he says he can not find that there is anything seriously wrong with you other than overwork , which is something you can easily remedy . And I must tell you that your lovely ward , who was good enough to accept my offer of lodg/ing for the night , will be down shortly . I need not tell you , of course , that she is as greatly concerned as I am , regardless of Dr. Middleton 's conclusions "  --  a statement which caused Cowperwood to assert rather positively : " But there 's nothing of any consequence the matter with me . I may not be as good as new , but I 'm still somewhere near it . And as far as business is concerned , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a matter of fact , you should be able to judge for yourself , by the results so far , whether our affairs are being managed capably or not . " There was just a tinge of reproach in his tone , which Stane noticed . " The results have been tremendous , " he said . " Anyone who could come over here with such a proposition as yours and secure $25,000 ; 00o from American investors , certainly deserves nothing but complimentsfrom me . And I 'm glad to express my gratitude , and that of our investors , for your interest and your services . The only trouble is , Cowperwood , it all rests on your broad American shoulders and your continued health and strength . And that is important . " At this point there was a knock on the door , following which Bereniceentered . After greetings and light conversation , Stane urged both to stay as long as they wished , whether it be a week or a month . But Cowperwood , feeling the need of extreme privacy as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After Stane had left , he turned to Berenice , and said : " It is n't that I feel so badly , dearest . I do n't , but because of the need of avoiding publicity of any kind , I would like us to leave here as soon as possible , and if I had my choice , I would rather go to Pryor 's Cove than to the hotel . Wo n't you please arrange it with Lord Stane so that we may leave here in the morning ? " " Of course , dear , " replied Berenice , " if that 's what you want . I would feel better myself if you were over there near me . " " There 's one other thing , Bevy , " went on Cowperwood . " I want you to get Jamieson to cable to Dr. Jefferson James in New York . He 's my old physician and friend . Ask him , if possible , to come to London . Tell Jamieson this is to be confidential and in code . He can reach him at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do feel that there is something wrong with you ? " Her tone indicated her nervousness.  | " No ! Not as bad as all that by any means , but , as you see for yourself , I 'm in a rather uncertain state as to what 's really wrong with me . Besides , as far as my public affairs are concerned , it might strike any person , particularly my stockholders and investors , as very peculiarthat a man should suddenly collapse for no apparent reason , although I may have overdone my eating and drinking a little bit last night , particularly as to the champagne . But certainly I never felt like that before . And I surely would like to see Jefferson . He 'll know , and will tell me the truth . " " Frank , " interrupted Berenice at this point , " what did Dr. Wayne tell you the last time you saw him that you did not tell me ? What did the specialists ' report show ? " " Oh , Dr. Wayne said that the pain I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease , only he was not sure , because , he said , there are two phases of Bright 's disease , chronic and acute . Mine , he said , was neither one nor the other . He said I would have to wait and see if anything of a more serious nature developed beforeany specialist could give a correct diagnosis . " " Well , if that 's the case , I think Dr. James should come over . I 'll get Jamieson to cable him tomorrow . In the meantime , I certainly think that Pryor 's Cove is the place for you until such time as Dr. James feels you are all right . " Whereupon she crossed to the window , drawing the shade , and asked him to try and rest for a period while she went to make all the arrangements necessary for their departure in the morning . But even as she did this , her mind was wrestling with the import of all this to him , and though she was outwardly gracious , she was trembling inwardly . " You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she informed him of their decision to go to Pryor 's Cove . " It is likely to have a soothing effect on him , I 'm sure , as it has had on me many times in the past . Besides , your mother is there , and she will be of help to you . If you will permit me , I 'll drive you over myself in the morning . Mr. Cowperwood is far too important to me to overlook anything that might contribute to his comfort and speedy recovery . "  | THE aftermath of all this was , in thecourse of the next two weeks , the arrival at Pryor 's Cove of Dr. James , who , seeing Cowperwood resting comfortably in a bedroom overlooking the Thames , paused to observe : " Well , Frank , I see that you 're not so ill that you ca n't enjoy the beautiful view through these windows . I 'm half-inclined to suggest that you get up and hurry over to New York and let me stretch out here until I recover from my labors of getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . " " Did n't you enjoy your trip over ? " asked Cowperwood . " I never welcomed a change more in my life . It was beautiful . The sea was calm and there was a minstrel troupe aboard that entertained me enormously . They were headed , if you please , for Vienna , and half of them were Negroes . " " Same old Jeff ! " commented Cowperwood . " My , what a pleasure it is to see you again ! If I have wished once , I have wished a score of times that you were over here and could study some of the oddities of these English ! " " Bad as all that , are they ? " said James , amusedly . " But suppose you tell me the story of all this from the beginning . Where were you , and why were you arrested ? " Whereupon Cowperwood slowly and carefully proceeded to recite the incidents of his life and labors since he had returned from Norway , together with the opinions of Dr. Wayne and the specialists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come over , Jeff , " he concluded . " I knew you would tell me the truth . The specialists said it might be Bright 's disease . In fact , they said I might not live more than a year and a half at the most , although Dr. Wayne did say that the conclusionsof specialists are not necessarily always correct . " " Right ! " said Dr. James , emphatically . " Dr. Wayne 's opinion , of course , " continued Cowperwood , " may have given me a false sense of security , for it was n't so very long after that I did quite some celebrating , at Lord Stane 's place , and that brought on the disturbing incident I have described to you . I found myself suddenly very short of breath and had to be helped from the room . It 's made me rather doubtful of Dr. Wayne 's diagnosis . But now that you 're here , I expect to be told the truth and put on the right track . " At this point Dr. James stepped forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now show me how deep you can breathe , " he said , and after Cowperwood 's best effort in that direction , the doctor said : " Ah , I see , a little dilation of the stomach . I shall have to leave you something for that . " " Does it look as though I have a fatal disease , Jeff ? " " Not so fast , Frank . After all , I have to make some examinations . But I can say this : you have already seen two doctors and three specialists , and you 've learned that it might cause your death or it might not cause your death . As you know , there 's always a wide margin between the possible and the impossible , between the certain and the uncertain , and there 's always a wide margin between sicknessand health . But looking at you here now , and taking into considerationyour general physical tone , I think you are likely to be around here for some months yet , maybe for several years . You must give me time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you . In the meantime , tomorrow morning , fairly early , I 'll be back here to make a complete physical examination . " " Wait a minute ! " exclaimed Cowperwood . " My orders are that you 're to stay here with us , with me and my ward , Miss Fleming , and her mother . " " It 's very good of you , Frank , to ask me , but I ca n't stay today . It just so happens that there are one or two drugs I 'll have to find in London before I go on with you . But I 'll come back about eleven in the morning , and after that , I 'll stay with you , if you wish , at least long enough to make you a better , if not a wiser , man . But now , no champagne , in fact no liquor of any kind , for a while at least , and no food with the exception of a cream soup , perhaps , and plenty of buttermilk . " Whereupon Berenice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James , after greeting her turned to Cowperwood and exclaimed : " How can you be ill , with such a cure for all ills right here at your bedside ! You may be sure I 'll be here bright and early in the morning . " After which , and very professionally , he explained to Berenicep239that when he returned he would require hot water , towels , and some charcoal from a brightly blazing fireplace which he saw in an adjoiningroom . " To think I should have come all the way from New York to treat him , with the cure right here , " he observed to her , smilingly . " This world is too ridiculous for any use . " Berenice , noting how wise and gay he was , liked him at once , and thought of the many strong and interesting people Frank invariably drew to himself . Accordingly , after an added personal talk with Cowperwood , he left for the city , but not before he had caused Cowperwood to feel that his gigantic financial obligations constituted a form of disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , Frank , " he told him , seriously . " The brain is a thinking , creative , and directive organ which can cause you as much trouble as any fatal disease , of which worry is one , and I think you have that disease now . My problem is to make you know that that is true , and that your life is worth more to you than any ten underground systems . If you insist on putting work first , any quack doctor can truthfully assure you that at your age you are likely to die . So now my problem is to get your mind off your underground systems , and get you to take a real rest . " " I will do the best I can , " said Cowperwood , " but some of these burdens are not so easy to drop as you may imagine . They concern the interests of hundreds of people who have put their complete faith in me , besides millions of Londoners who have never been able to travel beyond the limits of their own neighborhoods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride to all parts of London for as little as tuppence , and so get a fairly good idea of what their city is like . " " There you go , Frank ! If your life should suddenly end , where would your Londoners be then ? " " My Londoners will be all right , whether I live or die , assuming that I get my underground plan fully launched before I die . Yes , , Jeff , I 'm afraid I do put my work far above myself . In fact , this thing I 've started has already grown so large that no one man is indispensable to it now , not even me , although there are many things ! I can do if I live long enough to carry out my ideas . "  | DR . JAMES , meanwhile , had much toponder over concerning Cowperwood 's illness and the financial burdens which troubled him . As for the Bright 's disease which the London physician had suggested might be so swiftly fatal , he knew of related cases that had endured for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case that were serious . For one , the dilation of the stomach , and for another , the acute pains that attacked him from time to time ; certainly these , along with his mental disturbance in regard to his business affairs , might do him great harm . Another disturbing factor was his worry over various problems in connection with his past life , about which James knew a great deal  --  his first wife , his son ; Aileen , and other attachments which had from time to time been commented on in the newspapers . What to do , what to do for this man for whom he cared so much What particular thing , apart from medicine , might tend to restore him , if for no more than a period of time ! The mind ! The mind ! If he could only mentally , as well as medically , influence his mind to come to its own rescue ! Suddenly he felt that he had stumbled upon the required idea . This was that Cowperwood must be strengthened to the point where he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only to interest him in a change ' of scene but to cause the public , both in England and America , to be astonished by the news that he was well enough to be traveling , so that I people would say : Why , this man is n't sick ! He 's so much recovered that he can travel and enjoy himself ! " The effect of this would probably not only restore Cowperwood 's somewhat depleted nervous energy but cause him to believe that he was well , or at least very much better . Strangely enough , the place that the good doctor 's mind returned to again and again as a possible solution of his problem was the Riviera , Monte Carlo , the great gambling center . How effective it would be if the press were to announce his presence there , at the gambling tables , among grandiose dukes and Asiatic princes ! Psychologically , would that not enhance Cowperwood 's standing as a financier ? A thousand to one it would !  |p241The  next day , when he returned to Pryor 's Cove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion . " Personally , Frank , " he began , " I think that in about three weeks you should be well enough to leave here and take a nice leisurely trip . So my prescription now is that temporarily you abandon this life here and go abroad with me . " " Abroad ? " queried Cowperwood , his tone expressing his astonishment . " Yes , and do you want to know why ? Because the newspapers would certainly take note of the fact that you were able to travel . That 's what you want , is n't it ? " " Quite ! " replied Cowperwood . " Where do we go ? " " Well , Paris , maybe , and probably we might go to Carlsbad  --  . a most detestable watering place , I know , but excellent for you physically . " " For God 's sake , where do I go from there ? " " Well , " said James , " you may have your choice of Prague , Budapest , Vienna , and the Riviera , including Monte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Me in Monte Carlo ! " " Yes , you in Monte Carlo , as sick as you imagine yourself to be . Appearing in Monte Carlo at this particular time is certain to producejust the reaction you want in connection with yourself . Yet , actually , you need not do anything more than appear in one of the gambling rooms and lose a few thousand dollars , so that the news can be spread abroad . People will comment on your being there , and the fact that it seems to make no difference to you as to the amount of money you toss away . " " Stop , stop ! " shouted Cowperwood . " If I have the strength , I 'll go , and if it does n't turn out right . I 'll sue you for breach of prom-ise ! " " Do that , " returned James . Consequently , after three weeks of constant observation and medicationon the part of Dr. James , who had taken up his residence at Pryor 's Cove , Cowperwood himself felt that he was much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , decided that his patient had sufficiently revived physically to undertake the travel program suggested . However , Berenice , delighted as she was to know that Cowperwoodwas improving in health , was nevertheless troubled by the idea of the trip . She was well aware that rumors concerning a fatal illness would probably disrupt-his whole economic plan , but loving him as she did , she could not help conjuring up fears that such a trip might not prove as valuable and effective as Dr. James and Cowperwood thought . But Cowperwood assured her that she had nothing to worry about , since he felt better , and the plan was ideal . The following week end they departed . And true enough , the London press immediately announced that Frank Cowperwood , recently rumored to be seriously ill , was apparently so completely recovered as to be able to indulge in a pleasure tour of Europe . A little later there were still other newspaper items , from Paris , from Budapest , from Carlsbad , Vienna , and from Monte Carlo , fabulous Monte Carlo . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indestructable Cowperwood , so recently ill , had chosen Monte Carlo as a place of pleasure and rest . " However , on his return to London , the questions put to him by reporters took on a very frank and open character . One reporter asked : " Is there any truth to the rumor , Mr. Cowperwood , that you 've been seriously ill ? " " As a matter of fact , my boy , " replied Cowperwood , " I had been working too hard and found I needed a rest . A doctor friend of mine did accompany me on this trip , and we 've just been puttering around the Continent . " He laughed heartily when the World correspondent asked whether or not it was true that he had bequeathed his priceless art treasures to the Metropolitan Museum of Art . " If people want to know what is in my will , " he said , " they 'll have to wait until I 'm under the turf , and I can only hope that their charity is as strong as their curiosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berenice and Dr. James as they read them on the spacious lawn of Pryor 's Cove . Dr. James , though steadily conscious of the necessity of returning to New York and his practice there , found himself drawn further and further into the affections of Cowperwood , and Berenice as well . For both were grateful to him beyond measure for having brought Cowperwood back to seemingly normal health and strength . And so , when the time came for the doctor to leave , there was an emotional sense of gratitude and mental union among all three . " There 's really nothing I can say to you , Jeff , " said Cowperwood ,  |p243as  he and Berenice walked with the doctor to the gangplank of the steamer on which he was about to leave . " Anything I can do for you is yours to command . I ask but one thing : that our friendship continue as it has in the past . " " Do n't try to reward me , Frank , " interrupted James . " Knowing ' you all these years has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 York when you can . I 'll be waiting to see you again . " Picking up his bag , he added : " Well , friends , boats wait for no man ! " and with that he smiled and again shook hands , finally merging with the throng now boarding the boat . Now that Dr. James was gone , Cowperwoodwas faced with the many labors which had accumulated during his absence . These would require months of concentrated energy and attention , the while he found it necessary to turn to certain phases of his personal problems , one of which was a letter from Aileen , in which she stated that while the alterations being made in the new addition were going forward under the supervision of Pyne , the architect , she felt that Cowperwoodshould return to New York as soon as possible in order to look the whole plan over , so that he could either approve or disapprovebefore it was too late . She was not sure there would be space enough in the new gallery for the pictures he had recently added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion as an art expert , there were times when she felt that Cowperwood would disagree wholeheartedly with him if he were present . Cowperwood realized that this was something that deserved his attention . Still , at this particular time he felt he could ill afford a trip to New York . There were too many urgent matters of policy and practical details concerning the underground that demanded his personal supervision . Of course , Lord Stane , who was frequently about , assured him of the now probably smooth future of the entire system , and by his interest and efforts succeeded in lessening the former friction among the varied interests . Stane seemed to be very much relieved and pleased at his recovery . " Well , Cowperwood , " he said to him the first morning after his return , " you look as good as new . How did you do it ? "  | " I did n't do it , " replied Cowperwood . " It was all the work of my old friend , Jeff James . He 's pulled me out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pulled me out of a financial jam as well . " " You 're right there , " said Stane . " You certainly fooled the public in a masterly fashion . " " That was Jeff 's brilliant idea . He not only took me on the trip to allay suspicion and rumor , but he cured me en route , " said Cowperwood . Another matter that compelled his personal attention at this time was the discussion with Rexford Lynnwood , one of three Americansculptors whose names had been suggested by Jamieson regardingthe tomb he proposed to have built . Lynnwood 's qualificationsappealed to Cowperwood because of the fact that in connection with a prize recently offered for a tomb and statue to mark the grave of a lately deceased governor of one of the southern states , his design carried on one of its surfaces a reproduction of the cabin in which the man had been born , and at the foot of a huge , moss-covered oak tree was drawn the outline of a horse which he had ridden in various battles of the Civil War . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pathos and simplicity of the whole conception . Later as he sat opposite Lynnwood on the other side of his massive working desk , he was struck by the man 's classic features , his deep-set eyes , and tall angular figure . In fact , he immediately liked the fellow . As Cowperwood explained to Lynnwood , his idea for the tomb leaned toward the Greco-Roman style of architecture , but not in its purest conception . Rather , he would like it to be a modification , with some originality of design in its details . It was to be large , because he had always liked the idea of space , and was to be made of pebble-gray granite of rich texture . He would like a narrow slit of a window at one end , and a place for two sarcophagi , with two heavy bronze doors opening into the tomb itself . Lynnwood approvedand was even delighted with the opportunity of executing this structure . He drew several sketches as Cowperwood talked , and these pleased Cowperwood greatly . A contract was agreed upon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lynnwood began gathering his designs and placing them in his portfolio , he paused and looked at Cowperwood.  | " Well , Mr. Cowperwood , " he said as he was leaving , " judging from the way you look , I 'm sure it will be a long time before you will be needing this . At least , I sincerely hope so . " " Well , thank you very much , " said Cowperwood . " But do n't count on that . " DURING this time Cowperwood livedprincipally in the agreeable thought of returning , at the end of the day , to Pryor 's Cove and Berenice . For the first time in years he was enjoying the simplicities of a genuine home , a place which , because of the spirit with which Berenice infused it , caused anything and everything from a game of checkers to a short walk along the Thames to seem rich in color and feeling and make him wish that it would go on forever . Even growing old would no - such an ordeal if it could be passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months after his return to business , as he sat in his office preparing a note for Aileen , he was suddenly seized with the sharpest pain of any thus far experienced in connection with his illness . It was not unlike a sharp knife being pushed and turned in the region of his left kidney , and from there it seemed to leap to his heart . When he attempted to get up from his chair , he was unable to do so . In fact , as at Tregasal , his breath seemed to fail him , and he could not move . But in a few moments the pain lessened and he was able to reach over to a push button to summon Jamieson . As he was about to press the button , however , he drew back his hand and decided that perhaps this was simply one of those acute pains he had been warned to expect , and which he had been assured would not be fatal . And so he sat for a few moments , extremely reduced by the plain evidence that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would eventually end . And what was worse , he had no one to confide in . For word as to this would bring back his public situation exactly where it had been before . And Berenice ! Stand Aileen ! The newspapers ! And more and more days in bed ! One thing he thought he should do was to return to New York . For there he would be close to Dr. James , and also he could see Aileen again and go over the problems that were troubling her . If he were going to die , there were things that should be put in order . As for Berenice , he could explain to her his need without telling her all in regard to this latest attack , and have her also return to New York . After arriving at this decision he very cautiously rose from his chair , and a few hours later was able to return to Pryor 's Cove , pretending that there was nothing wrong in any way . However , after dinner , Berenice , who was in a particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going all right . " Well , no , not exactly , " he replied . " I had a getter from Aileen complaining about conditions in New York : the work on the house , and that sort of thing . She thinks there is n't sufficient room being left for the pictures I 've added to the collection . And some of the dealers who have looked in on the alterations seem to agree with her , regardless of Pyne 's opinion . I 'm beginning to feel that I should go over , not only for that reason , but also to look after some of the follow-ups in connection with the loans that were made to me when I was there last . " " Are you sure you are strong enough to undertake the trip ? " asked Berenice , a look of anxiety in her eyes . " Quite , " replied Cowperwood . " As a matter of fact , I am feeling better than I have been for months . And I can not go too long without contact with New York . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a troubled tone . " Why , you will go with me , and , for convenience sake , you can stay at the Waldorf when you get there , incognito , of course "  --  a reply that modified the look of distress in her face . " But on different boats , as usual ? " " Unfortunately , that would be the best way , hard as it is for me to even think of it . You know so well , dear , the danger of publicity . " " Yes , I know . I understand how you feel about it . If you have to go , you must , and I 'll be right behind you on the next boat . When do we go ? " " Jamieson tells me the next boat sails Wednesday . Can you get ready by then ? " " I could be ready tomorrow if it were necessary , " replied Berenice . " Darling ! You are always so willing , so helpful  --  I do n't know what my life would be without you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put her arms around him , whispering : " I love you , Frank . So why should n't I do everything I can to help you ... " ONCE on the boat , Cowperwoodalone , spiritually alone , at last admitting to himself that neither he nor any man knew anything about life or its Creator . He now felt that for some reason he was facing a change which involved all this great and beautiful mystery as it related itself to him . He had cabled Dr. James to meet him at the dock , and this immediatelybrought the following reply : " Welcome to New York . I will be there to meet you . Yours , Monte Carlo Jeff . " A message which provided Cowperwood with a laugh and a peaceful night . Only , before he turned to rest , he took paper and ink and penned the following message to Berenice , who was traveling under the name of Kathryn Trent on the S.S. King Haakan : " We are only a day apart but to me it is worse than a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicinity comforts me and brings me rest . " On Sunday morning Cowperwood awoke feeling less vigorous and less physically secure than he had the night before . And by the time his valet had helped him dress , he felt greatly reduced in strength ; in fact , he returned to bed to rest for the entire day . At first , his entourage , which consisted of Jamieson ; Mr. Hartley , Jamieson 's assistant ; Frederickson , the valet , was not alarmed , as it was thought he was merely relaxing . But toward the late afternoon he asked Jamieson to call the ship 's physician , for he was feeling quite ill . Dr. Camden , after an examination , decided that he was a very sick man , with a temperature of 105  --  , and advised that his personal physician be notified to meet the boat in the morning and have an ambulance there . On hearing this news Jamieson took it upon himself to wire Aileen that her husband was very ill , that it was necessary to remove him from the boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest in regard to further arrangements . Whereupon Aileen answeredat once , saying that owing to the fact that Mr. Cowperwood'sresidence was being altered to house an additional art gallery , there was an undue amount of noise and confusion ; she therefore thought it wiser for him to go to the Waldorf-Astoria , where arrangements could be made for his proper care , and where . he would be decidedly more comfortable . After Dr. Camden had eased his patient by a shot of morphine , Jamieson communicated the contents of Aileen 's message to Cowperwood . " Yes , that would be much better , " he said weakly . " Make the arrangements . " But this disruption of all of his plans , and such thoughts as he was now able to indulge in , caused him to feel very weary . His house ! His art gallery ! His planned hospital ! The idea of having to return to London and his underground affairs ! Suddenly he found himself desiring not to think of anything or anyone , other than Berenice . And so he remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in process of being docked , and the hustle and bustle and movement all about him caused him to awaken to the fact that they were arriving . At this point , Dr. James , having chartered a pilot boat , boarded the S.S. Empress while it was still in the lower harbor , and after he had consulted Dr. Camden and Jamieson about such plans as had been made , walked into Cowperwood 's room . " Now , Frank , this is Jeff , " he announced , " and I want to know exactly how you 're feeling . This is something that will pass , I believe , as soon as I can administer the right sort of medicine . But I want you not to worry about anything . Just leave it to me , your old Monte Carlo pal . " " I knew when you came , Jeff , " said Cowperwood , weakly , " everything would be all right , " and he squeezed the doctor 's hand affectionately . " We 've made arrangements to move you to the Waldorf in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mind that , will you ? It 's really better that way , much easier on you , you know . " " No , " replied Cowperwood , " I have no objection . But I wish you could arrange so that I would n't be annoyed by the newspapermen , at least until I am settled at the hotel . I 'm not sure that Jamieson , will know how to handle them . " " Just leave it to me , Frank . I 'll take care of it . The important thing for you to do is to rest and say nothing at all , until I talk to you later . And now I 'll have to be going to take charge . " P249Just then Jamieson entered the room . " Come on , Jamieson , " said Dr. James , " the first thing we have to do is see the captain . " Whereupon they left the room together . Three-quarters of an hour later an ambulance that had been waiting in the street below was allowed to back up to Exit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no passengers still waiting to leave the ship . At the direction of Jamieson , two carriers bearing a canvas stretcher proceeded to Cowperwood 's suite , and he was carried to the waiting ambulance . The doors were closed , the driver sounded his gong , and drove away , while an astonished group of reporters standing a short distance away exclaimed , one to another : " What do you know about that ? We 've been double-crossed this time ! Who was that ? " Frustrated in their attempt to learn who had been so ill that it was necessary to remove him , or her , in an ambulance , it was not long before one of them , boasting a friendship with one of the nurses on the vessel , returned with the information that it was none other than Frank Algernon Cowperwood , the celebrated financier . However , as to what the nature of his illness was , or where he had been taken , these were items that had to be traced down . But when one reporter suggested getting in touch with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nearest telephone to inquire from Aileen if her husband had been taken off the S.S. Empress in an ambulance , and if so , where was he ? It was true , she replied ; he was ill , but it was also true that he would have been transferred to the Cowperwood mansion if it were not for the fact that the entire building was in process of alteration in order to make room for an additional art and statuary collection which later was to become the property of the city of New York . Meanwhile , it was also Mr. Cowperwood 's wish that he be transferred to the Waldorf-Astoria , where he could have such quiet and attention as at present he could not obtain in his own home . Accordingly , by one o'clock of this same day , the news of Cowperwood'sarrival and illness and present whereabouts was in every afternoon paper in the city , although , due to the precaution of Dr. James , no visitors were allowed without a written consent from the doctor himself , and three nurses were placed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berenice receivingalarming news concerning his illness , requested Dr. James to send the following telegram to her still on board ship : " Report of my illness greatly exaggerated . Do everything exactly as planned . Dr. James in charge . Will tell you what to.do . Affectionately , Frank . " In spite of the fact that this telegram brought such distressing news , Berenice was somehow consoled by the fact that he was able to wire her so reassuringly . And yet she was haunted by uncertainty as to the nature of this illness . At any rate , whatever the result , her place , as she felt , was beside him . Yet walking through the main salon of the vessel later in the American financier and London traction magnate , stricken on board S.S. Empress , and re-movedon arrival in New York to Waldorf-Astoria Hotel . " Stunned and grieved by these cold words in black and white , she was still relieved to learn that he was to be at the hotel instead of his home . She had a suite reserved there , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was the possibility of encountering Aileen , and this would be painful , not only for her but for Cowperwood . And yet he had asked her to come to the hotel , as originally planned , so he must have some procedure worked out . However , this new vulnerable social arrangement was such an extreme contrast to her protected seclusion at Pryor 's Cove that she now wondered if she had the necessary courage or stamina to go through with it . But even in the face of these difficulties and dangers she felt that she must be near him , regardless of consequences . For he needed her , and she must answer . that need . Once so decided , the following morning , as soon as the vessel docked and she had declared her luggage , she went to the hotel , where she calmly registered under the name of Kathryn Trent . But once within the privacy of her own suite , she was faced with the numerous angles of her situation . What to do ? For , as she knew , Aileen might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the problem , a call came from Dr. James , telling her that Cowperwoodwould like to see her , and that his suite was number 1020 . She thanked him very cordially and said she would go to him at once . Dr. James added that although Cowperwood was in no immediate danger , rest and , quiet being his principal needs at present , he had ordered that no one be allowed to see him for a few days , with the exception of herself . P251Upon arriving at his suite , she was ushered directly into his presence , where she found him lying propped up on pillows , looking pale and not a little distrait , but brightening as she neared him . She bent over and kissed him . " Darling ! I 'm so sorry . I was afraid that this trip might be too much for you . And I was not with you ! But Dr. James assures me that it is n't serious . You know you recovered from your first attack , and I 'm sure , with care , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if only I could be with you all of the time . I think I could nurse you back to health ! " ' " But Bevy , darling , " observed Cowperwood , " just to look at you makes me feel better . And this matter of your seeing me shall be arranged . Of course , there 's a lot of publicity now , and the less you are involved , the better I would feel . But I have explained the whole matter to Jeff , and he understands and sympathizes . And , better than that , he will keep in touch with you as to times and opportunitiesfor seeing me . There 's just one person , you know , that you will have to do your best to avoid . But if you will keep in touch with Dr. James from day to day , I think we can manage until I 'm out of this . As a matter of fact , I am sure of it . " " Darling , you are so brave , and you know that I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as cautious and circumspect as possible . Meanwhile , I 'll be loving you and praying for you constantly . " She bent over and kissed him again . THE sudden illness and collapse ofCowperwood , flashed first by the local New York papers to their readers , was nothing less than an internationalsensation . For it affected and included the interests and investments of thousands of persons , to say nothing of their banks and bankers . As a matter of fact , the day after he was stricken , reportersfrom the principal newspapers of England and France , and Europe in general , through the United and Associated press services ; interviewed not only Jamieson and Dr. James but also called upon distinguished financiers in the United States for comments as to what the effect of his death might be . Indeed , so numerous were the apprehensive comments and mis- givings on the part of some investors that most of the remaining managers of the London underground were compelled to express themselves as to the actual import of Cowperwood 's illness . For one , Mr. Leeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and who was said to have been very close to Cowperwood , was quoted as saying that " the necessary arrangements for every possiblecontingency arising from the possible indisposition of Mr. ' , Cowperwood at any time had long before been made . Complete harmony , " added Mr. Leeks , " exists in the entire Underground directorate . As to the future policy of this great system , I wish to say that there is not a trace of confusion or disorder . " Again , one William Edmunds , director of the Railway Equipment &; Construction Company of London , stated : " Everything is in perfect working order . The organization is so good that Mr. Cowperwood'sillness or temporary absence can make no difference . " Lord Stane made the following comment : " The Underground is in splendid condition , and its affairs have been so administered from the start , by Mr. Cowperwood himself , that his unavoidable absence can not bring about any serious injury to the system . Mr. Cowper-woodis too great an organizer to found any vast enterprise on the indispensability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ; ( his speedy recovery and return , for his is a welcome presence here . " While Dr. James had attempted to keep this publicity away from Cowperwood , there were a few people he could not very well restrain and had to admit . One was Cowperwood 's daughter , Anna , and his son , Frank , Jr. , neither of whom he had seen for a number of years . From his conversation with them he was able to sense the reaction of the public to his illness , and it was not unflattering , to say the least . Following these came Aileen , who was extremely disturbed by his physical state , for at this time he looked and felt very weak . Dr. James insisted that she wait for a later time to discuss any pressing problems , and she readily accepted his suggestion and considerately made her first visit a very short one . After Aileen departed , Cowperwood was mentally constrained to meditate on the various social and financial angles which his sudden illness had brought into being as problems which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned the choice of someone to take on his duties temporarily in the face of his present unavoidable ab-P253sence . Naturally , he first thought of Lord Stane , but considering his numerous and pressing interests , decided that Stane would not be the man . But there was one Horace Albertson , president of the St. Louis Electric Traction System , who , as he knew from previous financial relations , was one of the ablest railroad men in America . Albertson , he felt , should prove entirely satisfactory in such a crisis as this . And immediately following this thought he instructed Jamieson to see Mr. Albertson in St. Louis and present to him the entire problem , his reward to be whatever sum he felt he deserved . However , Mr. Albertson declined the offer , saying that he was highly honored , but his own labors were constantly increasing in volume and he could not consider retiring from the American field . This was a disappointment to Cowperwood , but one that he could understand and justify . Although it did , for a time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a cable from Stane and the directors of the London Underground stating that they had that day appointed Sir Humphrey Babbs , well-known to Cowperwood , to take his place temporarily at the head of the system . Aside from this cable , came several others from his London associates , includingElverson Johnson , emphasizing their unhappiness over his illness and their deep desire for his speedy recovery and return to London . Nonetheless , in spite of all their praises , Cowperwood 's mind was troubled by the somewhat complicated and ominous drift of all of his affairs at this time . For one thing , here was Berenice , his devoted love , risking so much for the rare opportunity of secretly visiting him at night , or in the early dawn , with the aid and connivance of Dr. James . And here again was Aileen  --  her lack of understanding of life in general , its inexplicable eccentricities and vagaries  --  also visiting him occasionally , unaware of the presence of Berenice in the hotel . He felt that he must try to live , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing ground physically . So much so that one day when Dr. James was alone with him in his room , he began talking to him about it . " Jeff , I 've been ill for about four weeks now , and I have the feeling that I am not getting any better . " " Now , Frank , " said James , quickly , " that 's not the right attitude to take . You must try to get well , and the chances are you will . Other cases as bad as yours have gotten better . "   " I know that , " said Cowperwood to his friend , " and naturally you want to encourage me . But I still have the feeling that I am not going to recover . And in connection with this , I would like you to call Aileen and ask her to come here and talk over some estate matters with me . I 've been thinking of this for some time , but now I feel I 'd better not wait any longer . " " Just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I do wish you would ' , not decide that you are not going to get well . It is n't good , you know . And besides , I think to the contrary . As a favor to me , you might try a little . " " I 'll try , Jeff , but please call Aileen , will you ? " " Why , certainly , Frank , but do n't talk too long , remember ! " And James retired to his own room , where he called Aileen onthe telephone and asked her to come over to see her husband . " Would you be good enough to come this afternoon , if possible , say around three o'clock ? " he asked her . She hesitated for a moment , and then replied : " Why , yes , ofcourse , Dr. James , " and accordingly at about the time agreed uponshe came , disturbed and wondering and not a little sad . Upon seeing her , Cowperwood experienced a sense of weariness , uch as for years he had often experienced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weariness . She was so sadly f. - . P ! lacking in that rare inner refinement t characterized a woman like Berenice . And yet , here she was , till is wife , and for that reason he felt that he owed her a reasonable degree of consideration in return for the kindness and affection which she had displayed at a time when he most needed them . And thus thinking , his mood softened somewhat toward her , and he reached out and took her hand as she greeted him . " How are you , Frank ? " she asked . " Well , Aileen , I 've been here four weeks now , and although the doctor thinks I am doing well enough , I realize that I am getting weaker all the time . And since there are a number of things I wanted to talk to you about , I thought I 'd send for you . Is there anything you would like to tell me first about the house ? " " Well , yes , a few things , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait until you are better , do n't you think ? " " But you see , Aileen , I do n't think I 'm going to get any better . P255And that 's the reason I wanted to see you now , today , " said Cowperwood , softly . Aileen hesitated and did not answer . " You see , Aileen , " he continued , " the bulk of my estate is going to you , although I 've taken care of some others in my will , such as my son and my daughter . But the great responsibility of the care of this estate is going to fall on you . It 's a large amount of money , and I want to know if you feel equal to the task ; and if so , if you will faithfully carry out the instructions I have written out for you in my will . " " Oh , yes , Frank , I will do everything you say . " He sighed inwardly , and continued : " Although I have made a will which gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason I feel the necessity of warning you of overconfidence in anyone ; for the moment I am gone , I 'm sure there will be any number of people who will come to you with this and that plan , to do something for this cause or the other , or this or that institution . I have tried to guard against that by instructing the executors to submit any plan they may have to you for your approval . You are to be the judge , and you must decide whether it is worthy or not . Dr. James , you know , is one of the executors , and he is the one on whose judgment I can rely . He is a man of not only great medical skill but goodness of heart and intention . I have told him that you may stand in need of advice , and he has promised me faithfully to advise you to the best of his knowledge and ability . I want to tell you that he is so honest a man that when I told him he was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , he refused to allow it , although he was willing to act as your advisor . So if ever you should find yourself troubled as to what to do , please go to him first and see what he thinks . " " Yes , Frank , I will do exactly as you say . If you believe in him , I certainly will also . " " Of course , " he continued , " there are specific provisions in my will to be taken care of after the beneficiaries are satisfied . One of these is the completion and preservation of my art gallery . I want the mansion kept intact as it now stands ; that is , as a museum for the benefit of the public . And since I have left plenty of money for its upkeep , it will be your duty to see that it is maintained in the best possible state . " In fact , Aileen , I do n't know if you ever realized how much that place has meant to me . It has helped me to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to devote myself . In building it and buying things for it , I have tried to bring into my life and yours the beauty which is entirely outside of cities and business . " And as Cowperwood talked on , Aileen at last realized to a degree , at least , and perhaps for the first time , what all this meant to him , , and again she promised to do everything as he directed . " There 's another thing , " he went on , " and that is the hospital . You know I have wanted for a long time to build one . It does n't have to occupy an expensive site . A rather convenient Bronx locationhas been suggested in my will . Furthermore , it is to be for the poor  --  not for people with , money who can afford to go elsewhere  --  and neither race , creed , nor color are to have anything to do with . ' ' the right of admission . " She sat there silently while he paused for a moment . " There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to you before , because I was n't certain how you would feel about it . I am having a tomb erected over in Greenwood Cemetery , and it 's very near completion : a beautiful copy of an ancient Greek design . It contains two bronze sarcophagi , one for me and one for you , if you choose to be buried there . " At this she stirred uneasily , for he seemed to be considering his prospective death as practically as he had taken his business affairs . " You say it is in Greenwood ? " she asked . " Yes , " said Cowperwood , solemnly . " And that it is already completed ? " " So nearly completed that I could be buried there if I died within a short time . " " Certainly , Frank , you are the strangest of men ! The idea of building your own tomb  --  and mine  --  and you are n't certain at all that you 're going to die of this . . . " j " Bu is tomb , Aileen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , with a slight i t i  --  his " voice . And besides , we 're all going to die sometime , and you might as well rest there with me ; that is , if you care to . " She remained silent . " Well , there it is , " he concluded , " and I feel it should be for the two of us , particularly since it has been built that way . However , if you feel you do not want to be there ... " P257But here she interrupted him . " Oh , Frank , let 's not talk about that now . If you want me there , I 'll be there . You know that , " and a restrained sob manifested itself in her voice . However , at this point the door opened and Dr. James came in to say that it was unwise for Cowperwood to talk any longer ; she might come another day if she would call up beforehand . She got up from where she had been sitting beside his bed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in again tomorrow , Frank , just for a little while , and if there is anything I can do , please have Dr. James call me . But you must get well , Frank . You must believe that you will . There is so much that you want to do . Try . . . " " Well , all right , dear , I will do my best , " he said , waving his hand and adding : " See you tomorrow . " She turned and passed out into the hall . Walking toward the elevators , sadly pondering their conversation , she noticed a woman just stepping out of an elevator . She stared , and , to her astonishment , realized that the woman was Berenice . They both stood as if transfixed for a few seconds , after which Berenice crossed the hall and opened a door and disappeared down a stairway leading to the floor below . Aileen , still transfixed , turned , with seeming determination to re-enter Cowperwood 's suite , but instead suddenly turned in the opposite direction toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and stood still . Berenice ! So here she was in New York , and obviously at Cowperwood 's request . Of course , at his request ! And he pretending even now that he was dying ! Would the man 's perfidy never reach a limit ? Imagine him asking her to come tomorrow ! And talking of the tomb in which she was to lie with him ! With him ! Well , this was the end ! Never I again would she . see him in this world , if they called her as many as a thousand times a day ! She would instruct her servants to ignore all calls from her husband , or his accomplice , Dr. James , or any other person who pretended to represent them ! As she entered the elevator , her mind was a mental storm center , a cyclone roaring with clashing waves of rage . She would tell the press about this scoundrel : his abuse and humiliation of a wife who had done so much for him ! She would repay him yet ! Outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the driver to drive , just drive , the while she repeated to herself , like a rosary of trebled length , all of the ills which she could conjure , P258that might be and would be , if she could manage , heaped upon Cowperwood . And as she rode , the vibration of her rage traveled directly back to Berenice . BERENICE , in the meantime , havingreached her room , sat there woodenly , finding herself powerless to think , so filled with fear was she , for Cowperwood as well as herself . Aileen might have returned to his apartment , and how dreadful the effect of that on him at this time ! It might actually bring about his death ! And how terrible it was that she could not do anything for him ! Finally , she thought of going to Dr. James and asking him how to defeat this vicious , mercilessmood on the part of Aileen . But she was held back by the fear of again meeting her . Perhaps she was in the hall , or in Dr. James ' room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at last it produced a practical idea . She went to the telephone and called Dr. James , and , much to her relief , he answered . " Dr. James , " she began , shakily , " this is Berenice . I want to know if you wo n't please be good enough to come to my room at once . Something dreadful has happened , and I am so unstrung and nervous I must talk to you ! " " Why , certainly , Berenice . I will come at once , " he replied . Then she added , in a most unsteady voice : " If you should see Mrs. Cowperwood in the hall , please do n't allow her to follow you here . " But here her voice broke off , and James , sensing danger , hung the phone up hurriedly and , seizing his medical kit , went directly to her apartment and knocked at the door . Berenice responded by whispering from behind the door : " Are you alone , Doctor ? " When he assured her he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What is the matter , Berenice ? What is all this ? " he asked , almost brusquely , at the same time studying her white face . " Why are you so terrified ? " " Oh , Doctor , I ca n't tell you . " She was actually trembling with fear . " It 's Mrs. Cowperwood . I saw her here in the hall as I wasP259coming in , and she saw me . Her expression was so savage that I am afraid for Frank . Do you know whether or not she has seen him since I left ? I have the feeling that she might have returned to his apartment . " " Certainly not , " said James . " I have just come from there . Frank is all right , quite safe . But here , " and taking a few small white pills from his medicine case he handed her one . " Take this , and do n't say anything more for a few moments . It will quiet your nerves , and then you can tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he motioned her to sit beside him . Gradually she showed signs of becoming more quiet . " Now , listen , Berenice , " he added , " I know that your situation here is a very difficult one . I have known it ever since you came here , but why are you so wrought up ? Do you expect Mrs. Cowperwood to attack you personally ? " " Oh , no , I am not worried about myself , " she replied , more calmly . " It 's Frank I 'm really worried about . He is so ill and so weak and helpless at this time , and I 'm afraid that she may say or do things that might hurt him so terribly he would not want to live . And , oh , he has been so liberal and so well-meaning toward her . And just now when he needs love , not hate , and after all he has done for her , she is ready to do I do n't know what  --  abuse him so violently that he may suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she always loses control of her emotions when she becomes jealous . " " Yes , I know , " said James . " He is a very greatman , who has married the wrong woman , and to tell you the truth , I feared something ' of this kind . I thought it unwise for you to be in the same hotel . However , love is a powerful force , and I saw how deeply you cared for each other when I was in England . But I also knew , as did many people , that his relations with Mrs. Cowperwood were unsatisfactoryto him . By the way , did you exchange any words with her ? " " Oh , no , " replied Berenice . " I just saw her as I stepped out of the elevator , and her anger and opposition , as she recognized me , were so real that I felt it through my whole body . It came to me that she might do something desperate to both of us , if she could . Besides , I was afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point Dr. James advised Berenice to stay in her suite until this storm subsided , and to wait until she heard from him . Above all , as he instructed her , she was not to say a word to Cowperwood about this when she saw him again . He was far too ill to endure it . In the meantime , as he patiently explained , he would brave the anger of Mrs. Cowperwood and call her , to determine , if possible , what she might be doing or planning to say publicly . And then he left Berenice to go to his own room to think the matter over . However , before he had time to reach Aileen on the telephone , one of the nurses came into his room to ask if he would not please step in and look at Mr. Cowperwood ; he seemed more restless than usual . When he did so , he found Cowperwood stirring around in his bed as though he were uncomfortable . And when he asked him how his visit with Aileen came out , he answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think . At least , I went over the most important points with her . But somehow , Jeff , I feel very tired , and exhausted from our long conversation . " " Well , I expected that . Next time , do n't talk for such a long time . And now here is something for you to take . It will give you a little rest for the present . " And with that he handed Cowperwood a powder with a glass of water , which he swallowed as Dr. James added : " Well , that will do for now , and I 'll look in on you a little later this afternoon . " Whereupon he returned to his own room and called Aileen , who by that time had returned home . Upon hearing his name announced by her maid , she came directly to the phone . James , in his most courteous tone , told her he was calling to find out how her visit with her husband had worked out , and asked if there was anything he could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she spoke . " Yes , Dr. James , you can help me very much by not calling me any more , if you please , for I 've just found out what has been going on all the time  --  in London and here  --  between my so-called husband and Miss Fleming . I know she has been living with him there and is now living with him under your eyes , and apparently with your aid and approval . And you want to know whether I had a satisfactory interview with him ! And that woman hiding in the same hotel ! It 's the most outrageous thing I ever heard of , and one which I 'm sure the public will be glad to hear about ! And it will , depend on that ! " And then , her voice almost breaking with rage , she added : " You , a doctor ! A man supposed to be concerned with the decencies of life ... " P261Whereupon Dr. James , sensing the fierceness of her rage , managed to interrupt her sufficiently to say , forcefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take exception to your accusations . I was called in on this case in a professional capacity , not as a judge of situations which are none of my making . And you have no right to judge the motives of a man about whom you know as little as you do about me . Whether you believe it or not , your husband is a very sick man , very , and if you make the grave error of giving out any story to the press , you will be hurting yourself a thousand times more than you could ever hurt him , or anyone connected with him . For he not only has powerful friends , but admirers , as you know  --  friends who will deeply resent any such action as you propose , and who will not fail him . If he dies , as he well may . . . well , judge for yourself how any such public attack as you have in mind will be received . " These cutting words reminded Aileen of some of her own indiscretionsin the not too distant past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she said : " I do n't want to discuss any of the personal angles of this matter with you or anyone else , Dr. James , so please do n't call me again on any matter connected with Mr. Cowperwood , no matter what happens . You have Miss Fleming there to wait on and comfort my husband . Let her take charge , and please do n't call me . I 'm tired of the whole wretched relationship . And that 's final , Dr. James . " Here the telephone clicked , for she had hung up . As Dr. James turned away from the phone , his face wore a faint smile . From his long years of professional experience with hystericalwomen , he knew that the force of her rage had spent itself in the hours since she had seen Berenice . For , after all , as he also knew , this was not a new story to Aileen . And he felt reasonably sure that her vanity would not allow her to give free reign to public utterances . She had not done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he felt . And with this much assurance , he went to call on and report to Berenice , whom he found still nervous and impatiently waiting to hear from him . He still smiled as he proceeded to explain that he felt sure that Aileen 's bark was worse than her bite . For although she had threatenedhim and Cowperwood and Berenice with exposure , still , after his talk with her , he had the definite feeling that her rage had spent itself and that nothing more of a violent nature was likely to occur . Now , he added , since Aileen had declared finally that she proposed never to see her husband again , it looked to him as if he should have to ask Berenice to take charge , and they would , both of them , see if they could not pull him through . She might take the evening nursing shift from four to twelve . " Oh , how wonderful ! " exclaimed Berenice . " I 'll be so happy to do all I possibly can to help him  --  anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must live ! He must get well and be free to do the things he has planned we must help him . " " I 'm very grateful to you for this . I know that he cares for you deeply , " said James , " and he will no doubt be much better in your care . " " Oh , Doctor , it is I who am truly grateful to you ! " she exclaimed , taking both of his hands in hers . COWPERWOOD 's ATTEMPT to clarify forAileen the significance of the wealth that would be hers at his death , and the necessity on her part for a practical understanding of the problems she would be likely to encounter as its custodian , instead of inducing an atmosphere of tender regard , left him with a sense of the probable futility of it all . And this because of his knowledge of her lack of realization of how important these matters were to him , as well as to her . For he knew well she could not read the characters and intentions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assurance could he have of the fulfillmentof the various ideals which most of his bequests embodied ? And this thought , instead of favorably affecting his mood in regard to living , really discouraged him . So much so that he was not only a little weary , but a little bored and spiritually dubious of the import of life itself . For how strange the almost unbroken irritability of their lives together , covering , as they did , a period of over thirty years ! There was , to begin with , his early enthusiasm for her when she was seventeen and he was twenty-seven , and then a little later his discoverythat her beauty and physical strength concealed also a lack of understanding that had kept her unaware of his financial andp263mental stature , at the same time that it caused her to consider that he was an unchanging possession of hers which was not to be modifiedby so much as a glance in any other direction than that which led to her . And yet , for all the storms that followed his least diversion , here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding on her part of the qualities in him which had slowly and yet surelyled him to his present wealth . Even so , he had finally discovered a woman whose temperament made his life supremely worth while . For he had found Berenice , 1 and she had found him . Together they had clarified themselves , each to the other . Her wondrous love shone in her voice , her eyes , her words , her touch . For bending over him from time to time , he could hear her say : " Darling ! Beloved ! This love of ours is not . just f for today , it is forever . It will live in you wherever you are , and " yours in me . We shall not forget . Darling , rest and be happy . " It was at this point in his meditations that Berenice , clad in the white uniform of a nurse , entered the room . He stirred at the sound of her familiar voice as she greeted him , and gazed as if not fully comprehending what his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her unusual beauty . With an effort he raised his head , and although obviously very weak , exclaimed : " You ! Aphrodite ! Goddess of the sea ! Immaculately white ! " She bent down and kissed him . " A goddess ! " he murmured . " The golden red of your hair ! The blue of your eyes ! " And then , pressing her hand , he drew her closer to him . " And now I have you with me . I see you as you beckoned to me that day in Thessalonika by the blue Aegean ! " " Frank ! Frank ! If only I were your goddess , forever and ever ! " She knew that he had become delirious , and tried to pacify him . " That smile , " went on Cowperwood . " Smile on me again . It islike sunshine . Hold my hands , my Aphrodite of the Sea ! " Berenice sat on the side of the bed and began to cry softly toherself . " Aphrodite , do n't ever leave me ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . At this point Dr. James walked into the room , and noting Cowperwood'scondition , went directly to him . Turning and surveying Berenice , he said : " Be proud , my dear ! A giant of the world salutes you . But leave us alone for a minute or two . I need to restore him . He is not going to die . " She left the room while the doctor administered a restorative . In a few moments , Cowperwood came out of his delirium , for he said : " Where is Berenice ? " " She will be with you in a moment , Frank , only now rest and quiet will be best for you , " said James . But Berenice heard him call her , and came in and sat on a little chair beside his bed , waiting . In a few moments he opened his eyes , and began talking . " You know , Berenice , " he said , as if they had been discussing the matter , " it is so important to keep the mansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , I know , Frank , " replied Berenice , softly and sympathetically . " You have always loved it so . " " Yes , I have always loved it . To leave the asphalt of Fifth Avenue and in ten seconds , after crossing the threshold , to be within a palm garden , walk through flowers and growing things , sit down among them , hear the plash of water , the tinkle of a rill dropping into the little pool , so that I heard notes of water music , like a brook in the cool greenness of the woods  --  " " I know , darling , " whispered Berenice . " But now you must rest . I will be right near you even when you sleep . I am your nurse . " And as Berenice went about her duties that night , and on every ther night , she was impressed by his unbroken interest in the any ( affairs which he could no longer possibly manage . One ay itm . the art gallery , next ay , and next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , any more than did Dr. James , Cowperwood had only a very few more days to live . And yet , during such hours as she spent with him , he seemed more cheerful , except that after talking for a moment or two , he now invariably manifested a great weariness and a desire to sleep . " Let him sleep as much as possible , " counseled Dr. James . " He is merely conserving his strength . " A statement which discouraged Berenice greatly . So much so that she asked if something more could not be done for him . " No , " replied James . " Sleep is truly the best thing for him , and he may pull through . I am trying the best restoratives I know , but we can only wait . He may take a turn for the better . " P265Only he did not take a turn for the better . Instead , forty-eight hours before he died he took a definite turn for the worse , which caused Dr. James to send for his son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter , who was now Mrs. Templeton . But not Aileen , as his daughter and son noticed when they arrived . When asked why Mrs. Cowperwood was not present , Dr. James explained to them that for reasons of her own she had refused to come to visit him any more . However , although they had known of the existing estrangementbetween Aileen and Cowperwood , his son and daughter still had their own misgivings as to why she refused to come to see Cowperwood at this crucial time , and they felt obligated to inform her as to his condition . Therefore , they hurried to a public telephone and called her . But , much to their surprise , they found she was not in a mood to consider anything in connection with him or them , asserting that Dr. James and Miss Fleming , having arranged Cowperwood 's affairs with his consent and with no regard for her wishes , surely could take care of everything . She flatly refused to come . And so , while they were stunned by this seeming cruelty on Aileen 's part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to watch the outcome of his turn for the worse . For fear controlled all present : Dr. James , Berenice , and Jamieson , all of whom stood by helpless for the want of a single clarifying idea . They waited for hours , the while they listened to his heavy breathing or periods of silence , until suddenly , twenty-four hours later , as if seeking to conclude a great weariness , he stirred sharply , even half-rose on one elbow as though looking about , and then as suddenly fell back and lay still . Death ! Death ! There it was  --  irresistible and bleak in the face of all of them ! " Frank ! " cried Berenice , stiffening and staring as if in supreme wonder . She hurried to his side and fell to her knees , seizing his damp hands and covering her face with them . " Oh , Frank , my darling ; not you ! " she cried out , and then drooped slowly to the floor , half-fainting .   THE consternation that followed Cowperwood'sdeath involved so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several minutes all stood as if stupefied . Of the entire group , the doctor was the calmest and most resourceful in his thoughts and actions , his first direction being that he and Jamieson remove Berenice to one of the couches that were in his room . After doing this , he suggested to Jamieson that he call up Mrs. Cowperwood at once in order to obtain from her instructions as to the burial . This inquiry , when made by Jamieson , resulted in a most shockingand disturbing reaction on the part of Aileen , a reaction plus an attitude which posed a problem that was seemingly insurmountablewithout resulting in practically a national scandal . " Why do you ask me ? " she said . " Why do n't you ask Dr. James and Miss Fleming ? They have been in complete charge of his affairs ever since he has been here , and before . " " But , Mrs. Cowperwood , " said Jamieson , astounded . " This is your husband . Do you mean to say that you do not wish to have him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her the sharp and staccato reply : " I have been personally ignored and lied to by Mr. Cowperwood , and also by his doctor and his mistress . Let them arrange to have his body sent to a funeral parlor and have the funeral from there . " " But , Mrs. Cowperwood , " insisted Jamieson , in an agitated voice , " this is a most unheard-of proceeding . All the newspapers will find out . Surely you would n't like that in connection with so great a figure as your husband . " But at this point Dr. James , hearing this shocking statement , came forward and took the telephone receiver from Jamieson . " Mrs. Cowperwood , this is Dr. James , " he said , coldly . " I am the physician , as you know , who was called in by Mr. Cowperwood when he came back to this country . Mr. Cowperwood is no relative of mine , and I have served him as I would any other patient , you included . But if you persist in this astounding attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property you are to inherit , I assure you that you will never be done with the scandal of it.  |p267It  will follow you to the end of your days . Surely you must realize the significance of that . " He waited for a second , but there was silence on her part . " Now , I am not asking you to do me any favor , Mrs. Cowperwood , " he went on . " Only yourself . Certainly his body can be re moved to an undertaker 's establishment , and buried anywhere , if that is what you wish . But is it ? As you know , the press can learn from me or from the undertaker as to what has become of his body . But once more , and finally , for your own sake , I am asking you to think this over , for if you do as you say , I will see that tomorrow 's papers print the whole story . " At this point he stopped talking , waiting and hoping for a more humane reply . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung up the receiver . Whereupon he turned to Jamieson , saying : " That woman is , for the time being , not wholly sane . We 'll simply have to take this matter into our own hands and act for her . Mr. Cowperwood is so well liked by his own servants that I am sure there will be no difficulty in reaching them , so that , without her knowledge , his body can be transferred to the house and remain there until it can be properly removed to his tomb . This is something that we can and must do . We can not possibly allow this tragedy to occur . " And taking his hat , he went out , but not before looking in on Berenice , who by then had recovered her composure , and asking her to return to her room and wait there until she heard from him . " Do not despair , Berenice . Believe me , this will all be arranged in the most correct and unobtrusive manner possible . I can promise you that , " and he pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cowperwood 's body taken to an undertaking establishment located near the hotel . Next , he intended to consult with Jamieson as to the character and mentality of the Cowperwood servants . Surely one or two of them could be depended on for assistance . For he was morally convinced that Aileen should not have her way . He might have to overstep his rights , but he saw no other course . Long before this he had sensed the basis of the difference between her and Cowperwood . She was , as he had seen for himself , really deeply in love with her husband , but so jealous of his every action as to make her dream of happiness a vehicle of pain.  | Curiously enough , at this very difficult moment , Jamieson was called upon by one Buckner Carr , head butler at the Cowperwood home , a man who had been in Cowperwood 's service since his Chicago years . His purpose in calling , as it turned out , was to convey to Jamieson not only his great sorrow and dismay at Mr. Cowperwood 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had overheard , and which seemed to indicate that Mrs. Cowperwood was charging her husband with unjust accusations and , most terrible of all , refusing to allow him now to be brought into his own home , he desired to offer his services toward averting such a tragedy . When Dr. James returned to the hotel , he found Jamieson and Carr together , and he immediately explained to them the plan he had worked out in his own mind . He had instructed the undertaker , he said , to prepare the body for burial , provide a suitable casket , and await further directions . The problem now was to decide when it could be transferred to the mansion , and whether the servants would be there to assist in the arrangement of a secret and silent reception of the body , together with the labor of taking it to the proper room , and in the most noiseless fashion , in order that Mrs. Cowperwood would not be aware of its arrival , at least until the following morning . Did Buckner Carr believe that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he were now allowed to return to the Cowperwood home for an hour or two he would call back and state whether the exact conditions outlined by Dr. James could be fulfilled . After which he left , and at the end of two hours called on the telephone to say that the best time would be between ten o'clock in the evening and one o'clock in the morning ; all of the servants were anxious to help , and the house would be dark and silent . And , in consequence , as planned , the transfer of Cowperwood 's body in its casket was executed , at one o'clock in the morning , while Carr outside silently patrolled a practically deserted street . The faithful servant followers of their former master had arranged the large living room on the second floor for the reception of the richly ornamented casket in which he lay . As he was being carried in , one of them stood before Aileen 's door , listening , in anticipation of any least stir . Thus the unheralded funeral cortege of Frank Algernon Cowper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Aileen once more united in their own home . No TROUBLESOME thoughts or dreamsconcerning the entire proceedings of the night disturbed Aileen before the light of early morning awakened her . Although usually she felt disposed to linger in her bed for a period , on this occasion , hearing a noise as though some heavy object had dropped to the floor of the balcony below , and fearing that it might have been a valuable Greek marble recently purchased and more recently temporarily placed , she arose and descended the staircasethat led to the balcony . Looking around curiously as she walked past the large double doors leading into the main drawing room , she went directly to the newly placed art piece , but found it quite in order . Yet , as she turned about to retrace her steps , and as she again approached the doors to the drawing room , she was startled by the presence and appearance of a large black , heavily draped , oblong box , standing in the center of the huge room . A shivering cold swept across her body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then she turned as if to run away , but then , pausing , returned again to the entrance of the room and stood there , amazed and staring . A coffin ! God ! Cowperwood ! Her husband ! Cold and dead ! And he had come to her , although she had refused to go to him when he was alive ! With trembling and remorseful steps she walked forward to gaze on his cold and death-stilled body . The high forehead ! The distinguished , well-shaped head ! The smooth brown hair , even at this time not gray ! The impressive features , all of which were so familiar to her ! The whole figure suggesting power , thought , genius , which the world had so readily recognized in him from the beginning ! And she had refused to go to him ! She stood stiffly , inwardly regretting something  --  his own errors and hers . And the endless , almost inhuman storms that had come and gone between them . And yet , here he was , at home at last ! At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final defiance of her will , emphasized by his being here , aroused her to anger Who had brought him , and how ? At what hour ? For only the previous evening , she , by her orders and commands to the servants , had barred all doors . Yet here he was ! Obviously , his , not her , friends and servants must have collaborated to have done this for him . And so plainly now , all would be anticipating a change of attitude on her part , and if so , all the customary and formal last rites due to any such distinguished man . In other words , he would have won . It would appear as though she had altered her views and condoned his unfettered self-directing actions . But no , never should they do this to her ! Insulted and triumphed over to the very last ! Never ! And yet , even as she declared her defiance to herself , there he lay , and even as she gazed on him , there was the sound of footsteps behind her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the butler , approached , a letter in his hand , saying : " Madam , this has just been delivered at the door for you . " And although at first she gestured as if to wave him away , he had no more than turned his back when she exclaimed : " Give it to me ! " And then , tearing it open , she read : Aileen , I am dying . When this reaches you , I will be no more . I know all my sins and all those you charge me with , and I blame onlyself . But I can not forget the Aileen who helped me through my prison ays in Philadelphia . Yet it will not help me now , or either of us , to say I am sorry . But somehow , I feel that in the depths of your heart you will forgive me , once I am gone . Also it comforts me to know that you will be taken care of . I have arranged for all that , as you know . So now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank , no more ever ! A conclusion on his part which caused Aileen to go forward to the casket and take his hands and kiss them . And then , after gazing at him for a moment , she turned and hurried away . However , a few hours later , Carr , having been the recipient , through Jamieson and others , of various requests , was compelled to consult with Aileen concerning procedure in connection with the burial . The requests for permission to attend were so numerous that finally Carr was forced to bring forward a list of names , so long a list that it caused Aileen to say : " Oh , let them come ! What harm can it do now ? Let Mr. Jamiesonand Mr. Cowperwood 's son and daughter arrange everythingP271as they please . I will keep to my room , as I am not well enough to help in any way . " " But , Mrs. Cowperwood , would n't you be willing to have a minister present to pronounce the last rites ? " asked Carr , a suggestion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carr 's religiousnature . " Oh , yes , let one come . It can do no harm , " said Aileen , as her thoughts wandered back to the extreme religiosity of her parents . " But limit the number of those who are to come here to fifty , no more "  --  a decision which caused Carr to get in immediate touch with Jamieson and Cowperwood 's son and daughter , in order to inform them that they were to go ahead with such funeral arrangements as they felt appropriate . This news , reaching Dr. James ' ears , caused him to heave a sigh of relief , at the same time that he proceeded to have the many admirers of Cowperwood informed of this fact . AMONG the friends of Cowperwood whocalled at the mansion that same afternoon , and the morning following , those whose names were on Buckner Carr 's list were allowed to enter to view the body now lying in state in the spacious drawing room on the second floor . The others were advised to attend the tombside ceremonial at Greenwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meantime , Cowperwood 's son and daughter had called on Aileen , and it was arranged that they were to ride with her in the first mourner 's carriage . By that time , however , every New York newspaper was ablaze with the so-called sudden end of Cowperwood , who only six weeks before had arrived in New York . Because of his great number of friends , the articles stated , the funeral services would be attended by intimate friends of the family only : a statementwhich , however , did not deter many people from going out to the cemetery . Accordingly , the next day at noon , the funeral cortege began forming in front of the Cowperwood mansion . Groups of people gathered on the streets outside to observe the spectacle . Following the hearse was the carriage containing Aileen , Frank A. Cowperwood , Jr. , and Cowperwood 's daughter , Anna Templeton . And then ,   one by one , the other carriages moved into line , and proceeded along the highway , under an overcast sky , until finally they passed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounted a long incline , bordered by heavy trees , behind which ranged stones and monuments of all descriptions . About a quarter of mile in , as the drive continued to rise , a roadway branched off to the right , and a few hundred feet farther on , between great trees , the tomb loomed solemnly high and majestic . It stood alone , no other monument being within thirty feet of it , a gray , austere , and northern version of a Greek temple . Four gracefulcolumns of modified Ionic design formed the " porch " and supporteda plain triangular pediment , without decoration or religious symbol of any sort . Above the doors of the tomb , in heavy squarecutletters , was his name : FRANK ALGERNON COWPERWOOD . The three graduated platforms of granite were piled high with flowers , and the massive bronze double doors stood wide open , awaiting the arrival of the distinguished occupant . As all must have felt who viewed it for the first time , this was a severely impressive artistic achievement in the matter of design , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area . And as her carriage came into full view of the tomb , Aileen was again and finally impressed by her husband 's power of self-presentation . But even as she thought this , she closed her eyes , as if trying to shut out the sight of the tomb , and seeking to revive her last impression of him as he stood vividly alive and self-assertive before her . Her carriage waited until the hearse had reached the door of the tomb , and the heavy bronze casket was carried up and placed among the flowers , before the minister 's rostrum . Following that , the occupantsof the carriages emerged and crossed over to a large marquee tent set up in front of the tomb , under the shelter of which benches and chairs awaited them . In one of the carriages Berenice sat silently beside Dr. James , gazing at the tomb that was to seal her beloved away from her forever . Tears she could not cry , and would not . For why seek to oppose an avalanche which had already gone so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? At any rate , such was her mood or reaction to all of this . However , a word that repeated itself over and over in her mind was the word : " Endure ! Endure ! Endure ! " After all of the friends and relatives had settled themselves , thep273Episcopal clergyman , Reverend Hayward Crenshaw , came forward and took his place on the rostrum , and in a few moments , when all had become very quiet , he began to speak , his utterances grave and clear : " I am the resurrection and the life , saith the Lord ; he that believeth in me , though he were dead , yet shall he live ; And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die . " I know that my Redeemer liveth , and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth ; and though this body be destroyed , yet shall I see God ; whom I shall see for myself , and mine eyes shall behold , and not as a stranger . " We brought nothing into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing out . The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away ; blessed be the name of the Lord . " Behold , thou hast made my days as it were a span long ; and mine age is even as nothing in respect of thee ; and verily every mari living is altogether vanity . " For man walketh in a vain shadow , and disquieteth himself in vain : he heapeth up riches , and can not tell who shall gather them . " And now , Lord , what is my hope : truly my hope is even in Thee . " When thou with rebukes doth chasten man for sin , Thou makest his beauty to consume away , like as it were a moth fretting a garment : every man therefore is but vanity . " Lord , thou has been our refuge from one generation to another . " Before the mountains were brought forth , or ever the earth and the world were made ; Thou art God from everlasting and world without end . " Thou turnest man to destruction : again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " For a thousand years in Thy sight are but as yesterday ; when it is past , and as a watch in the night . " As soon as thou scatterest them they are even as asleep ; and fade away suddenly like the grass . " In the morning it is green , and groweth up ; but in the evening it is cut down , dried up , and withered . " For we consume away in Thy displeasure , and are afraid of thy wrathful indignation . " Thou hast set aside our misdeeds before Thee ; and our secret sins in the light of Thy countenance . " For when Thou art angry , all our days are gone ; we bring our years to an end , as it were a tale that is told .   I " The days of our age are three score years and ten ; and though men be so strong that they come to four score years ; yet is their strength then but labor and sorrow ; so soon passeth it away , and we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom . " Glory be to the Father , and to the Son , and to the Holy Ghost . " As it was in the beginning , is now , and ever shall be : world without end , Amen . " The casket was then lifted by the pallbearers and carried into the tomb and placed in the sarcophagus , while the minister knelt and prayed . Aileen having refused to enter , the other mourners remained with her . And shortly afterward , when the minister came outside , the heavy bronze doors were closed , and the burial services for Frank Algernon Cowperwood were over . The clergyman went over to Aileen to offer a few words of cornfort ; the friends and relatives began to leave , and soon the space about the tomb was empty . However , Dr. James and Berenice lingered a while in the shadow of a large birch tree , and then walked slowly down the slope along a winding path , as Berenice did not wish to leave with the others . Walking down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the last resting place of her beloved , as it stood high and proud in anonymity , the name not being visible from where she stood . High and proud , and yet small , under the protective elms grown tall around it . BECAUSE of the troubled state of hermind following the illness and death of Cowperwood , Berenice decided that it would be best for her to remove to her own home on Park Avenue , which had been closed during her absence in England . Now that she was uncertain as to her future , she would use it as a retreat , temporarily , at least , from prying contacts with the local press . Dr. James agreed with her decision , believing that it would be best for him also if he could truthfully say that she had departed and he did not know her presentwhereabouts : a ruse that subsequently worked very well , for having answered a number of times that he knew nothing morep275than the newspapers did , the inquiries ceased as far as he was concerned . Nonetheless , from time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not only to her disappearance , but her possible whereabouts . Had she returned to London ? And to make sure of that , the London papers queried whether she had returned to her former residence at Pryor 's Cove : a series of inquiries that brought the unsatisfactory news that although her mother was there , she stated that she knew nothing of her daughter 's plans , and that they would have to wait until she obtained that information herself . This reply was prompted by the receipt of a cable from Berenice requesting her mother to furnish no information until she heard from her . While Berenice got some satisfaction out of outwitting the reporters , she found she was quite lonely in her own home , and spent most of her evenings reading . However , she was shocked by a special feature article in one of the New York Sunday papers which dealt entirely with herself and her previous relations with Cowperwood . While she was referred to as his ward , the whole tenor of the article tended to single her out as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort and social pleasures in general : an interpretation and presentation of herself which irritatedas well as pained her greatly . For as she saw herself , then and before , she was wholly concerned with the beauty of life , and such creative achievements as tended to broaden and expand its experiences . However , as she now felt , this type of article was likely to be repeated and even reproduced in other papers , abroad as well as in her own country , for it was obvious that she had been singled out as a romantic and dramatic personality . What could she do about it ? Where go to live to get away from such publicity ? In her troubled and somewhat confused state of mind , she walked about the library of her home , the shelves of which were crowded with long-neglected volumes , and haphazardly withdrawing one of the books , she opened it casually and her eyes fell on the following words : Part of myself is the God within every creature , Keeps that nature eternal , yet seems to be separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Made of Prakriti.
