THE JOURNALS OF ANDRE GIDE ( 380 pp. ) - Translated , with an Introduction and Notes , by Justin O'Brien-Knopf ( $5 ) . <P> " Dare to be yourself , " wrote Andre Gide in his diary at 22 . " My mind is becoming voluptuously impious and pagan . I must stress that tendency . " If he felt like a pagan , he still acted like a Protestant ; he carried a pocket Bible everywhere with him . But he was always seesawing between the assurances of prayer and the doubts of spiritual confusion . Twenty-one years later , he confided to his journal : " Catholicism is inadmissible . Protestantism is intolerable . And I feel profoundly Christian . . . . From day to day I put off and carry a little farther into the future my prayer : may the time come when my soul , at last liberated , will be concerned only with God ! " <P> Gide 's famous Journals have been praised in hushed tones by his admirers ever since their Paris publication in 1939 . This first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others are promised before 1950 ) , is apt to get about the same degree of critical genuflection-and popular indifference-that French Man of Letters Gide has learned to expect . At 77 , it is unlikely that he will live to see his popularity catch up with his reputation ( based mainly in the U.S. on one novel , The Counterfeiters ) . A handful of intellectuals have made a cult of his uncompromising intellectualism ; others have sought out his books , having been assured that they might be shocked . But more readers have been discouraged by his stripped , austere style and involved ethical themes than have been shocked by Gide 's involved and discreet researches into homosexuality . <P> In 1906 , when he was 36 , Gide wrote in his Journals : " Never a man , I shall never be anything but an aged child . I live with all the incoherence of a lyric poet , but two or three ideas , crosswise in my brain and rigid like parallel bars , crucify every joy . . . . " Certainly there is little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Touchy and lacking creative confidence , he worked from compulsion and usually despaired of the results , cringed before criticism , sought solace in voracious reading and five-hour-long sessions at the piano . <P> Gide 's poems , plays and novels were ignored by the French public from the first ( he was 67 when he wrote his first bestseller , Return from the U.S.S.R. ) . Buttressed by an independent income , he went on writing as he pleased , traveled in Europe and Africa , financed and helped to edit a Paris literary review ( Nouvelle Revue Franfaise ) that acquired a small but secure world reputation . He had married his cousin Emmanuele , but the Journals make it clear that it was a marriage of convenience . ( " But of everything concerning Emmanuele I forbid myself to speak here . " )
