The phone jangled in the Pennsylvania farmhouse at 2 a.m . A sleepy man answered it , snapped wide awake . The Navy needed more bean soup . Soon , from a nearby factory , a truck loaded with big black cans rolled out , sped to the Philadelphia airport . The cans were hustled into a plane , flown to San Francisco , then on to Pearl Harbor . There they were dumped into a waiting boat . It chuffed out to sea , met a ship that had been burning for three days . The cans were tossed to the exhausted crew . Quickly , the bean soup in the big black cans snuffed out the fire . <P> Since World War II began , such emergencies have become routine for Philadelphia 's National Foam System , Inc . Its stocky , energetic president , Fisher Longstreth Boyd , 57 , rolls out of bed in the bleaker hours like any fireman to dispatch his fire-fighting foam , which the Navy calls " bean soup , " to fight fires around the globe . <P> New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family , James Boyd , invented the first rubber-lined cotton hose to replace the riveted leather hose then in use . He proudly received a patent signed by President James Monroe himself . Ever since , the Boyds have been inventing and manufacturing equipment to fight fires . To learn the tricks , unbookish Mr. Boyd left the University of Pennsylvania ( he was having too much fun to bother about graduating anyway ) , and went to work in his father 's businesses , James Boyd &; Brother , and National Fire Protection Co . He decided to think up a few tricks of his own . He concentrated on chemical foams which , when mixed with water , form a thick , snowy blanket of carbon dioxide bubbles , cutting off oxygen and thus smothering fires . <P> Although such foams had been in use for 50 years , Boyd thought he could invent a better one-and did . To manufacture and sell it , he formed National Foam , soon was doing a tidy worldwide business selling foam and equipment to protect oilfields and refineries in Ploesti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his chemistry-smart vice president , George Gordon Urquhart , he turned a second trick : creation from soybeans of a new super-efficient foam , which he called Aer-O-Foam . <P> More Production . A war-hating Quaker , Mr. Boyd did not think of his foams as war materiel until the Army gave him a sizable order . Early in ' 42 the Navy swamped him with an order for 200,000 gallons , almost a year 's production for his small , old-fashioned factory . <P> <P> Promptly , National Foam broke ground for a new plant outside Philadelphia , turned out its first batch of bean soup seven weeks later . The Navy piled on orders . It put a generous supply aboard its fighting ships and stockpiled it all over the world . In one Pacific sea fight 118 warship fires were reportedly snuffed out by foam . And Foam 's gross fizzed up from less than $500,000 into $6.000,000 this year .
