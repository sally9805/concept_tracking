txt Those Australian Brides Referring to the letter of Miss Stella Gordon , I think I can give a simple explanation of why Australian brides can come over here , although American soldiers have to wait for shipping space . I came over from Australia last fall on a neutral boat which had accommodation for only twenty-two passengers . Six of them were Australian brides . There were only first-class cabins and therefore the travel was rather expensive . It is obvious that the American Government can not send our soldiers home on neutral ships . Besides the high costs and the fact that these costs would have to be paid to foreign countries , it would endanger these ships , because , having American soldiers on board . they would no more be acknowledged as neutral by the enemy .
