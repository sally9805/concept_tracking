When a U.S. contractor set out to build a building or a road , he ordered cement from as many as ten plants . The nearest might be next door , the farthest 1,000 miles away . But when the cement was delivered , it all came at the same price , no matter whether it had been shipped one mile or 1,000 . The " multiple basing point system " worked that way . <P> Under this cozy arrangement , the base prices of cement were fixed at certain " basing point " plants across the country . Beyond the base price the buyer also paid freight costs from the nearest basing point plant . All cement plants in the U.S. thus charged the same price for cement laid down at any one job . The plants closer to the consumer than the basing point plant tacked on a " phantom freight " which was more than the shipping cost ; the plants farther away charged a freight which was less ( and took less profit ) . <P> Off with the Old . Last week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point system illegal . It upheld the Federal Trade Commission in its eleven-year-old antitrust suit against the Cement Institute and its 74 member companies . Said the Court : " The system is a handy instrument to bring about elimination of any kind of price competition . " In fact , said the Court , cementmakers had used the system to suppress competition by 1 ) boycotts , 2 ) price cuts ( against plants refusing to play ball ) , 3 ) identical bids to cement users , and 4 ) opposition to the building of new plants . <P> FTC lost no time in cashing in on its victory . Two days later it ordered 37 brickmakers to stop using the multiple basing point system , and broadcast a warning to all users-steel , farm machinery , chemicals , etc. - to cut it out . FTC said that it would proceed with suits and complaints now on file against such industries as steel , metal lath and conduits . <P> What the FTC wanted , in effect , was an f.o.b. system such as automakers use , with consumers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freight to the point of delivery . For many a consumer close to a plant , this would mean a price cut . Those far away might find prices boosted , at least as long as materials were scarce . <P> On with the New ? As expected , many an industry yelped in protest . They argued that the system had actually helped competition : it had kept small producers from being put out of business by price-cutting mammoths . U.S. Steel 's Chairman Irving S. Olds cried that elimination of basing points would result in wide dislocations of industry . He appealed to Congress to nullify the Court 's decision with a new law . But there was no disputing FTC 's stand that the system had caused cementmakers , and many another manufacturer , to set identical-and often rigidly high-prices on products with little regard for competitive conditions . They might find it hard to convince Congress that this was the free competition they said it was .
