txt More than 500 representatives of parents ' organizations in Manhattan , the Bronx and Richmond attended a special meeting yesterday afternoon in THE NEW YORK TIMES Hall , formerly the Little Theatre , in West Forty-fourth Street be ' tween Broadway and Eighth Avenue . to hear Mayor La Guardia and others tell what the city is doing to protect their children in case of air raids , and how school and family can best cooperate for indi ' vidual and social welfare . The meeting was held under the joint auspices of the Board of Education and THE NEW YORK TIMES , which will sponsor another meeting in the same place at 1:30 o'clock this afternoon for representatives from Brooklyn and Queens . Mayor La Guardia , who called the plan of bringing parents ' representatives together to explain the reasons back of air-raid rules " very useful , " said the most urgent thing to guard against was panic , which could cost more lives than direct bomb hits . Ignore Hysterics , He Urges He urged people not to be affected by any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition during an air raid , and go right on about their own business . The promotion of panic is used by the Nazis as a war weapon , he added , and fifth columnists here might try to do it as they did in Belgium , where they caused the roads to become so blocked with refugees that troops could not use them for defense . The people have been directed to stay indoors in case of raids , he explained , because if everybody tried to get out of the skyscrapers in our business districts at the same time " the police have estimated the bodies would lie six or seven deep in the streets and at the subway entrances . " As to the special problem of protecting school children the Mayor emphasized that the mental as well as the physical protection of the children must be considered . There must be no unnecessary interference with their normal life , their school and play hours , and the like , he went on . Parents and teachers should keep calm so as to set a good example . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact with children . Every teacher must be trained to stay with her class until it is safe . He promised that the schools would work out a program on dismissals in air raids , especially as to when glasses should be dismissed . The instructions sent out from Washington regarding this problem , he explained , were intended only as a guide , and were not expected to apply to every city , town and rural community , or even every school in any community , regardless of local conditions . New York City has all types of schools from the most modern urban to the almost rural type . The rules will be uniform where uniformly applicable , but will be flexible to meet varying conditions . Army Sends Raid Warnings Explaining that the Army gives the city three notices of air-raid warnings , he said nothing happens 99 times out of 100 after the first or preliminary notice is given , and nothing happens eight times out of ten after the second notice , ' but when we get the third notice we give the alarm . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added , enemy aircraft are supposed to be half an hour to an hour distant . Illustrating his talk with a ' pointer and a map , he said that while the relative positions of the Allies and the Axis remained as they are , " it would be very foolish to turn the children out of school on the first call ; we will have many alarms when nothing happens . " " It is necessary to cause the least possible disturbance to the children under the conditions that I exist , and that is why the Board of Education will have to decide at what point the children will have to be sent home , " he added . " With your cooperation I 'm quite sure we 'll work it out . " Although under existing condi. tions he did not think regular blackouts necessary , he said they would be ordered in all likelihood if Hitler seized the Azores , the I Cape Verde Islands or Dakar , or got the use of the French fleet . School Officials Speak Dr. Harold G. Campbell , Superintendent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city and that he was " living up to It twenty-four hours a day , " and then introduced Dr. C. Frederick Pertsch , assistant superintendent in charge of civilian defense for the Board of Education . Dr. Pertsch said that all things being equal , it was wise to disperse large groups of . people when raids were impending if sufficient time was given . If the schools received no warning except the siren that gives the public alert , he went on , they must keep all the children indoors , sending them to quarters selected in advance as the safest in each school  --  usually in corridors , away from windows . However , he said , if the school authorities got enough advance notice , they could send home all children living in the immediate neighborhood , except the physically handicapped . They needed at least twenty minutes preliminary warning , he continued , as five minutes was required to get the children into their clothes and lined up with their teachers downstairs , and ten minutes to march them through the streets to their homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets might be expected any moment . He said it had been arranged to have the younger children escorted home and the older ones sent home . In the high schools , most of which are of modern construction and 95 per cent of whose students live more than 10 minutes away , it has been decided to keep them in the schools . Under the new regulations of the Office of Civilian Defense , he continued , the schools are not to send children home unless the Army requests it and there is ample time for them to get there before the bombs begin to fall . He said he understood the 0 . C. D. favored the retention of the children in school , but felt this should be thoroughly discussed . Dr. Pertsch urged that parents who might have to be away from home during school hours arrange to have some one in the neighborhood take care of their children if they should be sent home . " In the unexpected drill last Tuesday , " he added , " children were sent out of school through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alert signal had been given  --  the very thing we oppose ? and some , finding their parents not at home , went down into the streets or sat on steps , exposing themselves to the greatest danger . " Parents Urged to Set Example He also urged parents not to rush to schools after the alert is given , not to telephone to the schools during or immediately after an alert , and not to spread rumors , but to set an example of self-control . Adding that he understood " one or two of our teachers were panicky during the drills , " he said rehearsals would be held to " improve and routinize all procedures . " Deputy Chief Inspector Arthur W. Wallender , in charge of civilian defense for the Police Department and one of the American defense commission that studied British civilian defenses earlier this year , said the War Room at Police Headquarters would notify the schools and the Fire Department first of all , as soon as it got word of an impending air raid from the Army Interceptor Command . If telephone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police had a corps of messengers to give notice . Assistant Chief John J. McCarthy , in charge of civilian defense foz. the Fire Department , said auxiliary fire companies would be set up within 100 to 200 feet of many schools . While the auxiliary firemen , expected soon to number 60 , - 000 , were waiting for their equipment , he addecl , New York had the pledge of many fire companies from the metropolitan area to come to its aid in case of need . For that reason , he said , the Fire Department could say it was " 100 per cent ready even if New York is blitzed tonight . " Raymond Daniell , chief correspondent of THE NEW YORK TIMES in London , who has gone through more than 700 all-out bombing attacks , said he was inclined to be skeptical of risking the lives of children in the streets in the belief they had twenty minutes to get home safely . In London , he recalled , they often got their first warning as bombs began to fall from Nazi planes that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut off . " I hope that if there is any likelihood of bombs falling in the street before the children can get home , that they will be kept in school , where they will be much safer than they will be marching through the streets , " he asserted . Parents Agree This evoked applause from the audience , indicating that many parents agreed with him that it was incongruous to send children into the streets when others were being ordered into shelter . " If the streets are not safe for adults they are not safe for children , either , " Mr. Daniell added . He said the largest number of deaths from air bombing in London occurred in the first week , when many persons ran into the streets and looked up at the sky , as some did here last week . Generally speaking , he ? said , steel and concrete buildings made very good shelters . Arthur Hays Sulzberger , publisher of THE NEW YORK TIMES , welcomed the audience , and said it was the first to use Times Hall , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities but was dedicated yesterday to the American war effort , especially in civilian defense . " We 're up against a grim problem and we 've got to take it on our toes and very firmly on our feet , " he said . " It helps to smile , to be ready to hold our tongues , not to repeat foolish gossip , to be sane and intelligent , and above all to be calm . " Mrs. Anne O'Hare McCormick of THE NEW YORK TIMES editorial board , who presided , said it was expected that the parents ' representatives would carry what they heard back to their own neighborhoods and schools . She said the women of this country had a greater stake in victory than the women of any other country , because of the great influence exerted by women upon the economic , social and moral order in the United States and because the Nazi revolution was an even greater threat to women than to men . As one who had observed the Hitler movement on the spot , she warned : " I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Daniel P. Mahony , president of the United Parents Association of New York City ; A. M. Bush , chairman of the defense committee of that association , and Mrs. John C. Bennett , president of the Staten Island Federation of Mothers Clubs , sat on the speakers ' platform as guests of honor . Hanson W. Baldwin , military and naval expert of THE NEW YORK TIMES , will preside at today 's meeting , when Newbold Morris , president of the City Council , is expected to represent Mayor La Guardia.
