In the California desert 175 miles east of Los Angeles row upon row of darkly tanned U.S. tank soldiers sprawled and squatted , Indian style , in the dry dust . A battery of klieg lights lit up the overcast , night . One soldier climbed a telephone pole and perched there all evening . <P> The men were there to hear mop-maned Leopold Stokowski and the Los Angeles Philharmonic play Shostakovich 's new Seventh ( Leningrad ) Symphony ( TIME , July 20 ) . Black-tailed musicians filed out in the jerry-built unpainted shell . When a shapely blonde violinist took her place in the rear row , the fun began . " Bring her up front , " yelled the soldiers . <P> Then the chant changed to : " We want Stokowski ! " The dapper conductor tripped across the stage . Shouted the tank corps : " He needs a haircut . " <P> Unruffled , Stokowski leaped to the podium , introduced the guest of honor , Mme. Ivy Litvinoff , wife of Russia 's roly-poly Ambassador . The soldiers were asked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of the men had never heard the words . <P> Still unruffled , Stokowski got down to the main business of the evening , Shostakovich 's 80-minute masterwork . Discreetly Conductor Stokowski had cut the symphony 's tortuous length by nearly half , but as he boomed and rattled into the home stretch of the first movement the audience shuffled and groaned impatiently , electricians began jabbering over their microphones , newsreel men noisily ground their cameras . Suddenly Stokowski stopped the orchestra . Said he : " Men , there is a little more of this symphony to play . I do not know whether you want to hear it and it does not matter to us , but I notice that there is some talking over there ( nodding right ) and those over here ( nodding toward Mme. Litvinoff ) who want to listen , ca n't hear . Do you want us to play the rest of it or not ? " <P> Loyally the khaki-clad audience roared : " Yes ! " Unwisely Conductor Stokowski asked : " How many say no ? " Following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No ! " <P> " You can go home , " Stokowski shouted at the rugged individualist . The tank corps listened politely to the rest of the program .
