The U.S. press found little exciting in the espionage trial of Russian Lieut . Nikolai Redin . Most papers carried a casual paragraph or two each day of the trial . But one reporter at the press table in Seattle filed a thumping 1,500 to 2,500 words a night to New York , and got no squawks from his employer . He was greying , 41-year-old William E. Dodd Jr. , son of the late U.S. Ambassador to Germany . His employer : Tass , short for Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union . <P> No Russian paper out of the 8,639 dailies and weeklies served by the Tass monopoly was likely to use much of Dodd 's voluminous copy . But his between-jobs assignment as a Tass stringer in Seattle last week ( he was about to become Harry Bridges ' publicity man ) was typical of the way the world 's least-known big news agency operates . It feeds vastly more wordage ( an estimated 200,000 words a day ) into its six-floor Moscow nerve center than Russian editors ever see . <P> " Truth " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Tass news from the U.S. , was relayed through its bureau in Manhattan 's Rockefeller Center . Except for four Washington correspondents , headed by earnest , well-liked Larry Todd , its U.S. staff of 18 reporters is based in New York . ( The Russians limit each U.S. news organization in Moscow to one or two correspondents . ) Only five of Tass 's 18 U.S. men are Russians . <P> The agency 's U.S. boss is black-haired Vladimir Pravdin ( translation : " Man of Truth " ) , veteran Tassman now vacationing in the U.S.S.R. with his family . Acting director for the summer is slim handsome , secretive Alexander Alexandrov 32 who has spent three of his nine Tass years in the U.S. , says he is not a Party member . <P> No. 2 man is small , twinkly Harry Freeman , a 40-year-old native New Yorker who has broken in a brace of imported bosses since joining Tass in 1929 He speaks little Russian , cables his stories in English . Tass sends 7,000 to 8,000 words a day about the U.S. to Moscow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature news , heavy on production figures , U.S. culture , high-level politics , anything critical of the Kremlin . <P> News by Air . Tass 's ancestral predecessor was the Czarist Russian Telegraph Agency , which worked hand-in-glove with the tight world news cartel promoted by England 's Julius Reuter . In early Bolshevik days it was revived as Rosta ; Tass , born in 1925 , took over Rosta ten years later . <P> The job of rebuilding the agency fell in 1921 to a dynamic , Polish-born Old Bolshevik named Jacob Doletsky . Doletsky worked out news-exchange deals with A.P Boss Kent Cooper and U.P . President Karl Bickel . ( A.P . and U.P . give Tass their own U.S. news reports in return for Tass coverage of Russia . ) <P> In 1937 Doletsky and his head staffers were suddenly purged as " Trotskyist bandits . " Since June 1943 the " Chief Responsible Leader " of Tass has been one Nikolai Palgunov.
