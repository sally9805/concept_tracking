So self - sufficient is General MacArthur 's army that the silencing of Singapore , Batavia and last week of Bandung , princi pal rebroadcasting points for radio to the Far East , made little difference in the amount and quality of programs received on Bataan . Last week , indeed , U.S. contact with the Philippines was peculiarly intimate - even including parts of the islands held by the Japanese . <P> Communications between General MacArthur 's headquarters and the War Department in Washington are naturally through military channels , which the War Department naturally keeps subterranean . But the forces on Bataan are far from being dependent on such bulletins . <P> <P> When MacArthur withdrew to Bataan he took with him enough of Manila 's dismantled station KZRH to make , on reassembly , a 1,000-watt medium-wave transmitter . Bataan thus became a fairly powerful rebroadcast point for short-wave programs from the U.S. The Japanese confiscated all the Filipino short-wave receivers they could find ; but to have confiscated other radios would have interfered with their own propaganda purposes . That suited Competitor MacArthur . <P> From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now picks up and rebroadcasts some two hours of English programs every day . The stuff begins to come in on Bataan at 5 every afternoon ( 2 a.m. in San Francisco ) . It starts with a quarter-hour of straight news . Another quarter-hour is devoted to a roundup of editorial comments from the U.S. Since Bing Crosby 's request performance ( TIME , Feb. 9 ) , KGEI has added a daily half-hour of entertainment from fresh recordings : Monday , Jack Benny ; Tuesday , Cavalcade of America ; Wednesday , Bob Hope ; Thursday , Eddie Cantor ; Friday , Rudy Vallee . There is also news in Tagalog , and a discussion in English , Freedom for the Philippines . The Philippines listen . <P> Last week a special MARCH OF TIME program dramatizing the Bataan fighting was recorded Friday night and sent out to the real dramatis personae on Saturday . On Saturday , too , Cleveland 's station WGAR did itself proud with the most notable program by an inland station yet short-waved to the Philippines . Dedicated to General MacArthur and his men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composer Zoltan Kodaly , to celebrate the 250th anniversary of Budapest 's emancipation from Turkey . The program - by the Cleveland Orchestra - was short-waved " live " from Cleveland 's Severance Hall , reached Bataan at churchtime Sunday morning . Said Conductor Artur Rodzinski , introducing it : " To you , our salute and our prayers . " Said Commentator Kay Halle : " In such moments a hymn of praise and thanksgiving can say more than any words . . . . "
