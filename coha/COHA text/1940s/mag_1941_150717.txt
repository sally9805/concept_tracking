Brewster Aeronautical Corp . ( Newark , N.J. ) needed mechanics who could crawl inside flying-boat wings , hold rivets in place while workmen outside hammered away with rivet guns . Brewster 's skinniest workers found the chore a squeezing torture , could stand it for only a few minutes at a time . Along came 19-year-old Johnny Giovenco ( " Johnny Gee " for short ) , a Brooklyn mechanic who usually had a hard time getting a job because he was only four feet high , weighed 88 Ib . He quickly got an inside job with Brewster . After New York newspapers printed his picture , little men swarmed to the Brewster plant . Last week three more were hired .
