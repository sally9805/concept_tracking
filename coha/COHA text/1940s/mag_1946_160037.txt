At quiet Swarthmore College one night last week , 0 . ( for Oet je ) John Rogge , special assistant to the U.S. Attorney General and prosecutor of the hapless 1944 Washington sedition trials , raked over a few coals concerning Nazi wartime intrigue in U.S. politics . <P> Rogge traced out the oft-told tale of the late oilman William R. Davis , who , inspired by the German Government , had tried to mediate World War II back in 1940 . He also mentioned John L. Lewis , Senator Burton K. Wheeler and other touchy names in the same breath with Nazi bigwigs . <P> To the familiar Davis story Rogge added the authority of months spent in Germany this year , poring over Nazi records . Upon his return Rogge had turned over a report to Attorney General Tom Clark with the expectation that it would be published . Instead , Clark had kept it in the files . <P> After Rogge 's Swarthmore speech Pennsylvania Republicans gleefully recalled that pro-German Bill Davis once had connections with another prominent politico : Senator Joe Guffey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rogge with willfully violating Justice Department rules by making a speech based on the quashed report . Then he fired him . <P> To Be Gods of the Lightning <P> Week after week Harry Truman has pondered one of the most important decisions he had to make : the appointments to the godlike Atomic Energy Commission - the five men who will control the entire field of research , production , engineering and application of atomic power in the U.S. ( TIME , April 22 ) . This week the President named them . One is a proved New Dealer , three are Republicans-but politics apparently played no part in the selection . All have previously performed public service : <P> David Eli Lilienthal , who will be chairman , is a six-foot , sharp-faced lawyer , Harvard protege of Felix Frankfurter , longtime antagonist of the utility monopolists , who after serving in the Wisconsin <P> Public Service Commission in 1933 became the guiding spirit and director of TVA . He was chairman of the committee which prepared the Lilienthal-Acheson plan for international atomic control. * <P> Robert Fox Bacher ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research at Cornell University , one of the scientists who assembled the first atomic bomb . Cool , deliberate , diplomatic , Bacher is regarded by his colleagues as one of the country 's half-dozen leading nuclear physicists . <P> William Wesley Waymack , 58-year-old editor and vice president of the Des Moines Register and Tribune , member of the Board of Directors of the Chicago <P> Federal Reserve Bank , vigorous , well-traveled , winner of several Pulitzer awards for his editorials , a Republican who traveled on the Willkie train . <P> Lewis Lichtenstein Strauss , 50 , close friend of Judge Samuel Rosenman , who rose to the rank of rear admiral in the naval reserve ; is now on the Navy 's Civilian Research Advisory Committee ; a partner in Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. , bankers ; a Jewish philanthropist ; a Republican .
