A PLAN FOR PENSIONS SUBSTANTIAL FEDERAL PENSIONS seem a political certainty in the near future . In fact , after 10 years without any progress in social security , the line forming behind **26;1442;TOOLONG is growing so fast that the danger now may be that , finally moved to action , we shall act unwisely . Business , seeking to shift the burden of industrial pensions from employers to government ; politicians , sensing the rising clamor for security in old age ; and organized old people , sick of living on charity , will all be converging on Congress next year . The dramatic achievement of the unions in winning $100-a-month old-age guarantees from the steel , auto and mining industries has excited such a general desire for similar security that it is no longer a question whether we shall have adequate pensions , but what kind they shall be . A small proportion of American industries have moved to relieve the mounting pressure through private pension plans of various kinds . These plans blossomed in greatest numbers during the war years when the excess-profits tax made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 20 cents on the dollar , the government footing the rest of the bill . In the ' last seven years , private pension arrangements multiplied about seven times , but still only 13,000. of the 490,000 United States corporations have such plans in operation today . ? The pressure has not by any means been entirely relieved . The percentage of our population over 65 rose from three percent in 185() to seven percent in 1940 , and is expected to reach 10 percent by 1970 . The meager benefits this group was drawing from the social-security program in 1938 have not begun to keep pace with inflation ; while the cost of living is up about 70 percent since 1940 , federal old-age-insurance benefits have increased only $2.60 per month , to an average of $25.60 , leaving buying power cut about 35 percent . Payments to these aged citizens are averaging only 73 cents per day at the present time . Even those old people not eligible for insurance from payroll levies have fared better . Old-age assistance grants , paid only to the poverty-stricken , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $43.60 , which means a 40-percent increase in real purchasing power and gives these charity cases a better break than those who have left their jobs in industry because of old age . This year only 1,600,000 of the 11 million Americans over 65 will receive old-age-insurance benefits from the federal government . To be eligible , a man or woman must have had six full years of work in " cov -- ered " employment , and not more than three out of five civilian jobs are in the " covered " class . In addition , no payment is made in any month when the pensioner earns more than $14.99 by his own labor . The maximum benefit for a man retiring at the end of this year who has earned $3,000 or more every year since the Social Security Act has been in operation will be $44.80 per month . Actual payments now are greatly below this , since few workers have earned $250 a month regularly since 1937 . The system established by the Social Security Act of 1935 consisted of contributory insurance based on the level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the states for charity cases . This latter program is entirely local , except for minimum standards set by the federal government . These state programs vary widely , the number receiving assistance last year ranging from 79 percent of all Louisianans over 65 to less than five percent of the aged in the District of Columbia . But the charity benefits under the grant-in-aid system have proved so much more adjustable to the cost of living that , contrary to the intention of the original Act , the old-age-assistance program has become the major element . While the rest of the world has been moving forward with social security along insurance lines , the United States has tended to go back to the charity principle . The resentment of our " senior citizens " over this fact is natural and their efforts to force the elimination of the charity concept are fully justified . As our retired senior citizens have fallen behind the economic parade , they have become a prime target for local demagogues . Aspiring swindlers and budding politicians alike have studied the political lessons learned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are whipping up the oldsters when aging spirits lag . Most of this activity is for flat pensions , regardless of previous rate of earnings . The pressure is strongest in agricultural states where old people have been convinced that they have no stake in the present social-security system . In California , Florida , Louisiana , Oklahoma and Washington , in particular , the old folks are a powerful political force today . When the last session of Congress adjourned , the Townsend Plan bill was only 39 signatures short of the 218 required to bring it to the floor . Senator Taft has declared that immediately on reconvening , the Senate must study the pension question seriously . " If a steelworker and a miner are to receive POO a month after 65 why not a molder or a waiter ? " Senator Taft asks . Why not , indeed ? The question is how best to advance to at least that stage as rapidly as possible . Continuation of the present trend to disproportionate benefits for industrial workers in our largest corporations is certainly not the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than labor could win for itself independently in the concentrated industries , labor will be better off in the long run to work for a national retirement system that will equally protect the farmers , the independent workers and those who are already out of the productive class . A flat government pension system which disregards previous levels of earnings is not the way either . To substitute such a plan for the present insurance system would be to make security a permanent political football . The unions have made a fine contribution in the recent , fights for industrial pensions , insisting on talking about income as lifetime earnings . Having progressed from hourly to weekly to annual wage goals , - the unions are taking the logical next step in aiming now for security of lifetime earning power . That is the context in which pensions should be considered . Basically , the way to high pensions is through high earnings . For the best results , in terms of a full-employment economy , pensions should be related more closely to productivity than to any other criteria . Pending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the House in the first session of this Congress , follow these principles and when adopted will improve considerably the present wretched state of affairs . Even with the extensions provided for in HR 6000 , however , the vast majority of needy aged would not receive pension insurance as their right and would still have to rely on charity from the assistance program . We believe it is now practical to insist on a far more sweeping plan . We suggest that : The present social-security system be extended to cover all employed persons , including farmers and independent workers earning $400 or more a year , and all those who have reached the age of 65. 2 . All men at age 65 and all women at age 60 be made eligible for a minimum retirement benefit of $40 a month . Those who have earned wages in " covered " employment in the past would receive , in addition , 15 percent of their average monthly wage in the highest live years , up to a maximum of $400 , plus one percent for each year in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would receive these benefits whether they are working or not ; those under 70 would receive no benefits if they are earning more than $74 a month . 4 . Reductions to be made in the benefits of those who have not been more or less continuously employed ? earning wages in roughly three-fourths of the years between the passage of the new law and the age of retirement . 5 . Benefits to be tied to the cost of living to protect those dependent on them against depreciation of their dollars . A subsidiary benefit or bonus to be paid whenever the index of consumer prices increases more than a stated percent , perhaps five points in the scale . ( When prices decline , the bonuses would be stopped. ) 6 . All permanently and totally disabled persons should receive the same amounts under ' the same general conditions applying to those over 65. 7 . The employer , the employee and the government would share in the cost . The employer and employee should contribute equally to the retirement fund on the first $4,800 of compensation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the point where they would cover the cost of the plan . Government contribution , financed by general taxation , should make up the deficit for those now under the program who will contribute to it over less than a lifetime and those already of retirement age . Government contribution , if brought in only when needed , probably would not be required for 10 to 15 years . It is practically impossible , therefore , to measure the dollar cost at that time , since it will depend largely on the size of the national product we shall have attained by then , on the tendency to remain employed of the perhaps 18 million old people we shall have at that time , and the pattern of wages . Eventually , the most intrepid statisticians venture , the government 's share would amount to about one-half of the yearly cost of the program . These proposals would mean immediate benefits to all retired persons of from $50 for a single individual to $149.75 for a man and his wife . In five years , the DECEMBER 19 , 1949 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aged couple , $180.90 . After 30 years , these benefits would reach $143 for a single man , and $193 for a couple , in the average $3,000 salary range . This is no inexpensive undertaking . Using simple multiplication , Senator Taft estimated that $100 pensions for all over 65 would cost the government $12 billion a year . Some of his assumptions with regard to cost are no doubt wrong , but his guess is probably in the general neighborhood of the sum that would be involved . Assuming that our gross national product will rise by 75 to 100 percent above the present figure in the next 25 years , this would not be too heavy an obligation to assume . Even were economists to determine that the cost of a full-scale retirement plan was beyond our means at the moment , however , the matter could not be dropped there . The old people now left outside our social-insurance system will continue their pressure for retirement rights , not charity , until they receive them . As the gap in comparative security for their families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will keep on mounting . The American government is going to have to assume responsibility for security in old age . We can proceed to do so in a way that is geared to ' assuring full employment by increasing our consumption and production annually ? or we can wait until an unworkable scheme is thrust upon us.
