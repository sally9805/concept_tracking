Said a sputtering BBC announcer : " It makes me furious-absolutely furious ! " At Nottingham , England , in the famed Test Matches ( Britain v. Australia ) , an Australian cricketer was sending down " bumpers " ( a beanball type of bowling that bounced up into the batsman 's face ) . Every time he bowled , the audience cut loose with the British equivalent of Brooklynese . Even the tea-sippers in the pavilion joined in the vulgar booing . What was cricket coming to ? <P> After the match , the embarrassed chairman of the Nottinghamshire Club apologized to Don Bradman , Australia 's cricketing Babe Ruth , for the crowd 's behavior . Bradman could afford to be gracious . His bully boys , with the help of bumpers , were leading England ( which had n't had its second innings yet ) by 478 runs . <P> Winners elsewhere last week : <P> At Wimbledon , wearing a new crew haircut ( he once used ribbons to tie up his blond thatch ) , Sweden 's Lennart Bergelin , 23 , tore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the year . Down went Parker , in five sets . But Bergelin 's new look was n't enough to get him by hard-hitting Bob Falkenburg in the quarterfinals . The Swede fell before Falkenburg 's big serve , 6-4 , 6-2 , 3-6 , 6-4 . <P> At Kalamazoo , Southern California became king of collegiate baseball by edging out Yale , two games to one . Yale also reached the finals last year only to lose out to California . <P> At Bloomfield , N.J. , fully recovered from the mumps , dogged Gil Dodds ran the fastest mile of the outdoor season ( 4:08.8 ) on a water-logged track . His long-range objective : outfooting half a dozen Swedes , all of whom could do 4:04 or better , in the Olympic games .
