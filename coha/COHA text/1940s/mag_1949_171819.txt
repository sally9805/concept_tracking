The U.S. 's cool attitude toward the military junta now ruling Venezuela was sharply stressed last week when squat , bull-necked Jos Rafael Pocaterra , the junta 's special envoy to the U.S. , handed his credentials to Secretary of State Dean Acheson . For speed , the diplomatic niceties set something of a record : two minutes . As Pocaterra recalled it , the correct but icy interview went like this : <P> Pocaterra ( shaking hands ) : I have the honor , Mr. Secretary , to present to you my credentials as Ambassador of Venezuela on official mission . ( Hands papers to Acheson . ) <P> Acheson : Thank you very much . <P> Pocaterra : Mr. Secretary , it certainly is nice to have such a sunny day after yesterday 's snow and sleet , is n't it ? <P> Acheson : Yes , it certainly is . <P> Pocaterra ( rising ) : Well , Mr. Secretary , I do not want to take up any more of your time . It is a great pleasure to meet you . <P> Acheson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ambassador . Goodbye .
