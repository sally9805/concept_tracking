For the first time in its 116 years Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute , oldest engineering college in the U.S. , has opened its doors to women . <P> Many other collegiate overtures are being made to women-especially from engineering schools , which hope to train them to replace draftees . But the girls are not enrolling . Hoboken 's Stevens Institute of Technology reported that the women 's division of its War Industries Training School was only a third full . Women , it seemed , wanted to start either at the bottom or the top of war industry , refused to train for anything in between . <P> When New York City engineering colleges opened a joint school , offering to train 150 women as draftsmen , inspectors and designers in a free 30-week course , hey netted only 25 women for the course . The school soon learned that most women preferred overalls . Snorted Dean Albert B. Newman of City College : " They all want to take a two-week course in welding , with high pay right away .
