txt All recent events in event-filled Ind event-thrilled Greece are overshadowed by the Communist threat to set up a revolutionary creek government  --  theoretically Ln the Greek mountains but presumably in Yugoslavia . This plan was openly outlined at the international Communist " Congress " just held in Strasbourg . France . A number of subsequent developments indicate that this is not a mere Communist gesture but part of the current basic strategy of world Communism , directed from Moscow . Public opinion here , all elements in the Government , and even the most moderate circles , such as the anti-government Liberal Party , have been deeply impressed by this apparent plan to convert Greece into a second Spain . New Government ' Threat What brought this long-latent danger to the fore was an announcement by Greek Communist leader Miltiades Porphyrogenis to the world Communist leaders that Greek Communist-led guerrillas soon would set up their own government . The Greek Communist spokes : - man added that the Greek Communist Party demanded from the Communists of France and other countries " full and concrete support " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is considered increased by the fact that the Secretary of the Greek Communist Party , Nicholas Zachariades , was present at Strasbourg when it was made . A Greek Communist act hardly could be made more official than this ap= peal to world Communists " to enter into secret negotiationp regarding military aid for the guerrillas . " No Room in Greece ' Concerning the Communist threat , Foreign Minister Constantine Tsaldaris said , as broadcast over the Athens Radio , " Tliere is no room in Greece for a ** government . Therefore , Zachiriades can materialize the intentions he disclosed only on foreign Vice-Premier Solhocles Venizelos said , " the Communist intention has always been to form a government , . . . but it will never materialize ! " Minister of Public Works Stylianos Gonatas said , " The Communists failed in the past and they will fail now when they control much less territory . " Minister of the Interior George Papandreou said , " Communist plans are now revealed , but their realization is impossible . " Stern Action Planned Minister of Public Order Napoleon Zervas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek Government will tackle it in a most drastic manner . " War Minister Stratos , said , " The rebels are in permanent control of no part of Greece and are being mercilessly pursued even in the most inaccessible gorges . " The veteran Liberal leader , Themistocles Sophoulis called the Communist announcement " almost the last straw that will break the camel 's back , a fateful step bringing Greece much nearer disaster . " He added , " The transformation of Greece into a second Spain where foreign armies would lay the country waste would increase the Communists ' unpopularity among moderate citizens . " Though western diplomatic circles here profess greater calm and say that under present conditions such a government could not be formed on-Greek territory , all diplomatic and political ob servers , whether home or foreign , agree in private that this development is very significant . Actually the Communist announcement radically changes the Greek picture . For the first time , the Greek Communist Party openly identifies itself with the mountain rebels . As the Liberal newspaper Vima writes , " The rebellion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire Greek party . " Until now the Communists had restricted themselves in their public statements to moral support for the guerrillas . Wedge for Russia ? It generally is believed here that if American-Russian antagonism continues , the Greek Communists will carry out their threat to establish a " free " government . Some sources suggest their intention may be to have such a " government split into two teams , one of which would reside in foreign Balkan territory and the other would be attached to the guerilla chief , ' General Markos ' He would have to keep moving his headquarters and when hard pressed could jump into Yugoslavia or Bulgaria . " Such a government , it is pointed out , " could be recognized by Russia and its satellites , " which thereby would establish a basis for open help to the Greek Communists . Viewed as No Bluff Some observers here have pointed out that on the very day Mr. Porphyrogenis made his announcement in France , a Bulgarian spokesman told the United Nations Security Council that Bulgaria was obliged to offer asylum to ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army is fully organized and commands substantial lines of communications as well as territory . " The Communist threat is not looked upon as a bluff here . The Communists , it is thought , will proceed with their plan because a civil war has its ruthless logic and because the Greek Communist Party is being used as the " suicide squad " of world Communism . The significance of the fact that the Greek Communist appeal was given much space in the American Communist Daily Worker is not overlooked here . As the American Communist organ wrote that " Greece stands in the vanguard of the world-wide people 's struggle , " it seems plain that the Communist appeal for " ten times more aid " to Greece in its " world struggle " is being circulated among the Communists of all lands . Thus , the present outlook is extremely grave . The moderate elements have been placed in an impossible quandary . The policy of moderation remains Greece 's last hope ; yet events favor and justify , at least today , those asking for drastic measures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
