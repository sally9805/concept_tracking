txt The three-Power - discussions taking place in London on raising the level of German industry are critical  --  not as they affect the future of Germany but as they determine whether France , Britain and the United States can agree on a policy . This is the key to the future of Western Europe , and therefore to the future of the Continent as a whole . For two things become clearer every day. , One is that if the countries of the West can be strengthened to save their independence in a new framework of conscious interdependence , in the long run the Soviet satellite states will gravitate into the Western orbit . The other is that the prospects of the Marshall Plan ? which is essentially an inquiry into the terms on which the United States will cooperate with Western Europe ? depend on agreement on how to use the resources of Germany . These resources are now stagnant . It is idle either to fear , as the French do , or to hope , as some Americans are supposed to do , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point where German production reaches anything like the pre-war level . For one thing , the present division , while it is unlikely to last forever , is pretty certain to last a long time . If Russia defies outside opinion and contemptuously overrides the resistance of the peasant parties in predominantly peasantjands to subdue the Balkan states , she will certainly balk at nothing to hold on to the far more importiant territory she controls in Eastern Germany . A Germany which has lost a third of her former territory and a great proportion of her manpower can not possibly function as she did before . And while the imports and exports of this truncated Germany are under the absolute control of the three Powers now in conference , as they will be for an indefinite period , her economy can be kept within the bounds they set and directed in the way they decide . It could be directed toward war only if the three Governments abandoned their responsibility , their reason and the cardinal interest that holds them together . Total Occupation The fact is tkat the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do what they like with Western Germany . There is no central government ; the German administrations of the states within each zone are completely subject to the military governments . The occupation of the country is of a kind without precedent after previous wars ; it attempts to change not only the political system but the economy , the education and the mentality of the country . The people depend on their conquerors for their bread ration . They can not get a ton of raw material without permission . The Ruhr , the great forge of Europe , is in the hands of military government . The Saar , second biggest coal deposit in Western Germany , has already been incorporated in the French economic orbit . A large part of the present output , not only of coal but of manufactured goods , is earmarked for reparations . Russia still holds a valid mortgage on a sizable share of the existing industrial plant . Under these conditions , the three governments have an unequaled opportunity to direct the German economy as they will . All that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Europe is agreement among the Allies  --  and in this case of the Western Allies only , for they have rejected Moscow 's protest that a three-Power conference on the level of industry violates the Potsdam pact , and are determined to go ahead with the attempt to integrate Germany into the Marshall Plan . How far can they agree ? The British have apparently given up their policy of nationalizing the Ruhr mines and yielded to the American view that the decision on this point should be postponed for the emergency , or until the Germans are in position to have a voice in the matter . This concession , however , has caused a bitter reaction in labor circles in England . Desperate Europe The French are said to be ready to make concessions also , in this case to a view shared by the British and Americans . In exchange for a greater allocation of Ruhr coal to France , they are willing to consent to a limited rise in the German level of industry . This , too , is an unwilling concession , made with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar domination . " The states of mind in both countries- are understandable , and should be understood by Americans as human reactions to pressures beyond our experience . But they do not change inescapable realities . They only emphasize the desperateness-of the state of Europe . The situation has gone far beyond France 's old dread of Germany or her natural desire , which everybody shares , to see the French steel industry built up at the expense of the German . It has gone beyond bolstering up Britain with a new loan . The truth is that there is not enough production , or even productive power , to set Europe on its feet unless the Ruhr is used for this purpose . Perhaps there is not enough even then . But it has to be used , and quickly ; it has to be used , under due controls , as part of the whole European economy . There is no question , and . should not be , of using it for Germany alone . The only hope of recovery is in agreement , and surely there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of this asset in the general scheme of cooperative reconstruction envisaged in the Marshal/ proposal . If not , the prospects of European salvation are dark , indeed .
