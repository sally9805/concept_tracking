A Federal sales tax is in the works . The entire body of New Deal thinking , which long opposed sales taxes as a burden on the poor , has switched completely . In the U.S. war economy , with its new rich and its new poor , only a tax on the low-income groups can provide new revenue for arms production and drain away the real bulk of inflationary purchasing power . Putting a $25,000 ceiling on incomes would leave both problems untouched . <P> In the Administration , only President Roosevelt and Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau still held out last week against the sales tax ; and in his seven-point anti-inflation program , even the President talked of sales taxes or of compulsory savings that would also hit the new rich . <P> One economist 's estimate is that the farmer and labor groups , whose 1939 income was about $45,000,000,000. will be earning at the rate of $80,000,000,000 by this year 's end . Out of this $35,000,000,000 increase , the present Federal taxes and all the proposed tax increases would catch only some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax bill on the $80,000,000,000 would be only $5,000,000,000 . Meanwhile there is not much blood left in the rest of the turnip : business and businessmen who will be earning $35,000,000,000 by year 's end ( up only $5,000,000,000 or so over 1939 ) , will pay $20,000,000,000 - 60% - to the Government . <P> Said Pundit Walter Lippmann : ' ' About half of all consumption goods . . . are bought . . . by the great mass of people who have small incomes . . . . Until there is a tax bill which reaches the lower incomes , which have recently been in the aggregate greatly increased , and until there is a compulsory savings plan , the Administration ought not to pretend that it is dealing with inflation . . . . " <P> Said Columnist Raymond Clapper : " The classic popular argument against the sales tax is that it bears more heavily upon the poor than on the rich . That is its effect without the slightest doubt . . . . But now we get at the rich through the income tax . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . The other half of the job is to get at the expanding buying power now going into the lower-income groups . . . . The only practical way left to get at this money is through sales taxes and compulsory savings . Five years ago that was a reactionary program . Now it is a New Deal necessity . " The public agreed : this week a Gallup poll showed 54% ready for a 2% sales tax , 46% for 3% , 43% for 5%.
