In their western-front offensive , the Germans used new weapons . One was a leviathan tank , the 75-ton Knigstiger ( Royal Tiger ) , whose turret could turn through the full circle , whose hitting power was a greatly elongated version of the high-velocity 88-mm. gun . In one model the monster 's frontal armor was six-inch steel plate , slanted at high angle to bounce shells off . But in another version the Knigstiger was reportedly a true land battleship-its turret faced with twelve inches of armor , probably impenetrable to all but the heaviest field-artillery projectiles . <P> Out-Armored . The Royal Tiger was comparatively slow ( 18 to 20 miles an hour ) , but nimble at turning to fight . Its tracks were 2 ft. 8 in. wide , to give it sure footing on sloppy ground . <P> Another effective enemy weapon : a 45-ton modernized tank-destroyer . It carried the same 88-mm. high-velocity gun as the Royal Tiger , but in a heavily armored boxlike compartment . <P> Against the German weapons were some new U.S. guns and tank-destroyer types still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still the medium Sherman tank , carrying either a 75-mm. gun ( outclassed by the 88-mm. ) or 105-mm. howitzer . The Allies have nothing of comparable size to the Knigstiger , consider such monsters too road-bound to be of great value . <P> Bearing the brunt of U.S. antitank defense were two reliables : 1 ) the M36 ( Slugger ) with a high-velocity 90-mm. gun ; 2 ) the fast , low-slung M18 ( Hellcat ) and its 76-mm. pieces . But the best antitank weapon of all is the rocket-firing fighter-bomber-weather permitting . <P> Weather did not halt the German ersatz air force of pilotless V-bombs , and by last week Allied commanders were willing to concede that the V-bombs had true military value when coupled with an offensive . The Germans fired salvos of V15 and V-25 , and a shorter-ranged , smaller version of V-2 as they would have used heavy artillery in advance of an assault . Their effectiveness was obvious : even haphazard strikes could do military damage aplenty in junction towns crowded with men and materials .
