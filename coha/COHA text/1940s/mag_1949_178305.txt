In the July issue of Coronet ( circ. 2,650,000 ) , readers got a beguiling glimpse of Cat Island-a South Pacific " paradise you may have for the asking , " complete with palm trees and coral beaches . There was only one catch , reported Author Lucille Beckhart ; the island was inhabited and ruled by hordes of ferocious cats . <P> According to Author Beckhart , Cat Island , which she located as " near Tahiti , " had first been invaded by rats from a sinking ship . To get rid of them , a French traveler imported hundreds of cats . When the cats in turn multiplied and grew vicious , the natives were forced to desert the island . <P> Fascinated by the Coronet account , Reporter William Kennedy of the Los Angeles Herald &; Express tried to find Cat Island on a map , but could n't ; he asked Coronet and was referred to the governor of Tahiti . To Los Angeles Mirror Columnist Fred Beck , who promptly told his readers all about it , Kennedy and two friends confided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with poison gas to kill the cats , then build a comfortable hotel for tired newsmen ( The Cat House ) and start a profitable local industry ( catgut ) . <P> But Kennedy wiped away the grin when a Pasadena millionaire made a serious offer to underwrite a vacation trip to Cat Island in his 136-ft. schooner . Last week , as the expedition got ready to sail , a disillusioning cable arrived from Tahiti 's governor : THERE IS NO SUCH ISLAND . <P> The story , which catnapping Coronet had printed as fact , was fiction . Where did Mrs. Beckhart , a fortyish California X-ray therapist and housewife who writes freelance articles " as a hobby , " get the yarn ? Said she last week : " A friend of mine , a very well-traveled person , told me about it . Unfortunately , he has since died . . . "
