txt The big budget fight of 1947 is taking a new turn . This is the first major issue on which President Truman is pitted against the Republican majority of the 80th Congress . Mr. Truman says he needs .. to spend $37,500 , - 000,000 to carry on the Government . The G. 0 . P. knows it can not give its promised 20 per cent tax cut at that figure and is all set to slash expenditures . And now , for the first time , Congress has a new budgetary weapon to help in its fight . Today , representatives of four major congressional fiscal committees met together to chart their plans . Setting Precedent Oddly enough , not since the United States started as a nation have the congressmen who fix taxes and the congressmen who decide on expenditures met as an integrated group . No private family could carry on its budget " as Congress has been doing all these years , the money-raising committees . proCeeding more or less independently of the money-spending committee . It was the bright idea of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be easier to balance budgets if the two groups got together in advance . It helps even a government , they argued , to know how much there is in a pocketbook before spending it . There are four committees involved : the Appropriation Committees of House and Senate ( spending ) and the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committees ( taxing ) . Together , these committees have 102 members . So , to save trouble at the start five members from each of the four are meeting , Senators and Representatives . Republicans and Democrats alike , to see what to do about Mr. Truman 's big budget , and the even bigger postwar debt of the nation . Fourth of Trillion The American debt today has 12 figures ; it . is over a quarter of a trillion dollars . The figure is $260,000.000,000 . That means that every family of four has a share of about $7.000 . Mr. Truman 's proposed big budget for next year undoubtedly was a shock to Congress . For that same average American family of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or about nine times the good old prewar days , 1929 to 1941 when the amount averaged $127 a family . It is also four times the highest spending ? rate of the New Deal before the war started . Mr. Truman 's figures were a polite fiscal gauntlet thrown down to the Republican Congress . Congress is picking up the gauntlet . But it must be reported that the mood has changed somewhat since the optimistic preelection forecasts of only $29,000 , - 000,000 in expenditures , or the recommendation of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of a 525.000.000,000 target . If Congress can shave four billions , or even three billions , off the Truman figures a good many hopes will be satisfied . Want Tax Cuts , But ... A bipartisan group of tax-conscious senators talked things over with Lewis Douglas , former Budget Director , this week end . They included Senators Harry F. Byrd ( D ) of Virginia , Walter F. George ( D ) of Georgia , Robert A. Taft ( R ) of Ohio , and others . No decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that business recession would cut federal income materially on one hand , and increase certain expenditures on the other , like the cost of bolstering farm subsidies . Individual congressmen have come to the conclusion that everybody in the United States wants tax cuts . The campaign slogan to cut income taxes " 20 per cent " was highly popular . On the other hand , it appears that many of the very same persons who want tax cuts deplore any reduction in favorite Federal expenditures . The United States Conference of Mayors , for example , now holding its 15th annual session , warns against any curtailment in Federal aid programs relating to highway construction , airport construction , hospital construction , farm and vocational education , and all the other types of a id . Blocs Start Action Advocates or strong national defense are organizing to resist efforts to whittle down the Truman $11,200,000,000 Army-Navy item . The so-called armed services " merger " is not going to cut expenses , at least at first , it is be-lieved , House members who are veterans have organized into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will be hard to reduce expenditures for veterans , amounting to about 25 per cent of the Truman budget , or $7,300 , - 000,000 , with such support behind it . And so it goes . The difficulty of the problem explains why the House Ways and Means Committee unanimously voted to retain excise luxury taxes after Mr. Truman recommended it . Congress is expected to approve their retention shortly . and this should bolster Federal revenue by some $1,100,000,000 . Truman Challenge To summarize the matter , Mr. Truman has definitely , though politely , challenged the Republican-controlled Congress on the key fiscal problem of the nation . The Republicans , in turn , are preparing to scrutinize every item of his proposed budget with as much care , probably , as ever has been given a similar document . In their operation they are benefitted by a brand new device , the integration of taxing and spending committees so the United States for the first time will have both sides of the ledger considered in advance by Congress . Within 60 days of receiving the Truman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiscal proposal , the first " legislative budget " in history , with a tentative ceiling on expenditures . To help in determining what would be appropriate for the /at-ter . Senator Styles Bridges ( H ) of New Hampshire , Chairman of t he Appropriations Committ-e , has called in the Brookings Insti-. tution . He has asked it to make a factual survey " of rock-bottom budget needs to guide the legislature .
