MISSISSIPPI Indestructible Man <P> Theodore Gilmore ( " The Man " ) Bilbo of Mississippi , a chunky fighting cock who campaigns in a red necktie tastefully embellished with a diamond horseshoe stickpin , is probably the most indestructible man in U. S. politics . For one thing , he has been in jail ( in 1923 , for refusing to testify at the trial for seduction of his hand-picked successor as Governor ) . In 1932 , when he finished his second gubernatorial term , which had been enlivened by an episode in the Governor 's office involving a blonde and a pistol shot , he and Mississippi were both practically bankrupt . Shelved in Washington by kindly fellow Democrats with a $6,000-a-year job clipping newspapers , The Man two years later bounced into the U. S. Senate . <P> This year , when The Man 's turn came to run for renomination. he was swimming up to his big ears in more political hot water than usual . He had raised the hackles of his stooped , shambling , shrewd colleague , Pat Harrison , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conner against Harrison for the Senate in 1936 , and of Mike Conner , by helping to beat him for the Governorship last year . Worse , his fat , bespectacled ex-wife Linda publicly denounced him for cruelty and infidelity . Opposed by popular onetime Governor Hugh Lawson White for the <P> Democratic Senatorial nomination ( i.e. , election ) , embattled Theodore Bilbo returned from Washington a fortnight ago to face his many enemies . For two weeks , he tramped the State in his red necktie and howled . When the votes were counted last week . Theodore Gilmore Bilbo , still indestructible at 62 , was headed back to Washington for six more years .
