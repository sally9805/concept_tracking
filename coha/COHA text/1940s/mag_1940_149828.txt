Eve and Delton Conly both loved adventure . They were married last year and sailed out of Oakland , Calif. for a cruise to Hawaii and on around the world in a converted lifeboat . That trip ended just outside of Golden Gate when Eve , who was pregnant , became ill . Ashore , they moped around until their round-eyed daughter , Patsy , was six months old . Last summer the Conlys began making new plans . <P> They had met another sea-struck couple , Chester and Fern Thompson of San Pedro . Thompson had done some deep-sea diving . Why did n't they all sail to the Marquesas Islands , 3,000 miles southwest in the Pacific , and dive for pearls ? The Conlys were enthusiastic . <P> In August , the 28-foot lifeboat , sloop-rigged , christened the Wing On , was loaded to the gunwales with diving gear , radio receiving set , bedding , food supplies . The Conlys left Patsy with Delton 's sister . The Thompsons left a two-year-old daughter and infant son with grandparents . <P> Away they sailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went by . No ship on the Pacific reported sighting the Wing On . Her whereabouts was the sea 's secret . <P> Last week , radio and cable on the Fiji Islands , 2,500 miles south and west of their destination , the Marquesas , began spelling out high adventure 's ending . According to the messages , a Seventh-Day Adventist missionary , skirting the jungly , palm-lined shore of Vanua Levu Island in his ketch , had sighted a small , battered craft impaled on a coral reef . On board , to his horror , he found an emaciated woman prostrate and unconscious , another woman and a man both dead . On the stern of the boat was her name : Wing On . <P> The dead were Eve and Delton Conly . The still-living woman was Fern Thompson . The Wing On 's fragmentary log told the rest . After noting that the yacht had run into a " cyclone , " the entry dated Nov. 7 read : " Discovered Chet had died . What next ? Help us , oh God ! " On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 8:10 a.m. ; died starvation ... he was too far gone at any rate to stand any of the remaining can of apricots we had . " The last entry , on Nov. 12 , was merely : " D. A. Conly , master , yacht Wing On . " <P> Delton Conly , according to Fiji officials , had apparently died soon after he had scrawled his signature . Eve had died just a day or two before the sea washed the Wing On up on Vanua Levu . The rest of the story of the 100-day adventure was locked behind the swollen lips of Fern Thompson , who , in critical condition , was carried delirious to an island hospital .
