Oh my time past , whin I put me jut through wry livin ' wan of the Tin Commandments between Revelly and Lights Out , blew the froth off a pewter , wiped me mustache wid the back av me hand , an ' slept on ut all as quiet as a little child ! <P> Thus Kipling 's Private Terence Mulvaney , a professional fighting man to the tip of his mustaches , but a private after years in the Queen 's service ( " I was rejuced aftherwards , but , no matther , I was a Corp'ril wanst " ) . Last week the U.S. Army announced , in effect , that no Mulvaneys were wanted . After their three-year enlistment , regular privates will not be allowed to re-enlist unless they are worthy of promotion to higher grade ( i.e. , noncommissioned rank ) or have specialists ' ratings . <P> " With Selective Service now the law of the land , " said the Army , " quantity of personnel is no longer an Army problem but ... the quality of the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance .
