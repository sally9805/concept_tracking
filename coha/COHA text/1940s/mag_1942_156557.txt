Big Bill Jeffers tackled the chaotic Rubber Scandal this week in the hellbent , direct-action way he has run the Union Pacific Railroad . <P> Damn it , men , things are in a hell of a fix and a tough job 's got to be done , he said in substance after Franklin Roosevelt and Donald Nelson named him tsar to produce and conserve rubber . The actual words are the ones the hardboiled , red-faced , Irish Bill Jeffers spoke one day in January 1922 to trainmen clustered around a red-hot , pot-bellied stove in the Hanna , Wyo. depot . <P> A sub-zero gale was driving needle-sharp snow over Elk Mountain against the tiny station , piling drifts over the main line to Parco . Traffic had stopped . Outside , almost buried , were a giant mallet locomotive and a mountain snowplow . U.P . General Manager William Martin Jeffers was telling the men he knew the job was dangerous but it had to be done . Not one to give an order he could not fill , Jeffers climbed into the cab . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battled foot by foot . Every curve meant the danger of an avalanche . Every few minutes the motors stalled ; everybody had to get out to shovel . A snow boulder stove in the cabside . The engineer was knocked out . Bill Jeffers jumped to his place , grabbed the throttle , finally got the plow into Parco . Union Pacific trains ran again . <P> Said Bill Jeffers , jumping into his rubber job last week : " What we need is action and we need it quickly . And we are going to get just that . I think that the American people are more confused about what to do than unwilling to do what is right . . . . I have all the authority I need . I am perfectly willing to assume all the responsibility to see that this work is done . " <P> " I 'd Rather Be President . . . . " Bulky Bill Jeffers ( 5 ft. 11 in. , 220 lb. ) knows nothing about rubber but knows a lot about railroading , his only interest for 53 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William J. Jeffers , was earning $55 a month in the Union Pacific shops in North Platte , Neb. when Bill ( one of nine children ) was born . Bill finished a year of high school and went to work as a U.P . call boy at $5 a week ( for seven days ' work at up to twelve hours a day ) . " I ca n't remember when I was a boy , " he said once . " It seems to me I 've always been a man . But miss anything ? No ! " <P> Always he used to say , " I 'd rather be president of the Union Pacific than president of the United States . " A hard man but fair , he got to the top by loyalty and frequent fights with those who opposed him and by having no interests except the Union Pacific ( " The Railroad " to him ) . He reached the goal in 1937 , succeeding the late great Carl Raymond Gray . <P> Three years before , when Jeffers was executive vice president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trains ; when he became president passengers were waiting 48 hours to get reservations on the road 's air-conditioned all-coach Challenger-one of his creations-whose passengers got 25-to-35 meals , free pillows and drinking cups , separate coaches for women and children , free cookies . He boasts he can call 10,000 U.P . trainmen by their first names ; the older ones call him Bill .
