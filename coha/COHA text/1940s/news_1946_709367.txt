Letters to The Times France Held Peace Factor But Full Cooperation Is Regarded as Dependent on Frontier Security To THE EDITOR OF THE NE-7 YORK TIMES : With your columns full of the story of the grave crisis which is a serious threat to the effectiveness of the newly born U. N. , it may not seem to be the moment to attempt to direct attention to other pressing world problems . But apart from political considerations , a prostrate Europe needs the simplest economic aid in the form of food and essential raw materials . The urgency of this is particulaily striking to one who has just returned from abroad and has had an opportunity of seeing at first hand some of the conditions to which you have attempted to direct the attention of our fellow-countrymen . While I recently visited other countries , most of my time was spent en France . There a very brave effort is being made to get the economic wheels turning again . That country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would probably be the protests of those who were schooled in the thought of America First , some aid must be given to our former ally . Materials must be furnished which they cannot. themselves produce to permit them to fashion their own recovery . This question can be readily left to the , good sense of the American people . However , they must be thoroughly awakened to the pressing nature of the obligation . Frontier Settlement Essential Hand in hand with this economic problem is the political and incidental military one . France can hardly even effectively use our economic aid to put her house in order until the matter of the western frontiers of Germany has been resolved . It is no answer to this very burning question to say that France has not always been cooperative with her allies in the government of Germany . General de Gaulle has very properly pointed out that there can be no full cooperation on the part of France in that government until the security of her eastern frontier is assured . A people whose country has been twice ravaged within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rebuilding , even if materials were available and they had sufficient food to give them an interest in work , until a settlement of this common boundary between them and Germany with its related problems insures them for all time against the threat of a renewed invasion . It is not enough to draw a geographical line between these two peoples . But also and at the earliest moment the very vital question of the disposition of the Ruhr and the Saar must be intelligently resolved . It is rumored that the matter of reparations causes England to object to the French demand that these two areas , or at least the Ruhr , be internationalized . The great war potential these areas have for Germany makes it imperative that the redevelopment of industry in this area should be closely controlled by some allied body and that its industry should not be again unrestrictedly given back to German management . Internationalization Favored Internationalization seems to be one answer to the problem . If there are real objections to it , it would seem that it is our duty to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary means to permanently devote the numerous productive possibilities of that area to the purposes and benefits of peace . Our State Department , of course , has its problems with the U. N. at the moment , but , nevertheless , no time should be lost in immediately applying reason and common sense to the question of the Franco-German frontier . Its resolution , equally with the granting of a loan or credits , would con ' tribute greatly to putting a weary France on the road to recovery . If France is to be the beachhead of democracy in Western Europe and have the strength to play that role , it is high time , ten months after the fighting on that front has ceased , that the frontier question should be intelligently resolved . RICHARD J. CRONAN . New York , March 30 , 1946 . One Revelation Expounded To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In your editorial of March 24 you referred to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse , using the commonly accepted interpretation that these were sinister figures representing conquest , slaughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embedded in popular usage that you are perhaps justified in accepting them . The Hollywood picture , " The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse , " has made this usage almost universal . Permit me , however , to question it as regards the rider of the white horse . These horsemen appear in the second of the seven distinct visions which make up the main part of the Book of the Revelation . When the rider on the white horse appears in this vision , there is not a line to indicate that he is a sinister figure , as in the case of the three other horsemen . The late Dr. Moulton of Chicago University , in his " Modern Reader 's Bible , " points out a curious relationship between these seven visions . Thus the first and the seventh , the second and the sixth , the third and the fifth follow pretty much the same pattern , and in each case the later vision is the denouement of the earlier vision . When , therefore , you turn over to the corresponding sixth vision , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he is distinctly described . " His name Is called the Word of God . " This time the sinister figures do not appear . The rider on the white horse is now backed by a glorious , company of knights on white horses clothed in fine linen , white and clean . Their leader does symbolize conquest , but it is spiritual conquest and spiritual victory . Some of us are trying to believe that the rider on the white horse is leading on , and that he is conquering and is to conquer even though the rider on the red horse carries an atomic bomb in his hand . CHARLES F. WISHART , President Emeritus , College of Wooster . Wooster . Ohio . March 30. 1946 . Hawaii Case Parallel Seen Relocation of Nisei Here as War Move Regarded as Analogous To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In Ex parte Duncan , the Supreme Cieurt has declared the wartime exercise of martial law in Hawaii illegal , at least as to individuals arrested long after the Pearl Harbor emergency . The decision has properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand among the leading cases of the law as a fundamental assurance of protection for the individual in his relation to the state . The reasoning and spirit of the opinions of the Justices reinforce the institutions of American liberty . The case raises , however , one disturbing issue for public action . Ex parte Duncan is in every way inconsistent with the hasty wartime decisions of the court upholding the " relocation " of American citizens of Japanese descent who were on military order removed from the West Coast in 1942 and denied their liberty for more than three years . It was surprising that the present Supreme Court , generally so willing to correct its own mistakes , missed the opportunity to undo its decisions in the cases of the Japanese-Americans , and especially Korematsu v. United States . The opinions in Ex parte Duncan contain only fleeting and obscure references to the Japanese-American cases . For everyone but a dsteemined splitter of legal hairs , however , the status of these cases is not in doubt . They have been repudiated . If it was illegal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawaii in 1942 and 1944 , it was even more illegal on the West Coast to send 100,000 men , women and children into three years of confinement without so much as a military trial . Public opinion and the Congress must accept the premise that the Supreme Court has now held our relocation program illegal . Our society therefore owes reparation to those who were relocated . They should be allowed to present claims for war damage like other innocent victims of the war program . Until the wrong is acknowledged and made right we shall have failed to meet the highest responsibility of a democratic society  --  the obligation of equal justice . EUGENE V. ROSTOW . New Haven , Conn. , April 1 , 1946 . Suggested to the OPA To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK Truss : Shopping for essentials is so satisfying these days ! The housewife greatly in need of a new whisk-broom can buy , a paris-green , brittle wispy one for merely 75 cents . There was a time , not too long ago , when the push-cart peddler on the East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Why you only have to pay e8 or e9 for a pair that are fetchingly short , seductively thin , and made of the same type of cheesecloth Woolworth 's used to sell five yards for a quarter ! Hardware ? Have you ever seen such beautifully gleaming junk ? Yes , I did , long ago , - when Japan seemed to have a monopoly on such items . They were bright , quite pretty and usually came apart before you got them home . But at least they were priced as cheaply as they were worth . Perhaps the OPA would be more successful if it tackled its problems from a different angle and set itself up as an Ouster of Punk Articles . It could lift the price controls on all the inferior stock that is now crawling out of the storehouses and smack new controls right back on again at reductions of from 50 to 100 per cent . Then it would be less profitable for the manufacturers to hold on to these commodities . They would dump them quickly and would have to start manufacturing new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MARIAN Dour .
