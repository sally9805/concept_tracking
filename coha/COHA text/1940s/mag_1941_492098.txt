THE SJITURPR Y EVENING POST An American Institution " They know what it is to have a hand so shaky a towel must be used in this fashion to get a glass to the mouth . T HREE men sat around the bed of an alcoholic patient in the psychopathic ward of Philadelphia General Hospital one afternoon a few weeks ago . The man in the bed , who was a complete stranger to them , had the drawn and slightly stupid look that inebriates get while being defogged after a bender . The only thing that was noteworthy about the callers , except for the obvious contrast between their well-groomed appearances and that of the patient , was the fact that each had been through the defogging process many times himself . They were members of Alcoholics Anonymous , a band of ex-problem drinkers who make an avocation of helping other alcoholics to beat the liquor habit . The man in the bed was a mechanic . His visitors had been educated at Princeton , Yale and Pennsylvania and were , by occupation , a salesman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year before , one had been in shackles in the same ward . One of his companions had been what is known among alco holies as a sanitarium commuter . He had moved from place to place , bedeviling the staffs of the country 's leading institutions for the treatment of alcoholics . The other had spent twenty years of life , all outside institution walls , making life miserable for himself , his family and his employers , as well as sundry well-meaning relatives who had had the temerity to intervene . The air of the ward was thick with the aroma of paraldehyde , an unpleasant cocktail smelling like a mixture of alcohol and ether which hospitals sometimes use to taper off the paralyzed drinker and soothe his squirming nerves . The visitors seemed oblivious of this and of the depressing atmosphere that clings to even the nicest of psychopathic wards . They smoked and talked with the patient for twenty minutes or so , then left their personal cards and departed . If the man in the bed felt that he would like to see one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in a telephone call . 9 They made it plain that if he actually wanted to stop drinking , they would leave their work or get up in the middle of the night to hurry to where he was . If he did not choose to call , that would be the end of it . The members of Alcoholics Anonymous do not pursue or coddle a malingering prospect and they know the strange tricks of the alcoholic as a reformed swindler kmows the art of bamboozling . Herein lies much of the unique strength of a movement which , in the past six years , has brought recovery to around 2000 men and women , a large percentage of whom had been considered medically hopeless . Doctors and clergymen , working separately or together , have always managed to salvage a few cases . In isolated instances , drinkers have found their own methods of quitting . But the inroads into alcoholism have been negligible and it remains one of the great unsolved public-health enigmas . By nature touchy and suspicious . the alcoholic likes to he left alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convenient way of ignoring the tragedy which he inflicts meanwhile upon those who are close to him . He holds desperately to a conviction that , although he has not been able to handle alcohol in the past , he will ultimately succeed in becoming a controlled drinker . One of medicine 's queerest animals , he is , as often as not , an acutely intelligent person . He fences with professional men and relatives who attempt to aid him and he gets a perverse satisfaction out of tripping them up in argument . There is no specious excuse for drinking which the trouble shooters of Alcoholics Anonymous have not heard or used themselves . When one of their prospects hands them a rationalization for getting soused , they match it with half a dozen out of their own experiences . This upsets him a little and he gets defensive . He looks at their neat clothing and smoothly shaved faces and charges them with being goody-goodies who do n't know what it is to struggle with drink . They reply by relating their own stories-the double Scotches and brandies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drinking bout : the awakening from a spree without being able to account for the actions of several days and the haunting fear that possibly they had run down someone with their automobiles . They tell of the eight-ounce bottles of gin hidden behind pictures and in caches from cellar to attic ; of spending whole days in motion-picture houses to stave off the temptat ion to drink ; of sneaking out of the office for quickies during the day . They talk of losing jobs and stealing money from their wives ' purses ; of putting pepper into whisky to give it a tang ; of tippling on hitters and sedative tablets , or on mouthwash or hair tonic ; of getting into the habit of camping outside the neighborhood tavern ten minutes before opening lime . They describe a hand so jittery that it could not lift a pony to the lips without spilling the contents ; of drinking liquor from a beer stein because it can he steadied with two hands , although at the risk of chipping a front tool h ; of tying an end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the hack of the neck and drawing the free end with the other hand , pulley fashion , to advance the glass to the mouth ; of hands so shaky they feel as if they were about to snap off and fly into space ; of sitting on hands for hours to keep them from doing this . These and other bits of drinking lore usually manage to convince the alcoholic that he is talking to blood brothers . A ' , ridge of confidence is thereby erected , spanning a gap which has baffled the physician , the minister , the priest or the hapless relatives . Over this connection , the trouble shouters convey , bit by hit , the details of a program for living which has worked for them and which , they feel , can work for any other alcoholic . They concede as out of their orbit only those who are psychotic or who are already suffering from the physical impairment known as wet brain . At the same time they see to it that the prospect gets whatever medical attention is needed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest Alcoholics Anonymous to t heir drinking patients . In some towns the courts and proltation officers co-operate with the local group . In a few city psychopathic divisions the workers of Alcoholics Anonymous are accorded the same visiting privileges as staff members . Philadelphia General is one itf these . Dr. John F. Stouffer , the chief psychiatrist , says : " The alcoholics we get here are mostly those who can not afford private treatment , and this is by far the greatest thing we have ever been able to offer them . Even among those who occasionally land hack in here again we observe a profound change in personality . You would hardly recognize them . " The Illinois Medical Journal , in an editorial last December , went farther than Doctor Stouffer , in stating : " It is indeed a miracle when a person who for years has been more or less constantly under the influence of alcohol and in whom his friends have lust all confidence , will sit up all night with a ' drunk ' and at stated intervals administer a small amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking a drop himself . " This is a reference to a common aspect of the Arabian Nights ' adventures to which Alcoholics Anonymous workers dedicate themselves . Often it involves sitting upon , as well as up with , the intoxicated person , as the impulse to jump out a window seems to be an attractive one to many alcoholics when in their cups . Only an alcoholic can squat on another alcoholic 's chest for hours with the proper combination of discipline and sympathy . During a recent trip around the East and Middle West I met and talked with scores of A. A. 's , as they call themselves , and found them to be unusually calm , tolerant people . Somehow they seemed better integrated than the average group of nonalcoholic individuals . Their transformation from cop fighters , canned-heat drinkers and , in some instances , wife beaters , was startling . On one of the most influential newspapers in the country I found that the city editor , the assistant city editor and a nationally known reporter were A. A. 's , and strong in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard a judge parole a drunken driver to an A. A. member . The latter , during his drinking days , had smashed several cars and had had his own operator 's license suspended . The judge knew him and was glad to trust him . A brilliant executive of an advertising firm disclosed that two years ago he had been panhandling and sleeping in a doorway under an elevated structure . He had a favorite doorway , which he shared with other vagrants , and every few weeks he goes back and pays them a visit just to assure himself he is n't dreaming . 11 high . Statistics on traditional medical and religious cures are lacking , but it has been informally estimated that they are no more than 2 or 3 per cent effective on run-of-the-mine cases . Although it is too early to state that Alcoholics Anonymous is the definitive answer to alcoholism , its brief record is impressive and it is receiving hopeful support . John D. Rockefeller , Jr. , helped defray the expense of getting it started and has gone out of his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a small one , in deference to the insistence of the originators that the movement be kept on a voluntary , non paid basis . There are no salaried organizers , no dues , no officers and no central control . Locally , the rents of assembly halls are met by passing the hat at meetings . In small communities no collections are taken , as the gatherings are held in private homes . A small office in downtown New York acts merely as a clearinghouse for information . There is no name on the door and mail is received anonymously through Box 0 ; 58 , Church Street Annex post office . The only income , which is money received from the Yale of a honk describing the work , is handled by The Alcoholic Foundation , a board composed of three alcoholics and four non-alcoholics . In Akron , as in other manufacturing centers , the groups include a heavy element of manual workers . In the Cleveland Athletic Club I had luncheon with five lawyers , an accountant , an engineer , three salesmen , an insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager , a manager of an independent store and a manufacturer 's representative . They were members of a central committee which coordinates the work of nine neighborhood groups . Cleveland , with more than 450 members , is the biggest of the A. A. centers . The next largest are located in Chicago , Akron , Philadelphia , Los Angeles , Washington and New York . All told , there are groups in about fifty cities and towns . Self-insurance Rgainst Demon Runs TN DISCUSSING their work , the A. A. 's spoke of 1 their drunk-rescuing as " insurance " for themselves . Experience within the group has shown , t hey said , that once a recovered drinker slows up in this work he is likely to go hack to drinking , himself . There is , they agreed , no such thing as an ex-alcoholic , If one is an alcoholic  --  that is , a person who is unable to drink normally ? one remains an alcoholic until he dies , just as a diabetic remains a diabetic . The best he can hope for is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulin . At least , the A. A. 's say so , and medical opinion tends to support them . All but a few said that they had lost all desire for alcohol . Most serve liquor in their homes when friends drop in and they still go to bars with companions who drink . The A. A. 's tipple on soft drinks and coffee , One , a sales manager , acts as bartender at his company 's annual jamboree in Atlantic City and spends his nights tucking the celebrators into their beds . Only a few of those who recover fail to lose the feeling that at any minute they may thoughtlessly take one drink and skyrocket off on a disastrous hinge . An A. A. who is a clerk in an Eastern city has n't had a snifter in three and a half years , but says that he still has to walk fast past saloons to circumvent the old impulse ; but he is an exception . The only hang-over from the wild days that plagues the A. A. is a recurrent nightmare . In the dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frantically trying to concearhis condition from the community . Even this symptom disappears shortly , in most cases . Surprisingly , the rate of employment among these people , who formerly drank themselves out of job after job , is said to be around 90 per cent . One-hundred-per-cent effectiveness with non-psychotic drinkers who. sincerely want to quit is claimed by the workers of Alcoholics Anonymous . The program will not work , they add , with those who only " want to want to quit , " or who want to quit because they are afraid of losing their families or their jobs . The effective desire , they state , must be based upon enlightened self-interest ; the applicant must want to get away from liquor to head of incarceration or premature death . He must be fed up with the stark social loneliness which engulfs the uncontrolled drinker and he must want to put some order into his bungled life . As it is impossible to disqualify all border-line applicants , the working percentage of recovery falls below the 100-per-cent mark . According to A. A. estimation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost immediately ; 25 per cent get well after suffering a relapse or two , and the rest remain doubtful . This rate of success is exceptionally In Chicago twenty-five doctors work hand in hand with Alcoholics Anonymous , contributing their services and referring their own alcoholic patients to the group , which now numbers around 200 . The same co-operation exists in Cleveland and to a lesser degree in other centers . A physician , Dr. W. D. Silkworth , of New York City , gave the movement its first encouragement . However , many doctors remain skeptical . Dr. Foster Kennedy , an eminent New York neurologist , probably had these in mind when he stated at a meeting a year ago : " The aim of those concerned in this effort against alcoholism is high , their success has been considerable and I believe medical men of good will should aid . " The active help of two medical men of good will , Drs . A. Wiese Hammer and C. Dudley Saul , hay assisted greatly in making the Philadelphia unit one of the more effective of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Continued on Page 89 ) 89 mark of ever having been folded . Will you explain that ? " The witness looked stunned . " I can explain it . This bid was never that box . Is n't that so ? " it Judge Rowan said , " Show me that paper . . . Well , Mr. Director ? What have you to say ? " He returned the bid to John . " What do you suppose happened ? " " Well , we know one thing  --  this bid was never in that box . Yet McGurk and Company did have one there . My theory is that the director misread the true bid after noting what the others had bid . But this was dangerous ; someone might ask to see it , which , in fact , happened . To obviate this , McGurk and Company supplied him with several bids , spaced five or ten thousand dollars apart  --  and in round figures , easier to remember  --  which he brought in his folder . It was one of these bids  --  the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which he showed Mr. Latham . The fraud was simplified by the new ordinance of council permitting fiat sums to be posted instead of the former five per cent . Upon destruction of the other McGurk bids , discovery seemed impossible . But whoever thought of the scheme forgot one thing  --  folding that paper to make it look as though it came from that box . " " Your honor ! This is just slander ! Nothing but theory ! " " You can never explain why that bid shows no fold . . . . Continue , Mr. Doowinkle . " " Well , the conspiracy with regard to the bid implies a conspiracy with rebeginning in an offhand way in February , 1940 , when a businessman who was an A. A. convert was transferred to Philadelphia from New York . Fearful of backsliding for lack of rescue work , the newcomer rounded up three local bar flies and started to work on them . He got them dry and the quartet began ferreting out other cases . By last December fifteenth , ninety-nine alcoholics had joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  thirtynine from one to three months , seventeen from three to six months , and twenty-five from six to ten months . Five who had joined the unit after having belonged in other cities had been nondrinkers from one to three years . At the other end of the time scale , Akron , which cradled the movement , holds the intramural record for sustained abstinence . According to a recent check-up , two members have been riding the A. A. wagon for five and a half years , one for five years , three for four and a half years , one for the same period with one skid , three for three ? and a half years , seven for three years , three for three years with one skid each , one for two and a half years and thirteen for two years . Previously , most of the Akronites and Philadelphians had been unable to stay away from liquor for longer than a few weeks .

In the summer of 1939 the group began working on the alcoholics confined in Rockland State Hospital , at Orangeburg , a vast mental gard to the cement . Each was consideration for the other . What the division of spoils was we can not say , but we can be sure of this  --  Jennings was simply a straw party . It sums up to this : The defendant was aware of the fraud on Porter and knew all along that his title to the cement was invalid . That , your honor , constitutes his criminal intent . " The jurist nodded . " And will hold him for court . You will also see that Feeney applies for a parole . I 'm afraid I was hasty in that case . But all this is minor . You will furnish a transcript of this case to the City Solicitor , and you will take steps to prosecute all parties ? including the missing Jennings ? for conspiracy . Please come up here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought it was some publicity stunt . Now I see you were sending a little man after a big one . " He smiled broadly . " Get out of my sight before I cite you for misuse of process ! " Latham said indignantly , " Brennan knew such a registered letter would never reach Porter . When I think of their learning of the poor man 's condition and taking advantage of it I suppose they did n't think he 'd survive . And then lying to him so he could n't protect himself . But you scalped them ! Where 's Officer Stuart ? We 'd like to meet him . " " Here he is . . . . Officer , I was telling these men how I ruined your vacation " Stuart stopped him , grinning . " Lieutenant , if you please . The commissioner was at the hearing . Ruined my vacation ? I 'll take any number like that .

Blaisdell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walls and meetings were held in the recreation hall . New York A. A. 's went to Orangeburg to give talks and on Sunday evenings the patients were brought in state-owned busses to a clubhouse which the Manhattan group rents on the West Side . Last July first , eleven months later , records kept at the hospital showed that of fifty-four patients released to Alcoholics Anonymous , seventeen had had no relapse and fourteen others had had only one . Of the rest , nine had gone back to drinking in their home communities , twelve had returned to the hospital and two had not been traced . Doctor Blaisdell has written favorably about the work to the State Department of Mental Hygiene and he praised it officially in his last annual report . Even better results were obtained in two public institutions in New Jersey , Greystone Park and Overbrook , which attract patients of better economic and social background than Rockland , because of their nearness to prosperous suburban villages . Of seven patients released from the Greystone Park institution in two years , five have abstained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. A. records . Eight of ten released from Overbrook have abstained for about the same length of time . The others have had from one to several relapses . Why some people become alcoholics is a question on which authorities disagree . Few think that anyone is " born an alcoholic . " One may be born , they say , with it hereditary predisposition to alcoholism , just as one may be born with a vulnerability to tuberculosis . The rest seems to depend upon environment and experience , although one theory has it that some people are allergic to alcohol , as hay-fever sufferers are to pollens . Only one note is found to be common to all alcoholics emotional immaturity . Closely related to this is an observation that an unusually large number of alcoholics start out in lift- as an only child , as a youngest child , as the only boy in a family of girls or the only girl in a family of boys . Many have records of childhood precocity and were a hat are known as spoiled children . Frequently the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parent , is unduly cruel , the other overindulgent . Any combination of these factors , plus a divorce or two . tends to produce neurotic children who are poorly equipped emotionally to face the ordinary realities of adult life . In seeking escapes , one may immerse himself in his ' IasiTle &S,; Nvorking twelve to fifteen hours a day , or in spurts or in some artistic side line . Another tin &; what he thinks is a pleasant escape in drink . It bolsters his opinion of himself and temporarily wipes away any feeling of social inferiority which he may have . Light drinking leads to heavy drinking . Friends and family are alienated and employers become disgusted . The drinker smolders with resentment and wallows in self-pity . He indulges in childish rationalizations to justify his drinking  --  he has been working hard and he deserves to relax , his throat hurts from an old tonsillectomy and a drink would ease the pain , he has a headache , his wife does not understand him , his nerves are jumpy , everybody is against him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excuse maker for himself . All the time he is drinking he tells himself , and those who lout into his affairs , that he can really become controlled drinker if he wants to . To demonstrate his strength of will , he goes for weeks without taking a drop . He makes a point of calling at his favorite bar at a certain time each day and ostentatiously sipping milk or a carbonated beverage , not realizing that he is indulging in juvenile exhibitionism . Falsely encouraged , lie shifts to a routine of one beer a day , and t hat is the beginning of the end once more . Beer leads inevitably to more beer and then to hard liquor . Hard liquor leads to another first-rate bender . Oddly , the trigger which sets off the explosion is as apt to be a stroke of business success as it is to be a run of had luck . An alcoholic can stand neither prosperity nor adversity . Curing by Catharsis The victim is puzzled on coming out of the alcoholic fog . Without his being aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a while , he no longer needs his rationalizations to justify the fatal first drink . All he knows is that he feels swamped by uneasiness or elation , and before he realizes what is happening he is standing at a bar with an empty whisky pony in front of him and a stimulating sensation in his throat . By some peculiar quirk of his mind , he has been able to draw a curtain over the memory of the intense pain and remorse caused by preceding stem-winders . After many experiences of this kind , the alcoholic begins to realize that he does not understand himself ; he wonders whether his power of will , though strong in other fields , is n't defenseless against alcohol . He may go on trying to defeat his obsession and wind up in a sanitarium . He may give up the fight as hopeless and try to kill himself . Or he may seek outside help . If he applies to Alcoholics Anonymous , he is first brought around to admit that alcohol has him whipped and t hat his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humility , he is given a dose of religion in its broadest sense . He is asked to believe in a Power that is greater than himself , or at least to keep an open mind on that subject while he goes on with the rest of the program . Any concept of the higher Power is acceptable . A skeptic or agnostic may choose to think of his Inner Self , the miracle of growth , a tree , roan 's wonderment at the physical universe , the structure of the atom or mere mathematical infinity . Whatever form is visualized , the neophyte is taught that he must rely upon it and , in his own way , to pray to the Power for strength . He next makes a sort of moral inventory of himself with the private aid of another person  --  one of his A. A. sponsors , a priest , a minister , a psychiatrist , or anyone else he fancies . If it gives him any relief , he may get up at a meeting and recite his misdeeds , but he is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have stolen while intoxicated and arranges to pay off old debts and to make good on rubber checks ; he makes amends to persona he has abused and , in general , cleans up his past as well as he is able to . It is not uncommon for his sponsors to lend him money to help out in the early stages . This catharsis is regarded as important because of the compulsion which a feeling of guilt exerts in the alcoholic obsession . As nothing tends to push an alcoholic toward the bottle more than personal resentments , the pupil also makes out a list of his grudges and resolves not to be stirred by them . At this point he is ready to start vorking on other active alcoholics . By the process of extroversion , which the work entails , he is enabled to think less of his own troubles . The more drinkers he succeeds in swinging into Alcoholics Anonymous , the greater his responsibility to the group becomes . He ca n't get drunk now without injuring the people who have proved themselves his best friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quit being a leaner . If raised in an orthodox church he usually , but not always , becomes a regular communicant again . Simultaneously with the making over of t he alcoholic goes the process of adjusting his family to his new way of living . The wife or husband of an alcoholic , and the children , too , frequently become neurotics from being exposed to drinking excesses over a period of years . Re-education of the family is an essential part of a follow-up program which has been devised . Alcoholics Anonymous , which is a synthesis of old ideas rather than a new discovery , owes its existence to the collaboration of a New York stockbroker and an Akron physician . Both alcoholics , they met for the first time a little less than six years ago . In thirty-five years of periodic drinking , Doctor Armstrong , to give the physician a fictitious name , had drunk himself out of most of his practice . Armstrong had tried everything , including the Oxford Group , and had shown no improvement . On Mother 's Day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lugging an expensive potted plant , which he placed in his wife 's lap , Then he went upstairs and passed out . ' At that moment , nervously pacing the lobby of an Akron hotel , was the broker from New York , whom we shall arbitrarily call Griffith . Griffith was in a jam . In an attempt to obtain control of a company and rebuild his financial fences , he had come out to Akron and engaged in a fight for proxies . He had lost the fight . His hotel bill was unpaid . He was almost flat broke . Griffith wanted a drink . During his career in Wall Street , Griffith had turned some sizable deals and had prospered , but , through ill-timed drinking bouts , had lost out on his main chances . Five months before coming to Akron he had gone on the water wagon , through the ministrations of the Oxford Group in New York . Fascinated by the problem of alcoholism , he had many times gone back as a visitor to a Central Park West detoxicating hospital , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inmates , He effected no recoveries , but found that by working on other alcoholics he could stave off his own craving . Doctor for a Patient A stranger in Akron , Griffith knew no alcoholics with whom he could wrestle . A church directory , which hung in the lobby opposite the bar , gave him an idea . He telephoned one of the clergymen listed and through him got in touch with a member of the local Oxford Group . This person was a friend of Doctor Armstrong 's and was able to introduce the physician and the broker at dinner . In this manner Doctor Armstrong became Griffith 's first real disciple . He was a shaky one , at first . After a few weeks of abstinence , he went East to a medical convention and came home in a liquid state . Griffith , who had stayed in Akron to iron out some legal tangles arising from the proxy battle , talked him back to sobriety . That was on June 10 , 1935 . The nips the physician took from a bottle proffered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took . Griffith 's lawsuits dragged on , holding him over in Akron for six months . He moved his baggage to the Armstrong home , and together the pair struggled with other alcoholics . Before Griffith went back to New York , two more Akron converts had been I obtained . Meanwhile , both Griffith and Doctor Armstrong had withdrawn from the Oxford Group , because they felt that its aggressive evangelism and some of its other methods were hindrances in working with alcoholics . They put their own technique on a strict take-it-or-leave-it basis and kept it there . Progress was slow . After Griffith had returned East , Doctor Armstrong and his wife , a Wellesley graduate , converted their home into a free refuge for alchoholics and an experimental laboratory for the study of the guests ' behavior . One of the guests , who , un- ' I known to his hosts , was a manic depressive as well as an alcoholic , ran wild one night with a kitchen knife . He was overcome before he had stabbed.fl anyone .

The physician 's new ( Continued an Page 92 ) ( Continued from Page 901 sobriety caused a revival in his practice , but not enough of one to carry the extra expense . The Armstrongs , nevertheless , carried on , on borrowed money . Griffith , who had a Spartan wife , too , turned his Brooklyn home into a duplicate of the Akron manage . Mrs. Griffith , a member of an old Brooklyn family , took a job in a department store and in her spare time played nurse to inebriates . The Griffiths also borrowed , and Griffith managed to make odd bits of money around the brokerage houses . By the spring of 1939 the Armstrongs and the Griffiths had between them cozened about one hundred alcoholics into sobriety . In a book which they published at that time the recovered drinkers described the cure program and related their personal stories . The title was Alcoholics Anonymous . It was adopted as a name for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the book got into circulation , the movement spread rapidly . Today , Doctor Armstrong is still struggling to patch up his practice . The going is hard . He is in debt because of his contributions to the movement and the time he devotes gratis to alcoholics . Being a pivotal man in the group , he is unable to turn down the requests for help which flood his office . Griffith is even deeper in the hole . For the past two years he and his wife have had no home in the ordinary sense of the word . In a manner reminiscent of the primitive Christians they have moved about , finding shelter in the homes of A. A. colleagues and sometimes wearing borrowed clothing . .11 Self-Starting Movement Having got something started . both the prime movers want to retire to the fringe of their movement and spend more time getting back on their feet financially . They feel that the way the thing is set up it is virtually sell-operating and self-multiplying . Because of the absence of figureheads and the fact that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no fear that Alcoholics Anonymous will degenerate into a cult . The self-starting nature of the movement is apparent from letters in the files of the New York office . Many persons have written in saying that they stopped drinking as soon as they read the book , and made their homes meeting places for small local chapters . Even a fairly large unit , in Little Rock . got started in this way . An Akron civil engineer and his wife , in gratitude for his cure four years ago , have been steadily taking alcoholics into their home . Out of thirty-five such wards , thirty-one have recovered . Twenty pilgrims from Cleveland caught the idea in Akron and returned home to start a group of their own . From Cleveland , by various.means , the movement has spread to Chicago , Detroit , St. Louis , Los Angeles , Indianapolis , Atlanta , San Francisco , Evansville and other cities . An alcoholic Cleveland newspaperman with a surgically collapsed lung moved to Houston for his health He got a job on a Houston paper and through a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. unit which now has thirty-five members . One Houston member has moved to Miami and is now laboring to snare some of the more eminent winter-colony lushes . A Cleveland traveling salesman is responsible for starting small units in many different parte of the country . Fewer than half of the A. A. members have ever seen Griffith or Doctor Armstrong . To an outsider who is mystified , as most of us are , by the antics of problem drinking friends , the results which have been achieved are amazing . This is especially true of the more virulent cases , a few of which are herewith sketched under names that are not their own . Sarah Martin was a product of the F. Scott Fitzgerald era . Born of wealthy parents in a Western city , she went to Eastern boarding schools and " finished " in France . After making her debut , she married . Sarah spent her nights drinking and dancing until daylight . She was known as a girl who could carry a lot of liquor . Her husband had a weak stomach and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After her father 's fortune had been erased in 1929 , Sarah got a job in New York and supported herself . In 1932 , seeking adventure , she went to Paris to live and set up a business of her own , which was successful . She continued to drink heavily and stayed drunk longer than usual . After a spree in 1933 she was informed that she had tried to throw herself out a window . During another bout she did jump , or fall  --  she does n't remember which ? out of a first-floor window . She landed face first on the sidewalk and was laid up for six months of hone-setting , dental work and plastic surgery . In 1936 Sarah Martin decided that if she changed her environment by returning to the United States , she would be able to drink normally . This childish faith in geographical change is a classic delusion which all alcoholics get at one time or another . She was drunk all the way home on the boat . New York frightened her and she drank to escape it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the friends cut her , she hung around Third Avenue bars cadging drinks from strangers . Up to this point , she had diagnosed her trouble as a nervous breakdown . Not until she had corn mitted herself to several sanitariums did she realize , through reading , that she was an alcoholic . On advice of a staff doctor , she got in touch with an Alcoholics Anonymous group . Today she has another good job and spends many of her nights sitting on hysterical women drinkers to prevent them from diving out of windows .
