After a year of bench-warming , some of the U.S. 's star architects were finally at work last week on defense housing . In Pittsburgh 's suburb of New Kensington , not far from Aluminum Co. of America 's sprawling plant , builders got started on a set of emergency houses designed by famed Architect Walter Gropius of Harvard and his co-Bauhusler Marcel Breuer . They differed as much from the first crop of Government houses for defense workers as a Frank Lloyd Wright design does from a suburban contractor 's . <P> Gropius and Breuer got the assignment this month , spent 36 hours of uninterrupted frenzy at the drafting board . Their 250 family are uncrowded , fresh in design , improved and begadgeted like many a more expensive house . ( Defense houses may not cost more than an average of $3,500 . ) They are grouped around open lawns , safely separate from streets and highways , and partitioned to privacy by walled-in porches . <P> In the two-storied houses the architects have made the upper walls almost solidly of glass . All have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let in the sun in Janary but exclude it in July . <P> Gropius ' New Kensington project is only the most notable of a flock of new defense houses being built by the country 's best architects . Already complete and occupied are the sombrero-eaved cottages which Los Angeles ' Richard J. Neutra designed for Avion Village , near Dallas . Cranbrook 's Eliel Saarinen is working on designs for 200 defense units in Detroit ; George Howe has an assignment at Middletown , Pa . On the next largest project of all is San Francisco 's able William W. Wurster , who drew up the site plan for 1,692 units for Mare Island ( Calif. ) naval-base workers . Builders got started on Wurster 's houses last month . <P> Many of these big-name projects are frankly experimental . Each architect was encouraged to cut fancy figures with 15 to 25 of his houses , and Washington housers hoped to find some gold-medal ideas among them ; but most of the houses were designed on more conventional lines . Government officials were leary of prefabrication which got little chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . But they have finally realized that speed and low cost are persuasive claims , and from 10 to 20% of defense housing is now prefabricated . <P> In defense housing 's first year , FWA ( in charge of building ) turned over almost all assignments to the Public Building Administration ( PBA ) , which had its own architects ready to hand , left independent architects out in the cold . Cried famed Modern Architect William Lescaze : " Experts are winning this war . Architects are experts . ... At the present moment a great number of architects . . . are made to feel that their usefulness to their country is infinitely smaller than that of an 18-year-old apprentice in a flying school . " <P> PBA 's experts knew more about post offices and customs houses than small dwellings . PBA was slow , clumsy , encrusted with prejudices . In twelve months it built 7,063 of the 32,681 houses assigned it . ( In the same period the Navy , building its own emergency houses , nearly finished a $50 million , 15,352-unit program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carmody finally revamped his housing program , and to the noisy joy of the profession , began calling in private architects for help .
