In a sulphurous meeting in Washington last week , 50 of the nation 's biggest mule dealers cussed in concert as only men who have mingled with mules can cuss . They mentioned , in various uncomplimentary ways , the U.S. Government , the Department of Agriculture and the Mexican Government . But they saved their real whizbangs for a fellow dealer , Kansas City 's Ferd Owen . When they had worked off their wrath , they got Texas ' Representative Wingate Lucas to draft an odd bill for Congress . It would prohibit export of mules except by Government permit . <P> The fire behind this sulphurous cloud was caused by 1 ) a mixup by the Department of Agriculture and 2 ) a smart trick by Dealer Owen . Last May , the Department of Agriculture wired all big dealers that it wanted to buy mules for resale to Mexico . They were needed to replace oxen exterminated in Mexico 's hoof- &-mouth; epizootic . The dealers bought up 8,000 mules , signed contracts to buy 12,000 more . But when they went to Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it might not buy a single mule . It would first have to consult with Mexican officials over what it considered exorbitant prices . Cussing the delay , which would cost them 50 a mule a day for feed , most of the dealers went home to await further word . <P> Make It on Horses . But not Ferd Owen . He went right on rounding up more mules . While the Department of Agriculture hemmed &; hawed , he flew down to Mexico City to see Mexican officials himself . When he went home , Owen carried a contract to sell the Mexican Government 20,000 mules at the handsome price of $115 a head . That just about eliminated everyone else . <P> By such fast maneuvering , slender , affable Ferd Owen , 58 , has become the biggest mule and horse trader in the U.S. His natty suits , hickory cane , and diamond stickpin ( shaped like a mule 's head ) belie his origin as the fifth of nine sons of a poor Missouri farmer . Ferd went to school for only six months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a " road trader , " driving all over the Midwest in a covered wagon and swapping animals with farmers along the road . That sharpened his trader 's eye ; now he can tell an animal 's value as soon as it takes a few steps in the auction ring . <P> Lose It on Zinc . When he was 18 and still on the road , Owen met Bertie Keen , who married him , taught him to read &; write and joined his business as a bookkeeper . In 1922 , they opened a trading barn in Kansas City 's stockyards , slowly developed it into a center for a widespread trading network . <P> Owen does a bigger volume of trading ( about 200,000 horses and mules a year ) than anyone else in the U.S. <P> Owen 's dickering urge is so strong that his wife is hardly able to get him to buy her a new saddle horse : " He 's likely to sell it on the way home . " Away from horseflesh , Owen is not so shrewd . Recently he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he expects to make up much of the loss on his Mexican deal . Already he has shipped 1,000 mules , has another 1,000 ready to go . He figures on filling the rest of his contract long before Congress gets around to doing anything about mules .
