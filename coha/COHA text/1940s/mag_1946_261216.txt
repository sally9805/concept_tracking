You may make her fast and pack your gear <P> Leave her , Johnny , leave her . <P> And leave her moored to a West Street pier , <P> It 's time for us to leave her . <P> - From " Songs of American Sailormen " Cursing the Government , Johnny left her . He left her moored to West Street piers in Manhattan , to the Embarcadero in San Francisco , to the docks of Boston , Seattle and New Orleans . Last week Johnny was on the biggest maritime strike in U.S. history-a strike , moreover , in theory as well as fact against the Government . <P> The Hitch . The Government 's troubles with Johnny began last spring , when , as now , the Administration was trying to hold the wage and price line and control the nation 's economy . C.I.O. 's Johnny , led by Harry Bridges and Joe Curran , demanded higher wages . The operators , directed by the War Shipping Administration , granted a $17.50-a-month boost , which was approved by the Wage Stabilization Board . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C.I.O. dominates the East ) watched all this with interest . A.F.L. 's seamen 's unions have enjoyed a slightly higher wage scale than the Communist-dominated C.I.O. maritime union . But this boost put C.I.O. out ahead . The A.F.L. bosses howled for a boost too . They threatened to strike . They ordered occasional work stoppages so everyone would get the idea . <P> " Hit the Bricks . " The owners of A.F.L.-manned ships got the idea . They agreed to A.F.L. demands which put A.F.L. ahead of C.I.O. again . They were influenced by two facts : 1 ) of the two unions they prefer A.F.L. ; 2 ) their business is booming . <P> There was one hitch . The Wage Stabilization Board had to approve . Seldom had a Government board found itself in a hotter spot . To approve meant : 1 ) cracking once again the Administration 's well-fractured wage line , 2 ) inciting C.I.O. 's Johnny to come back for another helping . To disapprove meant : 1 ) rejecting the principle of what everyone still insisted was collective bargaining , 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second course . A.F.L. 's Johnny gave the Board one chance to change its mind , then struck . <P> Hardboiled Harry Lundeberg ' in the West , and in the East , medium-boiled John Hawk of the A.F.L. Seafarers International , yanked out 43,000 men . Longshoremen , tugboat men , radiomen , masters , mates and pilots announced that they would support the strike . Machinists in repair yards " hit the bricks . " Even C.I.O. 's wily Johnny announced that he would respect A.F.L. 's picket lines , although he promised to work UNRRA ships. * <P> " Those Phonies . " At week 's end some half a million men were out of work , some 1,500 U.S. ships were immobilized , 280,000 tons of food and relief goods for overseas shipments were blocked . New York , also embarrassed by a truck strike ( see below ) , wondered how long it would eat . Everyone looked hopefully and reproachfully at the Government . <P> Everyone , that is , but Johnny . His white cap cocked , Harry Lundeberg gave his considered opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warned Schwellenbach and the WSB that when this union takes a strike vote it means it . Old sister Schwellenbach keeps calling me but he 's wasting the taxpayers ' money . Even Ma Perkins was better than him . We 're not playing politics , we 're counting our economic strength .
