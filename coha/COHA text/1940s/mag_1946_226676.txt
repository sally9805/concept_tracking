Phonograph albums-like books , lithographs and neckties-were on sale last week in limited editions . A new company called Concert Hall Society , Inc. announced that it would turn out only 2,000 copies of its albums . For $105 , Concert Hall promised twelve albums of previously unrecorded music by Henry Purcell , Beethoven ( Scottish Songs , sung by Balladeer Richard Dyer-Bennet ) , Brahms , Stravinsky , Bla Bartk and others . <P> Concert Hall cuts directly from " masters , " eliminating the " mother " and " stamper " discs used for mass production of commercial records . Concert Hall Society 's first releases-Prokofiev 's Second String Quartet by the Gordon String Quartet , and Aaron Copland 's Piano Sonata and Our Town Suite by Leo Smit-were high quality recordings , but nothing to make other record companies change their ways . Concert Hall 's virtue was its decision to record unfamiliar music . <P> Other new records : <P> Mozart : Concerto In E Flat Major for two pianos and orchestra ( Vitya Vronsky and Victor Babin with the Robin Hood Dell Orchestra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mozart composed this bright piece for his two-piano concerts with Josepha Aurnhammer ( of whom he wrote : " The young lady is a fright but plays enchantingly " ) . Performance : excellent . <P> Beethoven : Piano Sonata No. 8 ( Pathtique ) in C Minor ( Erno Balogh , Vox , 4 sides ; Rudolf Serkin , Columbia , 6 sides ) . Two versions of a much-needed recording . Balogh plays with grace , Serkin with passion . Performance of both : good . <P> Brahms : Second Sonata in E Flat for Clarinet and Piano ( Benny Goodman and Nadia Reisenberg ; Columbia , 6 sides ) . Brahms at his banal worst ; Goodman at his technical best . <P> Kreisler : Concerto in C in the style of Vivaldi ( Fritz Kreisler , with the Victor String Orchestra , Donald Voorhees conducting ; Victor , 4 sides ) . For 30 years Fiddler Kreisler credited this lyrical score to the 18th Century composer Vivaldi , but finally admitted writing it himself . Performance : good . <P> Richard Strauss : Songs ( Lotte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Columbia , 4 sides ) . The great lieder singer 's first album of Strauss songs . Included are the haunting Allerseelen and the popular Morgen . Performance : excellent . <P> Milhaud : Suite Franchise ( New York Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra , Darius Milhaud conducting ; Columbia , 4 sides ) . Light-hearted folk tunes from five French provinces which homesick Exile Milhaud first put together during the war for Edwin Franko Goldman 's brass band . Performance : good . <P> Bernstein : Fancy Free ( Ballet Theatre Orchestra , Leonard Bernstein conducting , with Billie Holiday ; Decca , 8 sides ) . The jaunty , jazzy ballet score with inappropriate lyrics sung-by blue-voiced Billie Holiday . Performance : fair .
