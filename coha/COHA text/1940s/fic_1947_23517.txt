THE UNBUDGEABLE MISS Q UILLOCK A Story WILLIAM C. WHITE T HE war agency in which I worked mushroomed up after Pearl Harbor and could never find enough trained government hands . Willing amateurs held jobs in administration and management that needed long Civil Service training and experience . A salting of career people helped to straighten their mistakes , advised on shortcuts and how to cover up after taking them . But in most of the management , personnel , and other front office jobs were people who never in their lives had written a justification for a pay raise , had tried to draw up a departmental budget that would pass the Budget Bureau and a Congressional Committee , or had hired or fired a man by proper governmental procedure . When Miss Quiliock came along our personnel officer was a fat and very patriotic Mr. Limington , an ex-salesman for a chair factory . He said little about his past except that he had taken this government job at great financial sacrifice . He preferred to talk about his postwar plans in which he aimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Motors . The more Manhattans he drank , after hours , the greener his plans grew and the more generous he was with job applicants . It was by a stream of Manhattans that Mr. Limington ran into Miss Quiliock . She was past forty , short and solid , with square jaws , square hips , and squaredshoulders . She had had fifteen years of government service in Washington and now Chicago . She said she was an able secretary . She wanted a job in the East . " Sure , sure , " Limington said , with the divine air of wholesale mountain moving that government service often inspires . " Come in see me in a couple days and there 'll be a place for you right in my office . We need good people bad . " He made a note on a bar napkin . T wo days later Miss Quillock appeared in Limington 's office . He vaguely remembered her and said something about needing a few more days and would she please fill out a fifty-seven , an application blank , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasantly , handing him the long form completed . " I know quite a bit about Civil Service , as I told you . I have had more than fifteen years of it . Besides , I took the liberty of arranging my own transfer from Chicago . My superior was very glad to help me and signed the proper papers to expedite my transfer . You need only sign these three papers , two of them in quadruplicate , as you know , and everything will be in order . " She laid neatly typed transfer forms on his desk . Limington was pleased by her briskness . As he put her on the payroll he even congratulated himself on the accuracy of his 011MMI  --  Ill ? .1 ? 00A. quick judgment . People experienced in government were so hard to find . As an afterthought he checked through her papers and happened to notice that she had worked in eleven different government offices in five years . Curious about that , he called one of her first employers . He called one of her more recent employers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at times but she was a dreadful person to have in an office , neurotic , high strung , fearful of persecution and threatening suicide , as bad as an active case of cholera to employees ' morale , and afflicted with notions of grandeur that ignored a superior 's wishes . Every man who had had to take her spent most of his time thereafter trying to pass her on to another unsuspecting agency , always with the best of references . The colleague to whom Limington temporarily assigned the woman came back in a day and said she was too jumpy and jittery to have around . Either she be moved or he would quit . Limington then offloaded her on another innocent . He was back in two days with the same ultimatum . By this time she was known around the office and no one would take her and Limington did not want her now in his own office . He thought of sending her to one of our overseas offices but he knew that our medical examiner had the gift of seventh sight about neuroses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of offering her to a number of other government agencies but knew what would happen as soon as they saw her varied employment record . He found himself thinking of little except getting rid of her . The global war , of which he had never been overly conscious anyway , receded . After a few days he made a decision and called in one of his personnel assistants . " I want you to fire Miss Quillock at once but do it so that she wo n't know she 's being fired . I mean , so she thinks it 's for organizational reasons and nothing personal . See ? " " Why do n't you do it ? You hired her ! " " It 's sort of involved , " Limington said , looking out the window . " In a way I 'm not sure what she might do to herself when she heard the bad news  --  she 's very high strung . You have a safe inside office on the second floor and I have this place , on the sixth floor with these damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T HE assistant , who had never even fired a drunken housemaid , called her into his office . Keeping his eye on the jar of paper clips on his desk , he began without much confidence about the way an organization 's plans change and how jobs once urgent have a way of disappearing in a big organization and oft times people have to be disappointed by such an organization , not through any fault of theirs . Each new phrase shortened the friendly smile on Miss Quillock 's face . She interrupted , " What are you trying to say , young man ? " " I 'm trying to say that our organization 's plans change . " " You have already said that . Three times . What has that to do with me ? " " Well , you see ? " He looked for encouragement from the silvery eyes of the paper clips and got none . " This is not meant personally but ? " Her smile returned suddenly and even warmer . " Are you trying to tell me that you want me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistant . " I am . " Miss Quillock looked relieved . " Then that is clear and we understand each other . Thank you . " The assistant , scarcely believing it could be over as quickly and as easily as that , looked up for the first time . " But ? " Miss Quillock teetered on the word , " I refuse to resign so you must discharge me and that is quite complicated . You know , I have been in Civil Service fifteen years . " She started to the door . " Since none of you will assign me to a definite place here you will find me in your library from nine until six , awaiting assignment . If you look that up in your manual you will find it in order . " She left with no sign of ill feeling . A moment later she returned , with the smile of a person eager to be helpful . " You see , young man , if you want to discharge me you must first file charges against me with the Civil Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The assistant reported to Limington who had waited impatiently for news of the skirmish . Having to draw up charges depressed him . " After all , " he admitted , " she has n't refused to work . It 's just her personality . " He knew he would have no peace in his office or any other thought in his mind until he had settled her so he said , " Very well , I 'll handle her . " H E CALLED her in to his office . Keeping an eye on the window he told her sternly that she was fired and that he would prepare proper charges . " Of course , " he added , " you 'll go on leave without pay tomorrow . " Miss Quillock agreed . " By Civil Service procedure that is the proper thing to do . But leave without pay is not convenient for me just now . I intend to fight my case . In the meantime I need my salary . " Limington repeated angrily , " Leave without pay , tomorrow . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharply . " As such I think your methods for recruiting personnel for a public agency are very bad . Recruiting strangers at cocktail bars ! Promising them jobs after a few drinks ! Not making the slightest investigation ! How can you know whom you will pick up ? " She looked very unhappy at having to deliver a reprimand . " I do not believe the Civil Service Commission would approve such recruiting methods and I should hate to have to report that to the Commission . " She did not go on leave without pay but continued to wait in the library , nine to six each day , and never a minute late . Limington wrote up the charges  --  personality unfit for work . During the four weeks until the Commission could be expected to act , Limington assured himself , her unearned salary would only be a drop in the whole war budget and some waste was inevitable in war . Each day Miss Quillock came to him to ask pleasantly is she could be of any assistance . At the end of four weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission . When he said no she smiled , " Of course , Mr. Limington , even if you had an answer it would not be quite legal , would it ? " Like a schoolteacher who had guided generations of pesky schoolboys to maturity she said , " You forgot something , you know : to furnish me with a copy ofthe charges and ten days to reply before filing them with the Commission . Now you have wasted all this time with me still on the payroll . " Limington handed her a copy of the charges , feeling that the war would be over for him the day he got her off the payroll . He waited a week for her answer and got none . He waited another week , then called her and asked for her answer . Miss Quillock smiled very pleasantly . " Are you sure you gave me a copy of the charges , Mr. Limington ? " " Gave them to you ? " he exploded . " You came and demanded them . " " But can you prove you gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Civil Service manual says the charges must be sent by registered mail . And I do n't believe you did that , did you ? " CURE of the answer , Limington rather wearily called Mr. Windle , the only experienced and professional civil servant in the fiscal and personnel section . Windle backed up Miss Quillock . No matter what Limington might say about handing charges across his desk , they should have been sent by registered mail . Then he asked for more details about the case . Limington gave them gladly while Windle frowned and grunted . " So she thinks she knows Civil Service ? " He had thirty years of such service behind him , where it shows . " Let me handle her . " Scarcely believing that relief could come so soon , Limington gladly surrendered the whole thing . For Windle it was a chance to work off his chronic resentment at amateurs put over him in government . " The first thing , " he said , " is to put her on leave without pay . That 's the way you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that . The poor woman would starve . Besides , let 's not use tech-nicalities . " Windle brushed that aside . " Technicalities are the tools that get things done in government . Without them , government would break down . " Miss Quillock might taunt Liming-ton by offering advice but she could not do that to Windle . He set out to act sternly , as a model civil servant who would not be fooled by anyone with less than half his years in government . He called her in , told her her rights , and with broad jaw pushed forward , awaited any argument . A Civil Service manual was on his desk in front of him if she cared to bring up any fine points . " Let me have your rebuttal of charges , " he told her , " then , after the Commission renders a decision , you may appeal . That will take six weeks or more . Until then , you go on leave without pay . " Miss Quillock listened to the voice of solid authority . She said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my case handled by a man of long experience . " Windle sat too solidly to be budged by flattery . " So , come back and see me in about six weeks ' time . In the meanwhile you 're on leave without pay . " Miss Quillock sat solidly too . " You make up the payroll and authenticate it , do n't you , Mr. Windle ? And you 're bonded , are n't you ? " Windle admitted both of those things without knowing what they had to do with her . " For these many weeks , " she continued , " you have approved payment to me as secretary when it is common knowledge in this office that I have not done a stroke of work and have had no assignment . " " What of it ? " Windle asked gruffly . " Things like that ca n't be helped . " Miss Quillock would not accept that answer . " The Commission would probably overlook such carelessness in office management in an amateur , but when people like you and I , old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what 's going on in our offices before we approve payment of government funds . When I worked in WPA one administrator , in a similar situation , was forced to repay all the money he had approved . " Windle , who had his own postwar dream of being a CAF 15 , the top classification in Civil Service , and who had a justification in at the moment for a raise in pay from CAF 12 to CAF 13 , knew what she meant . " See here , " he shouted , wanting more time to think , " I was in Civil Service when you were still in high school . " " Precisely what the Commission might say , " Miss Quillock replied . S HE went back to the library . Windle S went to the Civil Service manual . For the next three days he walked about with the look of a man trapped in a paper baler . When Limington asked , " Fired her yet ? " Windle growled , " She 's got hold of a technicality for the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job was to certify the daily time sheets for the payroll clerks . The sheets had places on them after each name for signing time in and time out . All morning he and his assistants were working on them for the next payday . It was a tedious job and Windle disliked it . After lunch he happened to see Miss Quillock pass his door , smiling peacefully from her sunny vantage place . His frown darkened , he bit the end of the pencil in his hand , and he glared at the time sheets spread over his desk . A moment later he hurried out to the table at the door where the time sheet for that day was clipped to a board . He examined it , saw what he wanted , and grabbed it from its holder . Then he went back to his office and summoned Miss Quillock . " What time is it ? " he asked as she came in the doorway . " Time ? " Miss Quillock looked puzzled . " It 's about two-twenty . " The smile of triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He brandished the day 's time sheet at her . " If that 's the time , why have you signed out today at six , when the day is not yet over ? " Miss Quillock 's face showed she knew the touch of the ep6e when she felt it . " But everyone here signs in and out when they come in in the morning . It 's done like that in most offices ? " " By beginners , perhaps , " Windle said , " but old government hands should know it is a serious infraction of rules . " He sat back in his chair , his broad shoulders straight again . " I 'm putting you on leave without pay , Miss Quillock . If you care to protest that to the Commission ? " Miss Quillock turned and left his office . A few days later she sent in her resignation . When her new employers , the Red Cross , called Mr. Limington for a reference , he gave her a fine one .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
