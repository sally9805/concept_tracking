txt Easing Subway Congestion GERALD L. KAUFMAN . Letters . to The Times Easing Subway Congestion To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : From an architect 's viewpoint , it seems that traffic congestion in the subways could be reduced by the expedient of designating doors at the ends of each car for entrance only , and doors at the center of each car for exit only . With appropriate signs inside and outside each car , the struggles at every door could be avoided . People entering at end doors would learn to move directly toward the center of each car , to be near exit doors . People waiting for trains would wait near entrance-door stopping-places , to be ready to walk in as soon as they were opened . This change might require a few weeks ' education of the public , but would result in simultaneous loading and unloading of passengers , with ' a gain in time , comfort and perhaps courtesy . If it eventually eliminated the need for " porter-pushmen , " there would be a saving in operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subway riders ' clothing and tempers , would it not be worth while trying ? GERALD Lt. KAUFMAN . New York , Feb. 28 , 1947.
