txt AID TO ITALY HINTED German Officers Said to Be in ' De Facto ' Charge of Africa Campaign SUEZ IS HELD OBJECTIVE London Does Not Doubt Reich Troops Are in South , as Invasion Danger Fades By The United Press . LONDON , Oct. ** officials reported today that the German High Command had taken " de facto " charge of Italian military operations and may be sending troops to Italy for a joint Axis drive across Egypt toward the Suez Canal . These reports , indicating a strong offensive to cut Britain 's Mediterranean lifeline , were cited as possible explanation for recent allegations that Italy was demanding control over Syria and Lebanon , including French air and naval bases . " The German masters have taken de facto charge of Italian operations , " British military leaders asserted . ?

Fascist Advance Halted The Fascist offensive in Egypt has advanced to Sidi Barrani , seventy-five miles into Egypt , but for more than two weeks it has been halted , with the Italians failing to attempt further gains and constantly subjected to heavy attacks by British air and naval forces . In the past forty-eight hours British air forces have strongly attacked Italian bases in North Africa , especially along the Mediterranean coast where Marshal Rodolfo Graziani has been attempting to build up and protect his supply lines to the desert battle front . It was said here that the Italians have been gradually building up their positions at and about Sidi Barrani and to the south across the coastal plain they are constructing more or less permanent bases .

It was pointed out in British quarters that recent Axis comment has indicated that the Germans are preparing for a prolongation of the war throughout the Winter and that Chancellor Hitler and Premier Mussolini may have decided , after failing to crush the resistance of the British Isles , to attempt a strong Winter drive in Africa . Invasion Danger Held Past LONDON , Oct. 2 ( ' ) ? Despite the magnitude of today 's aerial assault , certain British military circles said it appeared certain now that the time for an attempt at invasion had passed for this year , and that the main theatre of the Battle for Britain would be transferred soon to Africa . They suggested that Egypt would be the great Winter battleground , with the British bases at Matruh and Alexandria the likely first objectives of a joint German-Italian push . If it came , these sources added , it would be " rough going " for the Axis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 113 ) ? The Manchester Guardian said today that British " watchfulness must extend more and more to the Mediterranean , for on events there the empire 's future may depend . " The Guardian commented " that the R. A. F. 's success during the last month permits us to be confident about the future of the Battle of Britain .

" Nazis Cite Winter Problem BERLIN , Thursday , Oct. 3 ( UP ) ? German quarters suggested early today that , with Winter weather about to handicap bombing operations against Britain , the main battle front of the war soon may shift to the Mediterranean zone . Authorized spokesmen insisted , however , that Italy does not need help and said that Germany is not " likely " to participate in Italian military operations in North Africa , except for a motorized Nazi company now in Ethiopia and a few Germans serving the Italian forces as photography experts . Without suggesting German intervention in the Mediterranean , some Nazi quarters said that as Germany 's bombers are increasingly handicapped by storm clouds enshrouding England this Winter , the " most important " Axis military activity undoubtedly will shift to the attacks on Egypt , the Suez Canal and other British outposts .                    @
