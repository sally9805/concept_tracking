txt MEAT EATING will likely grow still more costly before it turns cheaper . The meat supply this month equals a yearly consumption rate of 139 pounds per capita , say the experts . But next month . they estimate , it will dip to 130 pounds . It should climb to 136 pounds in September , and then keep rising into the fourth quarter . The fundamental factor behind stratospheric meat prices is this : While public employment and buying power have soared to record levels in the post-war years . the meat animal population has declined . Today there are 54 cattle and calves for each 100 people ; in 1944 there were 62 per 100 persons . There are now about 38 hogs per 100 people ; in 1944 there were 61 . Lofty feed prices , moreover . have kept cattle and hogs from being fed to heavier weights ( more meat ) before slaughter . Since January , only 548.000 head of cattle have been put in corn-belt feed lots for fattening . In the comparable period of 1947 , the total was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ livestock feeding more profitable from time Oft . The resulting Increase in meat supplies may be substantial n. - xt year , with prices trimmed . But , barring a general ' recession , " do n't ei.rp , et anything like a meat price collapse this year . SUGAR 'S PRICE RISE at the end of June was probably the last for some time . This quarter-cent-a-pound lift in the price of the refined sweet was the first since sugar went out from under price control last fall . It followed an 800,000-ton cut by the Agriculture Secretary in the amount of sugar that can be marketed in the U. S. this year . But since that big cut in the marketing " quota . " was made , the Agriculture Secretary has reallocated to Puerto Rico and Cuba a 175.000-ton chunk of the quota which had earlier been assigned to Hawaii , Louisiana and Florida . The latter areas would not have been able to supply this 175,000 tons . Puerto Rico and Cuba can easily deliver it . And this reallocated sugar , stay the experts , should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GLUTS grow woree In the cheat country as harvesting rolls northward . Grain mer. u. rite Thalecitas and Minnesota expect an acute box car shortage to develop soon . Harvesting has begun in South Dakota two weeks ahead of schedule  --  with most of the wheat-moving box cars still tied up in the southwest . Many Dakota farmers held back their lastyear 's grain for higher prices after the February price break . Now they are being forced to move the grain into country elevators to make way for the 1948 crop . As a result elevators are being jammed with last year 's wheat at the very time they should be emptied for this year 's crop . Meanwhile . as the grain piles up at home . crop prospects grow steadily brighter in Europe  --  the continent that has been draining away big U. S. surpluses . Late last week the Agriculture Department officially estimated non-Russian Europe 's 1948 wheat output at 1.4 billion bushels . That 's 40 ' above last year and just a thin 6% below the pre-war normal . Prices tell hoto the world grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Kansas City Just last January now sells for $2.15 ? nearly a dollar cheaper . ? COFFEE DRINKING rides high on fullemployment prosperity . The nation will import some 2.6 billion pounds of the beverage bean this year . That 's about a fourth more than was imported yearly just before the war . Skyrocketing prices apparently do not curb the breakfast thirst . Coffee beans now worth fractionally less than 27 cents a pound sold for 71. , cents in 1939 u.HALF. : MEAT helps Canada 's British Columbia beat the high cost of living . The province 's whale fleet has taken 75 of the huge mammals so far this season . And Vancouver housewives are grabbing whale steaks at 39 cents a pound . Beef in Vancouver costs 55 to 60 cents a pound . ( They think that 's " high " in Canada . ) ? SILK CONSUNIVTION perks up . The country used some 29,000 bales ( about 132 pounds each ) in the first six months of 1948 . Only 12,000 bales were consumed in the first half of 1917 . Silk is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Worth $2 75 a pound today , it sold above $3 in 1911 . Before the war the U. S imported over - 150.000 bales of silk yearly . ? POTATO FLOUR production becomes a thrhing business . Output this year will top 150 million pounds , ten times normal production . Behind the boom : A government offer to buy 448 million pounds  --  much more than will be available  --  for relief distribution in Europe . To take care of the big demand , government scientists are enlisting distillers and food processors . They show owners how to put unused machinery to work making potato flour at low cost and point out that there 'll be a mountain of surplus spuds available in 1948 . Biggest single contract let to date : Publicker Industries , for 100 million pounds . Supporting pricea on the 19 , , 8 potato crop has already cost the government some $16 million . The cost mill gn much higher if the full year 's production is as big as expected . ? NEW YORK APPLE.S are hard hit .
