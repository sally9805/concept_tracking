They involve about $3,000 , - 000 . Guy A. Thompson , trustee of the railroad , presented the proposal to representatives of the unions this afternoon at a twenty-minute conference in the railroad 's headquarters here . the union leaders immediately took up consideration of the company 's offer . R. E. Davidson , assistant grand chief of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and spokesman for the - unions , said the unions had made no proposal to the company as yet . He added , however , " We 'll submit something after a study . " " We are making every effort to settle this , " he said . " That 's our immediate concern . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Under Mr. Thompson 's proposal , the cases would be stricken from the strike docket of 282 claims . The unions were requested to submit similar cases they were willing to withdraw . The company proposed that once these cases were stricken from the docket , the remaining unsettled claims be thrown into the machinery of the Railway Labor Act for final determination , and the strike be called off . Previously in Washington the unions offered to withdraw eighty cases for ? future consideration . Mr. Thompson said any one of five ways for settlement , under the act , would be acceptable to him . These were decisions by the National Railroad Adjustment Board , by a system adjustment board for the Missouri Pacific , by arbitration , by neutral referee or by the courts . , The brotherhoods , Locomotive Engineers , Railroad Trainmen , Enginemen and Firemen and the Order of Railway Conductors , earlier had rejected arbitration as first suggested by the company , a Presidential fact-finding board and the National Railway Mediation Board .

Mr. Davidson , described the company 's offer as " exactly the same " as that made in Washington before ' negotiations collapsed ten days ago .

Mr. Thompson left it up to the unions to select the particular method . No new meeting date was set but Mr. Davidson said the parties Would get together when the unions had finished their discussions . The company 's proposal called , for outright payment on six of the BAY-nine ? cases . Three others would be settled outright also , but subject to a check of facts . Fortytwo cases , involving extra work , would be settled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside of daily routine . The unions seek a full day 's pay . The company offered to pay for the actual time worked with a minimum of one hour 's pay . Mr. Thompson noted in his letter to the unions that during discussions with the Mediation Board in Washington that each side had stated that " the strike docket should be cleared of cases to the extent practicable by the parties . " In proposing that the cases remaining after the strike docket had been cleared of as many claims as possible be referred to one of the five Federal avenues for settlement , he said : " They have repeatedly been the subject of thorough discussion and review with you . We believe that every approach to these issues has been fully explored by each side . " Nevertheless , they are still in dispute because we sincerely disagree with your interpretation of applicable rules . You are , no doubt , equally sincere in the belief that your interpretation of said rules is correct . " In such a situation , it seems clear and certain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would only result in delay in the ultimate settlement of the dispute , in prolonging a strike disastrous to the public , the employes and the carrier .
