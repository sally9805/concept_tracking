On the India-Burma front , British soldiers searched a Jap prisoner , found an order from a Japanese colonel concluding : " It is essential to foster between officers and men a spiritual union of happy death together . " <P> Inspired , a British bard posted this : <P> Eve of Battle ( Sung lugubriously by a Japanese private ) <P> With what exquisite sorrow <P> I look forward to tomorrow , <P> To my sniffing of the cannon 's scented breath ; <P> I think with tearful pleasure <P> Of our future ageless leisure , United-officers and men-in happy death . <P> From the heights of my despair I shall tremulously dare , Courageously to kick and squeal and <P> bite ; <P> Although we turn and run , Yet our battle will be won , Happy officers and men in death unite . <P> So I 'll dry my joyful tears , <P> Disregard my glorious fears , <P> Gathering courage from the thoughts of the Eternal ; <P> And I 'll seize this happy chance , <P> And to certain death advance , <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propaganda idle . Leaflets dropped on the British carried this message : <P> " Home sweet home .. . . London Bridge . . . Boats float there and there and British streets dimly lit yet invitingly seen . All family except one sitting by fireside softly singing . There is no place like home . Who is singing ? Could it be wife ? "
