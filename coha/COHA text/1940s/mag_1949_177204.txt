On two successive Sundays , Frenchmen voted on candidates for their local Conseils Gnraux , which vaguely resemble U.S. state legislatures in function . The results analyzed this week showed that the Communists still had nearly 25% of the popular vote . But without losing much numerical strength in the electorate , Reds faced a worsened position in French politics . Whenever a Communist had a chance of getting elected , all other parties tended to combine against him . In the last ( 1945 ) cantonal elections , Communists got 184 seats ; this time , anti-Red coalitions held Communist victories to 37 . The Gaullists got 29% of the popular vote , and the government coalition of Socialists , Radicals and Popular Republicans did even better , with 35% . Failure of the Communist appeal to the Socialist rank &; file meant that the Gaullist attitude toward Communism had pervaded the government parties . The political center of gravity in France had shifted to the right center . Continued progress toward economic recovery would keep it there .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
