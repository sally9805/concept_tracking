Mr. Thurlow leaped to his feet . " Preposterous ! " he cried . " The demandant is not entitled to a third of the gross rentals , but only of the net rentals after deductingmortgage interest . The most she can be awarded is thirteen thousand , five hundred dollars , or one third of forty thousand dollars . " " That is not what the law says , " retorted Mr. Tutt . " Chapter 189 , Section i reads : She shall be entitled to the possession and profits of one third of the real estate , ' and Section 4 provides that she shall have dower in the land , if mortgaged , as against every person except the mortgagee . ' In other words , she is entitled to one third of the entire rents without deducting mortgage interest . The mortgage is the tenant 's own skunk to skin . " " Any such ridiculous method of computation , " roared Mr. Thurlow , " would strip my client of his entire income during the life of his former wife ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag ? " suggestedMr . Tutt syly . " And why not ? " " It would be utterly unethical and inequitable ! " shouted the Honorable Enoch . " Pardon me , Mr. Thurlow , " interposed the judge . " The words unethical and inequitable ' strike strangely upon my ear . Have you any cases in this state bearing upon the point ? " " So far as I am aware , no Massachusetts court has ever been asked to rule upon such a fantastic proposition ! " thundered the great Thurlow . " It would amount to making my client a mere agent to collect the rents for the benefit of his former wife ! " A thin smile played for a moment about Judge Buxton 's lips . " While it might not be law , " he mused aloud , " it would certainly be justice ! " " But it is the law , if Your Honor so holds ! " asserted Mr. Tutt . " However , there is another way to skin the same skunk . Althoughp51the fact may not have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one million , three hundred thousand dollars , which has been held by the Trimount Realty Company for the past thirty years , is about to fall due . The property , assessed twenty years ago at two million dollars , has so depreciated in value that if sold under foreclosure today it would not bring the amount of the mortgage . In other words , unless Di Fratto can renew it , the equity will be wiped out and he will get nothing . But "  --  and he looked triumphantly at the collapsed Antonio " but he can not renew that mortgage unless my client joins in the renewal and waives her dower . Whatever the court may hold regardingthe partition of rents under the facts of the present case , there will be no rents from this property unless she gives her consent , since it will pass into the hands of the mortgagee , which will thereupon collect them for its own benefit . I therefore make the defendant an offer . My client will join in a renewal of the mortgage and thus continue the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a judgment awarding her thirty-nine thousand dollars of the gross rents , he to receive one thousand dollars  --  his estimated nuisance value and to keep him off relief . Will you take it or leave it , Mr. Machiavelli di Fratto ? " Hazel jumped to her feet , her hat askew . " How d'y ' expect me to live on a measly thousand bucks a year ? " she screamed . Rosario pulled her down and clapped his hand over her mouth . His Honor regarded her struggles for a moment with interested disapproval . Then he turned to Mr. Tutt . " What makes you think that the Trimount Realty Company would renew so large a mortgageunder the circumstances ? " " Because its officers have so advised me , " answered the old man . " The Trimount Realty Company is a corporation organized many years ago by the late Winthrop Eustace to protect the realty interests of his family  --  the stock , profits and income to be heldp52in the hands of trustees until his youngest grandchild shall becomeof age . After seeing a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good thing to have all his eggs in one basket , so he played safe by putting the largest mortgage on his property that he could , and invested the money in other ways . Events have proved how wise he was . My client , Mrs. Carhart , is the last of his descendants . She will be twenty-one in May . It makes no difference to her whether the trust of which she is now the sole beneficiary takes over the property under foreclosure and executes new leases to the tenants , or whether the mortgage is renewed and the present leases stand . Does the defendant accept my offer ? " Toni 's high forehead glistened and his jaw was trembling as he went into a huddle with his attorneys . There was an excited jabber of Italian interspersed with reverberations in Websterian English . Then they broke away and the great Mr. Thurlow arose and stalked contemptuously from the room . " Well , have you decided what to do ? " inquired the judge . Rosario shoved Di Fratto to his feet . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winked at Mr. Tutt . " Drop in on us again sometime . If there 's nothing else on the calendar , adjourn court . " The little refugees were romping in the square below the Eustacemansion when the old man , with Sally and Jimmy Carhart , came down Beacon Hill . " I 'm glad the good work can still go on ! " Mr. Tutt said , as they shook hands . " Good-by , my dears ! " " There 's one question I 'd like to ask you , " said Sally . " How did you know so much about that mortgage Grandfather Eustace put on the property ? " " I drew it , " answered Mr. Tutt.  |p53SHERIFF  MOSES HIGGINS , descending the steps of P. of H. Hall No. 769 , raised his eyes from the front page of the Pottsville Clarion to the weather-beaten wooden effigy of King Wagamoc standing outside Colson 's tobacco shop . " Howdy , chief ! " he remarked to the redskin . " Heap big Indian ! How ! " Coincidently he was confronted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorney , a red-faced man with sideburns , who carried under his arm a mysterious roll of blueprints . " Hello , sheriff ! " exclaimed Mason . " You 're just the man I wanted to see . Sit down on the edge of the horse trough a minute . Have a seegar ? " " No , " curtly answered Mose , " but I 'll set . What is it this time ? " " Of course you understand what I 'm going to say is strictly confidential . " The squire lowered his voice . " But I 've got inside information that the Government is going to build a munitions plant near here . That 'll mean a big boom in Pottsville . Folks 'll be pourin ' in by the thousand and need someplace to stay . Now , I got an idea . " He unfolded an architect 's drawing for a modernistichotel covering the entire north side of the square . " I 've got it all worked out . The Sacred Camels own half the land and I own the other half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corporation and put up a new hotel in. place of the present buildings ? "  | " Where 's the money comin ' from ? " sagely inquired the sheriff . " From my bank . I 'll take a mortgage secured by the stock , but we 'll own the building together and the Camels can have the whole upper floor for a clubhouse , rent free , and the use of all the hotel services . " " Would n't we have to put in any money at all ? " " Not a dime ! " Mason cleared his throat . " Naturally , I 'd expect you to elect me a member of your organization . " At that moment the sheriff caught sight of a familiar figure in a stovepipe hat in front of the courthouse . " Let 's ask Mr. Tutt what he thinks of it , " he suggested . " Hey , Eph ! Come on over here a minute ! Mason 's got a propositionhe says 'll give the Camels a brand-new clubhouse fer nuthin ' . " Mr. Tutt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across , spread his coattails and sat down while the squire unfolded his plan . " You say you have inside information about what the Governmentis going to do ? " he mused . " I have . Right from the horse 's mouth too ! " " Any objection to telling the sheriff and me how you come by it ? " " I 've got my own private wires into Washington . " " But who is at the other end ? " " Ca n't tell ye that . Must n't ask me , " dodged the squire , hintingvaguely at clandestine connections with officials in the War Department and the Council of National Defense . " How I get this is nobody 's business . You would n't expect me to give away my informant , would you ? " " I would n't , because you have n't any ! " retorted the old man . " This is just a scheme to get hold of the P. of H. Hall without paying for it . You could foreclose your mortgage and freeze usp55out whenever you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mercy through your control of the stock . " " You got me all wrong ! " protested Mason . " You do n't suppose if I was a member of the brotherhood I 'd do anything like that ? " " So that 's the nigger in the woodpile ! " Mr. Tutt stared at him contemptuously . " You a Camel ? Jumping Jehoshaphat ! Only over my dead body ! " " Then , by Godfrey , I 'll build my hotel alone ! " shouted the squire , ' brandishing his frustrated plans . " And the Sacred Camels can go straight to  --  to  --  hell ! " The village of Pottsville in upper New York State was settled in the earlier days of the eighteenth century by Dutch and Englishpioneers , augmented a century later by less hardy adventurers who dropped  --  or fell  --  off their covered wagons on the great trek west along the Mohawk Valley ; but while it boasts an Indian burial ground , a Dutch farmhouse with curving eaves and a brick mansion dating from the time of Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Ephraim Tutt arrived there on his first fishing trip about 1920 . Then things started to happen , and it had been a regular dogfight between him and the HonorableHezekiah Mason ever since . Up to that time the squire had been riding high , wide and handsome , but although he was the richest man in town , with a strangle hold on most of the local real estate , there had remained one distinction he had been unable to achieve  --  membership in the Sacred Camels of King Menelik , a local lodge of the Brotherhoodof Abyssinian Mysteries . Twelve times in the course of thirty years he had managed to get ' himself nominated , and twelve times he had been unanimouslyblackballed to a chorus of jeers and what is generally known as " the bird , " or " raspberry . " What made it worse was that practically everyone in town , irrespective of his economic status , was a Camel ; the only obvious exception being Joe , the bellhop at the Phoenix House , and even Joe was a Grand Constableof the Congo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( colored ) in the lodge over at Fonda . It filled the squire with a special concentrated venom when on Friday evenings he saw the boys trooping across the square to P. of H. Hall , and heard the sounds of raucous revelry emanating from its upper story , where the Knights of the Purple Mountains held their meetings . Then it was that his bank accounts , his mortgages , the securities in his safe-deposit vault , all turned to Dead Sea fruit . Hamlets like Pottsville still survive , even in the Empire State . It is the kind of place where the movie house runs but two nights a week and the barber shop is open only after six o'clock on Saturdays . There is a smutty little railroad station known as " the deppo , " a memorial library of funereal granite , and a village square which looks like a Currier and Ives print , and whose octagonal horse trough is the center of gravity  --  and often of mirth  --  of the entire county . The south side of the square is bounded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cy Pennypacker 's Art Foto Salon ; on the north side , opposite , stood , at the time of which we write , two ancient eyesores known respectively as the Brick Block , belonging to Squire Mason , and P. of H. Hall No. 769 , owned by the Sacred Camels of King Menelik . Both were rattle-trap affairs of dull red brick from the kilns at Canajoharie , both had Grecian portals , rectangular windowsand identical facades ,  --  architectural twins , except that the original iron cornice of the hall had been replaced by another representing a range of jagged bright blue hills , emblematical of the Purple Mountains of Abyssinia . For years it had been the ambition of the Sacred Camels top57erect a modern clubhouse , but such a building would have cost at least fifty thousand dollars , and for a long time they had been actually in the red . They were all poor men , to whom the annual dues of fifteen dollars were not an unconsidered trifle ; all valued their membership highly , and , in spite of the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride in the ancient edifice that housed them . As Mr. Tutt , paraphrasing the famous words of William Pitt , once said , " It may be frail ; its roof may shake ; the wind may blow through it ; the storms may enter , the rain may enter , but Squire Mason  --  not on your tintype ! " Once more he had made good his word . As Mr. Tutt had divined , Mason had no information whatever about any munitionsplant to be erected near Pottsville . His proposition had been merely a trick to induce the Camels to elect him a member or at least to secure their property , and his present declaration that he would build a hotel on his own land had been an empty threat . But now , before discarding the thought entirely , he instructed his architect to draw up a new rough plan and secure tentative estimates , including the cost of demolishing the Brick Block . It was while he was fiddling with these figures that he stumbled upon the Hitleresque idea that ultimately changed the face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take him in , or , if they refused , to annihilate their building . The two ramshacklystructures were so old and their timbers so rotten that it was doubtful whether either could remain standing without support from the other . If Mason tore down the Brick Block , particularly if he excavated foundations for a new building , a hundredto one the P. of H. Hall would topple over into the hole ; and the decisions were unanimous to the effect that in such an event he would have no liability for the damage thus caused . The rule had been definitely established in Thurston vs . Hancock , 12 Mass. 220 , and had been universally followed ever since . His gleep58upon making this discovery was unbounded , for , the law being clear , he was satisfied that his mere threat to turn their hall to rubble would lead them to capitulate . Scare ' em enough and he 'd get what he wanted without having to do a blamed thing . No one took him seriously until one day a couple of surveyors appeared , coincident with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , the town burst into an uproar of excitement , in the midst of which the Honorable Hezekiahcalled upon Sheriff Higgins . This time his approach was less conciliatory . " See here , sheriff ! " said he sternly . " My surveyors tell me that your hall bulges over at least five inches on my side of the line . " " Is that so ? " remarked Mose . " I hope it do n't put you to no inconvenience . " " I should n't have said anything about it , " answered Mason , " if I had n't been speculatin ' as to what might happen if I tore my building down . Your hall would be in a kind of precarious situation , would n't it ? " " What arc you drivin ' at ? " " Nothing , except that I do n't want to make any unnecessary trouble for you fellers . To build my new hotel I 'll have to do quite some excavatin ' , and if the grange topples over onto my land , you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sheriff was flabbergasted . " Holy mackerel ! " he exclaimed . " You would n't do a thing like that to us ! " " I would n't be doing anything I had n't a perfect right to . If I dig a hole next your property , all you 're entitled to is the support of your land in its natural state . If your building collapses becauseof its added weight , that 's up to you . The law 's absolutely settled . Come over to my office and I 'll show it to you . " " Is n't there anything we can do about it ? " " We-e-11 , " replied Mason , " I ai n't so set on building my hotelp59that I would n't give up the idea if I was to become a Sacred Camel . But I want you to understand that I mean business . " Sheriff Higgins restrained a desire to strangle him . " You 'll have to give us time to think it over . We do n't meet until Friday . When are you goin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday noon , " said Mason . " If I ai n't a duly elected Sacred Camel of King Menelik by that time , I start tearin ' down at seven o'clock Monday mornin ' . " Next Friday evening the top floor of the grange was crowded to capacity , since Grand Supreme Exalted Patriarch and Ruler of the Purple Mountains of Abyssinia Higgins had sent out word that , in addition to the usual " raising " or new members , he had a communication of utmost importance to impart . Now , arrayed in red-plumed chapeau , golden epaulets , embroideredstomacher and vermilion trousers , he was about to complete the initiation of a kneeling neophyte . Stepping forward , he tapped him upon the cranium with his mace and intoned , " Wherefore I now hereby declare you to be a duly elected and installed brother of the Purple Mountains of Abyssinia and a member of the Herd of Sacred Camels of our beloved King Menelik , entitled to all the privileges appertaining thereto , includingthat of paying fifteen dollars per annum to my Deputy , Grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance . Arise , 0 Sacred Camel , my brother ! " The neophyte having arisen , Sheriff Higgins replaced his mace upon its velvet cushion and took a swallow from a discolored tumbler . " We now come , " said he , " to a matter of vital concern to all of us . You all remember how , when Squire Mason tried to flimflamus into building a hotel and we turned him down , he threatened to do it by himself . We thought he was only bluffin ' , but itp60appears now that he 's goin ' ahead . He 's pullin ' down the Brick Block next Monday mornin ' . " The assembled Camels perked up their ears . For the squire to lay out real money was news . " All the better fer us , " remarked Grand Supreme Exalted Sergeant at Arms Pennypacker , who , in his regalia of Grand Lion of Judah , was hardly recognizable as the timid proprietor of the Art Foto Salon . " It 'll increase the value of our property . " " If our durned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But Mason says he 'll have to dig so fur down that she 's bound to topple over . " " Why not have the law on him ? " demanded Grand Supreme Exalted Scribe Toggery Bill Gookin from the other end of the platform . " Ca n't we git an injunction or something ? " " No . The law 's on his side . I 've read it myself . We ca n't do nothing . " " D'y mean if the old buzzard sees fit to dig a hole next door to us , he kin keep on until the grange falls into it ? " " Yessir ! I do ! So long as he gives us notice and he exercises due care , he can dig clear through to Chiny and take us along with him . We 're bulgin ' over near half a foot on his side of the line already . " " Ai n't there no alternative ? " plaintively inquired the Grand Lion of Judah . The sheriff made a most unpatriarchal grimace . " We kin buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member he 'll nacherly have such a fraternal attachment fer all of us that he wo n't do noth-ing . " The silence following this announcement was broken by the Exalted Keeper of Wampum , " If I ever saw that old shyster kneeling stem foremost up there on the platform , I know what would happen to him ! " THE CAMELS ARE COMING 61 " Looks as though he 'd got us this time ! " groaned Pennypacker . " It 's only sense that a man can dig as deep as he wants on his own land , same as he can build up into the air . " " Why not elect him and afterwards all of us resign ? " suggestedToggery Bill . " Then we might reorganize over ag'in withouthim  --  call ourselves the Holy Camels of Melchizedek or some-thing ? " " What good would that do ? " argued the Grand Lion of Judah . " It would n't stop him diggin ' after he found it out , would it ? " " Blackmailer ! " " Scalawag ! " " Crook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Order ! " shouted Mose , pounding with his mace in an effort to quell the turmoil . " Listen , boys ! We got to face the facts . Unless we elect the squire , we 'll sure lose our hall and wo n't have no place to meet . So we better elect him , whatever we may do afterwards . " " All right . I second him ! " growled Toggery . " But I 'll shove him down the stairs fust chance I git . " The sheriff rapped on the table . " Hezekiah Mason having been duly nominated as a Sacred Camel of King Menelik , the Sergeant at Arms will pass the ballot box ! " The Grand Lion of Judah , laying aside his chapeau and tasseledsword , walked along the benches holding out a corn popper lined with newspaper ; then , having ascended the platform , he counted the beans , assisted by the Keeper of Wampum . There were sixteen white and sixteen black  --  a tie . " In that case the chair has the decidin ' vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate the old rascal , I do n't see any way out of it .

" He was about to drop in the fateful token of defeat when there was a commotion at the door and Mr. Tutt entered in his fishingtogs.  | " Sorry to be late , boys , " he said . " Excuse my costume . What 's the excitement ? " " We 've elected Hezekiah Mason , " explained the sheriff . " Mason ! " " Had to do it ! Otherwise we 'll lose the hall . I 've just cast the decidin ' vote and the Keeper of Wampum is about to announce the result . " Mr. Tutt strode forward . " Wait a minute ! " he cried . " I 've been a member of this lodge for twenty years . I want to know why you propose to perpetrate this outrage , and I demand the right to vote . " " That 's right . Mr. Tutt is entitled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think , Eph ? " anxiously inquired the sheriff , after he had explained what it was all about . The old man frowned , rubbing his chin . " It looks as if we were on the spot , " he said at length . " But do n't let 's act hastily . Mason may be only bluffing . Even if he is n't , I , for one , would rather see the old hall a dust pile than Mason a Sacred Camel . " Forthwithhe picked up a black bean and placed it in the corn popper . " It 's a tie ! " shrilled Bellows . " Squire Mason ai n't elected yit ! " " And never will be ! " declared Mr. Tutt . " Brother Camels , leave this to me ! I 've never failed you heretofore and I shall not now ! I give you my word ! " The Honorable Hezekiah , in his office across the square , had feverishly awaited the outcome , expecting the momentary arrival of an emissary in full regalia to escort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lights of the hall were at length extinguished , he became apprehensive . Would they possiblydare to defy him ? When Saturday passed and no word of his election came , he was plunged into gloom . The last thing hep63wanted to do was to build a hotel . It was risky business . The Mick Block earned its taxes . He 'd leave it be . Meanwhile , ignorant of the squire 's change of heart , the convictionspread among the Sacred Camels of good King Menelik that they had been unwise in allowing themselves to be stampeded by old Tutt . If Mason carried out his threat , where would they ever find another meeting place ? The old lawyer , who had spent Saturday morning in the courthouse library , returned at lunchtimeto find a delegation headed by the sheriff awaiting him on the piazza of the Phoenix House . " We 've reconsidered , " stated Mose sheepishly . " Of course we 've got the greatest confidence in you , Eph , but this here is too ticklish a piece of business to take any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better part of valor and that we 'd better accept the squire 's terms . " The others nodded agreement . Mr. Tutt 's eye swept the circle in disgust . " I 'm surprised at you ! " he cried . " Are you mice or Camels ? " " I do n't like bein ' blackmailed any more than you do , " replied the sheriff , " but I 've got a personal responsibility towards the brotherhood . How can we stand by and watch him destroy our property when we 've only got to elect him a member in order to prevent it ? " " Are you so scared that you 're ready to give up without a fight ? " challenged the old man . " Ca n't you even wait to see whether or not he intends to carry out his threat ? " " That 's right , boys , " put in Pennypacker . " Why not do as Mr. Tutt says ? If the squire means business , it 'll be time enough to crawfish when he starts something . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " so long as we keep Mason from destroying our building . It would be the end of us . " That was how things stood at five minutes to seven on the historic Monday of Pottsville 's Munich . Each side was prepared , if necessary , to give in at the last moment , yet each was putting up the boldest face possible . News of the crisis had gone abroad and , in addition to most of the townsfolk , the square was filled with farmers who had driven in to see the fun . The Sacred Camels of King Menelik were massed defiantly around the P. of H. Hall , Chief Wagamoc had been removed to a place of safety , and the Honorable Hezekiah stood on the sidewalk in front of the Brick Block , watch in hand , while wreckers swarmed upon the roof . Since he had definitely decided to do nothing , he was calm and composed . At exactly seven o'clock one of his surveyors was going to drive up , and after an earnest consultation Mason would nod his head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be called off . But it did not work out that way . Mr. Ephraim Tutt unexpectedlyappeared at an open window just over the Grecian porticoand raised his hand for silence . " Citizens of Pottsville and Sacred Camels of King Menelik ! " he cried . " Hezekiah Mason has no intention of tearing down the Brick Block , for he knows that , if he does , we shall make him pay through the nose ! This is merely a bluff to try to force us to elect him a member of our order ! I dare him to go ahead and wreck his building ! I challenge him to prove that he is not a liar and a fourflusher ! " A cheer arose from the square . " Call his bluff ! " " Show up the old buzzard ! " The blood rushing to the squire 's head blurred his sight . He 'd show old Tutt whether he was a fourflusher ! He would n't join the Sacred Camels now if they begged him to on their knees ! Casting discretion to the winds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go ahead and tear the gol-blasted thing down ! " he yelled  |p65Next  instant the air was filled with bricks , tiles and flying timbers . Mose Higgins hurried to where Mason stood . " Stop ! " he cried . " Everything 's all fixed ! We 'll elect you ! You can be a Sacred Camel in twenty minutes ! " But the squire only cast at him a look of hatred . " Sacred Camels be damned ! I wo n't join ! Nothin ' ai n't goin ' to stop me now ! " And nothing did . By noon the roof and cornice had been ripped off , and by nightfall the top story knocked down . Two days later the entire Brick Block had been demolished . Pottsville looked as if it had lost a front tooth . Then , the debris having been removed , a bulldozer and an excavator began to graze among the foundations . The hall shivered and shook , a huge fissure appeared in the Purple Mountains of Abyssinia , and , though the building still stood , it gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individually and collectively , begged the squire to desist , but he was adamant . Indeed , he now took a fiendish joy in his destructive course . Every time the ponderous jaws of the excavator grabbed up a mouthful of earth and emptiedit into a waiting truck , he felt as if he were delivering a blow on Mr. Tutt 's solar plexus . A fourflusher , was he ? Deeper and deeper grew the gaping crater . Then came the final moment of the squire 's triumph . Amid shouts of warning , the earth beneath the ancient structure suddenlygave way , the walls buckled outward and , with a crackling roar P. of H. Hall No. 769 crashed into the hole amid a cloud of dust . Pottsville had lost its other front tooth . It was at that moment that Mr. Tutt bobbed up again . Mose Higgins , watching the cataclysm from the edge of the horse trough , felt a touch upon his knee , and looked down to see the old man standing there with a typewritten paper in his hand . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angrily  |p66Mr  . Tutt handed him a fountain pen . " Keep your shirt on , sheriff , " he said quietly , pointing to a dotted line . " Sign there . " The Honorable Hezekiah , exultant , stood gloating at the scene of destruction . " Looks as if a bomb had hit it ! " he chuckled . Directly in front of him across the sidewalk lay intact the cornice with its jagged skyline of bright blue . To emphasize his contempt , the squire jumped vindictively with both feet upon the sacred emblem , which , not being in stable equilibrium , promptly tipped up and precipitated him head foremost into the excavation . It was a small price to pay for his revenge , but as he clambered out , covered with earth and mortar , he found himself confronted by Grand Lion of Judah Pennypacker , who thrust some papers into his hands . They were the summons and complaint in a damage suit for a hundred thousand dollars . " There 's no need to waste your honor 's time hearing a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of The Sacred Camels of King Menelik versus Mason at length came up for trial before Judge Tompkins . " I concede that the plaintiff and myself are adjoining landowners and that , as a result of an excavation on my side of the line , their building collapsedand became a total loss . " " In that case I shall call only one witness , " replied Mr. Tutt , " unless , perhaps , my opponent is ready to concede something else . " " What is it ? " inquired Mason . " That the land on which both these buildings stood originally belonged to the Indians . " Judge Tompkins smiled indulgently as a titter rippled over the courtroom . Indians ! That was a good one ! But Mason was suspicious . " What have Indians got to do with it ? " he demanded.  | " It 's quite obvious that Squire Mason wo n't concede any Indians , " remarked Tompkins . " Call your witness , Mr. Tutt . " For three months the old man had been getting it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a legal ignoramus or of having double-crossed the Brotherhood  --  and , in consequence , he had gone back to the city , only to reappear when the case was called . Now , however , he was in his usual good humor and nothing in his manner indicated any consciousness of sin or apprehensionas to the result of the trial . " Will Mr. Ezra Badman please take the chair ? " he said quietly . Mr. Bodman , the register of deeds for Patterson County , a withered nonagenarian with a parchmentlike skull , but with eyes as sharp and quick as a robin 's , tottered forward , hugging a huge time-stained volume . " Are you familiar with the title to the property on the north side of the village square where the P. of H. Hall and the Brick Block used to stand ? " asked Mr. Tutt . " Yes , indeed ! " replied Mr. Bodman in a high-pitched cackle . " Both from my records and from personal recollection . " " Please give us a brief account of its history . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting ! " he answered eagerly . " I have a memo of it all right here . Arendt Van Corlear , a cousin of the great patroon , William Van Rensselaer , bought one hundred and twenty-eight square miles from Wagamoc , the Mohawk sachem , for  --  I quote  --  ' 600 hands of good Whyte Wampum , six Koates of Duffels , thirty Barres of Lead , and nine Bagges of Powder . ' Quaint , is it not ? " King Wagamoc lived almost on this very spot . He called his village Chuctanwemla . You all know the old Indian trail to Turtle Pond and the burying ground at Turkey Hollow ? Why , this very courthouse is on part of the same property ! You canp68read the whole story in the records of the dispute between the Schenectady and Kayaderosseras Patents in 1768 .

At the beginning of the Civil War , Jacob De Groot built at his own expense a barracks , or cantonment , for volunteers , and gave the use of it to the Government . Well , after the war no one wanted it , so for some years it stood there empty . Then the Patrons of Husbandry bought it in 1868 . They kept the walls exactly as they were  --  just put on a cornice and a front porch . Afterwards they sold it to the Sacred Camels . " " The same structure that De Groot had built ? " " Yes , the identical building . " " Now how about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Jacob De Groot sold that to a man named Abner Kent in 1875 . Squire Mason 's title runs straight back to him . " " So that prior to 1868 the two pieces of land belonged to a common owner and , before either was sold , formed part of a single tract ? " " Exactly . First it belonged to King Wagamoc , the Mohawk chieftain , and afterwards to Adam De Groot and his heirs right down to 186g . " " Thank you , Mr. Bodman . I have no further questions . "  | " Neither have I , " snorted Squire Mason . He stopped suddenly at the look of whimsical triumph on Mr. Tutt 's wrinkled face . Could the Indians have anything to do with it ? " The plaintiff rests . " " So does the defense , " countered the squire . " I move that the court dismiss the complaint on the ground that the plaintiff has failed to make out a cause of action . " Judge Tompkins had been watching Mr. Tutt with a puzzled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had n't made a case . However , it was none of the judge 's business . " I will hear you , Mr. Mason , " he said to the squire . Confidently the squire arose and , balancing himself upon his heels and with the tips of his fingers arched against each other over his abdomen , began his argument . He was , he asserted , astounded that his learned adversary was so ignorant of the elementaryprinciples of law governing the rights of adjacent landowners . Any first-year law student ought to know that the only duty of providing lateral support owed by one to the other was in regard to the soil on the neighboring land in its natural state , unencumbered with artificial structures . That had been settled once and for all in Thurston vs . Hancock , 12 Mass. 220 , and followedever since . Here the weight of the building had caused its collapse . He therefore demanded that the complaint be dismissed with costs . The Honorable Hezekiah mopped his forehead with a red silk handkerchief and , with an exultant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knitted his brows . As far as he could see , he had no choice but to throw the case out of court . " I think that Squire Mason has correctly stated the law , " he said . " What have you to say in reply , Mr. Tutt ? " The old man unjointed his lanky form . " Only this . " He tapped a couple of dusty law reports beside him . " Though Squire Mason has correctly stated the general rule , he has overlooked a well established , if little known , exception to it . One who sells that part of a piece of property on which is a building and keeps the rest is bound to do nothing to disturb the status quo of what he has sold . That is only common sense . Hence , when Jacob De Groot conveyed his barracks to the Patrons of Husbandry , he bound himself not to do anything on the land he retained which would damage the building he had sold to them , and every subsequentpurchaser , from Abner Kent to Squire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Poppycock ! " shouted the Honorable Hezekiah . " Our Court of Appeals has so held in Paine vs . Chandler , 134 New York 385 , " said Mr. Tutt , " and the same rule obtains in other jurisdictions , as , for example , in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin . I might add that , while it is easy to tear things down in this world , in the end one usually has to pay for them and , " he added significantly , " that whoso diggeth a pit is apt to fall into it himself . " Mr. Tutt handed one of the volumes to judge Tompkins , who buried his nose in Paine vs . Chandler . " Where on earth did you find that one , Eph ? " he whispered as he handed it back . " Right in the courthouse library , " grinned the old man . Mason sat stunned , his mouth half open . Judge Tompkins rapped with his gavel . " I shall grant Mr , . Tutt 's motion and direct a verdict for the plaintiff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , Mose , " said Mr. Tutt a month later , as , in the impassivepresence of King Wagamoc , he handed the sheriff Mason 's certified check for thirty-five thousand dollars , at which the dam/ages had been assessed , " the Camels always wanted a new clubhouse , and now they can have it . " The Grand Supreme Exalted Patriarch of the Purple Mountainsran his fingers through his straw-colored thatch . " Geeswax , " he exclaimed admiringly , " that sure was the luckiestbreak ever happened to us ! I s'pose you knew what the law was all the time ? " " Not all the time ! " admitted the old man . " By the way , old Wagamoc deserves a new coat of paint . He gave me the idea . " " Right ! " enthusiastically agreed the sheriff . " Howdy , brother ! Heap big Indian ! "  |p72THE  launch bearing Ephraim Tutt in its stern , with Horse Mackerel Pete on lookout , raced over the long swells of the Bay of Fundy alongside the school of tuna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp hook with its impaled smelt skittered from crest to crest . Just behind it a stream-lined torpedo exploded in a burst of white smoke . Wham ! He struck with all his might and felt the solid weight at the end of the line that screamed from the reel as he sank into the swivel chair and socketed the rod butt in his leather belt . The propellers had been reversed and the launch was encircled by a welter of swirling foam . Mr. Tutt , his legs shaking , began to pump  --  heaving his rod up slowly , loweringit quickly and reeling in  --  but after he had got in all but about seventy feet of line , the tuna refused to budge further and began a systematic plugging , dragging down the rod in steady bends that required all of the old man 's strength to meet . At first it was inspiring to pit his wits and muscle against those of the fish , but after an hour his hands were a mass of blisters and his thumb where it pressed the drag was swollen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could put down the rod for a minute  --  merely rest it on the gunwale . But the instant he did so the tuna inevitably gained on him yard by yard . " It 's a big one ! Shall I take the rod a spell ? " Mr. Tutt glanced indignantly at Ernest Hopkins , the launch 's engineer , standing watchfully at his elbow  --  a lean , sunburned lad of twenty-two , with craggy , finely chiseled Maine features . " Give up my rod ? Not while I can hold it ! " he retorted . Dizzy with fatigue , his back nearly breaking , he struggled on ,  |p73and  at last the tuna began to yield . Inch by inch , he reeled in until he could see the bronze back just under water and the whitegreenflashes as it fought on its side with its head down . Victory was at hand ! Pete unstrapped the harness and released the tremblingold man , who now stood up , the better to bring the fish to gaff . At that instant another launch bore down upon them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hi , there ! " yelled Ernest . " Keep off or you 'll cut our line ! " " Damn you , Sol Murch ! Keep off ! " echoed Pete . The fellow in the launch 's bow , now not forty feet away , made a derisive gesture . " Think you own the ocean ? " he jeered . Bing ! The humming line parted and Mr. Tutt , thrown off balance , pitched backward over the gunwale . Down , down he went , gulping salt water , into a black eternity , but still clinging to his rod . Then his descent was abruptly halted by a grip upon his ankles and he felt himself being dragged roughly backward up into the cockpit . Pete and Ernest , incoherent with rage , were shaking their fists at the now-distant launch . " Jumping Jehoshaphat ! " sputtered the old man as , coughing sea water , he crawled to his feet . " Another of Sol Murch 's dirty tricks ! " blared Ernest . " I ' 11 fix him for this ! That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was fun , though , while it lasted , " said Mr. Tutt grimly . " I guess we 'll call it a day . Do you mind feeling in my overcoat pocket for a bottle of malt extract ? " Ernest , still cursing , started the engine and they headed for the harbor , twelve miles away . Mr. Tutt stripped off his wet clothes , rubbed himself dry , put on an oilskin and dropped limply into the swivel chair.  | " Who was that miserable skunk ? " he called to Ernest in the engine room . " Sol Murch . Him and his dad own pretty near the whole town . " " Does n't seem to like you , " hazarded the lawyer . " Not much love lost between us ! " Horse Mackerel Pete sat down on the gunwale and filled his pipe . " Ernie took his girl away from him , " he confided . " She c 'd ha ' married fifty thousand dollars by sayin ' Yes , ' but she threw it over fer Ernie here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since . " " Who 's the girl ? " " Connie McEwen  --  Cap'n McEwen 's granddaughter  --  the one you 're stayin ' with . Smartest lass in Stone Haven . " " And the prettiest , I should say ! " added the lawyer . " She 's a ball of fire , all right , " agreed Pete . " But Sol Murch 'll make a lot of trouble fer all of ' em before he Bits through . " The sun was hot , and , after a couple of swigs from the bottle , the old man soon felt himself again . Lighting a stogie , he stretched his lean shanks along the gunwale as he might have on the desk in his law office . " How did I ever get out of the water ? " he asked suddenly . Pete chuckled . " Kind of a circus act . When your line was cut you nacherly lost your balance and toppled overboard . You plunged down clear out o ' sight , so Ernie handed me the gaff and went in after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he did n't seem to make no particular headway , so I gaffed him in the pants and hauled you both alongside  --  human-chain effect . " " So Ernest saved my life ? " " In a manner of speakin ' . We 're used to fellers fallin ' overboardaround here . "  |p75Although  Mr. Tutt had passed but one night in Stone Haven , he was already enamored of the old seaport town , once a mar : time metropolis , now only a sleepy fishing village , with its fortyfoottides , its sardine factories , its stilted wharves , and its ancient mariners , some of whom still wore rings in their ears . The stationmasterhad recommended as a guide Horse Mackerel Pete , who in turn had referred him to the McEwens as a paying guest . How on earth did the inhabitants make a living ? " Tell me about Ernest , " he said . " What does he do when the tuna season is over ? " Pete knocked the ashes from his pipe . " ' Bout the same as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only works fer me off and on when he 's nuthin ' else to do . For the last few years he 's been mate of the Ora C , Cap'n McEwen 's lighter . Since the old man got his stroke he 's been in charge of her . But it 's been a terrible had season . Ernest 's an ensign in the Naval Reserve  --  goes off next week into the coast patrol . " " Who 'll command the lighter then ? " " Connie says she 's again ' to . She 's only eighteen , but she 's able . She can pick up a crew any time . But that 's not the trouble . The McEwens are in a mess . They 've even had to take in boarders . They might be able to weather it at that , if it was n't fer this Murch . He kin ruin ' em if he wants to ! " Mr. Tutt pricked up his old ears ; he had a personal interest in Mr. Murch . " How does he come into it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever a vessel went ashore anywheres between Eastport and ' Tit Manan , Cap'n McEwen would go out and salvage it . It always was risky business , and there was n't much in it . What did pay , if a feller had the money , was to buy in the cargo from the underwriters  --  who usually did n't want to bother with it  --  at bargain prices . That 's where the Murches came in . Old Casper had the tackle and the experience , and they had the dough . So they went in together on ap76fifty-fifty basis . They made money , too , and the cap'n built the finest house in town , with a cupola and widder 's walk on the roof . The Ora C 's the best lighter on the coast , but , unfortunately , she ai n't fully paid for . The bank  --  and that really means Murch and Son  --  hez got a conditional bill of sale on her  --  what on land you 'd call a chattel mortgage . The final payment is due next Tuesday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why Sol Murch thought he had a strangle hold on Connie . But she would n't marry him for twelve million , let alone twelve hundred ! Murch is just mean enough to take their lighter . " The launch rounded a rocky island with a lighthouse , passed an ugly-looking reef called the Nubbin about four feet out of water , and swung into the ship channel toward Stone Haven Harbor . Fifteen minutes later they tied up at the float beneath a sagging dock , and Mr. Tutt , the oilskin drawn tight about his meager form , shook hands with the two men and clambered into a decrepit taxi . " Tomorrow morning at eight o'clock , " he said . " We 'll get that tuna  --  or his brother ! " " Wind 's shifted ! " piped Captain McEwen from his wheel chair beside the petunia bed after supper . " We 're goin ' to have a storm . You wo n't git no tuna fishin ' tomorrer . " Mr. Tutt , from where he was oiling his reel on the piazza , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as he could see , there was n't a sign of bad weather anywhere . The promontory on which the McEwen house stood , overlooking the shining estuary of the river , was drenched with sunlight , while the sky overhead was an inverted bowl of cloudless blue . " That 's right ! " agreed his granddaughter from the doorway . " The wind was coming through the west window when I started to wash the dishes and now it 's drawing straight in from the other side . "  |p77For  the first time Mr. Tutt was conscious of an atmospheric change . The hitherto lifeless poplars at the edge of the pasture had begun to shiver and a cold draft to creep in from the bay . Connie , a graceful figure in her dungarees , with the breeze tugging at her yellow hair , shaded her eyes . " I can see it coming ! " she said . " It 's breaking on the Nub-bin . " Captain McEwen motioned with his unparalyzed hand for the brass-bound telescope beside his chair . " Take a squint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There might be sumpthin ' . " She pulled out the telescope and resting it against a pillar of the porch , focussed beyond the Nubbin . " There 's a tow to eastward , and a couple of schooners beating up the reach . The farther one is way down below her Plimsoll . . . . Want to take a look , Mr. Tutt ? Rest the glass on my shoulder . " A leaden shadow was drifting across the ocean already lashed by whitecaps , and the lawyer 's unaccustomed eye had difficulty in picking out the old tub , her decks awash in the surging welter . Even as he looked she headed up into the wind , her sails flappingto be reefed . Connie held the glass to her grandfather 's eye . " Keep it whar ' t is ! " he told her . " By Jimminy ! I 'd know that schooner anywheres by the patch on her fores'l . She 's the old Sally Knox , belongin ' to Captain Israel Brayton , of Rockland . Carries coal from Perth Amboy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the lee of Fox Island she 'll be swamped sure as shootin ' ! . . . Better go down and round up your crew . " " Okay , grandpa ! " The girl turned to Mr. Tutt , her eyes alight .. " You wo n't get any tuna tomorrow ! " " You seem glad of it ! "  | " Not because you 'll lose your fishing , but because this may mean business for McEwen and Company . Come down to the docks and see life ! " The cloud bank had already crossed the zenith and the wind was churning up the inner harbor . Mr. Tutt , hanging on to his stovepipe hat , followed Connie down the hill , past the " Guests " sign at the entrance of the road , and into the main street , where the shopkeepers were putting up their shutters . The small boats were tugging at their moorings and even the schooners made fast to the wharf were pitching . At the head of the dock he collided with Horse Mackerel Pete . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the launch owner . " No use tryin ' to fish until she blows herself out . " Connie crossed to a wooden shack over the water bearing the sign , C. MCEWEN &; Co . " That C ' used to stand for Casper , " she laughed . " Now it stands for Constance ! " It was getting dark , and before seating herself at the desk the girl turned on the lights . Mr. Tutt pulled over a chair , lit a stogie and , picking up a copy of the Eastport Sentinel , listened from behind the stove as she telephoned around the town . She had just located Sam Parker , the Ora 's engineer , when a thickset man with a hawk 's nose and small gray eyes entered , his thin lips gripping the butt of a cigar . Mr. Tutt recognized his enemy of the forenoon . " Evenin ' , Con ! " he said . " Quite a blow ! " " Hello , Sol , " she answered . " Looks as if we might pick up some business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble before morning . " " That 's why I come . The Ory C ai n't what she aster be , and her engine 's out of order , besides . I thought I 'd let you know we wo n't need her no longer . 0 ' course , if you wanted to sell her ,  |p79we  'll take her off your hands and even give you a thousand dollars cash money . " " What do you mean ? " cried Connie . " The Ora C is the ablest lighter this side of Saint John . It wo n't take three hours to put her engines in shape . You know perfectly well that you persuadedgrandfather to invest all his savings in her , so you and he could have a first-class vessel to use in partnership together . " " There ai n't no partnership . You ca n't show no papers . " " Murch and Son and C. McEwen and Company have been in the salvage business for thirty years ! " she retorted hotly . " They 're not going to stop now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandfather ! " " Ernest 'll be in fer the duration after next week . You do n't suppose we 're going to stay in business with a paralytic and a woman , do you ? There 's plenty lighters available . What good is the Ory C if you ca n't man her ? You 're lucky to get rid of her . She wo n't be yours after Tuesday , anyhow . My offer holds good until eleven o'clock tomorrer mornin ' . Think it over ! " Connie sprang to her feet , her eyes ablaze . " This is the meanestlow-down trick I 've ever heard of ! You 're doing it deliberately to prevent our making enough money to pay the last install-ment ! " Murch removed his cigar and stepped toward her with a grin . " Listen , Con , " he coaxed . " Why not have a little common sense ? How about a real partnership between Murch and McEwen , eh ? " He reached for her shoulder , but she ducked away from him . " I hate you ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch me for a hundred lighters . " The door was suddenly flung open . " I 've been looking for you all the afternoon , Sol ! " said Hopkins , closing it behind him . " You cut our line . "  | " Honest now ! That was too bad ! " replied Murch placatingly . " You had the right of way and so we figgered to pass astern . " " You did n't hear us yelling ? " " Sure , we heard you , but we did n't know you was fishing until "  --  he gave a forced laugh  --  " the old guy fell overboard . . . . You ought to ha ' been there , Con ! It was the funniest thing I ever see ! He plumped over like a  --  like a --  " " The way you 're goin ' to right now ! " finished Hopkins for him . Murch stepped back , his face white . " You lay a finger on me , Ernest Hopkins , and I 'll report you to the commander of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll have you up for assault and battery , so you ca n't report on time . What 's more , I 'll take the Ory C without payin ' a cent for her , ' stead of givin ' Con the thousand dollars I just offered . " He edged around the stove and stumbled against Mr. Tutt . " Oh ! " he grunted . " I did n't know you was here . Well , mebbe you kin make this feller see reason . " " You cut my line intentionally , " retorted the old man . " If that is n't a crime hereabouts , it ought to be . " Seeing himself cornered , Murch made a dive for the door , but Ernest sent him sprawling with a blow behind the ear . " Come out and finish this on the dock , you rat ! " he said . The sounds that followed were not those of the wind . " That fixes us , I guess , " said the girl hopelessly . " Sol will never let up on us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . The house rocked as huge gusts spanked the hill , and the rain drove like musketry against the rattling windows . Yet when , in spite of the uproar , he finally fell asleep , he awoke to a silence so uncanny that for a moment he almost fancied that the McEwen mansion , includinghimself , had been blown into everlasting peace . The gale had died down and the rain had ceased , but under the lowering grayp81sky a million white horses were racing shoreward as if spurred on by the booming of the surf upon the islands . Captain McEwen was smoking his pipe in front of the Franklinstove in the sitting room while Connie 's mother busied herself with Mr. Tutt 's breakfast . She laid a warning finger on her lips . " It 's an ill wind that do n't blow no good to somebody , " chuckled the captain innocently . " The Sally Knox has piled up on the Nubbin just as I expected . You kin see what 's left of her lyin ' on her beam ends with her hatches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do to get ashore in the dory . There 's three hundredtons of anthracite in her , worth seventeen dollars and fifty cents a ton delivered at Eastport . Soon ez this sea goes down ; Connie 'll hev to git busy . " Mr. Tutt finished his ham and eggs and lit a stogie . " You mean salvage her ? " he asked . " Yep . She 's a wreck all right . The crew have abandoned her . In fact , all four of ' em took the morning train fer Rockland . Frank and Sol Murch will buy in the coal and Connie 'll salvage it . We 're partners , you know . She 's rounded up her crew al-ready . " Mr. Tutt put on a sou'wester and his watertight fishing coat and descended to the town . On the dock where the Ora C was tied up Connie was addressing a small crowd of longshoremen . " Listen , men ! Sol Murch has just pulled another of his dirty tricks . He 's had Ernest Hopkins locked up on a charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company from salvagingthe Sally Knox . But he wo n't get away with it . I 'm going to salvage her myself . I need six of you . Whoever wants to join up for the venture can have a share in the profits . . . . How long will you be on the engine , Sam ? " The sound of pounding from below was interrupted by the voice of the Ora 's engineer . " Not over a couple of hours ! "  |p82just  then a motorcar drove onto the dock and Sol Murch , with his face heavily bandaged , stepped out . " You 're too late ! " he jeered . " Murch and Son bought the coal on the Sally Knox by telephone this morning from the underwriters , and there 's a lighter already on the way from Eastport to take it off . We 've got you hog-tied . But I do n't want to be too hard on you , Con . You can still have your thousand dollars if you want it . " She turned on him furiously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And mine , " muttered Mr. Tutt to himself on the outskirts of the crowd . He walked back to the empty office of McEwen &; Co . Two hours ! The Murches now not only owned the coal but would reach the wreck first , which would give them the exclusive right to salvage it . The law was only too simple . Until a wreck had been abandoned , no one had the right to touch it , and so long as the captain or other representative of the owner was on board , he could , if he chose , let the ship go to pieces or sink , even if the owner of the cargo demanded otherwise . But once the wreck had been actually abandoned  --  as had the Sally Knox  --  the first person with the necessary equipment to arrive upon the scene had the exclusive right to salvage her . But his blood was up . It was n't so much the loss of his tuna but the advantage this wretched crook proposed to take of his friends , the McEwens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rockland ? Surely he 'd heard that name somewhere ! But in what connection ? He reached for the telephone . " Long distance ? Please get me Captain Israel Brayton , of Rockland , personal call , and step on it ! " He waited impatiently for the answering buzz . " Hello ! Captain Brayton ? . . . This is Eph Tutt , of Newp83York . . . . No , I 'm speaking from Stone Haven , Maine . Are you Israel Brayton , Supreme Patriarch of the Purple Mountains of Abyssinia for the Eastern New England District ? . . . I thought so ! . . . Sure , I 'm a Sacred Camel of King Menelik  --  a Grand Past Master . La illah allah ! Abracadabra  --  and then some ! We met at the Montpelier convocation last August . Listen , Brother Israel . I 'm in a jam . And so are you ! Your schooner , the Sally Knox , piled up on the Nubbin here last night , a total wreck ! . . . Glad of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help me out . Now , as one Sacred Camel to another -- Five minutes later he reached the jail , and in another ten had put up bail for Ernest Hopkins . " I 'm not afraid of losing my money , " he told him . " You wo n't skip with a naval commission in your pocket . . . . No , I do n't want you to board the Ora . The Murches have another lighter on the way and will surely reach the wreck first . We 've got just one chance , and it depends on you . I want you to hire the fastest motorboat in the harbor and have it all ready to start ; then go to the telegraph office , and as soon as a telegram comes for me , bring it out to that wreck , hell bent for leather . I 'll be waiting for you , and so will Connie ! " The old man walked back , with a sly smile on his wrinkled face , to the Ora C , where Sam Parker was still hammering in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tackle and preparing to cast off , while Connie stood at the window of the pilothouse with a telescope glued to her eye . " They 've beaten us ! " she said . " The Panther from Eastport is just off Fox Island , heading in here to take the Murches aboard ! They 'll be on the Nubbin in half an hour ! We 've lost the race ! " " No race is lost until the winner 's nose is on the wire , " declaredMr . Tutt . " Keep your chin up , Connie ! " The lighter , with the smoke pouring from her funnel underp84forced draft , swung past the lighthouse toward the dock where the Murches sat waiting in their automobile . Her bell jangled , a deck hand hove a rope and warped her in , Frank and Sol Murch jumped aboard , and next moment she had headed out again for the Nubbin , only three miles away . Coincidentally , the hammeringin the engine room ceased and Sam stuck his head through the hatchway . " Okay ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No use , Sam ! " answered Connie . " Look ! Sol Murch will have a line across the Sally Knox inside twenty minutes ! . . . It 's all off , boys ! " " One moment ! " interposed Mr. Tutt . " Horse Mackerel Pete 's launch is at the float , and it can make eighteen knots to the Panther 's ten . " " But what 's the use ? " she protested . " Even if we get there first , we ca n't claim any salvage rights ! We 've no tackle ! " " Then come for the ride ! . . . Sam , get up steam as soon as you can and follow us out ! " They lowered themselves into the launch , the spark sputtered , caught , and they were off . The spray dashed over them in sheets , but the tiny boat was fast , and before they reached the mouth of the harbor they had left the Panther well behind . In a few minutes they swept round the Nubbin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't see what this is all about , " muttered Connie . " Wait and , with luck , you will ! " Mr. Tutt assured her . The tide was out , and the schooner , which had struck at full flood , had careened over , breaking off her masts and bowsprit , and now lay nearly bottom up , her hatches under water , but she had remained intact , the weight of her cargo wedging her firmly among the rocks . Nosing the speedboat into an angle between the ledges , theyp85made their way over the slippery kelp onto the Nubbin beneath the Sally Knox . " She certainly is a mess , " said the girl . " Just look at her bottom . She must be fifty years old . I wonder if she was insured . " " Yes , up to the neck ! " grinned the old man . " Possession is nine points of the law ! Connie , my dear , can you help me up on the hull ? " It was something of a job , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid of Horse Mackerel Pete , he managed to swarm over the bow and , availing himself of the keel as a foothold , to perch himself on the hull , where he was joined by Connie . By this time , although the rollers were still pounding the reef , the weather had cleared and the sun had come out bright and warm . Connie looked at Mr. Tutt and laughed . " I must say you 're a good sport ! " she said . " I 'd go further than this with a pretty girl ! " he retorted . " Do you mind , miss , if I smoke ? " " Do you mind if I do , sir ? . . . Well ! Here they come ! " The Panther , plowing through the rollers , rounded the end of the Nubbin , shut off her engine and dropped anchor about a hundred yards off the ledge . Then the group of men gathered in her bow uncoiled a hawser , climbed with it into a dory and rowed ashore . " They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that line to her , " said Connie . Having beached the dory , and dragging the hawser between them , the Panther party struggled over the pulpy seaweed and started up the smooth side of the ledge toward the Sally Knox . At the sight of Mr. Tutt and Connie sitting cross-legged twenty feet above them , they paused and went into a huddle . Then Sol stepped forward . " Say ! " he called . " What are you doin ' up there ? "  |p86Mr  . Tutt , regarding him complacently , exhaled a cloud of stogie smoke . " Looking for tuna , " he informed him solemnly . " That 's a likely place to look out for tuna ! " grunted Murch suspiciously . " You better come down ! We 're goin ' to make fast , and the rope might sweep you off ! " " Thank you , Mr. Murch , " replied the old man . " We like it up here and we prefer to stay . . . . Hold ' em up in any way you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance is in delay . " " Okay ! " Connie peered through her cupped hands toward the distant harbor . " Sam 's got the Ora started at last . She 's already beyond the lighthouse . " " Do you see a speedboat anywhere ? " Mr. Tutt asked . " Not a sign ! . . . Look ! They 're getting ready to run that line over the bow ! " She raised her voice . " Do n't you dare touch this wreck , Sol Murch ! " she called . " Oh , yeah ? Why not ? I own it ! " he answered angrily . " The hull crew abandoned her last night and they 're halfway to Rocklandby this time ! You 're trespassers ! Come on down ! " " We got here first ! " she taunted him . " That do n't make no difference ! You have n't any tackle ! Your possession ai n't effective ! " " It will be inside of ten minutes  --  when the Ora gets here ! " " Answer me ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off there ? " " No , " calmly interposed Mr. Tutt . " We are not coming down . If you want to remove us , you 'll have to do so by force . . . . Hand me up a rock , Pete ! " " Look here ! " protested Murch . " I do n't want to harm an old man like you  --  nor Connie neither ! Be reasonable ! You ai n't no right on this wreck ! I tell you I own it ! "  |p87Mr  . Tutt deftly caught the boulder tossed up to him by Horse Mackerel Pete . " Listen ! " the said , lifting it significantly in both hands . " How do I know that you have any more right here than I have ? " " That 's easy ! " exclaimed Murch , who had retreated at sight of the stone . He pulled a telegram from his pocket . " We bought the cargo by telephone this morning . Listen to this : NEW YORK , N. Y. I0:20 A.M. , SEPT. 27 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" He lowered his voice , " Is there a speedboatin sight yet , Connie ? " She strained her eyes toward a tiny black dot abreast the lighthouse that seemed momentarily to grow bigger . " I see . . . something ! " she hesitated . " It 's Ernest ! How soon can he make it ? " " Five or six minutes . " Murch stood frothing at the mouth . The last thing he wanted  --  particularly after the encounter of last night  --  was personal violence , and Horse Mackerel Pete , with a stone in one hand and his ax in the other , had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and returned it to his pocket . The appearance of thep88Ora C at that moment on the other side of the reef determined his action . " Go ahead , boys ! " he shouted . " Make fast your line ! " Half a dozen of the Panther 's crew ran their hawser over what was left of the bowsprit and took a hitch about the stub of the foremast , Murch waved his hand , the winch rattled and the line was pulled tight just as the Ora dropped anchor alongside . " We 're fast anyway ! " said Murch . " Now you can sit there until hell freezes over ! " From his perch on the keel Mr. Tutt watched the speedboat leaping toward them with Ernest Hopkins standing in its bow . Only a couple of minutes were needed . Murch , undecided as to his next step , had rejoined the group . He had established his legal rights- the only thing left was to get rid of Connie and that old man . " Aw , come on down ! " he urged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My dear Mr. Murch , " blandly replied Mr. Tutt , " it is not this young lady and myself , but you , who are making trouble . Do n't you realize that your ownership of the cargo has no significance ? " " It gives us the right to the coal , do n't it ? " " Sure ! Sure ! " Mr. Tutt took an appreciative whiff from his stogie . " By the way , Mr. Murch , did you ever read The Merchantof Venice ? " " What 's The Merchant of Venice got to do with it ? " Mr. Tutt airily flicked off an ash . The speedboat , with Ernest waving something from the bow , was streaking around the Nubbin in a flash of green-bronze , blue and white  --  just like a tuna !

To paraphrase the poet , you may be entitled to the coal , but not to a splinter of this hull ! You have no right of removal except through the hatches , without injury to the ship . " " Injury to the ship ! You old fool ! There is n't any ship ! This is just a pile of junk . We not only own the coal but as the first folks here able to salvage it , we have the sole legal right to administerthe wreck .

J.Home ofGENERAL JAMES BINGHAM BARTONHERO OF THE ARGONNETHE sign confronted Mr. Ephraim Tuft abruptly on the top of a rise . Bingo Barton ! He had n't laid eyes on him since their sophomore year at Harvard . Good old Bingo ! Rockville was directly on the way to Lake Pocomo , where he was going bass fishing ; he must stop and look him up . As he entered the town 's main thoroughfare , it became apparent that the General was not only Rockville 's most distinguished citizen but its chief claim to fame , since The Barton National Bank faced The Barton MemorialLibrary on the other side of Barton Square . " Can you tell me where to find General Barton ? " he asked at the teller 's window of the bank . A slope-shouldered man with a small head and round applecheeks , like a precocious boy 's , came to the wicket . " General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His doctor has absolutelyforbidden him to see anyone . I 'm Mr. Cranshaw , president of the bank . If it 's a matter of business , I handle all his affairs . " " What is the nature of his illness ? " " Nervous and physical collapse . I 'm afraid he 'll never be any better . "  | " Sorry to hear it , " answered the old lawyer . " I 'm an old collegefriend . Perhaps you can give him my regards ? Tutt is the name  --  Ephraim Tutt . " " If the opportunity presents itself , " replied Mr. Cranshaw , in a tone indicating this to be unlikely . " It is all very sad . The Generalwill be a great loss . " Mr. Tutt returned to his motor with a curious , baffled feeling ; although he could give no reason for it , he had not been favorablyimpressed by Mr. Cranshaw . Too bad about old Bingo . A half hour 's drive on a winding wood road brought him to a bungalow on the shore of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow in olive green , wearing the insigne of a flier . " I 'm Ralph Barton , General Barton 's nephew . Glad to see you ! " he said heartily . " I 'm back on furlough from Kelly Field . My wife is running the camp for the duration . You 're our only guest at present . . . . Hi , Sheila ! Here 's Mr. Tutt ! " A fair-haired , roly-poly girl of not more than twenty came out of the bungalow . " I hope you 'll like it here , " she said , and her cordial handshakeand responsive smile made the old man feel instantly at home . " All our guides have been drafted , but if you 'd like to catch a bass before dinner , I 'll paddle you . The sun is just right and there 's no wind . " Fifteen minutes later they were on their way toward an island near which a solitary fisherman was sitting in a canoe . " We must n't disturb Doctor Peyton , " said the girl . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the shadow . " Mr. Tutt cast and waited . At first nothing happened ; then there was an infinitesimal tug at the end of his line , which began to move slowly through the water beneath his slightly bent tip . He flicked his wrist . Instantly the reel screeched , his lancewood rod was bent double and nearly jerked from his hands as the linep93ran out until it was nearly gone , and suddenly , a hundred and fifty yards away , a big fish jumped , skittering over and over in the air , and crashed back into the water . " My , what a whale ! " gasped Sheila , driving the canoe swiftly toward the widening circle as the old lawyer frantically reeled in his slack . The line tightened again , the rod was drawn heavily down , and  --  whee-e-e !  --  the bass was off again for the other side of the lake . Mr. Tutt clung on for dear life , his arms trembling , his fingers numb , until the rushes gradually became shorter and shorter and , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarry turned over on its side . With a few strong strokes , Sheila brought the canoe alongside and netted it . Her husband , who had been splitting kindling , dropped his ax , ran down and helped them to the float . Coincidently , the other canoe drew alongside and a white-haired man climbed out . " Some fish ! " he nodded genially . " I saw the fight he put up . " " This is Doctor Peyton , Mr. Tutt , " said Sheila . The two oldstersshook hands , and with Ralph carrying the bass , they all climbed up the slope to the scales . " Four and a half pounds ! " exclaimed the airman . " That 's the all-time record for Pocomo  --  perhaps for New Jersey ! " " Why not show it to Uncle Jim ? " suggested Sheila . " It might cheer him up . " " Good idea , " declared the doctor . " Just what he needs . " " I thought General Barton was too ill to see anyone , " hazarded Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his , but a Mr. Cranshaw at the bank said it was out of the question , that his doctor had forbiddenit . " " Nonsense ! " said Peyton . " The Cranshaws have the General hog-tied ! It will do him good to see you , so long as you keep off the war and business . Well , I must beat it for home if I want any dinner . "  | " Who is this Mr. Cranshaw ? " asked Mr. Tutt after the doctor had gone . " Jasper ? Uncle Jim 's alter ego . He 's been with the bank for years  --  the young man who made good . ' He and his sister Cora have moved into the General 's house in order to take care of him better , as they say . I think they 're getting ready to feather their nest . " " How long has he been ill ? " " Five years  --  ever since his wife and sons were drowned out sailing here . That finished Pocomo for him ! Originally he planned to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to leave it to us . Ralph is his only nephew . It 's a wonderful property  --  eight hundred acres of wild land around the best fishing in the state . " Sheila and Mr. Tutt motored to Rockville after dinner , with the bass , bedded in a moss-packed basket , at their feet . General Barton 's colonial mansion stood , amid trees and gardens , diagonallyacross the square from the bank . All the shades were drawn , but Mr. Tutt was conscious of being scrutinized from behind the curtains before a hatchet-faced woman opened the front door . " Good afternoon , Miss Cranshaw , " said Sheila . " We 've got the biggest bass ever caught in Pocomo . May we go up ? " The woman eyed Mr. Tutt suspiciously . " I 'm sorry , " she said firmly , " but he ca n't " Who is it ? Who 's down there ? " came in tremulous voice from above . " It 's me , Uncle Jim ! " called Sheila . " I 've brought an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " Miss Cranshaw bit her lip in annoyance . " I 'll run ahead and prepare him , " said Sheila.  |p95Mr  . Tutt looked around the hall while the two women went upstairs . Over the fireplace hung a crayon portrait of the first Roosevelt in a Rough Rider 's uniform . On one side stood a glass case containing a stained campaign hat and tunic , a piece of torn bunting , a rifle , canteen and haversack . A brass plate bore the words : " Las Guasimas , Cuba , June 24 , 1898 . San Juan , July 1 , 1898 . " He remembered now that Bingo had left college to enlist in the Rough Riders and had been wounded in both actions . Opposite was another case containing the field uniform , side arms and binoculars the General had used in the First World War . On the mantel itself rested a plaque to which were affixed various military decorations , including the Distinguished Service Cross . Mr. Tutt had had no idea that Bingo had been so renowned a soldier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hulking figure bolstered with pillows in the bed . Could this be the madcap , rollicking boy he had known forty-five years ago ? " Hello , Bingo ! " he said . " Do you remember Eph Tutt ? We had some pretty gay times together in the old days . " The sick man smiled feebly in response . " We sure did , Eph . I remember that torchlight procession our freshman year  --  McKinley'selection , was n't it ? We were n't old enough to vote , but we made a hell of a noise ! " Mr. Tutt chuckled . " You led a snake dance in the yard ! " The General patted the lawyer 's hand . " It 's nice to see you , Eph ! What 's this about a bass ? " Sheila brought in the basket . " By golly , that is a big one ! The biggest I ever saw ! " His eyes lighted for a moment , then dulled . " I used to enjoy fishing , but that 's over now , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend to my business . It 's all going to my nephew and Sheila here , but heavenp96only knows what 's going to happen after this war . It 's terrible , the unpreparedness , " he continued . " Nobody 's doing anything to prevent sabotage . Look at our aqueduct and the railroad bridge , totally unprotected . There ought to be men out there patrolling night and day . But they wo n't let me do anything . " Miss Cranshaw , who had taken her stand beside a desk littered with papers , shook her head in warning . " I should be the first to volunteer , " declared the General , sittingup . " I sent in my application to the War Department a month ago , but they 've paid no attention to it . Someone told them I was sick , I guess , but I 'm not too sick to do my bit . Then , when they called everyone to register up to sixty-five , Jasper would n't even let me do that . " " But you 're much too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ! No ! " cried the sick man excitedly . " And I 'm not really sick ! " A shadow darkened the wall and the banker 's pink round face appeared in the doorway . " There , there , General , " he soothed him . " You 've talked enough . " General Barton leaned back and closed his eyes . " Perhaps , if you think so , Jasper , " he answered obediently . " You know best , but I ought to do my part . I always have . " They were breakfasting next morning on the porch overlooking the lake when the telephone rang in the office . " I 'll take it , " said Sheila . Next instant they heard a cry , followed by hysterical sobbing . Ralph hurried inside after her , and a few moments later came out again , looking very grave . " My uncle died last night , " he said . " They found him early this morning , lying under the aqueduct , dressed in his uniform , with his sword beside him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peyton says it was heart failure  --  he did n't suffer . "  | " Too bad ! I 'm glad I saw him yesterday afternoon , " said Mr. Tutt . " How is Sheila taking it ? " " All broken up . She was very fond of him . I think I 'd better go back to her . " General Barton was buried with full military honors . Then came a bombshell that rocked the town . Jasper Cranshaw filed the General 's will and asked to be appointed administrator cum testamento annexo of the Barton estate , on the ground that , since the executor who was named in the will had died since its execution , he was the chief party in interest . Under this will , dated 1931 , six years prior to the death of his family , the testator , having provided for his wife , had , not unnaturally , left all his property in equal shares to such of his children as should survive him . But what flabbergasted Rockvillewas that , in addition to offering this will for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's order , signed three years previously , by which the General had legally adopted him as his son . Ralph and Sheila were stunned . Cranshaw would take practicallyeverything , including Lake Pocomo . It seemed incredible that General Barton , however fond he might have been of his protege , Jasper , should have Intentionally disinherited Ralph , his only nephew and sole surving member of his family . Yet there was no way out of it . The setup had been mechanically perfect . Cranshaw 's confidential relationship to the old man and control of all his papers had given him an unrivaled opportunity to accomplishsafely what otherwise would have required outright forgery . He had only to abstract whatever will the General might have executed after the loss of his sons , thus leaving in effect that of 1931 , and then , by some hocus-pocus , to secure his signature to the adoption papers in order to inherit his entire estate as his legal child.  | The situation challenged all Mr. Tutt 's ingenuity . His antagonismtoward Jasper Cranshaw had been fully justified . Vowing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer appeared before the surrogate , with whom the will had been . filed , and as Ralph 's attorney entered a caveat objecting to the probate . The surrogate , in accordance with New Jersey practice , immediately referred the whole case to the Orphans ' Court , where Mr. Tutt , as proctor for Ralph , asked that the latter , instead of Cranshaw , be appointed administrator of the estate , and secured a month 's adjournment of the hearing . But when these routine legal maneuvers were completed the question remained , What to do next ? Cranshaw , a man of fifty-two , had apparently been a model citizen , who , having entered the General 's bank twenty years before , had remained there ever since , a faithful servant who had reaped his just reward . The adoption petition was in proper form , duly acknowledged by General Barton before a notary summoned from the bank  --  none other than Jasper 's present lawyer , Jacob Goldsmith , who assured Mr. Tutt positively that the General had discussed the contents of the paper with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jasper himself was polite and ostensibly co-operative , offeringto facilitate a search for a later will , and even intimating that he would " do something " for Ralph , should the latter withdraw opposition to his appointment as administrator . But obviously a search would be useless . Undoubtedly , Cranshaw had burned any other will long ago . He had foreseen and covered every angle , and however much suspicion pointed in his direction , it would be utterly impossible to adduce actual proof of any wrongdoing on his part . Daily Mr. Tutt sought sanctuary in the courthouse library , where , surrounded by lawbooks and smoking stogie after stogie , he cudgeled his brain in vain for a solution . " Children , " he said gloomily as they sat around the fire one eve/ning , " I 'm not one usually to abandon hope , but this case has got me stymied . I 'm afraid Cranshaw and Goldsmith have got us licked . " " Uncle Jim was a grand old fellow , " said Ralph . " Whether he knew what he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nephew . " " That 's right , Ralph , " agreed his wife . " We 're young . We can take it . We 've got your Army pay , and after the war we 'll make a fresh start . " Long after they had gone to bed the old lawyer sat staring through his stogie smoke at the glowing logs . What did he really know about the General ? Why should n't he have adopted Cranshawif he wanted to ? Bingo had been a crazy enough coot at Harvard . Maybe he was just the sort of old crank to do the very thing everyone thought so unnatural . There was a Who 's Who on the table ; and he pulled it underthe lamplight . BARTON , Brigadier General James Bingham , banker ; b . Santa Fe , New Mexico , September 5 , 1874 ; s . William and Sarah ( Deacon ) Barton ; m . Marie Edwards , 1908 ; two sons , Edward and Bingham ( died together 1937 ) . Left Harvard Univ . to volunteer in 1st Regt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rough Riders ) at San Antonio , Texas , May 10 , 1898 ; as corporal of Troop C was wounded at Las Guasimas , Cuba , June 24 , 1898 , and at San Juan , July 1 , 1898 . Brig . Gen. AEF , World War . Awarded Distinguished Service Cross for " conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty in action with the enemy in the Meuse-Argonne offensive . " Officer Legion of Honor , France , various decorations from Belgium , Greece , Italy , Holland , etc . Home : Rockville , New Jersey . Some record ! Mulling over it , item by item , Mr. Tuft 's mind reverted to his college days . Through the dusk of the years he could see old Bingo leading that snake dance of torchlight para/ders under the Harvard elms  --  a big , yellow-thatched , rawboned kid from the West . Bingo ! Suddenly he drew his eyebrows togetherand restudied the General 's biography . " Jumping Jehoshaphat , " he muttered . " That 's queer . " Then , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sought his bunk . " When does your leave expire ? " he asked Ralph at breakfast . " I 'm due back at Kelly Field next Thursday . I ca n't stay for the hearing . " " How shall you go ? " " Fly from New York , day after tomorrow . " " I 'll fly with you , " said the old man . " Do n't worry , Sheila . I 'll be back in plenty of time for the finish . " When Mr. Tutt returned to Lake Pocomo a fortnight later , he had mysteriously acquired a heavy tan . During his absence publicinterest in Jasper Cranshaw 's strange adoption had intensified . People had begun to remember things . A lot of them , for example , had heard the General refer to Ralph as his future heir , others vaguely to a new will , and by the morning of the hearing most of them were inclined to believe that there was something rotten in the state of New Jersey , and that it was n't twenty miles from Jasper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was standing room only . Mr. Tutt arose amid a tense silence . " This , Your Honor , " he said , " is a hearing on the probate of a will , presented by Jasper Cranshaw , alleged to be that of the late General James Bingham Barton . Cranshaw , the proponent , has asked that he be appointed administrator cum testamento annexo , because as an adopted child , so he claims , he is the heir to the bulk of the decedent 's property . As proctor for Lieutenant Ralph Barton , now on active service with our Army , the sole heir and next of kin of the General , I have filed a caveat objecting to the probate of the will andWITH HIS BOOTS ( IN 10Ip101to Cranshaw 's request . I wish to make it clear , now , that I do not contest the authenticity of the will , which is undoubtedly genuine . I do question , however , the status of the petitioner under the order of adoption by virtue of which he claims to be the heir of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question here in the very court which had jurisdiction over that adoption , and I should like to put a few questions to Mr. Cranshaw regarding it . " " Mr. Cranshaw can have no objection to that , " nodded Russell , and Jasper , his small head high in the air , walked complacentlyto the witness chair and was sworn . " I shall be glad to answer any questions , " he said genially . " I am sure that Mr. Cranshaw and I will get along famously , " smiled Mr. Tutt . " What is your age , Mr. Cranshaw ? " " I was born on the tenth of June , 1890 , in the town ofHackensack , New Jersey . I am , therefore , fifty-two years of age . " " When did you come to Rockville ? " " In 1922 . I secured a position with General Barton almost at once . " " He became very fond of you ? " " He showed a good deal of interest in my progress . I began as a minor clerk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Did you also act as General Barton 's confidential secretary ? " " Yes , during his last years . " " Did you have access to and charge of his personal papers ? " " I had the combination of his box in the safety vault . " " Were you aware of the existence of the will of 1931 nowoffered for probate ? " " There was a sealed envelope there endorsed , My Will , J. B. Barton , 1931 . ' I did not know its contents . " " Or suspect "  --  Mr. Tutt glanced keenly at him  --  " that under it you might eventually inherit practically his entire estate ? "  | " I had no knowledge of his testamentary intentions . " " Did General Barton , after the loss of his wife and sons , speak to you about making a new will ? " Mr. Cranshaw 's expression became serious . " I had rather expected him to . Instead , he told me that he was a heart-broken old man , that I had acted toward him like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and that he was going to adopt me . " " Were you surprised ? " " Not particularly . I was very grateful . " Mr. Tutt coughed slightly . " Now , Mr. Cranshaw , how old were you at the time of your alleged adoption by General Bar-ton ? " " He adopted me in 1939 ; therefore I was forty-nine . " " As far as you know , did he ever mention to anyone else the fact - of having adopted you ? " " I think he regarded it as a very personal matter . Judge Erskine , who signed the order in camera , died shortly thereafter . No one else was involved . " " Are you sure the General was aware that he had adopted you ? " the old lawyer shot at him . Jasper 's crab-apple cheeks darkened . " I am sure the court will not require me to answer any such insulting question , " he snapped . " Do you think it was his intention that you should inherit practically all of his property ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " In that case , " inquired Mr. Tutt , " how do you explain the fact that he repeatedly told many people now present in this courtroomthat Ralph Barton would inherit all his property , including the Pocomo estate ? " Jasper stirred uneasily . " I never heard of his making any such statement ! " he retorted . " And I do n't believe he ever said so ! "  |p103Mr  . Tutt fumbled with his papers . " General Barton took the war very hard , did n't he ? " " Yes , he became very much excited whenever it was men-tioned . " " Did n't he send his name to the War Department , offering his services ? " " Yes ; but naturally , the idea was ridiculous . " " Did n't he even want to register under the last call ? " " He talked a lot about it , but of course he was overage . " " Are you quite sure of that ? " " Absolutely . Only those up to sixty-five were obliged to register @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that on the afternoon before his death , when your sister Cora told him that he was too old , he said , No ! No ! No ! I must do my part ' ? " " If he did so , it was not in my hearing . " The old lawyer paused , then nodded to the witness . " Thank you , Mr. Cranshaw . That is all . " Jasper glanced with poorly concealed triumph at his attorney . " Mr. Green , please take the stand , " directed Mr. Tutt . A neatly dressed young man stepped forward and was sworn . " Are you the custodian of the archives of Harvard College ? " " I am . " " Have you brought with you the matriculation certificate of James Bingham Barton , who entered with the class of 1900 , but left toward the end of his sophomore year ? " Mr. Green took an envelope from his pocket and removed a faded paper . " I have , in the applicant 's own handwriting . " " What does it state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santa Fe , New Mexico , September 5 , 1878 . ' " Thank you , " said Mr. Tutt . " That is all . . . . Mrs. Barton . "  | A wizened , birdlike little lady with sharp black eyes arose from where she had been sitting , came forward , bowed to Judge Russell , and took the oath . " What is your full name ? " asked the old lawyer . " Sophronia Edwards Barton , " she replied in a clear voice . " I was General Barton 's stepmother . I still live on the old ranch at Santa Fe . " " Take your time , Mrs. Barton , " said Mr. Tutt . " I know that you have come a long way . Incidentally , how did you get here ? " " I flew with you . " A cat's-paw of surprise ruffled the surface of the courtroom . " May I inquire your age ? " " Eighty-one , but I 'm still spry . " " What can you tell us about General Barton 's age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was born September 5 , 1878 . I was visiting at the ranch at the time . His mother , my second cousin , died giving him birth . I stayed on and took care of the baby . A few years later I became his father 's second wife . James was a lovely child , big , strong , and spirited . I brought him up until he was old enough to go East to boarding school . " Mr. Tutt lifted a paper-covered parcel from beneath the table . Opening it , he took out first a large family Bible and then a mounted photograph . " Is this a photograph of the gravestone of General Barton 's mother ? " " It is . As you see , it says : Died , September 5 , 1878 . " " And is this the Barton family Bible ? " " Yes . I brought it with me from Santa Fe  --  or rather you did . " " Will you read the entries ? " " It says under Deaths : Sarah Deacon Barton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Bingham Barton , September 5 , 1878. " '  | " This may all be very interesting as family history , " interpolatedMr . Goldsmith , " but I ca n't see the relevance of it . " " You will before long , " retorted Mr. Tutt . . . . " Now , Mrs. Barton , do you remember when your stepson James enlisted in the Spanish War ? " " I do indeed , " she answered . " James was rather wild and had n't done so well in his studies at Harvard , and one day in the spring of his sophomore year he unexpectedly turned up at the ranch and announced that he was going down to San Antonioto join the Rough Riders . My husband said he did n't want him to and that , anyhow , Colonel Leonard Wood was taking only older men  --  Indian scouts , experienced cowboys and veterans  --  andthat he would n't have a chance . But James was very determined always . " " He had a strong will ? " " He sure had  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saying he guessed the Lord would forgive him if he tacked a few years onto his age . So off he went to San Antonio and , when the recruiting officer asked him how old he was , he said twenty-four . And they took him . " " He added four years to his age in order to go ? " " That 's what he did , " she said . " I guess plenty do it . But once on the Government rolls as born in 1874 , he had to stick to it all his life . " Mr. Goldsmith got up in a bored manner . " Has n't this gone far enough ? " he demanded . " You need n't have made Mrs. Bartonfly all the way from Santa Fe just for this . " " Do you concede that General Barton was born in 1878 and died at the age of sixty-three , instead of sixty-seven ? " " Of course , under the circumstances . What difference does it make ? " " Only that it puts you out of court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jasper Cranshaw 's petition be denied , on the ground that he is not the legally adopted son of the testator . " He opened the book of statutes beside him . " The laws of New jersey  --  Title Two , Chapter Thirty-nine , Sections One to Three  --  explicitlyprovide that anyone adopting an adult must be at least fifteen years older than the person to he adopted . On his own sworn testimony , jasper Cranshaw was but twelve years younger than General Barton , who , therefore , could not legally have adopted him . " Your Honor will agree that this is a most extraordinary case . It outrages reason to suppose that a grand old soldier like General Barton would knowingly have disinherited his only nephew , whom he loved , by adopting an employee already long past middle age . Fortunately , it is not necessary to go into that aspect of the matter . There is many a slip between the cup of injusticeand the lip of cupidity . I had no suspicion of General Barton 's real age , and jasper Cranshaw would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed at the time a trifling incident . On the afternoon of my visit to my old classmate , I happened to mention that in our freshman year we had taken part in a McKinley torchlightprocession of 1896 , upon which the General remarked that , although we were not old enough to vote , we nevertheless  --  as he put it  --  made a hell of a noise . ' Later on , while looking over Who 's Who , I noticed that the date of his birth was given as 1874 , in which case he would have been twenty-two in 1896 , and therefore fully entitled to exercise the suffrage . In this connection , the fact that he seemed vaguely to feel that he ought to register among those now called up to sixty-five years of age , and answered , No ! No ! ' very vehemently when told that he was too old , seemed to support my theory . After that it was easy . The Harvard records having supported my contention , I flew to Santa Fe and , as you see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrivel . There was a burst of applause from the spectators which judge Russell made no effort to suppress . " The petition is denied , " he said . " I declare the order of judge Erskine by which General Barton ostensibly adopted Jasper Cranshawas his son to be null , void and of no effect ; and I appoint Ralph Barton administrator cum testamento annexo of his estate , on the ground that , as next of kin under our laws of inheritance , he is entitled thereto . May I add "  --  and he looked meaningly at Jasper and Mr. Goldsmith  --  " that I have not the slightest doubt but that I am carrying out the General 's intention ? You may proceed to draw the necessary papers , Proctor Tutt. "  |p108THERE  are four places at the West Point Military Academy where future generals traditionally propose to their best girls  --  the shadowy recesses of the beautiful Stanford White Chapel , the balcony of Cullen Hall by moonlight , Flirtation Walk , and Trophy Point overlooking Constitution Island . Cadet Randolph Carter , appropriately arrayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brass buttons , had selected this last on an autumn afternoon in 1941 as the proper spot upon which to ask the most beautiful girl in the world to become his army wife . Beyond her name and that she came from somewhere across the River he did not really know much about her ; and had any one told him that she was the presumptive heiress to twenty million dollars he would have ordered such person to go soak his head . In any event the figure would have meant nothing to him since the Carters , for five generations , had lived only on their army pay . Perched on a gun carriage , her hair gold-red in the sunset behind Chapel Hill , her lips level with his own , Mr. Carter was about to take advantage of his propinquity when the nearby sentry , who had been pacing in the opposite direction , pivoted sharply and started directly towards them . " Of course he 'd have to do that ! " he exclaimed disgustedly , then quickly altering his tactics to meet the situation he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nancy Baxter , " he began as if dictating a military letter , " Subject : matrimony.  --  Will you marry me on June twelfth , next , in the Cadet Chapelp109immediately after the graduation exercises ?  --  Randolph Carter , C.

Have you been stringing me ! " " Of course not ! I just hoped it would n't come to this . I ought to have known , but  --  I could n't help it . It was all so wonder-ful ! " Her words made no sense to him . " But why  --  if it 's so wonderful ? " " Do n't ask me ! " she cried desperately . " But I ca n't !  --  I ca n't ! " Then she slid off the gun carriage and bolted sobbing across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Althoughshe ran like a frightened doe he caught up with her and barred her escape . " No more funny business ! " he ordered . " Why ca n't you marry me ! " Her face was tragic . " Because I 'm married already ! " she wailed . " Oh , Ranny ! What are we going to do ? " Whereupon Miss Baxter with some inconsistency threw herself into Mr. Carter 's arms and buried her head alongside the gold stars on his collar . When Nancy entered the law office of her godfather , Mr. Ephraim Tutt , next morning she looked  --  in spite of her modish coiffure , cocky toque and rouged fingernails  --  more like a sophisticatedchild than a mature debutante of nineteen : Her eyes were as innocent as Little Red Riding Hood 's . " What brings you here at such an unholy hour , little one ? " hep110inquired kissing her smooth cheek . " Have you overdrawn your bank account ? " " I want to get married , " she said , slipping into a chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carter . He 's just too marvelous , Uncle Eph . So gentle and modest , but terribly handsome and intelligent , besides being First Captain and an A ' man too . " " First Captain of what ? " " Of the Cadet Corps at West Point . " " A Westpointer ?

" " I have n't told him . " " Not told your grandfather ! " " I have n't dared . He 'd strangle me ! You see , I was married six months ago to Bertie Couter .

" " Who the hell is Bertie ? " roared her god-father . " Do n't you ever read Walter Winchell or Cholly Knickerbocker ? " she asked incredulously . " Did n't you see that terrible picture of Bertie and me talking to Gloria Vanderbilt in ' Twenty-one ' ? " " I did not ! " he snorted . " I 'm not in cafe society ! When and where , may I ask , did this extraordinary event take place ? " " Last June in Charleston , South Carolina . It was n't exactly ap111marriage . We parted at the church '  --  only it was n't a church , but a judge 's chambers . I 'm in a jam ! " " You 're telling me ! " quoth Mr. Tutt chewing savagely on his stogie .

A chip of the old block and a damned good block it was  --  in spite of everything . Gad , what had n't he been through with that fiery old despot her grandfather , whose fluffy white hair and beard gave him the look of a belligerent Santa Claus ! Both of ' em impetuous , hotheaded , kindhearted , and always in hot water . " Well , let 's have the low-down , " he said grimly . Nancy crunched out her cigarette . " I was having a house-party up at Tranquility Farm . There were twenty of us , including Bertie . He 'd been trying to get me to marry him ever since I came out the autumn before . I liked him well enough . He was older and sort of fascinating . But grandfathercould n't bear him . He even insinuated that Bertie had cheated him playing bridge . He ca n't bear to lose , you know . Well , naturally I stood up for Bertie , and we had a terrific quarrel . Grandpa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , told Bertie that he did n't want to find him there when he got back and that I was not to see him again . Of course you can imagine my reaction to that ! I was mad clear through ! And I was awfully sorry for Bertie . He was practically crying ! " " Crying ! " " Yes , crying . He said he did n't care what grandfather said about him , but to lose me would ruin his life and that I 'd never be happy living with an old man who did n't understand me . I tried to cheer him up , and he made love to me , and before I knewp112it he 'd suggested that we elope and I 'd agreed . I do n't claim that it was n't exciting . It was  --  terribly . Grandfather had already left for town and everyone else was either out riding or playing golf . Bertie arranged everything while I was packing my bag  --  ' phoned Armonk , chartered a plane to take us to LaGuardia Field , and reserved two seats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of it was a real lark . The rest was n't so hot . " We got to Charleston a little after six and went right to the courthouse . I must say they make it awfully easy to get married in South Carolina . A fat old Judge Poindexter in a Panama hat fixed up the whole thing in eight minutes . It was only when he 'd pronounced us man and wife that I woke up . There I was  --  Mrs. Bertram Couter  --  when I did n't want to be at all ! I was getting awfully cold feet by that time and when Bertie proposed going to the Villa Rosa for the night I refused for fear I might meet someone I knew . That seemed to annoy him no end . He said we had to go somewhere and why not to the best ? We had dinner at a restaurant and when it came time to pay the check Bertie claimed he 'd given his last bill to the Judge . Then he suggestedwiring grandfather to send us enough money for our weddingtrip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive . I told him there was n't going to be any wedding trip  --  in fact that I was through . We had a fine old-fashioned row right there in the square and at the end of it I hopped in a taxi and took the next plane for New York . Luckily I had enough for my fare . I got back home before grandfather did , and without anyone knowing I 'd been away . " " And what became of  --  of  --  Bertie ? " " I have n't the remotest idea . I 've not laid eyes on him since . " " Or heard from him ? " " Only once . " She opened her bag . " He sent me this letter . "  | " The Chiltern Club " Dear Nancy : When you change your mind about announcing our marriage you can let me know at this address . Until then I shall respect your wishes . " Sincerely yours " BERTRAM C OUTER . " " And what do you expect me to do ? " asked Mr. Tutt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can be married next June . I do n't think Bertie will mind . " She leaned forward over the desk , her chin on her hands . " I know what you 're thinking , Uncle Eph . You 're wondering how anyone could have been so thoughtless and pleasure-loving as I was . I do n't blame you . But remember this took place six months before Pearl Harbor . All of our gang were going to parties and night clubs just as the other debutantes had always done . It could n't happen now . " The old man 's heart melted . These crazy kids ! He patted her cheek . " You must tell your grandfather , " he said . " Then I 'll have a talk with him . Run along now and let me think ! " Nancy threw her arms about his neck . " You 're such an old dear ! " she cried . " I knew you 'd be able to make everything all right . " His eyes followed her to the threshold . " Hold on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you happen to know where you could get tied so quickly ? Who suggested South Carolina ? " " Bertie , I guess . " " H 'm ! " Mr. Tutt caressed his chin . " Seemed to know all about it , did he ?  --  On the whole I think you 'd better bring this new one around for inspection . I might find a button missing . "  | At about the same hour that Nancy Baxter left the office of Tutt &; Tutt her legal husband awoke in his room overlooking Central Park at the Chiltern Club and rang for his breakfast . Having lost three hundred dollars in a rubber the night before he was in an even worse humor than usual . " Pay attention to what you 're doing when you draw my bath , " he rasped at Gogarty , the valet . " Have it exactly eighty degrees and put in plenty of salts . " " Yes , sir . Very good , sir ! " answered Gogarty with respect . Bertram Couter belonged to what will soon be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rich . " Until the outbreak of the war he had spent his time on house-parties , yachting cruises and private cars , in demand as an extra man on account of his small talk and skill at cards . Superficially he was rather an engagingperson , handsome and well built  --  if a little on the stout side  --  polished , debonair , and looking what he was , by Harvard out of the Social Register . Bertie was no Mike Romanoff , but the real thing ; and even those who suspected his motives and despisedhim as a sycophant were obliged to admit that he knew all the best people . The change in his fortunes had come as imperceptibly as the thinning of his sleek , black hair . He was still popular but with a difference , tolerated as socially useful , an avuncular companion to whom any mother could safely trust her daughter . A " debutante'sdelight " he kept his place on the stag line year after year questing circumspectly for a meal ticket . But , although as a glamour boy he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade to the night clubs that he never had to pay a check . It even gave him an advantage to have the girls refer to him as " dear Old Bertie . " Meantime his debts had piled up until he owed nearly tenp115thousand dollars , and since bridge was his only source of income his game had become sharper . As a boy he had fooled with card tricks . Now he dealt off the bottom when he was playing with old women or persons who had had too much to drink . No one suspected him ; he was a ranking member of the Bridge Club ; it was risky , but gentlemen must live . With the 1941 crop of debutantes Nancy swept into view . Twenty million dollars . He played his game adroitly , speaking of himself as an older man whom life had somehow cheated , and as one who had never been in love until now  --  when it was too late . Was it too late ? He could offer her something these college boys did not have  --  the mature adoration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He knew that she was not the least in love with him , but one could never tell what a woman would do . If she married him it would be on the spur of the moment , and he must be ready . The chance had come , oddly enough , when her old blunderbus of a grandfather had caught him dealing off the lower deck . Whew ! " Crook ! " " Card sharp ! " " Fortune hunter ! " Then Nancy had rushed indignantly to his defense and hair had flown all over the place . Magnanimously Bertie told her to forget it . No matter what suffering it cost him he 'd go away and never see her again  --  sacrifice his honor and all his hope of happiness for her sake ! He even imitated the famous Caruso sob in the larynx . Dear little girl ! Half an hour later they were flying to LaGuardia Field and he had wired Judge Poindexter , whose name he had found in the Legal Directory , to be ready to marry them . What happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was secure ; if the Commodore did n't want him for a son-in-law he could buy him off ; it would be a break for him either way.  |p116For  several months he had pondered the problem of how to turn his marriage to most advantage . Since the price he could extort for Nancy 's freedom would depend entirely on how much she wanted it , obviously the time to strike would be when she desired to remarry . He had no means of knowing when that would be , for naturally she would not announce her engagement to another unless and until she were first divorced . Now if he could delude Nancy into thinking that she was free to remarry , when in fact she was n't , and she should announce her engagementor  --  better still  --  actually remarry , he could name his own figure  --  perhaps as much as half a million dollars . In short , he planned to sell her a bad divorce first , and a good one afterwards  --  to make her pay twice for the same thing , the second at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew from superficial legal experience that the courts of New York refused to recognize as valid a Nevada divorce secured without service of papers upon the defendant within its boundaries . He had even read and made note of the case of a New York couple , a Mr. and Mrs. Williams , in which the latter , although she had taken up her residence in Reno for the time required by the Nevada statute and thereafter secured a decree of divorce , was nevertheless adjudged by the Court of Appeals at Albany to be still the wife of a defendant who had remained at home . There it was , printed in black and white : Divorced in Nevada , she was still married in New York . He had a lawyer friend upon whom he sponged occasionally for information and had received his assurance that such was the law . In any event , whatever he got for the bogus divorce would be pure velvet . When Nancy tried to remarry he could put on the screws . He almost wished he had been a lawyer . He liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cocatrice 's egg . "  |p117Mr  . Couter having read the paper including the daily bridge column , glanced at his engagement book , dressed leisurely , fanned a deck and tried a few passes , then strolled up the avenue to turn an honest penny with three elderly bridge-playing lady friends . His only worry was that his draft board might discover that he had not registered . Several of his friends had similarly neglected to do so and he figured that the chance of detection  --  owing to his migratory habits , the fact that he had no business , and that the club was his only address  --  was small . Even if they nipped him he could fake his age by a few years or pose as a conscientiousobjector . Anyhow it was a good gamble at worst . Bertie had no wish to go to war ; bath salts were much more to his liking . The roaring of Commodore Baxter when Mr. Tutt got him on the telephone was equalled only by a lion house at feeding time . " I 'd like to break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hudson . " Go easy on her , Horace ! " urged the old lawyer . " She 's just a child and a very lovely one . Dammit , you eloped yourself . She 's in a bad mess and she 's all you 've got . This may cost you real money . It looks as if Couter held all the cards . " " And deals ' em off the bottom ! " yelled the Commodore . " I have n't played poker all my life for nothing .  --  All right . Do n't badger me ! I 'll drop in tomorrow and we 'll talk things over . Meanwhile I 'll put that kid on short rations and send her to bed . " Mr. Tutt replaced the telephone with a grimace , then summonedhis partner Samuel Tutt , Miss Minerva Wiggin , his chief clerk , and Bonnie Doon , his general factotum.  --  " Bonnie , " he said when he had outlined the situation , " I want you to go up to the Chiltern Club and get the low-down on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pajamas and take the nextp118plane to Charleston , look up a marrying judge named Poindexter and find out whether this was really legal . Start right along , both of you ! Now Tutt , let 's go into committee of the whole . " Tutt patted his stomach complacently . " Anything about marriage and divorce , Mr. Tutt , " he remarkedafter they had gone , " is right up my alley . I 've had troubles of my own , you know . This smart guy must have looked up the law in advance and known exactly what he was doing . That 's why he went to South Carolina , the only state where a marriage is valid without notice . It 's all covered by a general statute  --  Civil Code 1930 , Sections 6J72 et seq .  --  and so long as the parties are over eighteen any officer authorized to administeran oath can legally marry them , with or without a license . Some law ! I think I am justified in the inference that , in the words of the great Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the phrase is , to rob a lady of her fortune by way of marriage . ' " " Not a doubt of it ! " agreed Mr. Tutt . " Our job is to imagine ourselves in Couter 's position , and decide how we 'd go about squeezing the Commodore for the largest possible sum in return for a divorce . " " And then out-think him ! " nodded his partner . " It 's a question of strategy , Mr. Tutt ! Strategy ! " They were still hard at it , surrounded by stogie smoke and law books , when Bonnie Doon returned two hours later . " It was easy ! " he remarked , waving aside one of the old man 's stogies in favor of a cigarette . " It just so happens that I know one of the valets up at the Chiltern , Mike Gogarty , so I waited until he went off duty and took him out for a couple of slugs . He 's worked for this guy seven years and hates his guts . Couter 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year in a Wall Street law firm and then went into a real estate officep119for a while . His real business is bridge . Mike says he 's not only one of the slickest players in town , but  --  and this is interesting  --  that in unpacking his valise not long ago he came on a couple of marked decks . Apparently Couter 's always chasing some rich skirt . To make a long story short I slipped my friend a ten spot and told him to split it with the girl who runs the club switchboard . She 's required to keep a list of all outgoing calls up there and  --  well , I thought it would be just as well to have a line on him . I 'll get the rest of his pedigree tomorrow . " They were no nearer a solution at closing time 4nd Mr. Tutt carried the problem home with him to his library on Twenty-third Street . All evening he sat in front of his sea-coal fire , smoking one stogie after another , playing an imaginary poker game in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten o'clock Miss Wiggintelephoned from Charleston that she had interviewed Judge Poindexter , that the marriage was legally iron-clad , and that she was taking a plane back to New York . Discouraged , the old man turned out the light and went to bed , where he tossed for hours , staring at the ceiling , testing out every possible move on Couter 's part . This was no poker game , but simply a bargain and sale . Couter would ask all the traffic could bear . Well , how would he decide what that was ? What one asked for a thing depended on how much the other fellow wanted it . Of course if Couter knew about Ranny Carter he 'd run the price up out of sight , but he had no idea of his existence . He could n't possibly know why Nancy wanted a divorce unless she actually announced her engagement to someone else , and she would n't do that until either she was legally free  --  or thought she was . Eureka ! Mr. Tutt kicked off the bedclothes and jumped out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one shot , but it might work . Everything would depend on the ability of Nancy and her grandfather to act a part.  |p120A  week later Mr. Couter found a letter in Nancy 's handwriting on his breakfast tray . " Tranquility Farm Rhinebeck-on-Hudson New York " Dear Bertram : I should like to see you as soon as convenient . Can you meet me in the Cocktail Lounge of the Croyon at half past three next Friday ? " Sincerely yours , " NANCY BAXTER . " Bertie was exultant at the success of his diplomacy . He had forced them to make the first move . It would n't be long now before he 'd be on Easy Street . He needed only two tricks for a grand slam , and while the first would be by far the hardest to take , he was bound to win in any case . God was in His Heaven , and the world was a little bit of all right . Elatedly Bertie dispatchedan answer to the effect that he would join Nancy at the place and time specified  --  with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lawyer who handles his own case is apt to have a fool for a client , but he had no wish to let one of the rapacious brotherhood horn in for a fat cut . So when his legal friend had warned him on the telephone : " I suppose you know that divorce law is fairly complicated , Couter , " he had answered rather curtly : " Thanks . Yes , I know . " Now as he sauntered up Park Avenue that winter afternoon the world looked very much his oyster . For one foolish second he even fancied that Nancy might have decided to stay married to him after all . Why not ? She could do worse . No , in that case she would n't have waited for over six months . She was certainly planning to ask him for a divorce . And she should have it  --  a good one if she 'd pay the price , a phony if she wouldn't.  |p12IFor  such an early hour there seemed to be a lot of people in the Croyon lounge , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd . At a nearby table a seedy old guy in a rusty frock coat and black string tie was pulling on a rat-tailed stogie and chatting with a smart-looking West Pointer , while at another a pretty , middle-aged woman was talking to a flashy chap in a mail-order suit . The Croyon must be slipping ! And then he saw Nancy in the smart gray uniform of the Red Cross motor corps waving to him from a distant corner . She certainly was a pippin ! " Hello , my dear ! " he said , pulling out the chair opposite . " Well , here 's old Bertie ! " They shook hands over the flower basket . " What 'll you have , moppet ? " " Just milk . If I took anything stronger I 'd be shot at sun-rise . " Bertie ordered a pint of Grade A and a real drink for himself . He could see that the meeting was going to be a success , but Nancy looked so lovely that his satisfaction was clouded by the thought of giving her up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you so abruptly in Charleston ! " she said anxiously . " It was pretty raw ! " " You certainly made a fool of me ! " he agreed ruefully . " I 'm awfully sorry ! But honestly , Bertie , it was the only thing I could do once I realized what a mistake it was . " " Are you quite sure that it was a mistake ? " " Perfectly . That 's what I want to see you about . Things ca n't go on like this . It is n't fair to either of us . " " If you want a divorce , it 's Okay by me , " he said valiantly . " Your happiness is all I care about . " " How sweet of you , Bertie ! Do you suppose we could be divorced without anyone knowing that we 'd ever been mar-ried ? "  |p122Bertie  explained that if she went out to Reno and kept more or less under cover , there would be an excellent chance of escaping any publicity whatever , since the proceedings would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did leak out , what difference would it make ? Everyone got divorced these days . He even offered tentatively to arrange the legal end of it and retain counsel for her . Nancy declaring that it was awfully kind of him accepted his suggestion with gratitude . She did n't know any lawyers and it would be a great relief to have him attend to everything . She 'd do exactly as he said . Candy from a child ! It was only at the very end , just as she rose to go , that Bertie hinted delicately that since he was painfully in the red he would have to ask her to meet the necessary expenses . " Why , of course , " she responded . " If I 'm to get the divorce 1 could n't expect you to pay for it ! I 'm sure , when I tell grandfatherwhat we plan to do , he 'll be so pleased that he 'll want to help your personally in some way . How much do you owe ? " Bertie , as if to hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I need about ten thousand , " he admitted modestly  --  right into the dictaphone concealed there . " Only ten thousand ? He 'll certainly be willing to lend you that much ! " she said . They parted like old friends . Bertie had another cocktail , and strolled out past Mr. Tutt , on top of the world . Nancy telephoned later that she had already told her grandfather of her escapade and that while , quite naturally , he had at first been rather angry he was so pleased about the proposed divorce that he had agreed to everything including ten thousand dollars " legal expenses . " Would Bertie be good enough to call at the office of the Baxter Mercantile Marine Company in the Whitehall Building next day and fix things up ?  |p123Couter  found the Commodore in a big airy room lined with ship models overlooking the upper harbor . The old boy had clearly made up his mind to let bygones be bygones . " Come in ! Come in ! " he bellowed , pushing a cigar box towardBertie . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very decent of you to make things so easy for Nancy . Of course it was a mistake , but after all no harm has been done . All the same , one of those fortunehuntingfellows might have stood me up for God only knows how much .  --  Now about that ten thousand . Damned if I see how I can cover it up on our books . You know those Scotch accountants ! Everlastingly nosy fellows ! And then there 's the gift tax , and all sorts of other complications . It would be a lot simpler for me if , instead of drawing a check , I could put you on our payroll as local agent for the company at a thousand a month somewhere  --  sayat Palm Beach . Your duties would be purely nominal . Otherwise I 'll be stumped . " The proposition struck Bertie as a godsend . He had failed of his customary invitation to Palm Beach that winter , and this would give him a chance both to escape his creditors and to hide out from the draft . They would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he came back and collected on his grand slam . he could change his name and start traveling again  --  go " rolling down to Rio " and maybe buy a cattle ranch . He pictured himself a Spanish gentleman with vast estates , riding over the pampas in dashing costume on his horse  --  only he did n't like horses , he was better at the rumba . Anyhow , he 'd go to Palm Beach first . " I 'll be glad to help you , Commodore , " he smiled . " When shall I start ? " " Anytime . " His grandfather-in-law glanced at the calendar and reached for the company check book . " Suppose we pay you a month 's salary in advance and you takep124over next Monday ? " He shoved a printed sheet across the desk . " For your own protection you 'd better have a contract . I might pop off unexpectedly you know . Just put your John Hancock opposite the cross . " The contract was both short and simple and Bertie signed . " There you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the check . " Do n't break your heart over Nancy . Marry in haste and repent at leisure , ' you know . " So Bertie went off to Florida , and Nancy confidingly placed herself in the hands of his lawyer friend who shipped her off to Reno and , through his correspondents there , commenced a divorceaction against Couter , service being made , under the Nevada law , by publication only and without personal appearanceby the defendant . The required six weeks period of residence having ended she received her decree , good in Nevada or in any State willing to recognize it , but not in New York . Mr. Couter , glancing over the New York paper at the EvergladesClub on Washington 's Birthday , stumbled upon a social item : " Commodore Horatio Baxter of Rhinebeck-on-Hudson and Park Avenue announces the engagement of his granddaughter Miss Nancy Baxter to Cadet Randolph Carter . The wedding will take place at West Point upon June 12th next . " The trap had fallen . He had ' cm ! Promptly he resigned his position and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad to go . His friends at Palm Beach had not paid much attention to him and it was a relief to be back in his old room at the Chiltern , waited on by the respectful and attentive Gogarty . Everything had gone according to Hoyle  --  was as good as in the bag . He must be brave as a lion , gentle as a dove  --  " fortiter in re , suaviter in modo. "  | " Chiltern Club " Dear Nancy : I have read with interest the announcement of your engagement to Mr. Carter and extend to you my heartiest congratulations . Before making further plans it might be well for you to confer with me about our divorce . I have reason to believe that a slight mistake has been made , but one which can be easily rectified . " Sincerely yours , " BERTRAM COUTER . " Her response was immediate : " 1040 Park Avenue " Dear Bertie : Thank you so much for your kind note . I shall be glad to see you here next Friday afternoon at three o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seemed to Bertie as if the elevator would never reach the penthouse . He could not help being a bit nervous  --  he had never done anything like this before , but he assured himself that he could not lose . He was still Nancy 's lawful husband in the State of New York and he was willing to remain so . All he had to do was to sit tight until they raised the ante to his figure . He had expected to find her alone , but when the butler admitted him to the Baxter apartment he was greeted by the odor of cigars and the sound of laughter . " This way , sir , please . " Bertie was disconcerted to find four people seated about the table in the dining room . " Come in , Couter ! Glad to see you ! " cried the Commodore . " I do n't have to introduce you to my granddaughter . This is her fiance , Mr. Carter , and an old friend of mine , Mr. Ephraim Tutt . Sit down and have a drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to notice that none of them had arisen to greet him . Was n't thatp126the same old guy he 'd noticed in the Croyon ? What could he be doing here ? " Thanks . Whiskey , please , " he said to the butler . " Sorry you deserted us , " continued his former employer . " Did n't you like Palm Beach ? " " I found Florida a good deal changed , " Bertie conceded . " I 've just been telling Mr. Carter and Mr. Tutt how decent you were about letting Nancy get her divorce . I must say you 've acted in a most understanding fashion . " " Most understanding , " agreed Mr. Tutt . " Remarkably so ! " " Indeed , yes ! " echoed Ranny Carter . " Bertie always was wonderful at planning things ahead , " remarkedNancy , who somehow appeared much more mature than when he had last seen her . " We really are greatly indebted to you , Couter ! " declared the Commodore . " By gad ! We ought to drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was getting harder for Bertie every minute . He did n't know how to begin . They were so damned unsuspecting .  --  Suaviter inmodo ! " I 'm  --  I 'm a little worried about our divorce , " he stammered . " A friend of mine happened to mention to me that , unless the defendant was served within the boundaries of Nevada , a Reno divorce is n't good in New York . I did n't appear , you know . I hope that wo n't invalidate the decree ! " The old guy in the frock coat exhaled a gray cloud of stogie smoke in Baxter 's direction . " Mr. Couter 's statement of the law is absolutely correct , " he said , " and it is most thoughtful of him to warn us . But divorce law is rather tricky . In fact , many lawyers have never heard of the so-called Special New York Rule ' Mr. Couter refers to . Luckily it does not apply to this case . "  | " I recall your saying so , Eph , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an air of innocence . " But I 've forgottenjust why . " Bertie went suddenly queasy . Could the Commodore have put something over on him ? Impossible ! " It 's quite simple , " said Mr. Tutt . " On the one hand any state is , of course , free to grant a divorce on whatever terms it sees fit , which will be valid within its own jurisdiction and in such states as choose to recognize it ; but , on the other , the SupremeCourt at Washington has held that the State of New York is not obliged under the full faith and credence ' clause to recognize a decree of divorce granted in a foreign state where there was no appearance of , or personal service upon , the defendant in the suit . The point , however , is this . While this state does refuse to recognize such a decree , when the defendant was a resident of New York at the time the foreign suit was begun and the decree was rendered , it will not extend its protection to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in favor of its own citizens . " " But I am a citizen ! " protested Bertie excitedly . " I 've been a resident of New York State for twenty years ! " " Not when Nancy began her divorce action in Nevada , " repliedMr . Tutt taking a paper from his pocket . " At that time you had become a resident of Florida . Here 's how your contract reads : The Baxter Mercantile Marine Co. , party of the first part , agrees to employ Bertram Couter , party of the second part , as its resident agent in Palm Beach , Florida , for the period of one year at a salary of one thousand dollars per month payable in advance ; the said party of the second part '  --  that 's you , Mr. Couter  --  ' promises to devote his entire time to the furtherance of the company 's business in the State of Florida of which State he guarantees himself to be a legal resident . ' Your anxiety , howeverp128much it does you credit , is quite unnecessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bertie felt as if he had received a heavy kick in his gastrointestinaltract , but he did his best to appear composed  --  " Fortiter in re ! " " There was another thing that worried me , " he said . " Speaking frankly and calling a spade a spade , this was a collusive divorce . You paid me for it . If someone should raise the question the court might declare it invalid and then where would you be ? " " Do n't bother about that ! " replied Mr. Tutt . " The law will not permit a party to a collusive divorce to attack it . That was all hashed out in Kaufman versus Kaufman , 177 App . Div. 162 . He is , as we say , estopped . ' Nancy has nothing whatever to fear , Mr. Couter . " Bertie , with a forced smile , gazed at the circle of amused faces . The butler was filling the champagne glasses . " Thanks for your interest , Couter . Here 's to your future ! " Perspiration beaded Bertie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him now ? He had n't got enough out of it even to pay his debts . Their faces merged into a mocking grin . To hell with " fortiter in re " ! Why make any more pretenses ? " Do n't you think I ought to be taken care of in some way ? " he whined . " Just a few thousand ? " Ranny Carter stood up . " I 'll take care of you , you rat ! " he cried . " Hold back , Ranny ! " warned the Commodore , as he pressed a bell . " Uncle Sam will do that for you .  --  Tell the officer to come in , Morton . " A police lieutenant entered and Bertie sprang to his feet lookingwildly toward the windows . Twenty-seven stories ! " I 've got a warrant for a draft dodger named Couter , " he said . " Which is he ? "  |p129THE  launch slithered through the reeds and grounded beneath a low bluff . Mr. Tutt looked helplessly about him at the vast salt marshes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swept like ghostly caravels . Overhead , a turkey buzzard lazily etched wide circles in the aqueous blue . " Any idea where we are ? " he inquired of the Negro boatman . Uncle Ezra grinned disarmingly . " Ise sho kind o ' perplexed dis minute ! " he admitted . The old lawyer , who had stopped over at Savannah on his way back from Florida , to see his friend , Judge Culpepper , now living in retirement on a small coastal plantation , had been captivated by the beautiful city with its spacious squares embowered by magnolia trees in full flower , bordered by pink azaleas and lined by stately dwellings whose peeling stucco made soft splashes of color amid the bright green foliage . In answer to the judge 's suggestion that he take a trip downriver through the inland waterways and spend a night at his bungalow , he had promptly packed his bag and hired a motorboat with an antique darky , who swore he knew Jedge Culpepper well , yussuh , an ' zackly where his plantation come down to de ribber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were lost . " I do n't want to be marooned here all night , " he said . " You stay here , Ezra , while I go and explore . " Mr. Tutt , forcing his way through the tangled growth to the higher ground , found himself in a shadowy forest carpeted with ivy and myrtle interspersed with violets . Beyond a glade containing the crumbling remains of walls he stumbled upon a cart road ,  | which presently merged into a neglected , grass-grown driveway lined with palms and palmettos , and leading to a big old-fashioneddwelling . He stopped , entranced . He had often seen , in the Sunday supplements , rotogravure pictures of Southern mansions of brick or stone , with huge pillars supporting massive pediments and surrounded by towering hedges of box or thick bushes of jasmine . This old wooden house resembled them not at all . It seemed like a part of the forest itself , as if it had grown there . Three stories in height , rectangular and rambling , there was nothing pretentious about its double row of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fluted columnsupholding them . Its color , which had once been white , was now more nearly gray , and the shutters a faded aquamarine . Even the big chimneys had weathered to a dull sienna . The house rested there rather than stood , comfortable , dignified and reserved  --  a Georgia home . Surrounded by giant live oaks , their branches dripping with gray moss , with the balconies and pillars festooned by wistaria , it was like the face of a kindly old ghost half hidden in a diaphanous , swaying veil of mist . Mr. Tutt stole nearer , unwilling to break its spell . And now he noticed that around the roof ran an exquisitely carved cornice , and that each window sill and lintel , together with the classic portal , was similarly adorned . In front , the driveway ended in a pebbled courtyard centering about a moss-grown pool , from which radiated long nave-like allees which lost themselves in the forest . Some skillful architect of Jefferson 's time had been given carte blanche and done his best . Mr. Tutt ascended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door was open and he could look into a high wainscoted hall ending in double spiral staircases . He pressed the bell , but there was no response . Was nobody home ? Then he glimpsed , peeringp131at him like a pixie from behind a tree trunk , a small black face , which instantly vanished . There must be someone . He walked around the house to a rose garden hedged with box and fragrant with rosemary , thyme and marjoram . A fountain trickled in a green niche where a pretty girl with delicate , straight features and ash-blond hair lay reading on a wicker couch . At the sound of his footsteps she jumped to her feet . " Oh , Hugh ! I 'm so glad  --  " Then , seeing who it was , her expression changed to disappointment . " I thought it was Mr. Langhorne ! " she explained . " Pardon my intrusion , " said the lawyer , " but I have lost my way . My name is Tutt  --  Ephraim Tutt . I am trying to find my friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He lives almost next door . I 'm Elsie Beaufort . Judge Culpepper is one of my oldest friends . " " And one of mine also . " They stood for a moment smiling at each other . " Wo n't you sit down ? " she asked . " I wish I could , but I am late already . How far is it to Judge Culpepper 's place ? " " About half a mile by water . He lives just beyond the nextpoint . You can reach it through the woods in ten minutes . " " My bag is in the launch . I 'm afraid I must be getting on . " " Then I 'll show you the way to the shore . I wish you couldstay longer . " He glanced about him . " You live in a beautiful place . " A shadow crossed her face . " Yes , is n't it lovely ? Beaulieu has been in our family for eight generations . George the Second granted it to William Beaufort , who came over with Oglethorpein 1733 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Ezra was waiting.  | " That 's the old fort built for defense against the Indians and the Spaniards , " she said , pointing to the ruined walls . " It 's made of tabby  --  beach sand , oyster shells and lime , you know . It lasts forever . When the men were away on their expeditions , the women on the plantation used to move down here . Once they held it for weeks against the Spaniards until the men came back . " Mr. Tutt gazed out over the boundless sea of waving grass , with a sense of bodily release . " Somehow my soul seems suddenly freeFrom the weighing of fate and the sad discussion of sin , By the length and the breadth and the sweep of the marshes of Glynn , " he quoted from Sidney Lanier . " I am glad to have seen Beaulieu and to have met you , Miss Beaufort . Good-by . " " Good-by , sir . " He noted that she did not invite him to come again . Miss Beaufort waited on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress tightly about her firm slim figure , until the launch was lost to view . The queer old man in his rusty frock coat and stovepipe hat had inspired her instant confidence . Somehowshe felt that in his departure she had lost a friend  --  as now she was going to lose her beloved Beaulieu . With a sigh she turned back , following the half-obliterated road past the former slave quarters along the shore . She had almost reached its juncture with the circle in front of the house when two strangers carrying surveying instruments came out of the woods . Coincidently , she observed a motorcar parked among the bushes . Her worst fears were confirmed . The presence of these men must have some connection with the threat to Beaulieu . Hasteningher steps , she overtook them before they could climb in.  | " This is private property , " she said . " What are you doing here ? " The taller , a sallow man with a jimberjaw , paused with his foot on the running board . " Just takin ' a look around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is allowed to pass the gatehouse without permission . You 're trespassing . Go away at once . " The stranger slowly removed his foot and faced her . " Do n't get excited , young lady . I 'll go when I 'm good and ready  --  not before . " Just then an open motorcar whirled up the drive into the circle before the house . In it were a husky khaki-clad youth wearing sergeant 's stripes , and a slender , red-faced old gentleman with silver hair and goatee . " Hugh ! " called Elsie . " Come here ! I found this man trespassingand he refuses to leave ! " In answer , the young man leaped out and ran toward them . " Get out of here ! " he ordered . " Get moving ! " " Better be careful ! " returned the stranger threateningly . " I 'm Frank Upsher . Another month and I 'll be ordering you off ! " The soldier seized the man by the opening of his jacket , backed him against the side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell off . " I 've been hoping to meet you , Mr. Upsher ! " he said , twistinghis collar until he was purple in the face . " It 's a pleasure ! " " I 'll make you pay for this ! " choked Upsher , struggling to free himself . " I own this place ! " His companion , who obviously did not enjoy his part in the affair , had already climbed in and started the engine . " You . . . own . . . this . . . place , do you ? " Hugh lifted him by his collar and toppled him head over heels into the car , which started amid a whirl of dead magnolia leaves . " If I findp134you here again I 'll thrash you within an inch of your life ! " he declared , tossing the hat after its owner . His grandfather had been an enthusiastic observer of the episode . " Good work , Hugh ! " he yelled , dancing up and down and pulling his goatee in excitement . " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Judge Culpepper , in overalls , was fishing on the end of his little dock when Mr. Tutt hove in sight . Beside him stood two tall glasses and a white porcelain pitcher from which protruded a green bouquet . He was a big flabby man with a face so like a baby 's that his corncob pipe had the effect of a startling anachronism . " Where the heck have you been , Eph ? " he grunted as the launch ran up alongside . " It 's after sunset . I sure thought you were lost . " " I was , " answered his friend , " but I do n't regret it . " " Anyhow , you 're just in time for a julep , " answered the judge , helping Mr. Tutt up the ladder . " And after that I 'll show you over my domain . . . . Tote that valise up to the house , Ezra . " The moon rose over the marshes while the two old friends sat on the veranda of Judge Culpepper 's bungalow . Behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You have a charming neighbor in Miss Beaufort , " remarked Mr. Tutt . " She lives in a most romantic spot . " " You 're right ! Elsie 's the prettiest girl and Beaulieu the finest plantation in Chatham County , " heartily agreed the judge . " She and her young brother are the last of their line . Her father died two years ago and she 's been more than a mother to the boy ever since . She 's got him at the Virginia Military Institute atp135present . Tom Beaufort was one of the aristocrats of Savannah and its most prosperous cotton factor . He was very proud of Beaulieu 's twelve hundred acres and , while his money lasted , kept ' em up in princely fashion . Then the bottom dropped out of the market and he became as poor as the rest of us . Bit by bit he had to sell off his land , until he had only the mansion house and some three hundred acres left . Then he put a **34;550;TOOLONG on that too . The irony of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd have been a very wealthy man again . " " How so ? " " He had a friend , Kreck , a kind of crackpot inventor . Nobody else took any stock in him , but Tom , who was a big-hearted chap , used to give him money to keep him going . Three years before he died , Kreck persuaded Beaufort , just when his fortunes were at their lowest ebb , to put twenty-five thousand dollars into a scheme for improving the tips of airplane wings , on the understanding that he was to have half the profits . That 's why Tom mortgaged Beaulieu . Well , to everyone 's surprise , it was a big success . Kreck built a factory , and they began to coin money hand over fist . But it did n't do either of ' em any good . They both died within six weeks of each other . " " In that case , why did n't Miss Beaufort and her brother inherittheir father 's interest in the business ? " " That 's the tough part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend never drew up any papers , and the factory was run as if it were Kreck 's private business . They never declared a dividend and the books do n't show anything . " " But there must be plenty of people who know it was a part-nership . " " Everyone in Savannah , but no one can prove it except Elsie , and under our code she is n't allowed to testify . All we 've got isp136Tom 's **27;586;TOOLONG check , which Kreck cashed . A no-good half brother of his , named Upsher , turned up here from St. Louis , had himself appointed administrator and is goingto get everything . Elsie had no money to employ an attorney , so , to help her out , I volunteered my services , and , on the basis of the check , filed a claim against Upsher as Kreck 's representative , which he promptly disallowed . I 've taken the case to our Superior Court . It comes up day after tomorrow , but it 's just a bluff . Storrow , Upsher 's lawyer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of it is that Upsher , besides buying up all the land he can get around here , has taken over the mortgage himself and will get possession of Beaulieu by foreclosure . If only she could establish her claim against Upsher , it would wipe out the mortgage . It 's a travesty on justice ! " " Why has n't such a lovely girl married long ago ? " " She would have but for the war . She 's engaged to an excellent young fellow , Hugh Langhorne , old General Langhorne 's grandson . They were to be married this month , and Hugh had plans all worked out for restoring the land and putting Beaulieu back on a paying basis . Then he was drafted and everything had to be put off because Hugh , whose parents died when he was a child , has n't a cent of money , and the general , while something of a swell , is next door to being a public charge . He 's a choleric old guy , and a bit screwy when he gets excited . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've worried myself sick over the case . " " You say that all that stands between Miss Beaufort and her rights is some local law ? " " Yes ; what we call the Dead Man 's Statute  --  same as you have in New York . " " Got it handy ? " " There 's a copy of it in my study . "  |p137Judge  Culpepper went inside and returned with a copy of the Georgia code . " It 's Subdivision 1 of Section 38-1603 . When any suit shall be defended by the personal representative of a deceased person , the opposite party shall not be admitted to testify in his own favor as to transactions or communications with such deceased person . ' You see , it 's ironclad ! Under our law , the only way a party interested in the result of a case against an estate can testify to a conversation or a transaction with a deceased is when the lawyer for the estate has himself first called a witness to it . The law may be all right in general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish I 'd never volunteered my services . I shall look like a fool and shall probably get the blame for the loss of the case . " Mr. Tutt took the volume and re-read the section , pulling thoughtfully on his stogie . A heron croaked somewhere in the dim immensity of the marsh . " This Upsher  --  the next of kin  --  what sort of a fellow is he ? " " Cold as a fish ! " " Does n't care what people think of him : ' " Not a damn ! " " How about his lawyer  --  Storrow , I think you said his name was ? " " Storrow ? He 's not so bad , although he 's rather second-rate . A kind of social climber , but he has n't got very far . " " One who has his way to make and wants to stand in with the right sort of people in Savannah ? " " Decidedly . What difference does that make ? " " It may make a lot , " mused Mr. Tutt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , Josh ? " " Indeed I do ! " " Would you be willing to take me on as associate counsel ? " " It would lift a ton of brick off my chest . "  | " Then let 's walk over through the woods to Beaulieu and have a chat with Miss Beaufort . It 's moonlight . " " I 'll get my lantern , " said Judge Culpepper . Elsie was playing chess with General Langhorne while Hugh read a magazine in the corner , when Mr. Tutt and Judge Culpeppercame in . " How nice to see you again ! " she exclaimed . " Let me present General Langhorne , Mr. Tutt , and my fiance , Sergeant Lang-horne . " Hugh shook hands cordially with the old lawyer , but the general , who had just lost a bishop , clearly did not share her pleasure . " How do you do , suh , " he said stiffly , adding with obvious suspicion , " Are you from the No'th , suh ? " " Mr. Tutt is a well-known member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 've told him the fix we 're in , and he has kindly offered to assist me in prosecuting Elsie 's claim without  --  needlessto say  --  any financial compensation . " The general drew himself up . " With your long experience upon the bench , Judge Culpepper , I fail to see why you need the assistance of a stranger , suh ! " " Mr. Tutt is n't a stranger , " protested Elsie . " He 's one of Uncle Josh 's oldest friends . They went to college together . " " The presence of a No'therner might prejudice our case , " asserted the general . " Grandfather ! " laughed Hugh . " The War Between the States is over . " " Lee should never have surrendered ! " cried the old gentleman , jerking at his goatee . " One would think he 'd led Pickett 's charge , " commented Hugh . " In point of fact , grandfather was n't born until 1866 . Certainly it 's most kind of Mr. Tutt to offer his services . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old lawyer to a chair beside her . " What do you think of our chances ? " In the candlelight , with her ash-blond hair and brown eyes , and surrounded by the portraits of her ancestors , she looked even lovelier than in the garden . " It 's one of those cases where the letter of the law is on one side and justice on the other . If we could devise some means whereby you might be permitted to testify in spite of the code 's prohibition , of course you 'd win hands down . No jury would hesitate for an instant . It 's really a fantastic situation . Your father mortgages Beaulieu in order to raise twenty-five thousand dollars for his friend Kreck , and after the latter 's death , his next of kin not only seeks to evade repayment but takes over and starts foreclosure of the very mortgage by means of which Kreck was able to make a fortune . No honest man would do such a thing , nor would anyone who cared tuppence for the good opinion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to waive the statute . " " He never will ! " declared Judge Culpepper . " Certainly not after what happened this afternoon , " agreed Hugh . " I nearly choked him to death . " He briefly recounted what had occurred . " In a desperate case I 'm inclined to advise taking desperate chances , " declared Mr. Tutt . " It may work and it may not . Anyhow , you 've nothing to lose . " " What do you propose , sir ? " asked Hugh . " Mislead the enemy as to our real intentions , in the hope that we can outflank him . " " In other words , shenanigan ! " burst out General Langhorne , who had been silently nursing his resentment . " Such tactics are unworthy of the Beauforts ! " " I do n't care whether it 's shenanigan or whether it is n't , so long as we save Beaulieu , " answered Elsie . " What can we do ? " " What I suggest may seem to you ill-advised , even suicidal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defense a letter such as I shall dictate . " Elsie seated herself at a near-by Queen Anne table , Hugh fetched paper and ink , and she poised her pen . " All ready . Do n't go too fast . " Mr. Tutt dictated : Beaulieu , June 17 , 1941 . Dear Mr. Storroze : Pardon this appeal to your generosity . AlthoughI have brought an action against Mr. Kreck 's estate based on my father 's check for twenty-five thousand dollars , I can not prove that it was not merely a gift or a repayment of money previouslyadvanced . I started it hoping you might settle for enough to relieve me from my present financial embarrassment . Could you not , if necessary , strain your conscience , for the sake of the old friendship between Mr. Kreck and my father , to give me something ? It would mean so much to me . Of course my offer is confidential and without prejudice . Sincerely yours , ELSIE BEAUFORT . General Langhorne had leaped to his feet , his goatee vibrating with fury . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking his fist at Mr. Tutt , " you sha n't put my future granddaughter-in-law in such a humiliatingposition ! I wo n't have any damned Yankee coming down here and interfering in our affairs ! " " Grandfather , " cried Elsie in distress , " Mr. Tutt is our guest . " The general flushed . " Miss Beaufort is right . I apologize , suit . But if you send that letter , it will be against my advice and withoutmy consent . I wash my hands of the whole business ! " He stalked out.  | " I do n't know that I blame him , " said Judge Culpepper . " It certainly looks crazy . However , I 've brought Mr. Tutt into the case , and if you trust him --  " I do trust him ! " replied Elsie . " I feel sure that he wants to save Beaulieu almost as much as ourselves , and I 'm ready to do anything he says . . . . Do n't you feel the same way , Hugh ? " There was a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That letter appears to be an absolute abandonment of Miss Beaufort 's claim . " He hesitated . " I ca n't imagine what its purpose can be . " " You will note that it is marked without prejudice , ' " answered the lawyer . " It will be , I confess , an arrow shot in the dark , but it may find its mark . " " Well , " said Hugh finally , " I do n't see how matters could be any worse . So long as Elsie is satisfied , I am willing to leave the matter in your hands . " " If you decide to send the letter , " said Mr. Tutt as he arose to take his leave , " there is one thing I would ask you to do . See that as many persons as possible whose good opinion Mr. Storrow values are present at the trial . Good night . " As Elsie watched their lantern bobbing through the tree trunks her heart failed her a little . Could Grandpa Langhorne have been right ? What did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bed , unable to sleep , while the moon sank lower through the live oaks , her doubts increased . Who was this Mr. Tutt ? Why should she have such confidence in his honesty and wisdom ? Suddenly she became aware that the mockingbirds had ceased their singing . An unearthly silence had descended upon Beaulieu , yet the night seemed to palpitate with muffled voices . She went to the window and looked out into the garden . In the faint moonlightit seemed thronged with the ghostly presences of her fore- bears  --  Lord Cecil Beaufort , comrade of Oglethorpe , in embroideredcoat and small clothes ; General George Beaufort , friend of Washington and Pulaski , in the buff-and-blue uniform of the Revolution , his sword swinging soundlessly from his belt ; Admiral John Beaufort , who had fought the Tripolitan pirates with Decatur ; Colonel Carter Beaufort , in the costume of a Confederatecavalry officer ; and beside him Major Stanton Beaufort , who had died in the Bloody Angle at Spotsylvania ; Chief Justice Beaufort of the state Supreme Court ; Dick Beaufort , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beaufort , her grandfather , who had fallen at the Marne . And who was that shadowy figure in khaki behind them ? Could it be Hugh ? Silently they grouped themselves , the guardians of Beaulieu , as from the other end of the garden another and so different figure came toward them  --  a tall , ramshackly old man in a frock coat and stovepipe hat . They raised their arms in salutation ; then , one by one , each shook him by the hand . Lawyer Storrow did not relish the position in which he found himself , owing to the Beaufort case . He had practiced in Savannahonly five years , he was socially ambitious , with two daughters whom he was eager to introduce to the drawing rooms of Bull and Drayton streets , and he was on the waiting list of the OglethorpeClub . He had undertaken to represent Upsher as administratorof the Kreck estate simply because it had looked like profitable business , but he had soon regretted it , for during the past weeks he had been visited by a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he interpose a purely technical obstacle to the legal recognition of Miss Beaufort'sclaim , he would jeopardize not only their good opinion but his professional career as well . Hence , on receiving Elsie 's letter , his relief was intense . Nop143longer could there be any basis for the assertion that the statute would work an injustice . Here was the girl 's own admission that her claim was baseless . Triumphantly he called his client on the telephone . " Great news , Upsher ! That Beaufort girl has written me a letter admitting that her suit is all a bluff and offering to settle practically on our terms ! What shall I do ? " " Do n't give her a cent ! " replied Upsher . " I 'm going to teach her and that upstart lover of hers a lesson ! " When Judge Peyton Lamar ascended the bench of the Superior Court room on the morning of the trial , he found it filled with his fellow townsfolk , who had known Tom Beaufort and had come to give his daughter their moral support and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fettle , sat Counselor Storrow with his unpleasant-looking client , unable to comprehend why the case should be tried , and momentarily expectingJudge Culpepper to arise and consent to its discontinuance . Nothing of the sort occurred , however , and almost before they realized it , a jury had been impaneled and Mr. Tutt arose to open the case . " Gentlemen of the jury , " he said quietly , " this is an action brought by Miss Elsie Beaufort , as administratrix of her father , Thomas Beaufort , for twenty-five thousand dollars , against the estate of Eben Kreck , deceased . She will be my only witness , since she is the sole person now alive who can testify to the circumstancessurrounding the transaction . . . . Miss Beaufort , please take the stand . " Upsher and Storrow exchanged grins . Even the girl herself , with all her faith in Mr. Tutt , wondered what he could be up to . Suppose Judge Culpepper had been wrong about him , and that he was , in fact , just a senile old blunderer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the **27;615;TOOLONG check . " Is that your father 's signature ? " he asked , when she had been sworn . " It is , " she replied . " We have no objection to the check going in evidence , " announcedMr . Storrow with an air of magnanimity . " We concede that it was cashed by the decedent , Eben Kreck , whose endorsementit bears . " " Then tell his honor and the jury the circumstances under which this check was delivered and what was said by your father and Mr. Kreck . " Instantly Storrow was on his feet . " Oh , no ! " he cried . " Her testimony is expressly excluded under Section 38-1603 of our code . " A murmur of disapproval came from the benches . " In that case , I desire to make an offer of proof , " insisted Mr. Tutt . " I wish to establish by this witness that for three years before Eben Kreck died he was constantly at Beaulieu , urging her father to raise enough money to perfect an invention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that Mr. Kreck claimed there was millions in it and that while , if obliged to do so , he could secure the necessary backing from Wall Street bankers , he preferred to have Mr. Beaufort , who had been his friend and benefactor , share in his good fortune ; that he agreed , if Beaufort would let him have twenty-five thousand dollars , they would be partners in the business , sharing equally in all the profits , and call it The Kreck Manufacturing Company ; that Beaufort thereupon placed a mortgage on Beaulieu and gave Kreck the check now in evidence ; that the enterprise was surprisingly successful , all the early profits being put back into it to expand the plant ; that the partners held weekly conferences at which thisp145witness was present , and on some occasions discussed the desirabilityof declaring dividends or dividing a portion of the profits ; that while no papers or memoranda of agreement were found among the papers of either after their deaths , they always spoke of the business as a partnership in which Miss Beaufort 's father put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " We object ! " repeated Storrow . " The objection is sustained , " ruled judge Lamar . " In the absence of other evidence , the law must presume that this check represents a gift or the payment of an antecedent debt . " Mr. Tutt straighted his tall form . " If the Court please , " he said , " while that may be the law , the administrator may waive it , and in this instance , if he were a man of honor , he would do so . It is inconceivable that Mr. Thomas Beaufort should have owed a penniless inventor money or that , in his own financially crippled condition , he would have mortgaged his family estate simply to make him a gift . On its face , the transaction points to a joint enterprise , as this witness can prove . We are here to get at the truth . Is this half-brother of the decedent , who not only refuses to recognize an honest debt but has himself taken over and is about to foreclose the very mortgage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hide behind the technicality of a statute ? " Mr. Storrow flushed uncomfortably . Unless he made use of Elsie 's letter , which would serve as a complete vindication , he saw himself a social outcast in Savannah for the rest of his life . " I am only acting as an attorney , " he expostulated . " The statuteis perfectly clear . It was wisely enacted by our legislature to protect estates against the claims of unscrupulous persons who would otherwise be free to testify to imaginary conversations or transactions with those whose lips are sealed by death . I -- He was interrupted by General Langhorne.  | " If you are referring to Miss Beaufort , suh , " he shouted wrathfully , " I shall hold you to strict account for your words ! " Judge Lamar tapped with his gavel . " Please resume your seat , General Langhorne . I feel sure that Mr. Storrow 's remarks had no personal application . The statute has a laudable purpose , even if it may occasionally work injus-tice . " " Of course I was not referring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have , in fact , the highest regard for her honesty . " He fumbled in the breast pocket of his Prince Albert . What if the letter had been marked confidential ? He must exculpate himself . " My client 's refusal to waive his rights under the statute and my own course in objecting to her claim are fully justified by her own statements in writing . " Mr. Tutt 's heart leaped as Storrow produced the letter . The trout had risen to his fly . " Miss Beaufort , " said Storrow with solemn emphasis , " did you not only yesterday send me a letter ? " " I did , " she answered , lowering her eyes . " In it did you not state that you had brought this action hoping for a settlement which would relieve your financial embarrass-ment ? " " That was what I wrote you . " " Did n't you appeal to my generosity to stretch my conscience , if necessary , to give you something ? " " Yes . " Storrow inflated his chest . Already he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further in regard to your father 's check to Mr. Kreck for twenty-five thousand dollars  --  I quote-I can-. not prove that it was not merely a gift or a repayment of money previously advanced ' ? " " Those are my words . "  |p147Judge  Lamar swung toward the witness in astonishment . The spectators were flabbergasted . Could Elsie Beaufort realize what she was saying ? " And that 's the truth , is n't it ? " " I would n't have said so if it was n't . " " So , " the lawyer cried , with a triumphant sweep of the courtroom , " you ca n't testify to anything that would show your father 's check to be other than a gift or the repayment of a loan ? " There was a momentary hush . Miss Beaufort raised her eyes . " Oh , yes , I can ! " she retorted quickly . Her answer caught Lawyer Storrow off balance . " What do you  --  mean ? " he stammered . " Did n't you admit in your letter that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge Culpepper said the law would n't let me prove it . " " Bravo ! " came from General Langhorne , followed by a burst of applause . " Humph ! " snorted Storrow , at what seemed so feeble an excuse . " If that is the best explanation you can give , I offer the letter in evidence . That is all . " And he sat down with a gesture of finality . But Old Man Tutt was already on his feet . " Not all , by any means ! " he remarked blandly . . . . " Miss Beaufort , how did you come to write this letter ? " " Because you asked me to . You dictated it and I wrote down what you said . " " Is there a single untruthful word in it ? " " So far as I know , not one . " Mr. Tutt looked boldly at Judge Lamar . " Now , Miss Beaufort , tell his honor and this jury all the circumstances surrounding the delivery of this **32;644;TOOLONG by your father to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Storrow . " Your objection is valueless , " replied Mr. Tutt . " Subdivision Six of the statute expressly provides that where the personal representative of the deceased has introduced a witness interested in the event of a suit , who has testified as to transactions or communications on the part of the surviving party with a deceasedparty , the surviving party may be examined in reference to such facts testified to by said witness . ' " " But I have not introduced any such witness ! " retorted the lawyer . " Indeed you have . The witness now upon the stand ! First you invoked the statute to prevent her from testifying as my witness , but then , not satisfied with having done so , you made her your own witness by putting the same question to her as I had . I took it down . So you ca n't testify to anything that would show your father 's check to be other than a gift or the repaymentof a loan ? ' " " I did n't ask her for any conversations ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked her to confirm the statement in her letter . " " You invited her to testify that there were no conversations . Had she done so , you would have used her evidence to argue that the law must construe the transaction to be a gift or repayment . On the strength of what her letter apparently stated , you naturallyexpected Miss Beaufort to say No , ' whereas she , in fact , said Yes . ' You ca n't have your cake and eat it ! " Mr. Storrow 's forehead glistened with sweat . He 'd put his foot in it that time all right . " That 's all balderdash ! " he replied . " Subdivision Six of the statute ca n't be twisted to cover a question put to a plaintiffp149testifying in his own behalf . I had no intention of making Miss Beaufort my witness , and I have not done so . " Judge Lamar , who had been examining the code , looked down at the discomfited attorney . " I 'm not so sure about that , Mr. Storrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your position , Mr. Tutt ? I confess the point is a new one to me . " " Plenty . For one  --  Lydia Pinkham Medicine Company against Gibbs , I o8 Georgia 138 . " He handed a book to the clerk , who passed it up to the judge . His Honor glanced first at the decision , then at the lawyers , and finally , with a look of satisfaction , at his friends in the audience . " I rule that Mr. Tuft 's question is a proper one . . . . Go ahead , Elsie  --  I mean , Miss Beaufort . You may tell us of any conversations you may have heard between your father and Mr. Kreck regarding the delivery of this check . " " I except , " muttered Storrow . Even if Upsher refrained from murdering him , he 'd never make the Oglethorpe Club now .

" asked Mr. Tutt with elaborate politeness . The lawyer shook his head ; he never wanted to cross-examine another witness as long as he lived . " If the evidence is all in , you may go to the jury , " said Judge Lamar . Mr. Tutt slowly unjointed himself . It was the high spot of the trial . The enemy had been flanked , now they were to be routed . " If your honor please , I move to amend the complaint so that the pleadings may conform to the proof . "  |p150Lamar  glanced at him curiously ; this old Yank he 'd so often read about was almost as slick as they claimed . " In what respect ? " " So as to provide for judgment declaring The Kreck ManufacturingCompany a partnership between Beaufort and Kreck and their legal representatives , and for an accounting of the profits .

I shall not comment upon it more than to say that your verdict will retain one of the finest plantations in the state of Georgia in the hands of one of its most illustrious families , who have held it for eight generations . I know that you will do nothing to alter that opinion . " They did not disappoint him . " We find for the plaintiff , " said the foreman , when they returned to the courtroom after a brief retirement . From the vicinityof the general came a smothered version of the old-fashioned rebel yell . " Thank you all for saving Beaulieu ! " cried Elsie with tears in her eyes . . . . " Thank them , Hugh ! " " Thank Mr. Tutt , you mean ! " growled Judge Culpepper . " He certainly put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , gentlemen !

" They wo n't ! " confidently returned the chief justice . General Langhorne rose to his feet and raised his glass . " Gentlemen , " he cried , " here 's to one Yankee , anyhow , who 's done Georgia a good turn ! Let 's drink to  --  to Colonel Ephraim Tutt ! Hi-yi-yi ! "  |p152MR  . TUTT had seen the little white-haired woman in the elevatormore than once before she appeared in his office  --  adorable , he thought . He always had a weakness for old ladies . " I 'm Mrs. Harper Maxwell , " she said . " My husband often used to speak of you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Harvard together . Please sit down . What can I do for you ? " She took from her bag an oblong paper  --  a demand note for $15,000 to her order , dated two years back , and signed " Edward W. Casler . " " I was wondering if you could recover the money I gave Mr. Casler to invest for me . His office is right upstairs . " " You lent him the money ? " " No , he was to invest it . The note , he said , was just for added security . But I have n't received a cent of interest and , although I 've asked for the principal over and over again , he keeps putting me off . Now the real-estate company threatens to take my house . " " Come with me , " said Mr. Tutt , straightway leading her to Casler 's office . A portly gentleman with oyster eyes was sitting at a desk surrounded by blueprints of mining properties and photographs of oil wells which gave the room an atmosphere of cozy financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the lawyer . " I have called to find out what you have done with the money my client gave you to invest . " " Mrs. Maxwell has evidently misinformed you , " replied Mr. Casler curtly .

Well , there were n't any . I owe her on the note and expect to pay it , sometime . That 's all there is to it . " Mr. Tutt 's fingers twitched . " You cheap crook ! " he shouted , shaking his fist under Casler 's nose . " You 'll give Mrs. Maxwell back her money or else ! " " Violence wo n't get you anywhere , " calmly admonished the financier . " I regret that I ca n't meet my obligations . But I have plenty of other creditors . Mrs. Maxwell will have to take her turn . " Mr. Tutt needed only a few hours to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , much too clever to accept money under a promise of investment , lest he become criminally liable for embezzlement , induced his victims to take his worthless notes . Since imprisonment for debt had long since been abolished , he continued to live the life of Riley  --  nobody knew how  --  while thumbing his nose at those whom he had defrauded . Mrs. Maxwell had met Mr. Casler , she said , through a friend for whom he had made , or pretended to have made , some money , and had listened to his sales talk about investments largely because she had nothing else to occupy her mind . He had been so plausible that in the end she had turned over to him the $5,000 in bonds representing her savings and had put a $1 o , 000 mortgage on her house . Now it was all gone . Yet she was so lonely that she almost did n't care . If only she had a sister or someone of her own age to keep her company , she might be able to stand it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Casler interposed no defense to the action Mr. Tutt brought on Mrs. Maxwell 's note . Why should he ? One more judgment would make little difference when the others already taken against him totaled nearly $85,000 . Over and over , the lawyers for hisp154creditors had fruitlessly examined him under oath , in what is legally known as " supplementary proceedings , " in an effort to ascertain if he had any undisclosed assets . All the same , Mr. Tutt resolved to take a swing at him . The debtor appeared in Part Two of the Supreme Court not in the least perturbed . " Just a waste of time , " he remarked almost in formula . " I have n't had a bank account in years ; no bonds , stocks , notes , mortgages or any other securities ; no cash , no real estate , nothing ! I 'm cleaned out , a ruined man . It is n't worth your while to throw me into bankruptcy . Far better let me retain the outwardmarks of solvency , in the hope that someday I'il @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What do you live on ?

As you know , such trusts are exempt from attachment , except for ten per cent of the income , which amounts in my case to about two hundred and fifty dollars . Would you like to join the mourners ? " " How large is this trust ? " " A hundred thousand or so , " airily replied Casler . " What was your uncle 's name ? " " Edward Wasgatt . I was christened after him  --  favorite nephew and all that sort of thing . He was a wealthy mining operator with properties all over the West and offices in Helena , Denver and St. Louis . When he reached the age of seventy-five , he decided , in view of the excessive Federal decedent-estate taxes , to set up minor trusts during his life for such of his relatives as he wished to benefit , instead of doing so by will . He died about twelve years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the breadline , " he sighed . There was something about Casler 's manner that vaguely aroused Mr. Tuft 's suspicion . Amazing that mere avuncular be/neficence should have thus guaranteed the future livelihood of a ne'er-do-well . This uncle must have been clairvoyant . " What was his last address ? " he asked . " I do n't recall at the moment , " replied Casler . " I 'd have to look in my papers . " Indeed , thought Mr. Tutt , if a man had left me a hundred thousand , I think I 'd remember where he lived , even after twelve years ! " Who is the trustee ? " he continued . " The Omega Trust Company . They 'll be delighted to give you all the details . Apart from that , sorry as I am for Mrs. Maxwell , my only assets are a life membership in my club , the clothes I have on , and half a bottle of Jamaica rum . " The old man went back to his office , fuming at the inequity of a statute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be immune from the rights of creditors . Such " spendthrift trusts , " as they were called , were rightly held illegal in England , although allowed in most of the United States . He recollected one client of his who practically starved to death while his defaulting partner lived in luxury at the St. Regis Hotel . A spendthrift trust offered a way to beat the law , but was n't there some way to beat a spendthrifttrust ? After all , he did n't know much about Mr. Casler , except that he was obviously a very smooth article . Who had been this Santa Claus , his uncle ? It might be worth while to try to find out . When , in due course , his investigators reported that no personby the name of Edward Wasgatt had ever lived , done business or even been heard of in either Helena , Denver or St. Louis , Mr. Putt sat up and took notice . There was something queer about it all . An Edward Wasgatt had certainly signed the deed of trust . Mr. Tutt got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law of trusts . Suddenly , just as he was about to close the book , he slapped his knee . " By Jumping Jehoshaphat ! " he cried . " I believe I 've got it ! As York says in Richard the Second , Uncle me no uncle ! ' " " Bonnie , " he said the next morning to his handy man , " we 've got to locate Uncle Edward Wasgatt , quick or dead . He ca n't have disappeared spurlos versenkt . Of course , I could examine Casler again and perhaps force some more information out of him , but that would put him on his guard and he 'd find means to prevent our finding out anything more . There 's something rottenin the state of Denmark , but only Casler knows where Denmarkis . However , we can safely bank on just one thing . The moment Casler suspects that we think there 's something phony about Uncle Edward , he 'll bolt to where he lived  --  if he ever did live  --  in order to circumvent us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare chance , but it may work .

Stick to him like a postage stamp , and when you get to where he 's going , get all you can about the elusive Uncle Edward and wire me . At four o'clock , Mr. Tutt , loitering on the twenty-seventh floor , saw Mr. Casler emerge from his office and followed him into the elevator . " Why , it 's Mr. Casler ! " he exclaimed in apparent surprise . " Curiously enough , I was just thinking about you . The fact is we 've found out all about your dear old Uncle Edward . " He chuckled , then burst into suppressed laughter . " Edward Wasgatt , the Western millionaire ! Ha-ha ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is my floor . See you later ! " Bonnie Doon , sitting in driver 's cap and badge at the wheel of a sky-view taxi , saw Casler hurry up the steps of his boarding place . He seemed in considerable haste . Ten minutes later he re/appeared , carrying a suitcase , and sighting Bonnie 's cab on the corner jumped in and ordered him to drive to the Grand Central Station . At the Vanderbilt Avenue entrance he got out and descended to the upper concourse . Bonnie drove to the end of the turn , substituted a smart fedora for the cap , slipped on the coat of his suit , locked his cab and ducked after him through the crowd of home-going suburbanites . Unmindful of being followed , Mr. Casler went directly to a ticket window of the New York , New Haven &; Hartford .

" The old lady 's eyes shone . " Maine ? How wonderful ! What part of Maine ? " " Way down on the Bay of Fundy . I have a funny case there which may occupy me two or three days . Say the word and I 'll take you with me as my secretary , all expenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Maine for a month almost every summer . It 's beautiful . Do you really think I could ? " " Of course . I 'm your lawyer and you must follow my advice . It will make a new woman of you . " " All right , " she answered eagerly . " I 'd love to go . " All the August afternoon they sat on camp chairs on the rear platform of the day coach , watching the curving Maine coast with its blue inlets , its gray capes and pale outlying islands . " What is this business of yours ? " she asked him . " For me , it 's just a vacation . " " I hope that it may prove something more , " he answered . At the dilapidated fishing village of Stone Haven , Bonnie greeted them upon the platform and escorted them to the primitivehotel . " Casler led me a merry chase , " he said . " But I think we 've got what we want . I pretended I was a traveling salesman , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully satisfied with the result of his trip , and wholly reassured . Believe it or not , his late departed uncle lived at a place called Seal Cove on HardwoodIsland , ten miles out to sea . I 've hired a launch to take us there tomorrow . " " Is n't the air wonderful ! " exclaimed Mrs. Maxwell as they cast off from the dock the next morning and slipped down thep159channel . " It 's like champagne . And everything is so fresh and green  --  not a bit like New York . I 'm so glad you persuaded me to come . " The breeze stiffened and Mr. Tutt slipped an oilskin around her shoulders . For an hour they raced seaward , slicing through the rollers with the spindrift dashing in their faces , until , far out on the ocean , a gray shadow grew in definition until it had become an island with granite cliffs and fir-capped promontories , seeminglyuninhabited save by hundreds of snowy gulls . Soon they were at the mouth of a narrow inlet the shores of which , littered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steep sandy dunes to a daisy-covered meadow  --  Seal Cove . The pilot of the launch deposited them on the beach , whence they toiled up a path to a cluster of shacks , including a small store with the sign CHAS . W. WASGATT . A few houses were scattered against the pine grove that edged the meadow . Mr. Tutt pushed open the door . A wizened old man was smoking a pipe behind a counter exhibiting a dingy collection of candy , fish lines , hooks and sinkers , a few packages of breakfast food , and a miscellaneous conglomeration of hardware . " Are you Mr. Charles Wasgatt ? " inquired Mr. Tutt . " Yep , " answered the storekeeper . " That 's my name . " " Can you tell us where to find Mrs. Edward Wasgatt ?

" " If he was , I did n't see him . " He got up and shuffled off into the rear . As they started up the road they caught sight of Mr. Wasgatt sneaking across the meadow toward a well-built house surrounded by a neat picket fence and flower garden on the top of the rise . A cow and a flock of sheep were grazing near by . Over the door was a little painted sign : JUNIPER COTTAGE . The storekeeper blocked their approach outside the gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he snapped . " Y ' ca n't go in there ! " " Why not ? " demanded Mr. Tutt . " ' Cause I forbid ye ! " He opened his coat , displaying a nickelplatedbadge affixed to his suspenders .

" Do you want to be removed for malfeasance in office ? Get out of my way ! " " Touch me if you dare ! " snarled Wasgatt . " I 'll arrest ye fer disorderly conduct , breach o ' the peace and assault on an officer . " Unwisely , he raised his fist . Doon thrust forward and the constableducked , brushing his shoulder .

" This is the most beautiful spot I 've ever seen in my life . Ca n't we come in and rest for a moment ? " Mrs. Wasgatt 's expression softened . " I do n't want to seem inhospitable , " she said , leading them into a sunny , spotless kitchen facing the ocean , adding with stiff ceremony , " Please be seated . " The breeze from the open windows was laden with grassy smells ; above the drone of bees and the rasping of locusts rose the tinkle of cowbells and the bleat of sheep ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across a sparkling sea . " Magic casements , opening on the foam , ' " murmured the old man . " How you must love it ! " exclaimed Mrs. Maxwell . " I wish I lived here ! " " It is pretty , is n't it ? " agreed Mrs. Wasgatt . " But it gets awful lonely in winter  --  especially if there 's a gale offshore . Sometimes we do n't have any mail or newspapers for weeks at a time . And there is n't any doctor nearer than Stone Haven . I get terribly depressed living here all by myself . " " Women living alone are exposed to many dangers , " commentedMr . Tutt . " Mrs. Maxwell is in a like situation . In her case , a man stole fifteen thousand dollars from her . His name was Edward Wasgatt Casler . " " Fifteen thousand dollars ! " gasped their hostess .

" For instance , whether your husband ever was in the mining business . " " Mining business ! " ejaculated Mrs. Wasgatt . " He was a lobsterman . He never left this island but once during all the thirtyfouryears I was married to him . That was a long time ago , when he got a letter from Eddie with a money order for a hundred dollars , inviting him to come to New York . He was gone about ten days and had a wonderful time .

I do n't suppose you 'd care to come to New York with us for a visit ? You could stay as long as you wished  --  all expenses paid , of course . " " Do you really mean it ? " Mrs. Wasgatt 's lips trembled with excitement . " How wonderful ! " Just then Bonnie strolled around the corner . " What did you do with Charlie ? " asked Mrs. Wasgatt . " I locked him in the jail , " grinned Mr. Doon . " Good ! " she cried delightedly . " I never did like him either ! " For six weeks , Mrs. Wasgatt had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and both old ladies were having the time of their lives . They were widows of approximately thep163same age , both felt the need of companionship , and both had the same simple , homely tastes . Mornings they helped each other with the housework , and in the afternoons Mrs. Maxwell showed Mrs. Wasgatt the city . They called each other Eliza and Hannah . Meanwhile , Mr. Tutt , who had previously lodged an attachmentfor " 15,000 against the Casler trust , brought an action in the Supreme Court to set it aside . But Mr. Casler felt no concern . The New York statutes rendered the trust ironclad as against creditors . He was as safe as a church . So , on the morning of the trial , he sat calmly at the counsel table and gave the redoubtable firm of Tutt &; Tutt the glassy eye . " Why should I set aside this trust , Mr. Tutt ? " inquired Judge Blanchard , after glancing over the papers . " It 's been in operation for nearly sixteen years . " " Because , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease while his creditors starve . He swindled my client out of fifteen thousand dollars . The total amount of the judgments secured against him is ninety-eight thousand dollars , yet the law will not allow the trust to be touched , although there is enough to pay all his debts . Such trusts are illegal in England , and ought to be here ! " His honor nodded . " They were in the United States until 1876 , when the Supreme Court reversed itself in Nichols versus Easton , " he said . " I 'm inclined to agree that they ought to be abolished , but I do n't see what I can do about it . " " That is why I am here , " said Mr. Tutt quietly . " Will the trust officer of the Omega please take the stand ? . . . Mr. Wilson , what do you recall about the establishment of this **31;678;TOOLONG ? " " It was some years ago , " answered Mr. Wilson crisply . " Mr. Casler , one of our clients , brought in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter had a white beard and very rough hands . The papers had already been drawn by Mr. Callahan , the attorney for Mr. Casler , and were on my desk . Mr. Wasgatt handed us his check for the principal of the trust , plus our first year 's commission  --  twenty-five hundred dollars . We executedthe instrument , assumed the position of trustee and investedthe money . It was ordinary routine business . " " On what bank was Mr. Wasgatt 's check drawn ? " " I do n't remember . We do n't keep any record of checks under such circumstances if they go through the clearing-house , but at your request I recently had our file clerk go over all the papers very carefully . The only thing he found was a pencil jotting N.Y.T. ' on the back of the deposit slip , which , as I told you , might possibly indicate that the check had been drawn on the New York Trust Company . " " Thank you , " said Mr. Tutt . . . . " Now , will Mr. Casler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prosperouslookingas always , came forward with entire confidence . Well he might , for every scrap of paper connected with the formation of the trust had been burned up years ago  --  letters , checks , counterfoils , and all . Nothing remained but the instrument itself , signed by a dead man . Moreover , his trip to Stone Haven had satisfied him that Mr. Tutt had been bluffing about his knowledge of Uncle Edward . " At one time you were highly successful , were you not , Mr. Casler ? " " Before 1929 everyone was , " replied the witness with a deprecatingsmirk . " How much were you worth in 1928 ? " " I really have no idea . " " Well over a hundred thousand ? " " You flatter me . " " Who created this trust ? "  | " My maternal uncle , Edward Wasgatt ; now dead . " " I believe he was a promoter of Western mining properties ? " " Among other interests , " hedged Casler . " Did he set this trust up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he wired me quite unexpectedly that he was on his way to New York for that purpose . He stayed with me at the WaldorfAstoriafor several days , during which I took him around to the Omega Trust , where he made arrangements to put up the necessaryfunds . " " Do you know just how he did it ? " " I assume that he transferred the money by check from one of his various accounts in the West . " " Where did you do your own banking at this time ? " " I had several accounts . One in the Omega , one in the ChaseNational , one in the Corn Exchange . Let me see  --  " He hesitated . " Did you have one in the New York Trust ? " Casler shot a quick look at the lawyer . " I may have . I know that at one time I had one there . " " Of course you did n't yourself give him the money to put in trust for you ? " " Certainly not . My uncle was voluntarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why on earth should a man tie up a hundred thousand dollars that way ? " " The reason is simple enough  --  so that his creditors could n't get at it either . Sometimes it is called , laying up money for a rainy day . ' Crooks , I believe , refer to it as fall money . ' " Mr. Casler bridled . " Are you insinuating that I 'm a crook ? " " I am insinuating nothing . Any allegations I have to make I shall prove . " The hell he would prove them , thought Casler . The rickety old fossil could n't prove a thing . Mr. Tutt cleared his throat and stroked his chin . " Would itp166surprise you , Mr. Casler , to learn that , when this trust was created , you , in fact , had a very active account in the New York Trust Company , that you introduced your uncle to the officers there and arranged for him to open a checking account , and that on September 4 , 1928 , he deposited a single check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five hundred dollars , and on the very same day transferred that exact amount , also by check , to the Omega Trust as the capital of this trust ? " Mr. Casler twisted uneasily . The old fossil must be only guessing . " Not particularly , " he retorted . " Perhaps Mr. Wasgatt preferred to make a deposit there and draw a check against it in order to save the time necessary for an out-of-town clear-ance . " " Perhaps ! " Mr. Tutt paused . . . . " Did your Uncle Edward leave a widow ? " Casler stiffened . The old fossil was getting warmer . " I  --  I believe he did . " " Do you know where she lives ? " " Only that she has a summer cottage on the Maine coast some-where . " Mr. Tutt turned to the rear of the courtroom . " Will Mrs. Wasgattplease stand up ? . . . Is that your Aunt Hannah ? You call her that , do n't you ? " Casler did not answer . A sickly pallor had spread over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance . " I object . It is immaterial how my client addresses his uncle 's widow . What has that got to do with the validity of this trust ? " Judge Blanchard regarded the learned counselor thoughtfully . " I do n't know myself at this moment , " he mused , " but I give Mr. Tutt credit for not wishing to waste the time of the court . " " I 'll withdraw the question and put another , " said the old man.  | " Did you not swear in supplementary proceedings that your Uncle Edward was a wealthy mining promoter with offices in Denver , Helena and St. Louis ? " He held up the notarized examination . Casler did not answer . " I do n't remember , " he replied huskily , after a moment . " In point of fact , your Uncle Edward Wasgatt --  -- for whom you were named  --  was a lobsterman of Seal Cove , Hardwood Island , Maine , who had never been out of his native state in his life until you sent for him to come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glassily without reply . Mr. Tutt took a letter from his pocket and handed it to Judge Blanchard , who read it curiously " Is that your signature , Mr. Casler ? " asked his honor . Casler squirmed . He had forgotten all about that letter . But what difference did it make ? There was not a scrap of paper in existence to show that he had used Uncle Edward as a dummy . " Ye-es , I suppose so , " he admitted . " And you claim that this lobsterman , your uncle , out of his own funds created a hundred-thousand-dollar trust for your bene-fit ? " " I do , " asserted Casler impudently . " Now let 's see , " went on Mr. Tutt . " To be specific , did n't you , on September 4 , I928 , draw a check for a hundred and two thousand , five hundred dollars against your own account at the New York Trust Company to the order of Edward Wasgatt , which he coincidently deposited in his own name ? " " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you arrange to have him immediately draw his own check against that deposit for a hundred and two thousand , five hundred dollars to the order of the Omega Trust Company ? " " I did not ! "  | " I object to this whole line of questioning ! " blustered the great Callahan . " It is entirely irrelevant ! " " Irrelevant ? " queried Mr. Tutt . " When Section Thirty-four of the New York Personal Property Law expressly provides : A transfer of personal property made in t  --  ust for the use of the person making it is void as against the creditors of such person . ' " " There is not a particle of evidence , " shouted Callahan , " that the funds used to create this trust did not , in fact , belong to Edward Wasgatt , whatever his place of residence or means of livelihood ! He might have acquired the money in any one of a dozen ways ! " " Objection overruled , " said Blanchard , who was studying Mr. Casler curiously . " Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand dollars , unless he had found Captain Kidd 's treasure while emptying his lobster pots ? " Mr. Tutt opened a portfolio . " I 'll show your honor where he got it . . . . Did you ever hear of a microfilmed check , Mr. Casler ? " " Not that I know of . " " Then perhaps you will be surprised to learn that for a number of years many of the New York banks have made a practice of microfilming every check charged against an account before returning it ? " A band of sweat beaded Casler 's forehead as the old man held up the enlarged photostats of two checks drawn on the New York Trust Company , each for $Io2,5oo-one to the order of Edward Wasgatt on September 4 , 1928 , signed Edward W. Casler , and another of the same date and amount , signed by Edward Wasgatt , to the order of the Omega Trust Company . " I now move that this trust be set aside as void against creditors , " Mr. Tutt said , " and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury on a charge of perjury. "  |p169Casler  , his head sunk on his chest clung with white knuckles to the arms of the witness chair . Callahan jumped to his feet . " The witness is still on the stand ! I ask that he be given the opportunity to correct his testimony ! " " Do you wish to recant ? " asked Judge Blanchard contemptuously . Casler swallowed twice , then nodded . " Yes . I did draw that check , " he acknowledged . " Step down ! " thundered his honor . " This is a contemptible fraud . I declare this trust null and void , and authorize the sheriff to levy upon both principal and interest . I shall hold this man for the action of the grand jury . " " You ca n't do that ! " interposed Callahan . " There is no penal statute forbidding the creation of such a trust . " " Unfortunately , you are right ! " retorted his honor . " I shall hold him for perjury . " " He has already recanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Only of his perjury committed here today , " countered Mr. Tutt , holding up Casler 's sworn deposition in supplementary proceedings . " Not of that in this affidavit , in which he described his uncle as a millionaire mining man living in the West . " " Quite so ! " agreed Blanchard . . . . " Sheriff , take this man into custody . Adjourn court . " As Casler was led away , the two old ladies hurried down the aisle . " Shall I really get back my fifteen thousand dollars ? " asked Mrs. Maxwell incredulously . " Every cent of it , with interest , " the old man assured her . " We hardly dared to hope for it , " added Mrs. Wasgatt , " but just in case things came out this way , Eliza and I have a lovely plan . From now on , I 'm going to spend six months of every year with her here in New York , and she 's going to pass the other six with me on Hardwood Island . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch of asperity . " Have n't you forgotten about my fee ? " " So I have ! " apologized Mrs. Maxwell . " I 'm so sorry ! What does it come to ? " The old lawyer took a long pull on his stogie . " I do n't know to a penny , " he replied , looking whimsically down at her . " But I 'll compromise for two weeks every August at Juniper Cottage . "  |p171MR  . TUTT was not superstitious . He would walk under a ladder , sit down thirteen at table , or light three stogies from a single match without a second thought . In a word , he was hard boiled and " knew a hawk from a hand saw . " He was reading peacefully in his library one winter evening when a succession of bloodcurdling shrieks came from below stairs . Fearful lest Mandy Waters , his only servant , was being murdered , he seized a poker and hurried down to the kitchen . The cook knelt in hysterics on the floor , her arms raised in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat , black frock coat , Gladstone collar and white tie , who , with eyeballs rolling , was pointing the index finger of each hand at the unhappy woman and chanting : " By de Bloody Goat , by de Black Hen , by de Big Snake Umpalla  --  EnochWaters is gwine die ! Yassuh ! You kin tell him Brother Paul say he gwine pass out mighty quick ! He gwine diedie  --  die ! " Brandishing his poker the old lawyer advanced courageously upon the clerical-looking intruder . " Get out of my house ! " he ordered . " Make yourself scarce or I 'll send for the police ! " The Negro snatched a small bundle from the table and stuffed it under his coat . " Enoch Waters is gwine die ! " he repeated , fixing the old man with a reptilian stare . " He gwine pass away and nuthin ' kin stop him ! Doan ' try to cross me . He gwine die die  --  die ! " He stalked swiftly out , banging the front door behind him . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat limply , her face in her hands . " What 's the meaning of all this ? " he demanded . " What was that fellow doing here ? " Mandy lowered her head . " He were n't doin ' nuff'n ! " she mumbled . " You made enough noise about it !  --  What is his name ? " " Brother Paul . " " What was that thing he took off the table ? " " Ah didn ' see nuff'n on de table ! " answered Mandy stubbornly . Mr. Tutt realized that he was up against something he did not understand . It was the first time in their long association that Mandy had not been completely frank and open with him . " Well , Mandy , " he said , giving her a pat on the shoulder , " you do n't have to tell me anything unless you want to ! The best thing for you is to go up to bed and try to get a good night 's sleep . " Once back in his library Mr. Tutt found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stalwart , good-natured woman who had served him so well these many years , while of his countlessfriends in all classes of society there was none of whom he thought more highly than her husband , the dignified , gray-haired " redcap " at the Pennsylvania Station . Both had been born in Haiti and brought as children to the United States where their people had settled at Point a la Hache below New Orleans . After their marriage the couple had migrated from Louisiana to New York , and while nominally domiciled in a small flat in Harlem Enoch spent most of his off time in the old man 's kitchen . Mr. Tutt was vaguely aware that traces of voodooism lingered among the two hundred and fifty thousand population of Harlem . What was voodoo , anyhow ? He took down a volume from his bookcase , and ran through the index.  | " Voodoo , " he read , " is the name given to certain superstitions and secret rites , originating in Africa , and transplanted first to Haiti and other West Indies islands , and thence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Authoritative evidence is lackingas to the exact form of these practices which are alleged to include serpent worship , bloody sacrifices , and even cannibalism , but there is no doubt that voodooism is an actual religion with an organized priesthood . In addition to mere abracadabra and trickery calculated to impress ignorant minds , witch doctors and their initiates possess a wide knowledge of poisons , their effects and antidotes . Their chief power , however , based on the fear of evil spirits , is derived from the arts of hypnotism and suggestion . The last high priestess of the cult in the United States was Marie Laveau of New Orleans . Certain of her collateral descendants , surnamed Alexander , claim similar powers . " Mr. Tutt lifted the window shade and peered out . " Brother Paul " was pacing up and down under the electric light across the street , staring fixedly at the house . " Mandy , " said Mr. Tutt after breakfast , " you know that I 'm your friend . Why not let me try to help you ? Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does he want ? " Mandy put down her tray of dishes . " Mr. Tutt , dis Brother Paul sho ' done fix Enoch . He 's jes ' fadin ' away to nuff'n . He ai n't done no work fo ' six weeks . He jes ' sits mopin ' ' round de flat wif his sister Viny lookin ' out fo ' him . De white doctor say nuff'n de matter with Enoch , but he du n no ' bout dem things . Dis Brother Paul is de most bardacious conjure-man in Harlem . He 's been hangin ' ' round fo ' a long time teasin ' me ter git a divorce from Enoch and marry him . But at fust all he done was to throw dust at me . " " What do you mean  --  ' dust ' ? " " Happy Dust ' an ' Love me Quick '  --  dey 's powerful strong ,  | but I bought uncrossin ' powders an ' dusted de do ' step of de flat an ' sprinkled mustard seed roun ' it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cause he could n't git across . Dat 's de reason he fix Enoch  --  ' cause if Enoch dies he 'll git me sho ' ! " " And you really believe this , Mandy ? " " Ai n't I seen it doin ' , Mr. Tutt ? Dat 's why Ah called in de two-headed doctor  --  Brother Hiram  --  and paid him a hundred dollars . He done eberything he knew how accordin ' to de rule . But it ai n't done no good an ' Enoch keeps right on dyin ' . " " Why do n't you have this Brother Paul arrested for disturbing you ? " " Ah 's tried dat . Ah hired Counsellor Jackson an ' we went to de police co't an ' asked fo ' a warrant , but de jedge jes ' chased us out . He said to go away an ' not trouble him ' bout no nonsense like dat . " " What has Brother Paul done to fix Enoch  --  as you call it ? " A look of terror came into Mandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bout dat , " she answered in a whisper . " But dere 's things kin be done an ' Brother Paul is doin ' ' em . " There was nothing in the brightly lit shops and beauty parlors of Seventh Avenue to suggest the mysterious and unholy rites of the African jungle as Mr. Tutt and his friend Dr. Caleb Whiting , the well-known psychiatrist , taxied northward that evening to the Waterses ' flat . The sidewalks and entrances to the movie houses were thronged , everywhere radios blared , while from second-story windows , inside which the jitterbugs were disporting themselves , came the muffled wail of saxophones and the beat of drums . Turningwest towards Amsterdam Avenue , the environment changed to one of dimly lit streets lined with shabby tenements . The Waterses ' flat was one flight up over a fish-fry shop on the window of which was scrawled in whitewash : " Porgies 5  --  . " Viny ,  |p175Mandy  's sister-in-law , received them in a front room crowded with overstuffed furniture and decorated with chromos in ornate gilt frames . Waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulders shrouded in a worsted shawl that matched the gray of his hair , arose and took a few feeble steps in their direction . When Mr. Tutt had last seen him he had been a powerful man in robust health . Now he was shockingly emaciated . " Thank you fo ' comin ' ! " he said . " You is sho ' very kind . But Ah 's ' feared nobody kin help me ! Dere some things nobody kin do nuff'n ' bout ! " " How long have you been feeling this way ? " asked Dr. Whiting . " ' Bout ten weeks . Ah 's lost forty pounds in de las ' two months . " While the doctor took Enoch 's pulse Mr. Tutt peeked into the adjoining room . At the further end , beneath a lithographed calendaradvertising a sewing machine , an altar draped in black had been rigged from a commode on which , around a crudely carved figure , burned nine black candles . Below the effigy stood a vinegar jar containing a beef heart , slit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peppers . " It 's a typical case of malevolent suggestion , " said Whiting as they went downstairs . " There 's not a thing the matter with that wretched men so far as his bodily functions are concerned . He has a fever of I04 degrees , sweating fits and severe sporadic pains in the abdomen , back and chest . He says they 're like burningswords and get worse every day . The fact that they 're imaginarymakes no difference . They 're perfectly real to him . He clearly has a fear psychosis which may actually result in death . The only thing that can cure him is to get rid of it  --  but how that can be done I 've no idea .  --  I 'm afraid I must leave you now . If you find out anything , let me know .  --  Good night and good luck ! " " Brother Paul , " according to Viny , lived in the rear of a small drugstore in an adjoining side street . A crudely lettered signp176over the door read : " All Kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed , but through the window Mr. Tutt could see shelves and show cases exhibiting a few cut-rate supplies , pattentmedicines , stationery and candy . In the rear of the shop was a door curtained off with calico . As he stood in the shadow ponderinghis next move Brother Paul came shuffling along , unlocked the door , turned up the gas , took off his tall hat and coat and threw back the curtain . And then the old lawyer experienced an eerie thrill . Before his very eyes , dangling from a string , hung a grotesque doll crudely dressed in the uniform of a railway porter , its tufts of gray hair surmounted by a small red cap . The image , pierced by half a dozen pins , spun slowly in the draught . Could this be New York ? As he looked down the long tunnel of the street towards Seventh Avenue its distant glare seemed like the glow over a witch 's cauldron and the beat of the drums in the cheap night club opposite like that of a native dance . But now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole business was nonsense , of course , yet the fact remained that Enoch Waters was dying . All that night , to the accompaniment of Brother Paul 's stealthy footsteps across the street , he ransacked his library for books dealing with sorcery , charms and spells . Professor Frazer in his " Golden Bough " devoted no less than one hundred and fifty pages to what he termed " sympathetic magic , " in which he showed that to torture or kill one 's enemy by making an image of him had been a common practice in every age and clime from the days of the Pharaohs to the present . It had been familiar to the Babylonians , Greeks and Romans , to the Hindus , Arabs , and Javanese , was still in use among the Indians of Peru , Mexico , and North America , the natives of Burma , Borneo , the South Sea Islands , Africa and even of Scotland . In Haiti such an image called a " wanga " or " ouanga , " was a favorite weapon among the witch doctors. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cure or antidote ! Yet cure there must be , for whoever could cast a spell must be able to remove it . Next morning Bonnie Doon made his report about voodooism in Harlem . " It has n't been an easy job , " he said . " They keep the genuine voodoo stuff mighty quiet up there , although there 's plenty goes on among the monkey chasers ' as they call the West Indians . Of course they do n't perform the same rites as in Africa . Naturallyyou could n't sacrifice a black sheep in a three room flat without attracting attention , but some of the things they do= like burying black cats and drunken roosters alive and making stews out of lizards and bats  --  would give you the creeps . Only a few know anything about it , and it would be as much as your life was worth to try to find out . " " How about charms ? " asked Mr. Tutt . " The whole district is lousy with ' em , " answered Bonnie . " A friend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the district for years tells me that twenty-five per cent of the prisoners brought into the 135th Street Police Station carry conjurebags in their pockets or tied around their necks , crammed with terrapin 's bones or buzzards ' wings , messed up with roots and herbs . You can buy any sort of charm you 're willing to pay for , if you know where to go for it . They used to be sold right over the counter in the smaller drugstores , but since the prosecutionsfor practicing unlicensed medicine , they 're bootlegged in the tenement houses . The cops know pretty well who does it  --  Brother Hiram  --  Brother Alfred  --  Brother Moses  --  Brother Paul  --  they 're all brothers of some sort . Often they pretend to be parsons or preachers . " " What are the charms for ? "  | " Everything you can think of . Adam and Eve Dust ' keeps away burglars , " Rooming House Dust ' attracts tenants , Lucky Hand Roots ' picks winning numbers , Boss Fixed Dust ' will hold your job or get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the family , Four Thieves Vinegar ' breaks up the happiest of homes , and Black Snake Root , ' Demanding Powder , ' or VanVan ' can do most anything . " " Does each charm have its antidote ? " " Sure ! That 's how they make their money . Someone puts a hex on you with Black Cat 's Ankle Dust ' for which he pays five dollars , and you have to neutralize it with Big John the Conqueror ' that costs fifty . It 's all mixed up with religion in a queer sort of way . In fact the biggest traffic goes on in what they call holy stores . ' I visited the one run by an old bird called Brother Alfred and it 's a weird joint . He carries almost everything needed for voodoo right on the premises  --  lizards , snakes , black cats , chickens , doves and baby bats , besides paraphernalia for magic shows , spiritualistic seances and initiations into secret societies , along with a big line of wands , candles , black drapery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bats from Texas and the skulls from a regular medical supply house . The queer thing about it all is that although he makes a business of it , he seems to believe in it more or less himself . Here 's the address if you 'd like to go there . " The " holy store " was in a rear tenement at the end of a narrow alley off Eighth Avenue , and to reach the door marked " Religious Supplies " Mr. Tutt had to grope his way across a back yard overgrown with burdocks and half filled with empty crates and chicken coops . Inside , a weazened white-headed Negro in a black velvet skull cap and soiled dressing gown crouched over a stove stirring something in an iron pot . The discolored walls of the dank and musty room were lined with shelves on which stood rowsp179of bottles , bundles of weird-looking roots , bones , skulls , and boxes labeled " High Conquering Incense , " " Waahoo Bark , " " Asafetida , " " Earth from the Mount of Olives , " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wands , " and " Candles . " A sickly sweet smell hung over everything . At the jangle of the bell the Negro stopped his stirring and shifted his rheumy eyes suspiciously towards the old lawyer . " What you lookin ' fo ' ? " he demanded huskily . " I was wondering if you could sell me a wanga ? " " Nebber heard o ' sech a thing . " " An image then . " " You mean a doll ? Sho ' Ah kin sell you a doll . " FIe scuffed into an adjoining room and returned with a pasteboardbox containing a double-row of waxen images about four inches in length . The label read : " Occult M'f'g Co. , Bridgeport , Conn . " " How many does you want ?  --  Dey only costs a quarter . " " One will be enough , " said Mr. Tutt . Then his eye caught the word " Ectoplasm " on a wooden box having a glass side and filled with a white liquid . " What 's that ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a button . Immediately the contents became dimly illuminated and a hooded shape roughly resembling a man floated upwards . The startlingly lifelike action of the homunculus gave Mr. Tutt an odd sensation in his stomach . " Hit sho ' knocks ' em ! " chuckled the black man . " What 's yo ' line ? " " Just magic , " said Mr. Tutt . " Ah got mos ' eberything . " He pointed to a row of volumes dealing with the occult , from " The Lost Books of Moses " to Paracelsus and Cagliostro . " Would you like to earn fifty dollars ? " asked the lawyer.  |p180The  rheumy eyes glistened , then shifted over Mr. Tutt 's shoulder . " Ah reckon so , " he hesitated . " Suppose someone made an image of a friend of yours to put an evil spell on him , what would you do to break it ? Tell me  --  and I 'll make it a hundred . " He turned as the floor creaked behind him . Brother Paul 's black face leered at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he chuckled . " Ah wants two dozen baby bats . " " This voodoo stuff has got me down , Bonnie , " declared Mr. Tutt on his return to the office . " Enoch Waters is dying by inches and ca n't last much longer . I want you to drop everything else and try to locate a witch doctor more powerful than Brother Paul . I do n't care what it costs or where you have to go to find him . There must be someone  --  in New Orleans perhaps . It 's our only hope . " Bonnie disappeared from the office and ten days passed without a word from him . Meanwhile , Enoch Waters grew steadily worse , in spite of the nine black candles that continued to burn upon the commode and the black cats and drunken roosters which Mr. Tutt suspected were being buried by Brother Hiram . The unfortunate man was now barely able to stand and , in consequence , the lawyer ordered his removal from the Harlem flat to his own Twenty-third Street house where Dr. Whiting could keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Brother Paul , who continued his nocturnal prowlings up and down the block . The old man had never felt so helpless . Was it conceivablethat the law could afford no relief under such circum-stances ? " " Sam , " he said to his friend Judge Stafford at the conclusionp181of their next Saturday night poker game at the Colophon Club , " would you be willing to strain a point to prevent a murder ? " His Honor , a benign , smooth-shaven man , paused in the act of scooping up his winnings . " Murder ? " " Yes , murder most foul as in the best it is , but this most foul , strange and unnatural . ' " Stafford stacked and measured his piles of chips , and removinga small white object from beside them , placed it in the pocket of his waistcoat . " Three hundred and seventeen bucks ! My luck stays with me ! " he announced with satisfaction . " What point do you want me to strain ? " Mr. Tutt outlined the situation . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of whom I am very fond , is dying as surely as if he were being poisoned . As a judge of the Supreme Court , in addition to wide equitable powers , you have those of a police magistrate . Ca n't you issue a warrant for assault or attempted murder against this Brother Paul ? " Judge Stafford studied the smoke from his cigar . " I 'd like to help you , but there 's no precedent for doing so . The difficulty is that the law defines an assault as an act other than the mere speaking of words . ' Now here , as I understand it , the only physical act involved is the making of an image and sticking pins into it  --  none of which the victim sees  --  and sending messagesthrough other parties that he is surely going to die . That 's not enough ! " " Is n't it enough that what this witch doctor is doing is undeniablysending Enoch Waters to his grave ? " " It might be if you could prove it to be a case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What you are asking me to do is in effect to recognize the existence of witchcraft . While it 's true we usedp182to have plenty of statutes against it and that under them a lot of miserable people , including the Salem witches , were hanged or burned for sorcery , fortunately all such foolish laws were repealedtwo hundred years ago . " " Most unfortunately , I should say ! " retorted Mr. Tutt . " I 'm not trying to put anything over on you , Sam , or to presume on our relationship , but you know as well as I do that the power of suggestion , given a proper subject , is as much fact as the explosiveforce of gunpowder . The English jurists had plenty of examples of it brought to their attention . Lord Bacon , as you may recall , declared that it was felony when a man doth use or practise any manner of sorcery , whereby any person shall be killed , wasted or harassed in his body , ' and Lord Hale held that it was murder for a witch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folderol either . People did die in those days by virtue of the evil influence of others , just as they do now . The trouble was that , in the public reaction to the terrible fate of those who were unjustly convicted under such laws , the legislatorswent too far the other way and left no legal remedy to protect the innocent victims of those who took advantage of their fears . If Enoch Waters is being wasted and harassed in his body ' in consequence of the acts of Brother Paul , the law should come to his rescue . " Moreover , " he went on , " the law today is not everywhere as ineffectual as you suppose . In the Soudan , for instance , the judicial officers of the British government hold a native who causes his enemy 's death by means of a zvanga to be guilty of murder , and our own law holds that a belief in witchcraft does not constitute an insane delusion and is not itself sufficient to invalidate a will . It would be a reflection upon the administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim of malevolentsuggestion like this ! "  |p183Judge  Stafford smiled leniently . " Well , Eph , " he said , " I do n't make the law , I only administerit . I 'm sorry there is n't any statute to fit the present case , but the fact is that the law can not cope with this sort of thing . It 's too subtle . No , I ca n't issue a warrant for your witch doctor for either assault or attempted murder . " " Then , Sam , " pleaded Mr. Tutt , " I ask you , as a judge sitting in equity , to issue an order enjoining Brother Paul from further molesting Enoch Waters . " Stafford shook his head . " The law , as you know , permits me to issue an injunction only where property rights are endangered  --  to prevent irreparabledamage . There 's no property involved here .

" I grant orders to show cause every day , almost as a matter of course . When do you want the hearing ? " " I 'm not quite sure , " answered Mr. Tutt , who had got all he had hoped for , " but I shall make my application in due course and in proper form .

" It was difficult for the old lawyer to believe , as he sat in His Honor 's sunlit chambers that he was actually invoking the power of the law to prevent what would have been unhesitatingly pronouncedas " witchcraft in the first degree " under the Statute of James the First forbidding under penalty of death the " exercisingof any enchantment , charm or sorcery , whereby any personshall be killed , destroyed , consumed , or lamed in his or her body , or any part thereof . " Yet there was no doubt that Enoch Waters ' body was being " destroyed and consumed . " He was a pitiful object as he sat propped in his chair , a mere shadow of his former self , with Dr. Whiting and Mandy beside him . Breathing heavily and with the sweat streaming down his sunken cheeks he shrank from the gaze of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of a snake . Indeed , the witch doctor , as if knowing that he was outside the law , seemed to be taking a fiendish satisfaction in what was going on , smirking and mouthing at his opponents . From time to time Mr. Tutt glanced nervously at his watch , wondering if Bonnie 's plane were late . Presently Judge Stafford came in and sat down in the swivel chair behind his desk . " Well , " he said taking up a bunch of papers , " if all the parties are present , we will proceed . " He looked across at Brother Paul . " Are you the respondent ? " " Ah got a paper to come down hyah , " replied the witch doctor unconcernedly , " but Ah du n no what fo ' . " " Did you make an image of Enoch Waters ? " " Ah made a doll ,  --  yussuh . Dey ain ' no law agin ' makin ' a doll . "  | " Let me see this so-called doll . " Brother Paul leaned over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened it and held up the wanga by its string . It was a ridiculous yet gruesome object in its grotesque gray uniform and small red cap like a monkey 's , while the pins with which it was partially transfixed made it look like an improvisedcushion . " Who is this supposed to represent ? " demanded the judge severely . " Hit doan ' represent nobody , Yo " Onner . " " What are these pins for ? " " Hit 's a pincushion . " " Whose hair is that ? " " Jes ' hair  --  ord'n'ry hair . " " Where did you get it ? " " Off'n de flo ' o ' de barber shop . " " And those pieces of fingernails ? " " Doan ' know nuff'n ' bout ' em .

I am satisfied that what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to issue an injunction restraining you from annoying him further , I have the power , sitting ex-officio as a police magistrate , to order the return of this stolen prop-erty . " Brother Paul 's thick lips curled in a sardonic grin . With an expression of malignant triumph he deliberately placed a thumb against one of the pins and drove it through the place where the wanga 's heart should have been . Coincidently Waters uttered a deep groan and toppled.to the floor . Amid screams from Mandy , Dr. Whiting unloosened the collar of the unconscious man and dashed a glass of water in his face , but there was no sign of life.  |  --  Enoch 's pulse had stopped . An exultant chuckle came from where Brother Paul was sitting . " He-he-he ! " he giggled . " He sho ' done kill hisself now !  --  He he-he ! " Judge Stafford sprang to his feet . " You black devil ! " he shouted furiously . " You ought to be hanged ! I He paused as the door opened disclosing upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brother Paul in frock coat , white tie and Gladstone collar . " If the court please , " announced Bonnie , " permit me to introduce the Reverend Doctor Gabriel Alexander of New Orleans ! " At the name Brother Paul stiffened in his chair , his eyes startingfrom his head . The newcomer shoved Mandy aside and droppingon his knees beside the prostrate Enoch , made rapid passes over his forehead . " Come back , Enoch ! Come back ! " he cried in a high-pitched monotone . " Yo ' time ain ' not yet ! Ah has overcome de powers of evil ! De Big Snake am gone ! Enoch , come back ! " Marvelously Enoch came back . A sigh issued from his lips , his eyelids quivered , and then opened wide . The Rev. Alexander motioned to Dr. Whiting to take charge of his patient . Clearly he had other business on hand , and he proceeded to attend to it with an agility surprising in one of his apparent age . Leaping towards Brother Paul and crouching so that their faces were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his forefinger . " Eh ! Eh ! Bomba , Hen ! Hen !

" Ah uncrosses everything ! Doan ' let the Snake git me , Alexander ! Doan ' cross me ! " But the Reverend was out to make a thorough job of it . Taking from his pocket an oblong packet wound with scarlet thread interspersed with feathers , he waved it over his victim 's head . " Ole Master keep yo ' promise , " he called loudly . " Cuss dis man ez Ah cuss ' im now and spite ' im ez Ah spite ' im ! Gib " im no peace in bed , no ' at his vittles , no ' kin he go hide nowheres !

" At these fateful words Brother Paul sprang to his feet and with a yell of terror bolted through the door . Meanwhile Dr. Whitingand Mandy had assisted Waters to his feet and re-established him in his chair . " You is all right , Enoch ! " declared the Reverend Alexander . " You is O.K. ! " Swiftly he picked up the wanga and sprang with it to the grate . He was there only an instant but when he turned around it had vanished . There was no trace of it whatever in the fire . " De spell am broken ! " he cried . " De Great Snake am gone ! You is all uncrossed ! Hallelujah ! Amen !  --  Say Amen ' , Enoch ! " " Amen ! " shouted Enoch vigorously . Mr. Tutt lingered behind after the others had gone . " Thank you very much , Sam ! " he said . " You helped save a man 's life . " Stafford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he admitted , moving in the direction of the fireplace . " But such superstition is incredible ! To think that suchp188things can happen in this day and age  --  right here in New York City !  --  Where the devil do you suppose that what-do-you -- call-it ' went to ? " He bent over and peered curiously into the grate of coals . As he did so a small white object popped out of his waistcoat pocket onto the floor . Mr. Tutt picked up the rabbit 's foot and handed it to him . " Almost incredible , Judge , " he corrected him.  |p189SQUIRE  HEZEKIAH MASON , feudal baron of Pottsville , New York , in his best Sunday suit and square derby hat , descendedthe steps of his bank with the intention of offering his hand and what heart he had to Miss Teresa Van Dorn , an attractive young lady of eighteen years , who lived with her crippledfather , Dirk Van Dorn , on the corner of Main and Walnut streets . That there was forty years ' disparity in their ages did n't faze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never yet found any girl willing to marry him , was used to being rebuffed . Crossing the village square , he came face to face with the wooden effigy of King Wagamoc in front of P. of H. Hall 769 . The celebrated Mohawk chieftain stood just outside Colson 's tobacco shop , shading his eyes with one hand and grasping his tomahawk in the other , as if with the instant intention of removingthe squire 's scalp . Not otherwise superstitious Mason could never escape a feeling that the Indian somehow had it in for him and it may well be that , if departed shades haunt the purlieus where they have suffered wrongs on earth , Wagamoc was the ectoplasmic representative of the countless mortgagors upon whom the Squire had foreclosed . Most cigar store Indians belong to standard and easily recognizedbrands , their size , sex , and costume depending upon their era , running from the diminutive effigies of the Princess Pocahontas in her kilt of tobacco leaves ( circa 1730 ) , up through the more efflorescent full-bottomed squaw of 178o , to the lifesized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ et seq . But Wagamoc , although of the latter class , differed from others in that he epitomized the history of Patterson County . It was from him that Arendt Van Corlear , cousin of the great patroon William Van Rensalaer , had in 1697 purchased one hundred and twenty-eight square miles of the fertile valley for " 600 hands of good whyte wampum , six Koates of Duffels , thirty barres of Lead , and nine Bagges of powder . " He was a landmark and a tradition , he was even  --  and this was an ever-present ant in the Squire 's pants  --  a member of the Sacred Camels of King Menelik  --  duly elected in a moment of dromedarian alcoholic conviviality  --  which the latter was not . The Van Dorn place , described as " four acres , more or less , with the dwelling thereon , " upon which Mason had recently foreclosedthe mortgage and of which the sale had been ordered for the following week , had been the actual site of King Wagamoc 's wigwam , and the old sachem 's well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after three hundred years . Some of the inhabitants could even remember when their neighbors regularly drew their water from it before the pipes from Turtle Pond had been laid , back in 1871 . The tiny Dutch farmhouse with curving eaves stood back some distance from the road , and , as he had expected , his quarry , a slim girl with yellow hair and cornflower eyes , was weeding in the garden beyond the well . Hearing his steps , she stood up as if to intercept his approach to the house . " Afternoon , Tess , " he said , without removing his hat . " I 'm a hard feller to beat  --  a regular sticker . It ai n't too late to fix things up , if you say the word . " " After what you 've done , I should think you 'd be ashamed to show your face around here , " she answered contemptuously . " What have I done ? A contract 's a contract , ai n't it ? This is another matter "  | " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " she cried , clenching her trowel and taking a step toward him . " Go away ! " Instinctively the squire moved backward . There was a splinteringsound , an oath , a crash , a smothered yell . Tess screamed and threw herself on her knees at the well 's edge . Fifteen feet below , the squire was clutching and floundering , his derby hat floating upside down beside him . " Help ! I 'm drowning ! " he spluttered , his face an agonized spot of white . " Throw me a rope or get a ladder , quick ! " " Ding dong bell ! Squire 's in the well ! " caroled Tess ' small sister , Peggy , dancing hilariously around the curb . " Serves him right , the nasty old man ! Ding dong bell ! Squire 's in the well ! " A group of small boys took up the cry , pedestrians came flocking , the fire bell began to ring , and in no time at all a jostling crowd was directing sarcastic witticisms at the unfortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladder was lowered , and Mason , with such dignity as he could assume , climbed out , dripping , amid the jeers of his fellow townsmen . Scowling and without a word of thanks for their assistance , he scuffed the green scum from his boots , wrung out the tails of his cutaway , clapped on his soaked hat and hurried toward the square , leaving a watery trail behind him . Once more , in retreat , he passed King Wagamoc . " Filthy old redskin , " he muttered . " Some night I 'll take ye out and burn ye . " A few days after the squire 's mishap , Mr. Ephraim Tutt , after a long absence from Pottsville , was driving up from the depot to the Phoenix Hotel when his taxi was blocked by a surging mob in front of the courthouse . At the top of the steps stood Sheriff Moses Higgins , flanked onone side by Mason and on the other by a group consisting of Tessp192Van Dorn , a towheaded youth in an olive-drab uniform , and a freckled little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheriff . " Three thousand dollars once . . . three thousand dollars twice . . . three thousand dollars third and last time "  --  he hesitated  --  " and sold to Hezekiah Ma-son ! " The soldier walked over and shook his fist in the squire 's bearded face . " If my furlough was n't over tomorrow , " he said , " I 'd knock your block off ! " " Do it now , Tom ! " urged those on the steps . " Soak him ! " " No dice ! But when I come back " Ptah ! " ejaculated Mason . " I 've bought in this property accordin ' to law . Lay a finger on me and I 'll hey the sheriff arrest ye fer assault . " Then , amid boos from the crowd , he ducked quickly behind a pillar and slipped into the courthouse . " What 's Mason been up to this time ? " asked Mr. Tutt of old Dan Stebbins , his driver . " Damnedest trick on record ! I did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid his interest regular as clockwork  --  ninety dollars a quarter  --  out of his fireman 's pension . He bought the place for nine thousand , put up three thousandcash he 'd saved and give a purchase-money mortgage at six per cent for the balance . Then the depression come along and the squire managed to buy the mortgage for half price from the feller that owned it . It had five more years to run , but last June Dirk defaulted on the interest , and now the squire 's grabbed it . " " You mean Dirk could n't raise ninety dollars ? " " Sure he could . Had the money right in the squire 's own bank . Dirk give his check to little Peggy on the due date  --  he did n't like to send Tess down to the bank because of the squire 's way ofp193makin ' up to her-and told her to pay him and git his receipt . Well , the kid no sooner got onto the street than a motorcar knocked her over and she was in the hospital for three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the check until Peg was brought home and they found it in her pocket . That was exactly twenty-one days after the interest was due . Tess took it right over to Mason , but , by heck , he refused it and begun foreclosureproceedings . " " Did n't the court take into consideration the circumstances surrounding the default ? " " Judge Tompkins held they did n't make no difference . Said he was sorry , but that the law was settled and he did n't have no choice . " Ma Best greeted Mr. Tutt warmly on the veranda of the Phoenix House , where the Van Dorns had already sought asylum . Dirk Van Dorn , a heavily built man with a shock of white hair capping his rugged , honest face , was sitting in a wheel chair by the door . Mr. Tutt patted him on the shoulder . " Do n't lose courage , Dirk . Maybe we can beat the squire yet . " Ma followed him inside . " If you 'd only got here sooner ! " she lamented . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes out . There ai n't a finer man in the world than Dirk Van Dorn . As for Tess , I love her like she was my own . She and Tom Ridgeway  --  himas ran the filling station  --  make as nice a couple as you ever see . Tom 's number was called up last year , but , after he 'd served six months at Camp Stewart , he was discharged as overage and put on the reserve list . So he come back and started up his business again , and he and Tess had it all planned to be married next month . Everything looked fine . Then the squire got his foreclosure , Tom was called back into the Army on practically no notice , and now they 've lost their home . "  | " Why should Mason want to take over the place if he was getting twelve per cent on his investment ? " he asked . " He 's plannin ' to put up a big building to house the overflow of employees from the new Government munitions works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room left over there , and that a lot of ' em are livin ' in tents . It 's only seven miles away , and the Van Dorn corner is an ideal site . He 's going to call it Mason Terrace . " Mr. Tutt carried his dunnage upstairs , lit a stogie and sat down by the window . He had known Van Dorn for years , first as a boy in Pottsville and later on in New York , where he had joined the fire department . The old lawyer had often strolled around to the hook-and-ladder house on Tenth Avenue to chat with the big , good-natured driver , and knew his whole story ; how there had been Van Dorns in the Mohawk Valley for more than two centuries , how they had gradually been forced to sell their land , and how Dirk , the last of the line , had sought his fortune in the city . There he had married , had two children and managed to save a little money , but he had always yearned to go back to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up kids . Then Fate had dealt him two heavy blows . First his wife had died , and , six months later , he had crashed his truck against an elevated pillar in order to avoid running over a child , and it had been necessary to amputate his leg . The twelve-year old Tess was then but a yellow cowslip of a girl , and Peggy just able to run around by herself , with no one to look after either of them . The only silver lining to the cloud had been that , retired on half pay , Dirk had been able to go back to Pottsville , where , regarded as a minor hero , he had been fortunate in being able to buy back the homesteadthat had belonged to his family from 1751 to 1859 . The squire had well known that Dirk had had more than enough money on deposit to pay his interest and exactly why he had forgotten to do so . He had deliberately let the default occur and the twenty days ' grace run out.  |p195Mr  . Tutt sat smoking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the squire secured his judgment of foreclosure , it would have been useless to appeal . The Court of Appeals had repeated again and again what it had said in the famous case of Graff versus The Hope Building Corporation in 254 N. Y. I : " In the absence of fraud , bad faith or unconscionable conduct , a mortgagee is entitled to enforce a covenant in the mortgage that after default of twenty days in the payment of any installmentof interest , the principal sum shall become due . . . . Stabilityof contract obligations can not be undermined by judicial sympathy . " The shadows crept across the road , cowbells tolled the knell of parting day from the fields behind the hotel , and the rumbling roar of Ma Best 's brass gong called him to supper . Tess was biddingfarewell to Tom Ridgeway on the porch when he came down . Her yellow hair matched his uniform and the orange flecks in his eyes . " Good-by , sir , " said the young man with a laugh . " Keep an eye on my girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't let her marry Squire Mason ! " The old man 's heart was stirred . " If there 's a God in heaven , I 'll find some way to bring that skunk to justice ! " he assured them . Hezekiah Mason was not the man to allow a matrimonial repulseto curdle the satisfaction of his material success or to interfere with his business . Within a week , his excavators and bulldozerswere hard at work ; the well had been filled in and capped ; the foundations had been dug and the stringcourscs laid . Soon five stories had been run up , and Mason , who was his own contractor , had moved in , sleeping on a cot in an unfurnished room over the entrance , so as to be sure that the men got to work on time . Mr. Tutt watched the building 's progress with growing rage.  | The sight of Dirk hobbling about the village square on his crutches while the squire lorded it over the Van Dorn demesne was more than he could stand . Passing King Wagamoc in front of Colson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white successors , much to the aborigine 's advantage . Wagamoc had been a good old skate , well deserving his honorary membership in the Sacred Camels of King Menelik . Charlie Colson , a watery-eyed little man in a topless straw hat resembling a bedraggled halo , emerged from his store just as the squire appeared around the corner . " That eyesore ought to be chucked in the town dump , " scowled Mason , indicating the Indian . " I 'll give ye five dollars fer it , jest to git the durn thing out of sight . " It was sacrilege , but Mr. Tutt knew that Colson 's creditors were hard upon his heels . " You must n't sell King Wagamoc , Charlie ! " he interposed . " He 's a village institution . Do n't forget that he 's an honorary Sacred Camel . " " Give ye ten ! " tempted the squire . Mr. Colson rubbed his bristly chin . " I reckon he 's worth more than that , " he hesitated . " Well , it 's throwin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit , I 'll make it fifteen . " Mr. Tutt could see that the storekeeper was weakening . " Rather than have King Wagamoc removed , I 'll give you twentyfivedollars , " he said . The squire puckered his lips . " All nonsense ! I 'll give ye thirty . " " No , you do n't , Squire ! " countered Mr. Tutt . " King Wagamoc is an old friend of mine . Fifty ! " " Sold ! " exclaimed Mr. Colson excitedly . " Ptah ! " snorted Mason , and strode away toward his bank . Mr. Tutt counted out the bills and sat down on the edge ofp197the horse trough . Poor old Wagamoc ! How he had been trimmed . A hundred and twenty-eight square miles of the best land in the Mohawk Valley for a measly bunch of wampum , half a dozen old coats and some powder and lead . He had been gypped just as Mason had been gypping the subsequent owners ever since . " They sure did you dirt , brother ! " he remarked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few scalps . Anyhow , you 're a heap big Indian . " And he lifted his finger to the brim of his chimneypothat in salute . It may have been a purely optical illusion , or even some trick of the imagination , but at that instant Mr. Tutt could have sworn that King Wagamoc winked his right eye . The chieftain 's shaded glance and uplifted tomahawk seemed to point directly at the registry office . It was almost as if Wagamoc , outraged at the skulduggeryby which the squire had acquired the land upon which his wigwam had once stood , was bent upon revenge . " Say , Mose ! " called Mr. Tutt to the sheriff , who was loitering on the courthouse steps . " Where would you say old Wagamoc was pointing ? " Mr. Higgins cocked his straw-colored thatch . " I should say he was pintin ' straight at Ezry Bodman 's bald spot over thar in the window , " he replied . It was one of those mornings when the smell of earth fills the humid air , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water the May flies are dancing out their few short hours of life , to vanish on the morrow . All Nature tugged at the old man 's coattails , telling him to rig his rod , don his waders and breast the chuckling eddies of Chasm Brook . Today the trout would rise as they might never rise again . In imagination he could see the swirl and feel the heavy drag on his line . This was the moment for which he had worked and waited during the past long months . There would not be many such days left to him . Then he saw Tess waving at him from the hotel veranda . " I 've just had a radio from Tom ! " she cried ecstatically . " I do n't know where it came from , but he 's all right ! Is n't it won-derful ? " The squire was just vanishing into the bank . " To hell with fishing ! " growled Mr. Tutt . " I 'll get that scalawag , if I do n't catch another trout all summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising in every brook , Mr. Tutt sat in his shirt sleeves straining his eyes over the faded records in the registry office . Step by step he traced the chain of title of the property back through Beazeleys , Updykes , Sutphens and Kosters to the Van Dorns . Often the handwritingwas so faint and yellow as to be almost undecipherable , yet painstakingly , with the aid of a reading glass , he studied every word , piling the ancient tomes upon the floor about him until they were waist high . Late one afternoon , when he was thinking what an old goat he was to do all over again what others had presumably done better before him , he started , rubbed first his eyes and then his spectacles , bent again to the page , and sprang to his feet amid an explosion of dust . " What 's the matter ? " inquired Mr. Bodman . " Hez a rat bitye ? " " No ! " said Mr. Tutt . " But I think I 've caught a rat ! " Striding elatedly across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colson 's , he slapped him affectionately upon the rump . " Chief , " he cried , " you sure gave me a hot tip ! They also serve who only stand and wait . ' " " How long since you 've taken any water from King Wagamoc'swell ? " he asked Ma Best casually at dinner.  | " A couple of months . I make my tonic out of it . " " May I have some ? " " It 's all used up , " answered Ma . " Ezra Bodman took the last I had yesterday . I ca n't make it out of the town water , and the squire 's plugged up the well . " " Maybe he 's piped it into the building . " " I never thought of that , " she said . " Maybe he has . I 'll go down there after supper and see . " The squire was smoking a cigar on a pile of lumber when Ma Best came along with her pail . " Good evenin ' , Hezekiah , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , please ? " " Ai n't no water here . It 's not turned on yet . What 's the matter with your own hotel water ? " " I need well water . It has somethin ' special in it . They say that was why King Wagamoc chose this spot for his wigwam . " " To hell with King Wagamoc ! " said Mason . " The well 's out of business for keeps . " Three mornings later , aroused by the six-o'clock whistle , the squire climbed down his ladder to find a smartly dressed young man loitering outside . " Good morning , Mr. Mason , " chirped Bonnie Doon . " Would you mind accepting service of these papers ? " They were a summons and complaint in an action of ejectment brought against him by Dirk Van Dorn , with an injunction pendente lite signed by Judge Tompkins , prohibiting him from altering the property in any way , removing any of the fixtures thereon , or otherwise diminishing its value until final determinationof the title . " Pish posh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as good as wheat . I got judgment in foreclosure , the time for appeal expired , and I bought in the property . Old Tutt must be crazy . "  |p200Bonnie  Doon regarded the squire almost tenderly . Coming close to his hairy ear , he leaned over and whispered , " I 'll tell you a secret , squire . He is . " Mason , who regarded himself as the best lawyer in Patterson County , knew it must be all poppycock . The whole thing was fixed , settled , res adjudicate and everything else having to do with legal finality . The papers did n't even allege a cause of action . As for the title , it had been searched over and over again so thoroughly that , if a piece of property were known to have been part of the Van Dorn-Koster grant of 1857 , no one ever took the trouble to look further . So the squire calmly went on with his building ; another fortnight and Mason Terrace would be ready for occupancy . Meantime the September term of the Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of the calendar , and Tom Ridgeway , lean and tanned , unexpectedly turned up in town on furlough . " Wanted to see what care you 've been taking of my girl ! " he grinned over Tess ' shoulder . " She 's prettier than when I went away . " " She ought to be , " returned the old man . " She 's spoiled my fishing . . . . By the way , Peggy , do you want to help me with a paint job that requires especial artistic talent ? " Squire Mason had just kicked off his boots , blown out his candle and lowered himself gingerly into his cot when from Hibbard'sLiquor Store across the way came an unmistakable Indian war whoop  --  a series of war whoops . Arising in his stocking feet , he shuffled to the window . A crowd of men was gathered in front of the saloon around King Wagamoc , who had been dragged over from the square and now faced directly toward him under the electric light . CouldKING WAGAMOC 'S REVENGE godp201they be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burn his building ? He had twice been dumped in the village horse trough and once ridden on a rail by outraged inhabitants , and each time they had started by getting blotto at Hibbard 's . He did n't like the look of it . Quickly the squire rolled a barrel of cement against the patched-up door of boards . Then he exhaled a sigh of relief  --  nothing to be skeered of , after all . Music , not murder , was in the air . From beneath the window arose a discordant chorus of barbershopchords , in which he recognized the voices of Cy Pennypacker , Mose Higgins , Sam Bellows and Toggery Bill Gookin . " How dry I a-a-am ! How dry I a-a-am ! Nobody kno-ows how dry I a-a-am ! " wailed the official quartet of the Sacred Camels of King Menelik . " Plastered , every mother 's son of ' cm ! " he told himself . " The o-old oaken buck-et , the i-ron bound buck-et , the moss-covered bu-u-cket that hangs in the well ! " quavered the quartet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by savage ululations from the vicinity of King Wagamoc . Only as dawn broke over the Broadalbin Hills did it die away . But even then the squire slept not . Could old Tutt be up to something ? His question was answered at ten o'clock next morning when he entered the Supreme Court and found it so jammed that only with difficulty could he force his way to the rail where Dirk Van Dorn , in his wheel chair , Tess and Tom Ridgeway and little Peggy were clustered about the old lawyer . Judge Tompkins was already on hand , a row of carefully marked law reports arrayed before him . " Van Dorn versus Mason . If both sides are ready , you may proceed . " Mr. Tutt slowly unjointed his long form . There was an expres/sion of amused confidence on his withered face that the squire did not like . " This is an action in ejectment based on a right of re-entry for condition broken , " he stated simply . " I shall call only three witnesses . . . . Mrs. Best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her best Sunday clothes , bobbed to Judge Tompkins and proudly ascended the dais . " Are you a citizen of Pottsville ? " asked Mr. Tutt . " I certainly am . I was born in this town sixty-five years ago and I 've been on the votin ' list ever since the Nineteenth Amend-ment . " " Are you familiar , Mrs. Best , " Mr. Tutt said , " with the well on the corner of Main and Walnut streets known as King Wagamoc'swell ? " " Yes , indeed , " she said . " When I was a girl we always drew our water there , until they piped it into town from Turtle Pond . " " How often recently have you made use of it ? " " Every few weeks . The Wagamoc water is heaps softer than Turtle Pond . I make my tonic with it . " " Your what ? " demanded his honor . " My tonic , " Ma said . " I make it from my Grandmother Perkins ' receipt . There 's lots of folks use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugstore patent medicine ! " cackled Ezra from his seat . " I start in takin ' it right along every April --  " " Better save your testimonial until it 's put on the market , Mr. Bodman , " smiled Judge Tompkins . " We 'll pass up the tonic for the time being . " " The tonic may prove to be important , " chuckled Mr. Tutt . . . . " Now , Mrs. Best , on the twenty-first of last August did you attempt to go to King Wagamoc 's well and draw some water ? "   " I sure did . Of course , I knew the squire had blocked it up and built all over it , but I got my bucket and went down . HezekiahMason was settin ' there smokin ' a cigar , and I asked him if he would let me fill my pail . He said that the well was plugged up for keeps and that I 'd never be able to get any more water there . " " Thank you , Mrs. Best , " nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Mason ? " " I move to strike it all out , on the ground that it 's irrelevant , incompetent and immaterial and has nothing to do with the case ! " said Mason . " I 'll let it stand , squire , " replied judge Tompkins innocently . " Perhaps Mr. Tutt can connect it in some way . " " I shall , " declared the old lawyer . " Dirk Van Dorn , please come up here to the stand . " The courtroom was hushed as the ex-fireman swung himself up to the witness chair by means of his crutches . " Are you and your two daughters the sole living descendants of Dirk Van Dorn , grantee from the heirs of Arendt Van Corlear of the four acres of land now forming the corner of Main and Walnutstreets under deed dated May 3 , 1751 , and of the later Dirk Van Dorn , who deeded that same parcel in 1857 to Girard Koster ? " " I am , " answered the witness . " Dirk Van Dorn was my greatgrandfather . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the family . " " If you have any doubt as to that , squire , I will gladly submit further proof . I have it all here at hand , " said Mr. Tutt . . . . " Now , Mr. Bodman ! " And old Ezra , clasping a heavy volume to his bosom , climbed shakily to the stand . " Have you the record of the deed from Dirk Van Dorn to Girard Koster of August 1 , 1857 ? " asked Mr. Tutt . Old Ezra placed the book carefully on his knees , opened it and adjusted his spectacles . " I have , right here . "   " Kindly read to his honor the terms on which Van Dorn granted the land to Koster . " " The deed reads : To all Christian people to whom this deed of sale shall come : I , Dirk Van Dorn , of the town of Pottsville  --  and so forth  --  do hereby grant unto the said Jacob de Groot , his heirs and assigns forever , all that parcel of land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have and to hold , so long as the said Koster , his heirs and assigns allow the free and unrestricted use by the citizens of said town of the well situated thereon , known as King Wagamoc 's well , upon condition that if their use of said well is ever denied or obstructed , then this grant to be void and of no effect , and the said premises to revert to me and the heirs of my body . ' " The squire had turned the color of cheese . Gripping the arms of his chair , he tried ineffectually to rise . " Even if there is such a clause in the deed , it do n't affect my title to the property , " he said thickly . " If it has any significance at all , it 's only a covenant running with the land . All I 've got to do is to unstop the well . " " Oh , no , squire ! " retorted Mr. Tutt . " The deed provides for a direct reversion of title if the condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running with the land . It is an absolute contract  --  like an agreement to pay the interest on a mortgage upon a day certain . The law is definitely settled by Savings Bank versus Roxbury Home for Aged Women , 244 Mass. 583 , and Post versus Weil , 115 New York 361 . They are directly in point . While courts , as a rule , do n't favor forfeitures "  --  he winked at Judge Tompkins  --  " I fancy they 'd like this one . " " But any right the general public might have had to draw water out of that well was abandoned seventy years ago , when the town put in its own supply ! " insisted Mason . " The fact that one old woman occasionally made tonic out of it do n't amount to a hill of beans . "   " It 's quite a hill , " countered the judge , who seemed to be enjoyingthe squire 's discomfiture . " This was n't an easement acquiredby prescription which could be lost by abandonment . It was an absolute condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including yourself , by breaking which you forfeitedany right you may have acquired in the land . " He cleared his throat and glanced significantly over the crowded benches in the courtroom . " Hezekiah Mason , " he said slowly , " six months ago in this very room you secured a judgment of foreclosure upon this same property , on the ground that the present plaintiff , Dirk Van Dorn , had technically defaulted in his interest  --  although you knew that the only reason for the default was that his child , who was bringing you the money , had been nearly killed in an automobileaccident , and although he tendered it to you within a few hours after the expiration of the twenty-day period of grace . Like Shylock , you insisted on having your pound of flesh ; unlike Shylock , you got it , because even equity , which is supposed to be that which is right and fair , but too often is not , gave it to you . I have known of many despicable wrongs done under color of law , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the greatest possible pleasure to return this land to its former owner together with whatever improvements you have made upon it . " " But you ca n't deprive me of my buildings without compensation ! " gasped Squire Mason . " Its ' contrary to the doctrine of unjust enrichment ! It ai n't equity ! " " Who are you to talk of equity ? " returned his honor . " You have got precisely what you deserved . judgment for the plaintiff . " There was an outburst of applause and a stampede toward the rail to congratulate Dirk . Tess threw her arms around Mr. Tuft 's neck . " How can we thank you ? " she cried . " By marrying Tom Ridgeway as soon as you can , " he replied " I 've arranged with Judge Tompkins for waiver of the usual notice . All your father will have to do now is to change the name of the apartment house and open it for business . " Squire Hezekiah Mason gathered up his papers and slunk out . As he pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of the steps by the effigy of good King Wagamoc , upon whose ordinarily enigmatical features someone had freshly painted a grin of sardonic triumph . P207MR . TUTT , to avoid some dangerous-looking rapids , climbed the wooded hill that rose sharply from the river bank . Fly-rod in hand he struggled through the underbrush , catching his hip boots in vines and creepers , until he emerged unexpectedly into a magnificent grove of oaks overlooking the Rappahannock Valley with the spires of Fredericksburg in the distance . Just below him a tonsured brown skull , encircled by a coronet of white wool , was bobbing up and down to the accompaniment of a spade in an excavation among the trees . A queer place to dig , he thought ! Then through the ivy-clad trunks he caught sight of a square red-brick house with massive chimneys half covered by wisteria , which rose out of the sea of yellow jonquils surroundingit like an enchanted island of the forgotten past . The jonquils growing everywhere in thousands glittered like gold in the late afternoon sun . Wading knee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the house . The walls were cracked and weather stained , the pillars of the veranda out of plumb , and the shutters slightly awry , but it had a dignity and refinementthat reflected , he felt sure , the generations of gentlefolk who had lived there . Not a magni Pico of the tidewater , but of the upland and the farm  --  a typical mansion of the Old South . As he reached the corner a ferret-faced man was just climbing into a motor car on the unkempt circle . Beside it stood a slender , blond young woman , with finely cut features , whose bearing , in spite of her well-worn dress , showed that she was the mistress of the place , if not of the situation . For some reason the man in the car seemed to resent her presence . Thrusting his head out of   the window , he said roughly : " Well , that 's all there is to it . You 've had your notice . You must be out in a week 's time  --  or else ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment the girl looked after it , her face white and tragic , then turned and moved slowly towards the door unconscious of the old man 's presence until he raised his hat . " I fear I am trespassing on your property , " he said , " but I 'm absolutely lost . Could you put me on the road to Fredericksburg  --  and perhaps give me a glass of water ? My name is Ephraim Tutt . I am from New York . " " New York ! " she murmured bitterly . Then she pulled herself together and forced a smile . " Certainly ! Wo n't you come in and rest ? It 's three miles to town .  --  I am Ann Claiborne . My husband , Monroe Claiborne , is away in the service . " She ushered him up the sagging steps of the veranda , through a hall paneled in mahogany , and into a high-celled drawingroomhung with faded portraits . The floors were bereft of paint and the walls dingy , but it had a benign distinction in keeping with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , " she said . " You will have to excuse me for a moment . " Mr. Tutt sank into a high-backed chair and looked about him . On an ancient square piano stood the photograph of a handsome officer in the uniform of a lieutenant-commander . Over the perfectAdam mantel was the portrait of a charming woman in tight silk bodice , lace cap and fichu , to whom Mrs. Claiborne bore a noticeable resemblance . She returned in a few minutes carrying a tray on which , in addition to the glass of water , was a bottle of blackberry wine and a piece of angel cake . " I 'm sorry I ca n't offer you anything better ! " she apologized , filling the two wine glasses and offering him one .   " Your husband ? " he asked , indicating the photograph . " Yes , he 's been in the South Pacific nearly three years . He 's hoping for leave next month . " " To him  --  and all the others ! " said Mr. Tutt . The understanding and sympathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this almost uncouth old man did not seem a stranger at all , but more like a friend . Her eyes filled and she hastily put down her glass . " You must forgive me ! " she said . " But I 've just had a terrible shock . You see , I have been trying to run the farm as well as I could until the war should be over and Monroe got back , but apparently the house has been sold over our heads . That man you saw driving away was Mr. Simmons , a local lawyer who says he represents the purchaser in New York . I have to be out in a week . " " Then you do not own it ? " " No . Under my grandfather 's will , after the death of my father and mother , it went to my brother Shirley . He was an undisciplinedboy , and mother , who was a widow , had a hard time bringing him up , but he always said that if he did n't marry the place should be mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband and me to stay on with her . She died a few months later and Shirley , who had always found life too tame for him here , took what there was in the bank and disappeared . Then came Pearl Harbor , my husband volunteered and I stayed on alone and took care of the place . I have only heard from Shirleyonce since he went away . That was last winter when he telegraphedme from New York that he needed money . But I had none to send him . I heard later that he had been drafted . Now , of course , I know that he was in a scrape . Simmons hinted that it was something discreditable , and I 'm afraid it was . " " I 've seen many beautiful old mansions in the neighborhood , P210but nothing to equal this one , " Mr. Tutt assured her . " It would be a shame to have it pass out of your family . " " I 'm glad you like it , " she responded . " I 'd love to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made right on the place in 1735 . There used to be ten thousand acres , but now there are only one hundred . It 's called Ophir Plantation . " Mr. Tutt followed her to the veranda . " From where you stand you can see over five counties , " she continued . " Spotsylvania , Westmoreland , Stafford , Caroline and King George . It was from here that Governor Spottswood  --  a connectionof our family  --  started on his famous trip over the mountainswith The Knights of the Golden Horse-shoe . ' General Washington , when he visited his mother or his sister Betty Lewis in Fredericksburg , used to ride over often . The hill itself , as you probably know , was the left anchor of General Lee 's line during the battles fought at Fredericksburg in the Civil War . He came here almost every day on his horse Traveller . ' The Confederate trenches below the terraces , while overgrown , are still clearly visible . There 's a tree trunk down there which was shattered by a Federal cannonball on December 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Negro is doing not digging for relics , is he ? " " Not Civil War relics , " she smiled . " Uncle Peter is looking for gold . There has always been a tradition that back in the early days a Spanish pirate settled on this hill in the oak grove . Every week when he went down to the settlement to buy what he needed he paid with a gold doubloon . The people on the place  --  mostly the children  --  have dug there for over two hundred years . They have never found anything except nails , hinges and bolts , but Uncle Peter is very persistent , due to a vision his wife , Aunt Sukey , is supposed to have had . The night she died over in the quarters , although she was very weak , she raised herselfP211in bed and said : Oh , Marse Shirley . I can see the Pirate 's Gold . Let me take you to it before I go . ' My father naturally would n't allow her to get up and she passed away without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Uncle Peter digs every spare minute he can get . I must say some of that gold would come in very handy ! " Mr. Tutt waved his hand towards the thousands of jonquils . " The gold seems to be right on the surface ! " he said . " Yes ! Is n't it all too lovely ! " she sighed . " It will break my heart to leave it ! And to have strangers living here to whom it will mean so little ! " They crossed the lawn to the drive winding down the hill . In the shade of a grape arbor a yellow-haired child was playing with a coal-black pickaninny . " That 's my two-year-old daughter Shirley . Her father has never seen her ! " said Ann . And then to the small Negro : " Make a curtsy for Mr. Tutt , Scarlet ! " " Scarlet ? " " Scarlet O'Hara '  --  she 's Uncle Peter 's great-grandchild . They insisted on calling her that . Melissa , her mother , is my only servant . " Scarlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Scarlet , Melissa and Uncle Peter if the place is sold ? " asked Mr. Tutt . " Heaven knows ! " she replied , adding : " Or where I shall go myself . " " May I ask who has bought the place from your brother ? " " A Mr. Powell  --  a New York stock broker . According to Ralph Simmons he plans to restore ' it ! " " Heaven forbid ! " exclaimed the old man . " Restoration is usually a synonym for atrocity ! " He smiled thoughtfully . " Might I have another piece of that delicious cake ? "  | " Of course you may  --  It 's a compliment . I made it . " They went back to the drawing room . " I do n't know this Mr. Powell , " said Mr. Tutt , " but it seems to me possible that , if he were fully informed of all the circumstances , he might be persuaded to take a more friendly attitude . We Northerners are n't as bad as we 're sometimes painted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the estate to him may in some way be open to question . One can never be sure about such things . " " I 'm afraid there is nothing that can be done , " she returned . " Shirley owned the property under my grandfather 's will . He has deeded it to Mr. Powell , and Mr. Powell has ordered me to vacateit . " " If it were my land I would want to look at both will and deed : I should also like to talk to Mr. Simmons and check on his authority to act : And finally I should try to interview Mr. Powell , and make sure that he really understood the situa-tion . " " What you say seems reasonable , " she answered . " But I have no money to pay a lawyer . In any case , I should hate the publicityof legal proceedings . It is easier to let it go and not bring Shirley 's name into it . " " I appreciate your feeling about your brother , but I do n't see why the reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the rest , I am an attorney and should be glad to look into the facts and act as your legal representative  --  simply for my own satisfaction . " Mrs. Claiborne sat silently for several seconds . From the windowcame the drone of insects , the scent of honeysuckle , and the babblings of little Shirley and Scarlet . The light reflected through the open doors from the jonquil-covered terrace tinted the ceiling with gold . She looked at the portraits of her great/grandmother over the mantelpiece , and then at the photograph of her husband , who was so soon to be coming home . If this old man , though he were a stranger , could save it for them  --  but that was nonsense ! Still it would do no harm to let him try . " If you care to do so , I shall be very grateful , " she said . For two hundred feet the once trim but now abandoned terracesdescended to the river . The rains of many years had torn the drive into a narrow gully , so that below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across which the gate-posts canted askew . Looking back Mr. Tutt could sec the figure of Ann Claiborne standing on the veranda beside two white dots . " If there 's a way I 'll find it ! " he muttered . The old lawyer , who had made Fredericksburg his headquartersduring a tour of the Virginia battlefields , had already fallen under the spell of the famous old town . Nowhere before had he been so conscious of the continuity of America 's history  --  of the nearness of the past , of the living influence of men whom he had hitherto vaguely regarded as merely traditional figures . He had expected that as a " Yankee , " he would be treated with at least a certain degree of coldness , but from the moment he registered at the old-fashioned Princess Anne Hotel on the Main Street he had been made absolutely at home . Here on the site of one of the bitterest battles of the Civil War , surrounded by memorials to the Confederate and Federal dead , there was no longer any feeling of " North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were fighting side by side in Normandy and the Carolines with those from the Green Mountains and the islands of the Maine coast . The cafeterias and movie houses overflowed with men in uniform from Quantico and Camp Dahlgren , all anxious to see the simple dwelling of Washington 's mother , the stately mansion of his sisterwho had married Col. Fielding Lewis  --  box-bordered " Ken- more "  --  and the " Rising Sun " tavern where the fathers of the Revolution had foregathered . Fredericksburg was still full of the descendants of the Washingtons , Mercers , Fitzhughs , Lewises and Lees , and Mr. Tutt had gained instant popularity by calling attention to the heretofore apparently overlooked fact that in the stained-glass window in the chancel of old St. George 's Church the artist , perhaps unconsciously , had made the face of the ApostlePeter to resemble strikingly that of General Robert E. Lee . " What a compliment to Uncle Robert ! " the General 's greatgrandniecehad exclaimed delightedly to Mr. Tutt one night at dinner . " On the contrary , what a compliment to St. Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of a person is this Ralph Simmons , the lawyer ? " he asked the proprietor of the Princess Anne . " He 's what we call white trash ! " replied his host . " Better look out for him ! " Hence Mr. Tutt was not surprised when on his visit later that evening Mr. Simmons did not arise from where he was reclining on his piazza or invite him to be seated . " My name is Tutt , " he introduced himself . " I am a lawyer from New York . I have come to ask you a few questions about Ophir Plantation . " " What do you want to know ? " " For one thing , why it should be necessary to oust on a week 's notice a lady who has lived there all her life and by what right you are trying to do so ? " Mr. Simmons , who did not like Northerners  --  or many Southernerseither  --  spat over the rail . " How do you come into it ? " he inquired rudely . " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , you 've got nothing to represent . The place belonged to her brother and he 's sold it . She has no right there and my client wants possession . " " Do n't you think that he could be persuaded to let her stay on awhile  --  at least for the duration ? " " No . He 's a rich man and he wants it for a country place . He 's going to start restoration as soon as he arrives next week . " " What is his name ? " " Mr. Clayton Powell  --  he 's a broker in New York . " " Saunders &; Powell ? " " That 's the firm . Shirley Claiborne trimmed ' em out of a pile of money and assigned everything he had in settlement to avoid trouble . He 's no good and his sister had better keep still about the whole thing for the sake of the family name . " " How did he acquire title ? " " By his grandfather 's will . " " May I see it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Clerk 's Office . " " Thank you ! " replied Mr. Tutt , who itched to punch Mr. Simmons ' nose . " You may be sure that I shall .  --  Good night ! " He walked slowly back along the maple-shaded street to the Princess Anne . " Ophir Plantation ' ? " answered his friend the proprietor to his question as to the Claiborne place . " It 's the finest old estate above tidewater . Claiborne is a great name in these parts . The first Claiborne came to Virginia in 16o8 . There 's a plaque to his memory in the old church at Jamestown  --  next to that of Pocahontas . He held an immense grant of land here direct from the Crown . Chatham , ' just across the river , where George Washingtoncourted Martha Custis and General Burnside had his headquartersduring the Civil War , is part of it , and there 's still a stream known as Claiborne 's Run ' over there .   " Shirley is another family name and a Shirley Claiborne either male or female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line for over two hundred years . Most of them have been soldiers , too , except this present scamp . There was a General Shirley Claiborne on Washington 's staff , another was killed at Chapultepecand still another at Gettysburg . Ann 's grandfather was one of Roosevelt 's Rough Riders and her father was a Colonel of Artillery in France during the First World War . And every one of ' em born up on the hill ! " The Colonel came back here after the Armistice , married Ann Spottswood of Stafford , and had two children  --  Ann and Shirley . His father the Rough Rider died before the first child was born . Under his will the place went eventually to the boy . Ann married a distant cousin  --  also a Claiborne , so she did n't have to alter her name . Colonel Claiborne had passed on by that time , so his widow and the others all lived on there together . Ann 's mother died three years ago . Shirley , who had always been the bad boy of Fredericksburg , vamoosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ann 's been struggling to hold down the place ever since . She 's had a hard time , but once the war is over and her husband comes back I guess they 'll pull out all right . It 's good rich land . " " You 've heard about the Pirate 's gold ? " asked Mr. Tutt . " That old story ? Sure ! There is n't a yard of that hill that has n't been dug over . The only one who believes it is Uncle Peter  --  and he 's so old that he 's half cracked . " " Well , gold is where you find it , ' " asserted Mr. Tutt . Next morning the old lawyer was at the Court House as soon as the doors were unlocked and within ten minutes was reading the duly recorded will of Shirley Claiborne , the Rough Rider , by which the testator devised " Ophir Plantation " to " My son Shirley for his life , and at his death to his wife Ann Spottswood , P2I7if she be then living , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall outlive the other leaving issue , then I give and devise said estate in its entirety to whichever grandchild of mine shall be named Shirley . " Lighting a stogie he sat down on the Court House steps . There certainly was nothing ambiguous about that ! It was clear as a bell . The Colonel , in spite of the abolition of the laws against primogeniture and entail , had intended that , God willing , " Ophir Plantation " should always and forever belong to a Shirley Claiborne . He did n't blame him , considering the splendid record of those previous Shirleys , but it certainly was tough on Ann , and the worthy Colonel would undoubtedly writhe in his grave at the thought of a Wall Street stock broker becoming lord of the manor . Yet , obviously , there was no one to blame but the testator himself and equally there was nothing to be done about it . Mr. Ralph Simmons would get a fat fee , Powell would turn some landscape architect loose and a charming old house would be transformed into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and an English butler . " God willing ? " It looked as if God would n't have much to say about it ! Mr. Tutt was absolutely stymied . He had been stumped before plenty of times in his long career , but he had never felt quite so badly about it  --  just why he could n't tell . This lovely young woman struggling alone to preserve her family 's historic mansion appealed to his sense of chivalry . But there was more to it than that . He had come to love the South with all the fine qualities of gentility and courage which Ann Claiborne personified . A place like " Ophir " in the hands of the rightful owners could not but have a far-reaching influence upon the local community and indirectlyupon the whole United States . It was , or at least would be as long as it remained untouched , a monument to what had been the best in American life . It must not pass into alien hands !   He would fight to preserve it by every means at his command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did he have ? None that he could see except to challenge every alleged fact , no matter how thinly established it might seem . Undoubtedly if the person who had transferred " Ophir Plantation " to broker Powell was a grandson of the testator and in fact named Shirley he could give a clear title . Well , first of all , was he ? The old man arose , dusted off his trousers , tossed away his stogie and crossed to St. George 's where the pastor , the Rev. Alexander Drum , gladly allowed him to examine the record of baptisms . It did not take him long to find what he sought . " August 7 , 1922 . Shirley Claiborne , son of Shirley and Ann Claiborne , born at Ophir Plantation , Fredericksburg , on July 5 , 1922 . Sponsors and witnesses : John T. Young and wife , and his father . Signature of Clergyman , R. J. McBryde . " Immediately following was another : " August 7 , 1922 . Ann Claiborne , daughter of Shirley and Ann Claiborne , born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , two months and seventeen days . " Here was the best evidence of the two most salient facts  --  the birth and baptism of Shirley Claiborne which gave the latter title to the property under his grandfather 's will  --  an official record that could not be attacked . What use going further ? He reread the entries . H 'm ! He furrowed his shaggy brows . Curious that two such good church people as the Claibornes had been should have waited over two years to baptize their first child and had only done so after the birth of the second ! He clutched at it like the proverbial drowning man at a straw . It was patent that the natural and usual course had not been followed in this instance , and if Mr. Tutt 's half century of experience had taught him anything it was that the slightest deviation from the normal was worth instant investigation . Not that this was slight . Parents didP219not wait two whole years to baptize their only child without good reason . What could that reason have been ? Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? With the name of Shirley ? Was it in the expectation that they might thereafter have a son ? A fantastic possibility projected itself upon the screen of his imagination . With trembling fingers he copied the entries and hurried out . In front of the Princess Anne stood a taxi . Mr. Tutt climbed in , waked the somnolent driver and drove to " Ophir Plantation . " Ann was away , but little Shirley and Scarlet were in their accustomed hide-out under the arbor . He played with them a moment , then walked through the jonquils to the excavation beneath the white oaks where Uncle Peter was again at work with his shovel . " Flow old are you , Uncle Peter ? " he asked . The old Negro stopped and wiped his tonsure with the back of his hand . " I got a lot ob age on me , boss . I reckon I mus ' be mos ' a hundredyears old . " " How do you figure it out ? " " Well , suh , I wuz a right big boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on mule-back to de mill , at de time ob de Civil War . " " You actually remember the Civil War ? " " I sho ' does !

" " You have a very good memory indeed , Uncle Peter ! What did they call Miss Ann up to the time she was christened ? " " Jes ' baby chile . ' I nebber hear ' em call her puffin ' but dat . " Mr. Tutt hurried back to his taxi . " Take me to Gaylorsville ! " he ordered . He had already made the acquaintance of the young rector when he had visited the nearby battlefield and had no difficulty in obtaining access to the baptismal record . It was a heavy book bound in tooled leather lying in full view on a shelf by the window . In fact he could have examined it without permission , for the church was open and the side door to the vestry stood ajar . " I want to look at the entries for about a month subsequentP221to May 21 , 1920 , " he explained as he turned the pages beginning twenty years back . " Now we 're getting it  --  March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 19 Icy fingers played " creep mouse " up Mr. Tutt 's spine . In aninstant suspicion became conviction ; the page for which he was looking had been torn out . Turning to the rector he said huskily : " Look ! There 's a page missing ! You can see where it has been removed .  --  Do you think it possible for someone to have got in here and done this without being seen ? " The rector flushed . " Quite possible . Everyone is so honest around here that the premises are apt to be left unlocked . " " I 'm afraid they 're not all as honest as you think , " said Mr. Tutt . " Would you be willing to trust this book to me for a couple of days ? It may help me to right a great wrong . " The rector , who had heard the story of the resemblance of the Apostle Peter to General Lee , gave his assent . That night Mr. Tutt took the train to New York . He was gone three days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following telegram : MRS MONROE CLAIBORNE OPHIR PLANTATION FREDERICKSBURG VIRGINIARETURNING TOMORROW STOP REFUSE ABSOLUTELY TO LEAVE OPHIR AND RESIST ANY EFFORT LEGAL OR OTHERWISE TO COMPEL YOU TO DO SOEPHRAIM TUTTHis train was four hours late , so that instead of arriving in Fredericksburg at six A.M. it did not get in until ten . Without going to the hotel he at once took a taxi to the plantation . As he had expected , Mr. Simmons and his client , a supercilious person with a flabby full-moon face , were there before him . So was Winslow Jordan , the sheriff , who was sitting in his car some distance away and viewing the proceedings with obvious reluctance . At the moment of Mr. Tutt 's approach Simmons was engaged in ordering Mrs. Claiborne , who was standing defiantly upon the front steps , to take her immediate departure . " Mrs. Claiborne has no intention of leaving Ophir , " interposedMr . Tutt . " Kindly remove yourselves before I appeal to the sheriff . " " Go ahead ! Appeal to him ! " returned Powell . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'll have her off by force if necessary  --  and you too . " " As you choose ! " replied the old lawyer quietly . " Sheriff Jordan , may I ask you to step over here ? What I have to say may interest you  --  possibly in your official capacity . " The sheriff got out and joined the little group . " I apprehend from your presence , " continued Mr. Tutt , " that these gentlemen anticipate that my client Mrs. Claiborne will refuse to vacate her property and have invited you here to persuade her to do so . Mr. Powell bases his claim to ownership on a deed given him by one Shirley Claiborne , her younger brother , who they assume took title to Ophir ' under his grandfather 's will . Now , before we go any further , I would like our friend Mr. Simmons here to take a look at this . " Mr. Tutt handed a folded paper to the attorney , who opened and glanced over it . " What sort of a joke is this ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my client give a quitclaim deed of this plantation to Shirley Claiborne , the very person who deeded it to him six weeks ago ? " " Because , " answered Mr. Tutt quietly , " you have filed a valuelessdeed which nevertheless might constitute in some measure ap223cloud on the title , and I want it corrected for the sake of the record . The Shirley Claiborne who assumed to deed this estate to your client was not the Shirley Claiborne who owned it . " Mr. Simmons ' sallow face changed color . " You 're talking nonsense . " " Am I ? " inquired Mr. Tutt . " This lady 's grandfather , the Rough Rider and friend of Theodore Roosevelt , after giving her father and mother each a life interest in the estate , willed it to whichever of their children should be named Shirley . He died before his first grandchild was born in Gaylorsville , where her mother happened to be visiting at the time . That grandchild was the present Mrs. Monroe Claiborne , my client . In order that there should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the will , her parents , as was natural , had her immediately baptizedunder the name of Shirley by the Rector of the Episcopal Church at Gaylorsville . There was no doctor involved and hence nc , birth certificate . Two years later a boy was born and , understandably , the parents thereupon decided that they would prefer to have Ophir descend in the male line , so when the new baby was a month old they took him to St. George 's in Fredericksburg , had him baptized as Shirley and his two-year-old sister rebaptizedunder the name of Ann . " I say this was quite natural in that the parents probably did not realize the legal significance of their previous act , but it is clear that when they gave their first-born child the name of Shirley she instantly became vested with title to the estate , which could not be divested by any subsequent act of theirs . " " Even if your story were true , your law is cockeyed ! " asserted Simmons . " Parents can change the names of their children as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the courts for a writ of ejectment in this case ! " challenged Mr. Tutt .   " I 've got a deed to this property and I propose to enforce my rights ! " declared Powell firmly . " You had better think twice before you seek assistance from the law , " warned the old lawyer . " It would hardly look with favor upon a title which you had acquired by condoning a felony . " " What 's that ! " shouted Powell . " Be careful or I 'll have you up for slander . " " The young man known to you as Shirley Claiborne who gave you this deed , " went on Mr. Tutt unperturbed , " had defrauded you out of several thousand dollars in securities . I have satisfactory proof that in return for an assignment of everything he possessed , including Ophir Plantation , you agreed not to prosecute him . " " That  --  even if so  --  would n't affect the title ! " answered Simmons . " This story of a prior baptism is just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs. Claiborne ? I know you 'll be honest about it . " " I never did ! " she acknowledged . " But I know I was born in Gaylorsville . " " And baptized there ! " added Mr. Tutt . " Try and prove it ! " sneered Simmons . " I sha n't have to try very hard ! Please pay careful attention , Sheriff . " Mr. Tutt opened his bag and removed from it a photostaticenlargement of the page of the baptismal record at Gaylorsville , opposite that which had been torn out . " Is not science wonderful ! " he mused . " The person who mutilated this book  --  after committing both burglary and theft  --  evidently was unaware that the chemicals of an entry in ink , if made in a book kept closed for a long period of time , often cause what is known as a migration ' of the writing to the opposite page . This may be either visible or invisible depending upon the character of the ink and paper . In old family Bibles printed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriages are frequently thus to be seen  --  in reverse , of course . But even an invisible migration , ' when photo-P225graphed under ultraviolet light , can be brought back  --  as here . " He held up the photostat . Although confused with the contemporarywriting on the page there could be clearly traced the words : " June 15 , 1920 . Shirley Claiborne , daughter of Shirley and Ann Claiborne of Ophir Plantation , Fredericksburg , Va. , born May 21 , 1920 , aged three weeks and four days . Sponsors and witnesses : Father , Mother and Adeline Taylor of Merry Mount , Gaylorsvillc . " " What really interests me most , Mr. Simmons , " continued Mr. Tutt , " is the fact that this ' mutilator '  --  as the criminal statutes call him  --  also left his calling card on this very page . His thumb mark is clearly visible in my photostat . If I 'm not mistaken a little further investigation may identify its owner . " Taking a small bottle of black powder from his pocket he dusted it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had laid hold of it and which had been previously given a transparentcoat of wax . Instantly there appeared in relief the compleximpression of a thumb . Mr. Tutt regarded it whimsically . " As I live and breathe ! " he remarked , comparing it with the other . " Like as two peas , are n't they , sheriff ! See that whorl ' as I believe they call it ? Ralph Simmons '  --  plain as the nose on your face ! Now , gentlemen , you perhaps understand why I feel so confident that you will not try to put Mrs. Claiborne  --  Ill i s . Shirley Claiborne , if you please  --  off her estate .  --  One other trifling matter ! " He spread a paper on the doorstep . " I almost forgot the deed to correct the one already recorded .  --  On the dotted line , Mr. Powell ! " " The hell I will ! " snorted the broker . " Come , come , Mr. Powell . Do you wish to find yourselfvolved if I apply to the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colorable title you may have is tainted in more ways than one . "
