 | Conqueror of the Brazilian Wilderness Condensed from The Pan American Desmond Holdridge I N THE towering heart of downtown Rio de Janeiro , in a simple office behind an unpretentious desk , sits one of the most remarkable men in this hemisphere . I le is short but incredibly broad , his back is ramrod stiff and in the junglewise eyes you see a crackling intelligence that misses nothing and forgets nothing . His hands move in quick , incisive gestures and the cavalier quality of his courtesy is the same whether he is talking to a cabinet minister or dictating a letter to his secretary . He is obviously of Indian stock . He looks a well-preserved 6o ; actually he is 8o years old . The man is General Candido Mariano da Silva Rondon and to him Brazil owes the peaceful conquest of nearly a quarter of a million square miles of unexplored wilderness . He has marked accurately one of the longest land frontiers in the world , and added to the map 15 rivers ? some bigger than the Hudson . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brazilian hinterland , pacified wild tribes that for three centuries had greeted civilization with whistling flights of seven-foot arrows , and he has filled the National Museum in Rio with thousands of specimens previously unknown to science . Practically every important geographical society in the world has honored him . His amazing career started from the most humble beginnings imaginable . He was born in 1865 near Cuiaba , the remote capital of the sprawling wilderness state of Matto Grosso . His mother was a Bororo Indian , his father the son of a Sao Paulo bandeirante ( pioneer ) and a Terena Indian . At the age of two he was left an orphan . He learned his first letters from his maternal grandmother , who had picked up some book learning from the ranching families for whom she worked . Later an uncle helped him through school . The boy had extraordinary talent , especially for  | mathematics and engineering , and he graduated at 16 . Ambitiously he tool , the entry examinations for the military school at Rio de Janeiro and while hopefully awaiting his appointment worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was no small thing Rondon was asking ? a penniless orphan without family connections wanting to get into a fine military school in competition with hundreds of much more fortunate youngsters . But the officers at headquarters , impressed by his efficiency and loyalty , sent letters recommending him , and Rondon was admitted . There he pored over the map of Brazil , noting how it was splattered with the legend : " Unknown region inhabited by savage Indians . " Interminable frontiers , also unmarked , depended on vague treaties hundreds of years old . Let gold , say , be discovered ; at once Brazil and the neighbor involved would be at loggerheads , each able to prove by ancient documents that the gold lay inside its own territory . No more fertile breeder of war existed on the continent than these unmarked frontiers . The Indian problem also was acute . The rubber boom in Amazonas , while making Mangos the richest city per capita in the world , brought reckless , greedy spirits who stopped at nothing to loot the jungle . They made slave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men for the killing labor of the rubber trails and the best-looking women for the entertainment of ti lonely camps . Rondon pondered these thing and was troubled . His chance can in 1891 , with the founding of tl United States of Brazil . The new Government decided to run telegraph lines into the hinterlands Major Gomes Carneiro , in charge c the construction of 400 miles of line between Cuiaba and Araguaia , cho : as his assistant the newly graduate Lieutenant Candido Mariano d Silva Rondon . TROUBLE with the Bororo Indian began almost as the work started But after a patient program of peace ful contact , with presents and kin . words , the Bororos soon got the idea : the uniformed men were not the riff ruff ci.vilizados that had plundered their villages . Peace was established and 13 months later the line was complete , the first in Matto Grosso , an area twice as large as Texas . During the next ten years Rondon worked on telegraph lines , ending strife three centuries old in one area after another . Nearly 2000 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Around him he gathered loyal assistants , durable men who could go for months without seeing aught save jungle . They had his approach to the Indian problem : never fire a shot , no matter what the provocation ; never remove so much as a leaf from a village . To hard-bitten old jungle trekkers this was the purest kind of mumbo jumbo . But it worked with tribe after  | tribe . Typical was the winning of the fierce Nhambiquaras who lived in Me region of the fabulous Rio J uruena . Rondon 's first encounter with them was a surprise attack . The third arrow , launched at him after two near-misses , crashed into the strap of his shotgun over his heart . The blow made him reel in his saddle , but he recovered himself and continued to shout words of peace and friendship . It was too much for the savages ; here was a man with an arrow hanging from him who insisted that he was a friend . They lied . Presents of axes , machetes and cloth were left at the scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years later Rondon 's party fell in with the Nhambiquaras again . A well-worn path indicated the nearness of a large village . With two men Rondon left his party and set forth . Suddenly they came upon five husky savages , unarmed , who led them to the village , where the excitement was tremendous . Food was brought to them ? corn , fruits , smoked monkey meat and roasted wood grubs . There were big calabashes of wild pineapple drink ; and large , fearsome-looking black cigarettes . Rondon had never smoked a cigarette in his life , but it wa : plain that refusal now would breed distrust . So he accepted . The next day Rondon led a band of Indian : back to his column where present : were exchanged . Today the Nhambiquaras bald schools , churches and medical attention . They revere the green-and-gold banner of Brazil that Rondon brought them as a symbol of peace and unforced change . Their lands are guaranteed to them , and the right to keep their tribal beliefs and way of life . But under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brazilian civilization takes hold . Portuguese becomes the prevailing tongue ; agriculture and animal husbandry take the place of the nomadic life . The road to the modern world is opened . THE INDIANS call the mysterious telegraph line " Mariano 's tongue . " This label makes Rondon chuckle . " They used to steal the wire off the first telegraph poles and make ornaments from it . But once they understood that we used the wires to communicate with each other they left them alone . As you see , though , we had to convince them with a very personal figure of speech . " Rondon 's instrument to achieve this relation with one tribe after another is a unique organization which he created in 1910 , the Indian Protection Service . A set of laws gave the forest dwellers every guarantee against exploitation and usurpation of their lands . All over the hinterland pacification posts were erected and little by little the Indians were attracted to them . Along with this peaceful conquest went map correction . The Commission Rondon , as the group was popularly termed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | termined the course of new ones . The most famous of these , the River of Doubt , was mapped when Theodore Roosevelt came to Brazil . He wanted the real thing and Rondon saw that he got it . They spent four months exploring the great stream to its confluence with a known river . Today the River of Doubt is the Rio Roosevelt , so marked on all maps . With Rondon 's drive behind it , the Brazilian Government pushed its frontier-marking program . One neighboring government after another was induced to appoint a boundary commission to work with the Commission Rondon . Hundreds of men have explored and surveyed the jungle until today the longest land frontier in the world after Russia 's is almost completely mapped . In 1932 Peru and Colombia nearly came to war over a series of jungle skirmishes caused by a boundary disagreement . That the Leticia incident was settled without more bloodshed was due in great measure to the prestige and common-sense decisions of General Rondon , who was the Brazilian delegate and chairman of the Mixed International Commission . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the commission to the League of Nations , but not once was that necessary . RONDON paid for his diplomatic triumph with the sight of one eye and the greatly impaired sight of the other , for he contracted trachoma during the four years he slaved on the commission . Only his incredible toughness has saved him from worse He has spent 5o years in the wilderness and at 8o is a remarkable physical specimen . He always wore out the men who traveled with him , eve the Indians themselves . Once , leading a large and utterly exhausted column of horsemen , he kept the going until 11 o'clock at night , dismounted fresh as a daisy and said : " We 'll have supper now and proceed again at one o'clock in the morning . " There was an anguished howl from his companions : " How can we go on with a bare hour 's sleep ? " they demanded . Rondon stared at them in astonishment . " But , is it possible , " he asked , " that you gentlemen do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have joined his expeditions have failed to believe the legends about his endurance . One , a trained athlete of 28 , bragged : " The General is more than twice my age ; I 'll walk him until he has his tongue hanging out on his shirt like a necktie . " Naturally , Rondon heard about it and he invited the city athlete to inspect a newly cut trail with him . They took off at a terrific pace , the young man grinning to himself . But two hours later there i was no sign of a change of pace and he stopped grinning . After six hours the tottering young man faltered out that something to eat might be a good idea and Rondon said : " Oh , no . I never eat when inspecting trails . " That was the last straw and an hour or so later the bumptious young  | man threw himself on the ground , heedless of ants , and gasped : " I ca n't go another step , sir ! " Rondon surveyed him coolly and replied : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is a jungle , not a gymnasium , and you should learn something about it before making reckless promises to your companions . " Another instance of this remarkable physical endurance occurred when the River of Doubt expedition ended . Rondon saw everyone ? Roosevelt included ? off on a comfortable steamer and then instead of going by sea to Rio himself he plunged into the jungle again and returned overland , a traverse of more than 2000 miles . He has suffered most tropical diseases ; he has had innumerable bouts of malaria , many of them violent attacks that would have killed a lesser man . Once while exploring a proposed telegraph route he grew so sick with fever that the expedition 's doctor told him he must return to Rio . " You may return , Doctor , " Rondon told him , " but here I stay to lead this expedition until its objective is attained . " THE COUNTRY he explored has vast agricultural , cattle-raising and mineral potentialities . There is petroleum in its western extremes ; diamonds and gold are coming out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precious hardwoods in the world are barely tapped . There are big stands of rubber and balata . Today the cry in Brazil is A marcha ao oeste , the march to the west . Highways are lengthening into what was a wilderness when Rondon attacked it . The railroads extend their steel threads and planned cities begin to rise in what was once wasteland . Millions of new population will find homes and livelihoods in a tamed land ? many of the pathetic population wreckage of Europe . " We would welcome them with open arms , " says Rondon . " Let them come ; there is room for all who will work . " All who know us know we are a nonviolent people . I am a soldier and I have devoted my life to a practical exposition of the superiority of reason to violence . The killing of Indians ! It is so easy to kill people but it solves so little . It is harder to use reason , of course . And it takes more courage . My men , who said : We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a higher kind of courage than the ignorant rubber bleeder who would open fire on anyone without pants . " We have carried that spirit into our relations with the rest of the world . From this belief in peace comes a strength no worshipers of violence ever possess . "
