Eighty-one new merchant ships ( 890,700 deadweight tons ) were delivered by U.S. yards in October . This was twelve ships under the record September output , leaves shipbuilders with the nearly impossible task of producing two million tons more by year 's end if they are to achieve their goal of eight million tons in 1942 . Explaining the sag in October output , the Maritime Commission laid the cause to " diversion of a considerable amount of the merchant shipbuilding capacity to emergency construction of special craft for the armed forces . " <P> But although shipbuilders may not launch their full quota , repair yards this year have set a new and brilliant record . In a recent twelve-month period they overhauled and refitted some 5,500 ships ( of over 1,000 tons each ) and they did this in the incredibly short time of an average of 17 days per ship . <P> To the repair yards came Axis ships seized last winter in U.S. ports , most of them hideously mutilated ; came limping torpedoed and shelled ships with ghastly scars ; came those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , too ; came others for conversion from sleek passenger liners to troop carriers ; hundreds were fitted with degaussing apparatus , armed with guns . Some repair jobs were on such a large scale that the ships were practically rebuilt , many were completely re-engined . In one month 783 ships were under repair in 40 yards .
