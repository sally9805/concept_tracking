txt A two-way squeeze on cotton clothing is shaping up to plague civilians this summer While warmer weather promises to cut the efficiency of the nation 's laundry services during their peak July-August load , supplies of cotton cloth are becoming increasingly scarce . Consumer ingenuity will be taxed anew in the coming scramble for cotton wearables . Shortages are expected to he most severe in piece goods . particularly those of apparel quality . Denims and charnbrays , seersucker . fine shirtings are practically non-existent for civilian use Low grade textiles such as cheesecloth and bagging may remain relatively plentiful . /Raw cotton consumption during the ten months ending May 31 dropped P30. - 000 bales under the comparable period in the preceding season , the New York Cotton Exchange reported yesterday . Lack of manpower and machinery limited the ability of mills to make cloth Home Sewing No Solution Hcnisewivek who had hoped to combat the shortage of inexpensive cotton clothes ny making them at home now find their sewing machines must remain idle for lack of materials . All cotton clothes will be scarce but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government officials admit they have n't found I I an Aladdin 's Lamp to increase the production of inexpensive garments . The result : Fewer house dresses and more " glamorized ' gowns " at high prices . Experts at the Office of Civilian Requirements . the public 's wartime friend , sadly report that manufacturers . confronted with a limited supply of cotton cloth , are following the more lucrative practice of converting it into garments , particularly the more expen- sive ones . This is in good part responsible for the depletion of retail stores ' yard goods . Rationing Plans Shelved Although top war agency officials appear to have shelved all clothes rationing plans a trip through these agencies turns up considerable confusion about this subject . For instance . The War Production Board still dislikes the idea of rationing . " R would create almost as many problems as it would solve , " one official there maintains . W.P.B. representatives suggest that individual requirements for the cloth would vary so greatly that the Office of Price Administration would have a terrible time deciding about ration points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the Office of Price Administration would carry out . the mechanics . ) O.P.A. officials doubt there is enough cotton cloth to rakon ( although W.P.B. thinks there is ) . About the most optimistic note from O.P.A. comes from one man who believes that " rationing difficulties would not be insurmountable . " The O.C.R. ( a branch of W.P.B. ) thinks that cotton cloth rationing , in theory , would benefit the consumer but fears that at present its impractical . For one thing , officials there contend , cotton rationing would throw such a burden on wool and synthetic fibres that textiles made of them also would have to be rationed . Meantime , 0.0 R. is working on a scheme to make more cotton cloth available to the folks at home by ordering manufacturers to set aside a certain percentage of their production for the retail trade This would bolster the sharply shrinking yard goods supply . The agency o n't start such a plan , however , until certain " bugs " ( like assuring small stores their fair share ) have been ironed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This situation mirrors other current disagreements among Washington 's planning and supply agencies as to how best to solve the cotton cloth dilemma . Prospective production , it is admitted , will be insufficient to give civilians all the cloth they want to bus . There is little likelihood that output can be stepped tqf now in time to aid the summer clothing shortage . Gloomy on Future Prospects Meanwhile . O.C.R. experts have gloomy predictions on the continued scarcity of cotton goods . Although a slowing down of arms production would free workers for the manpower-short textile mills , a substantial part of any increased cloth production would go to Government channels , if some planners here have their way . Moreover , as soon as the Army cancels its cotton cloth contracts , the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is expected to step in with its own contracts . Total production of cotton goods has been estimated at about 10 billion yards for 1944 Civilians can expect to get only about balf that total . ( The amount actually scheduled for civilian users in July , August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining 5 billion yards on the 1944 production schedule . the military services will receive the major part , roughly 3 to 4 billion yards Smaller amounts will go for Lend-Lease purposes , relief rehabilitation needst and for exports to Asia , Africa and aLtin America . U N R R A estimates that European relief requirements for cotton goods for the nest six months after civilians start handling relief will run around one billion linear yards . Few Government officials think this requirement will be met . Members of the Combined Materials and Resources Board expect that the U. S might be able to supply around 300 million yards , compared with production which has been running around five billion yards in six months . , Britain 's . Output Down Great Britain . formerly a major cotton textile exporter , will be able to provide only about half as much as the United States , Board members say . British output has dropped during the war because the country has needed its scant labor supply for more essential war activities . U. S Government officials do n't expect British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 300 mullion yards ot cotton cloth last year . and C NI.R.B. officials expect the figure may rise by 100 million or 200 million yards this year . A mission float Brazil is now in this country conferring the matter of cotton cloth exports . Braealuin delegates already have agreed to expand ports and cooperate with the U S. in deciding on destinations so that the scarce supplies will be spread out thinly , not lumped in certain areas . The C.M.R.B. also hopes that Mexico will be able to supply 100 million yards of cotton goods exports per year . But India , one of the world 's largest cot , ton cloth producers , wo n't play any part in the European relief picture . It is being , counted on to meet the hulk of Eastern lei lief requirements for cotton goods and will , concentrate on such places as Burma , Malaya , China and the Netherlands Indies . So far UN R R A has not estimated the exact size of Eastern relief needs for cotton textiles .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
