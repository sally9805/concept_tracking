The little man felt ill at ease . <P> And said , " Some bread , sir , if you please . " <P> The waiter 's voice roared down the hall , <P> " You gets no bread with ONE MEAT BALL ! " <P> The plaintive ballad about the man who dared ask a wartime waiter for one meat ball is fast becoming a fad with U.S. bobby-soxers . The adolescents have no idea how old-fashioned they are : their latest musical hero was well known to Boston in the 1850s . Almost a century ago , a shy Harvard Latin professor named George Martin Lane tried to buy a single fish ball in a restaurant , heard his piddling order bellowed out by a surly waiter . <P> The professor preserved his humiliation in a song called The Lone Fish Ball , which was published in Harper 's Monthly ( 1855 ) .

Jimmy Savo made the newest recording of the modern version for Decca . But bobby-soxers already knew the recordings of Josh White , Tony Pastor , the Andrews Sisters . <P> The bouncy music of the old song has been discarded for a minor-keyed tune . The refurbished lyrics are by Songwriter Hy Zaret , who recalls : " I first heard The Lone Fish Ball at a party about a year ago . . . . It knocked me over . . . . My version was a lot different . . . but I decided I 'd like to use some of the old lines . . . . I 'd heard that James Russell Lowell had done a version of it . If Lowell can do it , Hy Zaret can . . . I figured .
