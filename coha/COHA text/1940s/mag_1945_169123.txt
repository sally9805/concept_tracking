Last week , less than a month after stormy Camillien Houde was elected mayor of Montreal , came a move to oust him from his $10,000-a-year job . One Lo Dor , identified only as a truck driver and obviously acting for someone else , filed a petition in superior court to have Mayor Houde 's election annulled . <P> The chief charges : 1 ) Houde had bribed his way into office ; 2 ) he had bet on the election ; 3 ) he was ineligible because he had not been a resident of Montreal for the required three years before election day ( Houde was in internment camp for four years , until last August , for urging Quebeckers not to register for national selective service ) . Justice Louis Cousineau ordered the Mayor to defend himself in court . <P> Whoever Mayor Houde 's antagonists were , they would need plenty of proof to back their charges , plenty of energy to make them stick . Hardly anyone doubted that Houde , wily in the ways of politics , would be able to wriggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat back to watch the fun . <P> The Mayor , unperturbed , went skating . On an open-air rink in eastern Montreal , cavorting youngsters saw his portly honor . He was swathed in sweaters and wore a ceinture fleche around his waist ( see cut ) , and his outsize nose was empurpled with the cold as he skillfully performed the figures he had learned during idle hours in the New Brunswick internment camp .
