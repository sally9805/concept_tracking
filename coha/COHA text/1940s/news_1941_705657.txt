txt A good indication of how deeply individuals and corporations will have to reach down in their jeans when the tax collector comes around next year was given yesterday by the House ways and means committee . The committee tentatively agreed to raise from new and increased taxes on individual and corporate incomes $2,480 million of its $33ft billion revenue program . The remainder will come from higher estate and gift taxes and new and increased excise levies . A single person with $5,000 of net income , for example , would pay federal income taxes of $473 under the committee 's plan , instead of the $171.60 paid under existing law . Altogether , the committee will raise about $1,360 million Tax Bill Testimony Testimony presented before the House ways and means committee by Colin F. Stain , chief of staff of the joint congressional committee on taxation , against the Treasury 's excess profits tax plan and the answer by John L. Sullivan of the Treasury Department appear on Page 5. from heavier levies on individual incomes . Corporations , likewise , will find their federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new surtax rates approved by the committee will add another $1,255 million to their contribution to the federal government . Will Apply to 1941 Earnings The new and increased rates , constituting the highest single hike the committee has ever adopted at any one time , will apply to the 1941 earnings of both individuals and corporations . While the committee 's income tax program still is tentative and must face both the House and Senate before it reaches the statute books , it is the first concrete expression of congressional sentiment on how to raise an additional $3% billion of revenue . The tax bill may be changed before it becomes law but there is no reason to believe , however , the program finally enacted will be any lighter . All of the increased revenue from individual incomes does not flow from the committee 's surtax schedule , which starts at 5% on the first $2,000 of net income after the personal exemption and credits for dependents has been taken . The burden added by this schedule is $1,055 million . In addition , husbands and wives having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which means higher surtaxes for them if their income is substantial . This feature of the program will raise more than $304 million . Effect on Individual Incomes The following figures show tax payments a single individual with various amounts of net income would pay under the committee phut and compares it with tax payments ( listed in parenthesis ) required under present law : $2,000 of net income . $110 of taxes , ( $44 ) ; $2,500 income , $159.50 ( $63.80 ) ; $5,000 income , $473 ( $171.60 ) ; x10,000 income , $1,469.60 ( $686.40 ) ; $25.000 income . $7,073 ( $4,25260 ) ; *50.000 income , $20,715.20 ( $14,709.70 ) ; and , $100,000 income , $54,168.40 ( $44,268.40 ) . The committee left unchanged the present personal exemptions of $2,000 for married persons and $800 for single persons and the credit of $400 for each dependent . The committee made no change in the present 4% normal income ' tax and also left the special 10% defense increase unchanged . This 10% increase will , of course , apply to taxes under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drastic in the surtax brackets below $10,000 than the Treasury proposed . In the brackets between $10,000 and $80,000 , they are more drastic than the Treasury recommended . On the brackets between $80,000 and $1 million , where the increases stop , the committee and Treasury rates are about the same . Under the committee rates , a married couple with $5,000 of net income would pay federal income taxes  --  normal and surtax increased by the 10% defense tax -- of $308 , compared with $110 under present law and $506 under the Treasury plan . A single person with $5,000 of net income would pay $473 under the committee plan , compared with $171.60 under present law . In making changes in the corporation excess profits tax law , the ways and means committee followed the recommendations of the Staff of the joint congressional committee on internal revenue taxation . It retained the earnings alternative to the invested capital method of determining the excess profits tax exemption over the objection of the Treasury . However . it tightened up drastically on deductions allowed and reduced the invested capital credit from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in excess of $5,000,000 . The major revenue raising feature is the new requirement that companies compute their excess profits before , not after , deductions for federal corporation income taxes . This operates to broaden the excess profits tax base and to push a higher portion of excess profits into the higher rate brackets . Before computing the 24% normal income tax and the new surtaxes , which amount to 5% on the first $25,000 of income and 6% on the remainder , the excess profits tax can be deducted from earnings . The change in the deduction for taxes will require adjustments in earnings during the base years 1936-39 . As the average earnings are computed under existing law , income during the base period is reduced by the normal tax , which averaged 17% in these years . Under the committee plan , the normal tax paid will be put back into the earnings for the purpose of determining the average . The committee also approved , on the recommendation of the staff , a sharp increase in the present excess profits tax rates . The increase amounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present minimum rate of 25% on the first $20,000 of excess profits to 35% and the present maximum rate of 50% on excess profits above $500,000 to 60% . The committee agreed to continue the 8% invested capital credit on capital up to $5,000 , - 000 . The credit on capital above this level was reduced to 7% . New capital coming into a company will be allowed a credit of 10% , under the committee 's plan . The excess profits tax rates agreed on by the committee are as follows : The 10% War Profits Tax The special 10% war profits tax approved by the committee was recommended by the Treasury Department and will apply only to those companies following the invested capital method of computing their excess profits credit This tax will apply to that portion of a company 's earnings which is in excess of its average return during the base period years , but not in excess of the invested capital credit . - It is aimed primarily at earnings increases resulting from defense contracts , the theory being that firms benefiting more directly from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ select the invested capital method of computing credit The corporation surtax , also proposed by the Treasury , is designed to reach corporate income derived in the form of interest on holdings of partially exempt government bonds . The interest from these partially exempt bonds is exempt from normal - taxes only . It is subject to surtaxes . With these decisions out of the way , on a tentative basis , and only changes in the estate and gift and excise taxes **  --  g for action , committee leaders expressed hope they can complete the revenue program by the end of next week . If this is done , they said , the drafting service should have the bill prepared and ready for the floor of the House shortly after July 7 . It 111 highly probable that the ? committee , in acting on excise tax changes , will vote against the increases proposed by the Treasury for the tobacco and cigarette tames . Also , there is strong opposition to the proposed increases in the excises on alcoholic beverages , especially on beer , and on gasoline . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods articles like automobiles.
