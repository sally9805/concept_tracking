Stalwart Ezequiel Padilla , Mexico 's Foreign Minister since 1940 , resigned last week as the result of a campaign of backstage intrigue and a storm of public criticism . Rivals within the Mexican foreign service , notably Francisco Castillo Najera , Ambassador to the U.S. , had long been gunning for 6-ft. , spruce Ezequiel , sometimes called " the black Narcissus " because of his darkish skin and elegant attire . Other political opponents may have undermined him with President Avila Camacho , hoping to head him off as a candidate in next year 's presidential election . <P> These maneuvers were on the quiet . Far from quiet was the clamor against Padilla as a too obedient friend of the U.S. State Department . In the interest of Pan-American unity , he had favored admitting Argentina to the United Nations conference at San Francisco . Anti-U.S . feeling , always smoldering in Mexico , recently burst into flame with a series of speeches and newspaper articles against Padilla . His collaboration with the U.S. , they charged , had turned into " entreguismo " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Ambassador George S. Messersmith was urging President Harry S. Truman to use U.S. influence to make Padilla President of Mexico . <P> The leading Padilla-baiter was Vicente Lombardo Toledano , loud-speaking leftist chief of the powerful Latin American Federation of Labor . At San Francisco , declared Lombardo , Padilla had stooged for the U.S. State Department . He had an " anti-Soviet phobia " ; his attacks on the Russian delegation had followed the propaganda line of Generalissimo Francisco Franco , pet hate of Latin American labor . <P> Hurt and indignant , Padilla denounced his critics for " constant attacks and slander . " The same day he resigned .
