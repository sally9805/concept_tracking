Through the 27 days of campaigning for the run-off primary for Texas ' governorship , hard-pitching , New Dealing Dr. Homer Price Rainey strove mightily to overcome the 152,000-vote handicap that was indicated by last month 's indecisive Democratic primary . Said onetime baseballer Rainey : It wo n't be over till the last man 's out in the ninth . <P> But last week , to no one 's surprise , friendly , middle-of-the-roader Beauford Jester smacked out a home run to win the ball game with a two-to-one majority . His chief campaign promises : increased old-age pensions without increased taxes , a hearty welcome for all shades of warring Texas Democrats . To Rainey 's last-minute charges of Ku Klux Klan backing , he quipped : " He has lost his fast ball , he has lost his curve ball . All he 's got left is a mud ball . " <P> A Texan 's Texan , softspoken , greying ( 53 ) Beauford Jester had all the attributes of a winning candidate : Texas-born , son of a former Texas lieutenant governor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain in World War I , father of three children ( one a pretty Texas coed ) . <P> Lawyer Jester 's public batting average was 1,000 . In his first try for political office he won a seat on the railroad commission in 1942 , was re-elected to a full six-year term two years later . He had his own explanation for his victory , which fitted in with 1946 's conservative voting trend . Said he : it showed Texans wanted no part of " newfangled theories of government .
