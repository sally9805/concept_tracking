At one disconcerting period in his career , Hollywood Big Shot Nicholas M. Schenck took a $50,000 bundle of bills to Manhattan 's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel , dropped it on the bed and looked out the window . Other Hollywood tycoons got into the same strange habit . Somehow or other , Willie Bioff , a pimp turned labor racketeer , was always there to scoop up the bundles , split them with a fellow scofflaw , George Browne , president of the A.F. of L. Stage and Movie Operators Union . Willie and George acted for a gang of Chicago mobsters . The motion-picture industry thus parted with a million dollars . <P> Confronted with this shakedown of big shots by big shots , the Government improved upon an old police practice-wheedling small-fry criminals into testifying against bigger ones . Now big shots squealed on big shots . Nicholas Schenck 's brother Joe , imprisoned for income-tax evasion , informed on Browne and Bioff-and was soon paroled . A year ago , bored with the stuffy interior of the Federal Penitentiary at Leavenworth , Browne and Bioff squealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afterward , they were moved to the security of the " squealer 's prison , " a U.S. institution at Sandstone , Minn . Last week , three years after their conviction for eight and ten years respectively , a grateful Government put them on probation , gave them their freedom . <P> Lawyers in U.S. Judge John C. Knox 's court had sung the praises of Willie and George well . It had taken considerable temerity , they pointed out , to testify against such Chicago mobsters as Louis ( " The Man to See " ) Campagna , Frank ( " The Immune " ) Maritote and Charles ( " Cherry-Nose Joy " ) Gioe . This was convincing to Judge Knox , who freed Willie three years and George two years before they would normally be released for good behavior . Their prison behavior , incidentally , had been magnificent . Said Willie 's lawyer : " He has the garbage cans at Sandstone shining as they never shined before . "                 @ @ @ @
