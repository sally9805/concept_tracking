The East is already so short of sugar that rationing is overdue-and the Senate Finance Committee is this week going to try to find out what 's wrong . There has been no sugar rationing yet , because the Administration has not dared put it into effect-for fear that the public would demand its half a pound per week , when retailers do not have it to sell . But the Senate committee will be far more daring than the Administration if it has the nerve to tackle the political interests which have gotten the U.S. into its present sugar fix . <P> Is There Enough ? Estimates of this year 's sugar supply range from Leon Henderson 's pessimistic 5,300,000 tons ( 2,200,000 tons below 1941 's record consumption , 1,400,000 tons below the 1932-41 average ) to the Commodity Research Bureau 's 8,360,500 . The great unknowns are 1 ) the 1941 carryover , estimated by the Department of Commerce at 2,000,000 tons on Jan. 1 ; 2 ) 1941 consumer hoarding , which some guesses put as high as 1,000,000 tons . <P> But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply is not mathematical . It is military . For more than two-thirds of the U.S. sugar supply comes from offshore , and it takes precious ships to bring it in . The present plight of the East Coast , in fact , is thanks to U-boat activity in the Atlantic and Caribbean . The Japs , in occupying the Philippines , cut off about 900,000 tons a year for the U.S. Besides , the Jap 's conquest of the Indies closed the last big source of sugar for Britain and probably for Russia ( which lost two-thirds of her home supply with the Ukraine ) , and both these nations now become a charge on U.S. sugar supplies . Moreover , war takes explosives , which require alcohol , whose production is most easily expanded by using sugar . <P> Although some of these deductions from the sugar available to the U.S. can properly be charged to war , others are chargeable to politics . The U.S. 's annual sugar quotas have been political compromises to appease the various sugar lobbies which infest the Capitol . <P> For political reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplies on the Philippines , importing them across 7,000 miles of Pacific Ocean rather than across 200 miles from Cuba . For political reasons , the quotas of Hawaii and Puerto Rico , and particularly the quotas of U.S. beet-and cane-sugar producers have been kept high ( in relation to their production ) - and the quotas of Cuba kept down . <P> Back to Cuba . The result has been that Cuba , a low-cost producer close at hand , which by all the laws of economics should have supplied the U.S. , has had her production cut ( see chart , p. 63 ) by the laws of man . And now the U.S. has to turn to Cuba again for most of its supply . <P> Cuba 's estimated production for 1942-all of it bought by the U.S. except what Cuba requires for her own use-is considerably bigger than in recent years . But Cuba can not in one year turn back the hands of the clock . In 1925 she produced 6,000,000 tons , but having sold only about 2,000,000 tons a year to the U.S. during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do for the U.S. and Lend-Lease in 1942 is 3,800,000 tons .
