ALL THE WET ANIMALS A Story MAX STEELE Illustrations by Jonathan Tichenor F OR a long time , almost two years , Uncle Winfield did not work . That was the time in America when a great many people did not work . Uncle Win tried to make a job for himself , but somehow he could not , and since no one offered him any encouragement , he quit trying and just did nothing all day . He had been doing nothing for a long time when a fellow named Scruggs , whom he had been in college with , called him up . " How would you like a job ? " Scruggs said . In those days one had to be rather skeptical of a job that was offered suddenly . like that , and besides , my uncle did not want to appear too eager . " It all depends , " he said . Scruggs said that he would come around and talk to my uncle about the job . Uncle Win put on his clothes as carefully as if he were going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ razor blade . He put Jet Oil shoe polish on his black shoes . He put water on a hairbrush and tried to make the tuft of hair on the crown of his head lie down . Finally , he found his horn-rimmed glasses , that he had not worn in months , blew his breath on them , and shined them with a clean handkerchief . After Uncle Win showed Mr. Scruggs into the parlor , he excused himself for a moment and came back upstairs . " I look as good as he does , " my uncle said . Then he went back downstairs and shut the parlor door . He and the fellow talked and laughed for almost an hour . When my grandparents and Aunt Molly heard the front door slam , they went out into the hall . Uncle Win was coming up the steps three at a time . " f got the job ! " he yelled . " I 'm going to he the dog catcher ! " At first Grandpa thought that Uncle Win was joking . " Be serious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not ? " Uncle Win was still laughing his words out . " I 'm going to be the dog catcher , " he said . " The dog catcher ! " Grandmother said . " Yes , " Uncle Win said . " I 'm going back to work . " " Work ? " Grandpa snorted . " It 's better than nothing , " Uncle Win said . " Yes , " Grandpa said . " It 's better than nothing . " He went into his room and shut the door . " It can be a profession , " my uncle said , still overcome by his good luck , " like medicine , or law , or mixing milk shakes . " " Certainly , " Aunt Molly said . She was watching him as though she expected him at any minute to keel over from the excitement . Uncle Win stood on the top step and surveyed the hall below as though it were a square full of people and he were a speaker on a balcony . " Why , there must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Thousands of ways . No two alike . " He turned and looked at the hall and at Grandmother and Aunt Molly . " Do you know how to catch a dog ? " he said . " Heavens , nol " Grandmother said . " Neither do I , " Uncle Win said . " But I 'm going to learn . I 'm going to be the best dog catcher this town ever had . " " I 'm sure you are , " Aunt Molly said , still watching him carefully , for she had not seen him talk so much in the last two years . They stood , silent , in the dim hall for a minute . Then Uncle Win turned to Grandmother and said , " What would you do if you were walking down a side street and a big bloodhound with bloodshot eyes and foam at his mouth started at you from behind a hedge ? " Grandmother clutched at her high collar . " Now , Winfield , " she said , " just leave me alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about catching dogs . " " And then you start to run the other way and there is another bloodhound with bloodshot eyes coming at you from that way . . . " Uncle Win was saying . " Now , Win , " Grandmother said , open- " That glues me two days to study my profession . " ing the door behind her without taking her eyes off my uncle , " you 're just trying to get me upset again . " She darted into her room and shut the door . " When do you start work ? " Aunt Molly said . " Monday , " Uncle Win said . " That gives me two days to study my profession . " r-rHAT night my uncle went to the public library and borrowed seven books on the care and feeding of dogs . All day Sunday he read and made notes on what he read . From his desk he got out an old college notebook called " The Pathetic Fallacy in Wordsworth " and tore all of the used sheets out . He copied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different breeds of dogs . He even had a page for Afghan hounds , although there was not one in town . " You never can tell , " he said . " No , you never can tell , " Aunt Molly said . The next day my uncle was out of bed and dressed before anyone else . He had Finished breakfast and was on his way to the dog pound before the rest of the family got to the table . He came back about ten o'clock that morning to get a pair of coveralls and a white sweater that he had worn when he was a cheerleader in college . Then he went out into the garage and got half a sack of lime that had been left by the plasterers who patched the parlor ceiling the time the upstairs bathtub ran over . " I 'm going to whitewash the dog pound , " he explained to Aunt Molly and my grandparents , who were watching from the kitchen window . He did n't come home to lunch , but at dinner he was talking more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years before . Since breakfast he had had the old dog catcher kill the only two dogs in the pound , old dogs , too old to be saved . Then he patched all of the screen wire on the tops and sides of the dog runs . He showered the whole place out and threw away all of the food pans . All afternoon he whitewashed . To hear him talk one would have thought that he had known about dogs all of his life . " What is the masculine of dog ' ? " he asked at the table . " Winfield ! " Grandmother said . " No ! " Aunt Molly said , horrified with Grandmother 's answer . " Bull ! " Grandpa said . " No . ' Dog , ' just plain ' dog ' , " Uncle Win said . " Now who would have known it ? " Grandmother said , impressed by her son 's college education . All week Uncle Win worked at cleaning the dog pound . He took hollyhock plants from the yard and planted them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks and then whitewashed them . By the borders he planted nasturtiums from a ten-cent package . By Sunday he had the dog pound as clean and white-trimmed as a Gulf station . One week of work improved my uncle as much as it improved the dog pound . He walked tall now and was not shy around Uncle Bert , who worked for a living . He laughed more , and at the table he spoke out loud when he asked for things . Monday morning Uncle Win was ready to begin his collection of dogs . The family went out to the back yard with him and watched him climb up into the little Ford pickup truck with the big wirecage on it . It was a cold spring morning and the little truck coughed twice before it banged away and jumped backward . Uncle Win raced the motor so that clouds of steam came out of the exhaust pipe . Laughing loudly , so that he could be heard above the roar of the motor , he waved good-by . " Is n't he a lovely man ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I hope he wo n't be disappointed , " my aunt said . But there was no reason for her to worry long : before the breakfast dishes had been put away , the phone rang . " It 's Winfield , " Aunt Molly said , putting her hand over the receiver . " He 's caught a dog ! " " What kind ? " Grandmother shouted . Aunt Molly asked my uncle . " He does n't know , " she said , with her hand over the receiver again . Uncle Win called four more times that day . When the end of the week came , he had sixteen dogs listed in his book  --  fifteen of them were listed in a new section labeled " Miscellaneous . " The other one looked like a kind of collie , and so my uncle listed him on the page marked for collies . The more he studied his book , though , the sillier he thought it looked , and so he tore out the pages for special breeds and just entered all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did act like a man who was crazy , he was so proud of his job . For a while he could not eat his own meals for wanting to get down to the dog pound to feed the dogs . And when the evenings were cool he would leave the house and walk down to the railroad tracks and along the curving steel rails to the dog pound to close the doors to the runs , and to hang canvas over the windows . Late one evening , after the first summer storm , Uncle Win went back to take the canvas off of the windows , for the earth heat had begun to rise again . When my uncle came back , he looked sad . " The roof is full of holes . All of the dogs are wet . On a colder night they would catch distemper , " he said . The next morning he went up to see the city manager . " I want a roof for the dog pound , " he said to the manager . " The old roof is full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive in a building that leaks . " " We 'll see about it , " the manager said . " I 'll bring it up at the next meeting . " After the next meeting , my uncle went back and asked about the new roof . " Sorry , Win , old man , " the city manager said . " But we did n't get around to it . We 're still voting on changing the name of Hoover Street . " " It 's Winfield , " Aunt Molly said . . " He 's caught a dog ! " He went over to the newspaper office and walked right into the editor 's office . " Do you know what this city is doing ? " Uncle Win said to Sam Ellis , the editor . " No . What is this city doing ? " Sam asked Uncle Win . " It 's trying to drown my dogs . " Sam laughed . " Yes , " Uncle Win said . " Tomorrow I want you to publish an editorial telling " Tell them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy the material , I 'll put it on . I figure that the shingles and all will come to about $11.30 . " " I 'll tell them , " the man said . But when my uncle went back the next Friday to see what the council had decided , the manager said that the roof would have to last all summer , because the city had gone over its budget . " But . . . " Uncle Win said . " No buts about it , " the manager said , shutting the office door . When , a few days later , it rained again , my uncle did not go to the city manager . the people of this town that their own officials will not spend $11.30 for a roof for the dog pound . " Sam Ellis quit laughing . " I would like to , Win , old man , " he said , " but we 've begun a series of editorials against changing the name of Hoover Street , and we ca n't very well stop in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Win walked over to the door . " I do n't understand , " he said . " You 've got plenty of room . " Sam Ellis began laughing again so that all of the reporters in the outer office looked up . " And we 've got a certain editorial dignity to maintain . " My uncle frowned . " What 's that got to do with a new roof ? " he asked . Sam laughed even louder and said , " Just that I ca n't see our paper going to the dogs . " All of the reporters laughed very loudly , for jobs were hard to get that year . Uncle Win walked across the outer office muttering : " Fools , fools , fools . " The next day when he drove down town several of the reporters standing in front of the newsstand hollered to him : " Did you get the new roof for your dogs ? " Uncle Win was so mad with the city council and the city paper that he could not answer the reporters . He just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the red light to change . The reporters laughed and slapped each other and themselves when my uncle drove off without answering . The reporters must have told a lot of people about the dog pound roof and my uncle 's anger , for the next day when he drove down town the reporters hollered to him again , and several more people at that corner and the next . Uncle Win did n't answer any of them and that made them laugh . Uncle Win , even though he would not answer anyone who asked him about the roof , was not so angry as he looked . At home he said , " Well , they know now that the roof leaks , and with everyone talking about it I 'll get a new roof . That 's all I care about . " That 's what my uncle said , and maybe that 's what he meant , for he had no idea that the people in our town would do to him what they did : The next day , when he drove up Main Street and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people standing at that corner barked at him . The reporters barked first , and then the other men with the reporters . Uncle Win was so surprised and frustrated that he could not start the little Ford when the red light turned green . He pulled up the emergency brake , got out , and left the car in the middle of the street . He went into Shaffer 's drug store and called Grandpa . " They 're harking at me ! " he said . Grandpa swore like all hell for a few minutes , then calmed down and said , " Bark back at them ! " A crowd had gathered at the corner to watch the traffic jam caused by the abandoned truck . My uncle made his way through the crowd , climbed into the truck , and began blowing his horn like the other people in the jam . The reporters began barking again ; but no one heard , for the noise of the horns , that my uncle was barking back . Uncle Win thought that that would be the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon two newsboys on a paper route barked at him as he drove by ; and the next day all of the children at Parklawn School barked at him when he drove by during recess . He barked back at them and they were delighted . " Keep on barking back , " Grandpa said when Uncle Win told him that even the children were teasing him now . " They 'll soon quit , " Grandpa said , but he underestimated the people in our town . No one in the family , not even Aunt Molly , seemed to realize the struggle that Uncle Win was going through that week . The first night , when Uncle Win came home hoarse from barking , Grandmother said , " Do n't you remember anything about cheerleading ? Do n't use your throat . Let the noise come from here ! " She put her hand on her stomach the way she had seen her elocution teacher do . Other than that advice from Grandmother , nothing was said to encourage my uncle . When he quit talking at the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " His throat probably hurts . " 1111 Y THE afternoon of the fourth day my uncle 's voice was so hoarse that he sounded as though he were talking into a bucket . Late in the afternoon of that day he came home to eat some cracked ice . It was a hot day with the leaves hanging as still as death on the trees . Uncle Win looked at the swelling black clouds . When the first streak of lightning split the sky , he started off in a run to the dog pound . Before he got there , rain was falling in big drops that hit heavily like mercury , and like mercury splashed into smaller drops that rolled in the dust before the dog pound . All of the dogs were in the building except one little black and white fox terrier that stood in the corner of the dog run , barking at the rain and shaking his head when drops splashed on his nose . My uncle called the dog in . Pools of water stood in the yard by the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The raindrops pounded on the roof and then , in one corner , there was the sound of a steady drip , drip . My uncle put a bucket under the leak , but then there was another , and another , and the dogs began yelping . My uncle put cans and buckets under as per . Two of the dogs that had been pulling at his trouser leg stopped when they heard him speak . My uncle sat down on a barrel and began talking to the dogs between the clashes of thunder . As the storm came nearer , the dogs quit barking each time that the lightning He sang " Rock of Ages " and all of the other hymns that he knew . many leaks as he could , but the dogs ran around and knocked them over and barked at the noise the buckets made rolling across the floor . The canvas curtains flapped loose at the bottom and the big dog that looked like a collie jumped up and caught one in his big teeth and tugged until it ripped loose at the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other flapping curtain and keep the dogs from jumping up on him at the same time . He was so out of breath and so hoarse that he could hardly speak when he finally had the curtain tacked . " Quiet , boys ! Quiet ! " he said in a coarse whisflashed . My uncle was singing to the dogs now to keep them from yelping and running about . He sang " Rock of Ages " and all of the other hymns that he knew ; and then he sang to them the popular songs that he knew : " Smoke Gets in Your Eyes , " and a newer one about a merry-go-round breaking down . He did not seem to notice that he was sitting in the leakiest part of the dog pound and that he and all of the dogs were wet . He just kept singing until all of the dogs were lying down listening to him . He did n't notice exactly when the storm had passed . My uncle sang on until he realized that the square of light that he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved over to the door and looked at the little streams of water that were washing away his nasturtium plants , and at the whitewashed rocks that looked like teeth in a grinning skull . My uncle opened the door and called the dogs . Only two of them followed . My uncle went back into the building and got the box of scraps and bones from the high shelf . All of the dogs followed him out into the yard , stretching and growling lowly , then moving quickly at the sound of the papers in the box being unwrapped . Then my uncle opened the gate of the yard and called them again . They were slow , at first , in coming to the open gate . But then they ran through to Uncle Win , who was walking away from the dog pound as fast as he could on the wetground . The collielike dog did not stop to eat . He galloped off across the field , back toward the old neighborhood where he had been caught . My uncle watched him as he ran up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rest of the dogs did not realize , until after they had eaten , that they were free . For a while they thrashed around at my uncle 's feet , nosing the papers and looking for bones . Then , like the collie , they started off across the field , some of them glancing back to see if they were being chased . My uncle watched the pack disappear over the ridge . Then he turned and walked back past the dog pound . The little black and white fox terrier was standing in the door watching my uncle . My uncle walked on down the curving railroad tracks in the light of the moon that was sailing west in a sea of scud.
