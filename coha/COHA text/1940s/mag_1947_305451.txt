The Imperfect Lady ( Paramount ) is the spirited daughter ( Teresa Wright ) of a late-Victorian shopkeeper ( Reginald Owen ) . Touring with a dancing troupe against papa 's wishes , she meets and falls in love with Ray Milland , who tries to appeal to the audience going &; coming : he is standing for Parliament as a Liberal , and he is the brother of a lord ( Sir Cedric Hardwicke ) . After the young people are married , it develops that Teresa has been mixed up with a hot-tempered Spanish concert pianist ( Anthony Quinn ) whom the police suspect of murder . If she furnishes his alibi , she-and her husband-will be forever compromised . She and the audience know that it was a perfectly innocent night she spent with the musician-but will the British voters believe it ? These faintly lubricous difficulties are ultimately straightened out in a court trial . <P> The film is prettily produced and directed . Teresa Wright does delicate things with her eyes a little too often and too mechanically , as if she knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dated nonsense . She is quite right .
