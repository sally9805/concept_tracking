LONG , LONG AGO-Alexander Wooll-cott- Viking ( $2.75 ) . <P> Manhattan 's volubly witty Town Crier , the late Alexander Woollcott , had ten light literary fingers in a good many more pies , but what endeared him to his admirers was his habit of pulling out the juiciest borrowed plums in public with a happy little verbal smirk that meant : " What a smart boy am I. " Last month he did it again ( posthumously ) in Long , Long Ago , a very satisfactory second course to his highly comestible While Rome Burns ( TIME , March 12 , 1934 ) . Most of Wooll-cott 's plums are still on the sugary side , but the best ones have a pleasantly astringent pit . <P> Long , Long Ago contains stories , sketches , anecdotes and an occasional verbal sob . Practically everybody anybody ever heard of is cited , thumbnailed , keelhauled , cuddled , cried over or extolled . <P> The characters run from Lord Jeffrey Amherst and the late Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes to Harpo Marx and the only man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backwards . There is a heroic , the-play-must-go-on story about Katharine Cornell , who once arrived late for her show in Seattle , found her audience patiently waiting , and between 1 and 4 o'clock in the morning presented The Barretts of Wimpole Street , sustained only by one egg rustled up for her at 2 a.m. by Producer Guthrie McClintic . There is a story about Editor Robert Quillen , who used to spice his Fountain Inn ( S.C. ) Tribune with genealogical notices like : <P> " Born , on Monday , January 27 , to Mr. and Mrs. Jim Daderight , a son . The little fellow has the community 's sincere sympathy . On his mother 's side are three idiots and one jailbird of record , and nobody on the father 's side of the house can count above four . With that start in life , he faces a world that will scorn and abuse and eventually hang him through no fault of his own . " <P> There is a story about H. G. Wells and Vegetarian Bernard Shaw . Said Wells : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Shaw cheats . " Woollcott " tried to imagine the author of Candida and Saint Joan giving way to beefsteaks as a solitary vice . " " Yes , " said Wells . " He takes liver extract and calls it ' those chemicals . ' " <P> The best story is probably the one about Abraham Lincoln and Justice Holmes , when Holmes was a colonel in the Union Army . One day Holmes was conducting Abraham Lincoln around the Union lines when they came under Confederate fire . " Get down , you fool , " cried Holmes . Said the President , who knew how to talk to soldiers , " Colonel Holmes , I 'm glad to see you know how to talk to a civilian . " <P> Long , Long Ago may not be quite up to its predecessor , but in the field of storytelling it is , at its best , near tops .
