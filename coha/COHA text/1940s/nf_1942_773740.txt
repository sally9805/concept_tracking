txt Kissing Customs ORIGIN OF THE KISS The contact of the lips in the kiss is an inspired discovery and development of the Western World . Strange as it may seem to us of European heritage , the kiss was unknown in many parts of the world until Western explorers , travelers and missionaries carried their customs to the remote parts of our planet . Even today it is not the preferred form of intimate expression of love or affectionate greeting among most peoples in Asia , Africa , the Eskimo domains , Polynesia and other distant lands where the aboriginal customs still hold sway . Authorities tell us that the impulse to kiss is not innate to man ; that it has been developed gradually , and has only acquired by degrees a relation to the erotic sphere . Havelock Ellis regards the love-kiss as a development from the primitive maternal kiss and from the nursing of the infant at the mother 's breast , which are customary even where the erotic kiss is unknown . Out of these maternal caresses grew the kiss of love and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . Like many other quirks of human nature , the development of the kiss indicates a curious paradox in the pattern of human actions . Kissing as a manner of showing affection is said to have been comparatively a late development in mankind 's repertoire of caresses . Certainly , the custom can not be traced 80 81 as a form of affection in antiquity with any degree of positiveness . In all the Celtic tongues , we are told , there is no word for " kiss " . The custom of kissing appears to have been acquired by the Celts long after it became a racial habit of most other Europeans . Homer scarcely knew it , and the Greek poets , faithful portrayers of the customs of their time , seldom mention it . On the other hand , actions resembling and analogous to the kiss are found among a great many animals . Birds use their bills as a form of caress . Even snails and certain insects caress antennae . The dog who licks his master is expressing the physical attribute of the kiss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also lick each other as a form of greeting . Man 's closest relations in the animal world , the simians , are addicted to kissing . But , then , the subhuman primates are confirmed experimentalists and notorious sensualists , so they may have discovered its merits from the application of their tireless curiosity . Anatomically , the kiss is the ideal mode of expression of love and affection , as the lips are the seat of a particularly sensitive area , or erogenous zone , especially subject to erotic stimulation . As a stimulus of love , of course , the kiss must carry the fire and force of conviction . Byron , himself no tyro in the arts of love , recognized this when he wrote : A long , long kiss , a kiss of youth and love , And beauty , all concentrating like rays Into one focus kindled from above ; Such kisses as belong to early days , Where heart and soul and sense in concert move , And the blood 's lava , and the pulse a blaze , Each kiss a heart-quake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be reckoned by its length . // A PLEDGE OF LOVE The kiss has a special significance as a pledge of love , or , as has been more euphoniously expressed , the seal with which lovers plight their troth . It has also been defined by the physiologist Burdach as the symbol of the union of souls , analogous to the galvanic contact between a positively and a negatively electrified body . Even those who habitually treat the kiss lightly , perhaps scarcely less casual than a handshake , reserve a special place in their emotional potential for the kiss of fealty and affection . In some communities , it was , and still is among certain people , considered improper for a girl to permit a man to kiss her until he has asked her to marry him , and she has accepted . In our present modern world , this extreme attitude is looked upon as a provincial one , more typical of another age . The nuptial kiss of the bride and groom is an important feature of the marriage ceremonial . Aside from that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various peoples , and has been widely prevalent throughout Europe and among people of European derivation . It is still indulged in among all but the most dignified social groups . Quoting from an old Scottish source , we are told that " the parson who presided over the marriage ceremony uniformly claimed it as his inalienable privilege to have a smack at the lips of the bride immediately after the performance of his official duties . " It was firmly believed that the happiness of every bride depended in no small measure upon the pastoral kiss . As the pastor found the duty agreeable , he saw no reason to take issue with this popular belief . The Scotch , in particular , were much impressed with the importance of the bridal kiss . In some parts of Scotland , after the marriage ceremony , the bride was expected to proceed around the wedding company , attended by her maidens , and // kiss every one of the males present . A dish was then passed around , in which those so favored placed some money . This thrifty custom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practice for the brides on coming out of church to embrace all whom they met in the street , and in the province of Marche they were said to do so before the marriage service . One of the earliest definite instances of kissing as an expres-sion of love and affection is related by Leybard , the famous saint of Tours of the sixth century , who gave his betrothed " a ring , a kiss and a pair of shoes . " The symbolism , in the order given , is thus indicated : The ring to bind them together ; the kiss to seal the pledge of affection ; the shoes , as a sign of his utter subjection to her . Even in early medieval Europe , it seems probable that the kiss was not widely given as an expression of sexual or erotic sentiment . It appears to have been a refinement of love practiced only by the more cultivated social groups . It is only in a comparatively high stage of civilization that the kiss has been emphasized and cultivated in the art of love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Erasmus mentions that when he visited England he found kissing a widely practiced and general form of greeting . Upon his arrival at a house , the visitor kissed his host and hostess , all their children , and even the dog and cat ? so relates the great Renaissance scholar . From a fifteenth-century historian we learn that a young lady of rank in France , at that time , would rise in the midst of divine service , inconveniencing all those about her , in order to kiss on the mouth the cavalier who entered the church at the moment . France proved a fertile field for the appreciation and de-velopment of the kiss , and it was soon firmly established in the // pursuits of courtship and love . Montaigne remarked that in his country it was the privilege of any Jack with three lackeys to kiss almost any woman he chose . The dance embrace afforded an excellent opportunity , or excuse , and the popular dance figures were those that introduced a kiss in the proceedings . Louis XII is stated to have conferred the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman in Normandy . Perhaps that was a pleasant means of building up popularity and entrenching his throne . Today , politicians advance their cause and personal popularity by kissing babies . Kissing for popularity , however , is as old as Absalom . The example set by France quickly spread over most of Europe . In Russia , not given to inhibitions , the kiss is said to have become epidemic in scope . A kiss from the Czar was esteemed as one of the highest forms of official recognition . As a contrasting example , let us look at the status of the kiss among the urban Italians of the same period . The osculatory salutation was treated so seriously that if a maiden was kissed by a young man in public , it practically made marriage obligatory . Rowdies frequented the streets , which at best were no place for a young girl unless escorted . Historians of the period tell us that there was always the danger of a subtle sally from amorous eyes , or some familiarity , such as a kiss , from some undesirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force a marriage . We are told that even church was not a safe refuge for girls unescorted . In Venice young women of the wealthier classes always went to church hidden by long white veils , and accompanied by male escorts , or even armed retainers , according to their circumstances . Early in the sixteenth century , Pierto Lando , afterwards doge , but then podesta at Padua , ordered his own natural son // to be decapitated for the offense of kissing a girl , with whom he was in love , in the public street . THE KISS AS A SACRED PLEDGE In the Eastern World , the kiss was early associated with sacred uses , which seems to account for its practical omission in the sphere of love and affection . The ancient Arabians made their devotions to the gods by a kiss . The house gods were so greeted upon entering and leaving . There is evidence to indicate that the tactile kiss , whose usage has been our cherished heritage , originated in ancient times in Asia Minor ? where the vassal kissed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as is gleaned from the Hebraic Song of Songs ? " Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth . " In ancient Rome , too , the kiss indicated the sentiments of reverence and respect far more than those of love . This influ-ence left its impress on the early Christians , to whom it had almost sacramental meaning . It still retains its ancient and sacred significance to a great extent in the practices of both the Eastern and Western Churches . Thus , the kiss is bestowed upon the relics of saints , the foot of the Pope , the hands of bishops , just as the ancients kissed the images of their gods . Kissing the hand or the foot as a mark of homage or respect has been known from the very earliest times . Even in our secular life , until comparatively recently , the sacredness of the kiss was legally recognized in the form of taking an oath by kissing the Bible , now generally superseded by laying the right hand on the book and raising the left hand . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the kiss is still sometimes preferred . Kissing as a form of obeisance also existed among primitives , who did not know its significance in the realm of love ? per-86 haps because love , as we know it , held little or no significance to them . Among some African tribes the natives kiss the ground over which a chief has trod , as a sign of their reverence . The Australian aborigines kissed the ground , or more literally , breathed upon it , as a form of greeting and show of respect . The olfactory sense , incidentally , is closely bound up with the kiss , or its analogous manifestation ? such as nose-rubbing , etc. ? in many parts of the world . THE OLFACTORY , OR SMELL-KISS The kiss as known to man may involve either the sense of touch or that of smell , occasionally both . Our kiss of European origin is mainly tactile , or related to the sense of touch . A form of salutation , however , that has much wider vogue throughout the world is the olfactory kiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may at the same time in some instances simulate our tactile kiss . This type of kiss has representation even in Europe , among the Laplanders and the Russian Yakuts , both of Asiatic social heritage . It is the predominant form of kiss in Asia , Africa , Polynesia and other parts of the world , including some of the aborigines of the Americas . There are variations of the olfactory kiss , but a typical form is practiced in these three phases : ( a ) the nose is applied to the cheek of the person kissed ; ( b ) there is a long nasal inhalation accompanied by the lowering of the eyelids ; ( c ) followed by a slight smacking of the lips without the application of the mouth to the recipient 's cheek . The procedure is predicated on the sense of smell . It is said that the Chinese who have not become enamored of Western ways consider the European kiss as highly objectionable from the esthetic standpoint , being suggestive of ravenous cannibals . Native mothers in French Indo-China frighten their children by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Chinese regard their form of kiss as an expression of sexuality , appropriate only to lovers . Fathers refrain from kiss-ing their children except when very young , and even mothers // rarely indulge in the practice , and then surreptitiously . In Japanese literature kisses and embraces simply do not exist , as they are unknown as tokens of affection in Nipponese life . Japanese mothers may hug and caress their young children , as mothers do the world over , but after babyhood there is no more hugging and lipping . Except in the case of infants , such actions are regarded as immodest . Girls do not kiss one another ; nor do parents kiss or embrace their children after they are able to walk . This is true of all classes . Among the tribes of southeast India who practice the olfactory kiss , instead of saying to the loved one , " kiss me " , it is the custom to say in the native vernacular , " smell me . " Among other variations of olfactory osculation may be mentioned the following : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes her hand and places it to his nose , twice smelling the back of it . The native mothers on the Niger coast rub their babies with cheek , nose and mouth , but do not kiss them . Lovers , likewise , do not kiss , although they cuddle , squeeze and embrace . In Samoa kissing is analogous to smelling . The North American Eskimo practices only the olfactory kiss , as did the Blackfeet and some other Indian tribes , although kissing of any kind seems to have been unknown to many of the North and South American aborigines , as was also the case among the Dyaks of the Malay archipelago . The smell kiss is typical of Polynesia . In New Zealand nosepressing , or the hongi , is the native kiss of welcome and sym ? pathy . It is said that in Borneo kissing is a kind of smelling , and the word interpretative of smelling is used to indicate the act . A visitor to that country states he never saw a native kiss a woman . It is always done in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been suggested that the reason the olfactory kiss has prevailed almost exclusively among primitive peoples is that in the lower stage of humanity ? as in the animal world ? the sense of smell is a much more important factor than it is in the case of civilized man . The love zone of the primitive , as well as his nutritive zone , is more intimately related to his sense of smell . In the life of civilized man , on the other hand , the olfactory sense has been relegated to a relatively unimportant position among the senses . Being farther removed from primordial nature , the sense of smell is not so important as a life-sustaining factor , and its influence diminishes in all spheres of activity . In civilized man , sight is the paramount esthetic sense with s respect to sex , as well as to other phases of his cultural life . It is the first messenger of love . By means of this sense , color and form become the primary media of sexual stimulus . The sense of sight conveys the first total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are always first dependent upon sight . Of all the factors that enter into the choice of the loved one , the sense of sight is unquestionably supreme . THE EROTIC SIGNIFICANCE OF THE KISS As sexual love has been described by physiologists as a higher , specialized form of tactile sensation , the kiss plays an extremely important role in the refinement of the art of love . It is impossible even to think of the tender , consummate embrace of two lovers without the lingering rapture of the kiss . But among human beings of baser disposition , the manifestation of their " love " may be no more than a crude expression of the sense of touch . The kiss sets off the reverberating , electrifying spark of voluptuous sensation that permeates to the innermost parts of // our being . It is part and parcel of the love-play that leads normally to the realization of the sexual acme . However innocent a lover 's kiss may appear , it is never wholly asexual , and constitutes a stage between desire and possession . Surfaced by a tissue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of salivary sweetness , shaped at their loveliest into a curvature that has been likened to Cupid 's Bow , the lips seem especially contrived by nature for their role of allurement into the labyrinths of love . In its sensory impulses , the kiss is the most direct prelude and incitement to sexual fulfilment . It is for this reason that restraint and discrimination should be the watchword of those who understand the real meaning and importance of the kiss and hold in high regard the sacredness of the love forces which its casual bestowal may unwittingly release . THE LOVE-BITE It may seem like a contradiction of terms to speak of the " love-bite " , but the phrase has a place and a definite meaning in the story of the kiss . It is perhaps an intensification of the tactile kiss under the stress of voluptuous excitement . It is usually playful ? a tantalizing , controlled " bite " to increase sexual feeling ? but among peoples of ardent temperament and unrestrained impulses , it may assume the proportions of mild or extreme sadism . The love-bite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical of hardy-living , lusty peoples , but it is not unknown among highly cultivated individuals . It may be playfully enacted in connection with the familiar expression , " I could eat you , " or the wild kisses of passionate love may take the form of uncontrolled frenzy . Among the Southern Slays , it is said the custom of biting one another is general . This indicates the presence of mutual masochistic tendencies , as evidenced by the patience with // which pain is borne when it has a voluptuous tinge , as well as sadistic propensities . Its place in the normal fulfilment of ardent love is indicated by the heroine of Kleist 's Penthesilea , who aptly remarks : " Kusse ( kissing ) rhymes with Bisse ( biting ) , and one who loves with the whole heart may easily confound the two . " It has been suggested that the erotic kiss is a sublimation of the amorous bite ; the difference is quantitative rather than qualitative . KISSING AS A PASTIME Kissing as a pastime , modernly known as petting , is by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old customs change , but inherently there is little difference in the nature of the practice . The twentiethcentury automobile , with its comforts and conveniences , has done much to establish " petting " as a household term , and to create the legend of its modernity . Kissing along the roadside , however , occurred in the horseand-buggy days , whether known as " spooning " or " mooning " ; nor was it exclusively associated with the equestrian-minded . Pedestrians , too , have strolled down lover 's lane and its byways , have spooned and necked and petted and kissed from time immemorial . The great Scottish bard of love , Robert Burns , in another era , posed the delicate question whether , " Gin a body meet a body coming through the rye ; gin a body kiss a body , need a body cry ? " The answer may be in the length and ardor of the kiss , and whether it ignited a spark of love that was , well , not wise ! Like most of Burns ' superb , immortal lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an amorous episode from the hook of his own life . If so , he doubtless knew the answer to his own riddle. // The literature of the Western World is without limit in its treatment of the subject of the kiss , and kissing . It is the inexhaustible theme of popular songs of our time . Stolen kisses , kisses that linger , kisses in the moonlight , kisses in June , kisses any time , anywhere ? but kisses , kisses ! The motion picture has been a worldwide medium for publicizing the technique of the Hollywood kiss . Some State Boards of Censorship put a stop-watch on the film to make certain that the endurance of the osculation does not exceed the prescribed limit of time fixed by the Board . The communion of lips that does not linger beyond the specified time is deemed an innocent kiss that may properly be seen by all and sundry . The one that extends over the time limitation is banned as destructive to public morals ! Kissing as a forfeit is a part of many old games and customs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most familiar instances . In colonial New England , if a man succeeded in gaining possession of a girl 's gloves , according to custom , he could claim a kiss as forfeit for their return . There is an old English custom analogous to this , although acting somewhat in reverse : If a man is caught sleeping and is kissed by a woman , he is obliged to present her with a pair of gloves . There are a number of so-called kissing games which were popular in the parlor entertainment era , in which the kiss takes place as a forfeit at some point in the game . Such games as " Post Office , " " Pillow , " " Drop the Handkerchief , " and " In a Well " are representative of this group . In the game of whist that was popular before its almost total eclipse by contract bridge , it was the custom in some circles that if the four cards played to a trick ever fell in the sequence of ace ( one ) , deuce ( two ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card might claim a kiss of the dealer ? // if the dealer happened to be someone he wished to kiss ! Some of the old English folksongs , such as " The Farmer in i lie Dell , " " King William Was King James 's Son , " and " The Needle 's Eye " used as ring-games by children , have kissing as an integral part . The old nursery remedy of " Kiss it and make it well " proves quite efficacious in drying the tears and assuaging the minor Hurts and bruises of babyhood . Incidentally , it seems a natural instinct to put a hurt finger or hand to the mouth . THE PLATONIC KISS There is the salutation of the kiss as a form of greeting , which may be either casual or formal , among men . This kiss , which may be given on both cheeks , or either cheek , is prevalent in France and certain other parts of continental Europe . It is often part of the greeting in formal ceremonies when eminent dignitaries meet . In itself , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English-speaking world , but is an added gesture , expressive of the vivacity and effervescence of the Latin temperament . In any event it may be considered a platonic , or E ) assionless , kiss . Probably in the case of the formal ceremonial salutation , particularly among high political dignitaries , it may sometimes turn out to be a Judas-kiss . In the same countries , kissing among male relatives and intimate friends as a greeting , or even at casual meetings , is quite common . Kissing among adults as a form of greeting in countries of the English-speaking world is almost exclusively restricted to the female sex , or between men and women . It is also customary in some of the continental European countries , in the more formal social circles , for the gentleman to kiss the lady 's hand as a greeting . This form of salutation , which takes the place of the handshake , is sometimes seen in this country when practiced by visiting foreigners . Some of // our own repatriated countrymen , after " living abroad , may affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KISSING BY CORRESPONDENCE No treatise on kissing would be complete without mention of the lover 's kiss in the epistle of love . The row of crosses or " x 's " at the foot of the letter is as unmistakable as the contact of the lips , if less satisfying . A more sophisticated method , however , for the modern maid to show the seal of her affection is to make it quite literal : Lips well rouged by the lipstick , when pressed to the page of the letter , leave an impression which the recipient will recognize as coming direct from the lips of the loved one . A QUAINT CUSTOM OF COURTSHIP Bundling is one of the quaint practices that seems to have had independent existence among alien peoples in widely separated areas of many coun-tries . As is now widely known from the rather amusing treat-ment of the theme on stage and screen , as well as from more serious presentations , the characteristic feature of the custom is for a man and woman to lie together in bed without undress-ing . Local traditions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or another , including the dividing board , but the identifying feature remained . It is commonly thought to have been a custom peculiar to early rural New England and some of the other Eastern Atlantic states , but it was not essentially Yankee either as invention or monopoly . The Yankees merely adopted an old custom . This fallacy with respect to origin is due to some extent to misinformation from old sources , such as Grose 's Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue , which defined the practice as follows : " Bundling ? A man and woman lying on the same bed with their clothes on ; an expedient practiced in America on account of a scarcity of beds , where as occasion necessitated , husbands and parents frequently permitted travelers to bundle with their wives and daughters . " Scarcity of beds may have been something of a problem in 95 // early colonial America , but it is doubtful if this had much to do with bundling . It was often necessary to double up , and perhaps triple and quadruple up , in bed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bundling travelers indiscriminately with wives and daughters . Public inns also permitted several unassociated guests to sleep together in one bed , and to keep their clothes on for the sake of comfort and warmth ? the only stipulation being that they should remove their boots . ( Organ-grinders and tinkers slept in the barn . ) The phase of bundling under discussion is that relating to courtship ? the practice as it involved the young woman and ? the young man in their courting days , or more literally nights , and as a normal but not inevitable preliminary to marriage . The rigors of climate , no less than the limitation of household facilities , seem to have been a large factor in the custom , as it prevailed not only in New England and the adjacent states , but throughout the countries of Northern Europe , England , Scotland , Wales , the Netherlands , Scandinavia , Germany and Switzerland , and doubtless other countries of similar culture and climate . Each country had its major or minor variations , and also its rules governing the ethics of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very strict regulations , with severe penalties for violations , to the greatest possible freedom of conduct . In Holland , it is said that if the lover exceeded the limits set by custom , he was very harshly dealt with by the people of the village . In New England the winters are long and cold , and at the period in question candlelight and fuel were not to be wasted . Dwellings generally were far apart . After the young swain had done a hard day 's work around his father 's farm and went calling on his sweetheart at perhaps a considerable distance , // sitting in the chilly , dimly lighted room during the evening was certainly not conducive either to common comfort or romantic thoughts . Under the circumstances , relaxing together fully clothed in bed under a warm New England goose-down quilt was an understandable , and not illogical , thing to do . Perhaps in some cases , as an observer has stated , the young man has walked ten or more weary miles on a Sunday evening to enjoy the company of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elapse before the morning light should call him again to his homeward trek and his week 's toil , was it not the dictate of humanity , as well as of economy , which prompted the old folks to allow the approved and accepted suitor of their daughter to pursue his wooing under the downy coverlet of a good feather bed ? ofttimes in the very same room in which they themselves slept ? rather than have them sit up and burn firewood and candles uselessly ? In the rural districts , where the practice of bundling chiefly occurred , many , perhaps the majority of the dwellings of early settlers , consisted of one large room , in which the whole family lived and slept . This fact alone would tend to keep abuses of the privilege down to a minimum . Furthermore , before the intimacy had developed this far , it is likely that the couple were engaged , or it was tacitly understood they were entering that stage of courtship . It is not very likely that every Tom , Dick and Harry called on successive evenings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thus more or less a prerogative of the engaged couple , or of the couple who were accepted as courting with matrimonial intentions . In former times , too , the fact of having called at the home of a girl was in itself evidence of serious intentions . Nevertheless , there were the natural factors of climate , // limited household facilities and hardy living that favored the custom . As evidence of this , it may be stated that bundling took place only in the cold seasons of the year . Sociologists tell us that the practice in itself was never proof of licentious manners . Generally speaking , the proprieties seem usually to have been observed , although lapses in con-duct , human nature being what it is , sometimes occurred . Bundling was an old institution in both Holland and Eng-land , and it is likely that the custom was brought to this coun-try by early settlers ? the Dutch in New Amsterdam , and the English in New England , as reference to it goes back to the first settlement . Early historians began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon as evidence of rustic coarse-ness and vulgarity , or downright bad form , although it con-tinued in a decreasing measure long after their words were written . Some treated the matter critically ; others heaped sarcasm upon it . Still others blamed the erring ways of a neighboring colony for introducing the custom into their own midst . Ministers , particularly in the cities and towns , fulminated against the sinful custom . In order to lend discouragement to the practice , the more sophisticated element introduced sofas into the household . The country people thought the new device less proper ? a heathen Turkish importation with the connotations of the harem ? and maintained there was more sinning on city sofas than on rural beds . The courts , too , were in due course drawn into the con-troversy to decide on the legal merits of seduction claims that grew out of the practice . By this time the custom was fast nearing its end , and the notice of the law was but a final gesture to a passing folkway. // Washington Irving , in his Knickerbocker 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the inventive genius of the Connecticut Yankees , implying that it fostered immorality . He wrote of " the curious device among these sturdy barbarians ( the Connecticut colonists ) , to keep up a harmony of interests and to promote the population . They multiplied to a degree which would be incredible to any man unacquainted with the marvelous fecundity of this young country . This amazing increase may , indeed , be partly ascribed to a singular custom prevalent among them , commonly known by the name of bundling ? a superstitious rite observed by the young people of both sexes , with which they usually terminated their festivities , and which was kept up with religious strictness by the more bigoted and vulgar of the community . " This ceremony was likewise , in those primitive times , considered as an indispensable preliminary to matrimony ; their courtships commencing where ours usually finish , by which means they acquired that intimate acquaintance with each other before marriage , which has been pronounced by philosophers the sure basis of a happy union . Thus early did this cunning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has ever since distinguished thorn , and a strict adherence to the good old vulgar maxim about buying a pig in a poke : " To this sagacious custom , therefore , do I chiefly attribute the unparalleled increase of the Yanokie or Yankee tribe ; for it is a certain fact , well authenticated by court records and parish registers , that wherever the practice of bundling prevailed , there was an amazing number of sturdy brats annually born unto the state , without the license of the law or the benefit of clergy . Neither did the irregularity of their birth operate // in the least to their disparagement . On the contrary , they grew up a long-sided , raw-boned , hardy race of whoreson whalers , wood cutters , fishermen and peddlers ; and strapping corn-fed wenches , who by their united efforts tended marvelously toward populating those notable tracts of country called Nan-tucket , Piscataway and Cape Cod . " Washington Irving was undoubtedly amusing at the ex-pense of being accurate . The Reverend Samuel Peters of the same Connecticut came heartily to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , testifying to the modesty and virtue of their women . The beginning of the decline of bundling seems to have come about in New England and adjacent states in the late eighteenth century , when the more fastidious members of the population began to decry the custom and forbade the practice under their roof . As late as 1776 , a clergyman from one of the more conventional towns went into the country and is said to have preached against the unchristian custom of young men and maidens lying together on a bed . Upon leaving the church , he was besieged by the women of the congregation who re-sented his strictures and their reflections upon themselves and their daughters . Other defenders of the custom , testifying to the high esteem in which it was held , said there was something satisfying and homey to the domestic instinct in having the old ladies , as often happened , look in before retiring to see that the bun-dling couple were comfortable , and possibly tuck them in or put on more bed clothes , if necessary . Most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saw its decline insisted " there was n't any more mischief done in those days than there is now . " Dr. Henry Reed Stiles , in his book on the subject , states that // the custom was widely practiced among the Dutch settlers in Pennsylvania , and that traces of it continued down well into the nineteenth century . He cites the case of an old schoolmaster in his teaching experience in Southern Pennsylvania . The schoolmaster used to board around , and when it was not convenient to go to his usual boarding place for the time being , he was accustomed to stop at a tavern kept by an honest old Dutchman . On one occasion , having asked the landlord if he could stay overnight , he was told he could , and after chatting with his host through the evening , was shown to bed . The landlord set down the candle and had gone out of the room , when the schoolmaster noticed that the only bed in the room was already occupied , and calling to his host , informed him of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh ! dat ish only mine taughter , she wo n't hurt nopoty , " and went on his way . Visitors , unfamiliar with bundling , uniformly remarked how innocently those accustomed to it looked upon the practice . The open sanction of the custom by the parents and the community must have had the effect of inspiring in the young folks a sense of restraint from what was known to be wrong , and a strong incentive to doing right . There was , too , the close supervision by the elders that was inevitable on account of the limitation of space in the home . TARRYING A somewhat similar custom , known as tarrying , is reported as having had a considerable following in certain parts of the colonies concurrently with and subsequent to the reign of bundling . Under this practice , when a young man wished to marry a girl , he made known his intention to the parents . If they were agreeable , he was allowed to tarry with her for one night , in order to pay his court . At the usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young folks to settle matters as best they could . After having sat up as long as the conventions seemed to require , they got in bed together , but without taking off their underclothes . If the parties were still of the same mind by morning , all was consid-ered well . The banns were published and the marriage took place without delay . If the tarrying did not work out to the satisfaction of the couple , they parted , possibly never to see each other again . The final disappearance of bundling as a social custom in America has been attributed to a number of causes . First and foremost , of course , was the gradual elimination of the princi-pal factors which did so much to start it and make it popular . That is , housing and living facilities were much improved , dwellings became less isolated as the country became more thickly populated , and with the change in these physical ele-ments , there gradually came a change of mind toward the practice . With the development of a more fastidious and conven-tional viewpoint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custom and an evidence of warm-hearted hospitality became an anachronism ? something not quite decent or re-spectable , and at the same time a little ridiculous , as the many barbs of derision and ridicule that were hurled at it fully reveal . BUNDLING IN OTHER LANDS The custom in England , Scot-land and Northern Continental Europe , while much older than in its transplanted form in America ? having been a social inheritance from feudal times ? nevertheless passed out in much the same manner . It had outlived its usefulness and its time . Not only has bundling been traced to numerous countries and provinces in the feudal ages ? being distinctly a practice // of rural people , of rude social status ? but Professor William Graham Sumner states that the Christians in the third and fourth centuries practiced it , even without the limiting conditions which were set in the Middle Ages . Bundling was a means then used to test themselves by extreme temptation . It was a test or proof of the power of moral rule over natural impulse . A number of sects in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of great temptation . Individuals , too , believing they were practicing holiness by carrying on the battle between " the flesh " and " the spirit " subjected themselves to similar tests . For centuries bundling , or analogous customs , prevailed in all sections of the British Isles . Even at the time of the Roman conquest the promiscuous sleeping together which prevailed there led Caesar to consider the Britons polyandrous polygamists . Other ancient writers offered similar comment . This was bundling in its crudest primordial form . The social histories of England , Ireland , Scotland and Wales all abound in stories of courtship and marriage customs that come within the sociological order of bundling . Very often each section had its own peculiar variation , and with it there developed an ethic which they recognized and respected , although it may have been lost to an outside observer , who saw only the crudity of the practice . For instance , there was the so-called " island custom " of Portland , England , which lasted well into the nineteenth century . According to the custom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lover until pregnant and then married him . She was always strictly faithful to him while they lived together , but if no pregnancy occurred the couple might decide that they were not meant for each other , and break off re104 STRANGE CUSTOMS OF lations . As a result , for a long period of years no illegitimate children were born , and few marriages were childless . With the development of the Portland stone industry , workmen were imported from London who promptly took advantage of the convenient " island custom " , but refused to fulfil the obligation of marriage when pregnancy occurred . This outside trifling and playing false with what was a long established , seriously considered local custom caused the custom to fall into disuse . The social conditions of primitive , rural Wales , like those of the other Celtic countries ? Scotland and Ireland ? are said to have been more rude in the sexual relationships than in England at a comparable period . Always , however , we find at the root of these problems that all-pervading nemesis of early humanity ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the custom in eighteenth-century Ireland . B. B. Woodward , in his history of Wales , re-creates the following picture of the domestic habits of the people at an earlier period : At night a bed of rushes was laid down along one side of the hovel , covered with a coarse kind of cloth , made in the country , called brychan . All the household lay down on this bed in common , without changing their garments . The fire was kept burning through the night , and the sleepers kept warm by lying huddled closely . When , by the hardness of their bed , one side was wearied , they got up , sat by the fire for a while , and then lay down again on the other side . It was this custom of promiscuous sleeping that accounted for what was considered by many observers at a much later date as a great moral laxness among the population , with an absence of feminine delicacy among the women . Out of this aboriginal practice , which influenced the amatory life of the // Welsh peasants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The custom of hand f asting among the old Scotch , which will be considered in a subsequent chapter , bore a close relationship to the sexual habits already described . Suffice to say at this point that a witness before the Royal Commission on the Marriage Laws in 1868 testified that " night visiting " ( a form of bundling ) was still common among the laboring classes in some parts of Scotland . In extenuation , the witness said they have no other means of intercourse . It was contrary to custom for a lover to visit his sweetheart by day ? doubtless because he did not have the time , and the lass had no time for him either . The parents condoned the practice because " Their daughters must have husbands and there is no other way of courting . " The custom had considerable vogue and no little prestige in Holland under the name of queesten . It is said that parents encouraged it . A girl who had no queester was considered lacking in some desirable feminine qualities . The houses in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are told that in 1666 ? 1667 every house on the island of Texel had an opening under the window where the lover could enter so as to sit on the bed and spend the night making love to the daughter of the house . So stringent was the code of the folkway governing the practice that rarely did any harm occur . If it did , the man was mobbed and wounded or killed . The custom can be traced in North Holland down to the eighteenth century . In Norway the practice was called night-running , on account of the long distance between the homesteads . The routine in that country was for the girl to put on several extra skirts and go to bed . In due time the young man entered by the door or 106 window and took his place in bed alongside of her . They talked all night , or until overcome by weariness and fell asleep . The custom existed among the peasants of Germany down to recent times , but in some sections it was restricted to one night in the month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peoples who practiced bundling everywhere there seems to have been the common denominator of poverty , or at least the necessity of observing the utmost economy . It was essentially a rural custom among hard-working , frugalliving peasants who after their day 's toil found an occasional evening free to answer the call of the mating instinct . PROMISCUITY We have already observed Westermarck 's theory that marriage in some form , however shadowy the out-line may have been in many instances , has existed from the beginning of human society . We also have the testimony of other anthropologists that the sexual relationship at the earli-est stages of mankind must inevitably have been promiscuous , a sort of indiscriminate sexual communism . In support of the latter contention , we have a great deal of evidence from pioneer investigators of primitives within his-toric times , and also of sociologists , ethnologists and other pro-fessional observers of human nature in its most uninhibited state in modern times . Primitive man , in whom the sexual impulse was still purely instinctive , of course , had no knowledge of marriage in any-thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is probable that the men in a horde or tribe or clan cohabited quite indiscriminately with the women of the group . If there were any distinctions made , or preferences shown , they were probably based on physical force . This , however , does not alter the fact of the promiscuous relationship . Under those conditions it was of course impossible to determine the pa-ternity of children , so that the offspring belonged to their mothers or to the tribe . 107 // GROUP MARRIAGE In the case of the smaller nomadic units , this promiscuous relationship within the group may well have resembled what Westermarck designated as a form of marriage . This would be considered an example of group marriage , a practice that has had considerable prevalence both in ancient and , among uncivilized races , in more recent times . Group marriage is the marriage of one totem with another ? that is , the men of one totem group marry the women of another , and vice versa . No individual man , however , has any particular wife . To illustrate , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second totem , then each one of the dozen men has an equal share of each of the dozen women , and vice versa . This , of course , represents an advance over unrestricted sexual promiscuity , and is the basis of family life in many primitive societies . Group marriages have existed down to recent years ? and perhaps even at the present time ? among the Australian aborigines and certain other primitives . The prevalence of group marriage among our own early ancestors is revealed in the following statement of Julius Caesar , in his description of the marital practices of ancient Britain : " The husbands possess their wives to the number of ten or twelve in common , and more especially brothers with brothers , or parents with children . " This is a special form of group marriage , there being variations in the detailed arrangement according to the folkways that shaped the social life of the people . Polyandry ? the espousal of one woman and several men ? is also regarded by some authorities as the vestige of a primitive form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a totem . Under this arrangement one woman was // left as the representative of a totem married to several hus-bands . Mythology , which arises from the beliefs and practices of the childhood of humanity , confirms the indiscriminate and unrestrained sexual relationships of prehistoric times . In the Indian myth Brama is wedded to his own daughter Saravasti . The same myth occurs among the Egyptians and in the Norse " Edda . " The Egyptian god , Ammon , was the husband of his mother , and boasted of the fact ; and Odin , the Norse god , is referred to as the husband of one of his own daughters . The sexual rela-tionship of certain of the Egyptian dynastic rulers in early historic times bears out the analogy of the myth to fact . If we were as well acquainted with the marital customs of India and the Norse countries at a corresponding period , it is likely that we should find similar practices , as we do indeed among cer-tain savage tribes . Writers of Greco-Latin antiquity have cited numerous graphic instances of promiscuity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country the people lead a nomad life . Each tribe has its chief , or tyrant . The women and the children are possessed in common , with the exception of the wives and children of the chief , and whoever is guilty of adultery with one of the wives of the chief is punished by a fine consisting of the payment of a goat . " Herodotus described the Agathyrses ( Scythians ) as the most delicate of men , their ornaments being chiefly of gold . They have their women in common , he reported , in order that they may all be brothers , and that , being so nearly related , they may feel neither hatred nor envy toward each other . In the Andaman Islands , the women were said to have been held in common until quite recently . Every woman belonged // to all the men of the tribe , and resistance to any of them was a crime severely punished . According to Major Ross King , some aboriginal tribes of India , notably the Kouroumbas and the Iroulas , have no idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibitory rule consisted in not having intimate relations with a person belonging to another class or caste . Strabo affirmed a similar practice among the Celtic population of ancient Ierne ( Ireland ) . The custom seems to have been prevalent in antiquity throughout the British Isles , which were then inhabited by various barbarous tribes or clans , as noted by explorers from the Mediterranean civilization . Dr. Adolf Bastian , in describing his travels in the Orient , reports that in Swaganwara the daughters of the Rajah enjoyed the privilege of freely choosing their husbands . Four brothers who settled in Kapilapur made Priya , the eldest of their five sisters , queen-mother , and married the others . THE CONSANGUINEOUS FAMILY Lewis H. Morgan , the American ethnologist , who did so much to interpret the form of family life and social organization of the Indian tribes , particularly the Iroquois , indicates the principles of the consanguineous family , which he assumes as a higher form of the sexual relation that gradually developed from the state of general promiscuity . Under this form the marriage groups are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain family group are mutually husbands and wives . Their children constitute another cycle of husbands and wives . And , again , the children of these , when they have attained the proper age , are mutually married . This may be described as a form of group marriage limited // to one generation . Brothers and sisters and cousins of the first , second and more remote grades are all acknowledged as brothers and sisters , and also as husbands and wives . Morgan , through his long study of Indian life in particular and of ethnology in general , which included living for years with the existing tribes as a virtual member of the group , did more than any other authority to throw a revealing light upon their forms of social organization and government . He was the first to discover the identity existing between the totem groups of the North American Indian and the gentile organizations of the Romans . The most famous cases of consanguineous marriage within historic times , of course , are those of the Egyptian dynastic ruling family , the Ptolemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CUSTOM OF EXCHANGING WIVES The custom of temporarily exchanging wives and lending wives to visitors has been observed in many parts of the world . Among the Banyankoles in Central Africa , when a man and his wife visited a friend , they invariably exchanged wives during the time of the visit . A similar custom prevailed among the natives of the Hawaiian Islands . Marco Polo wrote that in Eastern Tibet no man considered it dishonorable if a foreigner had relations with his wife oz daughter or sister or other woman of the family . On the con , trary , it was deemed an act of good fortune . Such was their superstition that they considered it would bring the favor of their gods and idols , and presaged an increase in temporal prosperity . Among others it was thought that the lending of their wives to foreigners would result in nobler offspring . This is an // exogamous concept that has had wide prevalence in one form or another among many primitives , often forming part of their religious rites . The exchanging of wives is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreeable to the man and his wife . Sometimes the exchange is made for what appears to be practical reasons . For instance , if a man who is going on a journey has a wife encumbered with a child that would add to the difficulties of traveling , he may exchange wives with some friend who remains in camp and has no such inconvenience . Or , a man will want a younger wife to travel with him , in which case an exchange can usually be effected . It is not necessary to have any particular reason , however , as the custom is so thoroughly established in Eskimo folkways that among friends it is the usual thing to exchange wives for a week or two every few months . At the time of tribal gatherings or general festivities , it is one of the principal diversions . Occasionally it turns out that the exchange reveals to both couples a more satisfactory or harmonious relation , in which case the exchange is made permanent . There are also superstitions that govern the exchanging of wives . After the incantations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hudson Bay Eskimos , it is obligatory to exchange wives . The women must spend the night in the huts of the men to whom they are assigned . If any woman should refuse to go to the man to whom she is assigned , it is believed she would be sure to be taken sick . The only stipulation entering into this ceremonial exchange is that the man and the woman in question must not be near relatives . It is also believed that the practice is efficacious in averting some great trouble , such as pestilence or illness that may threaten them . Among the Himalayan mountaineers , the exchange of wives // was a usual practice when two of the men became disgusted with their respective spouses and hoped thereby to effect an improved domestic arrangement . MAGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF RITES The relationship between marriage , with its normal sequence of offspring , and the productivity of fields has been dramatized by all primitive peoples . Marriage rites are used that are appropriate to and timely with the planting and harvesting of crops , and frequently at no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceived to bring productiveness to the marriage , or whether the marriage is believed to favorably influence the crops , is a moot question . It is quite likely that the belief may embrace both concepts ? a magic working both ways , stimulating alike the fertility of the marriage and of the fields . In Morocco marriages are celebrated generally in the autumn , at the close of the harvest when the granaries are full of corn . In some sections of the country , a wedding is seldom known to be performed at any other time . The peasantry of many European countries have also favored the autumn , corresponding to the period of the agricultural festival . This is notable in its departure from the traditional late spring preference , especially the month of June , so much favored by the peoples of the English-speaking world . Even this , it will be noted , is a seasonal selection of important significance , as it corresponds with the time when the planting season is normally completed . Among the Brahmans of India there are but four months in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? during which marriage may be celebrated . Only in this season is it considered a favorable time for marrying . The plebeians of ancient Rome celebrated their great festival , the Cerealia , in honor of Ceres , goddess of the grain , during the period April 12-19. // In China , too , the spring season is especially favored for promising marriages , although the last month of the year ? corresponding with the completion of the harvest ? is also considered desirable . The Votyak of Kasan still retain the ancient custom of marrying at a definite period of the year , which is before the hay harvest , about the end of June . The celebration of May Day ( the name popularly given to the first day of May ) throughout Europe can be traced back to , and is a survival of , rites originally offered to the old Roman goddess Maia , who was worshiped as the principle and cause of fertility . One of the essential features of this celebration was a ritual marriage of the goddess to a partner who represented the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts of license which , however , were not repugnant to early moral sentiment . The Roman Floralia , celebrated in honor of Flora , the goddess of flowers and of the spring , superseded the devotions to Maia . It was instituted in Rome in the year 238 B.C. , on account of a bad harvest , the celebration taking place between April 28th and May 3rd . Among the observances of the Floralia are mentioned gay costumes , dramatic performances and dances described as frequently extremely sexual in character , but to the ancients merely emphasizing the procreative character of the rites . The importance attributed by the ancients to their gods and goddesses of fertility , and the necessity of paying homage to them in order to benefit by the spell of their magic , is clearly indicated by the fact that the Romans had no less than three major divinities ? Ceres , Maia and Flora ? of this character . There were also other lesser and local divinities of fertility , who were propitiated by acts and suggestions of procreation . In modern India the Holi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing of songs generally erotic in their implications . The naturalistic basis of the custom is joy at the creative impulses felt in the spring and manifested both in the vegetable and animal world . Even now among the peasantry of various European countries , spring and midsummer festivals are celebrated with bonfires , music and dancing , always associated with love- and match-making . So May Day has come down through the centuries with traditions bearing on the fruitfulness and productivity of nature , as revealed by man , and the flora and fauna upon which his welfare , even his very life , depends . It was all of magical beginnings . In civilized times , it has lost most of its grosser outward manifestations , although retaining the symbolic significance that gave it being , even to the May Pole , which is admittedly phallic in origin . LICENTIOUSNESS AT CERTAIN FEASTS Among various peoples promiscuous sexual relations are indulged in at certain feasts . This is thought to be a survival of a more general ancient promiscuity , later limited to seasonal festivals . However , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a magical rite . The Koko-nor Tibetans held a celebration known as t'iao mao hui , " the hat-choosing festival . " During the two or three days the feast lasts a man may carry off the cap of any girl or woman he meets in the temple grounds who pleases him , and she is obliged to come at night and redeem the pledge . In Madagascar orgies of great licentiousness formerly accompanied the birth of a child in the royal family . On such an occasion the streets and lanes of the capital were the scenes of unrestrained caprice , and the period during which the debauchery lasted was called andro-tsi-maty , meaning a time // when the law could not condemn nor the penalty of death be inflicted . TREE MARRIAGE Tree marriages , among other forms of mock nuptials , are widely prevalent in various parts of India . Among the Brahmans of southern India it is the established custom that a younger brother should not marry before an older one . To fulfil this requirement , when there is no satis-factory bride in sight for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which leaves the younger one at liberty to take a wife . According to the theory of animism ? which is universal among primitive peoples ? all animate and inanimate objects possess a spirit . The brother who is married to the tree is in reality married to the spirit which resides in the tree . This cus-tom shows remarkable ingenuity in overcoming a convention prejudicial to the interests of certain individuals , and still satis-fies the demands of the folkways . In other cases tree marriages occur simultaneously with the regular marriage of the couple , the idea being to divert to the tree some evil influence which would otherwise attach to the newly wedded pair . Mock marriages are also carried out among the Punjab of India in the case of a widower taking his third wife . It is cele-brated with a certain tree or bush , and sometimes with a sheep , which is dressed up as a bride and is led by the groom around the sacrificial fire while the real bride rests near by . This act is a precaution against a train of ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in order to insure protection to the new wife . It is believed that the malicious jealousy of the first wife has been instrumental in causing the death of the second one , and the characteristic features of this ceremony are to divert such evil influences to the substitute in the mock marriage . We use the term " mock marriage , " but it // is all very serious with them . In the case of a widower taking a fourth wife , it is believed that the evil influence of the first wife has spent itself , and therefore no mock marriage is deemed necessary . CIRCUMCISION AS A PREREQUISITE OF MARRIAGE The importance of circumcision in the limited culture of primitive peoples is attested by the fact that it is conceded to be the oldest surgical operation . Furthermore , it is still the most widely practiced form of surgery , and the only one having a mystical or religious significance . Leaving aside the general practice among the Jews , Mohammedans and certain Christian sects , such as the Abyssinians , Bogos and Copts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incident to marriage . Among the tribes that so consider it are most of the natives of the West Coast of Africa , the Kafirs , nearly all the peoples of Eastern and Central Africa , Madagascar , the aborigines of Australia , Melanesia , the Indian Archipelago , Polynesia and many of the Indian tribes of the Western Hemisphere . There is undoubtedly magic significance attached to it among these peoples , as there was to its origin among the Jews , Mohammedans and those Christian sects who continued it as a religious rite . That it was originally considered the physical symbol of spiritual purification is indicated by several references in Romans ii , of which it is only necessary to quote the following : " and circumcision is that of the heart , in the spirit , not in the letter " ( verse 29 ) . The importance of the rite among primitive peoples un doubtedly rests on the fact that it makes the boy a man , and gives him the appearance of sexual maturity . This in turn signifies he is capable of procreation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it results in this outward appearance , 118 then , in the logic of the primitive mind , there must be some favorable connection between the practice and the benign spirits . In those communities where circumcision is a prerequisite of marriage , eligible girls would not think of considering an uncircumcised youth as a prospective mate . The folkways with respect to this custom are so thoroughly established that it would be thought indecent and objectionable to show encouragement to a youth who had not been initiated by undergoing this tribal rite . Among many peoples of Africa and certain natives of the Malay Archipelago and South America , the girls also undergo a ritual analogous to circumcision , which is also looked upon as a necessary preliminary to marriage . Whether the practice applies to one sex or both , it is always a serious obligation , one of the most sacred rites performed by the tribe . SUTTEE A hideous practice which prevailed in India from legendary times down to the present century was suttee , the burning or immolation of the widow on the funeral pyre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he died at a distance . The word is an English corruption from the Sanskrit sati , meaning " true wife " or " good woman . " The custom was based on injunctions of the orthodox Hindus ' religious teachings . It appears to have originated among the Indian royalty as a " wifely privilege " , and afterwards became generalized and made legal under the native laws . Akbar , the Mogul emperor , acting from his Mohammedan viewpoint , forbade the suttee about i600 . His rule had no effect whatever on the practice . In the year 1803 there were 275 women sacrificed on funeral pyres within a radius of thirty miles of Calcutta . In six months of the year 1804 , in the same area , the number was 115 . The British Government outlawed the practice in 1829 , but so strong was the custom that it continued in isolated parts of India as late as 1905 , when several persons who had partici-pated in a suttee in Behar were condemned to penal servitude . When the rite was suppressed under British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appealing to the Veda , as sanctioning the ordinance , and demanding that the foreign rulers respect the native religious law . It was proven , however , // that the priests had actually falsified their sacred Veda in support of the rite , which was based on long and inveterate practice , and not on the traditional standards of Hindu faith . For a long time after suttee had been suppressed , it was said that the prohibitory law was not a kindness to widows , as their continued existence was so wretched that death would have been preferable . They were subjected to physical abuse and mental torture , and shunned as creatures of ill omen . Usually the wife went willingly to the sacrifice , but force was used if she showed reluctance . Often one dead man took many wives with him . Some went eagerly , even gaily to the new life , many were driven by force of custom , by fear of disgrace , by family persuasion , by priestly threats and promises , or , if necessary , by sheer violence . Widow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state of low civilization . Tylor finds traces of a rite similar to suttee among ancient Aryan nations in Europe ? Greece , Scandinavia , Germany , the Slavonic countries ? and accounts for it by direct inheritance from the common antiquity of them all . Striking examples are found in both myth and early historical writings . In Greek lore we learn of the Trojan captives laid with the horses and hounds on the funeral pyre of Patroklos , of Evadne throwing herself into the funeral pile of her husband , and Pausanias 's account of the suicide of the three Messenian widows . In Scandinavian myth Baldr is burned with his dwarf foot-page , his horse and saddle . Brynhild throws herself on the pyre of her beloved Sigurd , and men and maids follow after them to Valhalla . The Gauls , in Caesar 's time , burned at the dead man 's elaborate funeral whatever he held dear . Old Slavonic legends describe the burning of the dead with clothing and weapons , // horses and hounds , faithful servants , and , above all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love with so great zeal that the wife might refuse to survive her husband , and she was held praiseworthy among women who slayed herself by her own hand , that she might be burned on one pyre with her lord . The primitive theory of this seems to be that the departed husband shall enjoy the company of his wife , and others as the case may be , in the other world . There was also the belief that a widow is dangerous because the ghost of her husband clings to her after his departure . She is therefore taboo , and must be slain that his spirit may depart in peace with her . Even in modern times the custom has been widely followed by savage tribes in many parts of the world . Among the Comanches it was the practice to kill the man 's wife to accompany him on his journey . In various parts of Africa wives were sacrificed at the death of their husbands . This was also the case in the New Hebrides , New Guinea , Melanesia and the Fiji Islands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his concubines . Similar customs , with slightly different ceremonial forms , prevailed among some of the Chinese and Japanese peoples ; also among the Tartars , and a number of Indian tribes of the Western Hemisphere . THE PURDAH Another custom working great hardship on women is the purdah , literally keeping them out of sight . The name originated from a curtain , which was supposed to shield all respectable women from the gaze of men , other than those of the immediate family . It was formerly quite universal in the Mohammedan countries , especially Turkey , Persia , and India . The woman who sits behind a curtain is termed a purdahnashim. // The purdah supplemented the veil worn over the face of the Moslem women , before the dynamic Kemal Ataturk banished both from Turkey into which he introduced so many modern innovations during his brief but spectacular career . The custom , while declining , is still maintained by some traditional upper-class Mohammedans who have not been too drastically affected by the changes of the twentieth century , especially those brought about by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is part and parcel of the oriental tendency to seclude or segregate women , to keep them apart from , and out of contact with , the normal activities of life , except those that revolved around the exclusive sphere of the husband . The term has been absorbed into the English vernacular in the phrase " to lift the purdah , " meaning to divulge a secret . FAMILY LIFE AMONG THE SIMIANS In a treatise on primitive marriage practices it will be pertinent to make brief mention of the family habits of man 's closest subhuman relatives , the simians . We are considering , of course , the animals in their native habitat and wild state , as no particular significance can be placed upon the actions of those placed together in captivity , in an entirely artificial environment . It is therefore necessary to depend upon the reports of naturalists who have spent considerable time living and traveling in regions inhabited by the animals . Max Moszkowski , writing on his travels in Sumatra , states that the higher monkeys or apes usually live in families consisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. de Crespigny , reporting on his sojourn in Borneo , gives the following description of the orang-utan : " They live in families ? the male , female and a young one . On one occasion , I found a // family in which were two young ones , one of them much larger than the other , which I took as proof that the family tie had existed for at least two seasons . They build commodious nests in the trees which form their feeding ground , and , so far as I could observe , the nests , which are well lined with dry leaves , are only occupied by the female and young , the male passing the night in a fork of the same or another tree in the vicinity . The nests are very numerous all over the forest ; for they are not occupied above a few nights , the orang-utan leading a roving life . " Hornaday and Wallace found the orang generally quite solitary in his habits , the old males invariably being alone . They did find , however , adult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oldest offspring , apparently from the previous year , who had not yet left his mother 's side to shift for himself . Adult males were also less frequently seen accompanied by half-grown young ones . The testimony regarding gorillas is more specific . They have been observed to live in small bands , usually with but one adult male in each group . It is said that when the male first realizes he is seen , he gives a terrific yell that resounds far and wide through the forest . At the first cry the females and young quickly disappear . He then approaches the enemy in great fury , giving vent to his dreadful cries in quick succession . Winwood Read mentions that when a family of gorillas ascend a tree to eat a certain fruit , the old father remains seated at the foot of the tree on guard . When the female is pregnant he builds a rude nest , usually about fifteen or twenty feet from the ground . Here she is delivered and the nest is then abandoned . The male is said to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the female and the young from the nocturnal attacks of leopards . An instance is men-124 tioned where a band of gorillas was attacked by two Bulu men . The old gorilla of the band first got his family out of danger and then returned to the encounter . The family life of the chimpanzee was found to be very similar . Georg Schweinfurth relates that this ape also is found either in pairs or even quite alone , only the young being seen usually in groups . T. S. Savage seldom observed more than one or two nests upon the same tree or in the same neighborhood . Unlike the monkey , they do not live in villages , and are more often seen in pairs than in groups . The same author says it is not unusual to see " the old folks " sitting under a tree regaling themselves with fruit and friendly chat , while their children are leaping around them and swinging from branch to branch in boisterous merriment . It is not only the simians that live in a more or less durable union . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whales , seals , certain of the antelopes , reindeer , gazelles , and among the smaller animals , squirrels , moles , the ichneumon , and of course many species of birds . Thus we see that the pairing instinct , coexistent with the parental care of offspring , is very extensive throughout nature , extending far into the subhuman world . It clearly indicates that mankind has by no means a monopoly of the impulse to mate and care for his young over a prolonged period of time . Being necessary for the existence of certain species , the instinct has been fostered by the process of natural selection . So primitive marriage practices , or family life , have indeed a very long biological background . Mankind does not always seem to have made the most of his heritage . MARRIAGE AND THE GREAT RELIGIONS The great religions of the world ? Judaism , Hinduism , Buddhism , Christianity and Mohammedanism , to list them in the order of their seniority ? have exercised vast influence upon marital ideas , and the cere-monies and ritual connected with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made lesser contributions to the subject , as they have for the most part continued the general practices of the parent body , with cer-tain variations , and all modified to some extent by the tradi tional influences of their own environment . When it is stated that the great religions have exercised such influence , it is not to be inferred that the authority of religion over marriage began with the rise of these respective religious bodies . Considering religion in its broadest sense , i.e. , belief in a supernatural power or spirit , there has been a religious jurisdiction over marriage since long before the dawn of history . Ages before there existed the concept of a personal divinity , there was a belief in a multiplicity of gods , dominating all the unknown and mysterious phenomena that surrounded and be-wildered primordial man . There was animism ? the association of a spirit with all sorts of animate and inanimate objects . There was magic , which ex-125 // ercised so powerful a hold upon the primitive mind , and still does , to a greater extent than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rational of all the early forms of adoration of a higher power . And there were various forms of mysticism , fetishism , shamanism , phallicism , and many other religious isms that might be mentioned . Furthermore , the influence of any religious philosophy upon marriage does not mean primarily formulating a set of rules or regulations governing the marital relations . That is one of the end results , rather than a formative factor . The real influence of a religion of whatever kind upon such an institution as marriage is to be found in its attitude toward men and women as human beings . More especially is the attitude toward woman the decisive factor , as the biological handicaps of the female in human society have been exploited mercilessly for the most part by the dominating male . Many of the marital practices prevalent under savage and barbarous social systems have been described in the previous chapters , and others will be considered under their proper classifications in subsequent sections of this book . We are here concerned with the primitive influence upon marriage by the great religions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the great religions took over from their pagan predecessors certain forms and rituals ? which the people understood through ages of practice ? and adapted them to their own ends . It is also true that there is some overlapping of ideas among the great religions themselves , which have had to a great extent a common heritage in Asiatic tradition . Christianity , for instance , is an offshoot of Judaism , as the genealogy and chronology of the Old and New Testaments reveal . Jesus , of Jewish birth and heritage , is the Christian Saviour : Moses is still the major Prophet of Jew and Gentile , // and the Mosaic law dominates the ethical code of Western civilization and its institutions . By the same token , the views of women and marriage held by Hebraic society at the beginning of the Christian era were those that prevailed in the formative years of Christianity . The same telescoping of ideas will be found in many aspects of Hinduism and Buddhism , originating and evolving as they did in India . All the great religions came out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period , took what he liked of Judaism , Christianity , Hinduism and Buddhism , added the result to his own revelations , and gave to the world the creed of Islam ( meaning " resignation " or acceptance of the divine will ) . MARRIAGE AMONG THE ANCIENT HEBREWS The position of woman among the ancient Hebrews was an unenviable one , as it was among most primitive pastoral peoples . However , as our own ethical and religious system evolved from the Hebraic culture , we often overlook this fact , especially as many of the disabilities under which woman has labored through the centuries have been condoned by our Christian civilization . Sumner reminds us that the Jewish idea of marriage was naive and primitive . The purpose was procreation . There seemed to have been little ceremony about marriage , beyond the fact that the suitor induced the father to surrender the daughter in return for gifts . The bride had no choice in the matter whatever , and as this was the custom of her time , she did not expect to be consulted . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual union , as indicated in Genesis xxix , w-s the only principal marriage rite . No priestly function was necessary . The arrangements having been completed , the man took the woman as wife by repeating the formula : " Be thou consecrated to me " , which // was later extended to : " Be thou consecrated to me by the law of Moses and Israel . " In the rabbinical period the betrothal and wedding were united . Afterwards the bride was led or carried to the house of the groom , in a procession , with dancing and rejoicing . Ten guests ( adult males ) must be present in the groom 's house , as witnesses , where prayers were recited and a feast enjoyed . At one period , two bridesmen led the couple to the nuptial chamber where they watched over them until after the conjugal union . The purpose of this was that there might be witnesses to the consummation of the marriage ? which was held all important ? and not merely to the wedding ceremony . When the custom of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later times , a tent was substituted for the chamber . Later a scarf , ceremoniously spread over the heads of the pair , took the place of the tent . The low status of woman in ancient Hebrew society is further evidenced by the fact that the Ten Commandments of the Old Testament are addressed exclusively to man . In the Tenth Commandment the woman is mentioned together with the domestic servants and domestic animals . The man is warned not to covet his neighbor 's wife , nor his man-servant , nor his maid-servant , nor his ox , nor his ass , nor anything that is his neighbor 's . Woman , then , is treated rather as an impersonal object , a piece of property , that man should not covet if in someone else 's possession . The Genesiac admonition , " Be fruitful and multiply , " exercised an immense influence over the ancient Jews . The sexual function is therefore emphasized as the fulfilment of the first divine command to mankind . It is the realization of God 's will for a peopled world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer : // " And so our Creator and Maker ordered us to be fruitful and multiply , and whoever does not engage in reproducing the race is likened unto one who is shedding blood , thus diminishing the essence of the deity , and he is the cause that the holy spirit shall depart from Israel ; his sin is great indeed . " Just as it was sinful to abstain from marriage , so it was unlawful to live childless in the marital estate . One was not permitted to marry a woman too old or too young to bear children . If , after a period of years , the wife bore no children , the husband was obliged to divorce her and marry another who would bring him offspring . The man who destroyed the powers of procreation was twice a murderer . Even he who was born sterile had no place in the religious communal life . A Jew was forbidden to castrate even an animal . But with this preoccupation with sex , the ancient Jews held to the almost universal primitive taboo that stigmatized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and childbirth necessitated purification and penance . There was thus the inescapable paradox ? sex was both right and wrong ; righteous and sinful . The burden of the dilemma could only be made bearable by the most precise laws governing the situation . In Talmudic lore the conduct of the married couple during the woman 's menstruation is elaborately formulated . As the punishment for sexual relations during the menstrual periods is untimely death for both husband and wife , means were devised to guard them from temptations that might lead them to commit this horrible sin . Consequently it was prescribed that the two must not show an affection toward each other during this time . The husband must be careful not to touch his wife , even without any desire . // He must not even hand her anything so small that it may cause their fingers to meet . He may not eat out of the same dishes with her , nor drink from her cup ; but she may eat and drink out of the dishes he has used . He may not sit upon her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not permitted to make his bed in his presence . He must not even see any part of her body that is customarily covered . Leviticus xii dwells on the problem of purification after childbirth in the following manner : " And Jehovah spake unto Moses , saying , Speak unto the children of Israel , saying , If a woman conceive seed , and bear a manchild , then she shall be unclean seven days ; as in the days of the impurity of her sickness ( menstruation ) shall she be unclean . . . . And she shall continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days ; she shall touch no hallowed things , nor come into the sanctuary until the days of her purifying be fulfilled . But if she bear a maidchild , then she shall be unclean two weeks , as in her impurity ; and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying three score and six days . " The low status of woman is here shown , not only by the curse of her uncleanliness in itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great in the birth of a female child as in that of a male child . Manhood and fatherhood are joyfully exempt from these penalized disabilities . Furthermore , the newly married woman was obliged to be able to prove , clothes in hand , that she was a virgin at the moment of her marriage , and if the charge of not being a maiden was sustained , she was subject to stoning to death by the men of her city , as described in Deuteronomy xxii , 13-21 . It may well be said that in citing these extreme instances of discrimination against and hardness toward women , we are going a long way back in the social calendar . This is naturally // true , because our subject in this chapter is Primitive Religious Marital Ideas . The cases cited have been taken from unimpeachable authorities , the holy books of the people in question . Furthermore , the influence of these early teachings remained for centuries to color the thought and ideas of both Jew and Christian in their attitude toward women and marriage . Unfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AMONG THE HINDU CULTS In India , because of the peculiar relation of the household to the social structure , marriage may be said to be almost compulsory ? like conscription in time of war . According to the Hindu lawgivers , anyone making gifts to , or taking gifts from , a Brahman who remains a householder , but does not marry , goes to hell . The unmarried householder is a person to be shunned , and it is sinful to accept hospitality from him . The performance of the duties of a householder is looked upon as a spiritual discipline , for in its true idealistic sense , the household is not primarily a means of insuring the comfort and security of the individual , but is one of self-abnegation , having its manifold obligations to gods and men ? meaning devotion to religion and charity . To the Hindu , expenditure by the householder for the welfare of those in need is not a matter of generosity , but a primary duty in the interests of his own fulfilment . This duty is not only that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their means . Manu says : " The rishis , the forefathers , the gods , the guests , and all living creatures , expect to be maintained by the householder . " Because of these injunctions , it has been said that the Hindu ideal of marriage has no regard for individual preference or inclination ; it is , indeed , rather afraid of them . With the orthodox Hindus , marriage is a religious sacrament // which can not be revoked . A woman convicted of adultery may be deprived of her status and turned out of her caste , but even in this case divorce in the ordinary sense is an impossibility . She can not form a new marital tie , and often remains in the husband 's house on the footing of a slave . Other reasons for marriage than renunciation are recognized , as survivals of earlier and more material concepts , or due to weakness of the human will , but they are frowned upon . Manu classifies these as the Gandharva ( by mutual choice ) , Rakshasa ( by conquest ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking advantage of helplessness ) . It will be seen that in none of these is the social will manifest , but only the desire of the individual . The marriage of mutual choice , or Gandharva , is stigmatized by the ancient sage because it is " born of desire " , and has not as its goal the welfare of society . Accordingly , it is considered best that the bride should be given to a man who has not solicited her . According to the Brahman idea , motherhood , insofar as it is concerned with the physical nurture of offspring , is not essentially different in man and the lower animals , being a function of biological , not of sociological life , governed by instincts which are of Nature , not by man 's own creative power . However , where the mother undergoes voluntary penance for the elevation of the human race , keeping her natural instincts vigorously in subordination to the dictates of mind and soul , there she finds a field for her own creative effort . Kalidasa , the great dramatic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works , looked upon marriage as a state of discipline , not intended for gaining individual happiness . Now , according to the Indian ideal , even the home must be given up in the course of time , in quest of the Infinite . The // household , in fact , is set up only as an important stage in this quest . Even at the present time , it is not uncommon for householders , when their children are grown up , to leave their home and spend their remaining days in some place of pilgrimage . Thus far , we have presented the Hindu ideal of the marriage relation , of the sex factor and of the position of woman as set forth in the Code of Manu . Countless numbers of Hindus have lived up to and carried out this ideal , at least as consistently as the Christians of the Western World have practiced their ethical precepts . However , in its practical aspects the picture of the Hindu marriage system and of the national attitude toward woman , leaves a great deal to be desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasping the situation . In the preceding chapter , we have discussed suttee , the burning or immolation of widows , and of the cruelty visited upon those who were spared this fate after the practice had been prohibited by the British government . In a subsequent chapter some of the evils involved in child marriage will be taken up ? a custom that the religious leaders of the Hindus have tried to perpetuate in the face of strong outside opposition . TEMPLE PROSTITUTION Modern India has much in common with ancient Greece with respect to the position of its women . The wife is carefully isolated from social life , and as a consequence is not an educated , cultured person , but rather a disciplined cog in the household menage . There is a class of courtesans , however , well educated and respected , who furnish intellectual diversion and companionship for those who adhere not too strictly to Manu . It is said to be the custom for the Hindus in the large towns and cities to frequent the society of courtesans for the charm of their wit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached to the temples , but // in our Western lights we probably should not be too hasty in passing judgment upon a time-honored institution which we do not understand . These temple attendants learn to read , sing and dance . Many years ago , J. A. Dubois wrote that in Southern India every temple , according to its size , entertains a band of socalled deva-dasi , that is , " servants or slaves of the gods , " to the number of eight , twelve or more . They perform religious duties , consisting of dancing and singing , twice a day , morning and evening . They are also obliged to assist at all the public ceremonies , which they enliven with their dance and merry song . But as soon as their religious activities are over , " they open their cells of infamy , and frequently convert the temple itself into a stew . " These dancing girls are bred to this profligate life from infancy . They are taken from any caste , and are frequently of respectable birth . It is said not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the belief that it will tend to their happy delivery , making a vow , with the consent of their husbands , to devote the unborn child , if it should be a girl , to the service of Pagoda . In doing so , they imagine they are performing a meritorious duty . Among the Kurubas when there are no sons in the family , the eldest girl is occasionally so dedicated . Among the Voddas , if an adult female remains unmarried , she may be dedicated to a free life in the name of Yellamma , who is their patron deity . The ceremony of dedication frequently resembles that of a formal marriage , and the woman is actually regarded as the wife of the god to whom she is devoted . Thus the dancing girls who serve in the pagodas of Kartikeya , the Hindu God of War , are betrothed and married to him , after which they may prostitute themselves . // THE LEVIRATE The custom demanding that a dead man 's brother must inevitably , under certain circumstances , marry his widow has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Latin levir , brother-in-law ) . Among the Hindus and some others , the obligation arises if the dead man left no children . The levirate often encouraged polygamy , for the duty of marrying a dead brother 's widow may exist even when the living brother is already married . The Bible prescribes the levirate law in Deuteronomy xxv , 5-6 : " If brethren dwell together , and one of them die , and have no son , the wife of the dead shall not be married unto a stranger : her husband 's brother shall go in unto her , and take her to him to wife , and perform the duty of a husband 's brother unto her . And it shall be , that the first-born that she beareth shall succeed in the name of his brother that is dead , that his name be not blotted out of Israel . " A contrary ruling is given in Leviticus , but the custom may have changed after the earlier injunction . The fact that the brother-in-law who failed to marry as directed in Deuteronomy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the law . Furthermore , while the practice ultimately fell into disuse , a symbolic rite relating to it is still practiced among orthodox Jews . In a formal ceremony the widow loosens her brother-in-law 's shoe ( this and his foot must be clean , according to rabbinical law ) , and spits on the ground before him . This symbolism closely adheres to the ritual set forth in Deuteronomy , following the verses quoted , when the living brother fails to marry his widowed sister-inlaw . In India , the principal object of the levirate , with respect to the widowed fiancee , was to furnish the deceased man with a fictitious son , who could perform for him the sacrifices to // the manes , a duty of the highest importance in the religion of Brahma . The law of Manu imposes the levirate even on the brother of a betrothed man who dies , viz. : " When the husband of a young girl happens to die after the betrothal , let the brother of the husband take her for wife . " ( It will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marriage . ) The levirate has been practiced among many peoples besides the Hindus and the Hebrews , among whom may be mentioned the New Caledonians , the Mongols , the Afghans , the Abyssinians and certain of the American Indian tribes . It is believed that an important factor in the prevalence of the custom is the fact that the wife was considered a piece of property , bought and paid for , and was inherited as such by the nearest of kin ? the brother . Among some of the African Negro tribes , the eldest son inherits and marries all his father 's wives with the exception of his own mother . PRIMITIVE CHRISTIAN VIEW OF MARRIAGE Christianity introduced a concept of marriage ? taken over from the Hebrews ? which differed greatly from that generally held by the principal contemporaneous peoples of culture , the Greeks and Romans . St. Paul , who did more than any other of the founders of Christianity to mold the traditional Western attitude with respect to woman and marriage , considered celibacy preferable to the married state . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nevertheless , to avoid fornication , let each man have his own wife , and let each woman have her own husband " ( I Corinthians , vii , 1-2 ) . If the unmarried and widows can not contain , let them marry , " for it is better to marry than // to burn . " He was true to his own views and refrained from marriage . Marriage , according to the doctrine of Paul , is therefore at best a compromise between indulgence and renunciation of sexual passion . Celibacy was proclaimed as the Christian ideal because the unmarried , being free from domestic obligations , can care for the things of the Lord . The early fathers of the Church , Tertullian and Jerome ( in anticipation of the end of the world ) considered virginity an end in itself . They thought it pious and noble to renounce the function on which procreation depends ; first , because matters of the spirit were infinitely more important ; secondly , because in view of the imminence of the approaching end of the world , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propagating the race . Commenting on the utterances of the Apostle Paul , Tertullian emphasizes that the better of two alternatives is not necessarily good . It is better to lose one eye than two , but neither is good . So , also , though it is better to marry than to burn , it is far better neither to marry nor to burn . Marriage " consists of that which is the essence of fornication , " whereas continence " is a means whereby a man will traffic in a mighty substance of sanctity . " Gregory of Nyssa and John of Damascus lamented that if Adam had preserved his obedience to the Creator he would have lived forever in a state of virgin purity , and some harmless mode of vegetation would have peopled paradise with a race of innocent and immortal beings . Eusebius and Hieronymus agreed that the teaching of the Old Testament , " Be fruitful and multiply , " was no longer suited to the times , and did not concern Christians . Origen 138 declared : " Matrimony is impure and unholy ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he emasculated himself . Toward the end of the fourth century , a Council of the Church excommunicated the monk Jovinian because he denied that virginity was more meritorious than marriage . In brief , during the first centuries of Christianity marriage was tolerated only as a necessary expedient for the continuance of the human race , and as a restraint , however imperfect , on what was considered the natural licentiousness of man . Many of the early Christians , especially the Montanists and Novatians , strongly disapproved of second marriages by persons of either sex . Such a marriage was described as a " kind of fornication , " or as " specious adultery . " There was also involved in this premise the belief that when husband and wife were united in the hereafter , the presence of an extra spouse would prove an embarrassing or unchristian-like triangle . These doctrines , of course , were not characteristic of Christianity only , but were largely a social heritage directly from Judaism and Greek philosophy , and , indirectly , from the more ancient civilizations of Babylon , Egypt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in low esteem . In the laws of Manu , for instance , we find the warning : " The cause of dishonor is woman ; the cause of hostility is woman ; the cause of worldly things is woman ; therefore woman should be shunned . " Besides the belief in the degradation of woman , the fear of woman is repeatedly naively implied . These are the same thoughts , if not in the same words , as expressed by the Christian fathers . Christianity 's early contribution toward this concept of woman and marriage was therefore not a new one , but rather a fresh and vigorous re-emphasis of the subject by a new and zealous organization imbued with the missionary spirit . Medieval Domestic Relations Court In medieval times , sometimes a man and his wife settled a serious marital argument by fighting a duel before a court . The man was made to stand in a hole while his wife was permitted to stand free above him . Each held a stout club . Whoever won the fight was pronounced legally justified by the judge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no small part of the success of the prophet Moham-med in gaining converts to his new religious doctrine in the early part of the seventh century AD. was due to the emphasis placed on sensual joys , in contrast to the early Christian asceticism . Mohammedanism is a man 's religion ; sex is an integral part of it ? not only in this world , but even more so in the next , where sensual delights without limit and without end are promised to the faithful . The position of women in the creed of Islam is decidedly one of subjection . They are excluded from participation in the religious rites in the mosque ; they must carry out their liturgical exercises in the privacy of their homes . They are to remain hidden from the strangers ' eyes , but must remain ever accessible to the husband , their master . Mohammed exhorted his followers to give full and free ex-pression to the sexual impulse : " Your wives are your tillage ; go in therefore unto your tillage in what manner soever ye will . " Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is lawful for you on the night of the fast to go to your wives ; they are a garment unto you and you are a garment unto them . " In short , the function of woman was to satisfy the Moslem 's passion and to raise his children . Polygamy is allowed , but not without restriction . Four wives is the legal limit for a Moslem , although he may cohabit with any number of concubine slaves . The Prophet , however , was allowed as many wives as he wished . As polygamy is recognized as the cause of much marital strife and unhappiness in Mohammedan countries , as well as elsewhere , monogamy is the rule of the great majority of Moslems. // A Moslem may marry a Christian woman or a Jewess , but a Mohammedan woman is not under any circumstances permitted to marry an unbeliever . In all cases , however , the child born of a Moslem , whatever the mother 's faith , is required to be raised as a Mohammedan . Incestuous marriages , in contrast with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to a woman who is related to the faithful " by milk in the degrees which would preclude his marriage with her if she were similarly related to him by blood . " This proscription refers to in-law connections ; that is , a marriage to a mother-in-law , or a step-mother , a step-daughter , a son 's widow , a brother 's widow , etc . Marrying two sisters at the same time is also forbidden , as is marriage with two women who stand to each other in the relation of aunt and niece ; or with unemancipated slaves , if he already has a free wife . The Moslem rite has less formality than that of Christianity or any other of the great religions . It does correspond somewhat , however , with the simple marriage rite of the early Christians , before the Council of Trent . A simple declaration of a man and woman who have arrived at the age of puberty , before two witnesses , of their intention to marry each other , and the payment of part of the dowry ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten dirhems ( about one dollar ) ? is sufficient for a legal marriage . A girl under age is given away by her natural or appointed guardian , with or without her consent . It is strictly forbidden to the believer to see the face of any woman who is neither his wife nor his concubine , nor belongs to any of the forbidden degrees . As was the case with all early religions , Mohammedanism // considered woman unclean . If a man touched a woman , he was required to purify himself before going to pray . The mere act of touching a woman was looked upon as something of an offensive nature . " 0 true believers , when you prepare yourself to pray . . . if you have touched a woman , and yet find no water , take fine clean sand and rub your faces and hands therewith . " This attitude toward woman ? part of the great universal taboo among all peoples in the pre-scientific age ? was predicated upon the biological fact of menstruation and the universal belief in evil spirits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the Mohammedans have a fear that malignant spirits may enter the woman during the sexual relations . In Morocco it is always considered necessary for the husband before having intercourse with his wife to say " bismillah " ? a supplication meaning " in the name of Allah " , lest the devil should enter the woman and make the child a villain . This belief has the support of Mohammedan tradition . In pointing out many of the crude beliefs and primitive ideas inherent in Mohammedanism , it would be grossly unfair not to make at least passing reference to an intellectual and cultural side of its history which is often overlooked . During several centuries of the Christian era , especially that bleak period commonly referred to as the " Dark Ages " , the educated Moslems did much to keep both the spirit and letter of civilization from perishing from the earth . From the ninth to the thirteenth centuries , they were admittedly the teachers of barbarous Europe . The real renaissance of Greek culture took place under the patronage of the Abbasides , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been lost irreCOURTSHIP // trievably had it not been for the home it had found in the schools of Islam . Arabic philosophy , medicine , natural history , geography , history , mathematics , grammar and rhetoric flourished and left many invaluable legacies to the culture and knowledge of the Western World when it finally took them up . MEANING OF THE SEX TABOO Taboo , meaning " forbidden " , is a word adopted from the Polynesian ( tabu ) . The practice of taboo is found under various names all over the world , but nowhere has it been so systematized as in Polynesia . It is an important ? an almost all-important ? factor in the lives of all known savage and barbarian tribes . It is an integral part of all primitive religions . It was almost equally momentous in the lives and religious observances of the ancient Hebrews , the Hindus , the early Christians and the Mohammedans . Taboo is something forbidden because the tabooed object is regarded as potent to injure , owing to its mana , or mysteri-ous ( spiritual ) power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's or king 's possessions , or evil and unclean . The fear of malig-nant spirits is the basis of taboo ; so we can readily see how extensive and universal has been this fear . Fear of the unknown , fear of the unseen , fear of strange phenomena , all are bound up with taboos . Certain persons ( priests and members of the ruling family ) , certain animals ( the tribe 's totem ) , and certain objects , are held to be imbued to an unusual degree with this mana , and hence are regarded as holy . They are held in awe , and ordinary man must not have personal contact with them . Taboos are held on other things because it is considered that 144 145 they bode ill . The list of such tabooed persons and objects is almost limitless , taking into consideration the vagaries of different peoples , but the taboos on injurious or destructive influences seem principally concerned with such things as a dead body , a new-born child , blood ? particularly a woman 's blood , and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its association with the loss of virginity and the phenomenon of childbirth ; the sick , outcasts , sometimes foreigners , criminals ( the primitive idea of crime often being much different from ours ) , animals , even words and names , and many other things at one time or another . Taboos may be permanent or temporary , private or public . A river is tabooed by a king until the fishing season is over ; a forest until the game is caught , a field until the crop is harvested . A public taboo is where a whole community is made taboo while gathering the crop . This renders it impossible for any member of the tribe to do anything else until the taboo is removed and prevents any stranger from approaching the tabooed ground . The removal of the public taboo is made by a priest , who repeats a spell and performs certain rites over the tabooed people . What is not taboo is noa ( common ) . There may be a taboo on knots , locks , crossed arms and legs ? in brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most rigorous taboos , however , are concerned with sex , which is not to be wondered at , considering its vast importance both in individual and social life . The sex taboo is essentially a set of inhibitions which control and restrain the intercourse of the sexes with each other in ordinary life . TABOO ON WOMEN The belief that a woman 's blood is fatal to a man leads at stated periods to a temporary taboo of women , even among civilized Hindus . For the same reason in // many countries men may not eat with women . At menstruation women are forbidden to touch men 's food or utensils . It is only by an understanding of the mana principle , with the belief in sympathetic magic that is bound up in the concept , that we can obtain an insight into the almost universal custom of the woman shunned under certain conditions , and the sex taboo among primitive peoples . The transmission of mana through contact is inherent in the notion of sympathetic magic , which is the belief that the qualities of one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The avoidance of the menstruating woman , so widespread throughout the primitive world , was undoubtedly due to the belief that this function was a demonic possession . A woman during this period was held to be unclean and possessed by a demon . Primordial man could not be expected to know that the phenomenon of menstruation was in any way associated with reproduction . When the association was ultimately discovered , the taboos had become a fixed practice in social life , and such established customs are not dropped merely because the reason for their origin has become known . Furthermore , by this time the reason for their origin had long since been forgotten , so the practice remained valid for the all-sufficient reason that it was a custom . Among the Maoris , if a man ate food cooked by a menstruous woman , he would be " tabu an inch thick . " An Australian native who discovered that his wife had lain on his blanket at her menstrual period , killed her for violating the taboo and died of terror himself within a fortnight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dares to touch anything that the men use , or even to walk on a path that is frequented by men . The primitive man 's fear of women at the time of her sexual // crises ? menstruation , pregnancy and childbirth ? is really but an intensification of his attitude toward her at all times . If she is possessed by demons on these occasions , how can he be sure that she is entirely free of evil influences at any other time ? Notwithstanding all the precautions that are taken to purify her and drive out the malignant spirits , he is not entirely reassured , so woman remains suspect . No small part of the elements involved in the belief in witchcraft and in the horrors of witch-burning in civilized countries of the Western World as recently as within the past two or three centuries was due to this latent feeling . TABOO OF CHILDBED Restrictions are imposed on women in childbed apparently for similar reasons . At such periods women are considered to be in a dangerous condition , and may infect any person or thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes kept in quarantine until , with the recovery of their health and strength , it is evident that the danger has passed away . In Tahiti it was customary to seclude a woman after childbirth for two or three weeks in a temporary hut erected on sacred ground . During the period of her seclusion she was forbidden to touch food and had to be fed by another woman assigned for that purpose . If anyone else touched the child at this period , thus exposing himself to the curse , he was subjected to the same restrictions as the mother until the purification rites had been performed . Likewise , among the Alaskan Kadiaks , when a woman is about to be delivered , she retires to a low hovel built of reeds , regardless of the season , and is considered so unclean that no one will touch her , and she is fed with food at the end of a stick . // EVIL OMEN OF THE STILLBORN Some primitives regard the danger as still worse , and the pollution more deadly , if the woman has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . In such case she may not go near any living being . The slightest contact with her or with anything she has used is extremely dangerous . She receives her food at the end of a long rod . After three weeks , she may return to her home , sub-ject only to the restrictions of an ordinary confinement . The evils inherent in a concealed miscarriage are still more terrible . In this case not only the husband and family are in jeopardy , but the whole country ; even the sky may become troubled . To quote a medicine man of the Ba-Pedi tribe : " When a woman has had a miscarriage , when she has allowed her blood to flow , and has hidden the child , it is enough to cause the burning winds to blow and to parch the country with heat . The rain no longer falls , for the country is no longer in order . When the rain approaches the place where the blood is , it will not dare come further . It will fear and remain at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She has spoiled the country of the chief , for she has hidden her blood which had not yet been well congealed to fashion a man . That blood is taboo . " In a case of this kind they go and arrest the woman . They compel her to show where she has hidden the result of her unsuccessful attempt at childbirth . They dig at the spot , then sprinkle the hole with a decoction of two sorts of roots pre-pared in a special pot . A little of the earth is taken from the grave and thrown into the river . Water is then brought back from the river and sprinkled where she shed her blood . She herself must wash every day with the medicine . Then the country will be moistened again by rain . The country is purified ! // THE TABOO OF INCEST The widespread feeling of revulsion toward incest , or sexual congress with very close blood relatives , has been the subject of exhaustive commentary . That it is anti-social is generally conceded , and therefore immoral , because too close inbreeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some notable exceptions to this rule , but they may be explained by the fact that the parents in question , as individuals , were quite exceptionally gifted , and therefore passed on these gifts or desirable characteristics to their children . Such fortunate background , however , can not be assured when inbreeding takes place at random and on a more considerable scale , so the practice is justly considered detrimental to the race . Even the primitive savages appear to have discovered this . Some authorities find evidence of a close connection between sexual modesty and the aversion to incest , or , perhaps , more strictly a sexual aversion which prevails among members of the same small domestic circle . Bentham stated as a psychological fact that individuals accustomed to see each other and to know each other from an age which is neither capable of conceiving desire nor of inspiring it , will see each other with the same eyes to the end of life . In primitive society the incest prohibition applies primarily to relations between brothers and sisters , or more especially between brothers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp distinction drawn between elder and younger sisters . The two belong to different classes of kinship , and the relation bears a different name . In most tribes the elder sister stands much in the same position as the mother . The Nayars of the Malabar coast , for instance , have an ex150 STRANGE CUSTOMS OF traordinary respect for their mother . The primitive attitude to-ward the mother is probably not so much that of affection , as we know it , as it is of awe toward one whose magical properties were responsible for the existence of the son . The mother was held in esteem if for no other reason than to propitiate the good mana with which she was imbued , and to keep in her good graces . The curse of a mother was the most terrible imprecation that could descend upon the human head . The primitives regarded it as the only curse the effects of which could never be avoided . As they honored their mothers , in like manner these savages regarded their elder sisters . But with the younger sisters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they observe toward them the utmost reserve . They say that dangerous situations might else arise , the younger sisters being thoughtless . Their respect for their elder sisters , being of a maternal sort , pre-cludes any thought of sexual intimacy , and therefore it is un-necessary to guard against it . In Tonga the elder sisters are likewise treated with remark-able deference . A chief will show his respect by not even dar-ing to enter the house of his elder sisters . Among the natives of central Australia , a man may not speak to his younger sisters , but there is no restriction as to his speaking to his elder sisters . These views represent the attitude of many primitive societies . Marriage between mother and son has been particularly abhorrent to almost all primitive tribes . The exceptions to this rule are so slight as to be negligible . Unions between father and daughter , however , are much more prevalent , but tend to come under the tribal ban with a higher . degree of civilization . The mother-in-law taboo is very widespread , and usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not touch or // speak to his mother-in-law , nor the latter have any contact with her son-in-law . They are forbidden to pronounce each other 's names . This prohibition with respect to names is a common feature of all taboos between persons . To mention a name is a form of contact ; it calls forth the spirit of the other person , and is to be avoided . The basis of this taboo is unquestionably the prevention of incest with a new kinswoman . Other reasons have been ascribed for the prohibition put upon all social contact between the principals of this relationship . It has been called a natural sequence of marriage by capture through which the people had passed . Thus , when the capture was a reality , the indignation of the girl 's mother would be real , and the groom would shy away from one whom he had so cruelly offended by stealing her daughter . With the passing of marriage by capture , the maternal anger and the groom 's embarrassment became symbolized . These symbols continued long after the origin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exogamy ? the law prohibiting marriage between persons of the same blood as a prevention of incest ? has had wide application in primitive society . Among the natives of New Britain it was believed that marriage within the totem ( tribe ) would result in the death of the woman . If this taboo were violated her parents or relatives usually killed her for shame , so that the belief became a reality . The groom 's life was likewise in jeopardy , unless he fled . The exogamous principle works as an obstacle to matrimony in many instances where there are natural difficulties to its fulfilment . It has been found , for example , that unmarried men are more frequently met with among the Tungus than among the Chukchee , not only on account of the considerable price to be paid for the bride , but more so because marriages are // strictly exogamous , and a bride may be taken only from another clan than that of the bridegroom , which added to the difficulties of marrying . The same observation has been made with reference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatives are prohibited , and the chance to marry at all is considerably diminished . As a result , with the decreased population , a man very often could not find a wife , even though in the midst of numerous women . Marriages between cousins are disapproved by the Eskimos , and also by the Mahlemuts and the Chippewas , as well as many other American Indian tribes . The Algonquins put to death those who violated this rule . The Greenlanders do not marry near relatives , even to the third degree . They consider such unions unnatural and contrary to the wishes of the gods . In Polynesia marriage with blood relatives is taboo and rarely occurs . The natives of Andaman do not permit marriage with those even distantly related . The Dyaks are specific in prohibiting a man from marrying a cousin , aunt or niece . Marriages in Samoa are carefully guarded against incest . ENDOGAMY Correlative with exogamy is endogamy , which enforces marriage within a social or political group . These two principles are not necessarily contradictory , as they may refer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and often do occur side by side with each other among the same people . It has been well stated that there is everywhere an outer circle out of which marriage is definitely prohibited or considered improper , and an inner circle within which no marriage is allowed . Both the terms endogamy and exogamy were coined by J. F. McLennan , the Scottish sociologist and anthropologist . We have only to look about us to find this principle in operaCOURTSHIP // tion . For instance , in our present-day society it is not customary to marry outside our race ( referring to color ) . It is true this is sometimes done , but the penalty is heavy in social disapproval and ostracism , when , indeed , the law itself is not violated by so doing , as would be the case in many states . This is an example of endogamy . On the other hand , it is not customary for marriage to take place between very close blood relatives , such as brother marrying sister , niece marrying uncle , nephew marrying aunt , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set against this practice , but it is repugnant to all normal individuals . Here we have an example of exogamy . In primitive society where social life is not stabilized by education , formal training and ethical precepts , as we know these influences , where the individuals are thrown together more promiscuously , and cohabitation is apt to take place from the time of puberty ? when the mind is still immature and undiscriminating ? experience has taught the necessity of formulating stringent taboos to control the primary impulses . These taboos , as we have seen , are associated with sacred rites and backed by the belief in sympathetic magic which is inherent in primitive psychology . While civilized man has quite rational ideas regarding the prevention of inbreeding , and generally has an abhorrence of incest , the primitive concept of the whole subject is often more vague and involved . For instance , very distant cousins and even persons whose blood ties are imaginary ? kinfolk by virtue of some tribal rite ? may be forbidden to marry under the exogamous principle . Endogamy is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hindus . Their religion forbids the intermarriage of persons belonging to different castes . Not only must a Hindu 155 refrain from marrying outside the limits of his caste , but where , as is usually the case , the caste is divided into sub-castes , he must not ordinarily marry outside his sub-caste . In some instances he may marry in certain sub-castes but not in others . The tendency in civilized society against mating members of different social strata is an analogous example of class endogamy , which has had wide application in both the ancient and modern world . In Rome patricians and plebeians were not permitted to intermarry until the year 445 B.C. In most countries in medieval times a freeman could not contract a lawful marriage with a serf . When nobility finally emerged from the class of freemen as a distinct order , marriages between persons of noble birth and persons who , although free , were not noble were considered misalliances . No one holds that endogamy represents a stage in the evolution of marriage through which all tribes once passed , and strictly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exogamy . It should be noted that endogamous rule applies only to what might be called legal marriage , and does not usually exclude concubinage . Pride in blood is not always the motivating principle of endogamy ; it may represent the desire to keep certain highly prized traditions the exclusive property of a clan or community . There are dangers in inbreeding which the primitive mind seems to have perceived in giving direction to the exogamous principle . Inbreeding preserves a type , but weakens the stock . Outbreeding strengthens the stock , but enfeebles the type . The taboo having been established very early in primitive society , the holy men and chiefs , who generally were the supervisors of the procedure , soon came to realize how great was the power that came to them through the associated superstitions. // As the hereditary beneficiaries therefore , they did their utmost to carry on the traditions and to prevent any outside influence from weakening them . One of the advantages seen in endogamy by these hereditary beneficiaries was that it tended to conserve the tribal traditions . As human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and resists change , it was not difficult to perpetuate practices , once they became established , that worked to the interests of the privileged class . FOOD TABOOS Malevolent spirits being omnipresent , according to primitive notions , it was believed that evil could enter the body with the food . Undoubtedly the occurrence of stomach ache and other alimentary disorders confirmed this impression . Therefore , very stringent taboos were practiced applying to food and drink , and their consumption . Furthermore , at the time of eating the soul might escape through the mouth , or be extracted by the magic arts of an enemy present . There was a belief among some savages that the indwelling spirit leaves the body and returns to it through the mouth . Hence there was a double jeopardy ; first , that the individual 's spirit may leave the mouth and venture too far to return safely ; secondly , - that in the absence of one 's own spirit , a homeless or evil spirit may enter the mouth and take its place . Precautions were therefore adopted to guard against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to prevent the soul from straying when one is in the house . At feasts the whole house may be shut up so that the soul may stay and enjoy the good things set on the festal board . The members of a Madagascar tribe bar their doors when they eat , and will not knowingly permit anyone to see them eating or drinking . They are doubly particular that a person // of the opposite sex shall not see them doing so . A traveler had to bribe a native to see him drink ; but not even a bribe was sufficient inducement for the man to let a woman see him drink , so powerful was the influence of this taboo . The primitive was therefore exceedingly careful with whom he ate or drank , and once having made his decision to do so with a stranger , after having made the proper magic signs as a protection , the partaking of food together was a pledge of friendship , or even a symbol of newly formed kinship . The Atiu Islanders , to this day , refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not eat food that has been touched by a white man . Among certain Eskimo tribes , the woman is forbidden to eat with her husband . In many African tribes it is a capital offense to eat with a woman . The belief is that the man who eats with a woman runs the risk of sudden and mysterious death . It is therefore strictly taboo . In view of these ordinary precautions taken by the common people , it will readily be understood that the precautions taken by the king and priests are extraordinary . If any man or beast saw the King of Loango eat , that man or beast was instantly put to death . A favorite dog , having run into the room when the king was dining , was ordered to be killed on the spot . It is said that the king 's own son , a boy of twelve , once inadvertently saw his father drink . Immediately the king ordered his own son 's death . It is believed that great evil ? even death ? shall come to the king if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one unfortunate enough to witness this act is sacrificed to save the monarch . Taboos such as this , and there are many others that set the king apart from all his subjects , result in traditions that enhance the royal prerogative . One can not envy the monarch these dubious privileges , but it is part of a system of which he is a hereditary victim , and he would be the last , seemingly , to want a change . This has been the attitude generally of all victims , high or low , of superstitions and shackling traditions throughout the ages . TABOO OF WIDOW MARRIAGE Even in the modern world , according to convention , it is not general for widows to remarry until after the lapse of a certain period , which used to be known as the widow 's " mourning year . " In most primitive societies this custom amounts to a set prohibition for periods ranging from a few months to several years , or even permanently . In the savage mind , the widow is a bearer of ill-luck , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tribe against death infection , of which her late husband was a victim . In addition to the prescribed lapse of time that must ensue between the decease of her husband and the widow 's remarriage , certain purificatory rites are performed to dissipate the corpse lien or taint that is upon her . Until this result is satisfactorily accomplished marriage would be a great risk alike for the widow and for the second husband . All sorts of misfortune may befall the man who consorts with an unpurified widow . The foolhardy man is doomed to be drowned , to die in battle or to fail in whatever he undertakes . There is also the prospect of the deceased husband 's ghost bullying her into lasting widowhood , unless by the performance of suitable rites the intimidating spirit can permanently be banished . Jealous ghosts are said to be particularly the bane of Hindu widow-brides . A widow married by the more ceremonial of the two Creek forms of marriage was considered an adulteress if she spoke or made free with any man within four years of her bereavement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
