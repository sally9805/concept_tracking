txt An open split occurred in the Itallian Government today when Bruno Fornaciari . Minister of the Interior , resigned in protest against the " continued administration of civilian matters by the military . " A usually reliable source from Italy said that his step might have been prompted by the certainty that , as things now stood , he could not accept responsibility for the maintenance of internal order unless he had wider powers without military supervision . When Premier Pietro Badoglio categorically ( refused to entertain such a suggestion ; the Minister withdrew , taking with him a large measure of public support from the Catholic Popular party . on whose principles he acts . Signor Fornaciari was dismissed by the Premier , according to a Rome broadcast , The United Press reported from London . The broadcast added that he had been replaced by Senator Umberto Ricci , former general director of civil administration . Simultaneously , the Prefect of Naples announced his resignation , for almost exactly the same reasons . In a declaration to a Roman ' newspaper cited by tonight 's Giustizia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " protested " the mishandling , by those entrusted with their execution , of measures of rescue // ITALIAN MINISTER !

" While the Minister of Propaganda , in broadcasts and through the heavily controlled press , was attempting to wipe out any unfavorable impression that might have been created by those two developments , a note of cautious watchfulness was struck by another Badoglio appointee in the industrial North , Giovanni hoveda . He " admitted the honor conferred on him " but insisted that he would have to get more information than he already possessed before he would accept it . Signor Rovedo has been appointed a Vice Commissioner of the Confederation of Industrial Workers for the north . In a statement to the Corriere della Sera today , he announced his intention of " proceeding to Rome immediately for conference with government officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's syndicalist policy , as well as its intentions on foreign matters , before I can accept this post . " His hesitation , according to reports from Milan , did more to undo the effects of yesterday 's split in the left-wing coalition than all the denunciations of the Giustizia e Liberty movement or the blandishments of the " liberal Socialists . " For , in a solid bloc , workers of all the left wing parties demonstrated quietly for peace today at the funerals for victims of the latest Royal Air Force raids . There were none of the accusations of " traitor " or " anarchist " that led to yesterday 's free-for-all fights in various war factories in the Milan area . Conservative observers returning from Milan throughout the day reported , instead , that the general atmosphere indicated a growing certainty among the working classes that their leaders were preparing to " take other coordinated measures " unless the government acted quickly . However , there were increased indications that the government would now implement measures agreed upon at the Verona conference , which broke up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German officers and men have resumed handling Milan 's air-raid defenses , while train movements from the north have begun bringing in supplies and reinforcements . The conferences of the German Foreign Minister , Joachim von Ribbentrop , with the Italian Government are expected to result in the " reactivization " of German-Italian relations . In support of such conclusions neutral diplomats in Berlin point out that Italy is still fighting on the side of her Axis partner and that Germany 's military authorities had scored valuable gains in time that enabled them to anticipate the immediate future with greater ease than was expected when Benito Mussolini disappeared from the picture . The German Foreign Office is not talking but neutral commentators believe that the situation today is where it was when Premier Badoglio announced that " the war goes on . " While it is not believed that Italy has assumed new commitments toward Germany , the state of relations following Herr von Ribbentrop 's visit is now believed to be in the nature of community of interests  --  all in Germany 's favor in that it affords the Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period when Italy completely disappears from the military picture .
