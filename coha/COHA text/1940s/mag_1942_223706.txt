It would be better for a united America to lose this war than for America to remain disunited ; for a united America would rise from defeat , but if a part of t is won and a part of us lost , we would remain divided forever . <P> So said Mauricio Nabuco , Secretary-general of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry , at last January 's Rio conference . Last week Pan-American unity got its biggest tangible boost in World War II when Brazil became the first South American country formally to declare war on Germany and Italy. * ( Japan having committed no aggression against Brazil , was omitted from the declaration . ) <P> In a few short days prior to the declaration , submarines had sunk six Brazilian ships , bringing Brazil'stotal of Axis-sunk ships to 19 . Lost with the ships were 169 Brazilian officers and soldiers and more than 600 civilians . As the news reached Rio , crowds swarmed into the Avenida Rio Branco , smashed windows of Axis stores , burned Nazi flags , clamored for war . <P> Appearing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring , Brazil 's President Getulio Vargas promised : " Brazil will defend her waters , will man her coasts . " He tried to quiet the people with announcements that U.S. and Brazilian flyers had sunk seven Axis submarines , that German diplomats had been seized as hostages for Brazilians held by the Nazis , that Axis nationals in Brazil had been warned they might be shipped off to labor camps . <P> The People Growled . Obviously Getulio Vargas had qualms about departing from his policy of militant defense . And he may have had good reasons : Axis submarines might have concentrated on Brazilian ships intentionally to provoke war and thus to draw bigger U.S. forces into the South Atlantic ; Axis strategists might be trying to cut communications between Brazil 's vulnerable hump and the south , preparatory to an attack from Dakar . <P> But , though Vargas made them stop parading , Brazilians , traditionally jealous of European encroachments , growled for war behind closed doors . Echoes of their growls reached Vargas , who hesitated no longer . Summoning his Cabinet , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In view of acts of war against our sovereignty , a state of belligerence is recognized between Brazil and the aggressor nations , Germany and Italy . " <P> Already the radio had spread the news to the Brazilian people and they chattered in sidewalk cafes , discussing who among them might volunteer , sizing up the part South America 's biggest nation might play in World War II . <P> Bigger in area than the U.S. , Brazil has a population of more than 40,000,000 , of whom 1,000,000 are of pure German stock and 2,000,000 of Italian . Its small conscript army , recently expanded with U.S. technical assistance , numbers little more than 100,000 men , with an estimated 300,000 in reserve-just about large enough to squash possible fifth columns . Armed with World War I French artillery , the army ordered more from Germany in 1938 , received cannon but little ammunition . Under Lend-Lease it has received additional arms from the U.S. , but is still pitifully equipped to resist Blitzkrieg . <P> Brazil 's Air Force , many of whose pilots are U.S.-trained , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But poor communications have recently made Brazil feverishly air-minded , and with U.S. assistance it has built some 600 new landing fields .
