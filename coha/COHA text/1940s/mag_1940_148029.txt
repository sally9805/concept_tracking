When war started four months ago it caused a good many price fluctuations in the U. S. Few were so extreme as the retail price of sugar , which between Aug. 31 and Sept. 10 rose from 5 to as much as 10 in some stores . Result : Franklin Roosevelt made an example of sugar , removed the quotas controlling production and importation , effectively reduced the sugar price to about its pre-war level . Last week , the emergency passed and the ghost of 1915-20 's sugar shortage laid , Franklin Roosevelt proclaimed new sugar quotas-a trifle smaller than 1939's-for the year 1940.
