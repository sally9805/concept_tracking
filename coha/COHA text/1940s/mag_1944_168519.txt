The home State of durable ex-Senator Jim Watson gave the Senate another notable orator last week-this time a Democrat : balding , 48-year-old Samuel Dillon Jackson , ex-State Attorney General of Indiana , ex-prosecuting attorney , longtime elder in Fort Wayne 's Presbyterian Church , active member of the Scottish Rite . Governor Henry F. Schricker appointed him to fill the unexpired term of the late Frederick Van Nuys ( see p. 82 ) . * Said Senator Jackson : " I will support the President . " <P> Governor Schricker had taken a terrible amount of advice . The phones had been ringing for four days . Three calls were already awaiting him when he reached his office the morning after Senator Van Nuys 's death . Shortly the telegrams started coming . The man for the post was the Supreme Governor of the Loyal Order of Moose . The man for the post was the State Democratic Chairman . The woman for the post was a fine local lady with eight children . Labor plugged the State Democratic Chairman . Then A.F. of L. and C.I.O. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex-Congressmen called to offer themselves . The Governor dragged lapel-hangers along when he walked abroad . Strangers breathed down his neck as he lunched . The phone calls came from all over the country . Telegrams came from both coasts . The Governor 's secretary counted the telegrams the third night : 275 . On the final night , with good Senator Van Nuys scarcely in his grave , the Governor estimated them at 1,000 . <P> * Till Nov. 7 , when a candidate will be elected for the term 's remaining two months .
