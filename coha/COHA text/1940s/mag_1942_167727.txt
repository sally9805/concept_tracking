Though his mother back in New Jersey had worn black for a month , Michael Wajda , ship 's electrician , was not dead . While the raft under him drifted in the doldrums , he clung to life , alternately raved , mumbled and lay insensate under the equatorial sun . Last week came word that after 46 days on the flotsam-cradling sea he had been picked up near Georgetown , British Guiana , was recovering in a hospital there . <P> A torpedo had blasted Wajda 's ship , a U.S. merchantman , at night ; shellfire pummeled her carcass . Shell fragments got Wajda in the head and ankle , rolled him overboard like a sack . He came to on a pitching raft where ship 's Engineers Mahlon Benton and Lindgren Bancroft had dragged him . They rigged a sail of two big yellow quarantine flags , dressed Wajda 's wounds , doled him out a supply of chocolate and hardtack . <P> As the days dragged by , monotonous and deadly , rain came and brought drinking water-and raised mold on the hardtack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men trolled with it , caught fish , which they ate raw . The fish guts they threw into the water lured hungry sharks which , Wajda said , " slapped the raft with their tails and we were afraid it would overturn . " Benton began to grow weak . " On the 24th day he died and we put him overboard , mumbling what prayers we could remember . . . . Then Bancroft started to go out of his mind . ... He tried to jump . . . . I grabbed him . . . and we rolled around . . . . The raft lurched and he went over . I was too weak to try to save him . " <P> Wajda was alone on the raft . Once he sighted a distant ship , dully watched it merge again with the sea . At last , on the 45th day , the water showed streaks of mud that mean only one thing in shipwreck language : land-and help . And help soon came . Said Wajda : " I almost fainted for joy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
