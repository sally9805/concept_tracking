Not long after V-J Day , when the paper shortage had eased up a bit for the first time in four years , we were able to put a lot more copies of TIME on U.S. newsstands . A phenomenon , which had been gathering momentum for some time , then suddenly became apparent : the demand for TIME on the newsstands had grown to four times what it was before the war . Then , it was 120,000a week . Now , sales have reached half a million and TIME is still selling out . <P> Quite naturally , this startling increase made us want to find out why so many more of you were buying newsstand copies of TIME and , if possible , who you were . War 's end and redeployment , of course , had brought a great many readers of our overseas editions home from the battlefronts , and so we thought that perhaps returned veterans were largely responsible for the increase . We decided to research the question . Louisville , Ky. was chosen as the test city , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us there , assigning interviewers to question TIME buyers at newsstands all over town . <P> When the returns were in , we found that we were only partly right about the newly returned veterans . Three in ten of our Louisville newsstand TIME buyers were veterans , all right , but seven in ten were Louisville civilians . In other words , three times as many home-fronters had taken to buying TIME on the newsstands as before the war . <P> <P> But the presence of so many veterans among these civilian newsstand buyers made the <P> entire Louisville group average slightly younger than TIME subscribers , with smaller incomes ( armed forces pay ) and more education ( younger people these days are more educated than older people ) . Most ( 68% ) of the group of civilians and veterans were males in the salaried minor executive class , and a majority ( 69% ) were married . Interestingly enough , more than a third were former TIME subscribers . They gave two main reasons for choosing to buy their copies of TIME at a newsstand : 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not at present permanently located . <P> <P> Our own returned servicemen here at TIME were not surprised at how many veterans were buying TIME on the newsstands . Having read TIME-and seen their friends queue up for copies - on all sorts of warfronts during the last four years , they had predicted that quite a percentage of our postwar newsstand buyers would prove to be servicemen who had got the habit of reading TIME abroad . <P> We were particularly interested in these newsstand buyers from the services because this was our first good chance to find out just what kind of men read TIME 'S overseas editions . For many years this part of TIME 'S circulation had not been measurable because the armed forces would not permit civilian questionnaires . Now , we have the following picture of these Louisville veteran readers : <P> The majority ( 53.2% ) are in their thirties , are married ( 63.8% ) , are in the professional-executive class , and have been to college ( 57.5% ) . They have about the same TIME newsstand-buying habits as Louisville civilians : two-thirds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
