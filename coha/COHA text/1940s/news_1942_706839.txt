txt Faced with increasing difficulties in maintaining petroleum supplies on the East Coast . the government plans a further slash in the amount of gasoline to be allowed civilian motorists in this area . Suggestions to cut the fuel-oil allowance to householders have been studied but , according to reports , there is strong opposition to any substantial cut , on the ground that the health hazards created by reducing allowable home temperatures below 65 degrees are too great to justify more than a slight decrease . A formal announcement on both 1 these proposals is expected later in the week from the War Production Board . Official concern over the difficulties in transporting petroleum to the Atlantic Coast area , where gasoline rationing is in effect , was evident in many quarters here today . Shipments by railroad tank car , which have exceeded 800,000 barrels a day in some weeks , declined to 753,594 barrels a day last week , and averaged 759,233 the week before . This fact was called to the attention of the WPB at its regular weekly meeting today , along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rations . Although no official announcement of the WPB 's action was made , one report was that the board had actually approved a proposed slash of one-fourth in the gasoline allowance to be given " A " card holders in the seventeen Eastern States . In. addition , it was stated , the // EAST FACES CUTS IN GAS , FUEL OIL // board had instructed the Office of Price Administration , Federal rationing agency , to re-examine applications of those receiving supplemental ' rations under " B " and " C " cards with a view to eliminating as many as possible . Earlier in the day , Harold L. Ickes , Petroleum Coordinator for War , issued a statement calling attention to the serious transportation problem in supplying the needs of the Eastern region and meeting the heavy demands for fuel oil from the Army forces in Africa . He asked Eastern drivers to remember that " every gallon , 1 yes , every pint " of fuel used for non-essential driving in this region was taking up valuable space in tank cars or pipelines needed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our troops in Africa was going to depend largely on the petroleum supplies we could ship to them . Failure to make every economy " would be nothing less than disloyalty , " he declared . " We need to reduce our civil consumption to the irreducible minimum and it is my deep hope that this can be done voluntarily just as far as possible , " Mr. Ickes said . " Otherwise , I can see no way in which we can supply enough gasoline to maintain the present value of coupons . " Ralph K. Davies , Assistant Coordinator , in making public the figures showing a decline in tankcar shipments last sveex , added the ' warning that because of changing conditions in wartime " there is no way of assuring the public that any certain amount of fuel oil will be delivered into the East Coast by rail . " " Every effort . of course , is being made  --  and will continue to be made  --  to supply the East with its requirements , " he added , " but it must be understood that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He cited among these factors , the diversion of the output of eighteen Midwest refineries from fuel oil to the production of petroleum coke , needed by war industries , last week ; cold weather in northern Midwestern States which reduced shipments of oil eastward , and diversion of oil for the use of railroads , whose reserve supplies have been rapidly exhausted by the above-normal demands upon the transportation facilities . Officials who discussed the posIsibility of a cut in fuel oil rations for householders said that such a ' move was possible but that it would be limited to 5 per cent . As1 it is now , home owners are to be allowed an average of 66 2-3 per cent of the fuel oil they burnedl last year , an amount estimated as sufficient to maintain home temperatures at 65 degrees . An additional 5 per cent might be possible , it was said , but it would be undertaken only after the savings possible in other lines had been thoroughly studied and found insufficient . With reference to gasoline , the Office of Price Administration announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extension of gasoline rationing originally scheduled for Nov. 22 . Difficulty in getting the 234,000,000 pieces of literature printed and distributed in time have made it impossible to put the regulation into effect on the original date .
