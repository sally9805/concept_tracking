Thousands of visiting Democrats and a few donkeys appeared in Chicago last week . Most of the donkeys ( on the hoof and on signs ) were soon removed . Exactly why , delegates to the Democratic Party 's 28th National Convention had to judge for themselves : unexplained mysteries were the rule in Chicago . On a wall of the Convention 's vast ( 21,000 seats ) Chicago Stadium , a huge picture of a donkey was replaced by a spotlighted , grisly sketch of Franklin Roosevelt . Assiduously distributed were 500,000 campaign buttons , adorned not by a donkey but by a bright red cock-o ' - the- walk and the legend : " Just Roosevelt . " <P> Observers said they had never seen such a convention . The Republicans had been leaderless ; the Democrats had been bossed into apathy . They were there for just one purpose , and they knew it-to nominate Franklin D. Roosevelt . Those who were not on the Democratic payroll made no secret of their discontent . <P> One delegate brought a dash of vigor and verve along with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all intents it was written at the White House ) , San Antonio 's gobliny Mayor Maury Maverick prescribed for the Democratic Party " that aggressive spirit which has made it great . " He evoked the Mavericks who pioneered in Texas : " They came praying to God and shootin ' Indians . That 's the way this country was built and it 's the way it 's got to be kept alive . " One night-Maury Maverick continued-his wife found him praying , said she was " glad that you are praying for our boy . " <P> " I 'm sorry to disappoint you , honey , " the mayor quoted himself , " but I 'm not praying for our boy . I 'm praying for the British Navy and the Bank of England . " <P> But even Maury Maverick succumbed to the pall that hung over Chicago . Said he , surveying the lacklustre scenes at the Stevens hotel ( " World 's Greatest " ) , where the National Committee was quartered : " This convention is like a mystery story in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After eight years of power , the Democratic Party still had strength . What was lacking as the convention opened in Chicago was an outlet . Silent at the White House , remote on the Potomac , Franklin Roosevelt had dammed the only outlet , presumably would open it in his own good time . Some of his victims cursed the baffling indignity of their position ; a few cursed the man who had created and preserved it , simply by letting them assume instead of know that they were there to ratify Nomination III . <P> Despite all the traditional hocus-pocus of bands and bunting , platform committees and " keynote " oratory , the forms and panoply had no more meaning than they had had at Philadelphia , before Wendell Willkie and his freshening forces swept the Republicans ' fog away . To the Convention 's keynoter , Alabama 's William Brockman Bankhead , the 1940 campaign seemed to be nothing more than a necessary footnote . Said he : " The minds of the American people are now so deeply engrossed in . . . the preservation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have no tolerance for the superficial banalities of politics . An election must be held , but . . . the major objective of both parties must be unity and solidarity of purpose . . . . "
