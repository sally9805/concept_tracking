In London , last week , one of the strangest of living politicians , Count Michael Karolyi , Tolstoyan , Socialist and Hungarian nobleman , was closely noting his country 's confused and frantic efforts to break with Germany . <P> They began when the Red Army , having swept up most of southeastern Europe , began to roll across the Alfld , the vast Hungarian plain , toward Budapest . Aged ( 76 ) Regent Admiral Nicholas Horthy had asked the Allies for an armistice . Thereupon Major Ferenc Szlasi , Hungarian Nazi leader , took over the Government . The Germans took over Horthy , carried him off to Germany , together with Hungary 's national gold reserve of 80,000,000 peng ( $27,500,000 ) . But the Hungarian peace delegation had already flown to Moscow . <P> Last week , Colonel General Janos Vrs , chief of the Hungarian Army general staff , who had gone over to the Red Army , broadcast an appeal to his troops from Moscow , ordered them to desert with their weapons and equipment to the Russian side . General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's regency . Though the Russians for more than two decades had denounced the testy old Admiral as a fascist , General Vrs ended his broadcast to Hungarians with the words : " Long live free , democratic Hungary under the leadership of Regent Horthy . " <P> Well might Karolyi wonder . For he had played no small part in Hungary 's present plight . After World War I , he had become Hungary 's premier and first president . He began by giving away his estates ( value : $15,000,000 ) . He ended by giving away his Government . <P> At 9 o'clock , one night in 1919 , a messenger came to the jail where Karolyi had imprisoned Communist Bela Kun . In his cell , Kun was informed that Karolyi had quit , that Kun was free to set up a soviet republic in Hungary . Said Bela Kun later : " All night I could not get it out of my head-es ging zu glatt , es ging zu glatt-it went too smoothly . " The 133-day Red Terror that followed gave Hungarians a psychic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany .
