txt The United States " will not follow Mr. Molotov in a retreat - from Potsdam to Yalta " and will not accept the Russian figure of $10,000,000,000 as a basis for German reparations to the Soviet Union , Secretary of State Marshall told the Council of Foreign Ministers today . This dramatic statement closed a long and conclusive rebuttal to Soviet charges that the United States had looted patents and gold in Germany . Stripped of its diplomatic verbiage , of which there was precious little , General Marshall 's statement said that Foreign Minister Molotov had his facts wrong . Yesterday the Soviet Foreign Minister released the hitherto secret protocol on reparations that was signed at the Yalta conference . Today General Marshall emphatically presented the United States view that the Yalta provisions had been superseded by the reparations agreements at the Potsdam conference . In the Yalta protocol , as released by Mr. Molotov , the Big Three powers agreed to deliveries from German current production as one form of reparal tions . The Potsdam Declaration neither provides for nor bans such deliveries ; it says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used " in the first place " to pay for imports . Soviet Obtaining Patents In answering the Soviet charge concerning patents , Secretary Marshall said that Amtorg , the Soviet trading corporation , had bought at a nominal price the largest portion of the pamphlets on German patents released by the United States Department of Commerce . Mr. Molotov had charged that these patents , together with gold and other things seized by the United States and Britain in their I zones , amounted to reparations worth more than $10,000,000,000 . This Secretary Marshall strongly denied . Then , taking the offensive , the Secretary of State quoted a letter from John C. Green of the Department of Commerce asking that the United States receive access to scientific and technological information that the Russians had taken from their zone of occupation . This access was requested on terms similar to those whereby the Russians are acquiring a mass of material from the United States . A veteran spectator at Big Four meetings said later that he had rarely seen Mr. Molotov so shaken as he appeared to be at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a calm , matter-of-fact tone that made it all the more effective . British Position Backed This Russo-American exchange followed an earlier oral duel between Mr. Molotov and Foreign Secretary Bevin of Britain . Mr. Bevin defended the British position on patents and said that " it is so easy to make misleading statements . " Earlier in the sessior Foreign Minister Bidault of France had presented a paper in which France refused to consider a change in the German level of industry , called for strict limitation of German coal consumption and steel production and backed the principles of the United States proposal for a four-power , Iong-term treaty to insure German disarmament . M. Bidault 's visit to Premier Stalin last night apparently has not affected French ideas on the economic treatment of Germany . Whereas the Russians yesterday plumped for a higher level of industry in Germany , the French Foreign Minister declared today that France considered that Germany 's steel-making capacity , on which the level of industry is based , should stay where it is7,500,000 tons a year . M. Bidault also opposed the organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed yesterday , so long as the frontiers of Germany were not fixed . The Frenchman threw into his speech a suggestion that in the future German coal be moved to France to make steel of French iron instead of France 's " sending our iron to Germany so the Germans can make steel out of it . " Secretary Marshall 's statement today was by all odds the most effective answer that any of the three Western powers had yet ! made to the extravagant charges on Germany by Mr. Molotov , Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Y. Vishinsky and the Soviet press . The basis of his final words was Russia 's statement , made yesterday , that Russian reparations claims of $10,000,000,000 had been agreed upon at tht Yalta conference by the United States delegation . President Truman 's speech of Aug. 9 , 1945 , clearly stated the United States ' understanding that the Yalta provisions on reparations were superseded by the Potsdam decisions , Secretary Marshall said . The figure of $20,000,000,000 in reparations , one-half of which was to go to Russia , was discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped at Potsdam , the Secretary continued . The reason for this , he explained patiently , was that - at Potsdam it was agreed that the idea of fixing a dollar value on the reparations shares of each nation would be the sort of guarantee that might be impossible to fulfill . General Marshall recalled that Mr. Molotov raised in Paris in July , 1946 , the same supposed Yalta agreemen . James F. Byrnes , then Secretary of State , had already pointed out , General Marshall said , quoting from his predecessor 's speech in Paris , that what President Roosevelt had agreed to at Yalta was only a discussion of the Soviet figure of $10,000,000,000 in reparations for Russia . " The position of the United States Government * * * is that the agreements at Potsdam supersede the preliminary agreements previously at Yalta , " Secretary Marshall 's statement concluded " We will not follow Mr. Molotov in a retreat from Potsdam to Yalta . " ing the text of the letter from Mr. Secretary Marshall reversed today the familiar Soviet stratagem of picking up offhand words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text for some new demand or claim . Mr. Molotov had quoted Mr. I Green , who is director of the Office of Technical Services in the Department of Commerce , on the importance of exports of patents to the United States . General Marshall replied by reading the text of a letter from Mr. Green to the State Department asking that the United States receive the same access to technical processes and scientific information taken from the Soviet zone that the Russians have to similar information held by the Americans . The Secretary emphasized , as Mr. Bevin had earlier , that the Western powers were not making any money out of Germany , but were , on the contrary , pouring money and material into their zones . He also said that the United States had not accepted ownership of captured German gold , as Mr. Molotov had charged , and it was pointed out that Hungarian gold seized by the Germans already had been returned to Hungary . Secretary Marshall 's tone throughout this section of the session was that of a patient instructor with a small boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange on reparations between Mr. Molotov and Mr. Bevin there was perhaps one positive achievement . This was an agreement between the Briton and the Russian to produce figures on reparations from their respective zones . The Soviet figures , when they appear , will be the first Russia has made public . Molotov Lists " Seizures " Mr. Molotov rang all the changes on the supposed seizure of reparations by the United States and Britain . They have taken , he said , " all German gold , " " all German external assets , " " a considerable amount of the German commercial fleet * * * and a great number of patents and inventions that , according to the Soviet press , equal more than $10,000,1 000,000 . " It was an unhappy circumstance that these brisk exchanges between General Marshall and Mr. Molotov , and Mr. Molotov and Mr. Sevin.
