txt 13y Cable to ' Mrs NET , ' ' roam TIDIES . LONDON , Dec. ** the first time in Britain 's industrial history young men eligible for service in the armed forces are to be conscripted for work in essential war industry . This was made known today when Labor Minister Ernest Bevin announced in the House of Commons that within the next few days ballots would be drawn to determine which young men between the , ages of 17 and 25 years would make up the first contingent of perhaps 30,000 new miners , who will be needed up to the end of next April . After explaining that the suggestion was made in Commons last October by the Minister of Fuel and Power , Maj. Gwilym . Lloyd George , that it would soon benecessary to call up men for the mines in the same way as for the armed services , Mr. Bevin said a plan had been worked out and " will begin to operate shortly . " Rather than draw on men from the coal-mining areas exclusively , it was decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manpower just as military conscription does , Mr. Bevin reported . The only men who will not come within the scope of the plan are those accepted for flying duty with the Royal Air Force or the Fleet Air Arm ; men accepted as artificers in submarines and men highly skilled in a limited number of occupations who are already sub // ject to call only for certain service trades and heretofore were not even acceptable as coal mine volunteers . Selection of the new miners is to be made from among men born on or after Jan. 1 , 1918 , who would otherwise be called up for the armed services and placed in Medical Grade 1 or 2 . The object of the plan is to be impartial , and the method worked out will be recognized as fair and at the same time will not put the duty of selecting according to merit and suitability on the officials of the Fuel and Power Ministry . None of the new miners will go into the pits before January , it was announced , but during the first four months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rate of 7,500 a month , after which the monthly quota is likely to drop to 2,500 . Those chosen for the work will receive a medical examination and there will be a special examination for men who claim they have medical reasons for being unfit for coal mining . Men without prior coal mining experience will be sent to a ' training center , where they will toughen up physically while learning the practical and theoretical fundamentals of the job . This course will be divided into four parts , of which about 25 per cent will be physical training , 30 per cent below-ground practical training , 20 per cent surface work and 25 per cent classroom work . The training week will be fortyfour hours long and the men will be paid at a minimum rate of about $8 for those 17 years old to almost $16 for those of 21 years or more . After completing training , the men will be posted at collieries , where they will get further training for two weeks before starting work under ground . For a period of at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come under the close personal supervision of experienced miners . During the period of surface training before going into the pits they will receive surface workers ' pay . As far as possible , the Government will try to post men at the coalfields they prefer , but , because the productivity of the pits and facilities for housing and feeding men are considerations , there can be no guarantee that a man will always be posted where he chooses . Compensation for injury will be the same as for those injured in the mercantile marine and it will come under the Workmen 's Compensation Act . Miners thus chosen will rank equally with service men in the matter of being demobilized after the war , although details on this count have not yet been worked out .
