What will the 80th Congress do about labor ? At least one man had some answers : Minnesota 's Republican Senator Joe Ball , who was drafting some legislation last week . <P> A onetime St. Paul newspaper man , friend of Harold Stassen , and an ardent internationalist , Joe Ball has been called a liberal . In 1944 he crossed party lines to support Franklin Roosevelt against Tom Dewey . But since then , organized labor has soured on him . Ball 's belief in the individual does not jibe with labor 's belief in the union . He has made it clear that he thinks organized labor has gained too much power . <P> Three principles should govern a new national labor policy , he thinks . First , disputes should be settled as far as possible by collective bargaining ; he rejects the idea of labor courts rendering arbitrary decisions . Second , Government should stay out of labor disputes except where the lawful rights of individuals or the interests of the public are paramount . Third , all parties should be given equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor 's Magna Carta . Getting down to specific measures , Joe Ball frankly admits that he can not dot all the i 's . The best he can do in some cases is point out reforms . These are high on his list : the need for better federal mediation machinery ; the need to discourage industry-wide bargaining ( to which " the only answer so far has been Government seizure " ) ; the need to protect individuals and minorities within a union ( who are now the victims of " monopolies as vicious as any attempted by the unlamented trusts of a few decades ago " ) . One way to afford that protection says Joe Ball , is to " outlaw the closed shop . " <P> " The closed shop , " said Joe Ball , " is about the most reactionary and unliberal institution that we have developed . No liberal who believes in individual freedom can regard it as anything else . " <P> One long-term problem which is getting his close attention is labor 's so-called Magna Carta , the Wagner Act . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be outlawed ; that unions as well as employers should be required to bargain ; that certain legal reforms are in order . <P> Equal Rights . Finally , he believes that at some stage of a strike- " after three , six or nine months " - employers should be allowed to fire striking employes . This would be a serious blow at the Wagner Act . Under the Wagner Act , no matter how long an employe stays out on strike , his job is safe . " The present definition has decreased too much the employe 's risks in a strike and increased the employer 's risks . " <P> The employer 's right which matches the employes ' right to strike , said Ball , is " his right to beat the strike by lawful means if he feels the union demands make a settlement impossible . " <P> Those are some of the tenets which Joe Ball-who , along with Ohio 's Bob Taft and New Jersey 's H. Alexander Smith , will be in charge of drafting labor legislation-will offer the new Congress . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predict that there will be substantial changes in the direction I have outlined .
