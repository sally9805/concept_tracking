Gus THE GREAT ( 703 pp. ) - Thomas W. Duncan-Lipplncotf ( $3.50 ) . <P> Thomas Duncan , a down &; out ex-Harvard man , has written a rags-to-riches story , and as a result is about to enjoy a rags-to-riches life himself . His novel is the Book-of-the-Month Club selection for September ( touted by Book Selector John P. Marquand as " head &; shoulders . . . above any fiction we have examined this year " ) . It has already been peddled to Hollywood . <P> A jug-eared , sardonic lowan of 42 , Harvard cum laude Author Duncan spent ten years on Gus the Great and was nearly broke much of the time . An itinerant writer , teacher and Chautauqua actor , he is the author of three previous novels , all poor sellers . He retired to a trailer to finish Gus the Great , wandering through the West and Southwest . When the money ran low , Duncan hacked out short stories on a 1924 Corona ; his wife , Actea , took a secretarial job . The Duncans ' first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convertible . <P> Gus the Great is a roisterous , freewheeling and often very amusing story about a four-flushing circus owner . It straddles two generations of easy-money mischief and scalps a whole zoo full of roguish characters . It is as blusteringly improbable as a W. C. Fields movie , and has some of the same appeal . Beneath the bluster , Gus the Great skillfully satirizes the great American success story . <P> Its hero , " Honest Gus " Burgoyne , was born over a saloon and " christened ... in honor of two men , either of whom might have been his father . " As a small-town reporter , he learned how to shake down politicians ; as city editor , he gained the confidence of the town 's financial wizard , then bedded down in the bovine arms of the wizard 's only daughter , Flora . " Brilliant things coruscated about her face and hair : flashing dollar signs . " <P> Moo &; Moola . They blinded Gus to Flora 's shortcomings , but they could hardly conceal her size . " Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred and fifty pounds of jelly . . . . She had the even disposition of a milch cow . . . and admired Gus as if he were a bale of clover hay . . . . When Gus spent an evening at home she mooed with happiness . " Gus liked the moos , but not as much as the moola . With an elephant borrowed from the city 's amusement park , he hoisted himself into the circus business . <P> From then on , Author Duncan 's ragtag , bobtail characters resemble Betty MacDonald 's farmers , except that his chickens lay golden eggs . In the tinseled , brutal world of prancing ponies and pickpockets , Gus acquires money and mistresses . He sells the pickpocket privilege in the show , trims his partner , boosts his own name into stud-horse type . " When business was high the money rolled in so fast there was no time to sort it , so it was shoved into a bushel basket . . . . Gus enjoyed picking up the basket and feasting his gaze on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the basket , like a bear pawing wild honey . "
