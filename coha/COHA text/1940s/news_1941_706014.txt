" Above all , " he continued , " it seems especially significant that all of us who arc interested in the I maintenance of the values and standards of civilization should see to it that even students who decide that they must in this period concentrate upon technology should also be induced to study as many aspects of the social sciences and the humanities as possible . Well Combine " Where possible , colleges and universities may well combine frank military or naval training with their regular course work . In this period it seems to me especially important to recognize that that basic plan of the army and navy reserve officers training corps in many of our colleges is a sound one . By this plan it is possible for young men to an forward in the liberal arts or engineering field and at the same time prepare themselves for emergency duty as reserve officers .
