THE SUN IS MY UNDOINGHercules . Expecting an explosion , Matthew was tickled to see the old man lying back on his pillows , calmly smoking his pipe . Catching his grandson 's eye , Hercules lowered an eyelid . Matthew thought delightedly , " There 's plenty of life in the old boy yet ! " And , as Ann Flood 's dreary voice droned on , there was born in his mind the audacious scheme for Hercules ' amusement that was to be put into effect  --  with such dire results  --  on the following night . " I hope you will meditate on those words , Father , " said Ann , as she snapped to the leaves of her Bible , to Jason 's nasal " Amen . " " Aye , I 'm more likely to meditate with me pipe in me mouth than I am when yer impident meddlin ' deprives me of it , " grunted Hercules . Ann caught Jason 's eye , and the latter shrugged his shoulders slightly . It was obviously impossible to order Matthew out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such assurance . Thinking that he would consult his lawyer on the matter tomorrow ( he had forgottenit was Sunday ) , Jason bade the confederates a cold good-night and accepted , without comment , Africa 's grinning escort to the front door . He spent the journey home in assuring his flustered wife that , with Clay 's assistance , there would be little difficulty in removing this unwelcome poacher on the family preserves . IVTo do Matthew justice , it was not until the morning after the tragedy that he began to reflect that he had by his foolish conduct not only hastened his grandfather 's death , but had forfeited his last chance of escape . There was now nothing for it but to surrender to his creditors , or , alternatively , to flee the country . It crossed his mind to wonder if there might be a hope that his grandfather had previously relented to the extent of some small legacy that could be used to stave off disaster . It would , perhaps , be wise to wait for the reading of the will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their decency and respect for the dead to allow him to remain at large until the funeral was over . Meanwhile his position was ticklish ; his flight to Bristol had exhaustedthe last sovereign he possessed in the world , and he had but a handful of small change to see him over the time which must elapse before the tremendous pomps and ceremonies of the obsequies took place . There was nothing for it but to dig in his heels , to resist all pos-BRISTOL 41sible attempts of Jason to oust him from his present lodging until the funeral was over , and to exercise his brain over some possible solution of the situation if the hope he hardly dared to cherish proved vain . CHAPTER IVIS IT true that Matthew Flood has come back ? " inquired Lydia Burmester of her husband on the morning of the scandal , to be instantly reproached by her daughter Orabella . " Oh , Mamma , have n't we told you ? Clara Peddy assures us  --  " " He is back , " said Ralph Burmester , cutting shortly into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed Lydia , in her gentle , abstracted voice that reduced all subjects to an equal level of unimportance . It was the voice she would employ for an earthquake , for a butterfly caught in a net , for an event of national significance , or for a new petticoat ; it proceeded from some calm , philosophic depth of her being that had never known disturbance . In these days she would be called a fatalist . " The house must be melancholy for a young man . With such old friends as ourselves , there 's surely no need to observe the conventions ? Why do you not ask him to dine ? " Ralph cast a quick look at his daughters and then at his wife ; she returned it as calmly as though she were blind , and it struck him , not for the first time , to wonder if she were sufficiently aware of her responsibilitiesas mother of two beautiful and high-spirited girls . " Oh , do do , Papa ! " pressed Orabella . " I should so like to see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dull boy ! " Ralph frowned . " We shall see . And now , if you please , I wish to speak to Pallas . Will you come to my room , my child ? " The elder girl rose , and it was as though a young tree soared upward , so tall , for those clays , was Miss Pallas , in her India muslin gown , whose tiny , rust-coloured pattern ran like a covey of ladybirds into the snowy valleys of flounce and fluting . Her hair , of that warm , chestnut-red that accompanies , as surely as flowers the spring , clear , sea-coloured42BRISTOL 43eyes and a complexion of radiant pallor , was drawn by a dark green scarf away from the lovely face , whose humour was no less marked than its dignity . It was too early in the morning for the ladies of the household to have assumed their hoops , and the soft material of her negligee was moulded into classic grace by her free young limbs . " I am always at your disposal , Papa , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but I hope you do not need to scold me this morning , for I am in a terrible bad mood for scolding ! " " Now , Pally , " said Ralph as he closed the study door upon them , " you know you are getting altogether too much of a great girl to be scolded . " " I am entirely of your opinion , Papa ! And am I right in presuming that , if there were more gallantry in the opposite sex , the occasion for it would n't arise ? " She stood playing with a curtain rope , her head on one side , her charming lips curved in a smile of shrewdness and amusement . " Egad , it is n't lack of gallantry that you should complain of , miss ! " " Indeed it is , Papa ! Forgive me for contradicting you , but there 's gallantry and gallantry . I do n't give a snap of my fingers for all the pretty speeches in the world , if their inventor goes snivelling to my papa that I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , have you not ? " " I do n't understand . Politeness obliges me to make myself agreeable to people who sometimes bore me until I could cry ! I wonder , Papa , if you 've ever noticed that I 'm intelligent ? " Ralph could not help smiling . " Remember , Pally , that too much intelligence is not becoming in a woman . " " Well , " said Pallas , having thought it over , " you can not expect me to take seriously people who treat me like a doll , who have no interest in me , excepting for my hair , my hands , my shoulders , or some such accidental matter to which , to be sure , I pay some attention , but which I do n't want to be reminded of every time I open my mouth . I know it is the fashion to treat women so , but it is a fashion which will not do for me ! " Looking at his daughter 's high , imperious head , Ralph could well believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage to some West Country bumpkin who would not know how to appreciate the rare qualities that were hers , but since " better things " didcc44 THE SUN IS MY UNDOINGnot offer , she would have to pitch her tune to a lower note or remain permanently on his hands  --  a future which , not for his own sake , but for hers , Ralph refused to contemplate . " Papa , if you can believe it ! I was talking to Charles Gosselin for nearly half an hour yesterday about Mr. Swift 's lovely poem , Windsor Forest ' ; you know he fancies himself a great naturalist , so I thought he would surely be interested to hear how vividly a poet , even if he be not a professor of natural science , can describe the pheasant . " Ali ! what avail his glossy , varying dyes , His purple crest and scarlet-circled eyes , The vivid green his shining plumes unfold , His painted wings and breast that flames with gold ? " And what do you think the great fool said when I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and he answered , I can not tell ; for when you speak I only hear the beauty in your voice : " " You must not be too hard upon our unfortunate sex , Pally . And if you do not take care , you will get yourself the reputation of a heartlessflirt . It is absurd , at your age , that you are not married ; and , let me tell you , your mother and I are finely criticized for the way we allow you to do as you please in this matter of your own freedom . " " Darling Papa ! You and Mamma are the most exceptional and perfectof parents . But you must not be puffed up about it ! " She had the impudence to add , " Because if everyone else is stupid , and you are not , it does not mean anything very much ; but if all the world were full of intelligent people , and you were the shining stars amid the assembly , it would mean a very great deal ! Dear , sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bullying me into a marriage , because you are so much more sensible than all these foolish people  --  " There was a hint of breathlessness , even of apprehension , in her voice , all the same ; the eyes which looked into his were not devoid of a faint anxiety , which Ralph turned his head away sharply to avoid . " That is all very well , Pally ; but it is a state of affairs of which , in my opinion , you have taken too much advantage , and which can not be allowed to continue . " The severity of his tone quenched her high spirits ; it was several moments before , pressing the palms of her hands together , she replied , very quietly : " I would be prepared to marry tomorrow if you would find for meBRISTOL 45the right person . I can imagine nothing more dreadful than to live with a person to whom you can not tell everything in confidence of his sympathy and understanding , who does not accord to you the same confidence you give to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to share every interest in his life , and to give him full share in mine . I want to be treated not only as a housekeeper , or a childbearer , but as the true partner in his thoughts and as a person entitled to thoughts and opinions of my own . Perhaps I aspire too far , but I 'm sure that such a relationship exists  --  even between men and women ; and I 'd rather die an old maid than put up with a substitute ! " " You are talking for effect , " said Ralph , losing his temper . " It is the fashion among pretty young women to swear that they 'd sooner die old maids than forfeit some foolish figure of fancy born in their idle imaginations . But it is time for you to recognize the responsibilities proper to your sex and station . " " What may those be , Papa ? " asked Pallas with a dangerous demureness . " For it seems to me that , if a woman is obliged to assume responsibilities , she should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that women of the future wo n't put up with the treatment some of them receive today  --  not for all the compensation in the world ! " " Pally , if you do n't take care , you will end by making me seriously angry , " said Ralph . " What compensation can a woman require , pray , more than the comforts and luxuries a husband provides her with ? " " Correct me if I am wrong , Papa  --  and of course , on this subject I am not so very well informed  --  but I am persuaded that bearing childrenis not so very luxurious a process , from a woman 's point of view . " " It is a woman 's natural vocation ! " roared Ralph . " And if you now , miss , were at your proper task of rearing a new generation , you would have the less time to spare in quibbling over questions your husband would decide for you . " " I am the worst of fools to annoy him , " Pallas thought when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has never plagued me , the way other girls are plagued by their fathers , and has never been anything but the soul of patience with all my whims . " She took out of the workbag which , at her father 's summons , she had looped over her arm the piece of silk she was stitching into some conceit for Lydia 's birthday , and , with a philosophical air , threaded a magenta strand into her needle. 46 THE SUN IS MY UNDOINGII " Oh , Pally  --  Pally ! " Both bag and embroidery were snatched away , the first hurled into a corner , the second stretched like a canopy over Orabella 's head , as she danced about the room , enchanting as a figure from a Grecian urn . " Oh , Pally ! " She stopped to draw breath . " How can you be so prim as to get on with your stitching  --  with thousands of things happening and so much excitement in the air ? And you need n't pretend that you are n't ready to jump out of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dine ! " " If you were not just sixteen , " observed Pallas , unable to prevent the colour from rising to her lower eyelids , as she followed her sister back to the parlour , " I should slap you . Why should I be so foolish , considering that every night , more or less , there are gentlemen to dinner ? "  --  which was true , the Burmesters being one of the few Bristol families who , at that time , entertained on a generous scale in their own homes . " Why , indeed ! " Saucy Miss Orabella was twisting the embroidery into a turban for her curls of ripe corn . " Oh , I know you , Pally ! You have n't quite the sagacity of the goddess for whom you were christened  --  Pallas Athene , goddess of wisdom . I bet she knew more than to give herself away the way you 've done these last few hours ! " " Orabella ! " Smitten with contrition , the younger girl ran to fling her arms about her sister 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' T was vulgar of me , but I meant no harm . And it 's all so romantic , my heart 's in a flutter already  --  feel ! " Seizing Pallas 's hand , she pressed it over her soft , immature breast . " Is yours like that ? " Bending her head , she laid it to her sister's. bosom . " You 're  --  you 're crazy ! " cried Pallas , thrusting her away and turning hurriedly toward the fire . Picking up a screen , she made heat the pretextfor shadowing her face . Orabella stood still , her hands linked together , her feet in their heellesssatin slippers pressed side to side , like a child reciting a lesson . " So that 's why you kept the little musical box ! And why , instead of throwing the broken pieces away , you had them made into a pin for your gown . I guessed it when you made such a fuss last week , when you as good as accused poor Betty of stealing a thing not worth moreBRISTOL 47than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Pally , who 'd sooner go to jail herself than get anyone into trouble ! ' And when it was found , where it had slipped down at the back of the drawer  --  oh , Pally , was there any need to dance with joy and present Betty with a crown , to make up for your fault-finding ? Had you to sing , and sparkle , and finger the thing throughout a whole morning ? " " Your attentiveness to all that does not concern you is well-nigh in , tolerable at times , Orry ! " " Indeed it does concern me ! " indignantly retorted Orabella . " It 's not so agreeable , let me tell you , when one has left the schoolroom , to have a sister of twenty , still unmarried , about the house . How can I expect the fellows to regard me seriously when you are here ? " Pallas 's lips twitched involuntarily into a smile . " I 'm sure I am very sorry , " she answered humbly . " And I will take pains to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You know that is not what I mean . " Orabella stamped her foot . " Dearest Pally ! One might as well talk of the moon making herself inconspicuous , when you have only to sit and every man who sees you falls madly in love with you . I did think , by the way , you might have taken Roger Furnivall ; ' twas n't as if he were a Bristol man . Oh , lud , I often despair for myself when I look at these Bristol fellows , so uncouth , so stupid , so unwieldy in drawing-rooms " " It 's very ungracious of you to talk like that about Bristol men , " Pallas reproved her . " Especially as it does n't prevent you from flirting with them ! And , even if they are a little dull , they are the worthiest fellows in the world . I doubt if any town in Britain can show such a roll of heroes as ours since the wars began . " A faint  --  and wholly unintentional  --  noteof patronage did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat neutralized the moral effect of the speech . " Oh-oh , I suppose that 's why you 've fallen in love with so many of them ! Come , Pally , be honest : is it not true that a man may be a hero and yet be the dullest bore that ever existed ? The wars may have called out their courage ; they certainly have n't improved their manners , " pouted Orabella . " Nor their looks , if it comes to that ! Oh , dear , it looks as if there would n't be any whole men left by the time I come to marry . I could never do like Herminia Bond ; I vow I 'd evaporate at the very thought of marrying a man with only one arm ! " " There 's not a nobler nor more gallant man living than Sherlock48 THE SUN IS MY UNDOINGBond ! " said Pallas indignantly . " And you should be ashamed of yourself , Orry , for talking so of our brave protectors  --  the more so that your conduct does not bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reduced to flirting with the washing-poles if these horrid wars go on ! " said the impenitent Orabella . " Actually , I 'm very glad indeed you have n't fallen in love , Pally ; for , knowing what you are , I 'm quite sure you 'd have married him if he 'd come back to you in pieces ! You 're just the sort of foolish , fond creature who 'd have devoted her life to leading a blind man or a cripple about . Oh , damn  --  oh , damn the wars ! It 's bad enough not to be able to get any more of those lovely stuffs from France , without having all our admirers reduced to eyeshades and crutches , and hardly a soul to stand up with when it comes to a minuet . Of course , there 's no point in denying that those who have stayed at home are not the ones one would choose to be seen with " " Come ; either you must give me back my sewing , or I 'll make you practise our duet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the morning , to sit gossiping like a pair of old maids . " Quickly Orabella turned and flung her arms about her sister 's knees . " Pally , you ca n't deceive me . Oh , Pally , do n't be so mean ! Though I chatter a lot , you know I can be as secret as the grave . Only admit that you are even more thrilled than I by Matthew 's return ! That ever since he broke your musical box , which you would n't even allow me to touch  --  oh , Pally , I would n't have broken it !  --  you 've thought of no one else , and that 's why you 've disappointed so many , and put Papa in so bad a temper ! " Defeated , Pallas closed her eyes and put her hand to her brow . Her silence lasted so long that Orabella , a little frightened , crept to her side and crouched into the billows of her gown . At last , painfully : " I  --  I do not even understand myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I know what you mean . " Quivering , yet taken aback by her victory , Orabella enclosed Pallas 's hand shyly in her own . " ' T is almost terrifying , is it not , that , even in childhood , one is not immune from Cupid 's darts ? Oh , dearest Pally , to think of the years you have cherishedyour secret ! " " It at least shows what folly the human mind is capable of ! " Pallas forced a laugh . " Suppose he has changed ? I hope you wo n't swoon when you meet him again , " said Orabella anxiously . BRISTOL 49 " Indeed , I can promise you that ! ' T is not at all becoming for women of my type to swoon , " said Pallas with severity . " They would say it was a chimney coming down ! " " Oh , Pally , not a chimney ! A lovely larch tree , perhaps  --  " " And so far as that goes , " went on Pallas , ignoring the flattering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first glance , to forfeit my illusions . I shall probably wonder whatever trick my fancy played , to weave such thoughts about a very commonplace individual ! And now , if you please , Orry , we will not mention this again . I did not mean you to know about it . If you were not such a curious , spying little thing ! " " Oh , I 'm a horrid sister ! But at least I adore my beautiful Pally , and care for nothing but her happiness . Lud ! How I shall thrill , when I see you two together ! " " Now remember , Orry ! There must be no mischief  --  no sly glances and foolish remarks , such as I know you are quite capable of making . " " Indeed , I shall be the very pink of propriety ! How could you think I should ever betray my darling Pally ? But there will be no need of betrayal ; ' twill all be settled from the moment he claps eyes on you . Does n't every man adore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Blake , and William Goffin practically come to blows over who should light you home from the Merchants ' Ball ? " " You 're talking like a little fool . Is it likely  --  I ask you , Orabella , is it likely  --  that a man who has had the run of London society should have eyes for a Bristol bumpkin ? " For all her brave assumption of commonsense , there was a touch of bitterness in the last words . " Ah , now I know why you 've been so black under the eyes and anxious-looking since Betty called you ! " said the far too sagacious Orabellawith a nod . " You need n't worry  --  a touch of ill health becomes you . And if Mr. Matthew Flood considers that there is a woman in society who can hold a candle to my sister , I shall snap my fingers at him , " she concluded staunchly . " After that , " said Pallas , rising , as a sign that the subject was closed , " you can hardly refuse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lapsed upon the soles of her slippers , Orabella made a moue of discontent . " You 're always plaguing me for a shilling , and I 'm sure I 'll need all I 've got toward that hat we were both admiring that 's to go with my blue and gold Turkey sack ! I suppose it 's for one of your tiresome charities ? " 50 1'I1E SUN ISMY UNDOING " Just a little sixpence , " pleaded Pallas . " I 'm short nearly a crownof last month 's collection , and I ca n't abide to deprive the poor creaturesof their needs . " " What poor creatures ? " frowned Orabella . " You heard Mr. Jason 's appeal last night , " Pallas reproached her . " Why do you fuss yourself about Negroes ? " Orabella scrambled to her feet , shaking down her tumbled petticoats . " I 'm sure you ca n't say people in Bristol treat their black servants badly ; and I know I 'd much sooner belong to a kind English master than live in a savage country where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak of thecreatures that bite and sting , and all the horrid diseases . Oh , it must be a disgusting country ! " " How would you like , " cried Pallas , as , with her head in the air , Orabella began to walk away , " how would you like to have an iron collar welded round your neck , with your owner 's name upon it'This Negro is the property of  --  of John Peddy , say , of the city of Bristol ' ? " " I should n't object at all , provided the collar was of an agreeable pattern , " perversely retorted Orabella , " and I only wish somebody would give me a little black boy , like Lady Gannet 's Absalom , that I could dress up and make a pet of . I declare I could get as fond of him as of my long-haired kitten ! " She turned sharply on her sister toadd , " Has it ever struck you to wonder why Mamma does n't go to the anti-slavery lectures ? " " They do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in anything outside the house . " " Nothing of the sort . If you ask my opinion , " triumphantly said Orabella , " her reason for not going is something she knows about Papa . I should n't be in the least surprised if he has an interest in the slavetrade . Everyone in Bristol has ! " " Oh , no  --  it ca n't be that ! " Pallas had whitened to the tender arches of her lips . " Why not ? Oh , do n't be silly , Pally . Papa is a very rich man , and I 'll bet you the shilling you 're so anxious to get from me that it does n't all come out of weaving . Everybody says the wool industry 's going clown , but we do n't get any poorer . Who cares ? Papa 's at liberty to buy and sell all the slaves he likes , so long as I can get my Turkey gowns ! " " If I thought any gown of mine had come out of that infamous trade , I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I advise you not to make too many inquiries ! " was the pert rejoinder . " I 'm sure you 'd be as sorry to part with that pale pink lutestringor your new yellow ball dress as I 'd be to have no more opportunitiesfor admiring you in them . Oh , do n't , pray , dearest Pally , do n't start to be a reformer ! You 're far too sweet and pretty to waste yourselfon causes ! " There was no lightening of the cloud that had settled on Pallas 's brow . " I shall ask Papa . " Orabella cast a glance at her sister , and shrugged her shoulders . " Ask away . I never met a person as little forthcoming as Papa , unless it suits him . " With the sudden change of topic that so often disconcertedher listeners , she burst forth , " Take last night ! I 've begged and implored him to tell me what he knows  --  for I 'm positive , are n't you , Pally , that he was at Hercules Flood 's ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of him . ' T is too provoking , with Clara Peddy already one up on me for gossip , when I might be a positive mine of information ! " Pallas 's tight lips relaxed as she looked at the sister whom , for all her follies and vanities , she adored . Surprised at the silence , Orabella turned round ; their eyes met , and the next moment they were in each other 's arms . " I 'll give you that shilling , " babbled Orabella , " if you 'll promise not to mention slave-trade for a week ! And even if you insist on being a crazy phil-philan  --  oh , whatever the word is  --  I shall never cease to love you better than anybody in the world ! " III " It is a barbarous town ! " Matthew was thinking as he threaded the narrow streets , with their overhanging signs that forced him , swearing , to duck his head a dozen times in a distance of fifty yards . Having nearly been brained by , successively , a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wheat-sheaf , and a Golden Boy , he was not disposed to appreciate his surroundings . " Keep off , you scum ! " he roared at the driver of one of the sledges that brought the merchandise up from the quays as the uncouth vehicle came lurching and skidding over the cobbles , scattering shrieking pedestrians into doorways and causing stampedeamong the animals  --  goats , sheep , and swine  --  that meandered along the highway as though it were the village green. 52 THE SUN IS MY UNDOINGAlert for pickpockets , he scanned the fulminating population  --  a pockmarked , shifty crowd , whose dubious faces showed every variety of pigmentation that accompanies mixed and foreign blood ; conscious of them as he had never been in the old days , when , as a truant schoolboy , he had mixed with them , taking them as much for granted as he took the respectable tradesfolk behind the counters and finding in them , God knew , more affinity than he found in his home circle . He guessed that it was only his height and the half-conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thugs prepared to risk their lives in assault upon a well-dressed stranger , for he caught many calculating glances that took in his metropolitan style and communicatedit with nods and nudges to neighbours . It gratified him that , so far , none recognized him . There must indeedbe a difference between Mr. Matthew Flood of London and the lout of bygone clays . Now and again , usually from a woman , he got a puzzled look , a look of struggling memory , and turned hastily aside . He had no desire to be greeted by one of the molls whose former favours he had learned to despise . Turning into the more respectable thoroughfare of Broad Street , he halted for a moment , out of idleness and curiosity , to read a bill posted on a wall . TO BE SOLD BY AUCTION AT LITTLE JOHN'SCOFFEE HOUSEOn November 18 , 1760The Full Articles Suitable for a Guinea Voyage , Comprising z Iron Furnace &; Copper , 27 Cases with Bottles , 83 Paires of Shackles , II Neck Collars , 22 Handcuffs for the Travelling Chain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 7 4-Pound Basons , &c.; Always attracted by matters relative to the slave-trade , Matthew read it with interest , speculating what this interesting lot would fetch . He was about to move on when a vast figure , impeding his passage , caused him to step aside to make room for Lawyer Shergill . Matthew greeted him  --  not too warmly . Beyond the fact that he was an unwelcomereminder of the events of the previous night , he could hardly have said what disposed him against this crony of Hercules , who , in the broad light of day , presented a somewhat damaged and shifty ap-BRISTOL 53pearance , despite the immaculacy of his ruffles and the rich elaboration of a broadcloth suit which , in quantity and quality of material , must have cost a fortune . If Matthew was put out by meeting him , it was evident that his sentimentswere not reciprocated , for Shergill stood still , leaning on the thick malacca that steadied his rolling progress , removing his hat with a flourish that might have been considered a trifle excessive from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was annoyed to perceive that their encounter had been observed and was causing a small sensation . " Good day to ye , sir ! " Shergill was observing . " So you 're taking a look round your native town ! We 've made advances , I 'm glad to say , in the last few years . " He said this very loudly , as though for the benefitof onlookers , at the same time giving Matthew a sly glance , as though to warn him from pandering to their curiosity . Already the vicinitywas agog , for Lawyer Shergill 's name had been widely associated with Hercules ' death . Assuming unawareness of their interest , he peered across Matthew 's shoulder at the bill on the wall . " Oh , aye  --  int'restin '  --  very . ' T would have interested me more , a day or two ago . " " Do you dabble in the West African trade ? " asked Matthew carelessly . Shergill lowered his voice as he replied . " The three of us  --  Jack Peddy , myself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taken ill , to buy a fine snow you 'll see in the harbourif you take a stroll that way . ' T is a pity the business was not concluded : there was haggling over the price , and  --  well , they 've missed their sale , for I doubt Jack 'll make up the third share and I 've got too much tied up at present to sink another couple o ' thousand . " " Perhaps you 'll find another partner , " Matthew suggested . " Maybe , maybe , but money 's tight just now , and  --  " Glancing across Matthew 's shoulder , he drew him into a narrow gap between two houses , which they blocked with their broad figures . " The place is hummin ' like a wasps ' nest ; ' t is unfortunate we encountered , " he mumbled . " On the other hand , I was wanting to get hold of you . I 'm sorry for you , me boy ; ' t is a wretched business . " An oily palm fell on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " As an old friend , if there 's ought I can do , any little temp'ry embarrassment I can relieve , speak the word . For Hercules ' sake , I 'll be glad to serve you . " 54 THE SUN IS MY UNDOING Matthew was astonished . It struck him at once that here was a way at least out of present difficulties ; but he disliked the idea of taking this too smiling and plausible person into his full confidence . He laughed shortly , to gain time . " But this is monstrous amiable of you , Mr. Shergill ! Indeed , I 'm at a loss to know why you should be so accommodating . I warn you , there 's no security I can offer  --  " " Tt-tt-tt  --  no talk of security between friends . Now what do you want ? Fifty pounds ? A hundred ? I 've but a few guineas in my pocket at the moment , but you 're welcome to ' em . Later on we can get to- gether " Well , since you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , " lied Mat- thew , thinking rapidly , " and I was just cursing the necessity for tramping the long way back to Brandon Hill . " " Help yourself , " muttered the lawyer , holding out a handful of gold and silver under shadow of his coat-tails . With a murmur of thanks , Matthew did so , feeling that it was most extraordinary . In his experi- ence , lawyers did not supply , they fleeced one of money . It amused him to wonder what sort of reception he would have had from old Clay , the Flood attorney , if he had tried to borrow from him ! He could not avoid a feeling of uneasiness , as , having parted from Shergill , whose beams and winks and exaggerated courtesy of leave- taking seemed as absurd as they were uncalled for , he continued on his way . He hit back an exclamation of impatience at the sight , ahead of and walking toward him , of Ralph Burmester , who had just turned into the main street on his way from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible to escape reminders of the previous night . The tall , dignified figure , which , by displaying a black knot , re- minded Matthew that he had not yet paid this tribute of respect to the dead , was , however , difficult to associate with that sorry scene . Ralph Burmester gravely doffed his hat ; an expression of serious perturbation came into his face as he returned Matthew 's greeting . " I am sorry I was not at hand to lend you my assistance . " " You were well away , " muttered Matthew . He felt shamed , and resented it . Ralph Burmester appeared to hesitate . " My wife  --  " he began , and cleared his throat . " My wife , whom doubtless you remember , bids me offer you hospitality tonight . She thinks you may find it distressing , alone at Triton Lodge . " BRISTOL 55Matthew ignored the cold form of the invitation , and his face lightened . As always , he looked much younger when he smiled , and there was something that even Burmester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That is very kind of Mrs. Burmester ! Pray give her my compliments and say I am grateful to accept . How is she ? And the two little girls , Pally  --  was n't it  --  and Orry ? They will have forgotten their clumsy playmate . I suppose they are quite big by now . " " My daughter Pallas is twenty , " said Ralph Burmester stiffly . " And Orabella has just had her sixteenth birthday . " Matthew was startled into a laugh . " Lud , sir , but that puts a different complexion on the matter ! I fear I 'm not equipped to grace such society . Having left town somewhat hastily , I have with me only a meagre allowance of clean linen , and no sort of attire that is suitable for dining with ladies , " he declared . Ralph gave him a disapproving glance . " Your bereavement will absolve you , in their eyes , of fashionable adornment . We dine at six ; I shall be pleased to welcome you . " " Liar ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bows , the pair of them parted . " I 've made no favourable impression in that quarter , at any rate . I wonder if he 's friendly with Uncle Jason ? " The two families must have had some acquaintance in the old days , since he had been invited to play with the Burmester children . He remembered vaguely two pretty little girls , much younger than himself , with whom he was awkwardly shy  --  too conscious of the contrastbetween their fragile daintiness and his own hulking clumsiness of an overgrown schoolboy to join in the games into which they tried to draw him . He remembered that the elder  --  that would be Pallyhadcome to him one day with a little painted box in her hands . " There , Matthew , that is my new musical box ; it plays three tunes . I wo n't allow Orry to touch it , for , being only a baby , she might easily spoil it . But you are such a great boy , you would do it no harm , would you ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ con- , quered his shyness . Pally , so pretty , so serious , holding up her precious toy , brought the spontaneous smile to his sullen lips . The three tunes tinkled and the little girls danced , until , tiring of the thin , sweet music and the soft , unreal scene , delicate as a fan-painting on satin , and halfscaredby his own share in it , Matthew suddenly ground the handle so56 THE SUN IS MY UNDOINGfuriously and at such a speed that it broke off in his hand . Aghast at what he had done , at Orabella 's wail and Pally 's wide eyes and parted lips of dismay , he lost his head completely . Dashing the box down on the flagged floor of the hall , he fled . He was never asked to the house again . What a memory on which to renew an acquaintance ! To a young lady of twenty he stood preconvicted as a boor . That would take some living down  --  especially on the top of any gossip that might have reached her ears from London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ever the most sensitive of his emotions  --  pricked him , and , half seriously , half in jest , he began to cast about in his mind for some propitiatory offering that might cover the awkward moment of meeting . " By Christmas ! It is  --  can only be  --  Matthew Flood ! " The unseasonable oath , coupled with the unexpected utterance of his name , made Matthew spin on his heel . The person who accosted him was nearly as tall as himself , fully as broad , and wore about the lower part of a face nearly as dark as Africa 's a beard which flamed like an autumn bonfire in the midday sun . There was something so outlandish about that combination of fiery beard and skin of weather-blackened bronze that Matthew found himselfstaring ; it needed only the reek of tar and brine , and the wide , rolling gait that brought the stranger alongside like a barge settling athwart hawse of a privateer to identify him as a sailor . He held out a hand the size of a ham , tattooed so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance , the appearance of being mittened in blue and crimson , and brought the other down with a clap on Matthew 's shoulder that made the latter wince . " By Christmas ! It must be twelve year since we met ! But stab me if I 'm mistaken in them black brows of yours , that 's as good as a tradesman 's sign to anyone that seeks you . If ever you have need to hide , my cock , you must first shave off your brows ! " The speaker burst out laughing . His bob wig was pushed away to the back of his head and left exposed a brow beaded with sweat and divided by the line of the wig itself into two equal strips , the lower dark , like the remainder of his face , and the upper light and ruddy , in conformance with the colouring of his beard . The black brows drew together , for Matthew did not care to be taken at disadvantage . BRISTOL 57 " Then , " he retorted , " if it is twelve years since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that scrubbing mop that hides your lower face ! And if you wish me to recognize you , you must either visit a barber or give me your name . " " Abiathar Crown  --  damn your eyes ! I was the dunce and you the bright boy at Redcliffe Grammar , and you got the prizes , and I the punches , " amplified the other , evidently in no way embittered by the reminiscence . CHAPTER V I uO THEY turned you out of the company ! " As Matthew evinced surprise at Crown 's knowledge of his affairs , the latter chuckled , " And a good job for you , I 'll be bound . I can think of less tejious jobs than selling timber . " He gave a prodigious wink , which , owing to the lightness of his eyes , reminded Matthew of the blink of a watchman 's lantern on a windy night . " You 've got a fine , prosperous look about you ! More power to you . I take it you 've made your fortune in London . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indefinitely the pretencethat he was a person of affluence , and there was something that invited confidence in the honest naivete of Crown , who stood nodding his head in amiable envy of his schoolfellow 's success . " What about yourself ? I see you 've taken to the water . Well , how does the life of a shipmaster please you ? " He imagined he was paying a compliment , for it did not look as though Crown had risen to the command of a ship . Although he was not in the casual rig of a commonsailor , his appearance was rough , even shabby . He wore an old blue , full-bottomed coat , faded and weather-streaked ; his small-clothes. were deplorable  --  a mass of stains and grease-spots , with a cobbled darn showing on the inside of a knee ; his waistcoat was of poor material , . threadbare in places , and lacked many buttons , and his coarse woollen stockings were wrinkled over clownish shoes of unpolished leather .. Conscious of inspection , Crown shrugged a shoulder , as though to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a fair index to my condition , " he admitted , not , Matthewnoticed , denying the suggestion that he was a shipmaster . " I grant you , it 's worse than it need be ; the slut I live with , though she 'll cook and bake for me at any hour of the day or night , avoids like poison58BRISTOL 59laying hand to a needle . A master 's job is like others : good when you 're with the right people , and plaguy bad when luck 's against you . " " Where can we drink ? " asked Matthew . He was tired of the amount of interest his appearance aroused and a little ashamed of his shabby companion . They had arrived at the harbour , and here the river revealeditself as the life-impulse of the town , for it seemed as though at least two-thirds of the population were gathered between the sheds and the edge of the quays . Sober , well-dressed merchants , attended by their factors , rubbed shoulders with the less respectable personnel of the seaways , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down their noses at the merchant skippers , whose shore-going kit , in many instances , gave mildewed evidence of long disuse . The noise was deafening . Fishwives cried their ware in voices more cracked and raucous than any man 's ; a babel of foreign tongues strivingagainst West Country accents increased confusion among the labourers who struggled with the cargoes , with handkerchiefs knotted round their brows and others supporting the breeches about their sweatinghips . Although it was the month of November , it was mild , humid weather ; the midday sun that penetrated the almost imperceptible mist still had power to scorch the imperturbable mariners of the small river craft , who , anchored , seemingly , like the craft , to their bollards , added another layer to the brown lacquer that covered all the exposed parts of their flesh . There was a continual splatting of bare feet , plunging of hoofs on cobbles worn to glass ; a pedlar hawked brass rings along the waterfront that the artless seamen of the lower decks bought as " fine gold " and paid for accordingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-to-do-seeming landsmen . Some shabby employee of the theatre thrust into Matthew 's hand a bill promising " a moonlight night and a Stupendous Galaxy of Talent at Jacob 's Well ! " A group of itinerant acrobats enterprisingly staged on the spot a performance for the amusement of the crew of a cargo boat newly arrived from Lisbon , seemingly unperturbed by the constant interruptionof their act by vehicles whose swearing drivers cut at the tumblers with their whips . Matthew and Abiathar stood for a few momentslooking on , Matthew half scornful yet amused against his will by the ingenious performance . He had almost forgotten this aspect of Bristol , which had delighted him as a child . Abiathar nudged his elbow , to draw his attention to a sorry proces-6o THE SUN IS MY UNDOINGSion of black figures that , newly risen from the bowels of the vessel that brought them , lurched as though blind and drunk , their limbs seeminglytoo weak to support the chain that linked them together . Although there was no recognized slave-market in Bristol , it was common for a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee houses or taverns where the young bloods congregated for the pleasure and distinction of securing a black servant , who , in nine cases out of ten , lived but a few months in that unaccustomed climate ; and if a young female should happen to be included in the sale , the bidding waxed fast and furious , the ribaldry not less so , and the winner of this delectable prize was mightily chaffed by his envious companions . Matthew felt an itching to go along and see the fun , but Abiathar was beckoning him into one of the taverns of the waterfront , where they were greeted by a thin , hard-bitten fellow with a scar at the corner of his eye , whom Matthew introduced as Captain Carfrew . This person , considerably better caparisoned than his colleague , had plenty to say about the pirates to whose attentions he owed the fact that he was shore-bound . " By Jesus , one needs to be fitted like a Line-o ' - hattle ship these days , with the riffraff that 's on the high seas ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the better for all of us ; for maybe then their lordships 'll find time to send out an expedition to blow them plundering Turks and Moors to perdition , instead of spending the country 's money in ransomsfor their victims . " He blew the froth off his tankard before continuing , Abiathar being preoccupied with the landlord . " There goes one of the finest fellows that ever took a ship across the Atlantic ! " Matthew was surprised . The seedy , half-stupid appearance of Abiatharhad led him privately to the conclusion that the latter was probablyhimself to blame for his melancholy situation . " There 's no man living who knows more than him about the handlingof niggers ; it 's a kind of genius , " Carfrew was muttering . " ' T was a flaming scandal the way he was used at Liverpool by them tight-fisted skinflints that blames everything but their own flaming stinginess for the way things went . Look ' ee here , Mr. What's-yer-name "  --  he shook an admonitory finger at Matthew  --  " if ever you take to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : trust your skipper . He 'll know a flaming sight more about it than you ever will if you live to be a hundred . " Matthew could not help laughing at this serious warning . " With all due respect to you , and thanks for the advice , I can thinkBRISTOL 61of nothing less likely than that I shall ever find myself in a position to interest myself in the slave-trade , " he said with assumed carelessness . The captain shook his head . " It 's surely a pity , for there 's still a fortune to be had out of it . I 've clone little myself , for I 've been with the privateers . Still , you never can tell ! " He jerked up his elbow , to toast the imponderable future . II " I been up at Liverpool ten year or more , " Abiathar explained when Carfrew left them together . " A fellow I met offered me his snow Elizabethfor the Guinea trip , and better money than I could get just then in Bristol . Well  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than your due ... . " We lost her to the Portugee and I thought myself lucky to get back to Liverpool . It was reg'lar sailing for a bit , but them Mersey screws , they 'd pinch farthings out o ' the poorbox ! " " Aye , they 're close-fisted in Lancashire . " Matthew spoke out of the depths of his own experience . " Close-fisted ? They leave you to pay your own port charges an ' primage , out o ' fi ' pun ' a month ! What do you say to that ? And a poorer , wretcheder lot than them Mersey skippers , poor devils , I hope never to see . Never so much as a glass o ' Madeiry ashore , but salt beef an ' biscuits aboard , even in the home port . " " Five pounds a month  --  is that all the pay you got ? " asked Matthewwith the contempt he always felt for those who accepted such pittances . " I was to have six pun ' out of every hundred , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bendeineer ; a fine , smart brig she was , straight out of the shipyard . It was her maiden voyage , and we should ha ' done well  --  pickin ' up three hundred prime niggers at Bonny " Matthew 's interest quickened . Many a time he had wished he could raise the capital to put into one of the slaving-vessels that plied between Bristol and the Guinea coast . He knew his grandfather had had shares in them , and stories were rife of the fantastic fortunes that had been made out of the first nine years of open trade , when the merchants of Bristol and Liverpool dispatched , between them , no less than a hundred and seventy thousand Negroes to English plantations . " Aye , it should ha ' turned out well , " Abiathar was saying mourn-62 THE SUN IS MY UNDOINGfully , " but luck was against us . Three parts went sick o ' the flux and could n't pass the surgeon , an ' the rest , all but a miserable score , we put overboard for fear of infection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as you keep your cargo healthy ; but once start flux , or that infernalblindness that spreads like wildfire when you get it aboard , and your profits are gone before you 've started to count ' em . " " Risky business , " commented Matthew . Crown pounced on the words before they were out of his mouth . " Risky ? Where 's the risk , so long as you 're properly fitted ? The owners know it 's to their interests to preserve the condition of the cargo , and , compared with common transport , it 's lodging for lords ! You never seen ' cm throwing the corpses over off Rotterdam , have you ? That 's common transport , that 's accounted for two thousand unlucky devils , and maybe more , in the last five years  --  out o ' Dutch ships alone . And , mind you , Dutch transport 's better than ours . Ask me if I 'd sooner take a trip by transport or in a slaver and I 'll answer you straight : give me a slaver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily , all the same , on that trip of yours . " " And who 's to blame ? " Crown brought his great blue and crimson fist clown savagely on the table . " I 've brought back slaves , and not a manjack among ' em changed hands for less than twenty pun ' when we got to the Indies . But there was we , short of saltpetre and sarsaprilly and all the stuff that 's needed to keep a ship sweet an ' wholesome . I ' 11 not be responsible , ' I told ' em  --  an ' they laughed in my face . What 's it mean to them , but a bottle less o ' wine for some Liverpool gentleman swigging in his mansion ? For me it was plain starvation . I 'm off back to Bristol , ' I said , where they pays you a living wage  --  besides grantingprivileges that tots up nicely on the skipper 's balance . No shoving your hand in your breeches , ' I says , each time you puts into harbour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " interrupted Matthew , " on an average healthy cargo ? " " Well , nat'rally , it varies . The last trip I took here , out o ' Bristol  --  I was mate in them clays  --  we delivered four hundred slaves , all but a score in prime condition . The lot was sold from thirty shillings to fifteenpun ' apiece  --  according , you see , as whether they was male or female , youngsters or full-grown . Then we 'd got teeth and logwood and muscovado we brought back with us , and some of the stuff we took out for trading , that was nipped up fast when we was lying off the islands . BRISTOL 63We sailed worth something like seventeen thousand pounds , and I reckon the owners must ha ' drawn a clear twenty thousand from the trip . " Matthew drew a whistling breath through his teeth . " After paying off the charges ? No wonder they say slaving pays . " " Aye , but mark you , " said Abiathar Crown , " the best days are over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London 's trade , but the Mersey rats 'll beat us in the end . For all that  --  by Christmas , I 'd sooner go lean under Bristol owners than wax fat in Liverpool service . " " Whom are you sailing for now ? " " Nobody , " confessed Abiathar . " I been back but three or four months , mind you , and I hit a bad time . I made sure , when leaving Liverpool , I 'd ha ' got a ship right away . But all this privateering has hit the owners ; there 's actually fewer ships afloat than there was before the wars , and them as has ' em sticks to ' em . Small blame either . I 've not had the smell of a ship since I come home . " " Have you a family ? " " Now that , as you might say , ' s a matter of argyment , " Abiathar observedwith engaging candour . " A sailor 's life , as you know , ' s a rovingone ; and there might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got claims on me . Not that it matters . An empty purse solves a deal of awk'ard situations . " Matthew threw back his head and roared with laughter . " That 's one way of looking at it ! It creates ' em as well , I might remind you . I should know  --  " He broke off , determined not to let his tongue wag too freely until he had taken the full measure of his companion'sdiscretion . " Ah , you 're one of the lucky ones ; it needs but a look at you to see that , " Abiathar was saying simply . " Well , well , to them as has , more shall be given ; and if you got precious little of your own , the next best is to rejoice with your more fort'nate fellows . " Again he gave his ponderouswink , in which he included not only Matthew , but all of the company within earshot . " What the devil do you mean ? " The tone brought Abiathar up short , and drew from him a clumsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mind . Out with it ! " " ' T is naught but hearsay , " mumbled Abiathar . Glancing uneasily over his shoulder , as Shergill had done , he moved closer to mutter , 64 THE SUN IS MY UNDOING " There 's a Bible-full o ' yarns around the town this morning , as you can guess without me telling you ; but if you 've done your uncle Jason out of some of his expectations , there 's few in Bristol as wo n't wish you well . " " If that 's the gossip , " said Matthew bitterly , " you need pay no attention to it . I 've known these ten years that my name does n't figure in my grandfather 's will  --  more 's the pity ; and such hopes as I had of making a little capital out of our renewed acquaintance perished last night , in circumstances that concern no one but myself . " He spoke roughly , arrogantly , for the benefit of any who might be listening . So that 's what Bristol was saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The thought flashed across his mind that this rumour might account for Shergill 's inexplicable generosity , but it seemed little likely that he , an intimate friend of Hercules , would lend ear to the canard . Or was it that Shergill knew something ? His heart nearly stopped at the thought . Hercules had always stoutly refused to combine business with friendship , and his relations with Clay , the family lawyer , were of the most formal . He had never employed Shergill in his professional capacity , but was it not at least possible that he might have dropped some hint about his dealings with Clay ? A sudden burst of candour , with which excitement was mingled , made him lean across the table to slap his companion 's shoulder . " I 'm glad Bristol 's so well disposed to me , ' Biathar ! I may need to call on its benevolence before long ! " He laughed as he beckoned the potboy and ordered more ale . " Shall I tell you what brings me back  --  to a town I 'd thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ III .. You 're wanted  --  for debt ? " said Abiathar stupidly at the end of Matthew 's recital . " My tailor , my bootmaker , my mercer , the fellow who supplies my wines , and a shopkeeper of whom , from time to time , I have purchased some trifles necessary to the equipment of a man of fashion are but a few of the people who in the last week or two have served writs upon me  --  which I 've chosen this means of evading . " Matthew airily lifted his glass ; he had rather enjoyed the narrative , to which he had added some touches , and omitted others , at the dictates of a not unworthy taste for drama . BRISTOL 65 " What trade do you follow ? " asked Abiathar , obviously impressed by this eclectic performance . Matthew hedged . " I buy and I sell . I have interests in the city , and some share , no doubt , of the commercial wit of my forefathers has enabled me to supportmyself up to now without calling upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even put in these flowery terms , lacked grandiloquence . He frowned as he concluded , " So you see , we are both in the same boat . In fact , I 'll wager there is not a penny more in my pocket at the present moment than there is in yours . " He had forgotten the guineas he had " borrowed " from Shergill , so when Abiathar rose to the challenge and flung a handful of small change on the table , Matthew , following suit , was a little taken aback to see gold among the coins he tossed out of his own pockets . " ' T is a pity I did n't take your wager , " said Abiathar grimly . It was evident his belief in Matthew was shaken as he scowled across the burning forest of his beard . " I 'd dice you for the lot , " said Matthew ruefully , " if I could afford to lose it . But I 'm in a deuced tricky situation , and I 'm not fool enough to look to my uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never had use for Methodees , " agreed Abiathar as he scooped his few shillings into his pocket . " I 'll never have one of ' em aboard if I know it . ' T is Methodees and Quakers that 's raising all this stink around slave-trading  --  taking the bread out o ' mouths more honest than their own , and betraying the very town that gives ' em their victuals . Yet ' t was a Methodee as did this ornament , and a finer piece of work I never seen , betwixt here and the Caribbees . " He clenched his fist and presented the back of it to Matthew , who had now the opportunity of examining at close quarters its singular ornament . The pattern , like chainmail or the fine scales of fish , ran from half-way up the forearm to the base of the fingers , and , superimposedupon it , crimson on blue , was a nobly executed mermaid , circularbreasts , snake-like curls , curving tail , mirror , and all , her starrayedeyes staring out of her plump , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Woman in the Net , ' I call her , " said Abiathar proudly , " and there was to have been a man-mermaid on the other hand to keep her company ; but , as luck had it , the fellow that was doing them got drunk on the money I paid him for the female , and got himself into jail , and66 THE SUN IS MY UNDOING BRISTOL 67we sailed before they let him out . ' T was a'pity , for I never laid eyes on him since , and I never found anyone that could copy it . " " It 's a handsome piece of work , " agreed Matthew , setting down his empty glass . He had had enough of Abiathar and enough of the port ; he would go up to Brandon Hill , eat , and make up for the lost sleep of the previous night , while Africa set in better order his clothes , which still showed signs of his long journey . It was mortifying not to be able to cut a finer figure at the Burmesters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroll around the docks with me . There 's some noble shipping in . " The wistfulness and lack of occupationof the shore-stranded sailor sounded plainly in Abiathar 's tone . " Indeed , " he went on , " if I had but money to venture , I could be afloat this very day . But there  --  I was never prudent in money fashions , and I suppose folk 'd say I wasted my substance in riotous living ! " " Could you not borrow ? " " To borrow needs security ; and the security I have to offer is n't to be wrote down on parchment and locked up in strongboxes . " " What is it ? " " Knowledge , " said Abiathar simply . " What 's here inside "  --  he pointed to his head  --  " is worth gold to the owners , if they but knew ; but how should they ? You know I 'm a dunce ; I can write just enough to keep the log in a style of my own ; I have no fine , slippery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen me handling my ship in a gale or dealing with a cargo of blacks  --  I do n't say there is n't dozens like me , and better ; but I 've been away so long , I 've dropped from folks ' minds , and , as you see , my looks are n't in my favour . " " I shall see if anything can be done for you , " said Matthew uneasily . The friendly scepticism in Abiathar 's eye stung him with the reminder that he , a Flood , could exert practically no influence in his native town . Here , in this busy centre of commercial prosperity , of solid reputations and close-woven civic interests , he was as insignificant as he had been in the London circles he had foolishly aspired to conquer . He felt angry , defeated , and helpless , like a fly in a web ; his anger made his bearing more insolent ; he hated the calm , settled security he noted in men of little more than his own age , their indifferent or curiousstares , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks made a foreigner of him . A tearing envy of these self-satisfied provincialswrenched at his bowels , an envy which , although masquerading as contempt , poisoned him with its sourness . It had reached its apotheosisby the time he arrived at the gates and strode up the broad and stately , although untended , drive that brought him to the front of TritonLodge . This was the house that Jason stood to inherit , to which he would remove his family and his household possessions as soon as the will was read ! " Unless he sells it , " thought Matthew . Of the two alternatives , he felt the latter was preferable . To keep up such a place demanded a certain quality ; it was impossible to visualize Ann Flood , with her cheese-paring economies , her starve-crow notions of hospitality , her doleful attire , and her two drab , unaccomplished daughters , in such a setting . Floods  --  Matthew knew at least so much of his forebears  --  had been famous for their generosities , for their lavish entertainings , even for a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shamed their social superiors . A passion of resentment seized and shook Matthew as he stood upon the carriage sweep , looking up at the once more shuttered windows , at the hatchment which , since his absence , had made its gloomy appearanceabove the porch . He could so clearly picture himself established there , with all the retinue that wealth can command , carrying on his grandfather 's tradition , receiving his friends from London  --  how they would scandalize the Bristolians !  --  and meeting , on terms of contemptuousequality ( the contempt , of course , was to be his , not theirs ) , the surrounding gentry , who came prepared to patronize the merchant'sgrandson . Supposing Hercules had relented to the extent of making some provisionfor his future  --  a possibility too faint , so far , to be seriously entertained  --  themost he could expect would be the crumbs from Jason 's table . It was hard to know whether to be relieved or mortified by the prospect . So long as it did not come to him through Jason 's grudging hands ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity if there was any truth in the rumour of which Abiathar had spoken came sharply to his mind . If there was hope of legacy , howeversmall , one might at least obtain advances that would enable one to face one 's creditors , upon their inevitable arrival , with a confidence at present sadly lacking . The house , when he entered , was very silent . In one of the upper rooms , to which it had been removed from its lamentable surroundings , lay the empty shell of Hercules Flood , white-shrouded , waiting for the great coffin of oak which would arrive in the morning . Dusk had fallen ; 68 THE SUN IS MY UNDOINGa creeping chill , itself suggestive of death , invaded the empty and silent rooms , of which all the doors stood open as though to emphasize their emptiness . By Ann Flood 's orders , no fires were lighted , and from the fireless hearths the dogs , companions of Hercules ' solitude , had stolen away to warmer quarters . The scared servants , huddled beyond the swing doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , seemed to have fallen under the prevalent hush that death had brought within the walls . Matthew shivered . He was grateful to Lydia Burmester for offering him a means of temporary escape from these melancholy and grim surroundings . CHAPTER VIIHAVE asked young Flood to dine with us . " " It was kind of you to remember . " " I should be much obliged if you would keep your eye on Orabella . She means no harm , but there is sometimes a levity in her conversation that is liable to be misunderstood  --  especially by people less innocent than herself . " " Oh , Matthew is hardly likely to misunderstand . Did they not play together as children ? " " A good deal of water has flowed under the bridges since those days , my dear . To speak candidly , had it not been for your importunacy , I would rather not have introduced that young man into our household . " " But , dear heart , what harm can he do ? Poor lad , I think it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his behaviour , " said Lydia . " No child had ever a more unfortunate upbringing  --  I am sure those Flood girls are hardly human , poor things  --  and how much worse must such a system of rearing be for a boy ? " " If I bow to your superior knowledge in all that concerns your sex , you must leave me to be the best judge of mine . I say , it is a bad type , and I would rather see either of my children dead than married to such a one . , " Merciful heaven , who ever thought of such a thing ? Pallas , you know , is almost indecently indifferent to men ! And Matthew is far too old for Orry , who only cares for people of her own age . As for men being the best judges of their own sex , ' t would be unbecoming of me to contradict you outright , yet I can not help observing that men are often quite as unjust with one another as women . Pray , dear Ralph , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard from Jason Flood , who may be an estimable person but is surely the most prejudiced , unpleasantman in Bristol ! " 6970 THE SUN IS MY UNDOING " At the same time , it is impossible not to respect him for a man indomitablytrue to his own principles . I would not , for a thousand pounds , have offered him such an affront as last night 's affair , and I , for one , heartily regret my share in it . " " ' T was a sad , unfortunate business , and I am sure that all must feel as you do . " The slow , sedative syllables fell quietly upon his vexation , and Ralph felt , as he often did , that Lydia regarded him as much her son as her husband . " But you were not to blame , and if the responsibilityis Matthew 's I pity him . " " You would perhaps reserve your pity if you had met him this morningswaggering in the town ; a travelling showman would have made no less advertisement of his personality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not help being interested in the boy , for I was very fond of his father . " She lifted her head , to look at him with limpid candour . " You do not mind my being fond of James ? Because I always think there is something poor about a woman who is not loyal to her first love . " " Knowing how well they have served me , I would not for the world disturb your loyalties . " Ralph spoke tenderly , touched , as he invariably was , by her confidence in him . " Is it not time you were dressing , my love ? Your invariable lateness is but another of your charms ! But I should be truly grateful if you would endeavour to be punctual on this occasion . " " I will  --  I will . But if it is to look after Pallas and Orry , I am sure you are a much more efficient chaperon than I. I am so apt to forget everythingabout the children except how beautiful they are , " she confessed , turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they inherited their beauty . Ralph cleared his throat . " I have a particular reason  --  " he told her , and paused . " John Peddy spoke to me this morning " Yes ? " she encouraged him . " This can not go on for ever ! She must make up her mind . " " She ? You mean Pally ? " said Lydia calmly . " For the last five years there seems to have been nothing but a procession of young fellows asking my permission to pay their addresses to my eldest daughter ! The thing is getting absurd . " Ralph laughed uneasily . " Indeed , I am determined to put a stop to it . Apart from theBRISTOL 71fact that it 's hardly seemly she should play fast and loose with all her admirers . " " Dear heart , how unlike Pally ! You know she would not willingly hurt a fly ! And ' t is hardly her fault if the young men get emotional about her . I am sure you ca n't accuse her of encouraging them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , " Ralph interruptedher . " I have none . I have always intended that one of my sonsin-lawshould fill their place . Peddy and I have come to an agreement over Sam , who is to be taken into my business . " " As Pally 's husband ? " Lydia sat very still , her hands folded on her knee . " That is included in the agreement . Sam is an excellent fellow and will make her a good husband . " " Have you told Pally ? " " I am just about to do so . I sent a message to her as I came in . I had not intended to do it so abruptly , but the current of events has forced my hand . I am not inclined , " said Ralph , tightening his jaw , " to place two daughters at the disposal of an adventurer ; and if Matthew Flood intends to prolong his stay in Bristol , I think you had better send Orabellato visit her cousins until he has returned to town . " " Ralph , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Mat-thew . " " I know his kind . I marked his look when I spoke of the girls . To a man of his sort every woman is fair game . I 'll have him flogged out of Bristol if he starts anything with either of my daughters ! " " And so poor Pally is to be betrothed to Sam Peddy ! " She spoke whimsically ; one would have said that , to her , her daughter 's betrothal was a matter of indifference . Ralph , although he knew this pose of hers , could not refrain from flinging at her a glance of intense exasperation . " She likes him enough  --  surely ? " " She likes him , as she likes Orabella 's kitten , and my macaw , and her tapestry frame : is that enough ? Forgive me ! I did not mean to tease , and I sometimes feel I owe you an apology for giving you so provokinga daughter . What 's in a name ? ' Perhaps I chose imprudently , being so tired of the Anns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born . She is not cold  --  indeed , she is more deeply loving than Orry , whose affections swing about like the weathercock ; 72 THE SUN IS MY UNDOINGbut  --  I hardly know how to put it . All her profounder passions seem to be reserved for abstract subjects , for ideas that hardly seem becomingto a woman , let alone a girl just come to her twenties ! She is always wanting to change the accepted order of things : she questions matters that most people take for granted  --  " " Which all proves she will be better married . A house to look after and a pregnancy or two will soon alter her outlook . " Lydia drooped her head . " I hope you arc right . And I hope you will be successful with Pally . " " There 's not , I suppose , any question of a prior attachment ? " Ralph turned sharply at the door . Their eyes met , hers wide with bewilderment . " I have no wish to force her against her will , but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t is high time to put a stop to them . If they are designed to provoke some favoured swain , to whom she has given her heart in secret , the game 's gone on long enough . " " Pally is no coquette ; she is too kind and too sincere , and you know she is as open as the day ! I am sure she has no secret lover  --  how should she ? She meets only our own friends and their young people . " " All right  --  all right ; pray , my love , get dressed , " said Ralph with the slight inclination to testiness that was among his few signs of advancingyears . " It may be that my conversation with Pallas will detain me , and I should dislike young Flood to find no one to receive him . " " I will be ready instantly , " promised Lydia ; it was perhaps some doubt of her ability to fulfil her promise that made her add , " Could you , perhaps  --  in case of accident , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the best intention in the world , over dressing !  --  could you postpone your talk with Pally ? There is surely no particular haste ? " " Allow me to he the best judge of that . " Ralph 's eyes had narrowed and his lower lip had the obstinate thrust against which , she knew , all pleadings were vain . " I saw john Peddy this afternoon , and gave him my word I would speak to Pallas straightaway . If I put an extreme interpretation on my promise , it is  --  you may as well know it is  --  that I have here "  --  he tapped his heart  --  " a warning that previous experience has taught me better than to disregard . I do not believe that Matthew Flood 's return to Bristol bodes well  --  for himself or for those who have dealings with him . In my own household , at least , I can protect my interests and the interests of those dependent on me . " " Are you trying to alarm me ? " Lydia asked calmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarmed about . I am offering you aBRISTOL 73warning , not to be led by your tenderer sentiments into a lesser degree of attention to your maternal duties than you would feel bound to pay if it were a stranger , instead of Matthew Flood , who was dining with us tonight . Pray , my dear wife , disabuse your mind of the picture of a loutish lad , misunderstood and misinterpreted , which seems to have survived the past ten years ! "  --  with which Parthian shot , Ralph left his wife to proceed with her dressing . As she pulled on the bell-cord for Betty , Lydia  --  sagacious being !  --  wondered whether she had imposed too hard a test upon her husband 's generosity by recalling to his memorythe origin of her goodwill toward Matthew Flood . IIThe calm , candlelit room , with its panelling of hedge-sparrow-egg blue , its doubtful  --  but charming  --  Canaletto over the mantelpiece , and its suave , rose-fanee draperies , which made of each long window a miniature proscenium , took Matthew by surprise when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not prepared him for such a scene ; he had vague recollections of parlours filled with a jumble of objects whose owners ' taste , incapable of distinguishing betweengood and bad , bathed in an equal glow of proud possession each varied item . A tea-service of local porcelain of a fineness connoisseurs might envy was flanked by the vulgar foreign knick-knacks that were the vogue in decoration  --  plaster figures , carved ivories whose value lay only in their intricate craftsmanship , atrocities in Italian mosaic and coral  --  brought proudly home by the merchant skippers whose wives , no less proudly , hastened to display them to their full and horrible advantage . A fireplace by Grinling Gibbons relinquished its character to the plethora of vast , painted urns , of gilded clocks and simpering Sevres figurines that loaded its mantelshelf . Bristol opulence lent itself to these outrages ; unlike its neighbour , Bath , it lacked the traditions of aristocracy to check its ebullience of possession  --  which Matthew himself had only come to recognize , and despise , since his sojourn in town . He therefore looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his surroundings . If Bristol trade could produce a setting like this , had he not been a fool , and worse than a fool , to reject its possibilities ? This , or maybe better  --  Matthew was never one to underrate his own qualities  --  waswhat he had relinquished for the sake of a dubious life of adventure . If he had been content to follow the family calling . . . He74 THE SUN IS MY UNDOINGpulled his thoughts up with a jerk . What ? To have remained a Bristol bumpkin ? He laughed , spreading his hands to the blaze illuminating the wide , hospitable hearth , to which a long-haired kitten , snoozing in a basket , contributed a touch of domesticity . The rustle of a curtain and the faint jingle of rings along a rod brought him round quickly , to face a figure which , with the neatness and completeness of a stage performer , slipped through the opening of the curtains which masked one of the window embrasures . It was a small figure , in a spreading pink silk sacque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pair of immature breasts on which Matthew 's eyes rested for an appreciative second before he transferred their gaze to the parted lips that revealed a certain degree of excitement and apprehension very gratifying to the person responsible for their expression . " So you 've come back ! Just a moment  --  pray tell me if this is correct ! " The pink sacque crackled , bent , ballooned outward with its wearer 's curtsy , which carried her down to the polished boards and shook the bright rain of curls across her knee . " Is that correct ? " repeated Orabellaas she rose , looking anxiously for his approval . " ' T was a perfect performance , " declared Matthew , finishing his bow , which he executed in the military style , having always disliked the drawing-room fashion of " making a leg . " " And I suppose you are Miss Orabella ? We should hardly have known each other , should we , without this introduction ? " What a fascinating creature ! he was thinking , though comical in her provincial travesty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself with such abandon to the curtsy  --  save to the prejudice of her gown . It was the heyday of powder , and curtsies had changed from lithe collapse into unlimited upholstery to the poker-backed inclination enforced by the mode . " You must pardon us that there is nobody but me to receive you , " went on Orabella , " for Mamma is still dressing and Papa has had Pally in his room for more than half an hour , and must be reading her a lecture ; I listened as long as I dared , but they both mumble so ! ' T was too provoking . I am the curiousest creature in the world , and ca n't abide secrets , can you ? " " I like to share them , " smiled Matthew , amused by her frank survey of his person . " La , how you 've grown ! To tell the truth , I remembered you butBRISTOL 75faintly  --  after all , I was but a little girl , was I not ?  --  and you never took much notice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for such boorishness now ; though I expect you are sated with masculine attentions , Miss Orry , and a newcomercan have little chance of compelling your regard . " A suspected flavour of mockery in the compliment made Orabella frown . She walked primly across the room , to seat herself in one of the chairs whose broad arms clasped her voluminous flounces . Her toes barely touching the ground , her ankles crossed , she reminded Matthew of a lovely puppet he had once seen in a fair . He had come near to falling in love with the thing , which so fascinated him that over and over again he visited the spectacle in which it appeared ! The exquisite fragility , the enchanting , childlike gaucherie of the thin arms were also Orabella 's . He reflected that a flirtation would be very agreeable pour passer le temps and help to lift the sombreness that darkened these anxious days of waiting . " If you care for secrets , " said Orabella , her ear obviously cocked toward the door , " I will present you with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papa you 've seen me , when he arrives ! " " But if he finds us together ? " Matthew was tickled at this invitation to complicity . " He wo n't , " said Orabella promptly . " As soon as his step sounds in the hall , I shall be out through that further door in a flash , and I shall never forgive you if you betray me ! " " God forbid I should ever betray a woman ! " said Matthew with solemnity . " But explain : what hangs on it ? What do you stand to lose  --  your character , or something you value more highly !  --  if we are caught in conversation ? " " ' T is all too tedious to explain , " pouted Orabella . " But ' t is a fancy of Papa 's to regard me as an irresponsible infant , whereas , as you see  --  " She spread her hands in a gesture so naively coquettish that Matthew was enchanted . " ' T is obvious , " he observed gravely , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He perceived from the twinkle in her eye that she had a taste for irony more uncommon in her sex in those days even than it is in ours . " Ah , wait till you have seen my aged spinster sister Pally , " she admonishedhim . " Poor Pally ! I often think it is a perfect tragedy that76 THE SUN IS MY UNDOINGnever a man will look at her , for I 'm sure she 's got the sweetest nature in the world . " Little minx ! thought Matthew . Still , it was perhaps as well that one of the Burmester sisters should not be as seductive as this blond witch who blinked her blue eyes at him across the room . A double-barrelled flirtation could be exciting on occasion , but at the moment it was a little more than he could manage . The effects of his ride from London were still with him ; he felt out of condition and slack for want of sleep . He was apprehensive of the consequences of heat and the wine he would undoubtedly consume in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think a squint is so very revolting , do you ? " Orabella was solemnly inquiring . " Indeed , it can be most attractive . There is somethingpositively appealing , to my mind , about Pally when her right eye looks you straight in the face while the other is just a bit  --  just the least bit in life , mind you  --  rolled into its corner . Such eyes , too ! La , I 'd give the world for them  --  at least , for a matching pair , made to either model . Each one quite perfect in its way Matthew fixed a severe glance on her , beginning to suspect that Miss Orabella was wilfully exaggerating her sister 's infirmities . At all events , she was a cattish little thing , though none the less attractive for that , All women were feline , in Matthew 's experience , and monstrously unfair to their own sex . But Orabella returned his gaze with limpid assuranceas she continued . " And , of course , ' t was after you went away she had her accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  la , what a scene ! She does n't use her crutches any longer , but ' t was ruin to her figure . All those broken bones , you know  --  a horrifying affair ; ' t is a miracle she escaped as she ( lid . And of course , we do n't notice the limp ; I expect ' twill strike you shocking , but please conceal it the best you can , becausepoor Pally is so very sensitive about her appearance . " Cross-eyed and lame ! No wonder , poor creature , beside this radiant being . Matthew felt the spasm of pity and disgust which he always experiencedwhen faced with physical abnormalities . The prospect of having to spend the evening in the company of one who roused in him that always unwelcome sense of compassion was not lightened by the necessity of having , at least outwardly , to modify his expressions of admiration toward her sister . One could not , for humanity 's sake , ogle the one and ignore the other . " There 's Papa ! " gasped Orabella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room , as she had promised , " in a flash , " only pausing at the door to whisper , with uplifted finger and eyes dancing with  --  as Matthew assumed  --  the excitement of conspiracy , " And remember ! I rely on you to be the soul of kindness to my poor sister Pally ! " Ralph Burmester entered , excusing himself for his tardiness . His face wore a vexed , abstracted look that made Matthew wonder what accounted for the delay as he glanced round the room for his wife . His eyebrows rode upward . Of course . He might have known better than trust to Lydia . " Will you drink sherry ? The ladies will be with us shortly . " " One would willingly wait  --  if need be , for ever  --  in prospect of such a treat ! " The meaningless compliment , echoing hollowly in its sober surroundings , was not a success . Ralph 's face was immovable as he crossed the room to pour out the wine . " It is not our custom , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , as though he rejected Matthew 's disclaimer . Looking across his shoulder , Matthew observed that the door through which Orabella had made her escape stood slightly ajar , and , guessing correctlythat she was waiting behind it , raised his voice to reply . " On the contrary , I have had plenty of entertainment "  --  he paused deliberately ; did the door-handle tremble ?  --  " in admiring your art collection , sir ! Is that not a Guardi , above the cabinet ? I see you are an amateur of pictures . " It was characteristic of Matthew to present his superficial knowledge to the best advantage ; it was by the merest chance that he had identified the Guardi  --  among his various ventures having been that of art dealer , in which he succeeded , as might be said of many in the present day , largely by lack of principle . " I know nothing of art , " Ralph , to Matthew 's relief , returned bluntly . " I buy a picture when I like it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school means little to me . " He paused as though seeking a more congenial topic of conversation , and evidently did not find one , for he jerked at Matthew abruptly , " I suppose the funeral arrangements have now been made ? " " Lud , I suppose so , " rejoined Matthew with the distaste he always felt for the intrusion of dull or unaesthetic topics on a social occasion . Grimacing at provincial boorishness , he added , " As you may imagine , I am the last to be consulted ! But I take it Uncle Jason has the matter in hand . " " I shall ever have it on my mind , " said Ralph heavily , " that I was78 THE SUN IS MY UNDOING instrumental in bringing about the death of an old friend , to whom I owe more than can readily be computed . " " You reproach yourself unduly , " said Matthew with a curious touch of Hercules ' dignity that was not lost on his companion . " If anyone is to blame , it is myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ af- fair . Egad ! If you had to die , which would you choose  --  to flicker out mournfully , like a corpse-candle , to the tune of prayers , or to blaze to glory , as Grandfather did , on some supreme moment of satisfaction ? " " There is no point in discussing it ; the thing is done , and I bitterly regret my share in it . " " Be as melancholy about it as you like . " Matthew 's impatience got the better of his courtesy . " I too loved my grandfather , and owed him - certain things . Well  --  I killed him , if you choose to put it that way : I am not one to shirk plain speaking . I killed him at a moment when his life was much more valuable to me than his death . " " That I can well believe ! " Ralph retorted icily . " Go on believing it , for if , as the tale seems to go , I inherit so much as a brass farthing , there wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ' t was in view of that I tumbled the old fellow into eternity . " He spoke brutally , recklessly , because he feared to be betrayed into emotion . Ralph shook his head . " If your hopes are pinned on that , you would do better to relinquish them . The last time I spoke to your grandfather , before he had his stroke , he told me all was willed to Jason . " " So much the better , " retorted Matthew , though his heart sank . " For I shall at least get credit for the purity of my intentions . " " Let us change the subject  --  ' t is but a poor prelude to a social evening . Here comes my wife  --  and my daughter Orabella . " No schoolroom miss could have made a more demure entrance in her mother 's shadow than Miss Orabella Burmester . Lydia , bland and mild , undisturbed by her own lateness or her husband 's displeasure , greeted the guest with a warm simplicity . " You have been too long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome you . Look , here is little Orry , whom you last remember with a rattle in her hand . " " Now it is on her tongue , " put in Ralph , endeavouring to recover his tenure as a host . He ruffled his daughter 's curls as Orabella , with rashes lowered , sank into her curtsy at the visitor 's feet . BRISTOL 79 " Save for the absence of the rattle , I could have sworn ' t was but a minute since we met ! " said Matthew as she rose . Orabella glared and , in passing , ground down her little foot on his . As hers was heelless , and covered in satin , he was hardly aware of the pressure . " But where is Pally ? " asked Lydia , looking about for her eldest daughter . Ralph flashed her a meaningful glance , which she returned . " What have you done with Pally ? " hers said ; and his , " Have patience ; all will be well . " " You would like to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; as Matthew turned , she held up toward him a purring bundle , soft with sleep and fire-warmth . Lydia had gone to Ralph and wag speaking to him in a low voice . " I hope you like cats , " Orabella challengedhim across the kitten 's ears , which he rubbed as he bent to re-tort : " I like some  --  the two-legged sort ! " " Hush  --  here she comes ! " There was a rich , hesitant rustle  --  of all sounds the most romantic !  --  a tinkle , as though something had been dropped , and a pause , while it was picked up . " Your fan , Miss Pallasoh , la , it 's broken ! " " Get me another . " The door , which had closed behind Lydia and Orabella , was opened ; Orabella hissed into his ear , " Here she is , my poor lame , squint-eyed sister ! " and Matthew found himself face to face with the glory and ruin of his life . IIIShe wore a gown of striped satin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with little flowers . It gave her the air of a Georgian Primavera as she came forward , her lap all filled with blossoms , her shining hair dressed high and lightly powdered to make a framework for her pale , quiet face . Her lips  --  which she had bitten almost to bleeding  --  were the colour of the red stripes in her gown ; the drops of pearl she wore in her ears were no paler than the rest of her face . For some reason there was silence as she came down the room in a gown whose beauty her own made insignificant . The proud lift of her bosom , the free thrust of her thighs against the satin that confined them , gave her an air of the goddess for whom she was named . Ralph , who at that moment was none too pleased with his eldest daughter , thought , " It is not to be wondered at that they lose their wits. 8o THE SUN IS MY UNDOINGover her ! " She was Lydia , with a more rich and earthy quality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . By hers , Orabella 's blond lovelinessbecame tinselly as a puppet 's . It is significant that Matthew , who was regarded , and regarded himself , as a connoisseur in female adornment , saw nothing of hers . What indeed were fashions , on that olympianform ? He was tired of little , fragile women , of their foolish feminine maunderings , their mysterious sicknesses , their caprice in the bestowal or withholding of favours . He wanted , suddenly , a mate as strong and ruthless as himself . Perhaps , he consoled himself , this girl would not know how to he ruthless . Her lips were soft , her manner admirably disciplined ; but there was no lack of strength in the small , square jaw , or of resolution in the broad , flat brow upon whose left temple lay  --  oh , blessed device !  --  a velvety mole , for the like of which a London beauty would have racked her patchbox . At dinner he sat beside her  --  between her and Lydia  --  with , opposite , the mocking lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears ! ) and beyond , taciturn , Ralph , whom he now knew as his enemy . It was all explained  --  that cold , unwilling hospitality . He was being warned off , the unwanted suitor for Pallas 's hand . An unnecessary precaution ! Perhaps the girl herself had been warned , for there was something remote about her , something that would have kept his advances  --  had he chosen to make them  --  at bay . The dinner was not a success . Orabella chattered , until snubbed by her father ; and Lydia , as always , was gently abstracted , the balm of her sweet , vague smiles failing to soothe the nervous irritation of her companions . For the entertainment of the ladies , Matthew turned the conversationupon London affairs and particularly upon the new monarch , who was viewed with little favour in the circles Matthew frequented ; in deference to his host 's opinions , which he suspected , moderating the more salty comments of society upon the bourgeois decorum , the insularityand narrow self-satisfaction of the third George . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a king who speaks the English language , " he said on the note of amused tolerance on which it was fashionable to speak of the sovereign . " And I dare say the coronation will be as magnificent as such ceremonies are wont to be , for all His Majesty 's prejudice on the subject of frivolous expenditure ! " " It is a pity , " pouted Miss Orabella , " that there is no queen to share the jubilations with him ! For I 'm sure a bachelor court can be nothingBRISTOL 81but dreary , with no ladies to lead the fashions and set a standard of ele-gance . " Matthew laughed . " They say there is much alarm in court circles on account of His Majesty 's attachment to Lady Sarah Lennox  --  " he was beginning , to be interrupted by Pallas , who had caught the cold flash of her father 's eye . " It is indeed a wonderful time for a young man to come to the throne . " Her voice was gentle and thoughtful . " How great an inheritance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandeur ! To be king of a country like Britain at the height of her glory must indeed be a source of inspiration ; do you not find it so ? " She appealed to Matthew , who , surprised by the soft , gleaming ardour of her glance , was for a moment at a loss for a reply . It was Ralph who said shortly : " Let us hope he finds it so  --  I speak of His Majesty . Let us hope we have no cause too bitterly to lament the loss of a sovereign who learned by forty years of hard experience the duties of acquiescence in the politicalconditions of a constitutional monarchy . " Orabella puffed out an impatient breath ; she had so wanted to hear more of Lady Sarah Lennox , but dared not reopen the subject with her father in this mood . How tiresome was Pally , trailing the conversationaway on tedious political subjects , just when it began to be interesting . " I 'd like to see the coronation , " said Lydia unexpectedly . " And I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fast-beating heart . Surely , with her mother and Pallas united , her father could not refuse . " You will think we are very countrified , " added Pallas , with a little smile half proud , half defiant , that made Matthew catch his breath , " but my sister and I have never been to the metropolis , and there is so much I long to see It was on the tip of his tongue to offer his escort , there and then ; prudence fortunately got the upper hand of impetuosity . What was it about her that so captivated his imagination ? He thought of other women with whom , from time to time , he had fanciedhimself in love : bold , highly bred creatures , careless of the conventions , loud-tongued , free in their conversations as men , shameless in their desires . Be had often aspired to attach such a one as these permanentlyto his person  --  a brazen tribute to his powers with women  --  and had always lacked means to do so . Only a gilded bait could capture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the most of what , in moments of vagary or boredom , they chose to accord him . She was still smiling at him , and as he returned her smile he thought with sudden and poignant regret , " What tragedy  --  that we should never suit each other ! " For even his overweening vanity , which fed upon the persuasion that there was no feat in the world of which he was not capable , failed to convince him that his spirit could inhabit those heights upon which hers had its dwelling . Video mcliora proboque , deteriora sequor . It was the shadow upon his life that , unable to help recognizing virtue when he met it , he felt impelled to flee from it , as he would never have fled from the devil . This , he supposed , was the aftermath of a childhood in which , through coercion and exhortation , virtue had come to be so abhorrent to him that he was prepared to go to any lengths to avoid contact with it . Yet he did not wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pagan aspects of her femininity which made their usual powerful appeal to him . As the evening wore on and unbridled imagination , stimulated by the wine he had drunk , took possession of his senses , he had an almost physical consciousness of her presence ; he could picture , with unholy clearness , those long pliant limbs and his own knitted together , and from their godlike union the forthspringing of a splendid race . He felt himself tremble as he watched her at the piano , a new and fashionable instrument which had only just found its way to Bristol , performing one of those icily classical little pieces that fashion favoured . The frail notes , falling like rain upon his quivering awareness of her body , suddenly recalled the gift he had brought , and he began to wonder how to present it . Ralph sat by the fire with a book , and the reluctant Orry held prisoneron the arm of his chair . He had quite given up the pretence of being sociable . Lydia yawned sweetly over her patience cards , dropping now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on between Matthew , Pallas , and Orry . It was just such a domestic evening as he would have sworn gave him the horrors , yet he was caught in its spell . In his childhood he would have enjoyed evenings like these ; now it was too late  --  sophistication had cloyed his palate for simpler pleasures . Yet he would have put up with much greater extremesof boredom for the sake of being within sight and sound of Pallas . BRISTOL 83 " You 're yawning , Orry ! It 's time you went to bed . " " For pity 's sake , Mamma ! " cried Orabella , with tears of mortification springing to her bright eyes . " One would think I was still a baby instead of  --  instead of a seasoned woman of the world ' ! " Behind the chair-back she pulled a wicked face at Matthew , who joined in the laughter her words drew forth . " Well , what does it mean , to be ' seasoned ' ? I have finished doing lessons , I go to the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not my fault if I have n't got as many  --  as many  --  admirers ! " To the consternation of her audience , she burst into tears , covering her face with her hands in a childish fashion and sobbingheart-rendingly . It was a trick she had had since childhood ; at parties Orry would suddenly get overtired and overexcited , and sob in that broken-hearted fashion , the more violent for the brief duration of her grief . " Poor darling  --  she has done too much ! " Pallas was crying tenderly as she held her sister 's hands . Ralph was muttering endearments . Only Lydia , to Matthew 's amusement , sat calmly , the cards slipping through her white fingers . " Take her to bed , Pally . " " I wo n't have Pally put me to bed . I 'm not tired  --  oh , dear , the room 's so hot  --  and so full of people ! " She seemed hardly to know what she was saying . She suddenly flung her arms round her father 's neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I know there 'll be rabbits in the field ! Please , please , dear Papa , walk with me to the end of the garden . I 'm dying for a little air . " They went out through the long window that , Matthew remembered , led to the terrace , Pallas calling to her sister to wait for a shawl , which she snatched from the back of a chair and ran to fling over Orry 's shoulders . For a moment they stood there , the tall and the little tree , with the moonlight behind them . Then , with an enigmatical look , Orabellareached up to kiss Pallas 's lips and went quite calmly into the garden . Pallas came back , looking as though something was puzzling her . " I thought Orry had grown out of her crying fits ; it 's a long time since she had one , " Lydia was saying . " Pally , did I lock the stillroom door after giving you your dose ? " " I ca n't remember , Mamma . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence of a visitor of the opposite sex . " If you give me your keys I will go and look . " 84 TILE SUN IS MY UNDOING " I will go myself , " said Lydia , " for I think Orry would be the better of a draught before she goes to bed . Perhaps you , Matthew , would oblige me by collecting my cards . " They were together , and alone . It was Pallas who , as though she feared inaction , moved to pick up the cards . He had the gift in his hand , and he had forgotten the frivolous cornplimentwith which lie had intended to present it . As he held it out toward her his voice dried in his throat ; he could remember no other occasion on Vlll h he had been embarrassed before a woman . Pallas , looking without understanding at the little round object , asked : " What is it ? " Ile gave a tiny handle a twirl that scattered a few notes like petals from the rose of time . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the blood run up her white throat till all of that lovely face , so nearly on a level with his own , was in a flame . Their eyes met across the little musical box , the only one he had been able to find during his morning search , and as a shaft of almost terrible meaning sped from his to hers , she drew a gasping breath . " How strange you should remember ! " she stammered . " It 's been on my conscience for ten years . " He had recovered his selfcommandseemingly with the loss of hers . He had longed throughout the evening to find some way of breaking through that distant , sweet composure which , like a sheet of dim glass , made a screen between him and her . " It 's but a poor form of reparation , but I will find a better . Pray accept this , meanwhile , as earnest of my good intentions . " As she was silent , he continued hurriedly , " When do we meet again ? " " Arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all events until the will is read . Your father tells me there is nothing for me in it , but I prefer to make sure rather than trust to the good faith of my uncle Jason ! " " I am so sorry  --  for your grandfather 's death . " " We have all to ( lie , so it behoves us to make the most of the life that is in us . When do I see you again ? " he persisted . " I  --  I do n't know . Mamma will invite you " If you ask her ? Tell me : you want to see me ? " He cursed this crude and graceless wooing , but knew that at any moment they might be interrupted . Even as he spoke , Orabella 's clear voice , obviously lifted , BRISTOL 85sounded from the terrace . Pallas gave him one more look , and rushed from the room . IV " You 'll admit I did the very best I could for you , Pally ! " " I do n't know what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying fit was genuine ? " scornfullyinquired Orabella . " I knew it was the only way of getting Papa from the room . " Mischief twinkled in her eye . " I knew , of course , Mamma would go while we were away . " " Orry , you did n't tell Mamma ! " " I certainly did not . But I think there is nothing Mamma would not do , dear Pally , to get you happily wed ; and she always had a tender penchant for Matthew . " She looked shrewdly at her sister . " I hope he made the most of his opportunity . He may be a passionate admirer , but he certainly is n't a very tactful one ; he set Papa 's teeth well on edge during the evening . " " Perhaps that was not his fault  --  Papa wishes me to marry Sam Peddy . " " So that was it ! I thought when you came in you looked as if someone had banged you on the head . Well , Sam 's very nice , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so Papa tells me "  --  she had evidently made the most of her stroll in the garden  --  " gets nothing at all in his grandfather 's will , and has no means of support but his wits . Still , it may be very agreeable to live on your wits . I 'll tell you what , Pally ! Perhaps Papa will let you off if I say I 'll marry Sam . I dare say I could make him quite fond of me if you were out of the way . " " Do you suppose that would make any difference to Papa 's objection to Matthew ? The odd part is , I see so clearly how right he is ; yet I do n't  --  seem  --  to  --  care , " said Pallas slowly . " Of course , he is terribly struck on you !  --  and I wish to goodness the course of true love would run smooth , for then I should have a chance or two . It may interest you to hear I made quite an impression  --  which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on you . It 's no joke to have a sister who sets every man afire that comes near her , and if I had not the sweetest nature in the world , I would by now be quite embitteredabout it . " 86 THE SUN IS MY UNDOINGPallas managed to smile . " It sounds as though I had better go away . For I know I shall never marry Matthew , and for me there is no man but him . " " 0 all the poor , faint-hearted ways of looking at it ! Pallas Burmester , I 'm truly surprised at you ! You know as well as I do that where there 's a will there 's a way . " " Supposing the way were too hard ? " " I thought you were in love with him ? " reproached Orabella . " I was n't thinking of myself , but of him . You know , Orry , I am terriblystubborn , and there are things I must have . . . things I doubt whether Matthew would give me ; and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , " said Pallas breathlessly , " that tonight , if he had held out his hand and said , Come ! ' I believe I 'd have gone with him  --  to the ends of the earth . " " I 'm glad you did n't ; I do n't want to be done out of the amusement of a wedding ; and it would quite blight my prospects if there was a scandal about you . You wo n't do anything ridiculous like running away , Pally , will you ? " asked Orabella anxiously . " No  --  I do n't think so . No , I would n't . I do n't believe any good comes of snatching selfishly at one 's own personal happiness , and I would not for the world grieve Papa and Mamma . " " Shall you pray about it ? " asked Orabella in a small voice . " I expect so . You might do the same  --  if you love me , Orry . " CHAPTER VIIIOU ca n't live in Bristol and not feel the pull of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already proved it to be true . The very presence , in the heart of the town , of the tall-masted ships , the curious network their rigging flung over the background of tumbling , rose-red roofs and little bulging facades , the fluting of a boatswain 's pipe  --  all these so coloured the thoughts of the people that many who had never left dry land looked upon themselves as seafarers . There were strange silver mornings when those floating houses made their majestic departure from the harbor , in that hushed air of utter remoteness a ship assumes from the moment she weighs anchor ; when the sense of detachment from all land ties , widening with the widening of the strip of water between hull and quay , communicated itself in a light cloud of melancholy to all who are left behind . Matthew could scarcely bear to look : so blazing sweet his love for Pallas  --  and all mixed up with the bulging wooden sides , vast sternworks , and cumbrous painted beakheads , representing , each one , a fortune to its owner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had made him squander means that might now have been profitablyemployed ; he was infuriated by his own poverty . The sight of the slave captains swaggering on the Backs , with their black men in attendance , their gold-laced and gold-buttoned attire , brought poignantly home to him the rich gleanings to be had of this particular harvest , and he racked his brains to devise some means of raising the capital that might re-establish his fortune . It was unhappily too true that he had exhausted every likely source of credit ; the only thing now was to try the unlikely ones  --  if he could discover where they lay . " That 's your grandfather 's Pride o ' Bristol  --  and there 's the Virgin Queen he owned with Jack Peddy and Shergill ; the old Queen 's made8788 THE SUN IS MY UNDOING a mint o ' money in her time , but they say she 'll not stand up to an- other crossing . " " What do you know of Shcrgill ? " it struck him to ask Abiathar in the tavern where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a seafaring crowd . " Lawyer Tom ? " Abiathar rubbed his nose with the back of his oddly decorated hand . " Him and your grandfather was thick as thieves  --  only not , I fancy , over law matters . The law 's not done as well for Tom as other occypations ; though , mind ye , it 's useful to be a lawyer , and it 's pulled Tom and his friends out of some plaguy tight corners afore now ! " " Is he a person to rely on ? " Abiathar delivered his slow , blinding wink . " Depends who ye are . I 've heard tell Tom 's a damned good friend and a damned bad enemy , but if there 's aught to be made out of it , I reckon his friends and his enemies can depend on Tom for one thing equal  --  to feather his nest at their expense ! " he chuckled . " That 's what I thought . Though what the devil he expects to get out of me , I 'm damned if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Abiathar looked sidelong at his companion . " What with his bankin ' and his shippin ' , he 's done better than a lot of folks as makes more show . And I 'll tell ye something : he 's a fella of strong likes an ' dislikes . If there 's a man he hates in Bristol , it 's yer uncle Jason : so if he 's agreeable to you , it 's as likely as not for the sake o ' spiting Jason . " " Would that be a matter of taste  --  or something deeper ? " inquired Matthew , more carelessly than he was thinking . It might be important to develop a line of antagonism between Jason and the one person who , so far , had offered him any practical assistance . " There may be truth in the tale Jason once got the better of him , though it 's a yarn I beg leave to discredit ! For Tom 's as cunning as a weasel , and has the whole book o ' the law under his poucey wig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bidding me eat turtle at his house tonight . " " At his house , eh ? Spreading his web to catch the fly again ! " Abia- thar roared with laughter . " Take my advice , cock , and confine your dealings with Torn to office hours . It 'd go to my heart to see you corn- ing down St. Nicholas ' aisle with Totty Shergill on your arm ! Though BRISTOL 89'tis shame to make game o ' the poor creature , that ca n't help her ill looks no more than a fella like me can help his handsomeness . It 's a solemnreflection on a woman , all the same , that she ca n't get a husband in spite of Tom 's money , which he 'd part with handsome to get her off his hands . " " I wonder you do n't offer yourself . A sailor 's life is such that he does n't need to make heavy weather of matrimony ; and if Miss Shergill has so good a dowry " " I 've had a go at it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , to do her justice , was willing enough , Tom played me false  --  damn him ! That 's the worst of having a lawyer for your father-in-law . Having got wind of another little ceremony which  --  by Jesus !  --  had entirely slipped my memory , he goes pokin ' around . ' Biathar , ' sez he , God knows I ai n't one to make difficulties , and , but for your own plaguy indiscretions an ' leavin ' your tracks right and left , I 'd have winked at it ; but bigamy smells too bad , and I 've got my position to think of '  --  which was civil enough when you come to consider it . " " Do you know what the dowry amounts to ? " said Matthew , laughing . " ' T was five thousand in them days , but it 'd be doubled if Tom got what he thought a fair offer . Ten bloody thousand , and a plain woman thrown in . " " She must be monstrous plain ! " " It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! Ten thousand  --  it 'd float the Cassiopeia ; it 'd make you an ' me two-thirds own-ers " You tempt me . At least "  --  Matthew bit his lip  --  " I 'd have been tempted , twenty-four hours ago . " Abiathar shot at him a look of profound intelligence . " I take you , cock . There 's many a Bristol bee has drunk itself silly on that honey ! " " Well , what the devil am I to do ? God knows , I 'm in enough of a coil without this to tangle it , but I swear I 'll have her if I burn up the harbour . " " I know of twenty others that says the same ; and it 's no more than fair to warn you , Sam Peddy 's only one of the fellas that 's after her  --  and the old folks favour it . " 90 THE SUN IS MY UNDOING " Do you mean that gangling whippersnapper in the Punch-and-Judy outfit we saw in Cooke 's ? " sneered Matthew . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little finger . " " He do n't cut much of a figure , " admitted Abiathar , " though he 's a good , earnest lad , and set on going into the wool trade . Better take stock of yer competitors , cock ; it 's only fools goes around blindfold . Peddys and Burn-testers are hand an ' glove , and ' t is a useful combination of family interests . If it was n't for young madam , that 's got a will of her own , it 'd all be signed and sealed ; so , if you 've got an eye in that direction , I advise ye to move quickly . Pally Burmester 's not the only one with a will , and from all you tell me , I 'd not think it odd if Burmester was to force matters to a head between her and young Sam  --  part ic'larly as he 's got Sam 's father to back him up . " " You seem well enough informed in local affairs ! " said Matthew on an unpleasant note . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fall into the habit of regarding him as an inferior , and he had invited a snub by that glib shortening of Pallas 's beautiful name . " What 's a land-bound sailor to do but sit around and listen to what folks is saying ? " asked Abiathar simply . " There 's days I 'd sell my soul for the crack of the crossjacks afore a nor'easter ; but there 's little goes on that does n't get down to the quays , and it 'd shock some of the Castle Green gentry if they knew all we could tell about their goings-on ! What 's to do ? "  --  for Matthew had turned quickly to the wall as two men came into the tavern . One was considerably older than the other , and both were in travelling-clothes and looked a couple of sharp tits prepared to show the slow-witted West Country men how things were done in London ; one ordered beer , in pronounced Cockney accents , while the other peered sharply round the smoke-bedimmed taproom . " Who are they ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The old ' un I 've seen around plenty times ; they say he 's from Gloucester and deals in grain . T'other 's a stranger , but , by the cut of his jib , I 'd say he 's the old ' un 's son . " Matthew gave a short laugh of relief and turned round again . " That 'll do for me . " He beckoned the potboy and ordered brandy , " Egad , I 'd almost as soon wear the handcuffs as dream ' em ! What time did you say the London coach gets in ? " " It 's due in the Sarazen yard between four and six ; but they 've had aBRISTOL 91breakdown the other side Marlborough , and it 'd surprise me if they make it afore tomorrow . " " Confusion to all wheelwrights ! That gives me at any rate a few hours ' reprieve . Blast your eyes ! " cried Matthew as Abiathar , with a clumsy movement , knocked over the tankard at his elbow . The beer soaked into Matthew 's small-clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of garments with him . " Confound you , you 'll have me as ramshackle-looking as you are yourself ! " " If I chose to be unpleasant , " said Abiathar , his cheeks  --  as much of them as was visible above his burning beard  --  purpling with resentment of the insult , " I might say they ai n't partic'lar in Newgate ! " " I 'll fight you for that . " " I would n't if I was you , cock . " He heaved his great body lazily from the settle and stood , feet apart , facing Matthew and hitching the dingy breeches that sagged about his hips . " ' Tai n't a question of who beats who , for I wager we 're a match in weight , though you top me by an inch , and maybe my fists are in better fettle than yours for settlin ' argyments . Save yer guts an ' yer muscles for yer enemies  --  I 've a notion yell make a few ! Do n't go wasting ' em on yer friends . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeated by Abiathar 's good humour , yet spoiling for means of working off the bile within him . " Here 's one , ye swab ! Hark'ee : I 've been in the same hole you 're in now  --  scared to turn a corner for fear of forfeiting my liberty ! I 'd sooner use my fists for you than against you . Stick by me , cock , and I 'll stick by you . " " I fail to see what advantage my support can bring you , " muttered Matthew sourly . " I 'll tell you . You 've got the entrance where I , as a rough customer  --  not to speak o ' my present rig  --  ai n't welcome . ' T was another tale in the old days , when me laced coat with moidores for buttons and me fine cocked hat set every lackey racin ' , and I was well-nigh suffocated by women as 'd sooner smell sea-salt than pomade on a man 's hair ! Now the town 's filled up with gentleman skippers , an ' black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't that I bear malice . It only makes one think of old times . " " But you 're still on terms with men like Shergill and Peddy and Burmester : your conversation shows it . " " Aye  --  if to be on terms ' is Good day , Crown , ' How 's the weather , 92 THE SUN IS MY UNDOING Cap'n ? '  --  maybe a bottle of wine if we meet in a tavern , but that do n't happen these days . I 've no wish to embarrass them with exhibiting myself in their company  --  like I 've embarrassed you . " " Nothing of the sort ! " But Matthew 's ears burned guiltily . " Do n't trouble yourself , cock . It 's only human nater  --  and you 've got less cause for shame than them . ' Tai n't my rig as shames ' em : it 's knowing I know they 've let me down . There ai n't one of ' em could n't at some time or other have put in a word that 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's as well . I 'm beholden to nobody . " " Well , what can I do for you , ' Biathar ? " " In places you go , there must be a deal o ' talk about shipping ; and there 's one ship now in harbour that 's got such a hummin ' and buzzin ' about her , it 's sure to come up in the course o ' conversation . It 's the Cassiopeia , that I spoke of before ; she 's been for sale this last eighteen month , and now it 's been one and now another that 's for buying her , but the deal 's always fallen through . ' Tween ourselves "  --  Abiathar 's finger was laid to his nose  --  " they 're asking a bit too much for her . Hey ! " he bellowed across his shoulder . " What was they asking for Cassy peer ? " Opinions varied , between eight and nine thousand pounds . A flash- ily dressed person who seemed to fancy himself as an expert on ship- ping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been lying in Seamill for the last twenty months ! " " Choke ycr landlubber 's lull ! The weather she came through her last trip was enough to twist the guts of a first-rate , an ' Bill Sparke , that 's been working on her , says there 's not a rotten pin in her now from stem to stern . " " Get along ; she 's got worm in her . When I went down to have a look at her , she 'd got enough lime atween wind and water to float a battleship ! If she gets across the ocean once more , it 'll be to pile up on Dahomey beach . " " A lot you know about it . She 's right good British oak , and I ' mem- ber seeing her dried out in the yards six or seven year ago ; I wager there ai n't a spot o ' mildew in her . " " Thinking o ' buying her , ' Biathar ? " queried a wag , with a wink at his companions . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flood an ' me , we was just discussing a little pleasure cruise . " There was a roar of laughter , BRISTOL 9but not a few eyes turned calculatingly on Matthew . The name c Flood still carried significance in shipping circles , but this young ' u was the fly-by-night , the ne'er-do-well . . . . Not too pleased at havin attention focused on himself , Matthew leaned across to say sharply " Well , what more do you want to know about her ? " " Oh , bucko ! " Abiathar had lowered his voice . " What a chance to b missing , for want of the miserable wherewithal ! You an ' me  --  partnel  --  and a ship like Cassypeer  --  an ' princes 'd envy us ! " Matthew could not control the great , ticking leap of his heart at th picture Abiathar 's words conjured up , but he answered coolly : " According to your flashy friend yonder , opinions seem to vary o that score . " " Hark'ee : nine thousand 's a lot o ' money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I know every inch o ' that brig . Her fittings is most of ' em i place , and she 's in right good seagoing condition . A bit of caulking an , a coat o ' paint round her bulwarks , and she 's as tidy a craft as eve sailed the Atlantic . " " You should know . " " I should , and I do ; and the tale 's going round there 's some owne after her , but they 're that close in their dealings you ca n't get to knot a thing afore she 's sailin ' down the river , with some cunning bastar , that 's a crony of the owner 's grinnin ' up his sleeve . So far 's my luc. goes , it might just touch off the gun if I was to get in my word befor the news was all over the place . When a ship 's bought and charterec and the chatter 's all over the drawing-rooms , it 's too late for a fellot like me . The owner 's wife or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a skipper , related to the family , that 's got to have the new cote mand ! Only let me get at the owners themselves and talk man-talk and to hell with all the cluckin ' females , frying their own little fist over their parlour grates . " " I 'll surely do that for you , " said Matthew seriously , " and I only hop that the good disposition of Grandfather 's friends to his grandson wil continue , and that I 'll have more opportunities than I see in view a the moment . For I do n't flatter myself I 'm likely to be made welcom at the Burmesters ' in future , and , damme , an evening with Shergi and his ugly daughter 's a heavy price to pay for a plate of turtle ! must see if I can get friendly with the Peddys or the Cruikshanks , fo they 're more likely to produce useful information than anyone ii Bristol I can think of . " 94 THE SUN IS MY UNDOING " Take a tip from me , cock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your grandfather 's will , do n't be too quick to contradict it  --  see ? It never does harm to keep folks guessing , and if they choose to think you 're due for your share o ' the money , you 'll be welcome in quarters that ai n't so hospitable when a fellow 's low in pocket . I got my car to the mast , cock ; it ai n't that Bristol folk are any more mercenarythan clsewheres , but money talks , and folks is apt to be hard o ' hearing unless you can play the right tune . " " To hell with them . " Blackness again descended on Matthew 's brow . " It 's had enough to be a pauper without the additional plague of being treated as though one were heir to a fortune . Is there any living soul in Bristol who 's likely to know the truth about this business ? For , damme , with one thing and another I 'll be out of my mind before Friday comes . " " There 's little as Lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " That had occurred to me , naturally , when he was so oncoming yesterday ; it 's my main reason for supping with him tonight . " " And it 's he , if anyone , ' 11 know about the Cassiopeia . It ' ud n't surprise me if he 'd got a finger in the pie himself , for , ' sides being partownerwith your grandfather and Cruikshank in the old Queen , he 's got a fourth or fifth share in the Nautilus brig that come in last week with a prime cargo of muscovado  --  now unloading at Kingsmill . Tom 's always ready for a flutter in shipping , so find out what ye can : it might profit us both . How 'd ye like , cock , to take a trip to the Guinea coast an ' back ? " He dug Matthew persuasively in the ribs . " It depends in what capacity . " Matthew smiled . " I 'd surely like to have a look into the business of slaving , but I 've no taste for the seaman'slife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be more profitably employed ashore . " His cool words concealed , nevertheless , an immense excitement . It was diabolical how the whole of his present life was governed by uncertainties . A trip to the Guinea coast might prove a complete solution of his difficulties ; it would , at all events , put him out of reach of his creditors  --  if he managed to evade their attentions until the ship sailed . But it would mean resigning Pallas Burmester to the importunitiesof her many suitors , and that thought was intolerable to him . He had nothing ; he wanted everything . Above all  --  throughout the day the certainty had been growing in him  --  he wanted Pallas , with-BRISTOL 95out whom the future was void . But was it not equally void without money ? " Is there any way , " he asked suddenly , " in which one might get taken on as factor for a trip like that ? " A factor would at least commandsome sort of salary , and he relied on his own wits to make use of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would soon master the intricacies of trading . Abiathar clapped him on the back . " We 'll find better use for your abilities when the time comes ! Meanwhile "  --  theportentous eyelid descended  --  " make the best use of your acquaintance with Tom , and remember : ' t is them as asks for most gets most , in the end ! " IIThe gardens were filled with the delicate melancholy of Michaelmas daisies , and blackened cadavers of giant sunflowers sagged on the walls . There were no more drifting idlers on College Green nor swaggeringredcoats to ogle the nursemaids with their hoop-rolling charges . No more chances for lovers ' meetings , for the rain had turned suddenly to fog , and there was a cold snap of frost in the air . It was Orabella 's sharp eyes that . spied Matthew from the window of Mrs. Hannah James 's hat-parlour , where , as usual , she had decoyed Pallas on the morning walk which Lydia insisted on for the good of the girls ' health . Miss Orry was as fastidious as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet it was she who tore down King Street with an indecent flapping of flounces and , twisting her ankle in her haste , was almost flung into Matthew 's arms . " Never mind my stupid ankle  --  you can at least give me your arm as we go back  --  and I 'm sure it 's enough excuse for anybody , " she gasped incoherently . " Come quickly  --  do n't stand there gaping  --  and the rain ruining my new velvet bonnet that 's only half trimmed ! " Matthew almost laughed outright to see the comical erection of pins and ribbon that represented the initial stages in decoration of Miss Orabella 's head . " Was there ever so slow a fellow ? Pally and I are at Mrs. James 's  --  and there 's no one else there at all for the moment . Mrs. James would never tell , because we are such good customers  --  and it 's your only chance , you know ! Papa was n't at all pleased with you on Monday night . " 96 THE SUN IS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the trick you played on me ? " asked Matthew , pinching her arm as he hurried back . She paid no attention to pinch or question , bundling him through a door on the left of the tiny hall , into a little cupboard of a room , scattered with feminine frippery , its floor strewn with pins , and alarming shapes of buckram , like capricious flowers , on every surface that offered support for Mrs. Hannah James 's creations . " And if anybody comes , I shall sneeze at the top of my voice , so make sure you 're listening ! " cautioned Orabella in departure . For the first time in his life Matthew found himself at a loss in the presence of a woman . No woman had ever called up in him the strange blend of emotions that Pallas evoked  --  standing there , all softly confused in her cape of rain-misted fur , her cheeks burning with a more vivid rose than at their former meeting ; she was younger , tenderer , more irresistible than ever in her confusion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensation of humility and reverence  --  two qualities of which he would have denied the possession . " So wild of Orry ! " she was murmuring . Had he but known it , his hesitation  --  which he inwardly deplored  --  went further toward conquering her heart than any boldness he might have shown ; it was so evident that Matthew was not accustomed to hesitate in his approach to women ! He took her hand , which she was holding out to him , and looked at it as though he found it hard to credit the existence of anything so delicate and rare , before lifting it to his lips . " I have indeed been blessed by fortune ! " His voice sounded thick and unnatural ; he thought , She 'll think I 'm the veriest clown ! " How odd a place , for a meeting ! " She seemed to take courage from his discomfiture . She smiled and pointed to a chair , from which Orabellahad impetuously swept the twirls and clippings of buckram to the floor . She herself sat on the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely by her action . Matthew was used to milliners ' parlours as rendezvous , to the sly-eyed connivance of modistes whose palms went out for the guineas that were supposed to seal their lips . He knew the very look and smell of such places , reeking with their clandestine associations , and did not for a moment doubt that even in the simple West Country Mrs. James derived an agreeable addition to her income by a discreet humouring of local turpitude . But there wasBRISTOL 97that in Pallas 's bearing , in the serene dignity of her demeanour , which dismissed all scandalous suggestion ; she might have been receiving him in her mother 's drawing-room , with Lydia within call . " I had not dared to hope  --  " he stammered . " To hope  --  for what ? " " For the opportunity of asking your pardon . " " For what am I to pardon you ? " Her lips twitched as thoughshe would have liked to smile , but preserved , instead , an admirable solemnity . " For my behaviour of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire was to please you , to efface , if possible , an unfortunate memory  --  to act like a boor ! To make demands ! " She was too sincere to pretend misunderstanding . " Your demands , sir  --  I presume you mean your wish to see me again  --  were of a kind which most women would find flattering . I wo n't except myself from the general ! " She laughed outright . " I 'm afraid my own behaviour was sadly lacking in propriety of the kind to which you , in society , are accustomed ; but , to tell you the truth , I was put out of countenance by Orry 's behaviour  --  as , indeed , I am atthis moment . My little sister 's a shocking madcap , but so good at heart that no one takes offence at it . " " I would be the last to do so , since I owe her this ! " he answered .

You know , we are stiff-necked patriots in Bristol ; we havenot those opportunities , which you , no doubt enjoy , of cultivating the familiarity that breeds disrespect ! " " You forget I am a Bristol man , " he told her , smiling ; he was a little taken aback to find himself being proud of it . " We shall be proud if you become one , " she flashed back at him ; he was quick to seize his advantage . " Would it please you if I did ?

Here they were , in circumstances a hundred times more propitious for love 's dalliance than the surroundings of her home , and she held him at arm 's length ; they were far , far distanter from each other than they had been during those throbbing moments in Lydia 's drawingroom . He cast about him for some means of breaking the spell . " If you would but express an opinion , I give you my word I should devote myself so to moulding my future life that it might gratify you as its authoress ! " " Oh , sir , " she gasped , " I could not be made so responsible ! " " The other day , " he pointed out , " you called me Matthew . " " Did I ? " Her eyelids fluttered . " It was a slip of the tongue  --  onefalls without thinking into old habits . After all , we did play together as children ! " " Do some miles of distance , and a little space of years , make all that difference ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame you  --  that we can not be playfellows now ? " She must hear the ring of hypocrisy in the words , for no playfellowship could fulfil his present need . " You know I did not hate you ! " she accused him faintly . " Then say Matthew ! " " Matthew , " she whispered . " Pallas ! Ah , that is better . " He flung back his shoulders as though consciously throwing off a weight , and laughed . So much for Ralph 13urmcstcr ! How deep , he wondered , went the roots of her filial affection ? " Pallas , Pallas , Pallas ! " he repeated it almost savagely . " Pallas , do you know there are a thousand questions I want to ask you ? " Catchingher two hands in his own , he pressed their palms together , bending his head  --  a very little  --  so that their eyes were level . " Will you play the sweet penitent , and tell me everything that has been in your life since the day I broke your musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an equal confession from him ? A pretty situation it would be if she did ! He knew , suddenly , disconcertingly , that it would be impossible to lie to Pallas . " It would be like reading a very dull book , " she told him with a sweet smile . " A woman 's life is such a little one , is n't it ? Especially in a town like ours , where it is not considered proper for a woman to take much interest in anything but her home ! How odd that seems , when one thinks of someone like Mrs. Peddy , whose first husband was aBRISTOL 99sea captain , and she went on all his voyages with him , until the day he died . Yet , if you ask Mrs. Peddy to tell you about her adventures , she stares as if she thought you were crazy !

" But have you no love for the ordinary things that entertain women ? " he pursued . " Dancing , the play , card-playing , and so forth ? " Pallas shook her head regretfully . " I have a passion for dancing , " she confessed , " but cards I abhor . I want so much more ! To travel , to see foreign countries , to learn foreign languages so as to talk with the people and find out what they think about their own lives  --  and what they think of mine ! I should like to climb mountains and swim rivers " Diana ! " he chaffed her tenderly . " Do you think me foolish ? " she asked wistfully . " Is it always foolish to think differently from other people and to try experiments ? All the great discoveries have been made because someone was not content to follow an established rule . I am always longing to discover things , and Mamma says the first word I ever spoke was Why ? ' I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He found himself aching to gratify all her longings , and his brow darkened so ominously that he felt her recoil . " Why do you look like that ? " " Like what ? " He spoke absently , lost in his unhappy brooding . " As  --  as though somebody had blown a light out . There 's a deep line  --  almost a wrinkle  --  under each of your eyes that I 'm sure was n't there before . How should that be , on so young a face ? " " I will tell you . I am terribly anxious about the future . " Her brows flickered upward . " How can one be anxious about the future ? It is in our own hands . " " How so ? " " It is our present actions make the future , " she told him simply . He seized her hands again and held them tightly to his breast . " Pallas , is this part of our future ? " " It is bound to be , " she said with so final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept the import of her words . " Perhaps it is the past I fear , " he muttered as he raised his lips fromI00 THE SUN IS MY UNDOING BRISTOL IOIher tender , covered palms . " The past , which is always with us . What does the future mean  --  save the ever inaccessible ? " " It is for the future we live , " she assured him . It was the sound of an ear-splitting and all too artificial sneeze that prevented his asking what she meant by " living for the future " ; like all who live wholly on the material plane , he was always a little slow in grasping abstraction . But he left her , because to be discovered in her company might be fatal for them both , and avoided by a miracle , and the fortunate interpolation of a messenger with a tier of hat-boxes , the entrance of his aunt and cousins , on their way , no doubt , to purchase their mourning bonnets . " La , Mr. Flood ! " It was the devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hat to Miss Tony Shergill , whose acquaintance he had made in mortifying circumstances the previous evening . " To think of meeting you here . I hope you 've quite recovered from your sad indisposition ! " He had arrived at Shergill 's house  --  one of the new and roomy ones on Castle Green  --  to be received with the news that his host had been unexpectedly called to a dying client in Bedminster , but that , in her father 's absence , Miss Totty was fully prepared to entertain him . Remembering Abiathar 's warning , and resolved not to pass the eveningtote-a-tete with so unlikely a charmer , Matthew produced plausiblyenough his explanation : that he had called in the first place but to excuse himself , since the change of climate from London and the inclemency of the weather had brought on a phlegm that nothing but hot punch and bed could cure . This caused a fluster ; Miss Totty instantly declared herself inventor of " an infallible cure " for the phlegm , of which Mr. Flood was imploredto avail himself by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet as a mouse while I put compresses on your poor aching head , " she promised  --  an offer which was enough to make Matthew fly a mile ; for , in addition to her unconscionable plainness , the poor woman had bad breath . He did his best to avoid it , as he inquired of Miss Totty , ogling from beneath her rain-hood that , pulled over a vast bonnet , lent grotesque disproportion to her mincing figure , whether her father had yet returned . " Not yet ; I expect that stubborn old Farmer Ortright has decided not to die after all  --  and he never would make his will unless the doctor vowed he was at the very gates of death . " She tittered , " La , I 'm sure wills are in the air ! We think and talk of nothing else these ( lays ! " Ignoring this not very tactful reminder , Matthew was about to pass on when she cried out : " But , now I think of it : Papa is bound to be back this evening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose it 's about another ship ! You 'd never think a lawyer would have such a mania for ships as Papa , but I declare he thinks of little else , and I 'm sure he gets more pleasure out of a gamble in shipping than out of any of his books of law ! " Cassiopeia . The beautiful , resounding name ticked in Matthew 's brain , perhaps for no more reason than that he had so lately been speaking of her with Abiathar . To own such a ship  --  and Pallas Burmester  --  andthe house on Brandon Hill ! All the vague envies and desires he had lately experienced in his London life crystallized abruptly in an aspiration so dazzlingly clear it almost took his breath away . IIIDuring those restless nights which he had passed under Hercules ' roof  --  with the ice-cold remains of its one-time owner separated by only a foot or two of stone and panelling from the room in which Matthew lay  --  all the Flood tradition of security , of stability , of honourableownership of property and honest pride in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment those shoddy sentimentsof vainglory and boastfulness which up till now had been his only tributes to the stock to which he belonged . There he lay , on a bed in which his mother might have lain had they treated her better , experiencing for the first time the comforts of what should have been his birthright . When he opened his eyes in the morning , it was not upon the sordid kennel that was his London lodging  --  the torn draperies , the lascivious etchings , the indecencies of domestic disorder , and , ten to one , a whore at his side  --  but upon a room whose lofty spaces held the thoughts of his ancestors , the good , honourable citizens , the sober wives and mothers . He had always professedto despise his ancestry ; in those dark night-watches he began to think well of them , or , at any rate , of the things they had left behind : IO2 THE SUN IS MY UNDOINGtheir splendid panelling , their cornices loaded with swags and garlands , their carvcn fireplaces filled with Dutch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crystal , carrying twenty , or forty , or , in the case of the great drawing-room on the first floor , a hundred candles . He could see them in his mind , in their lappets and steinkerquesof Marlborough 's time , in their slashed doublets and short swinging cloaks of Elizabeth 's , sweeping the stairs and wide landings with their rich brocades . None had been great , in a world-wide or even national sense , or famous , but , serene in their prosperity of commerce , they had propagated from generation to generation their tradition of hospitality and generosity and carved their names into the history of their town . The thought of Jason , with his little , mean bourgeois ideas of living , inheriting the mansion he had begun so bitterly to covet made him weep in the night . Let Jason have all the rest  --  the business , the rents , the town property and interests he , Matthew , knew nothing about ; but for Christ 's sake let the house go to one who knew how to live in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perception of all that was due to so noble a possession ! And with his tears went his bitter regret that he had been the first to profane it by the shameless trick he had planned , less for his grandfather 's sake than to spite his uncle  --  yes , even honesty came to Matthew in those nights of wakefulness although it did not always last until morning . It was folly , in his present uncertain position , to think of pursuing his acquaintance with Pallas Burmester . A hundred self-righteous eyes and tongues would observe and report on their meetings , if they continued to risk them ; nor was she , if he read her rightly , the kind of young woman to he tempted into some clandestine affair . Pallas Burmcsterwas accustomed to hold up her head in the light ; no shady love-play would break down that palace of young virginity , which he found himself coveting the more passionately as his dread of failing to conquer it grew in his mind . It was partly the recent run of luck against him that had weakened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence to recognize in Pallas something altogether different from his former mistresses , whose virtue , in most cases , was as frail as their complexions . He was in love  --  he had bitterly to admit it  --  with a young woman who commanded his respect as well as his passion ; and a genuine respect , not the gimcrack affair of bowing andBRISTOL 103scraping , compliments and billets-doux , that passed for such in his London circle . But  --  her eyes , her lips , her hair , the soft peaks of her breasts under her satin gown ! Oh , most delectable of mountains , to be scaled by love alone ! And the supple length of her limbs that dwelt ever in his imagination , stretched along his own , to proclaim in every quivering muscle their predestined affinity ! She should be his if mortal will could make her so ; and all the forces of malice in the meantime should not prevent him from wringing from her some admission that her passion matched his own . With that gage of love once in his possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father , to demand an understanding . " I 've been in worse corners before , " he told himself , " and have always got myself out of them ; why should it not be so again ? " Yet his heart misgave him when he remembered by what means such liberations had been secured . A painful and puzzled longing to live henceforward according to his lady 's standards teased him ; through Pallas he had glimpsed , perhaps for the first time , the happiness and freedom of living an honourable life , and he racked his brains to discover how this could be devised . IV " Twelve coaches  --  with six horses each  --  and the bell to toll for sixteenhours ! " Jason was moaning . " ' T is an abomination of squandering , and will be a sore affront to the brethren . " " Your late father did not belong to your sect , Mr. Flood  --  and the town will expect it . There is provision of five hundred pounds made expressly for this purpose . " " And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people  --  and the wine ! The wine  --  an outrage on all our principles ! Is there no way in which the dead may be shown respect without doing violence to the living ? " muttered Jason when Matthew 's name was announced . He flushed with annoyance and astonishment . " What 's the fellow doing here ? Decency at least might have kept him at a distance . There 's no reason for his hanging about , I take it ? " " None whatever , " said the lawyer precisely. 104 THE SUN IS MY UNDOING " If he comes cadging for money , you will inform him that the family acknowledges no claim on his behalf . My father was too good to him  --  a dissolute adventurer ! " said Jason viciously . " If it were n't that I wish to draw no more attention to his existence than need be , I 'd turn him out . " " There 'll be time enough for that after the funeral . And I think he will save you the trouble  --  after hearing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , concerning only myself and my dependants ! There is no need to make a public occasion of it . " " There are certain legacies  --  and I have received notification on behalf of your brother Jonathan that the legal firm which looks after his English interests is sending a representative to the funeral . This person , at least , will expect to be present , and it will be difficult to ignore your nephew 's claim as a member of the family . It is a form of gratificationwhich , if I may say so , you need not , in the circumstances , grudge , " said Clay dryly . " The sooner the whole business is over , the better I shall be pleased , " muttered Jason . His irritation was not soothed by coming face to face with Matthew , who , tired of the boxlike apartment in which he had been penned to await his interview , had lounged out into the office and , to the horror of the elder clerks and the immense entertainment of the younger ones , was tossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it 's drinks all round , " he had just informed the sniggering company when he found Jason at his elbow . " Well , well ! Making sure of your property , Uncle ? " he observed , cocking an eyebrow . Jason advanced a pace , glaring up at his enormous nephew . The contrast between the two was so ludicrous that one clerk , seized with a fit of tittering , exploded into a hiccup and was clouted out by his superior . " I shall be glad to know when you propose to leave Bristol . It may not have occurred to you that you are at present my guest ; I am not disposed to extend the hospitality indefinitely . " " Nor Ito claim it , " retorted Matthew . " I 've not got much to thank you for , Uncle Jason , and I have the less shame now when it suits my present convenience to be in your debt . But I fancy public opinion would condemn you if you were to turn me out before paying my last respects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , without pausing to be announced , thrustBRISTOL 105open the door through which Jason had just appeared from the partners ' sanctum . The little dry , bewigged figure of Mr. Cornelius Clay  --  senior partner of the firm of Clay , Hornbrook , and Clay , which had handled the Flood affairs for the better part of a century  --  turned in its chair , expressing with raised eyebrows and pursed lips its disapproval of this unbecoming entrance . Matthew was instantly aware that he had committeda solecism and proceeded to make up for it with an elaborate bow . " You must pardon my haste , sir ! But I am in Bristol only for a few days , and many affairs call for my attention , " he said boldly . Hercules Flood , he knew , was never one to waste time in kotowing to an attorney , but the frigid bow he received in return reminded him , as it was intended to do , of the gulf that separated his position from that of his grandfather . " I was not informed you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So the old snake knew all about him ? Jason 's version  --  or , perhaps , even more unfortunately , direct reports from town . Well , he had begun badly , so now let matters take their own course . " And if I had not , would that absolve you of courtesy ? " he retorted hotly . " I am no more accustomed than my grandfather , sir , to be kept waiting in your kennel until it is your pleasure to receive me . " " You are misinformed , Mr. Flood , " said the other coolly . " When your name was announced , I had a client with me . " " That might have been explained . " " It is explained now . You have business with me ? " " Yes . " Matthew 's resentment of the supercilious manner of the speaker scattered discretion to the winds . " I wish to know whether my name appears in my grandfather 's will . " " You are proposing , I take it , to attend the funeral ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will no doubt be present at the reading of the will , which will take place , as usual , at the conclusion of the obsequies . Good day , Mr. Flood . " " God damme , sir ! " Matthew exploded . " What right have you to treat me in this fashion ? I know , of course , that my relations have agreed to treat me as an outcast , and . would like to deny my right to share in any occasion that concerns the family . But that 's no damned business of yours ! I have a right to be as well informed as any upon aio6 THE SUN IS MY UNDOINGmatter which may affect my future . I shall be much obliged if you will inform me whether I may base any plans I may now have in mind upon my expectations from my grandfather 's will . " " In my opinion , such a course would be rash in the extreme . " " You mean , it would be totally unfounded ? " " Totally , Mr. Flood . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week of apprehension when , for Matthew , every lurking shadow harbouredan enemy and he went in hourly expectation of the arrival of his creditors  --  or of their representatives  --  and wondered what means to employ to persuade them to give him licence , at least until after the funeral . There could , he knew , be no more definite death-blow to his hopes in regard to Pallas than his arrest for debt here in a town that nourished its scandals and kept them alive from year to year . It was a foggy November afternoon , and Pallas , with the maid Betty in attendance , mounted Brandon Hill on an errand of charity . It was the girls ' old nurse who lived in a hut on the edge of the common , andthroughout the winters it was the custom of one or the other of them to pay a fortnightly visit with nourishment and odds and ends of warm clothing for old Mary , who stoutly refused to go into the almshouse . If Pallas 's heart beat faster as they approached the Flood boundaries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frost on the cobbles , and she and Betty clung together for mutual support ; mist hung the tree branches with globules of moisture , which congealed almost as soon as it formed , melted , dripped off , and formed again . " Let 's breathe for a moment ! " gasped Pallas , and if the place she had chosen for her rest happened to be the gates of Triton Lodge , it was no matter for comment , since it was just there that the ground began mounting sharply toward the crest of the hill and both were out of breath from their long walk . Between the great posts , each crowned with its fabulous stone monster , from which the house took its name , the broad drive wound up to the facade whose upper stories were just visible from where they stood ; no more than a shadow through the drifting mist it seemed to Pallas , shivering , more like a tomb than the home of living habitants . Under its balustraded roof a pharaoh , amidst his splendours , lay wait-107Io8 THE SUN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the drive was derelict with ice-skimmed mud and the black tangle of laurels that had crawled across the carriage-way since there was no one to care for them . " La , what a nasty , black fearsome hole ! " Betty was sniffing , with red-nosed resentment of the uncomfortable outing . " The lodge empty as well and half the windows broken ! I ca n't think how Mr. Matthew brings himself to sleep in such a bogy-ridden place . " " Do n't spy , Betty , " said Pallas sharply , " and come along ! I doubt we 'll get to old Mary 's at all , unless you stir yourself . " " I 'm sure if the mistress had known what it was like , she 'd have sent the coach , " Betty was complaining , and Pallas was just about to retort that exercise was exactly what she needed  --  being far too fat and broad in the beam for a young woman of twenty-four  --  when , with a squeal and a flounder , Betty 's feet shot from under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gutter by an arm which came out of the fog to drag her to a masculine bosom , while a voice which Pallas recognized , alas , too well , exclaimed , " Egad , it 's a bad fog that brings no one any good ! " and the sound of a smacking kiss betrayed the giver 's propensities where the female sex was concerned . " Oh , goodness mercy ! " gasped Betty , tearing herself away ; and at the same moment Matthew became aware of Pallas leaning against the gate-post , her hands in her muff , her eyes dancing at this revelation of her lover 's character . " Pallas  --  Miss Burmester ! " For once his self-assurance failed him . He made a movement toward her , from which she modestly withdrew , her eyes on her perturbed handmaid . " My maid is hardly used to such treatment , sir , on the part of my friends "  --  hut her voice trembled with laughter . " Perhaps you will kindly assist her in collecting the contents of our basket , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road . " " Damn the basket ! What are you doing with baskets , on a day like this ? " " Charity , sir , does n't wait upon the weather , " she mocked him . " All the same , I fear charity will have to wait for another day . " Her hands were locked tightly inside the concealing muff ; inwardly she was trembling . " We 're going home as fast as we can  --  make haste , Betty ; the fog 's getting thicker every minute , and I 'm afraid poor Mary must go without her soup , unless Mamma sends one of the men with it tonight . " BRISTOL 109The fog , indeed , was pouring in clouds across the shoulder of BrandonHill  --  partly sea-mist , partly the dank November brume that , in a few more minutes , would fill the valley and the town with its coiling and sinister presence . They could see it bearing down upon them like a great silvery sponge , floating in the humidity of the upper air , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little dismayed : for , to regain St. Michael 's Hill , they had either to cross Bullocks Park and the open fields or to take the longer but probably wiser course of running down to College Green , then up again to St. Michael 's . It was not often they got such fogs in Bristol , and she knew enough to recognize the unwisdom of continuing on her way . " You must take shelter in the house until it is over ! " " You know I can not ! " What Bristol fog could excuse such a departurefrom the conventions ? The most unblemished reputation could hardly be expected to survive ! She pressed the fur collar of her pelisse closer against her lips ; the fog stung tears to her eyes . " I must speak to you , if only for a moment . " He was bruising her arm with his grip . " Come  --  at least within the gate . " " Betty ! " she gasped . " Betty can wait in the lodge ; it is empty , but the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall we go ? " " Come , and I will show you . " He pulled her off the drive , into the shrubbery , which yet held off the encroaching wreaths of mist ; there was a narrow path between the sodden evergreens where the fallen leaves made papier mache under their feet ; it was nearly dark , and desperately cold , but both were burning . He brought her to a tiny pavilion , built after the Palladian style that was favoured by Georgian architects : a little domed temple , with gazebo windows in its circular walls . It was dank with cold , and smelt of dead leaves . " Are you afraid of bats ? There may be a bat or two . " " Not with my hood on , " she told him . There was a lantern , with a candle-end in it ; Matthew produced his tinder-box and kindled the flame ; their tiny cage revealed itself in dim orange light , the walls partly covered with a leprous damp , partly decorated with harps and flutes , with little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which Pallas , to spare her blushes , made comment . " What a pity that the damp has ruined the rest of the painting ! " IIO THE SUN IS MY UNDOINGMatthew told her . " It was an Italian painter who , most indiscreetly , fell in love with my grandmother before his work was completed ! Grandfather chased him out of town  --  no scandals for the Flood women ! " " Somebody has made a fire , " she commented , looking at the ash on the miniature hearth . " It was I ; the house is enough to drive one into melancholia , and I had some papers to read , which I brought out here . There is still a handful of sticks -- let us make ourselves comfortable . " He bent , his shadow bending with him , to rake together the remnants of the former fire , and she helped him , so that , suddenly , a little warmth broke from the embers . I-lc turned and took her hands . " This is what I have dreamed of . Pallas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time  --  to woo you as I desire . I love you . Do you love me ? " " Yes , " she answered , with a sobriety that made every pulse start in his body . " Will you be my wife ? " " Yes , " she replied , on the same calm note . They had no time to remark on the miracle of it or to indulge in those sweet , long-drawnoutecstasies of happier lovers . " I have nothing to give you . What about that ? I can make you no home at present . " " I will wait , " she comforted him . " God knows what the future holds . " " If it holds you , it is enough . " " My glorious Pally ! I am so hungry for you , I am almost mad : give me your lips . " As their mouths met , he felt her innocent craving toward him , and was sorely tempted to take some base advantage of her innocence , but as , in her presence , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he held hack ignoble desire , and , after that one deep , ineffable embrace , pressed her soft palms against his burning face . " I shall never love another woman , if I live to be a hundred ; what can I do to make your father believe it ? " " You are going to tell him ? " He felt her start . " What else can I do , dear love ? I must see him tonight  --  or tomorrow , if that will not do . Pally , Pally ! I never thought I had it in me to regret the past , but , by God , if by any sacrifice I could wipe out thatBRISTOL I I Irecord that stands against me , I 'd undertake it  --  if it meant the risk of my life . " " What good would that be to us , my love ? I want you living ! " The quivering ardour of her voice left no doubts of her sincerity . " Is there any doubt we were made for each other ? Pallas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I was made for a rogue , I needs must love him ! " she retorted . " You 'll hear some ugly things of me , Pallas ; what of those ? " He felt her head come up in a movement of pride . " At least I am free to believe as much , or as little , as I choose . " " My dear sweetheart ! I 'd sell my soul , not to wound you . " " God will help me to bear it , " she answered him simply . " Am I to have a religious wife ? " he teased her . " Should you mind  --  very much ? " " It is something so foreign to all my conceptions that I can hardly say ! " But the tightening of his arms took the sting out of the doubt . " You are no fool , Pally ; if you believe in a beneficent God , I 'm willing to admit there may be something in the idea , which , on the evidence of my senses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you find your God , sweetheart ? And how does it happen He does not warn you against a fellow like me ? " Yet in his tones rang the confidenceof his power over her , against a thousand gods . " I am so indifferent a Christian , " she . admitted , " that I am hardly able to say where I find my conviction of God 's existence , which , nevertheless , I believe in as I believe in my own . There 's certainly something in the world that works for our happiness  --  or you and I would not be together now  --  some power that is responsible for bringing people who love each other together " Even in such circumstances as these ! You are sure you do not suffer , my love , from this vile darkness and cold ? " The little fire of twigs had blackened on the hearth . " Not nearly so much as poor , miserable Betty , who must be sneezing her heart out  --  if she has n't perished with fright in that cold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ; I think we are both a little mad . At least no lovers ever plighted their troth in such inauspicious circumstances . " " I can not leave you two to find your way back alone . Damn Betty ! I suppose I shall have to take her on one arm and you on the other . " II2 THE SUN IS MY UNDOINGThe words were hardly out of his mouth when each heard a footfall , a rustling in the bushes that surrounded the little pavilion . Matthew had barely time to blow out the candle , and , thrusting Pallas behind him , to leap to the door , when the panting figure of Africa disengaged itself from the fog and the laurels . " What the devil do you here ? Who set you to spy on me , you black rascal ? " " I ain ' no spy , Mars ' Matthew !

For the last forty-eight hours he had been on tenterhooks , timing the arrival of the London coaches , trying to guess how long it would take his enemies to hunt him down . Yes , Jason would be the one to betray him . With what satisfaction he would give the view halloo to the hounds , not caring that the fox happened to be his own kith and kin ! Jail  --  disgrace  --  loss of Pallas . All the hideous future shot through his mind  --  the future they were to have shared .

There was possibility of escape in the fog  --  but whither ? And for how long ? He was again nearly penniless ; his horse was still lame , and Hercules ' animals , fat carriage beasts , were used only to dragging the heavy coach up and down the Gloucestershire hills . There was not a friend in the world to whom he could turn  --  unless it were to Abiathar , who would probably give him shelter and hide him for a day or two . But the hue and cry would be raised  --  unless he could find some means of placating these unwelcome visitors  --  and his reputation , such as it was , destroyed no less effectively than if he surrendered to justice . He turned roughly on Africa . BRISTOL I13 " Why did you let them in ? " " Could n't do not'ing else , Mars ' Matthew . Dere 's a big fella an ' a little one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I open de do ' , and folla pronto  --  ' fore Africa know what it was all about . " As Matthew strode into the hall , two bundled figures hoisted themselves from the settle on which they were sprawling . The hall was as cold as an icehouse , and they were muffled to the chin in shawls that , tucked partly into their greatcoats , gave a humped and sinister outline to their shoulders . The larger of the two advanced on Matthew , while the smaller , with a movement of practised agility , slid between him and the door . " Well , mister ! You need n't have given us all this trouble . " " Nor you me , " said Matthew coolly . " You have bad weather for your visit , gentlemen ; I do n't doubt the reason of it was urgent , for surely a clog would not choose to be abroad on such a day . As this is a somewhatpublic place , for the discussion of matters of business , perhaps you will accompany me to more comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience had taught him paid best with birds of this feather . " We ai n't here for discussions , " grunted the big fellow , whose height , as Matthew observed , was but an inch or so less than his own ; he was as broad as a barn door , and bore the empurpled and bellicose aspect of one accustomed to enforce persuasion by physical power . " You know what we come for , mister , and the less fuss made , the more agreeable for all parties . " " I take it , " said Matthew , " you are representing my friends in town , whose friendship seems less powerful than their anxiety about their money ! " " You guessed it ; and we got the warrant for your ' rest , so you 'd better come along quiet , if you do n't want no bother , Mr. Flood . " The movement he made toward Matthew was , however , checked by the latter 's expression , which , although smiling , was not such as to invite rash action on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast , " said Matthew quietly ; " and , by the way , do me the favour to remove your hats . I 'm not given to formalities , but my grandfather lies dead in this house and , till his body is removed , I exact the respect due to his remains . " They looked at each other uneasily , as though suspecting a trick ; the smaller sullenly dragged off his hat . I14 THE SUN IS MY UNDOING BRISTOL I15 " Your hat ? " smiled Matthew at the taller fellow , and swaggered toward the door of the dining-room . " Here  --  where arc you off to ? " growled the latter , dogging him , but with his hat in his hand . " I have a taste for privacy , in matters of this kind , " said Matthew carelessly ; " and a good oak door is the best security I know against the betrayal of secrets . " The candles were lighted , and he did not fail to remark the effect which his surroundings made upon his companions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hercules who stood at the side- board , with a decanter in either hand , save that Hercules , his grandson was persuaded , had never found himself in any such uncomfortable situation as the present . " Here , as you may perceive , is the best Jamaica rum , and here a cognac of excellent quality , either of which is grateful upon a winter 's day . Permit me to offer you some solace for the un- timely mission upon which you are come ! " " ' Tai n't no use , " mumbled the little man , who had been quick to follow his companion 's lead , and Matthew , into the room . " The sooner the job 's clone , the better . " " Hold yer gob ! " the other prompted him , and jerked his head toward the decanter of rum . " Now then , mister , what 's your game ? You know there ai n't no bribing of His Majesty 's officers . " He tossed back two- thirds of the tumbler Matthew passed him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while his little eyes , sunk under their sprouting brows , followed each of Matthew 's movements . Matthew threw a glance at the Sevres clock on the mantelpiece : he sought only to make sure that Pallas and Betty , in Africa 's charge , were far enough down the hill to be beyond danger of overtaking . " Bribery is hardly a word to be spoken in polite society , " he said lightly ; he passed the bright bubble of glass containing the cognac reflectively beneath his nose before tasting its contents . " But friendly arrangements cone into another category ! You have come a long way , on a disagreeable errand , to a town which , I fear , is little likely to afford you entertainment . Bristol , gentlemen , is a seaport  --  a fact which can hardly have escaped your attention  --  and the amusements . it offers are little to the taste of Londoners . In fact , the sole virtue of the place is that it represents the gateway to  --  the unknown ! How many of our ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boundaries of your and my imagination ! How many who have watched their departure have felt the thrill of envy for those , more fortunate , who exchange the troubles and responsibilities of a life ashore for the careless tranquillity of an ocean voyage ! " " Eh ? " said the little man stupidly ; the other drank deep from the tumbler he did not seem inclined to let out of his hand . " Supposing you 'd got here too late ? Supposing I 'd bolted  --  was on the high seas ? That precious document of arrest would n't have been much use to you or to your employers ! " said Matthew persuasively . " T is a contingency that might well have arisen , and for which you could not have been held to blame . " There was a pregnant silence ; he had no hope that the argument would succeed ; even supposing the fellows were open to bribery , what had he to offer them ? There was only his last hope  --  Shergill , whose somewhat fulsome promises might , or might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he might find some temporary way out of this impasse . " You ai n't on the high seas , " growled the big fellow , setting down his emptied glass , " so take advice as is well meant , mister , and surrenderyourself without further ado . We got our instructions to take you in custody for debt . " " Keep off , if you please , " said Matthew , with dangerous quietness . " This comedy has gone on long enough , for my liking ! There is a mistake , gentlemen , of which I 'll leave my lawyer to persuade you . Inhospitable as it may seem to turn you out of doors on such a night , I 'm afraid there is nothing for it but for you to pay a visit to Mr. Thomas Shergill , in King Street , who will give you all the satisfaction you desire . As you are strangers here , it will give me pleasure to offer you conduct down to the town . " " Come on , Spears , " said the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ? " " If you have , " said Matthew , detaching his shoulders from the man-elpiece , against which they had been indolently posed , " I strongly advise you to keep them in your pockets . " The mask of geniality dropped , he faced them , and it was plain that he was prepared to resist any attempt to curtail his liberty . " It has n't escaped your notice , I imagine , that I could crack your heads together about as easily as I could crack a walnut ? " " Well , then , you 'd swing , " said the little man cheerfully ; he seemed the bolder of the two . " Now , do n't be unreasonable , mister , we 're only doing our dooty. " i16 THE SUN IS MY UNDOING " I 'm not unreasonable in insisting that you should make sure of your grounds before putting your order into execution . I will accompany you , if you choose , " said Matthew , seeing from the clock that Pallas and her companion must be well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him his travelling-cloak ; " And plague on you , " he muttered , " for offering this inconvenience to a gentleman ! " As the little man moved up nearer , " Hands off , " he added , " or , by God , I 'll let daylight into both of you ! " " Hands off while you dodge away in the dark , is that it ? " snarled the other , taking an evidently hesitant step toward Matthew . " You fool ! " said Matthew . " If I 'd anywhere to dodge to , do you suppose I 'd not have gone before now ? " IILawyer Shergill 's office -- it surprised his new clients to find  --  was furnished more like a shipping than a legal office ; the panelling was hung with prints and a few crude paintings of every kind of ship , from the China clipper to the brigantine , while a collection of rough drawings , obviously by an amateur hand , recorded a variety of native and obsolete craft  --  polacre , lorcha , bucentaur , coracle , galleass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identified by a neat label at the foot of the sheet . On a table stood a fine scale model of a Spanish first-rate , and on Shcrgill 's desk , among the confusion of his papers , a smaller , threemastedmodel under process of reparation . There was enough seatackleabout the place to furnish a cutter ; it covered deed boxes and bundles of documents loaded with dusty seals , giving eloquent proof of the real trend of its owner 's interests . Since three of the afternoon the candles had been lighted , and shed their wavering light upon the immense , crouching figure that bent over the little three-master , manipulating , with fingers as delicate as pliers , blocks hardly bigger than a grain of mustard seed , and filaments of cotton that made spider's-web among the spars . It was the passion of Shergill 's life , this collection and reparation of ship-models , and the inclemency of the weather , which kept away clients , was welcomed by him as an opportunity of devoting more time than usual to his favourite occupation . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subdued his second passion  --  the port bottle which stood , its neck encrusted with dirt and glue , at his elbow . Until he had finished , heBRISTOL 117would not risk a blunder that might ruin his precious handiwork , from which he extracted the pleasure a woman gets from her needle . In the outer office , the older clerks slept and the apprentices played dice for halfpence . There was never much to occupy them in Shergill 's office , which he had inherited from an obstinate old father who lived to be a hundred and would never listen to his son 's frequently expressed longing to be allowed to go to sea . He had fortunately left a sufficient fortune to enable " young Tom , " as he insisted on calling him when his son was well over sixty , to be independent of a business for which he had so little taste though not a little ability ; and it was partly indolenceand partly indifference which had prevented Shergill from selling it when it came into his own hands . That , and the shipowners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a position to manipulate the law in one 's own favour , and Hercules Flood was not the only person who had found it convenient to have a lawyer on his board of owners . A member , like Hercules , of the Merchant Adventurers ' Company , and almost as deeply involved as he in shipping ventures , Shergill was wont to declare that the sea had served him better than a lifetime of law , quoting his bankers in support of the statement . He was regarded as one of the soundest men in Bristol from a financial point of view , and if there were a few who took exception to Tom 's methods of doing business , there were more who were satisfied to shut one eye in anticipation of the advantages to themselves to be gained by a convenient blindness . He was disgruntled when the jangle of the outer office bell announced the arrival of a visitor . Peering through his window , which overlooked the street , darkness and fog alike prevented him from seeing who was likely to disturb his occupation . Devil take ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an afternoon when every civilized human being was huddled over his hearth . " Who ? " he snapped at the clerk who opened the door . " Mr. Matthew Flood , sir , and two other gentlemen . " " Come you in , my boy ! " he roared , thrusting his spectacles up on his brow and wiping his hands down the sides of his breeches , which already were deplorable with grime accumulated in his present occupation . Young Flood  --  it had been in his mind to send for him this night , but that mizzen stay-sail had sent it right out of his mind ! Still , providence looked after one 's business , if one had not time to do it for oneself . He creased his ponderous belly in a bow , as Matthew , immenseI18 THE SUN IS MY UNDOINGin his fog-misted cloak , strode into the room , followed by two persons whose profession the astute lawyer spotted at a glance . " No need to apologize to friends for my unprofessional occupation ! How are ye , my dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No friends of mine , " said Matthew with a glance at the closed door . " To put it bluntly , these fellows have come to arrest me for debt , and , bearing in mind your friendly offer of a day or two ago , I thought it possible you 'd help me to meet the situation . " III " My dear boy , all I ask is you should regard me in loco parentis ! " Shergill was saying an hour later . " As I barely remember my parents , sir , I 'm not sure of the correct procedure ! " Matthew 's lips curved into a thin smile . " But to judge of my acquaintances , who are not similarly bereaved , the usual approach seems to be a request for money ! " Cradling his belly on his clasped hands , and closing his eyes , Shergill nodded like a bonze , but his lips tightened . He had already taken a risk , an enormous risk . " Proceed  --  proceed . " " You made me yesterday , " blurted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , considering the fact that , however paternal your sentiments may be , sir , you are not my father and have no reason to be so accommodating ! Perhaps my reception of your offers was a little brusque ; if so , I apologize . My experience of life has been  --  a hard one , and , to speak frankly , I 'm not used to receiving such offers from strangers . As : t man of the world , you 'll appreciate the doubts that were in my mind ; doubts , I may say , that your assistance this evening has gone a long way to dispel . " " Tt-tt . Your grandfather and I were best friends from the day we was breeched . " " Mr. Shergill , " said Matthew , " I 'm no fool , and my knowledge of mankind does n't increase my belief in philanthropy  --  more especially , if you 'll excuse my saying so , from members of your profession . Why are you interesting yourself in my affairs ? You 're not , I take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortune , according to how you handle it . I ai n't one , sir , toBRISTOL 119hoard my means or to sink ' em in securities to benefit my descendants . Why should I , seeing I 've no descendants but a poor gal that , so far as I can see , ai n't likely to make a grandfather of me ? Circulate your money  --  circulate it ! I learned that from your grandfather . Tom , ' he says to me , the law wo n't keep you in ' bacca . ' ' T was he put me in the way of better business , and if I see fit to pay my debts through one of his blood " Matthew 's gesture waved this fantasy aside . " You put me out of the way while you were dealing with those two rascals , " he said ( he had been invited by Shergill to step into the adjoiningroom when the position had been explained , and although the connectingdoor was left ajar  --  presumably on the demand of his would-be jailers  --  the mumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch . He had not failed , however , to observe the deference with which the two saluted him when Shergill ushered them past him , into the street ) . " Sc I have no means of knowing what passed between you ; but I have sufficient experience of these unpleasant gentry to know that the settlementof my affairs must to some degree have involved your personal credit . Is n't it time we had an understanding ? I naturally want to know the extent of my commitments  --  of my debts  --  to you ; though it 's only fair to add that my present prospects of discharging them are so slight as hardly to be worth discussion ! " " Damme , sir , you 're Hercules ' grandson . Ai n't that enough for you ? " " Yes , yes . Do n't forget I come of commercial stock ! What do you think you 're going to get out of it ? " Shergill 's eyes vanished in the wrinkles of his silent laughter . " No use urging the claims of sentiment on you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you ai n't the toughest of the lot . ' T is a serviceable quality , but it needs supplementing . A streak o ' romance , my boy , a streak o ' romance . ' T was strong in your grandfather ; do n't tell me it 's been left out of your system . " " As a practical man , " muttered Matthew , sullen as a hunting dog at being diverted from his object , " I 've little use for the romantic  --  which is a luxury of the well-to-do . " " Ah , there you 're wrong ! Romance , my boy , can be your strongest ally , so long as you govern it with common sense . Romance is the imagination , the reaching-beyond , that makes all the difference between a great man of business and a little one . It 'd surprise you , maybe , I20 THE SUN IS MY UNDOINGto hear a lawyer describe himself as a romantic ? Well , there you are "  --  he pointed to the little ship . " There 's romance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've never wanted another . " " Happy the man who can combine his pleasures with his profits ! But " " Shall I tell you how it is with a ship ? " pursued Shergill , relentless upon the track of his hobby . " I 'll tell you . A ship fills all your waking and sleeping hours with divine uncertainty . The wind shifts , and you wonder if she 's in its track ; you see the north star from your window , and think of the helmsman setting his course by its light ; news comes of a wreck , and you shiver for the cargo that stands for the better part of your fortune . There 's not an hour of the day or night that your soul 's in peace , till she comes up the river  --  maybe with her bulwarks patched , and some damned corsair 's cannonball lodged in her bows ! " Matthew drew a deep breath and his hands clutched his kneecaps ; for an instant he closed his eyes . He too had dreamed of these things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He returned to the attack . " I put it straight to you . Has grandfather left me anything ? " Shergill drained and replenished his glass before replying . " Clay 's got the will , ai n't he ? He 's the proper person to ask . " " If he is , it 's evident you know something . " Ignoring a movement of deprecation , he continued , " And you 're not the only one . The tale 's round Bristol that Jason 's not got all he expected . " Shcrgill 's eyes went to the door ; he cleared his throat , and raised his voice as he answered , " Tt-tt . Is that what they 're saying ? Well , there ai n't a few 'd be gratifiedto hear of his disappointment . An unpop'lar fella ; a damned unsociable , psalm-singing fella ; damme if I know how Hercules begat him  --  or t'othcr , that 's in the Indies . Do you ever have news of your uncle Jonathan ? " Matthew consigned his uncle Jonathan to perdition . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That your grandfather 's left you money ? " The big , bladderlike head rolled doubtfully . " Harries ! " he bawled , and a little old man came shambling through the door ; he had been a clerk with Shergill 's father , and decades of association with the law had dried his skin to the colour of old parchment ; his eyes were pin-points in the cross-hatching of the innumerable lines that charted his narrow face . " Harries , you hear allBRISTOL I2Ithat goes on in Bristol : have ye heard any tales about Mr. Hercules ' will ? " Harries moved his head faintly ; his lips moved as though they grudged the utterance of each syllable . " No . " " Nothing new  --  nothing unexpected ? All right ; you can send the others home  --  and fetch me the keys before you go . " While a clatter of feet and banging of disk-lids and doors went on in the outer office , Shergill told Matthew : " I know of a will your grandfather made seven or eight years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jason was in his good graces . And mind ye  --  no wonder ! The year he took over , the gross profits ran to nine thousand over the top figure in previous balances . A few years later , he tripled ' em . Hercules liked that ; it helped to make up for having a son he could n't in his heart abide . He told me several times he 'd misjudged Jason , and he 'd have to find a way of showing he was sorry , sorry  --  do you get me ?  --  for hating his own flesh and blood . He 'd always refused to take Jason into partnership , and it was a sore point between ' em , though Jason was too sly to harp on it . " " Have you any notion what Grandfather was worth ? " " At a hazard  --  between three and four hundred thousand ; maybe more , maybe less . It 'll be a difficult will to prove  --  good night , Tomkins  --  because all Hercules ' ventures was n't , as you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have people know what he was doing . ' Twas n't the timberyard alone ; it was his private interests , that only a few of us shared . " ' God above ! " groaned Matthew . " And the whole of it goes to that creeping Jesus ! " " Good night , Hawkes ; good night , Simmons , " said Shergill to the clerks , who tipped their hats to him from the door . " Mind you , he regretted it . He and Jason did n't get friendlier as time went on , and I 've heard him swear , if it was n't for the business , he 'd leave the lot to charity . He went so far , he told me , as to put in a codicil or two  --  Burmesterand Peddy and me , we were all to have something for the sake of old times . And Burmester 's wife , she was in it : Hercules always had a soft spot for Lyddie Casamajor , that was  --  and if he 'd had his way , young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribs with the snuffbox the latter had just refused , " she 'd have been your mother , I22 , THE SUN IS MY UNDOINGinstead of the poor , pretty Merlyn lass . Lyddie 's a damned fine woman , with a damned fine daughter  --  mater pulchrd filia pulchrior  --  you must meet Miss Pallas ! All the young fellas in Bristol after her  --  but her mother married late ; they say she was waiting for James . " " Plague take you for a drivelling old fool ! " Matthew was thinking as Harries shuffled in with the keys ; he and Shergill performed what was evidently a nightly ceremony that Matthew watched with impatience : Shergill poured out two glasses of port , which employer and employee drank in silence , then , with an equally silent handshake and a tip of the hat to Matthew , the old man tottered to the door . Shergill winked at his visitor . " Part of me inheritance . A queer bird , ai n't he ? Never knew Harries to use two words where one would do ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the palm of his hand and saves me a deal o ' bother . " " Well , if that 's all you know about Grandfather 's will , " said Matthew , rising , " I need n't trouble you further . I suppose I must resign myself  --  there 's no point in denying that , notwithstanding your assistance , I am in the very devil of a mess . " Shergill had opened the door into the outer office , which the old man had closed behind him , and was raising a candle above his head , as though to assure himself that all was in order , before leaving it for the night . " Aye , so it would appear , " he agreed , and , holding the candle between himself and Matthew , seemed to scrutinize the latter 's face . " What 'd you do in my place ? " asked Matthew bluntly . Shergill thrust out his lower lip , as though considering . " There 's but one way to get back lost money , that I know of , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more money after it . " " A simple solution  --  on the face of it ! And supposing you 've got no more to send ? " " What 's in your mind ? " " Supposing I turn the question back on you ? You 've pledged yourself , I take it , liberally , on my account . Your prospects of recovery are small . What do you propose , to protect yourself ? " Instead of answering , Shergill closed and , to Matthew 's surprise , locked the inner door ; then , with his rolling gait , crossing to the window , closed the shutters upon the foggy darkness that pressed close to the windowpanes . The clock over the mantelpiece  --  a fine old ship 's timepiece in a brass case  --  told the hour of seven as he produced from aBRISTOL I23cupboard a series of bottles and , with Matthew 's assistance , proceeded to the mixing of a bowl of punch . The steam of the boiling kettle , the rich , aromatic flavour of the brew , absorbed , apparently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickened by anxiety , knew now there was more to come : that he must bear with these antics of pro --  crastination for the sake of what lay behind . Shergill ladled the punch into two vast goblets of Bristol glass and raised his own with a solemnity that communicated itself to his com- panion and roused in him excitement and apprehension of he knew not what . " Your very good health , sir . I fear I 've tried your patience , " he chuckled , as he allowed his gross bulk to settle in a chair , " in the last hour or so ! But it 's true that walls  --  even the walls of a lawyer 's office  --  have ears , and maybe I 'm overprecautious . It 's a trick one learns in our business . . . well , well . And I owe you an apology , my boy , for me defection of the night before last , when you were to have been my guest at dinner " Matthew waved this aside with as much politeness as impatience allowed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Shergill . " Old Ortright has obliged me by dying ' reg'lar over the last fifteen or twenty year . I 've got a plaguy curious woman in my household , and one 's got to prepare one 's excuses . I never went near Ortright 's ; I rode over to see me old friend and col- league Fortune , that 's retired from the bar to a very pretty property t' other side of Brislington Hill . There 's no man living knows more than he o ' the twists and turns of the law , and I 'm indebted to him for many a piece of good advice that 's been of service to me and me clients . To speak plain "  --  he hawked , and a gob of spittle sizzled in the red heart of the fire  --  " I was n't the only one last Sunday night that was n't in full possession of his faculties  --  though I 'd not admit as much to anyone save you and me old friend Fortune  --  and I 'd scratched my head a-plenty over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the tips of his fingers were crisping toward the palms , and he sat forward on the edge of his chair . " Cruikshank 's name 's good enough , but I 'd as lief that t' other had n't been Sam Rogers , that ca n't read the alphabet nor make a decent cross when it comes to signature ; and ' t was on that point I approached For-124 THE SUN IS MY UNDOINGtune  --  not wishing to raise hopes that might be doomed to disappoint on some little piddling point o ' jurisprudence  --  " The silence throbbed ; a coal dropped and broke into glowing embers on the hearth . Matthew 's heart was thudding against his breastbone . Shergill heaved sideways in his chair , and producing , with a convulsion , from his breeches pocket a bunch of keys , thrust one into the desk at his elbow . With movements of agonizing slowness , he shuffled through a batch of papers ; produced , at last , the one he sought . " For your sake , my boy , " he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orderly , for ' t is folly to deny there 'll be a mort o ' prejudice surrounding the circumstances , and yer uncle Jason ai n't likely to give in without a struggle . All the same  --  " He heaved and shook himself to his feet , and the hand that came to rest on Matthew 's shoulder conveyed more conviction , through its heavy , trembling pressure , than the paper he placed between the latter 's shaking fingers . CHAPTER IXI7 HEY buried Hercules Flood at eight of the night on the Fridayfollowing his death , and , judged even by Bristol standards , it was a bumper funeral . Since the first streak of a pale primrose dawn , the city and waterways  --  where every ship carried its flag at half-mast  --  had echoed with the tolling of bells , and , when darkness stole upon the belfries , the faint gleam of lantern-light , slotting their sides with yellow , told of the ringers ' fortitude , while the great bells still swung overhead , launching their dolorous message from parish to parish and drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendous pomps with which a Flood was laid to rest . The fog had cleared , and from Brislington to Brandon Hill the flame if the torches traced the progress of the cortege as it came creaking , slipping , and lurching down Park Street , to cross the harbour , whose waters blazed for a moment smoky red with the reflected flambeaux , accompanied by the shrill , uneven chant of the Redcliffe scholars who beaded the procession . These , as it moved into the town , paid less atten-t ion to their singing than to the stones with which they slyly lined the pockets of their gowns ; for , in accordance with the disgraceful custom of the times , the rabble which poured from the alleys to witness the spectacle soon started to break through its escort , to snatch at the rich adornments of the hearse . By the time the vast catafalque had reached the Redcliffe hill , there were few remaining of the tassels of bullion , silvered wreaths , and other adornments that had blazoned the heavy black velvet pall when it left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused by the plunging of the horses , which , alarmed by the stone-throwing of the Redcliffe boys , took all the coachman'sskill to control them and to prevent the hearse and its contents from being flung into the gutters . The coachman , blood running down125I26 THE SUN IS MY UNDOINGhis cheek from a cut under one eye , wig and tricorne gone , stood up on his box , lashing and cursing profusely ; Matthew and Ralph Burmester , riding one on either side of the hearse , swung and spurred their horses on the mob , but the mob was agile and determined . Such affairs as these were part of their perquisites , and it would have taken cannon to disperse them . They cheerfully risked trampling to death for the chance of securing a scrap of the precious metals that would assure them their share in the funeral celebrations ; a few of the more drunken and shameless even snatched at the plumes wobbling between the horses ' cars , and mopped and mowed like savages in the torchlight ; with these epicedial adornments thrust into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mob booed their disapproval of these antics but took no measures against them ; were they not part of every important funeral , and of the spectacle they had all come out to see ? There would be a few arrests , and the magistrates would have a busier time than usual in the morning ; meanwhile , as the procession moved on , every eye was riveted upon the coaches , of which there were more than fifty , a dearth of black horses being atoned for by the ponderoussable caparisons that concealed most of the piebald , the chestnut , and the grey . In the first of the coaches , Jason and his family invested the occasion with all appropriate melancholy by a display of black-bordered linen handkerchiefs ; the second held , in solitary state , Jonathan 's representative , a little , shiny-skinned , tight-lipped person , to be identified at fifty yards as a member of the legal profession . The third , from whose windowspoured such volumes of smoke that it was thought at one moment to be alight and a cry of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Teddy , Tom Shergill , and the Cruikshanks , all burning the incensehe loved best to the memory of old Hercules and enlivening the tedium and discomfort of the journey with the pipes which provided a smoke-screen for their private sentiments . And so on and so forth  --  includingall the guilds , societies and companies in which Hercules had interests  --  the coaches trailed far away into the night , followed on foot by workmen , apprentices , and the old men from the Flood almshouses , in suits of new black . It is to be hoped that the reluctant limbs of the last-named were rendered more elastic by the prospect of the refreshmentwhich awaited them at the end of their journey . But the main interest of the procession  --  at least from the feminine point of view  --  centered in the figure which rode on the left of theBRISTOL I27hearse . Matthew Flood 's return was by now known throughout the town , and the attention of all to whom it was not already familiar was greedily riveted upon that high , imperious profile which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some fashion that went deep into the consciousness of many of the onlookers the might , majesty , and power for which the name of Flood had so long stood in Bristol . It was generally considered a pity that Matthew should not continue to representit . Not a few  --  particularly among Jason 's friends  --  took as an act of insolence this public assumption of rights that belonged to the heir ; but Jason could hardly have ridden , had he chosen ; he was a wretched horseman , never trusting himself except to the spavined nag , too spiritlessto give trouble , that bore him on his business rounds . It was remarkedthat Jason 's face at the coach window was as vicious as a rat 's as he observed the interest roused by Matthew 's action . Yet it was with no insolent intent that Matthew had chosen to ride . His relationships with his family being what they were , the question of his accompanying them in the coach had not arisen ; nor ( lid he care for the alternative of sharing the second coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he who had persuaded Ralph Burmester to share with him the duties of mounted escort , partly in order that his own part might not be too conspicuous , partly because he had been warned of the barbarities that usually accompanied Bristol funerals . Ralph , an excellent horseman , had accepted stiffly , though not without gratification , the office which Matthew suggested , only stipulating that the matter should be submitted to Jason for his approval before giving his final assent ; and Jason , not knowing of the second escort , had lugubriously tendered his thanks for the offer . As he rode magnificently mounted upon a tall black horse , his cloak of sable velvet , lined and faced with stiff satin , spread across its hindquarters , the ribbons and crop gathered into his left hand and the right resting lightly , as though by accident , upon the hilt of his sword , Matthew 's face , by the light of the torches , was remembered by many . Still as marble , white except for the black bar of his brows , stiff in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a death-mask . Even in attacking the sacrilegious rabble , it never altered ; there was something inhuman and frightful in that stone-cold face as he spurred his horse onto its hindlegs , to strike at the mob with its flashing hoofs ; the blade in his hand was the more terrible for being wielded so passionlessly . I28 THE SUN IS MY UNDOING The service took a long time ; the oration , pronounced by Bishop Yonge , even longer . The great Flood vault yawned to receive the mor- tal remains of another of its tenants , while the lights of candles twin- kled all over the graveyard , packed from end to end with the motionless and silent throng . Down the Redcliffe hill one could have walked on the heads of the people as , between earth and stars , floated the last , sweet dirge of the choristers , that ended with the last note of the bells . II As it was manifestly impossible for many of the huge gathering to make their way back to Brandon Hill , the mourners repaired to Jason 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was constrained , by the terms of the instructions left to Clay , no less than by public opinion , to conform to the ceremonial of Hercules ' circle ; and , for the first and only time during the Jason Floods ' tenancy , the usually meagre board groaned with victuals reluctantly provided in accordance with what was expected at the funeral of a city father . It must have taken a degree of imperviousness to do full justice to that lavish entertainment with Jason at the head of the board , sour as a green apple and jealously resentful of every glass emptied and refilled ! It is sad to relate that even some of the " brethren , " tempted beyond their strength by the luscious scents of sucking pig , of boiled turkey and lark pie , forsook their sworn abstemiousness , to engage as deeply as any in the lusts of the palate . Deference to a reluctant host was forgotten as the wine gained power over minds and muscles , and as it became in- creasingly apparent that authority was slipping from his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he did so , the eye of Clay , who rose and followed him to the door . " In the name of decency , let this be finished as soon as possible ! Ca n't the will be read now ? " " Certainly , Mr. Flood . I will advise the one or two whom it concerns and join you presently . " " We shall be upstairs in the parlour , " muttered Jason as he stepped into the hall , whose blaze of unwonted light stabbed him anew in his economies . As he closed the door , Matthew rose from the chest on which he had been seated . He looked down at his uncle , and , for once , there was nothing either insolent or mocking in his gaze . " Uncle , I should like a word with you . " " I have nothing whatever to say to you , " snapped Jason . BRISTOL 129 " Uncle , " said Matthew again , " God knows there is no reason for me to consider your feelings , any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence during the last week has been sufficient of an outrage , " babbled Jason , " and any talk of consideration on your part can be no more than vain protestation , so far as I and my family are concerned ! I am informed that I can not forbid you to be present at the will-reading . " " In that case , " broke in Matthew , " there is nothing more to be said . I will only ask you to remember that I would have spared you  --  something  --  ifI could . " Jason stared after the tall figure that strode out into the dark , slammingthe door behind it . Was the fellow not going to hear the will read , after all ? He felt some annoyance , almost as much as he had felt on hearing that Matthew insisted upon his family rights ; it had pleased him , in one way , to imagine him sitting there , swallowing his bile , while the terms of the will underlined his exclusion from the benefits of the house of Flood . Ann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ! the dimly lighted parlour , looked up as the head of the family entered ; a pathetic trio , their red eyes were heavy with sleep . The prospect of riches meant nothing to Ann save her lust for charity ; Miss Amelia and Miss Michal , poor girls , could not be expected to rejoice in a fortune which would bring little to them beyond an extension of their almsgivingactivities . " Do you think Papa would allow me to buy just one new gown ? " Michal had whispered wistfully ; she was not yet as resignedas her sister to the demands of religion . Amelia shook her head decidedly . " You should know Papa better , Sister , than to think he would encourage us in useless frivolity , " she retorted severely . Lawyer Clay entered , followed by a little company , which was stiffly acknowledged by the family . " Allow me , ladies , to present Mr. Jernigan , of the firm Rice , Jernigan , and Grylls , of London  --  representing the interests of Mr. Jonathan Flood , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added , " Mr. Shergill , whom you know , tells me he has been instructed by Mr. Matthew Flood to be present on his account . " Jason bit back an exclamation , nodding coldly . Shergill , in his opinion , was one of the least desirable of his father 's acquaintances : just the one , no doubt , whom Matthew would choose to add to the affront of130 THE SUN IS MY UNDOINGhis own presence . Shergill was bowing blandly , seemingly unaware of the fact that he was unwelcome , removing the traces of his interrupted meal from the front of his waistcoat . His rolling gait carried him to the fireplace , where he allowed his bulk to fall into the armchair which Clay had intended for his own occupation . Clay glared ; Shergill bowed and smiled . The others found their places with varying degrees of diffidence in distanter parts of the room ; Ralph Burmester was there , on his wife 's account ; he knew there was nothing for him in the will . Peddy and Fordyce avoided each other 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were notorious for their curiosity , were representedby the elder ; Simon , to his brother 's mystification , had pleaded sudden illness and hurried home to bed . A profound hush fell upon the company as Lawyer Clay opened his briefcase to extract the fateful document . A fussy man , loving formalities , he took as long as possible about it , blowing his nose , clearing his throat , altering the position of candles , and settling his coat-tails in so prolonged a fashion that Tom Shergill , sunk in his flesh , but less at ease than his appearance suggested , was moved to grunt : " You need n't draw it out so long , Clay ; there 's no more company coming . " " I had not expected any , Mr. Shergill ! " retorted the other , glaring over the tops of his spectacles . " Your pardon . I thought maybe you were waiting for my client  --  who 's decided not to be present . " " We are waiting for no one , Mr. Shergill , " emphasized Jason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reading of the fateful document . It was impossible , even for those who were prepared , not to be impressed by the formidable record of Hercules Flood 's fortune , which exceeded in bulk Shcrgill 's previous estimate . The will took the better part of an hour to read , though the charitable bequests were fewer and smaller than those customary among Bristol testators , and Lawyer Clay found it necessary to remind his audience that the late Mr. Flood 's beneficence during his lifetime was so well known that it was unnecessaryto comment on the relatively small sums he had dedicated to postmortemcharities . The personal bequests were even fewer , and obviously dictated by sentiment rather than with the intention of benefiting the receivers . BRISTOL 131John Peddy and Tom Shergill ( " my oldest friends " ) were to receive each the sum of five hundred pounds , " in memory of our ventures . " To Lydia Burmester was left a quantity of jewellery , " the property of my late wife  --  since I have no daughter to inherit , and it is inconceivable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that flesh they profess to despise ! " If a tear dropped into poor Miss Michal 's lap , no one observed it , and she covered it quickly with her handkerchief . " The remainder and bulk of my fortune is left to my son Jason , in consideration of his estimable labours on the company 's behalf , and for the upkeep and extension of the business in which he has shown so far a sagacity which I advise him to apply to his private affairs . " " Is that all ? " questioned Jason sharply , after silence had fallen . " That is all , Mr. Flood ; permit me to congratulate you , and to wish you all happiness and fortune in your new estate , " said Clay fussily . There were murmurs of acquiescence in this well-wishing ; Jason stood silent , biting his thumb . All turned toward Shergill as he came lumbering to his feet , wiping , a trifle ostentatiously , traces of moisture from his eyes . " It is no more than natural  --  I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by our old friend 's token of regard ! ' T is not the gift itself , but the wish that sweetens the gift , " he declared , beaming on the assembly , which was slow to respond to his sentiments , for it was well known in Bristol that when Lawyer Tom evoked sentiment he was most dangerous . Even Ralph Burmester looked suspiciously toward the bulky figure , which as though by accident had assumed the middle of the floor . " Perhaps , sir , you will allow me , on my client 's behalf , to put a question . " " I deny my nephew 's right to ask questions ! " snapped out Jason , to be rebuked by a lift of his lawyer 's eyebrows . " Your question , sir ? " " On my client 's behalf , sir , I should be obliged if you would quote me the date of the will you have just read . " " The date of the will , " said Clay coldly , " is the eleventh day of May , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three previous wills , made respectively in the years " Never mind the years , " said Shergill , and drew his hand out of his pocket ; a cold hush fell upon the assembly . " For the will I have here , made on November the sixth , in the year 176o , revokes all  --  I say all  --  the others . " 132 THE SUN IS MY UNDOINGA scream came from Ann Flood . Jason , crouching , clutching the mantelpiece like one who fears to fall , cried out : " What is this trickery ? " " Nay , nay , there 's no trickery , " wheezed Shergill , fumbling in his turn with the paper . " Signed , sealed , and witnessed , as you 'll observe , this will was made by my old friend Hercules Flood , in full possession of his wits and faculties  --  as Fordyce there is prepared to vouch for . " " That , by heaven , is a lie ! For the last twelve months we have sought , on account of my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Sought ? But you did n't get it , did you ? And ' twill be difficult to prove ' failing intelligence , ' with a dozen witnesses to swear the contrary . D' you remember , Burmester , ' The Scarlet-coloured cock , my lord likes best  --  ' ? Does a man of ' failing intelligence ' quote a dozen lines of verse , without a single breakdown ? " " I prefer , " said Ralph coldly , " not to be asked for my opinion . " " Egad , " sniggered Cruikshank , " I do n't mind giving mine ! If Hercules ' intelligence was wanin , ' then clap me in a strait-jacket and take me to Bedlam ; for I was no more sane than he . " " Gentlemen ! The discussion of these questions may be left to the future . " Jealous of his authority , Lawyer Clay had risen , with a dark flush in his cheeks , to face Shergill . " I presume my worthy colleague " the tone converted the words into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contents of his so-called will ? " " Mc friend Clay , " sneered Shergill , " appears to think he 's the only lawyer in Bristol qualified to draw up a testament ! I congratulate you , sir , on the fine , imposin ' document you 've drawn up  --  at so much pains to yourself , and , no doubt , some profit at the same time ! Our own , though less imposin ' and lackin ' the ornaments on which , no doubt , you pride yourself , is no less bindin ' in the eyes of the law . Ladies and gentlemen , see for yourselves ! " It is not to be doubted that Shergill was enjoying the drama , as he unrolled and held out at arm 's length , for the inspection of all , a document stark in its brevity that smote to silence all the beholders . All to my grandson Matthew Flood . Signed : HERCULES FLOODIn the presence of witnesses : SIMON CRUIKSHANKXOn the 6th day of November 176o . Sam Rogers ( his mark ) BRISTOL 133There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the autocratic emphasis that the double underlining gave to the word " All . " That double underlining was a trick that any of his shipmasters could have identified , from their correspondences with their owner : the first line thick and passionate , forcing the points of the quill apart , the secondthin , like a shadow below the first . It was a trick which , of course , it would have been possible to forge or imitate ; less easy the writing , which , though wavering , a caricature of its original self , bore still those individual traces that evade the hand of the forger . Clay was the first of the company to recover his composure . " It would have been gentlemanly of you , sir , to have informed us of the existence of this will before the reading of the other ! " " Gentlemanliness , sir , is a quality that flourishes only when it meets its equal . You and your client , so I 'm informed , have n't been any too gentlemanly to my client in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of questions that we 've reason to believe you might be disobliging about answering ! " " Clay , we 'll contest this will ! " Jason was saying through tight lips . Clay , his own lips compressed , nodded his head . Amelia and Michal made a concerted rush to support their mother ; for once that steely warrior was shaken ! In common with the majority of her sex , Ann Flood had a horror of legal procedure ; she believed , as most women of her age and class believed , that to go to law was to invite disaster . Lawyersexisted , in her opinion , only to defraud one of one 's rights . Shivering , snivelling , she sobbed on her daughters ' shoulders , feeling that all was lost . The girls were no less terrified on beholding the collapse of the one whom they had come to regard as the more invincible of their parents . Shergill , rolling a wise eye in Ann Flood 's direction , thought , " We 've got ' cm . Jason ai n't strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly we 'll contest the will , " Jason was repeating ; he thumped the mantelpiece with his clenched fist  --  the gesture of an uncertain man . " Contest it all ye please , " nodded Shergill , " but let me warn you for your own good : you 'll not find it so easy to overthrow . " " What ? " sneered Clay . " It 's the most glaring instance of undue influencethat has ever come within my experience . " " Well , you 've got to prove that . " Shergill rubbed his nose reflectively . " It 'll take some doing , partic'larly as my client did n't know of its existenceuntil last night . " 134 THE SUN IS MY UNDOING " You expect us to believe that ? " spat Jason . It was Ralph Burmester who unexpectedly supported Shergill 's statement . His rigid sense of justice triumphing over his dislike for Matthew and his intense distaste for being involved in any affair like the present , he came forward to say : " I , for one , am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I spoke of the matter one day ; I was obliged to inform him that his name slid not appear in the earlier will  --  the only one I knew of  --  and he appeared , and was , greatly crestfallen . " " I-ie was lying ! " Ann controlled herself to whine , with the contempt of the female for masculine gullibility . " With all due respect to you , ma'am , I prefer to trust my own judgment of when a man is lying and when he is not , " said Ralph stiffly . " Ile was always a liar , even as a child ! " " I should be sorry to stake my credit , on many occasions , on your nephew 's veracity ; but in this matter I am persuaded that he spoke the truth . With your leave , ladies , I will wish you good night . " " And if you want any additional testimony to that , " said Shergill , when he had recovered from his surprise at Burrnester 's unlooked-for support , " I can give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news to him yesterday evening . By God , ' he said , it is not true ! It is not true ! ' Half a dozen times he repeated it , till I began to think I 'd never get it driven into his head . " " And why , may we ask , did you conceal this  --  if I may put it so  --  vital information from your client for so long , sir ? It would seem more natural , in view of his anxiety , to relieve his mind at the first possible oppor-tunity . " " Though I deny your right to question my methods of dealing with my clients , " said Shergill , not unpleasantly , for it is easy to be pleasant when the wind blows from the right direction , and old Roger Fortune had made him sure of his ground , " I 'll gratify your curiosity . In the first place , ' t was a matter we did n't wish to publish all over Bristol till t' other chatter had died down ; and , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sure how he would take it . " " Excuse me , sir ; you use the plural . Have you a partner ? " " The royal plural ! " smirked Shergill , who could have bitten histongue out for the slip . " ' T is a privilege our profession shares , as Ineed n't remind you , with crowned heads . As it seems to confuse you , BRISTOL 135sir , I 'll confine myself to the singular in future . My second reason was that I considered it'ud do no harm to safeguard my client 's prospects at the expense of his tranquillity . In other words , the longer he was kept hoppin ' about on the grid , the easier it'ud be to prove he had n't had a finger in the pie ! I wager there 's a score of persons that can witness to my client 's state of mind through the whole of this week  --  which , to put it plain , was n't the state of mind of a fellow who 'd just come into a fortune . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see , sir , " said Clay , flashing a glance of warning at his client , " that your client 's state of mind gives proof of his lack of complicity . On the contrary , it would seem to suggest that he was uncertain whether or not his influence over the deceased had succeeded in establishingitself before the death took place . " " Have it your own way , " said Shergill . " I 've got two good witnesses to testify to the circumstances under which this will was made : which , speaking plainly , were circumstances of a kind our friend there might prefer not to have blazoned the length and breadth o ' Bristol . If you 're prepared to go to law , we 'll meet you , with pleasure . But it 's only fair to say we 've taken our precautions  --  not to mention counsel 's opinion . This will 's in order  --  as your man of affairs is well aware , Mr. Flood ; and all the flourishes and twirls of law-writer 's hand ' ud n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , sir , you 've played a damned unprofessional dastardlytrick , " cried Clay , losing his temper . IIIWhile the lawyers bickered , while Jason endeavoured , through the frenzy of his spirit , to calm his wife 's hysterics and the funeral guests , relieved of their host 's unconvivial presence , drank on , unwitting of the thunderbolt presently to be launched upon them , Matthew stood in the graveyard of the Redcliffe , forcing his mind to grasp what had happened to him . Ever since the previous night , his brain seemed paralysed . He stood beside the closed vault , on the trampled earth that the feet of multitudes had churned into mud , and ground the palms of his hands upon the icy stone as though seeking through sensual shock to galvanize those136 THE SUN IS MY UNDOINGfaculties whose use had departed from him with Shergill 's announcement . Seeking some appropriate emotion , he found none ; it was as though he had been voided of the capacity to feel . For twenty-four hours he had spoken to no one ; his morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scenes which , although familiar , had taken on strangeness , viewed through the glass of possession in which , so far , be could neither believe nor disbelieve . It was the kind of thing that ( lid not happen , save in the old-fashioned , chivalresque novels written for and read by women : the beggar , set suddenly on horseback , to ride , so the legend went , to the devil . The only emotion of which he seemed capable was pride  --  pride that forbade him to exhibit , even to Shergill , anything of the convulsion which , for a second or two , had ravished him , to pass out , leaving him empty . I le did not know that he had gone white to the lips , or rememherShergill 's putting a glass into his hand , from which he drank , somewhattoo hastily ; for the cognac , burning his throat , had forced from him a cough , which he managed to turn into a short laugh as he remarked , " Well , it seems as though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , not knowing or caring where his feet took him . It was a good gesture , this , of indifference ; yet , if it pierced down into the soul ? Among other fantastical thoughts that , in the long nightwatches , took possession of an unfantastical brain was one about selling one 's soul to the devil . He could not recall any such transaction , yet it seemed as though he had bartered , for a fortune , all his powers of sorrowand joy , of thinking or acting in a normal fashion . He walked , a ghost , in a world of men . He had gained in one blasting second all he had most desired ; the kingdoms of the earth were his , and , with them , all the adventures and opportunities be had bitterly envied . How differently , he would have said himself , he would have received this news ! To be standing here , in silence and solitude , beside the tomb of a dead man  --  he would have laughed and cursed the idea to perdition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could imagine too well the fashion in which he would have celebrated it . But here , in Bristol , upon his own earth , it brought a different message , a message that teased him with its elusiveness . For some reason , he dared not deliver himself to it  --  to its strange echoes of premonition and warning , that sounded through the wilder motif of victory . As he stood there pressing his hands upon the stone , as thoughBRISTOL 137through it , he could make contact with that perverse old spirit that , in a moment of caprice , had chosen to transform the whole of his existence , the sound of a ship 's siren came up from the river . Words came back to his mind : " A ship fills all your waking and sleeping hours with divine uncertainty . The wind shifts , and you wonder if she 's in its track . . . news comes of a wreck , and you shiver for the cargo that stands for the better part of your fortune . . . . " Matthew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was as though the life came back to him on a shivering sigh . The Backs ! He 'd go down to the Backs  --  and find Abiathar  --  and tell him  --  and tell him of all that the future held for them both ! Then let the night take its course  --  and tomorrow , 0 blessed and radiant tomorrow !  --  he would go to the Burmesters ' and make sure of Pallas . A thousand complications might lie between this moment and the realization of his joys , but these seemed trifles light as thistledown upon the sudden buoyancy of his spirit . A few drowsy citizens were roused by the clatter of horse 's hoofs , and a few night wanderers gaped with curiosity after the great black rider who , scattering sparks from his horse 's heels , galloped over the hill . Down on the Backs there was silence ; only the splash of a waterrat , the howl of an amorous tom , the faint creaking and bumping of the small craft as it sagged upon the lapping tide . The riding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Matthew stood stockstill , an equestrian study in basalt under the uncertain moon that made ragged silver in the sky . Above him towered the great wooden palaces , fantastically and beautifully shaped , with their tangled forests of mast and rigging bared to the moonlight : each a symbol of its owner 's dreams , the visible and tangible proof of his power to transform dream to reality . On a soft night wind the smell of salt and iodine blew into Matthew 's face ... . IVNever was there such a clattering of milkmaids ' pails , such an early morning bustle , as on the day following Hercules Flood 's funeral . The milkmaids , having got the news from the households whose representativeshad had the good fortune to be present at the announcement , sent their cries of " Milk-O ! " ahead of them up the hills , carrying some note138 THE SUN IS MY UNDOINGof excitement that flung casements wider than usual and brought mistressesas well as maids to scullery doors , to learn the meaning of this strange agitation . Miss Orabella flurmcstcr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillows until Pallas dragged them away , was inevitably the first to be roused by some unusual bustle that was taking place below her window . " Pally , Pally , what 's going on ? " Sitting up to listen , she thumped her sister on the shoulder . It was still quite dark , and only a pale blur betrayedthe movement of Pallas 's head on the pillow . " Oh , dear , why did you have to wake me ? I was having such a lovely dream . " " Of Matthew , I 'll be bound , " sagaciously observed Orabella as she bounded out of bed . " Oh , goodness , it 's perishing ! Lend me your fur slippers  --  I left my own on the other side of the bed . Hang it , the glass is frosted  --  I ca n't see a thing ! " " Orry ! You 're never going to open the window ! We shall both die of cold . " " I ca n't help it  --  I 'd sooner die of cold than unrequited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milkmaid , and all the servants around her , jabberinglike fowls in a barnyard . I ca n't hear a word they 're saying  --  what can it be ? " Dragging the coverlet off the bed , Pallas ran to wrap it round the shivering little figure ; their two nightcapped heads strained out into the dank darkness , and their ears strained to the conversation. "  - -  every penny ! I tell you ' t is the truth ! I had it from Betsy Cribb , that 's got it from her mistress only this morning . " It was the first clear sentence that rose to the listening girls . " Got what from her mistress ? " cried out the indomitable Orabella , and there was a shriek from below . " Miss Orry ! For pity 's sake go back to bed . You 'll be catching your death " Never mind my death . What 's Betsy Cribb told Sukey , that you 're all so excited about ? " Sukey 's hardened lungs , dominating the others with the assertion of her right to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall . " ' T is old Mester Flood 's will , miss ! Jason ai n't got a penny  --  and young Mester Matthew 's got the lot . " BRISTOL 139 " Oh , my poor heart ! " gasped Orabella . " I vow I shall swoon . " " Not while I 'm here  --  and the window open , " said Pallas , drawing the casement to with a bang . " Pally , did n't you hear what she said ? " " Yes . . . I heard . " " ' Pon my honour , you 're the coldest , hardest-hearted thing I ever knew ! " complained Orabella as she scrambled back to bed . " Here am I , nothing to Matthew , and I 'm sure he 's nothing to me , and my heart 's going like a hammer  --  it 's enough to suffocate me . For the love of God , Pallas Burmester , are you a fish ? " " Oh , Orry , Orry , why wo n't you understand ? All of your feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as usual , Orabella stretched out her hand in the dark and touched , by accident , her sister 's mouth . What 's the matter , Pally ? Are you ill ? Your mouth 's all wet ! " " I fear I have bitten my lip , " confessed Pallas ; she was scratching for a light ; presently the candle flared . Orabella gave a shriek and buried her face in her pillow . " Oh , oh ! Your chin 's all covered with blood ! Wash it away  --  wash it away ! " Pallas obeyed , trembling so , between cold and excitement , that she could hardly handle the ewer ; she came back to bed , to be clasped shivering in her sister 's arms . " Oh , my darling ! Now everything is going to come right  --  just like a fairy tale . For even though Papa does n't like Matthew , I 'm sure he loves you much too dearly to stand in the way of your happiness with a man who can make such splendid provision for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wretch ! " " Well , but you know that was quite half of Papa 's objection . He hated to think of you living on Matthew 's wits  --  of which I do n't think he has much opinion . I am sure he will be quite reconciled when he realizes you as mistress of that lovely house and so close  --  so close to your devoted Orry ! ' That 's the best of all , " Orabella assured her , with an ecstatic hug . " You 're s-sure you do n't want me r-right out of the w-way ? " shivered Pallas , unable , even in this poignant moment , to resist the tender raillerythat came as naturally to her as the air she breathed . " Of course I do n't ! Because you would never be horrid and unprincipled , like some married women , and steal girls ' sweethearts
