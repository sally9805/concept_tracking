Through a thick mist one morning last week two fast trains ran close together on the line from Berlin to Cologne and Neunkirchen . Ahead was a Berlin-Cologne Christmas special , jampacked with third-class passengers . Behind was the regular Berlin-Neunkirchen express . As the Christmas special slowed down for Genthin station , near Magdeburg , the express passed a stop signal . Either the engineer did not see the signal , or its mechanism was faulty . Without slowing down , the express ploughed into the rear of the special , telescoping three flimsy third-class coaches . When rescuers had counted up the dead and injured there were 132 killed , including the engineer of the express , and 109 hurt . <P> Less than 24 hours later , on a single-track line north of Lake Constance , a passenger and a freight train collided headon , killing 52 , injuring 40 . Railway officials in Markdorf and Klustern , between which towns the trains were running blamed faulty signals , were arrested nevertheless . <P> These were the seventh and eighth railway wrecks in Germany since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 289 , of injured to more than 250 . Though no evidence of sabotage was found , rumors spread . A more likely cause , or contributing factor : bad condition of rolling stock and other equipment , which has not been properly repaired or replaced during Germany 's five-year rush to rearm.
