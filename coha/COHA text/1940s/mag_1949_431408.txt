" Mesabi , Iron Giant in the Earth As we flew over the iron country north and northwest of Duluth , great red holes gaped in low-swelling green hills , and even encroached on streets of towns , for mines not exhausted are constantly growing . We even saw a mine in the middle of a lake ? dramatic evidence of what man will do to get the stuff for steel ( page 309 ) . Down through the woods crawled rustyhued caterpillars , ore trains bound for the docks at Duluth . Up puffed long strings of empties .

" Iron had been struck on the Vermilion Range as early as 1865 , but required underground mining . Here all that was needed was to shovel it up . Mesabi , spelled variously , is an Indian name for a legendary giant believed to lie buried in these hills . Minnesota 's third iron range , the Cuyuna , gets its name from a man and his four-legged friend . Its discoverer in 1904 , a surveyor named Cuyler Adams , linked part of his name with that of his dog , Una . Cuyuna it became .

From Duluth and Two Harbors , Minnesota , and from Superior , Wisconsin , the ore starts across the Great Lakes toward the glowing steel mills of Pennsylvania , Ohio , Indiana , Illinois . Now two world wars and our living scale have taken great toll . Some mining engineers say that at the present rate the easy-to-scoopup open-pit ore may be gone in 20 to 35 years . Extensive indications of iron west and southwest of the present ranges were detected by airborne magnetometers of flying geologists of the United States and Minnesota Geological Surveys last year . But the experts say there is little hope that any of this iron lies near enough to the surface to be tapped by open pits .

Every time you pick up a needle , open a " tin " can , fire a gun , or drive a car , more likely than not you are using Minnesota iron . Seventy percent of the iron used in the country comes from here. * Iron ore even richer than Nature 's product can be made from taconite , a rock which is 20 to 35 percent iron and so abundant here it would meet the Nation 's needs for centuries . At the University of Minnesota 's Mines Experiment Station , long-visioned , persistent Dr. E. W. Davis last year made the first pig iron from Minnesota taconite . There he showed me how iron from the magnetic form of the rock is concentrated . Broken and pulverized , the taconite is passed under magnets which pull out the tiny dark bits of iron . When packed into pellets like black marbles , this concentrate is ready for the blast furnaces . Its iron content is about 65 percent compared to 50 to 55 percent for the nature-made openpit ore . Up in the iron country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron from rock . Machine Parts from Powdered Iron Even more interesting is the attack on the carbonate slate , 24 percent iron . By a chemical method developed by the late C. V. Firth at the University of Minnesota , this abundant rock can be made to yield powdered iron of 98 or 99 percent purity . Near Aurora , where the red-pitted Mesabi Range meets the vast northern wilderness area , a plant was erected last year with the funds and cooperation of the State to turn * See " Steel : Master of Them All , " by Albert V. Atwood , NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE , April , 1947.  | out tons of this powder . The dark-gray pulverized rock is " digested " in sulphuric acid , which transforms the iron to greenish crystals , f copperas , or ferrous sulphate . A series of processes turns this into red iron oxide , then metallic iron , which is ground into powder . At the University I watched J. D. Parrish , a young associate of Dr. Davis , pour some of the pepperlike powder into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he turned on the power , the powder was gripped with a pressure of ten tons to the square inch . Then out popped what looked like a piece of steel . Gears or other machine parts made of this compacted powder will keep popping out as long as the press is turned on and the powder lasts . When I picked up one , I found it warm . When I bent it hard , it broke . " That 's because it has n't been sintered yet , " Mr. Parrish explained as he put the parts into an electric furnace . When they emerged and cooled , Paul Bunyan himself could not have broken them . Articles made from this powdered iron have a strength between that of cast iron and steel . Hitherto , iron powder has come largely from steel-mill waste . If Minnesotans can produce it cheaply from rock , they hope many more articles can be made from powdered iron ? and right here in the State . This kind of iron would never have to be shipped east and melted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be born . When Greyhound Was a Pup Hibbing , on the Mesabi Range , cradled the great Greyhound system of motorbus transportation which now crisscrosses the Nation with big aluminum " airliners on wheels . " Last year its buses covered 500,111,935 miles , about 20,000 times the circumference of the earth . Father , or at least godfather , of the industry is unassuming , genial Andrew G. Anderson , " Bus Andy " to everybody in Hibbing . A teen-age immigrant from Sweden , he worked in the mines ; then , in April , 1914 , he and a friend bought a new Hupmobile and tried to sell cars . Townspeople clamored for demonstration rides but did n't buy . " Andrew , " suggested a fatherly Swede , " why not charge for the rides you give and run regular trips ?

After a month Charlie Wenberg , Andy 's partner , sold his half-interest in the Hup to C. E. Wickman , of Hibbing , the dealer from whom they had bought it . Mr. Wickman is now Chairman of the Board of the Greyhound Corporation . He and Andy shared the driving ? and the rising profits , which soon enabled their Mesaba Transportation Company to buy primitive buses and take on longer lines . Branching out , Mr. Wickman formed the Northland Transportation Company , which became the nucleus of the Greyhound Corporation in 1926 . Teamed with him in the swift development of the system was Orville S. Caesar , now Greyhound 's President . Greyhound got its name in Fond du Lac , Wisconsin , when a bus-line manager from Hibbing saw a reflection of a new bus in a store window . Its sleek lines reminded him of a racing greyhound . Many of the early drivers at Hibbing became Greyhound executives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hibbing .

Big homes of bygone lumber barons and of modern millionaires lend a Back Bay opulence to such impressive thoroughfares as Summit Avenue . Sprawling Minneapolis , like Washington , D.

From headquarters in Minneapolis , the Sister Kenny Institute combats the crippling effects of infantile paralysis . It struck me as typical of Minnesota that when I called at the capitol in St. Paul I was calmly handed the keys ! I wanted a close look at the gilded horses eternally galloping at the base of the dome ( pages 293 , 310 ) . " Go right on up , sir , " said the busy young man on duty in the lobby .

Alert to make the most of existing resources and to develop new enterprises , Minnesota has established State commissions which encourage private initiative . White collars and iron ore seem an odd combination , but State and local cooperation with industry recently aided in establishing shirt and underwear factories on the Mesabi Range . Housed in handsome municipal buildings , these plants at Eveleth , Virginia , Gilbert . and Chisholm are run by Cluett , Peabody &; Co. , Inc. , of Troy , New York , and employ 1,100 , mostly women . Their earnings ? some two million dollars a year ? boom local business and help avoid too great dependence upon mining , much of which is seasonal . The same State agency is pushing the iron powder project ( page 296 ) , and also is trying to work out ways of using the peat that abounds in the bogs of the north . A new plant at Floodwood now ships out carloads of peat moss for gardens , chiefly to the West Coast .

Some State officials think the day is near when peat for producing steam to make electricity will replace many tons of coal now brought hundreds of miles from the east : Russia , they point out , uses quantities of peat for industrial fuel . Others believe the big future of peat lies in its derivatives , including fuel oil , gasoline , tars , waxes , and dye chemicals .

Pioneers in Fluorine for Saving Teeth From the capitol I went to the University Minnesota , high above the Mississippi in Iinneapolis , where I saw a small boy 's nightre ? 150 dentists ' chairs , row on row in one room ( page 296 ) . The University 's School of Dentistry men Iped discover the value of sodium fluoride preventing tooth decay . Eleven years ago Dr. Wallace D.

Minnesota , in 1940-43 , showed that in Idren 's teeth decay could be reduced about s percent by painting fluorine on the teeth . This is now being widely done . In another University laboratory I saw some 30,000 of the country 's most distinguished mice . Inbred for 80 generations , equivalent to about 2,500 years for humans , all members of each strain seem as much alike as identical twins .

It also is doing important work on polio and undulant fever . Why Junior Gets Hurt Research in this great State University of 27,243 students covers a wide range of subjects . For instance , did you ever wonder why Junior is forever getting hurt and little Willie down the street always seems to keep out of harm 's way ?

Indians with guns . A couple of miles farther on we sighted-the father of this moose family , a magnificent bull at bay . An Indian two hundred yards away maneuvered for a shot . Under the law Indians can hunt anything at any time on their own reservations . Usually they need any meat they can get . Most of the 17,195 Chippewa live on reservations in the northern woods and lake country . The 993 Sioux are in the southwestern section where Pipestone National Monument preserves their ancient source of the red stone from which ceremonial pipes are still made . Such towns as Bemidji and Sleepy Eye get their names from Indian chiefs . Battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , commemorates the last battle between Chippewa and Sioux , a " naval " engagement between braves in war canoes , Reached by the scenic North Shore Drive from Duluth along the greatest of the Great Lakes , Grand Portage with its Chippewa reservation stands at the point of the Arrowhead Country , Minnesota 's great wedgeshaped wilderness area . Lonely Grand Portage was once the front door to Minnesota . Here the French fur traders entered the State , carrying their boats nine miles from Lake Superior to the Pigeon River , which leads into the labyrinth of border lakes . Their old stockade has been restored by the Minnesota Historical Society . Jumping-off places for many plane and canoe trips into the northern Minnesota wilderness are Ely and points on the Gunflint Trail , which shoots out into the lakestrewn wilds from the North Shore Drive . Key to this airy north country of trees and iron is Minnesota 's third largest city , home of the Duluth Branch of the University of Minnesota . Twenty-six miles long and an average of 2% miles wide , Duluth is squeezed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the St. Louis River . Its streets climb so steeply from the water that some give up and end in stairs . From its Skyline Parkway Drive at dusk I thrilled at the sight of starry city and harbor with its lofty , busy iron docks and varied industry . Three-foot Christmas Trees 73 Years Old Eighteen years ago Roy Halvorson ( page 306 ) gave up a $35-a-week job in a fruit and produce plant to sell Christmas trees . Friends shook their heads . " Crazy kid , quitting a good job . . . . " But the young man had an idea ? little Christmas trees , about three feet high , to be sold in large numbers at low cost . With the able help of his wife ( " She 's a good businesswoman , " he says proudly ) he tapped the enormous resources of bog and black spruce growing in mossy old lake beds . Insufficiently nourished , these trees are stunted ? only 12 or 15 feet tall ? and have no other use . They grow so thickly that their shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miniature Christmas tree . Because their natural hue is a grayish green , Roy revolutionized their sale by coloring them green , or silver , or white . Now Halvorson trees sell all over the country , and as far away as Iceland , South America , and China . Last year he sold 1,200,000 , bringing three-quarters of a million dollars into Duluth ? and getting a letter from the State Conservation Commissioner complimenting him on improving the forest . 4 322 The National Geo  | Tree-ring tabulations show that these trees , really tops , average 73 years old ! In scouting for new Christmas tree lands , Mr. Halvorson uses a plane . All four members of his family fly . Minnesota is a great flying State . Charles A. Lindbergh , first to fly the Atlantic alone , lived as a boy at Little Falls where a State memorial park commemorates his father , a crusading Congressman . On a trip to the valley of the Red River of the North , in northwest Minnesota , we talked to E. M. Saul , of Crookston , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flies to Montana for grizzly and antelope hunting . In winter he may wing to the Rio Grande to pick up ideas on alfalfa growing , and on to Mexico and Guatemala for a vacation . At Crookston is one of the State 's agricultural schools , branches of the University of Minnesota , which teach boys and girls scientific farming and homemaking . Others are at Waseca and Grand Rapids . For six months the students go to school and for six they work on the farm . This fertile valley is a bread-and-butter land . Prominent in town after town are grain elevator and creamery . Forests replaced farms as we swung northeast to Warroad on Lake of the Woods , gateway to the farthest-north point in the 48 States , Minnesota 's Northwest Angle. * Fresh-water Cod Yield Vitamins At Baudette on the Rainy River , which forms the international boundary , we stopped at a neat white pharmaceutical plant ? surprising , way up here in the woods . Its story is even more so . Stocky , blue-eyed Ted Rowell , who runs this vitamin factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as he was big enough to go fishing , he became acquainted with the repulsive-looking fish known as the burbot , which lives in Lake of the Woods and other northern lakes . Fishermen cut their lines to get rid of the light-brown , smelly , slimy , snaky-looking things , and cussed them because of their appetites for good game fish . " The burbot , " says Mr. Rowell , " is very voracious and a powerful swimmer . It can swallow headfirst a northern or a walleyed pike . I 've seen the tail of a one-pound northern sticking out of the mouth of a five-pound burbot . " As a boy , he noted that some of his Scandinavian neighbors fried and ate the livers of burbots , then drank a saucerful of the oil . These people seemed especially healthy , with good teeth and high resistance to colds . Eventually , Ted was graduated in pharmacy from the University of Minnesota and came back to open a drugstore in Baudette . By this time he knew that the burbot is a fresh-water cousin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as 10 percent of the fish 's weight . He had the liver oil tested . Back came the report : seven to eight times as rich in vitamins as cod-liver oil ! Young Rowell and his father went into the burbot-liver oil business . Today their Burbot Liver Products Company processes a million livers a year and sells vitamin pills and oil capsules on a nationwide scale . Now mayor of Baudette , Ted was on the phone when we called . " I 'm all excited today , " he said as he hung up . " For five years we 've been trying to build a hospital here , and now we 're all set ! " Trees of North Become Paper Farther on , at International Falls , a towering smokestack suddenly appeared after miles of border wilderness . Here the Minnesota and Ontario Paper Company , running 24 hours a day , makes paper and insulation board from one of the largest woodpiles in the world ( page 308 ) . Driving southward for hours through second-growth forests , we crossed the Great Laurentian Divide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters to the border lakes and the Arctic Ocean , some to the Atlantic via the Great Lakes , and part to the Gulf of Mexico . At Virginia , Ray Glumack , ex-Navy pilot . runs Northeast Airways , Inc . In winter he goes wolf hunting by plane ( page 329 ) . Since this was summer , he invited us to fly in to a lonely lake " many miles from the nearest human being " and spend the night in a tent . " It 's Big Lake on this map , " he said , " but we call it Tacklebuster Lake . " Here even I caught a northern pike , and with Ray as guide we prowled thick undergrowth until we found a long-abandoned cabin he had spotted from the air . Newspapers pasted on the walls were dated 1915 and 1916 . Women 's shoes , a rocker , and toys showed a family had lived in these deep woods where every article must have had to be lugged many miles by canoe or dog team . Why had they come and where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or a timber claim ? Or furs ? Or had this mysterious family buried itself in the big woods * See " Men , Moose . and Mink of Northwest Angle .

Above the door of the s.ne little bedroom was a homemade gold star of paper , such as those that signified the loss of a son in World War I and II . Perhaps that held at least a part of the answer . Deer are so thick hereabouts that all the cedars along shore are pruned to the height a deer can reach . This browse line is so sharp and level that it looks like a high-water mark made by the lake in flood .

Near by , the Cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slabs of Minnesota granite and gneiss for tombstones , mausoleums , monuments , banks , stores .

After winning a national reputation with his articles and books , gifted writer-architect Glanville Smith ( page 298 ) is back here happily designing monuments , spark plugging the Cold Spring Men 's Chorus , and serving as president of the Stearns County Historical Society . His writing , he says , was just a phase . This is the life he likes best . At Sauk Centre , the Main Street town where Sinclair Lewis lived and wrote , I arrived just in time for a charivari , which Minnesotans pronounce " shivaree . " A luckless pair of newlyweds was being ridden down the world 's most famous Main Street on a manure spreader ! Such antics are undertaken when the bride and groom fail to give a dance for their playful friends . Close to Alexandria , center of one of the State 's most beautiful lake resort areas , is Kensington where a farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Runestone , once exhibited at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington , D. C.* Most of the towns in the fertile southwest part of the State are primarily farming centers ; but industries are establishing footholds in many . Redwood Falls , for instance , makes women 's panties , and farm boys learn precision instrument making in the war-born Tubular Micrometer Company plant at St. James . Worthington , far in the southwest corner , calls itself " the Turkey Capital . " Last year it * See " The Smithsonian Institution , " by Thomas R. Henry , NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE , September , 1948 , page 343. hatched 3,114,000 turkey poults , considerably more than the number of people in the State . Austin , Home of Spam At Austin we visited the George A. Hormel &; Co. packing plant , where Spam originated . A former mayor and several aldermen work on the " dis-assembly line " where gleaming white hog carcasses are reduced to ham and bacon . Hormel has become nationally known not only for its beef , pork , veal , lamb , and meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guaranteed wages for a full year ahead . Production exceeding fixed quotas yields extra incentive pay , and a joint earnings plan gives employees a share in the company 's profits . Built and maintained by grants of money from the Hormel family is the near-by Hormel Institute , a unit of the University of Minnesota doing research in biology and chemistry . South of Spring Valley we drove through thousands of acres of peas , and saw fleets of trucks rushing the green spheres to a big canning plant at Rochester . In the fields , " viners " that thresh out the peas were working day and night . Eastward to the Mississippi , prairie gives way to rolling hills . Near the Iowa border are limestone sinkholes into which , local tradition says , whole plow teams have disappeared . We could readily believe it when we visited Niagara Cave , near Harmony , and saw its underground galleries created by running water .

A novel new business there is A. R. Kleinschmidt 's Lakefish Canning Company , which makes a palatable product from carp , long netted from the lakes as a nuisance . Feathers and Furs from Far Lands Many other odd industries have sprung up hereabouts . Who would think that the feathers of a jungle fowl from India or the hair of an African orange baboon would wind up in the mouth of an American trout because a boy in Waseca , Minnesota , loved to fish and study insects ? Thanks to quiet , scholarly George Herter , who majored in entomology at the University of Minnesota , his home town is the center of a world-wide business in exotic feathers and furs used by anglers for tying flies ( p. 311 ) .  | Herter 's shelves are crammed with about everything but " eye of newt , and toe of frog " ? moose mane , gazelle hair , fox tails , golden and Lady Amherst 's pheasant necks from China and Tibet , English starlings , ostrich plumes , peacock tails , porcupine quills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each serves its particular purpose . A single hairy fiber from a condor feather forms the body of a mosquito so realistic you want to slap it . White tips of English starling feathers are lifelike eyes for artificial minnows . Porcupine quills make buoyant bodies for floating flies . Polar-bear hairs , waterproof , have a glasslike glint that appeals to fish . A strict conservationist , Herter buys no skins of birds or animals protected by law . Waseca is also the home of the E. F. Johnson Company , which makes radio components and transmitters widely used by police and taxicab fleets . At near-by Owatonna the Josten Manufacturing Company turns out class rings and other jewelry ? a type of industry Minnesota tries to encourage , since the product is high in value for its size and can be shipped to eastern markets without heavy transportation cost . At the opposite end of the weight scale are railroad equipment , made at Fairmont , and the Tilt-a-Whirl , manufactured at Faribault . This carnival " thrill ride " device was conceived when a local man took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bump at a curve on a rough dirt road , and noted how the lurch delighted his boys . Faribault , city of schools and flowers , is the home of the State School for the Deaf and the Minnesota Braille and Sight Saving School ( page 324 ) , where children study geography by touch on relief maps , improve their sight if any remains , and learn how much the other senses , especially hearing , can tell the blind . " People talk of the blind having a sixth sense , " said a teacher , Torger Lien , sightless from birth . " Actually it 's echo reflection , like radar . When I walk past a hedge , for example , my ears tell me it 's a hedge , not a wall . A hedge has as much right to sound like a hedge as it has to look like one .

Alike to 4 @# a king with failing sight and to an Iowa farm boy kicked by a horse , this is a medical court of last resort ( pages 325 and 335 ) . Mayo Clinic might be said to have sprung from a cyclone . When a " twister " killed 22 persons and injured many more in Rochester in 1883 , English-born country doctor William Worrall Mayo took charge of an emergency hospital and was aided by Sisters of the Order of St. Francis . Six years later , at the request of the Sisters , Dr. Mayo and his surgeon sons , William James and Charles Horace , undertook direction of a 40-bed hospital erected by the Order on Rochester 's outskirts . This formed the nucleus of the present St. Marys , largest of the city 's hospitals . Today this world-famed clinic makes Rochester one of the Nation 's distinctive cities . Its business is health ; its whole life revolves around the Romanesque tower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downtown streets connect the clinic with hotels and hospitals . From atop the tower waft the notes of the Rochester Carillon of 23 bells ; the largest weighs nearly eight tons . Head of one of the several sections of general surgery is Dr. Charles W. Mayo , fondly called " Chuck , " grandson of the original Dr. Mayo . The clinic building also houses the Mayo Foundation , affiliated with the University of Minnesota ; outstanding young doctors from the Nation 's medical schools are chosen for postgraduate study here . The Mayo Clinic leans over backward to avoid criticism on the score of self-aggrandizement . A few years ago some Rochester youths organized what they called the Surgeons City Motorcycle Club and rode around the countryside in shirts bearing that name . At once the Mayo doctors were disturbed lest this look like advertising . An emissary to the motorcyclists induced them to abandon the name and accept a present from the Clinic ? new jerseys lettered Rochester Motorcycle Club . Some of Minnesota 's finest scenery lies along the Mississippi east of Rochester . Mark Twain called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . nothing to hang a fret or a worry upon . " This sense of peace was heightened by the sight of 18 pet otters playing like kids on the otter farm of Emil E. Liers at Homer .
