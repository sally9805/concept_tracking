The Thundering Herd of Wall Street FOR the last six years New York 's deep thiancial arroyo , omniscient Wall Street , has had certain remarkable information about missing persons that police never seem to know and newspaper headlines never announce . Witness the case of the eccentric Collyer brothers , two elderly recluses . On March 21 , 1946 , Homer Collyer was found dead in his home , a strange junk-crammed brownstone in upper Manhattan . Langley Collyer , his brother and long-lime partner in a furtive , hermit existence , was missing . For seventeen days police burrowed into the Collyer clutter and chased rumors across nine states before Langley 's body was found at home , hurled under piles of newspapers in a rat run . The search attracted nationwide attention  --  except in Wall Street , where , long before April eighth . brokers were answering phones to hear other brokers confiding , " Didja hear ? Langley Collyer has been found . " " You do n't say ' . Where ? " " In hiding . He 's a partner in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The implication that any missing person can be shuffled into oblivion as a partner in their firm strikes the real partners of Merrill Lynch , Pierce , Fenner &; Beane as a highly acceptable form of humor . Since the partners number eighty-aixfifty-seven general and twenty-nine limited  --  they take as inevitable , and incidentally nice advertising , a good many pokes at their multiplicity . The firm has frequently been referred to as the Bureau of By ARTHUR Jr BAUM Missing Persons or The Thundering Herd . More commonly it is called WE the People , or plain WE . or The People . The long name , as good a target as the number of partners . has earned it such descriptions as Alphabet Soup . But there is a great body of earnest citizens who conscientiously grope for the name and ca n't quite make it . They wind up simply with Merrill Lynch , Pierce &; Something . WE is a brokerage and investment firm . It is outsize in all its dimensions , something more than twice as big as the next largest brokerage house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the securities business , has adapted a number of chain-store principles to its business , and its principal partner , Charles Edward Merrill , is a sort of financial granddaddy to the variety , grocery and shoe chain-store industries . WE is not only a commission , or wire , house , handling stock and commodity orders for clients on stock and commodity exchanges , but an underwriter of new securities for companies which issue them , a retail distributor of new securities which it owns and itself sells , a trader in unlisted securities which are shopped around by telephone , and occasionally a broker in actual commodities like meat . tlour , eggs and sugar . Wall , La Salle and Montgomery streets have probably never before seen as long a name , as great a number of partners or as extensive a private-wire system . WE operates 45,000 miles of private wires connecting ninety-five offices in ninety-four cities . Roughly one of every ten buy or sell orders filled on the New York Stock Exchange floor is a WE order . More than 4000 such orders will feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , and on WE 's biggest day in its six-year history , 15,000 orders were handled . The firm holds eighty-six memberships in thirty-nine stock and commodity exchanges . It has 100,000 active customers on its books , twice that many inactive names , and 2800 employees . The size of WE is , in many ways , irrelevant . A big brokerage house is not necessarily better , or worse , than a small brokerage house , and all brokerage firms , today are different from those of the roaring ' 20 's . WE is certainly different . It combines the Wall Street changes of a decade and a half with some revolutionary wrinkles of its own . WE is committed to the idea that the financial district will never again be what it was in 1929 ? and not a had thing , either . WE accepts regulation of its industry by Government , and some of its partnere were active participants ) in the revolution that changed the New York Stock Exchange from an inviolate society to a public institution . WE is resigned to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweetheart of the business , and plans its future on serving a multitude of modest investors . This future , WE believes , rests soundly on the fact that hell the potential investment market has never been touched . WE is thoroughly aware that the public has long been distrustful of the members of its profession and battled by its mysteries . It does not , as it might very well , take a resentful and defensive attitude toward this public view . On the contrary , it is firmly committed to mixing around with h the neighbors and dealing with its sleeves conspicuously rolled up to the elbow . And it has good support for this policy . Only those completely ignorant of the broker end his functions want to lynch him . The collective partners of WE do not conform to the traditional idea of partners of Wall Street financial houses-1.o each his own yacht and a million dollars . No general partner owns anything larger than a forty-foot fishing boat , and probably only four , at most six , could rake up a clean million of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York or its environs , and twenty-two rose from office boys , runners , clerks or telegraph operators . The general partners are not equal partners . Charles Merrill has about 25 per cent interest in the firm . The smallest interest is one quarter of one per cent . Salaries , as such , have no particular relationship to interest in the firm , but vary with the job covered . A good steam-shovel operator strip-mining coal earns in wages about as much as the lowest-salaried partners . Seventeen of WE 's partners never attended college , fifteen never finished college , and twenty-two achieved degrees from assorted institutions , of which Amherst is , influentially , the most important . Charles Merrill and the No. 2 man , Managing Partner Winthrop Hiram Smith . are Amherst graduates . The N s Behind t he Name The gawky name , Merrill Lynch , Pierce , Fenner &; Beane , derives from three predecessor firms , and , for all its unwieldiness , is understandable . Merrill Lynch &; Company was formerly a very prominent underwriting firm . The name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown away . E. A. Pierce &; Company was once the most extensive wire house in the country , and Edward Allen Pierce 's name was one to keep . Fenner &; Beane was one of the very large stock and commodity wire houses , a particularly popular firm in the South . It , too , was not disposable . Thus , when the present partnership combining these three firms was effected , August 18 , 1941 , the name simply dragged out to full length without any logical opportunity for omission . But back among the distant roots of the family tree , many once prominent and useful names had been jettisoned . Bernard M. Baruch and Arthur Housman , " The Morgan Broker , " were once partners in the firm that became E. A. Pierce &; Co . The mine of Gwathmey , highly valuable in the South a Id *gemming hack to 1820 , gradually got lost . So did Colvin ; Dean , Onativia ; Otis ; Logan &; Bryan ; : Slaughter &; Russell ; Jno . F. Clark ; Fuller , Rodney ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more of these names . Old customers may mark them down as associated with fortunes they made or tragic losses they suffered . But to brokers and investment houses they are reminders that for the last decade and a half the securities business has been too poor to support all those it once was accustomed to support . To the outsider it occurs that the brokerage business must certainly have been inept to have lost so many participants and so much prestige in a mere fifteen years or so . To Charles E. Merrill , the casualty list was simply more evidence that the brokerage business was the most poorly managed business he could think of . He once told his partners , " If R. H. M ncy ( l he department attire ) hail dhe same npproach'In the import ant expenses , the business-getting ex-penises , that all members of the New York Stock Exchange have , I assure you R. H. Macy and Company would he out of business by next April Wet , and it would n't he April Fools ' Day either . " Merrill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on April 1940 , two days after I he birth of the idea and structure which is now Merrill Lynch , Pierce , Fenner &; Beane . At t hat lime , however , it was not the full-blown WE . Its name was Merrill Lynch , E. A. Pierce &; Cassalt . Merrill himself was not Musically a broker . He did not particularly care for the trading hack and forth of existing securities and was only now returning to the husiness after len years out of it . He wils an investment banker . His career was founded and nourished on the providing of new capital for companies . preferably small ones , which had able management and wanted to expand . He was closely identified with the chain-store field , beginning with McCrory and reaching a peak in Safeway . He had put Safeway Stores together , had done all its financing . invested in it himself , and zealously studied its management . When , after nineteen years , he suddenly decided that neither he nor anyone else realty knew anything about chain-store operation , he induced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find out what made it tick . The one great conclusion this st udy reached was that the customer was absolute king . Any rights the grocer thought he had , such as traditional markups , were pure self-delusion . The customer knew what he wanted and there was only one thing to do  --  gel it to him at the price he was willing to pay for it . Now Merrill had reached the same conclusion in the brokerage business . He believed the brokerage customer was getting only what habit told the brokers they ought to give him . He was ready to kick over this idea and , 81 art ing at what was hitherto I he wrong end , build a brokerage business on what the customer wanted . There was management . Merrill told his partners the whole industry was dreamily living on the interest it collected on unpaid balances of margin customers , and actually losing money on every individual transaction . The average income per transaction in a typical office was $10.17 , not enough to cover the cost of handling it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one of our clients , the XXX Evaporated Milk Company . can content the cow , milk it , pasteurize the milk , put it in the can , put a label on it , put it in a box , advertise it , ship it all over the world , and sell the can of milk for five cents , then you will realize how perfectly frantic these figures make me feel . " Upset by the fact that brokers were maintaining large public rooms when 85 per cent of the business was handled by telephone , Merrill said , " It is perfect damned nonsense for us to maintain a gilded palace to take care of fifteen per cent of the people who infest it ; we are all through with running a club and charging no initiation or monthly dues . " Merrill had no intention of cutting expenses at the cost of the legit Miele customer . On the contrary , the firm planned to snuggle up to the customer , especially the modest customer . It made the most , seductive advances . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downright shameless , highly undignified , and not in keeping with the Street 's traditions . But there was a reason . In April . 1940 , Merrill had the results of two surveys , one conducted for the New York Stock Exchange and one made for Merrill Lynch , E. A. Pierce &; Caasalt by the Braun Organization . Both pried into the attitude of the customer toward the markets , the exchanges and the brokers . Both usually placed the Stock Exchange . the financial industry as a whole  --  and in one case Merrill Lynch , E. A. Pierce &; Cassatt  --  somewhat above snake , but distinctly below skunk . " The results of these two surveys , " Merrill said . " are shocking . To us who have conducted our business along honorable and ethical lines , it is almost incomprehensible that so large a percentage of the public can have so poor an opinion of our character and honesty . No self-respecting broker can complacently sit by and ignore this criticism , some of which is unquestionably just itied . " What the surveys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industry 's patent misdeeds , the Pecora revelations of 1933-34 , the Richard Whitney scandal , the propaganda of early New Dealers interested in establishing cont rol of the markets , plus an abysmal public ignorance of finance and its functions . People had , in 1939 , some horrid views of the markets , and of brokers . A third of the public knew nothing about the New York Stock Exchange . and cared nothing . Misunderstanding of the function of short selling was almost universal . Most customers picked brokers by friendship or personal relationship . More than half did not want telephoned advice on the market , did not want to he given price quotations without request , and did not want to keep securities in safekeeping with the broker . Almost all customers were dead set against receiving hot tips on the market . Later surveys added further blows . People possessing surplus money , whether they were familiar with securities or not , preferred to put it into real estate above everything else . Those unfamiliar with securities not only preferred real estate over stocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never bought securities before , on , average , did not want to do so even if they had extra money . And if they did they would ask advice of their hankers first , a friend or relelive second , and only ae a poor third choice would they consult the broker . These were dismal facts , but in DM Charlie Merrill was safely insulated from them . He had been an investment banker and chain-store man for twenty-seven years , had a large fortune , homes in Palm Reach and Southampton , a good appetite for food and liquor , en excellent golf game and the comfortable knowledge that he had been importantly instrumental in making big companies out of many little ones . His partner , Edmund Lynch. , had died in 1938 . His firm had sold out its brokerage business in 1930 to E. A. Pierce &; Company . He was comfortable and free . He had never aspired to be a broker . When the great bull market was nearing its peak in 1929 , he thought the country was going absolutely nuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , he thought maybe he was the one who was crazy . To find out , he visited a psychiatrist and asked him . The psychiatrist pulled some slips out of a drawer showing that he had sold all his securities . " If you are crazy , " he said , " then so am I. " There was every reason why Merrill should stay out of the brokerage business . But he had some ties . When , in 1980 , Merrill Lynch had turned its brokerage business over to E. A. Pierce &; Company , it had also turned over $5,000,000 in capita for the merged firm , and several of its partners . One of these partners was Charlie Merrill 's former office boy and fellow Amherstian , Winthrop Hiram Smith . Smith , an earnest , nearly humorless student of the securities business in which he had spent all his business life , wakened in the middle of a night in 1939 to see an icy , threatening possibility . No one will ever know whether he was right or not , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partnership was due to expire by limitation on January 1 , 1940 . Normally it would be extended for another ten years , if the partners were agreeable . But suppose they were n't ? Smith had the sudden terrible premonition that many of the partners were not agreeable . And he could n't blame them . The brokerage business was dull , had been consistently dull for six years . brokers were still in disrepute . The struggle against the times was not inviting , and unless something happened to stimulate and cheer them , surely some of the partners would simply vote to dissolve the firm . The citizen in the street , remote from the misty world of stocks and bonds and paper commodities , would hardly see anything significant in a brokerage house dissolving if it felt like it . But Smith saw it as a possibility of the most critical importance to the whole country . E. A. Pierce &; Company was a widespread national wire house , the largest in the business . It was perfectly solvent . But word that it was dissolving would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The impact on the Street could not fail to be violent . It might be so violent that the solvent firm , caught in a shock wave of its own making , might conceivably fail to finish its own liquidation solvently . That , indeed , would be a disaster felt far beyond the financial district . Smith 's whole life and savings were tied up in a firm which , literally , had no plan for its own continuance . And he could think of only one man who could prevent what he was afraid of , and not only prevent it but reinvigorate the entire partnership . Smith hastened to Charlie Merrill . He outlined his foam . He further outlined the possibility of a realistic streamlining of 1110 firm , He said be could cut $500,000 MT annual expenses . He pointed to the opportunity for Merrill to try out ideas Smith knew he had . Finally he Haiti . " Charlie , there it is . In your tax brackets you are a fool to come in , You ca n't make anything but peanuts ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will he a fool , " Merrill was a fool . He grumbled at Smith and swore and asked for figures and more figures , and grumbled and swore some more . As he approached the decision , he was n't fit to live with , but int he end he reached down and picked up the gauntlet . On April 1 , 1940 , after the Pierce partners had waited three months for his decision , the new firm of Merrill Lynch , E. A. Pierce &; Cassett was born . Merrill came back as the boss , the only role that ever fitted him at all . He had plans , a complete set of them . He had a checkmate ready for every reasonable criticism of the industry that the surveys had revealed . Did the client lack confidence in the broker because he was mysterious ? Very well , the firm would operate in a goldfish bowl . It would even publish regular profit statements and balance sheets , although the Stock Exchange only required brokers to furnish such information privately on request of the customer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a security it recommended , sold or analyzed ? Then the firm would publicly and voluntarily state its own position in any such security or company . " I am convinced , " Merrill said , " there is nothing in the world that clears the atmosphere faster than a complete disclosure of your position If we should prepare a pamphlet on the Kresge Company , we will say we have attempted to get figures together in the most scientific and impartial manner that we know how , but we are only human beings . We will state that Mr. Merrill has been identified with this company since 1921 . He has seen it grow from earning four hundred thousand dollars a year to over eleven million . He is not impartial about the Kresge Company . He is a partisan of the Kresge Company . He believes in it completely , although he may be wrong . And finally , we 'll tell our clients that the total holdings of the general partners of this firm , including Mr. Merrill , are so many thoogsnd shares . " Note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on chain stores . It stated , under its customary ranking of interest ( large interest , over $100,000 ; substantial , $50,000 to $100 , - 000 ; small , under $50,000 ) that the firm had ; Large Interest : Kresge , Lerner Stores , McCrory , Safeway Stores , Winn &; Lovett Grocery Company . Small Interest : Colonial Stores . Franklin Stores , W. T. Grant , Melville Shoe , Montgomery Ward , J. C. Penney , Sears , Roebuck , and Western Auto Supply . What about those things the customer had indicated he did not want ? Why did he prefer the advice of a doubtless uninformed friend or relative or his banker , before he considered the broker , the assumed market expert ? Did he suspect that the service man who was handling him had a direct personal interest in his activity , possibly a percentage on the transaction or at least a salary frequently and rapidly adjusted to the business he wrenched out of the customer ? Why was the customer against receiving gratuitous telephone calls ? Why did he vigorously avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was suspicious , that was enough . Then give him no advice . If he asked for it , give him a noncommittal analysis . Spend a half million dollars a year providing research information . Educate him into making his own decisions . Divorce the service man from dependence on the volume of business he coaxed out of his customers . Put him on a Hat salary for long periods . Raise him by merit and competence regardless of his volume . Make it unnecessary for him to persuade widows to take speculative fliers . Prohibit the discretionary account absolutely  --  that type of trading account where the customer permitted the broker to buy and sell for him without specific orders . That does n't sound very revolutionary , but it was a mighty wrench in some of the country 's brokerage board rooms . Traditionally the service man lived or died by the trading volume of , to strain a comparison , his troupe of performing dogs , his jealously guarded , carefully tended clients . They were his . They followed him to another firm , he hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their ears and they traded accordingly . When the market was booming they made him a lot of money . Ask such a man to drop the leash on the troupe he had built up and trained to trade ? The firm said , " Yes . Drop it . " " But these clients are my living . I can take them across the street and make good money on them . What do I get from the firm that 's worth the risk ? " Merrill had to give a good answer to this question . He was asking numbers of people , including many Of his now jutrtnere , to abandon the tight little bundler ' Of client business on which their careers had been built and to work for a firm . Not for theinselveal For a firm , It was simple , Merrill said . The service man need not wheedle , bully or manufacture his own business . The firm would get the business " for him . He would he free to service it . He would thenceforth be judged by his ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was a heresy that required some selling . Merrill Was applying t he chain-store technique to the securities businees . He was saying that the firm , as a firm , would get the customers into the store , would arrange and display the merchandise so that the customers would want to pick it up , and that the service people , including the partners , would now spend their time exclusively keeping the shelves stocked , the store swept and the cash register ringing . It was easy to believe that this would not work . Plenty of people today  --  and a few of them are not outside of WE  --  ca n't believe that the relationship between broker and client is anything but a doctor-patient relationship , which no chain-store system , no matter how big or able , is going to replace . In 1940 , brokerage firms were still aloof , dignified , somewhat arrogant . They adveriised by permitting their names , and Little more , to appear in so-called tombstone ads in the financial columns of the papers . They never wooed customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be called , who controlled big-shot trading accounts , not infrequently because the customers ' man was a relative of the account . The business was generated by these men and by the partners themselves , who were commonly elevated customers men . The firm was a sort of respectable and even impressive boardinghouse for the intensely individualistic activities of its members and inmates . Groceryman Merrill promised that this system would be rudely and profitably upended . The firm would advertise aggressively  --  in 1947 WE spent $1,500,000 on advertising , research and promotion . It would be provocative and educational advertising , directed to the public at large , to people with investable money everywhere . It would get into magazines , even on the radio . The firm would issue and offer a flood of printed material  --  analyses of individual stocks , analyses of groups of stocks , discussions of broad economic trends , explanations of ? commodities and trading in commodities . It would , as fixed policy , charge the lowest permitted commissions ; it would take only the equivalent of a commission out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underwritings and participation in the sale of new securities to reasonable amounts , so that no excess would be left to force on its customers ; it would operate one wire exclusively for news and information , and provide elaborate research facilities for answering inquiries . In short , the firm would operate as n chain store , a low-profit , high-volume store full of a wide variety of merchandise . By making itself conspicuous , by accumulating and following up leads from inquiries , by offering low prices and a flood of service , it would get people into the store . Once they were inside , the bruins would be on a shelf , sticking right in the customer 's eye . The sign would say : " These are beans . They are red kidney beans . We think red kidney beans are nutritious , palatable and satisfying . We have learned the following facts about red kidney beans from what we believe to he a reliable source . . . . The price is seventeen cents a pound . We do n't know whether it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents ; in our view , a reasonable price . However , it is your appetite , and if you do n't like red kidney beans . note the green limas on the next shelf . " In outline , this practice looks positively angelic . In operation , it was slow to get under way , humanly sprinkled with mistakes , and frayed by friction from old beliefs . The time was inauspicious . The sluggish bear market in stocks had two years yet to run . Within its first year the new firm was badly hit by the forced resignation of one partner who had broken a rule on one of the stock exchanges . While the firm was still recovering from this black eye , Winthrop Smith got on the track of what looked like embezzlement by another partner . Late one night he called the suspect into his office . " We are missing a hundred and sixty-six shares of American Telephone in our stock account , " he said . " I 'm afraid I 'll have to ask you to explain . " The suspected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startled Smith could move , the suspect turned the butt toward him and said , " Will you take this ? I 'm afraid I 'll use it . on myself . " This was embezzlement  --  and the firm was committed to a goldfish-bowl operation . Smith sighed and turned to the telephone . He called the police . He called the newspapers . Within a matter of months , a third partner broke an SEC rule and had to resign . The incident ruined an underwriting deal on the preparation of which the firm had spent thousands of dollars and numberless working hours . Its customers were expecting the securities to be offered  --  and they did n't come . It was painfully and harmfully embarrassing . Meanwhile the stock market was dull . The commodity markets were dull . American corporations had no wish to issue and sell securities on a lethargic market and there was no pressure for expansion . At the end of its first calendar year the new firm had lost money . Some of its chain-store ideas were frankly disliked by competitors . Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfair and , if widely followed , would give business to the largest houses regardless of their merit . The firm broke a long-standing agreement on the Pacific Coast and refused to charge a higher commission there than east of the Rockies , earning itself Western competitive ill will . Fellow brokers along the Street frequently thought the firm 's wide-open advertising was undignified and reckless . But there were some who admired and even some who copied . Then , in 1941 , the groceryman 's type of business earned a tremendously important convert from among its competitors . Two of the senior partners of the large wire use of Fenner 8i Beane visited Win pith . They came swiftly to the point . Their operational genius , Philip Russell , was a very ill man and they were afraid that he would never be able to resume is excellent management of the firm. - Looking around among their other partners , they found none with Rus- sell 's abilities , and they needed man- agement . They had been watching the Merrill Lynch , E. A. Pierce &; Cassatt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To put it bluntly , how about a merger ? On August 18 , 1941 , the two firms were merged . Merrill Lynch , Pierce , Fenner &; Beane was born . On August twenty-fourth , Philip Russell died . The year 1942 was a skimpy one for the first full year of WE operations . The stock market had been declining irregularly since 1937 , and in mid-1942 hit a new low in volume . New capital flotations for the year were down almost to 1932 levels . WE squeaked through with a modest profit  --  a partner with 1 per cent interest would have received that year only $1460 as his share . That was the bottom . In 1942 WE handled 8.1 per cent of the volume of round lots-100 shares or multiples ? on the New York Stock Exchange , and 10.2 per cent of the odd lots . By 1947 the firm was handling 9.1 per cent of the round lots and 12.5 per cent of the odd lots . Commissions earned on the purchase and sale of listed securities , principally on the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income-63 per cent of its total in 1946 . Underwritings and transactions in unlisted securities accounted for 15 per cent , commodity commissions 13 per cent and miscellaneous income and interest 9 per cent . Merrill 's financial chain store that year spent $1,552,820 to get customers into the store  --  in research , advertising , publishing , radio . It paid . In 1946 a 1 per cent partnership interest was worth $62,160 before taxes .
