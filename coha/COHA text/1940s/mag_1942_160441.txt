For three days last week WinstonChurchill and his critics in Parliament had at each other . Then Parliament gave him the vote of confidence he asked for-464-to-1-but it was not confidence without qualifications . <P> The single opposition vote was cast by lank-haired , intense James Maxton , one of Parliament 's three ultra-left Independent Laborites who represent Glasgow 's shipyard workers. * More important , 67 of those present did not vote at all . And as far as a large part of Parliament was concerned , the vote was not wholehearted ; it just seemed necessary . Afterward Winston Churchill 's many critics went right on criticizing . <P> The vote seemed necessary because , whatever may be said against Churchill or the men around him , few Britons can imagine anyone else leading Britain through the war . Moreover , among those few are hard-shell Tories who abhor Britain 's alliance with Russia and would like to restore post-war Britain as a Tory paradise . Most of Parliament was determined to give them no encouragement . <P> But , vote or no vote , Parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The Opposition . Of his critics the Prime Minister said : " No one need be mealymouthed . . . . There are . . . people who talk and bear themselves as if they had prepared for this war with great armaments . . . . But we have only had two and a half years of fighting and we have only just managed to keep our heads above water . When I was called upon , nearly two years ago , to be Prime Minister there were not many applicants for the job . Since then perhaps the market has improved . " <P> Russia . Despite Britain 's own needs , said Winston Churchill , Stalin had been sent " exactly what he asked for . " <P> North Africa . " I can not tell what is waiting for us . ... We have a very daring and skillful opponent . . . . Whether you call it a victory or not , it must be dubbed ... a highly profitable transaction . . . . " <P> Second Front . " Imagine what would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second front ! Every ton of our shipping , every flotilla , every airplane , the whole strength of our Army would have been committed and fighting for life , and these troubles of the Far East and of the Middle East might have sunk into insignificance compared with the question of another and far worse Dunkirk . " <P> The Far East . The Prime Minister declared that the sunken warships Prince of Wales and Repulse had been sent to Singapore in the hope of deterring Japan from war . No aircraft carriers had been sent with them , for a very good reason : all but one British carrier had been undergoing repairs . <P> He looked for a " great deal more " Far Eastern trouble , explained : " While facing Germany and Italy here and in the Nile Valley we have never had any power to provide effectively for the defense of the Far East . . . . Sixty thousand men were indeed concentrated at Singapore , but the priority . . . was accorded to the Nile Valley . For this decision , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy toward Russia , I take the fullest possible responsibility . . . . "
