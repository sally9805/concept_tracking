The brain center of the war against Japan moved closer to the objective last week . Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz issued his 244th communique from " Advanced Headquarters , Pacific Ocean Areas , " and correspondents were permitted to say that it was " several thousand miles west of Pearl Harbor . " Nimitz had previously mentioned Saipan and Guam as possible sites for his vast command . <P> The 21st Bomber Command , whose B-29 Superfortresses fly from Saipan fields , had already moved its headquarters to Guam . The 21st had far outgrown its elder brother , the 20th , based in India and China , and burly , black-jowled Curtis E. LeMay ( at 38 the Army 's youngest major general ) had flown from Chengtu to Guam to take over . Haywood S. ( " Possum " ) Hansell , a specialist in planning , was recalled to Washington . <P> The carriers of Admiral William F. Halsey 's Third Fleet , after weeks of rampaging up &; down the coast of Asia and its guardian islands , had no new action to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sulphur Island ( Iwo Jima ) , mid way between Guam and Tokyo , where the enemy persisted in repairing bomb-pocked airstrips in order to fly off planes against the B-29 base at Saipan . For an hour and a half , a 16-inch-gun battleship , heavy cruisers and destroyers poured shells into the 2-by-5-mile island 's airfields , gun emplacements and docks . Three enemy ships were destroyed . Earlier the same day , B-29s and B-24s had dumped almost 200 tons of bombs on the nuisance raiders ' lair . The little island was getting a lot of attention .
