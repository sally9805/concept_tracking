txt Phantom newspapers have been " rolling " out of this city 's three daily newspaper plants for the last 20 days  --  nobody has ever seen them . Staffs of the Cleveland Plain Dealer ( daily circulation : 234,509 ) the Cleveland Press ( circulation : 265.594 ) and the Cleveland News ( circulation : 129,8821 have been covering their " beats " and writing headlines but the - newspapers " they 've been producing have n't gotten any farther than the . pressrooms . The final step , putting the ink to paper , has been halted by a /s-age dispute between about 150 pressmen on the three newspapers and the Cleveland Newspaper Publishers Association . The last of the three papt  --  rs to publish in this community of - 11 , million population was the Plain Dealer on the morning of January 5 . What Happen .. a rec .. % - Since then this metropolitan community has been living the answer to the socialogical question of what happens when the country 's sixth largest city ' . is deprived of its daily newspapers . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cleveland Press , a Scripps-Howard chain member , said they missed their daily newspapers , department store sales have continued to gain over comparable periods of a year ago , theaters have noted little change in their attendance figures , and special community events . usually dependent on newspaper publicity , have reached close to anticipated attendance volume . The press men walked out on strike when the publishers refused to eaecede to a demand for an increase of $14.64 a week , an increase of 38% over their 1941 rate , The publishers . the week before the walkout , had offered the press men an increase of $10.86 a week , a figure which the publishers held to be about 30% above the 1941 rate and which they said was in line with increases granted other craft unions in their plants . All efforts at arbitration or mediation have failed . Staffs of all three of the papers . including all departments except the press men .. have been reporting to work daily during the dispute . going " through the motions " of getting out the newspapers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an edition on the street on fairly short notice . Even the Plates Are Cast Compositors are setting type and preparing page forms from which page proofs are being drawn for the papers ' files . Stereotypers on the News are also casting the half cylinder page plates which fit onto the presses . Those are piled up as usual in the press room each day and then carried back to the stereotypers ' quarters at the customary time to be remelted . Editors , staff writers and columnists are also utilizing their spare time to catch up on research work , to bring their library " morgues " up to date , and to weed out " their files . Clevelanders are finding it extremely difficult to feast their eyes on newspapers from ether cities . The customary number of out-oftown papers are coming in  --  from New York . Pittsburgh . Detroit , Chicago and many other cities , but no more than the customary number . " We 're not going any extra copies of any out-of-town newspapers . " said Cleveland 's largest newsy per distributing agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortage ? " An exception is the Christian Science Monitor . Normally only two Monitors are sold on Cleveland news-stands , one at a bus station , one in the lobby of a downtown bus station . Today 13.000 Monitors reach Cleveland every day for distribution by newsstands . Christian Scientists of Cleveland , who arranged for the receipt of the papers . go daily to the Union Terminal , pick up the papers and take them in their own cars to news-stands . The church members pay three cents for the papers ? sell them to the dealers for three cents . The price to the reader is five cents . Sales on Cleveland 's six foreign language dailies have jumped sharply , but they have served little to relieve news-starved diets . The local office of The Wall Street Journal has been swamped with new subscriptions since the strike started . Also all office copies normally used by the office staff have been sold to people who come into the office . Fortunately , from the typical newsman 's point of view , there have been no manor local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reorganization event of political - significance , an important " obit " concerning the death of a prominent lawyer , and the local angles of the national strikes . But both editors and reporters are keeping their fingers crossed against the possibility of another conflagration such as the Ehst Ohio Gas Co. explosion and fire several years ago in which scores of persons lost their lives . Generally speaking , digests of each day 's important news are being prepared by the papers and will be published when the str.ke ends . One paper plans to picklip the current day 's comic strips when the publishing is iesumed and to present alongside them synopses of what Orphan Annie , Dick Tracy or Li'l Abner has been doing in the interim . Radio Tries to Fill the Gap Cleveland 's four radio stations have stepped into the breach with an expansion of their local news coverage , but the Press poll of readers claimed that 73% were dissatisfied with local news coverage by radio and 61% were dissatisfied with world and national coverage . For some of the radio stations the emergency has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news dissemination . Station W.G A.11 for instance . puts out a daily mimeographed bulletin that contains the highlights of national , international and local news . The mimeographed sheets are distributed to downtown hotels and restaurants . The station has delegated news gathering and writing tasks to salesmen and announcers who have had newspaper training . Station W.H K. reinstituted a service it maintained during the war by installing loudspeakers in the public square and In the vestibule of the Terminal Tower . Station W.T.A.M. has put on 30 extra news presentations since the newspaper pressmen went on strike almost three weeks ago . It estimates that its coverage of local and regional events has been increased by 65% . Station Takes on . " Leg Men " - Before the newspaper strike went into effect , station W.J.W. presented 8 to 10 news broadcasts a day . It presents 14 a day now , and about 50% of the news is local . Before January 5 , W.J.W. did not maintain a staff of reporters for the collection of news . Today it has three regular " leg men " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also provides listeners , every night at 7 , with the names of persons who have died during the day in Greater Cleveland and the time and place of the funerals . On the same program births are announced and the activity of local stocks is reviewed . In its ohiturary program , the station works closely with the Florists Association of Greater Cleveland , which acts as a clearing house for information on deaths . Each day , the Funeral Directors of Cuyahoga County furnish the florist 's association with a list of new deaths . Fier:sin Are Given Details The association in turn relays the information to the radio station and to the 250 retail florists in Greater Cleveland , who then provide callers with details . Despite these emergency measure ... , business of the florists has slumped somewhat but has not approached the " drastic " curtailment that would have otherwise resulted . A few days ago the association received a phone call from a man who asked for information on the death of a woman he knew only by her first name of " Belle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California . The association scanned its list and found that the woman had died in Indiana and that her body had been brought to Cleveland for burial . Cleveland shoppers , despite the lack of newspaper advertising , have " smelled out " arrival of scarce goods and have continued to form lines for women 's hose and other short supply items . Department store males since January 5 have continued to climb , according to Fourth District Federal Reserve Bank figures , eclipsing comparable weeks of a year ago . For example , for the week ending January 12  --  the first week of the pressmea 's strike ? department store sales jumped 8% over the same week a year ago , and sales for the week ending January 19 increased 11% . City Sake . Behind District Executives of the city 's four largest de . ; partment stores do not call their increased sales an argument against advertising . however . They are quick to point out their gains might have been even greater if their ' regular advertising schedules had been followed . There 's no way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been no strike , but the Federal Reserve Bank figures for the entire Fourth District might be interpreted as a fair barometer . The district gain in department store sales for the week-ending January 12 , for example , was 10% and the district increase for the week ending January 19 was placed at approximately 19% , or S% more than Cleveland alone . One department store executive explained that the usual relationship between advertising and sales could be4accounted for by the artificial demand and supply situation of practically all goods . " Customers have been waiting so long for so much stuff , " he commented , " that they just rush to buy it whenever they see it or hear about it without waiting for an ' invitation , ' , in the papers . " One women 's apparel store doing business on a second floor shop reported , however , that its business had dropped a small degree beesense of the lack of newspaper advertising . Relieves Circus Suffered i Movie houses report there has been little variation of attendance figures since the strike began , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circus which appeared here last week had good attendance but one of its agents reported his belief that with usual newspaper coverage it would have netted an additional $30,000 . On the other hand , attendance at the Ice Follies now showing here is at capacity , it is reported For its publicity the Follies used radio spot announcements ; direct mail in the form of postcards announcing the opening , space on the backs of cabs , and lobby . space in a theatre . As the result of advertisements in northern Ohio newspapers , a show agent said , " mall order sales have been terrific . " ?
