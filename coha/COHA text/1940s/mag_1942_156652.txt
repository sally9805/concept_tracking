In two darkened rooms in the basement of Yale 's Institute of Human Relations , a Yale psychologist is working on a prime problem in wartime human relations : how to see at night . Last week tall , affable Professor Walter Richard Miles reported that he was beginning to get somewhere . He had developed a pair of goggles to help Navy lookouts and plane spotters . Fresh from a three-month study of blacked-out London 's darkness , he also had some helpful hints for civilians on how to get along when the lights go out . <P> A longtime student of night vision , Professor Miles explained that the retina of the eye has two kinds of vision cells cones and rods . The cones ( about 7,000,000 ) , concentrated in the retina 's center , are used mainly for day vision . The rods ' ( 130,000,000 ) , distributed around the edges , are used for seeing in the dark . <P> " Within five or six minutes after we enter a well-darkened room , " says Professor Miles , " the cones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times as sensitive . This is as far as they can go . But . . . the rods get more and more sensitive for 20 or 25 minutes after the cones have stopped adjusting , finally increase their sensitivity 1,000 times . This is night vision . " <P> Dr. Miles 's new owl-sight goggles are designed to eliminate this period of waiting for the eyes to get used to darkness . Having found that the rods work better in red light , he made his goggles of red filters . A lookout who wears them for 30 minutes before going on duty can see almost instantly when he steps into darkness . <P> Because the rods are on the periphery of the retina , the best way to see an object at night is not to look directly at it but at a point near it . The catch in this off-center technique is that it handicaps a person in judging his distance from an object ; pedestrians sometimes walk smack into a truck at the curb because they suppose that the dark mass they see is a building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to judge distance at night : the nearer an object is , the fuzzier its outlines are ; move the head from side to side-the object will seem to move rapidly if it is close by , slowly if far <P> Another tip : a pedestrian in a blackout should keep out of the way of a vehicle with lights-he can see much better than the driver .
