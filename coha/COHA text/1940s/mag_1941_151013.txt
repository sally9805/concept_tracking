At the White House the President conferred daily with Secretary of State Cordell Hull . Subject : whether to kill completely or merely dismember the Neutrality Act . <P> Up on Capitol Hill the opposition conferred . Unnoted by the press , General Robert Elkington Wood , kingpin of America First , slipped into town . The bulky General moved boldly into the Capitol itself , into the private office of Montana 's Isolationist Senator Burton K. Wheeler , in the Senate 's Interstate Commerce Committee room . <P> Wood , accompanied by Sam Pettengill , former Indiana Congressman and a rabid Roosevelt-hater , took over Wheeler 's office as headquarters for a lobby against the impending Neutrality amendments . ( The last private citizen who invaded a Congressional office to bore at legislation from within was John L. Lewis : he moved into Speaker Bankhead 's office during a fight on amendments on the Walsh-Healey Act . When Congressmen found out about it , they raised the roof . If anyone has tried it since , he has kept it dark . ) First plan had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But most isolationist Congressmen who were invited preferred a free tour of Fort Belvoir , Va. , where the Army planned to let the Congressmen have a field day of fingering guns , swinging on ropes , inspecting the camp , and eating in the regular mess ( with tablecloths , however ) . So the lunch was called off . <P> Wood and Pettengill began placing calls , rounding up the anti-Administration members . Some sincere isolationists refused to attend . Among the Senators who came were balding , sobersided Robert Taft of Ohio , red-faced Bennett Champ Clark of Missouri . ( Wheeler was out of town , speechmaking . ) <P> Wood was told that both Chambers would easily pass an amendment permitting the arming of merchant ships ; that an amendment to permit U.S. ships to enter so-called combat zones would be hard-fought ; that isolationist mail had slumped since the President 's " shoot-on-sight " speech ; that Congressional isolationists were climbing on the Administration bandwagon . The strategists decided to revert to the old tactic of stirring up the letter writers of the U.S. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Congress and the President . <P> As Wood withdrew to digest his reports , the President called a White House conference of members from both parties . To them he would put his ideas , weigh their opinions and objections . The decision called for all the statesmanship he possessed . He could risk everything now on one smashing fight to repeal the entire act-which his advisers held would be an enormous boost to the morale of all the world . Or he could move as he has been moving , step by step , whittling the act 's barriers away one by one . The first choice would involve great risks . Even defeat was possible . The second choice would mean a shorter step , with victory almost certain . <P> Events still might make the choice unnecessary . From Rio de Janeiro came a radio flash : the I. C. White , 7,052-ton American-owned Panama-registered tanker , had been torpedoed and sunk on Sept. 27 in the South Atlantic , with a loss of four of her 38 men . This was the eighth U.S.-owned ship sunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
