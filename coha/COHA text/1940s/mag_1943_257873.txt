Manhattanites opened their windows and their hearts again last week : spring had come and with it the circus . Since last year the great Ringling Brothers and Barnum &; Bailey troupe had acquired something besides $325,000 worth of new costumes . It had acquired a new top boss-Robert Ringling , who after a rumored family wrangle succeeded his cousin John Ringling North-and a new attitude . Gone were the Stravinsky ballet music , the Balanchine choreography , the blue tanbark and all the rest of the modernistic decor which had raised complaints and possibly cut the profits . Once again everything was traditional , absurd and gaudy as a gypsy 's jewels . <P> The 14,000 opening-nighters who got into Madison Square Garden free by buying $3,000,000 worth of War Bonds saw , for a starter , a fine turn-of-the-century circus parade . While the band blared A Bicycle Built for Two and After the Ball , boys &; girls rode their tandems and dandies strutted . Then came wild beasts in gilded cages , plumed horses , heavy-footed elephants , white-faced clowns , a singing steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way of a magnificently jumbled United Nations pageant , the show offered many thrills but no surprises . Its starred newcomer is fragile Lalage who , hanging by an arm to a rope , flapjacks herself an incredible number of times in the upper air . With a two-cycle , five-man act , the perennial Wallendas outdo their past achievements on the high wire . As of yore , The Flying Councellos leap , Elly Ardelty stands on her head on the flying trapeze , Massi-milliano Truzzi juggles flaming torches . Tigers walk treadmills , horses curvet superbly and Harry Rittely sits atop seven tables and topples over backwards . <P> Again on display in the basement are going-on-13-year-old Gargantua and his eleven-year-old spouse M'Toto . They are still childless-because they are too young to mate , says the publicity . But the National Geographic Magazine long ago described M'Toto as a male .
