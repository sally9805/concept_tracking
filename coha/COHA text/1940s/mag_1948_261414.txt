He was neither a polished writer nor a knowing crystal-gazer . But brawny Irving Kupcinet ( pronounced CUP-senate ) had proved , to the satisfaction of Marshall Field 's Chicago Sun-Times , that one good local columnist will outsell all the syndicated canned goods on the market . " Kup 's Column , " a casually tossed salad of chitchat and nightclub gossip with a Leonard Lyons-like flavor , is easily the most widely read feature in Chicago . <P> This week , when its author returned from vacation , he had a new contract with the Sun-Times at $22,500 a year , a 50% raise . That made Irv Kupcinet Chicago 's second best-paid columnist , next to Chicago Tribune 's Sport Editor Arch Ward ( $50,000 a year ) . Kup is taking on other chores too ; he has two radio jobs and was dickering last week for two more . <P> Bad Shoulder . Thirteen years ago , Kup was a $32.50-a-week sportwriter on the Times . Son of a West Side bakery driver , he worked his way through Northwestern and the University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . His career as a pro footballer ( with the Philadelphia Eagles ) lasted only five games ; a shoulder injury turned him into a sport reporter . In 1943 the Times let him try a column . Cracked Kup : " I spent all my time in nightclubs anyway . " <P> Like all gossip columnists , Irv Kupcinet finds nightclubs exciting , and gets some of the excitement into his column . Every night , sportily dressed in a shirt with long Sinatra-style points ( and with KUP loudly emblazoned on his handkerchief , tie clasp , cuff links and gold ring ) he patrols such spots as Chez Paree and the Shangri-La , slapping backs , sipping coffee , soaking up column items . His red-haired wife tags along , often wearing a blouse stenciled with his columns . He haunts the Pump Room of the swank Ambassador East Hotel , a telephone plugged in at his table . Even at home , where he keeps five phones jingling , his privacy has a public atmosphere : he is redecorating the dining room as a miniature Pump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightclub . <P> Cloudy Crystal . At 36 , Kup is still the stage-struck footballer who loves to meet celebrities . Ruggedly built ( 6 ft. 1in. , 215 lbs. ) for a rugged 16-hour-a-day job , he is hearty and likable , though newsmen wince when he calls them " buddy-boy . " ( He calls Gable " Clarkie . " ) Once he proudly noted in his column that his seven-year-old daughter has a standard answer to kids who ask what her father does : " He writes the best damn column in town , and if I do n't say so , they twist my arm . " <P> The extraverted , sometimes ungrammatical column that Kup 's pub-crawling distils is blended with many predictions , on the usual columnist 's theory that some are bound to come true . ( About 50% do . ) But it is written without malice or fakery . <P> Already running in the Los Angeles Daily News ( with Chicago paragraphs cut out ) , it starts next month in Rio de Janeiro 's English-language Brazil Herald . " They do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baffled Irv Kupcinet . " Must like the stuff . I ca n't think of another goddam reason for running me in Brazil . "
