Shaggy-haired Jimmy Conzelman may not be the best coach in pro football , but he is a favorite of sports writers anyway . No one else has so ingratiating a way of passing off his victories , or so good-natured a way of explaining his defeats . He almost gives the impression that he thinks football is a game , not a business . <P> After winning seven out of eight games , Jimmy 's talented Chicago Cardinals got their brains beaten out two Sundays in a row . What had happened ? Struggling for the answer , Jimmy got to his feet before lunching sports writers in New York a fortnight ago . His explanation : he was being hoodooed by a radio announcer . <P> Said he : " The Cardinals refer to him , in hushed tones , as Fearless Bert Wilson . He has fixed upon the Cardinals a cold , disapproving eye , and frankly , we are not up to meeting it . We have lowered our own eyes . He has been predicting for weeks that the Cardinals would fold up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson was at the mike as usual when Conzelman 's Cardinals stalked the crosstown Chicago Bears in a battle royal at Wrigley Field . And as usual , Wilson had made his partisanship clear : " I do n't care who wins , as long as it 's the Bears . " The temperature was a chilly 35 , but Conzelman 's boys were hot . By beating the Bears , they won the National League western division championship , and silenced-at least for the moment-radio 's voice of doom . Score : Cardinals 30 , Bears 21 . <P> Other winners : <P> For the second straight year , the Cleveland Browns beat the New York Yankees for the All-America Conference pro football championship . One of the big men for Cleveland : rubber-armed Quarterback Otto Graham , who completed 14 of 24 passes . Sometimes his receivers had to work hard to make the catch . The score : Cleveland 14 , New York 3 . <P> Notre Dame 's Johnny Lujack , 22 , quarterback extraordinary , won the Heisman Memorial Trophy , by a landslide , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coach-of-the-year , in a New York World-Telegram poll of 272 college coaches , was Michigan 's smart Fritz Crisler . <P> Jake Kramer , who has already turned pro , was rated the nation 's No. 1 amateur tennis player ; after him , and thereby the heir apparent , came robot Frank Parker .
