New evidence that Africa and South America may be parts of a single continent that have drifted apart came from British geologists . They reported finding gorceixite pebbles in Africa 's Sierre Leone ( south of Dakar ) and the Gold Coast . <P> Gorceixite is a rare mineral that is quite worthless except as an indication that diamonds may be found near by . But the significance of the discovery had nothing to do with diamonds . It had to do with the fact that hitherto gorceixite has been found only in Brazil , whose bulge , if slid eastward around the globe , would fit neatly into the Gulf of Guinea , against the shores of Sierre Leone and the Gold Coast . <P> Some competent geologists admit the plausibility of the continental drift theory , which holds that all the continents were once a single big land mass , " Angaea , " surrounded by water . Angaea was presumably broken up and dispersed by 1 ) the centrifugal force of the planet 's spinning , 2 ) the gravitational pull of sun and moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's axis to its present screwy angle . <P> Favorite quarrel among geologists is whether or not the continents are still drifting . One school holds that Greenland and Scotland are 60 feet farther apart every year , that the distance between Paris and Washington increases a foot a year . Others insist that it will take many more years of astronomical measurement and scientific study of latitude and longitude to prove any drift at all .
