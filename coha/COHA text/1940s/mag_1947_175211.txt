Few of the admirers of Sir Luke Fildes ' work would recognize his name . Art critics pass him by sniffily . But his best-known painting has been reproduced as widely-in schoolbooks , ads , doctors ' offices , and on postcards-as almost any in history . Last week Fildes ' The Doctor turned up on a 3 stamp . <P> Fildes ( rhymes with shields ) would not have been too surprised . In the daguerreotypes of his heyday , Sir Luke looked like any well-fed Victorian gent , complete with goatee , chesterfield , and top hat . But he was more : a member of England 's Royal Academy and a painter of royalty , including Edward VII , Queen Alexandra and George V. <P> Even before he began work on The Doctor in 1891 Sir Luke knew it would be a great success : " more terrible , perhaps , but yet more beautiful , " than anything else he had done . A careful workman , he first built in his London studio , like a movie set , the cottage interior he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and painting the dawn stealing in the prop window , Fildes inserted the characters he had in mind : worried parents hovering in the shadows , their sick little girl feverishly sleeping in the light of an oil lamp , and the bearded doctor leaning over her , kindly and calm . <P> When he had it the way he wanted , Fildes began all over again , larger . The final version , which hangs in London 's Tate Gallery , is still a great crowd-puller , but a less sentimental age no longer weeps openly at the sight of it , as visitors once did . The smaller first version is the proudest possession of the Guthrie Clinic in Sayre , Pa.
