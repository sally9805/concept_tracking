txt WASHINGTON , March ** Standard Oil Company of New Jersey refused to reveal to the United States Navy and the British Government its processes for making synthetic rubber but turned over the process to Germany and Italy through the I. G. Farbenindustrie of Germany , before the United States ' entry in the war . Thurman Arnold , assistant attorney general , told the Truman committee today . The Standard 's process was " cheaper and better , " Mr. Arnold said , than the processes by which synthetic rubber is now made in Germany : - , ; Mr Arnold asserted that evidence obtained from the company 's correspondence files , showed that Standard had agreed to do its best to maintain an arrangement throughout the war with the L G. F. " whether or not the United States came in . " Even after Pearl Harbor , he asserted , it had refused to release synthetic rubber products in the United States . After hearing the testimony , Senator Truman told reporters that , in his opinion , the company 's actions constituted " treason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to permit Mr. Arnold to complete his testimony tomorrow and to let Standard Oil executives present their side of the case Tuesday . Mr. Arnold contended that there was no essential difference between what the Standard Oil Company did and what other companies , operating in cartels , have done to restrict production of magnesium , aluminum , tungsten-carbide , drugs , dyestuffs " and a variety of other critical materials for war . " Thus , although the Assistant Attorney General told the committee that the consent decree filed yesterday in Federal Court at Newark , N. J. , had released for free war use patents held by Standard for manufacture of synthetic rubber , airplane gasoline and other essential products , the committtee apparently was not disposed to let the matter drop . Mr. Arnold introduced a letter dated Oct. 12 , 1939 , from Frank A. // SAYS STANDARD OIL GAYE NAZIS PATENTS Howard , president of the Standard Development Company , to W. S. Parish , president of the Standard Oil Company , dealing with a meeting held in The Hague with German chemical trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the I. G. Farben trust representatives ) delivered to me assignments of some 2,000 foreign patents and we did our best to work out complete plans for a modus vivendi which would operate through the term of the war , whether or not the United States came in . " " It is impossible , " Mr. Arnold commented , " to doubt that the Hague memorandum is anything but a devise for the continuation of the conspiracy through the war . " " Here , " commented Senator Truman , " is an agreement made with an enemy with whom we are actively at war and here is our greatest corporation holding patents absolutely essential to the war program and it is necessary to use all our legal and legislative power to get the patents into a pool to prosecute the war effort . It is an outrage . " I am reliably informed that there was no effort on the part I of Standard to turn over these patents to Jesse Jones and others interested in the development of synthetic rubber until it was discovered the committee was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described the development by Standard subsidiaries of a new synthetic rubber , butyl , which cost " seven to fifteen cents a pound compared with twenty cents for natural rubber , " and which he said was " cheaper and better " than any Germany had . This , he said , was turned over to the German trust , but information about it was refused to the American Navy . Mr. Arnold quoted from a letter , which he said was written by a Standard official under date of Nov. 21 , 1939 , as follows : " Because of the possible application of the butyl rubber to some of the Navy 's requirements , Mr. Werkenthin had been instructed also to look into the manufacturing process . I took Mr. Werkenthin to the plant when it appeared that I could not very well steer his interest away from the process . " However , I am quite certain he left with no picture of the operations . " This refusal to facilitate the development of synthetic rubber by giving samples persisted even after Pearl Harbor , stated Mr. Arnold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the consent decree was issued , that free dissemination of essential information had been made possible . " At the time Standard , " he continued , " was refusing to make available samples of its butyl rubber to English and American concerns , it had already sent full information to I. G. F. in answer to an inquiry of an Italian company . " The American corporation , he said , referred the Pirelli Company , an Italian concern , to the German trust " in accordance with instructions of Mr. Howard . " He quoted from a letter sent by Standard to Pirelli which asserted " the rights for butyl rubber for Italy are held by the L G. Farben A. G. of Germany . " Farben , however , did not release full information on its synthetic rubber , buna , to Standard because , said Mr. Arnold , quoting from a company document , " the Hitler government does not look with favor upon turning the invention over to foreign countries . " The Justice Department official added that , according to Mr. Howard 's testimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " because of military expediency . " In 1938 , according to Mr. Arnold , a Standard executive committee memorandum stated : " Mr. Howard deplored the fact that the German Government 's restrictions on I.G. 's freedom of action have prevented our making material progress in the American field . " The official testified that April 20 , 1938 , Mr. Howard wrote that " until we have this permission ( from Germany ) , however , there is absolutely nothing we can do ; we must be especially careful not to make any move whatsoever without the consent of our friends . " Mr. Arnold went on : " The requirements of the German Army and German industry are now supplied by the I. G. F. buna rubber and Germany 's production of rubber equals her former imports . This has freed Germany from the necessity of running the United Nations blockade on rubber . " At the direction of German interests , Standard Oil refused to license independent producers in the United States for the production of synthetic rubber . It turned over all its discoveries to Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return . We believe the cartel arrangements with Germany * * * are the principal cause of our present shortage of synthetic rubber . " But the Assistant Attorney General said that Standard did not enter these arrangements with any desire to aid Germany but rather was trying to extend a monopoly . " Standard Oil of New Jersey desired a world monopoly on oil and synthetic gasoline ; I. G. Farbenindustrie was interested in chemicals , " he said . " Each wanted to be free from the competition of the other and also from independent competition . They , therefore , agreed that in the chemical field , which included synthetic rubber , I. G. Farben would control . " To implement that agreement Standard Oil was to turn over any chemical processes to I. G. Farben ? either information or any patents ? any chemical processes which it discovered not directly connected with its oil production . " Each company gave the other a world monopoly in so far as they were able to convey it , with the exception that Germany reserved its own market in synthetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubber in the United States .
