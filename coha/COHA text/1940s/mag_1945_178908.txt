Anchors Aweigh ( M.G.M. ) , a shore-leave saga with music , dancing , and Technicolor 's full palette , is easily the pleasantest couple of hours that can be bought currently in a movie theater . Its standard-bearers : Gene Kelly , a sailor fairly enough described as the Sea Wolf ; his sidekick Frank Sinatra , a shy type but eager to learn ; Kathryn Grayson , a movie extra who wants to become a famous singer ; and Jos Iturbi , who is surprised but very nice about it when Miss Grayson , being kidded by the sailors , turns up for an audition . <P> It is a stock enough plot for a musical comedy , but there is nothing purely stock about the way it is told . The characters have a good deal of character , humor and likeableness ( Sinatra mourns to Kelly : " Sometimes when I watch you , I got a feeling that there 's something wrong with me " ) . Kelly dances beautifully and Sinatra sings the roof off . They seem genuinely concerned over their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they find their own affections setting them at odds - a difficulty nicely solved , for Sailor Sinatra , by warmhearted Waitress Pamela Britton . And their four days ' strenuous romancing is as rich as fruitcake with diversions and digressions . Among the best : <P> The gay , easy byplay between Kelly 's rock-solid acting , which carries the show and is as sure as anything in pictures , and Sinatra 's gently amateurish pseudo-goofiness , with its engaging echoes of Stan Laurel . <P> The lyrical songs What Makes the Sunset and I Fall in Love Too Easily , elegantly prepared for the I-walk-alone voice and manner-and Sinatra 's unaffected , hypnotic singing of them . <P> Kelly 's dancing-the first in movies to stand comparison with Astaire 's . <P> Seor Iturbi 's boogie-tinged recording , with full orchestra , of an extravagant tonal double-banana-split based on Donkey Serenade . <P> There are enough such specialties to sink a battleship . But they keep Anchors Aweigh paced , buoyant and prettily afloat . <P> Teen-Age Girls and Where 's the Meat ( MARCH OF TiME-20th Century-Fox ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become national preoccupations . The teenage girl , multiplied by some six million , has become a consumer with a mind very much her own : an object of special interest to magazines , department stores , dress designers , model agencies , musicians . <P> Sociologists and psychologists seek her " expert guidance " and learn , from the filly 's mouth , that she likes privacy , pinups , shelves for doodads , lolling interminably at telephones and in bathtubs . She also likes " slumber parties " ( which are talkative rather than slumberous ) with wolf-cubs whistling below the windows . She does not care to look old or sophisticated , uses simple cosmetics ( but pays elaborate attention to shades of lipstick ) , and saves her dignity for formal dances . She reads much in magazines , little in newspapers or books . She is hep to new records and takes an occasional turn at baby-sitting for pocket money .
