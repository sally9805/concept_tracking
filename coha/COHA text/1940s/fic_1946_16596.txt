MAIN STREET OF A SMALL NEW ENGLAND TOWN - DUSK FADE IN LONG SHOT . The small cluster of cheaply-constructed stores indicates that it is more of a small village shopping center than a town . While it is only late afternoon , the grey clouds overhead , and the fine spit of rain in the air , give evidence that it will soon be dark . There are a few pedestrians on the street , dressed in the attire of the early 1900 's . Over scene comes the SOUND of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a moment , a horse-drawn carriage appears , and the hollow SOUND of the horses ' hoofs becomes louder . As the CAMERA MOVES IN , we see that the small store fronts bear legends such as , HENRY 'S GENERAL STORE , VERMONT PHARMACY , LADIES ' APPAREL , BAKERY , etc . Over the entire street hangs a heavy sense of expectancy , as though the village awaits some disaster . As the CAMERA CONTINUES MOVING , we begin to hear the SOUND of the carriage wheels and the horses ' hoofs replaced by that of the faint , tinkling piano music usually identified with old- time movies ' accompaniment . As the music becomes louder , the CAMERA TURNS on a corner building facing the group of stores ; it is a two-story hotel , of late Victorian architecture , ornate and elaborate . There is a short flight of wooden steps , and bannisters covered with curlicues , on either side . Over the entrance is a sign , which reads , " VILLAGE HOTEL " The CAMERA MOVES UP the stairs and through the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SHOT - It is the usual hotel lobby of the period , with a stiff , formal atmosphere , a few over-stuffed chairs and an uncomfortable looking divan . Several dusty , potted palms line the walls . In spite of the SOUND of the tinkling piano music coming over scene , there is a peculiar hush over the place . THEN THE CAMERA PANS to a clerk who stands back of the desk writing ; he is a lanky , not-too-bright looking young man , and when he finishes what he is doing , he hurries from behind the desk to another part of the lobby .  --  2  --  THE CAMERA PANS with him , and then we see that one end of the lobby has been partitioned off with black velvet drapes . Several people are looking with great concentration through a gap in the drapes . The clerk joins them , gently shoving his way between two of the people ; they turn to give him a dirty look , but he is oblivious to it as he peers eagerly over their heads - a smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crudely-lettered sign which is pinned to the drapes . It reads , MOTION PICTURES ( THE WONDER OF THE AGE ) 2:30 &amp; 7:30 " The Kiss " THE CAMERA MOVES over the heads of the people standing before the drapes to 3 INT . OF MAKESHIFT MOVIE AUDITORIUM SCREEN - DUSK MED . SHOT . A flickering , badly-lighted picture is being shown on the screen . We now hear the soft , clicking SOUND of the motion picture projector . The picture is nearing its finale , for the characters on the screen are preparing for their last embrace . THE CAMERA HOLDS on the screen for a moment . 4 MED . SHOT the audience ( front view ) . It is not a large audience , and they sit tensely on the edge of their straight-backed chairs . The small group is composed of men , women , and children of all ages . The ladies sit with their elaborate hats in their laps , and enthralled expressions on their faces . 5 MED . CLOSE SHOT Helen Capel . She is a young girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is poorly , but neatly dressed , and a shabby coat is carefully folded over her lap . Small and pale , and in spite of her unostentatious appearance , there is a certain luminous glow about her that gives the illusion of beauty . Her eyes shine with an attractive expression of curiosity - not only for that which she sees on the screen - but for a curiosity in the expectancy of the future . She is obviously without escort , for she is tightly wedged between two hefty women . But she is unaware of her discomfort , as she cocks her head slightly in keen anticipation of that which she views on the screen .  --  3  --  6 FULL SHOT screen in b.g. , back of audience in f.g . There is a feeling of breathless awe in the air as the spectators view the newest and most wonderful of inventions - the movies . The picture is in its last moments , for the heroine , with half-parted lips , and slightly dilated nostrils , is about to clutch her man . The tinkling piano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MOVE SLOWLY UPWARDS , leaving the screen . As it reaches the ceiling - 7 INT . HOTEL ROOM ABOVE - DUSK MED . SHOT . It is a typical , badly-furnished hotel room , lighted by a single , dim bulb hanging from the ceiling . There is a lumpy bed in one corner , and a battered dresser against the wall . An attractive young lady stands before the grimy mirror in the process of getting dressed . Her hair is in tight curls , and she wears the voluminous petticoats of the period ; she has yet to put her dress on . She is examining herself closely in the mirror ; dissatisfied with what she sees , she pinches her cheeks for color , and then she looks into the mirror again . The muffled SOUND of the tinkling piano music can still be heard from below . The CAMERA PANS to the window . It is half open , and a wind gently stirs the stringy curtains . The CAMERA REMAINS on the window for a brief moment , so that there is a feeling that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wind continues to stir the curtains . 8 MED . SHOT the mirror . The girl leans closer to the mirror ; she bites her lips , then she wets them ; she looks closely for effect . Suddenly she stops , as though she 's experienced a chill , and she feels her bare shoulders as though she were cold . She turns and looks towards the window . She seems rather puzzled , as though she 's surprised to find the window open . She moves ; as she does so we see that she limps slightly . 9 MED . SHOT the window . She comes into the shot , and she limps to the window ; she is about to close it , but she hesitates a moment , and she looks out into the street .  --  4  --  10 EXT .

She pauses over several dresses which are hanging there , and she finally selects one . 13 MED . SHOT girl at the closet door . She is just turning from the closet , the dress over her arm . She absentmindedly pushes the closet door but it only closes half-way . She goes out of shot to the dresser . The CAMERA HOLDS for a moment , then it moves slowly into the closet . 14 CLOSE SHOT several dresses on hangers . At first there seems to be nothing unusual about the dresses hanging there , but suddenly there is a slow movement as two of the dresses begin to separate . Something moves from the roar of the closet . The CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSER : 15 CLOSE SHOT eyes . A pair of eyes peer forth from between the dresses . Only the eyes are seen , the rest of the face is in shadows , or hidden by the folds of the dresses . The eyes are obviously watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the eyes , going closer and closer until the entire screen is taken up with them . Then the CAMERA SEEMS to actually ENTER the eyes , themselves , causing an intermingling of the pupils and general diffusion. 16 MED . SHOT girl at dresser ( from viewpoint of camera ) . This shot is through the hanging dresses , from the interior of the closet , through the half-open closet door . The scene which we view now is distorted . The girl we 'd seen earlier seems to be twisted out of natural physical shape . Although we are able to see her actions at the dresser through the diffusion , we are most conscious of the fact that she limps as she takes a few steps back to see herself better in the mirror .  --  5  --  But the limp which we 'd seen earlier , now seems exaggerated , grotesque ; where it had seemed incidental before , it is now high-lighted by the distortion of the camera - until it becomes the predominant physical characteristic of the girl .

Then she expertly puts her hands through it ; it is tight-waisted and she bunche it up carefully open . The CAMERA CONTINUES MOVING , SLOWLY , CAUTIOUSLY , towards the girl to : 17 MED . CLOSE SHOT the girl ( with her back to the camera ) . This is still viewed through the distortion . Evidently the dress is momentarily stuck , for she stands there with her arms stretched over her head , as she attempts to pull it down . The CAMERA HOLDS ON the girl a moment , then it begins to PAN UPWARDS until we see only the girl 's up-stretched hands . In the b.g. are the top of the mirror and the ceiling . The CAMERA HOLDS there briefly ; then the screen becomes even more blurred than before . Suddenly we hear a muffled gasp come over scene . The girl 's fingers grow very tense , and they seem to clutch at thin air . 18 MED .

The screen boars the legend , " THE END " The tinkling MUSIC stops abruptly , and we hear a brief scuffling , then something which SOUNDS like a water pitcher breaking . 19 MED . SHOT the audience . There is a stunned , puzzled expression on their faces as they look at one another . After a brief moment , we hear a heavy muffled thump from overhead . Slowly , one by one , the audience looks to the ceiling , with terrified , frightened eyes . 20 CLOSE SHOT Helen . She , too , looks towards the ceiling . While hers is a frightened expression also , it is mingle with a lack of excited curiosity .  --  6  --  21 EXT . OF MOVIE AUDITORIUM FRONT OF DRAPES MED .

Number nine . 24 EXT . OF DOOR MED . SHOT - the clerk begins to pound on the door , and several of the hotel guests begin to gather behind him . When there is no response , he turns the door knob , and he pushes the door open . 25 INT . OF ROOM MED . SHOT - ( FROM CLERK 'S ANGLE - LOOKING DOWN ) . The girl is on the floor before the dresser .

The windows are large and protected with green , heavy shutters , typical of the residential quarter of a prosperous town . The house sits , blocked with solid assurance , against the background of the shrouded hills . It seems to offer a resistant front to the solitude and the storm . Its state of excellent repair is evidence that no money has been spared to keep it weather-proof . There is no blistered paint , no defective guttering , no broken slates . The whole is somehow suggestive of a house which , at a pinch , can be rendered blind and secure as an armoured car . 72 EXT . YARD MED . LONG SHOT - Garden and trees . Helen is running down walk .
