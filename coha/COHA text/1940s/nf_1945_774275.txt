When herded on grassland , horses are kept on the high mountains from late June through July and August to avoid heat and flies . During September , October , and November they are kept on the lower slopes and during the remainder of the year in the valley areas . Where grass is not available , straw or stalks ( rice , oat , millet , etc. ) are the only roughages fed in most cases . Straw is usually chopped into short lengths before feeding . This is as short as 3/4 to 1 inch in Shansi and Hopeh , while in other areas the length is approximately 2 inches . Iris and other non-poisonous plants of low palatability are cut in the fall for roughage in Ningsia . Bran ( wheat ) , peas , kaoliang , and black soybeans are the grains commonly fed to horses , the grain most commonly used depending upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given by dampening the straw and mixing the bran with it . Soybeans are often soaked before feeding . Peas and corn , in areas where they are fed , are usually given whole . Straw is usually dampened when fed alone . In some areas horses are watered before feeding and in others , after feeding . Salt is not given to horses with any regularity or in sufficient quantities . Animals are frequently seen licking up urine and even feces and dirt in their search for salt . Salt is scarce and very expensive in many areas , so that many of the people can not afford to buy salt , either for their animals or themselves . Night blindness is reported to be common in Kweichow and adjacent regions , indicating a possible deficiency of vitamin A. In general , horses are produced in the more remote areas such as on mountain ranges and in the grasslands of the west and northwest . From these areas the excess males move into the more heavily cultivated areas and into commercial use . Hence , there is a preponderance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where most horses are used for draft purposes . Most animals are apparently sold at private treaty and at the large livestock markets that are held occasionally in certain areas . Tea bricks are frequently used for purchase instead of cash in the more remote areas . By-products of the horse are obviously few . The hides of dead or injured animals are usually salvaged for leather and in some areas bones may be gathered up and sold for use in fertilizer . Hunts for wild horses are sometimes organized to obtain hides for leather and skins of legs for cruppers.  | Breeding No data are available on the age of puberty , but there are apparent differences in the rate of sexual development . Stallions of the Sining type are said to be ready for active service when 2 to 3 years of age , while Mongolian stallions from Ningsia and Suiyuan are said to be not ready for service until 3 or 4 years old . Where hand-breeding is practiced , mares are usually bred for the first time at 2 or 3 years of age , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever age they first come in estrus . Very few data are available on the duration of estrus and length of the estrous cycle . These are estimated to be 2 to 5 days and 18 to 25 days , respectively , in different areas . The percentage of pregnancies obtained during a breeding season is variously estimated at 20 to 80 percent . It is probable that the average for the country is below 50 percent . The breeding season extends front February to October , with the bulk of ) at the First Horse Breeding Station , near Wukung in Shensi , show the following distribution of breedings of farmers ' mares that were brought to the station for service in 1942 : Table In Sikong , it is reported that most mares are bred during June and July . These are the first months when the supply of green grass is good after the winter season . Accurate data on length of pregnancy are not available but it is about 11 months , according to most observers . In most areas the foal is allowed to run with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tibetan areas such as the Lihua plateau , foals are blanketed for a month or so after birth to protect them from abrupt temperature changes that are common at this high altitude . When hand-breeding is practiced , mares may be hobbled with a rope which goes around the rear legs above the hocks , passes forward either between or to one side of the front legs , and is tied around the neck . This provides some restraint , but a vigorous mare can kick a stallion if she resents his advances . In some areas , southern Shensi for example , the farmer insists on having the cervix of the mare " opened up " by hand before service . This practice is also common in other countries , but there is no evidence that it serves any purpose other than to provide an extra chance for introducing infection . In Kweichow some farmers make a practice of breeding their mares three days after foaling , whether in estrus or not . Evidence in other  | countries indicates that foal estrus occurs about nine days after foaling , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foal heat occurs earlier in certain Chinese horses , this should be definitely determined . In any event , it is sounder practice to delay breeding until the first estrus following the foal estrus , thus giving the uterus time to clean out and be in better condition to begin another pregnancy . Many males are left intact even though they are not to be used for breeding . This is especially true in South China where males of the South China pony type are seldom gelded , but the practice is prevalent in other regions . Most males that are not used for breeding at the Ministry of War 's horse stations are gelded . In the grasslands where horses are run in herds , the usual practice is to supply 1 stallion for every 10 mares . In Sikong and other grassland provinces , most of the good stallions are owned by the ruling class or by the lamaseries . The French apparently brought 100 stallions ( probably of Arab or Barb extraction ) to the northeast in 1900 , from North Africa . These were dispersed in 1907 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no organized breeding program was followed , their influence was diffused and absorbed into the native blood , where traces of their influence can still be seen . Russian horses of uncertain origin have been used in the border areas of Sinkiang , Outer Mongolia , and Manchuria and have brought about some increase in size . No definite breeding plan has been followed , and no clear-cut information is available on the results obtained . Fifty Russian stallions ( probably Orloff Trotter and extractions from this breed ) were brought into Sinkiang in 1937 , and it is reported that their progeny have greater size and strength than the native horses . Arabians have been introduced and used to some extent in the Ministry of War 's horse-breeding program , but no results of this breeding work have been published . Some work has also been done with grade thoroughbreds from Australia , but no results have been published . Some foreign stock , especially some animals for racing , was introduced into coastal cities , but there is no evidence that these animals were used in any planned grading-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of horses produced in those areas . According to the Manchurian Yearbook , the Japanese were using or planning to use Arab , Anglo-Norman , Anglo-Arab , and Hackney horses for some grading-up operations in Manchuria .  | Historically , the donkey was developed and used by the Chinese farmer while the nomads used horses , and this relationship still holds to a considerable extent . As the farmer moved into the edge of the nomad grasslands , he took donkeys with him , and horses gradually filtered into the farming areas . The donkey is probably the most important draft animal in North China . Figure Types Chinese donkeys probably vary more in size than in any other important characteristic . Mature animals vary in height from approximately 90 to 137 cm . For convenience , they may be divided into three  | types : large , intermediate , and small . There is no clear-cut line of demarcation between these ; one type blends into another . The legs are apparently shorter in relation to height in the smaller types . The large-type donkeys are found primarily in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these are also found in Manchuria , Figure where they have apparently been taken by emigrants from Shantung and adjacent areas , and intermediate ones are also found in that area . The small type is the predominating type in Sikong but is also found to some extent in almost all areas where donkeys are used . The number of donkeys in Sikong is relatively small . The donkeys in Ningsia also are predominantly of the small type . The intermediate type appears to predominate in many of the other areas where donkeys are found in large numbers . There is wide variation in the quality of animals within the three  | size groups . Some have reasonably well-developed necks , with the head carried fairly high , medium development of withers , straight backs , level croups , reasonably deep bodies , and fairly straight legs . Others have some or most of the faults that are the opposite of the more desirable characteristics listed above . Crooked rear legs are especially common . Colors usually seen include buckskin ( various shades of dun with dark stripe down the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of brown , some being almost black , with lighter color on the underside . Black and white are seen occasionally . Albinos are rare . Data on performance are very scanty . Pack trains usually cover 35 to 40 kilometers per day , but the better animals may cover as many as 55 kilometers . Loads for animals of the intermediate type usually vary from 80 to 100 kilos . Some donkeys have short , smooth coats , while others have long and rather rough coats . Others are intermediate . Long coats are most common in the small type . Management and Feeding The large-type donkeys are used primarily for draft purposes on farms and in commercial transportation and also as sires in mule production . The intermediate and small types are both used for farm work , for riding , and for packing . Housing , harness and other equipment , and methods of management are very similar to those described for horses . It is generally conceded that the donkey can exist with less feed and care than the horse , and this reputed ability is frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is different from that used with horses is the habit of sitting on the hips of the donkey when riding , so that the rider feels the movements of only the rear legs . Feeding practices are essentially the same as those described for horses . In southern China some farmers give their jacks two eggs for each time they are allowed service . Breeding Breeding practices are similar to those described for horses . The donkeys differ in having a longer pregnancy , which is estimated to be about 12 months . Estrus is also said to be easier to detect in Chinese jennets than in mares . Many jacks apparently breed either mares or jennets with equal desire . Jacks that are accustomed to serving jennets are frequently hesitant about serving mares , but little difficulty is reported where the jack is used first for serving mares.  | The distribution of mules in China is similar to that of donkeys . Types There are no clear-cut types , the most important variation being that of size . The mares that produce them vary somewhat in size Figure  | and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of the larger , stronger mules stand as high as 137 to 142 cm. and have reasonably good conformation . Manchurian mules are reported in the Manchurian Yearbook to vary from 1.3 to 1.6 meters in height . Data obtained on mules in use on the highway at Yungchang , Szechwan , in the summer of 1943 , indicate the size of animals in use in that area . These data , supplied by Hsu ( 1943 ) , are summarized below : Table The estimated age of the males ranged from 2 to 10 years and up , and that of the females from 2 to 10 . The two geldings were 6 and 15 years of age . The chief deficiencies observed in mules are that they are frequently too light in body and bone for draft purposes ; and short straight shoulders , sloping croups , light muscling , and crooked rear legs are also frequently observed . The major portion of the large mules is produced in the Wei and lower Yellow River Valleys . Shensi and Shantung are both noted for the production of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suiyuan and Manchuria . Mules are also produced in other areas , but these have become noted as the more important centers of production . Data on pulling power and other items of performance are not available . In packing , it is customary to load mules with 10 to 20 kilos more than is placed on horses of equal size . In commercial transportation , the larger , stronger mules are usually used as wheel animals in the heavy carts . These carts are usually loaded with 11/2 to 13/ tons and the wheel animal bears the major portion of the punishment in handling the load . Some of the larger mules are quite satisfactory for riding purposes and are especially useful in rough country . Many mules are good walkers and some have a very satisfactory running walk . This type of gait is seen frequently in Ningsia and is also found in other areas . In marshy country , mules are not as satisfactory as horses because they are more apt to bog down , owing to their smaller feet . Management and Feeding The mule is used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , for pulling light carts , and for riding . The larger mules are much sought after for commercial transportation , but some are  | used on farms and for other purposes . Medium-sized animals are used for all purposes , while the smaller ones find their greatest usefulness on the smaller farms and for packing . Housing , feeding , and other practices are similar to those described for horses . Breeding Mules do not reproduce , except in rare cases ; hence there are no breeding problems with mules themselves . The practice of leaving many males intact is similar to that for horses and donkeys , owing to the belief that the intact male is a better work animal than the , gelded one . Certain provinces have reputations as mule-production centers , and the source of mares differs in the different areas . Breeders in Shantung buy many mares from Inner Mongolia for this purpose . In Shensi some of the mares are produced at home while others are purchased from Kansu and some from Inner Mongolia . In mule-producing areas , the service charge for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and around Wukung , Shensi , the service charge for the large jacks is about three bushels of grain . The farmers in this area are anxious to breed mares to jacks for mule production , and in order to encourage the breeding for horse production , the First Horse Breeding Station makes no service charge for stallions and one third the regular local rate for jacks . Improvement of the mule is dependent upon improvement of horses and donkeys . Discussions of the need for improving the horse for work and for providing mares to produce mules are frequently heard , but the need for improvement . of donkeys is usually overlooked , the lowly donkey being merely taken for granted .  | The area in which camels are produced and used is outlined on the map in figure 24 . It includes Sinkiang , Outer Mongolia , most of Inner Mongolia , and portions of Jehol , Kansu , Chinghai , and the edge of Tibet . Caravans travel outside this area and occasionally go as far south as Chengtu , Szechwan . Figure Types Practically all the camels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type , or dromedary , is said to exist in Sinkiang , where it has probably been brought in the normal course of commerce with regions to the west . It is reported that there are a few singlehumped camels in Manchuria .  | There are no distinct types or breeds , and there has been no attempt to develop or isolate any specific type or types . In general , compact , low-set , massive , well-muscled animals are desired . Colors range from dark brown to very light dun or cream . Some are nearly white . Figure  | A purplish red color is said to be most desired in some areas . A white blaze or spot on the forehead or face is unpopular since it is supposed to bring bad luck . No weights or measurements are available on Chinese camels , but mature animals are said to measure from about 150 to 210 cm. at the top of the hump . One large camel that was slaughtered is reported to have yielded 235 kilos of meat . Accurate data on working capacity are likewise unavailable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day on long trips and up to 85 kilometers on short trips in 24 hours . The strongest camels carry 275 kilos and cover 1,150 kilometers in 30 days . Camels of average size and strength may carry about 140 kilos at the beginning of the working season but only 120 at the end . In some areas such as Ningsia the average load is reported to be about 115 to 140 kilos . Cross ( 1917 ) gives some figures on the loads for camels in India that are interesting for comparison with the previous figures obtained from camel-owners in China . He states that the load allowed on government camels is 182 kilos , but that natives load as heavily as 270 to 360 kilos . He reports that the strongest camels can carry up to 435 kilos . These loads are apparently for dromedaries . Cross also states that camels can walk at the rate of 21 miles ( about 4.2 kilometers ) per hour and if at continuous work should not be allowed to cover more than 20 to 25 kilometers per day , and he recommends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ningsia are reported to travel about 2 miles an hour with packs . Cross also states that a good riding camel can travel at the rate of 6 to 7 miles ( about 10 to 12 kilometers ) per hour and cover up to 100 or 115 kilometers in a stretch . If at continual work they can average 50 kilometers per day for several days . Camel 's hair or wool is used for making blankets , certain clothing materials , and other textiles . It is fine in the young animal and of relatively poor quality from old animals . The price in northwest China is reported by Chang ( 1941 ) to be three times that of sheep 's wool . The average yield is said to be about 2.4 kilos , but large animals yield as much as 3.5 kilos . The production of camel 's wool in Manchuria was reported ( Wang , 1942 ) to be 71,419 pounds in 1937 . The estimated number of camels was 12,800 . If these figures are accurate , then the yield per head was about 5.6 pounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since shearing results in too-sudden change and camels may become ill . Shedding begins in April and is complete by about the end of May . The wool falls out in bunches and is picked up , or it may be pulled out when it loosens . The stealing of wool by children , by pulling it out when caravan camels are resting , is common in some areas . Camel 's wool is soft but is uneven in fine-  | ness and is apparently difficult to spin since most of the yarn seen on the market is uneven and bunchy . The milk of the camel is similar to cow 's milk . Chang ( 1941 ) gives the following comparative figures : Table Production figures are not available on Chinese camels , but milking females are frequently taken on trips to supply milk for the travelers . Cross states that Indian camels give as much as 1 to 2 gallons at 1 or 2 weeks after parturition and continue lactation for 8 months under desert conditions and up to 18 months under conditions of good feed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Camel manure serves as fuel on the desert after it dries . Camel meat is also eaten in some areas but is not palatable to many people . It is said to be rather coarse and dark in color . Management and Feeding The primary use of the camel is for transport of goods and for riding in semi-desert and desert areas . Wool , milk , skin , meat , etc. , are merely by-products of this main function . Camels usually start to work at about 4 years of age . They may be used for riding from 3 or 4 years to 5 or 6 years and then put to work in caravans . They are reported to be used for work until 16 to 22 years of age and may live to about 30 years . Cross states that Indian camels may be put at light work at 4 years , but that some poorer owners start working them at 2 or 3 years . He believes that they should not be worked until 5 years of age . He states that a camel is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a total of 6 to 19 years and longer if conditions of feed and management are good . Leonard ( 1894 ) claims that camels should not be worked until 6 or 7 years of age . The training process is simple . A bamboo ring or a straight stick with a knob on one end and with the lead rope fastened at the other end is placed in the nose of young camels . They soon become accustomed to it and are easily led , following older camels . They must be accustomed to loads very slowly and with only light loads at first , else they become balky . They often object to being loaded and some develop a habit of kicking with the front feet ( striking ) , particularly the males . Such animals may have a red rag tied on the forelock to identify  | them . Some have vile tempers . Males are apt to be dangerous during the breeding season , and it is often necessary to muzzle them at this time . One man handles seven or eight camels in caravans . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tandem from the nose ring to the pack in front . Only a very small rope is needed if the animals are gentle . Shoe leather may be sewed to the pads of the feet to prevent injury to the feet when traveling or to protect feet that have worn thin from travel . Packsaddles like those used on horses and cattle are not used on camels . Instead the packsaddle consists of two bags , made of wool and filled with straw , which are placed along either side of the animal 's back . Either one or two wooden bars or poles are fastened to each bag , running along the side of the body . The bags , with poles attached , are held in place by ropes which pass around the body . A piece of felt may be placed over this equipment . The load is divided into two equal parts and one half is attached to the pole or poles on each side . The load may be in sacks or in the form of bales depending on the nature of the material being carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This allows them to fatten so they are in condition to work during the remainder of the year . Humps become thin and fall over during the winter but fatten and become erect during the summer grazing season . Grazing in the higher areas also enables them to miss the worst of the summer heat . While working they get some grass by grazing during the day . Other roughage includes wheat , rice , oats , and millet straws . The straw is chopped into about two-inch lengths . Peas are the only commonly used concentrate . These are cracked ( coarse ) and soaked in water before feeding . Camels require considerable salt , which is usually spread on grass for them to pick up . No salt is given while on summer range . Water is given once daily , in the morning . It is said that camels can go without water for three days without suffering because " they store water in their humps " . There is no direct evidence for this popular belief . One study indicates that the camel is probably able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively large amount of water produced as an end-product of metabolic processes in the body . Wang ( 1941 ) states that the hump is composed of a connective tissue network and adipose tissue . Wang describes the digestive organs of the camel and points out that the rumen has two " water bags " or outpocketings which are not found in other ruminants . He mentions that the contents of these bags are moist or liquid and similar to the contents of the reticulum . It seems probable that the name " water bag "  | may be an improper designation which indicates a supposed function that may not exist . Camels are frequently worked at night , in order to avoid the daytime heat . The camel has 34 permanent teeth , but writers differ on the classification of these . Wang ( 1941 ) lists 2 incisors , 2 canines , 6 pre-molars , and 6 molars in the upper jaw ; and 6 incisors , 2 canines , 4 pre-molars , and 6 molars in the lower jaw . Cross lists 6 canines and 10 molars in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 8 molars in the lower jaw . Figure Cross ( 1917 ) also outlines the relation of teeth changes to age , as follows : 2 temporary incisors appear at 5 to 12 days , and by 1 year there are 6 temporary incisors . By 4 years these are worn to the roots . At 5 years there are 2 permanent incisors , at 6 years there are 4 , and at 7 years there are 6 . The first canines appear at 8 years , and after this , age changes can be detected to some extent by the amount of wear . Some camel 's wool is used by the local people for hand-spinning and hand-weaving . Before the war , most of the wool from Inner Mongolia that was not used locally went to Tientsin for export . Wool from Sinkiang probably goes primarily to the U.S.S.R. Some camel 's wool comes to such centers as Sining and especially Lanchow , from where it is distributed to various manufacturers in the area ; and some of it goes as far as Chungking.  | No specialized marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most part at private treaty . The best animals in northern Kansu are valued at about $100 ( silver ) while average animals are valued at about $80 . Wool goes through about the same channels as sheep 's wool , and little attempt is made to grade it , to properly package it , or to sell it on a quality basis . In Ningsia camel 's wool is sorted by hand into three grades or degrees of fineness . Breeding Data on breeding practices are very scanty . The breeding season is reported by some to be from August to October and by others to be as late as January . Clear-cut information on estrus , length of the estrous cycle , and duration of pregnancy under Chinese conditions is lacking . Pregnancy is estimated by different men to be from 12 to 17 months , but the most reliable estimates place it at 12 to 13 months . Young are apparently born in the late winter and early spring , in most areas . The females usually produce young every second year . One breeder in Kansu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season produced young and that 50 percent of those bred had young alive at weaning . Reports from Ningsia indicate that the level of fertility is not as high as 80 percent , but the death losses are much less frequent than the foregoing figures indicate . Single births are the rule and twins are very rare . Young camels are reported by one owner to be weaned at 3 months if the dam is working , but , if idle , weaning may be delayed until 6 months . It is said that the young graze readily by 2 months of age . Weaning at 8 months or later appears to be a more common practice , and in Ningsia females do little work and the common practice in some areas is to leave intact 1 male for each 10 females . The method of castration is similar to that in other animals , which is to make incisions in the scrotum with a knife , pull out the testes , and sever the cord with a knife . It was reported by one owner that this operation was done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still in the abdomen at 6 months of age . Males usually run with the herd . Before copulation , the male forces the female to the ground by biting or pressing on the neck . He then mounts , but in a sitting position with the hocks on the ground . This position in mating is necessary apparently because of the structure of the reproductive tract and sheath , which opens backwards . Cross ( 1917 ) gives some information on breeding practices with camels in India that are interesting for comparison . He states that the duration of the first pregnancy is usually about 12 months and 20 days , and that later pregnancies are usually just a few days over 12  | months . Females usually produce young every second year but occasionally breed again about six months after parturition . He suggests December and early January as the best time to breed under Indian conditions . The percentage of infertility is reported to be very low . He states that females are usually bred first at 4 years , but if well fed will show estrus at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and sometimes beyond this age . He describes the vulva as being slightly swollen during estrus , and the female as being nervous and seeking the male . He reports that the act of copulation requires about 15 minutes , and that other camels gather around and protect the pair while they are mating . The process of parturition is described as rather difficult and he cites the necessity of tying the female when labor begins so she will not run and injure the young . The placenta usually comes with the young or within one-half hour afterward . Cross also states that the young should be weaned by 15 months or the next lactation will be short . He says that one male can breed 30 to 50 females , but that 30 is the best number . He recommends that males not be used for breeding before about 8 years of age . Castration is also recommended , but he points out that bone and body development will not be adequate if this is done before 6 years . Leonard ( 1894 ) states that females suckle their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in estrus during this period . He states that one young is produced every three years by a female , and that one male can serve 15 to 50 females , but he recommends 16 as the optimum number . He also claims that females should not do any work during gestation or lactation or at all events for a year after birth . He claims that there is frequently great mortality among newly-born camels owing to working the dams during gestation , weaning the young too soon , and working the dams too soon thereafter .  | All cattle in China are commonly referred to as " yellow cattle " , a term which distinguishes them from water buffalo and yak . Types The cattle of China may be divided into two main classes , the Mongolian cattle of the northern and northwestern regions and the draft Figure cattle of the farming areas of central and southern China . It is probable that a third classification is needed for the small cattle of the Tibetan plateau regions . The Mongolian cattle are light-boned and light-muscled , being some-  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are reputed to be somewhat better milk producers than the heavier draft animals but their production is not sufficiently high to characterize them as dairy animals . In color , they are quite variable . Some are black , some brown , some yellow , and there is some white spotting . Many brindle animals are also seen . Figure Kislovsky ( 1938 ) described the cattle of Outer Mongolia as being a distinct type from European cattle or the cattle of southern Asia . He described the type as non-specialized and primitive and weighing about 275 kilos on the average . Wide variations were observed in dimensions , color , and markings . The draft animals of central and southern China are of a more muscular type than the Mongolian cattle and resemble dual-purpose cattle in general conformation . The most common color is yellow but there are some browns , and in some areas various shades of red are Figure  | seen . Blacks are also seen but are not desired . Farmers have a saying , " Ten blacks , nine lazy " . Another color is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shoulders , hump , and backline are yellowish brown and the remainder of the body is black . This ig most distinct in the spring , and in the autumn these parts turn black or nearly so , except for the forehead and shoulders . The animals in the Wei and lower Yellow River Valleys are of a large type and some large-type animals are found in the southeastern portion of Szechwan and adjacent regions of Hupeh , Hunan , and Kweichow . The animals in other portions of the southern region are predominantly of a small type . There are marked variations within the type found in any given area . In the Wei and lower Yellow River Valleys , for example , there Figure  | are at least two distinct types . The animals in southern Shensi are large and well muscled and quite massive in conformation . The predominant color is a reddish brown . The animals in Honan are taller but are not as heavy since they are much thinner-bodied when viewed from front or rear . They are quite deep-bodied and have long legs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighter in color than the Wei Valley cattle , being more of a dark yellow tinged with brown . The Mongolian cattle have no hump but most of the cattle in the south have a small hump on the top of the shoulder . One gets the impression that the size of the hump tends to decrease as one travels Figure  | from the southern to the northern portion of this southern region , but this may be due partially to the custom of leaving more of the males intact in the south and castrating a somewhat greater portion of them farther north . There is considerable variation in the size of the hump in any given area . The following measurements indicate something of the size of cattle in Hunan , Kweichow , and Szechwan : Table The height was taken at the top of the withers and the length from the shoulder point to the pinbone . The following measurements were obtained by Hsu ( 1940 ) of animals winning prizes in an exhibition in Tzetung , Szechwan : Table Most of the cattle in Tibet , Sikong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and light-muscled . In general conformation they are more nearly like the Mongolian than the South China draft cattle . However , the conformation and color patterns are similar to hill cattle found on the southern slopes of the HiniaHunan ( Chang , 1943 ) . . Kweichow ( Chen , 1943 ) . Szechwan ( Huan , 1943 ) .  | Figure layas and in northern India and Bhutan , and it is possible that the cattle of the two areas are related . Data on milk production of native cattle are very scanty . Liang ( 1943 ) gives the following average figures on 10 yellow cattle of Szechwan : Table Management and Feeding Cattle are used primarily as draft animals on farms and as pack animals in commercial transportation . The water buffalo is the primary source of draft power on farms where rice is grown , although cattle are used to some extent in the rice fields .

Milk is rarely used in southern China except in the larger cities , but in the northern areas many cows are milked . The stronger draft oxen can pull a load of 450 to 650 kilos , but the average load is about 200 kilos , and they can cover 15 to 20 kilometers per day . Pack oxen are usually loaded with from 60 to 80 kilos , but the load varies with the size and strength of the animals and the distance to be covered per day . Shelter for cattle may be provided in the farmer 's own living quarters . This is true in the lower Yangtze River Valley , for example ,  | and the quarters are kept quite clean , the droppings being cleaned up at frequent intervals . In some sections it is not uncommon for the farmer and part of his family to sleep just over the cattle , as a protection from theft and possibly as a source of warmth in winter . If separate shelter is provided , as it is in many areas , it is never far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either at the rear or side of the house , and is walled in by earthen or other fences . In areas where lumber is cheap the animals may stand on slats so that the excreta collect underneath , or they may stand on boards which are covered with leaves or grass to soak up the urine . New layers are put on daily and the whole collection is cleaned out at intervals . In other areas soil is the material most commonly used for bedding . In some areas the barn has a pit in which urine collects . This pit may be at the side of the barn , and in northeastern Hunan it is often built under a wooden floor upon which the cattle stand . The harness for draft cattle is quite simple . It consists of a bent wooden stick placed in front of the wither to serve as a yoke , with a rope or strap passing from each end under the throat . Traces are also attached to each end which pull the load . There are some variations in the details of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design . Packsaddles are similar in design to those described for horses and are made in two sections . The base of the saddle is of wood and rests on either side of the backbone , with a pad to protect the skin . This is designed to hold the second portion in place , which is a framework to which the load is attached , so it can be placed on or taken off the animal without moving the base of the saddle . Long sacks filled with grain may be placed across the back without the support of a saddle . This practice is common in the northwest . Animals are driven almost entirely by voice and whip . Cows kept for family milk supply in the north or for marketing milk are generally milked twice daily , except in dairies , where they may be milked three times . Many native cows will not let down the milk unless the calf is present and some will not let down the milk unless the calf is first allowed to nurse to start the milk flow . With some , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the milking process , for the cow will let down milk only for a short time after nursing the calf . In such cases the calf is kept tied near at hand and is allowed to nurse just long enough to start the flow of milk , after which it is pulled away . In areas where milk is sold , the calves are kept on starvation diets , being allowed just enough milk to keep them alive to be available to stimulate the milk flow ; they are either killed or allowed to die when no longer needed for this purpose . The level of feeding even when they are allowed to grow is usually too low for normal development . In range areas the calves may be tied away  | from the cows at night , used to stimulate the milk flow in the morning , and after milking allowed to run with the cows all day . They are tied up again in the evening and the cow milked again to get such milk as was not taken by the calf . In the farming area , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autumn is grass and weeds that are cut from along the edges of the fields and from rough areas , such as the many burial grounds where no crops are raised . Since labor is cheaper than fertilizer , this grass is carried to the cattle so the manure can be saved for farm use . During the winter , rice or other straw is fed , along with such green soilage as may be obtainable . During the busy working season such concentrates as corn , horse beans , and bran are fed , and eggs are sometimes given , mixed with other feed . Other concentrates used to some extent for cattle feed in the areas where they are available are soybeans , soybean cake , sesame cake , cottonseed cake , rapeseed cake , barley , kaoliang , millet , soybean milk , and dregs from the making of soybean curd . The amounts of concentrates given in most areas are small . In the grassland areas the animals live on the range throughout the year . Some supplemental roughage and concentrates may be given to them during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farming is done , or to pack animals that are used in commercial transportation , but for the most part the cattle in these areas obtain practically all their feed by grazing . Animals that are not working are kept in the lower valleys during the winter and on the higher mountain slopes during the warmer season . Feed during the winter and early spring is inadequate and animals become weak , thus being susceptible to disease and unable to endure undue hardships . If a heavy snow covers the grass for a few days , death losses are heavy . Dairy cattle are usually barn-fed the year round . Grass is cut during the warm seasons , and straw ( wheat or millet in the north and rice in the south ) is the chief roughage during the winter . Straw is usually cut into short lengths and mixed with concentrates for feeding . In milder areas , such as around Chungking , it is possible to cut grass throughout the year . Liang ( 1943 ) gives some data on the amount of grass that can be cut by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year was 315.5 catties ( catty equals one-half kilo or 1.1 pound ) . The amount that can be cut is highest in July ( 411.6 catties ) and lowest in February ( 178 catties ) . Liang ( 1943 ) also reports the average amount of grass eaten by a cow during a seven-day trial in April . This test included eight cows , and the average consumption per head per day was 102.3 catties . Thus it would require about one man to gather grass for each three cows  | under conditions in the dairy where the cows were as well fed as existing conditions permitted . The average daily consumption of grass by milking cows throughout the year was 70.6 catties , or 5.53 catties per pound of milk produced during a one-year period . In rainy weather and in the winter when grass was scanty , some rice straw , hay , and carrots were used to supplement hay . Milking cows were fed 9.74 pounds of concentrate mixture per head daily , on the average , or 0.72 pound of concentrate per pound of milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cows , heifers , and bulls received 4.09 pounds per head daily , on the average . Grazing of cattle around villages may be handled in three ways . Some individual in each family may be responsible for the cow or cattle belonging to that family . In some villages one man will contract to care for all the animals in the village while they are grazing and is paid so much per head by the owners . In other villages a rotation system is worked out , so that each family or some member of it is responsible on certain days for handling all the cattle in the village while out grazing . Cattle may be marketed throughout the year , but the major portion are sold at two seasons , spring and autumn . In the spring there is a preponderance of cows and calves on the market , while in the autumn there are more bulls and oxen . In general , more animals are marketed in the autumn than in the spring . During the main marketing seasons a cattle-marketing day occurs every few days . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vary from time to time , and the size of the market will vary in different areas . In Szechwan , there are usually about 100 animals offered for sale on a market day . On the average , there is one cattle market per hsien ( county ) in the cattle-producing areas . Sales in these markets are usually arranged by middlemen or commission men who function also as tax collectors . These men collect a certain portion of the selling price , usually about 5 percent , a part of which is tax and the rest is their commission . There is often no set tax in terms of percent . The commission man must pay a certain amount to the local government each year , and any he collects in addition is his income . The commission fee is collected entirely from the seller in some markets , while in other parts it may be collected from both the seller and the buyer . In many of these markets there is every opportunity for the commission man to squeeze . Bargaining is done in the sleeve , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hence the buyer frequently pays more than the seller receives and the middleman gets the difference plus the regular commission . In other areas this dishonesty is avoided by posting the price . The commission man , in addition to  | setting the price , often insures the animal against death for a short period ? in most cases 5 to 7 days . Some animals are also sold at private treaty , - outside the regular livestock markets . Before the present war , modern dairies existed in the larger coastal and other eastern cities and milk was marketed in a modern manner , with some inspection to guarantee purity of product , from the standpoint of both adulteration and infection . Most dairies in the interior are not well equipped owing to present conditions , and inspection systems have not been developed . Watering of milk is practically an accepted practice , and rigid steps will be necessary to stamp out this extremely bad custom . Deliveries are usually made by men on foot or on bicycles . Bottles are not uniform in size and are frequently under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diluted product but less than he pays for . Milk is usually cooled by ice or cold water , depending upon the area . Some dairies pasteurize in order to better preserve the milk but advise customers to boil it before using . Boiling of milk before use is a necessary practice throughout China . The house-to-house peddling of milk , the cow being milked at each stop , is still a practice in some areas . A limited amount of butter is made and sold around the larger cities . It is packaged in stoneware jars or wrapped in paper . In the grassland area there is little marketing of milk , most of it being used for drinking or for the production of butter and casein . Butter is made in simple wooden churns , or by putting the milk inside a cattle or yak skin and rocking it back and forth until the churning is complete . The butter is then stored in wooden containers for winter use or may be packed in sheep or goat stomachs for marketing . It is very rancid before reaching a market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas where lamaseries are found goes to these lamaseries , where it serves as fuel in the candle pots . Lamas also use butter for carving many fancy images that are used for one day at a sere , mony in the early spring . Much butter is also used for mixing with tea for drinking in Tibetan areas . Casein is made from the milk left after churning , by boiling to coagulate the protein and then putting this material out in the sun to dry . Most of this is used for food during the winter and the whey is fed to the calves . Butter is also used by Tibetans as a skin lotion to protect against the wind and to treat sores and burns , to soften animals skins , as a waterrepelling agent on clothing made from textiles , and as a hair dressing . Part of the leg bones of cattle are used for toothbrush handles . Six bones are suitable for this purpose , and 4 handles can be made from each , or a total of 24 from each animal . The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from bone or are pulverized into bonemeal . Hair from cattle is woven into ropes and is also used for making blankets . Skins are used for leather and may be . tanned with tannin from natural sources or with certain chemicals . Smoke-tanning is also done in some areas , by smoking the individual skins over fire boxes which are stoked from the top with straw to produce a maximum amount of smoke . Cattle skins from adult animals average about four kilos in weight when dried . Breeding Little is known of the age of puberty . This is conditioned to some extent by the plane of nutrition , and it is generally believed that the cattle of northern China reach puberty a little later than those of the southern portion , and that males reach puberty a little later than females . Bulls are said to be ready for service at 21/2 years . Some females are reported to show estrus at 10 to 12 months of age but are seldom bred before 14 to 20 months . Signs of estrus are not usually marked , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cow to know when she is in estrus . Definite data on the length of estrus and the estrous cycle are not available , but the duration of estrus is reported to be about 1 to 2 days and the estrous cycle from 18 to 21 days , and sometimes shorter or longer . The length of pregnancy is reported by Chen ( 1943 ) to vary from 268 to 309 days in Kweichow , while Huan ( 1943 ) gives a range of 270 to 285 days under southeastern Szechwan conditions . Liang ( 1943 ) gives the average of 26 gestations in native cows as 278.3 days with a standard error of 1.4 days . The breeding season is quite variable . Most animals are either bred in the spring or autumn , with summer ranking next , and the smallest number are bred in the winter . In the grasslands and in some farm areas tie males run with the females and breeding is done whenever a female is in estrus . In many farm areas hand-mating is practiced . In such areas one member of a village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a charge is made for the service . Most bulls that are to be worked on farms are castrated . This operation is sometimes performed at 6 months but may be delayed to as late as 4 years . Castration is done , without any antiseptic precautions , by the use of a sharp knife . An incision is made either lengthwise or crosswise to the long axis of the scrotum and the testes squeezed out . The cord is cut with knife or scissors . In some areas eggs are fed to bulls when giving service . Two eggs per service may be given . In Hunan , it is reported that some farmers  | feed bulls small fish and shrimp to supply protein . There is also a practice in some areas of giving the cow wine after each service , with the belief that she is more apt to settle if this is done . There is evidence in other countries ( Phillips , et al. , 1943 ) that the level of fertility may decrease during the summer months , owing to the high environmental temperatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least in southern China . Liang 's data ( 1943 ) from Chungking are as follows : Table In many areas in China it is reported that cows frequently come in estrus during pregnancy . Liang observed this phenomenon three times in 26 pregnancies in native cows , or in approximately 12 percent of the cases . Practically all the cattle imported into China have been of dairy type . According to the 1936 Chinese Yearbook , the numbers of dairy cattle in the country were as follows : Holstein , 2,607 ; Ayrshire , 171 ; Guernsey , 138 ; Jersey , 102 . Other breeds have been imported in very limited numbers . There is a report that some Brown Swiss bulls were recently brought to Sinkiang from Russia . Before the outbreak of the present war the dairy industry had made some progress in Nanking , Tsingtao , Tientsin , Peking , Canton , and other cities , and especially in Shanghai . At the outbreak of the war the cattle belonging to Central University and to Revolutionary Heroes Descendant School were moved to Chungking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Madame Chiang Kaishek , under the supervision of Frank Dickinson , West China Union University , Chengtu . Dairies in other cities were destroyed ox confiscated by the Japanese . Considerable progress has been made in Chungking and Chengtu and in some other areas during the war . Purebred dairy animals have been used in commercial dairies and by a few individuals , and purebred bulls have been used for grading up native cows in some communities . Few data have been recorded to show the results of this grading up , or the performance of the purebred animals under Chinese conditions as compared with the conditions in countries from which they were imported . Liang ( 1943 ) gives some data on this problem and these are summarized below . Body Items Compared  | size as indicated by various measurements was determined on a small number of native cows and on grades in the herd , and some of the averages are as follows : Table In general appearance the first-generation grades possess much of the beefiness of the native cows , but later generations are more refined and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not available on native cows , but there has been a progressive increase in size as the amount of Holstein blood in the grades increased , as indicated by the following figures for birth weight : Table The color of Holstein grades is of some interest and the results in the Chungking Dairy may be summarized briefly as follows . Of 50 first-generation cows , none were all black but 49 showed more black than white , and 1 was approximately half black and half white . Of 56 second-generation animals ( 3/4 Holstein ) , 2 were black , 32 had more black than white , 7 were about half and half , and 15 had more white than black . Nine third-generation animals ( 7/s Holstein ) were divided as follows : 3 with more black than white ; 3 , half and half ; and 3 with more white than black . Three brown animals have occurred in the first generation since this tabulation was made . These results are not necessarily typical of what would be expected with other native cattle or with other foundation Holstein stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his herd that is reddish yellow and white , and animals of similar color have occurred in the grades in the Central University herd . These cases may be due to the presence of a recessive red-color gene in the bulls  | The production of Holsteins , natives and grades , as reported by Liang ( 1943 ) is summarized below : Table The lactation periods are given in days and the milk yields in pounds . The fat-percentage figures are for slightly different groups of cows , including 10 , 52 , 29 , and 6 cows ; and 10 , 434 , 230 , and 53 samples , respectively . More data are needed as a basis for determining production of native cows and of higher-grade cows . Hsu ( 1943 ) collected some data on native cattle and on Holstein X yellow-cattle crosses in Kwangsi . Animals were tested at 10-day intervals for a period of 2 months during November and December . These animals calved during the previous months of August and September , with the exception of one Kwangsi yellow cow that calved the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the native cows . Three yellow cows from Kwangsi averaged 9.1 percent fat while three from Kiangsi averaged 7.9 percent . Two Holstein grades averaged 5.8 percent . The average daily milk production for four testing days ( animals were milked twice daily ) for the individual animals was 515 , 530 , and 675 cc. for the Kwangsi yellow cows ; 444 , 697 , and 1,085 cc. for the Kiangsi native cows ; and 2,651 and 4,835 cc. for the Holstein grades . According to one report ( Wang , 1942 ) Holsteins were being used for grading up in Manchuria . No results are given . Some data that are of interest on level of fertility have been accumulated by Liang ( 1943 ) . These are summarized below : Table The length of gestation was similar in all groups of cows , the averages for the four respective groups listed in the above table being 278.3 , 278.1 , 275.4 , and 277.1 for 26 , 154 , 28 , and 16 pregnancies.  | The results summarized above indicate that the Holsteins and their grades are performing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk production . Fat percentage is reduced as compared with the natives , but this must be anticipated if the level of milk production is to be increased with a breed adapted to market milk production like the Holsteins . Careful observations need to be made under other conditions to determine if the purebreds and grades are standing up well under the local environments . Observations on fertility indicate that the yellow cattle may be superior in fertility , and this point needs careful study as grading-up programs progress . Figure  | The water buffalo , as its name implies , likes water and is able to walk with comparative ease in mud . It is also a quiet-tempered animal . These characteristics make it especially well adapted for use in the rice field , and its distribution in China is limited almost entirely to the rice-producing area . The main use of the water buffalo is for draft power . It is used to a limited extent for milk production in only a few localities . Figure Types There is considerable variation in conformation and in color but there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most common color is usually characterized as black , but it is more nearly a dark slate-gray . There are some tan or " reed-flowered " animals and an occasional white one . Farmers prefer the black ones since they are believed to stand the cold better and be easier to feed in  | the winter . White ones are considered to be unlucky in most regions and are , therefore , found in small numbers in certain limited areas only . Figure  | The water buffalo is of rather heavy , beefy build , on the average . The body is heavy , the chest is deep and fairly wide , the legs short , and the middle large . As compared with cattle , it tends to be somewhat pot-bellied . The bones of the leg are large and fairly strong , although cow-hocked or sickle-hocked hind legs are rather frequent . The chief differences in conformation between it and cattle are the more sloping rump in the water buffalo , along with a shorter tail-head , and the angle at which the head is attached to the neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horizontal plane , while in cattle it is nearer the vertical plane . The horns differ in shape and direction from those of the cattle . They are angular instead of round at the base and extend upward and backward over the neck . There is considerable variation in the direction and degree of bending . In some animals the horns almost form a circle , so that the ends are only about five inches apart , while at the other extreme , the horns extend more to the side and the tips may be two feet apart . Farmers are said to prefer the coiled type in cows and the straighter type in bulls . Hoofs are of two different shapes . One is called the scissor type , in which the toes are long and inconvenient for walking . There is an undue amount of wear on the bottom of the foot , resulting in tenderness and limping . The other type is called the bowl type . The foot is square set , with the pastern at about a 45-degree angle . The hoof wears more evenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of hoof quality are recognized . The most desired is that in which the horn of the hoof is black , since this type has been observed to be tough and to wear well . A second type in which the horn is yellow or waxy in color is not so hard and does not wear as well . The third type is composed of a mixture of black and yellow horn and is said to be intermediate to the first two types in hardness . Some data are available on the sizes of animals in certain provinces , as indicated by body measurements . Data from areas in which are located three of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry 's cattle stations are summarized below : Table  | The length was measured from the shoulder to the end of the pinbone . Hsu ( 1940 ) gives the following measurements on the prize-winning animals at an exhibition held in Tzetung , Szechwan : Table Levine ( 1920 ) states that water buffalo in the Canton area range from 46 to 56 inches ( 116.8 to 142.2 cm. ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 636 kilos ) in weight . Few data are available on the milk and fat production of water buffalo . Hsu ( 1943 ) gives data on six animals in Kwangsi . These data were collected during November and December on animals that had calved during August and September of the same year . Samples were obtained at intervals of 10 days for 2 months for tests of percent butter fat , and these averaged 11.0 percent . The average daily milk yield of 4 animals ( animals were milked twice daily ) at 4 successive testing periods was 605 , 828 , 964 , and 2,317 cc. , respectively . Levine ( 1920 ) states that a water-buffalo dairy was started in Canton in 1905 and that observations indicate a promising future if a program of improvement in milk production is undertaken . Verbal reports indicate that other buffalo dairies were in operation around southeastern coastal cities prior to the war but no data are available on production . Management and Feeding The primary use of water buffalo is as a source of power on farms , and especially on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number are used in the pumping of brine from the salt wells . Some are also used as a source of power for the grinding of sugarcane . They are used to a very limited extent for milk production as a by-product of work . Surplus animals and animals that are no longer suitable for work are sold for meat .  | Data from various sources indicate that the buffalo on the average farm is not used more than about 40 to 50 days per year for farm work . Methods of management are similar to those described for cattle . There are certain differences owing to the buffalo 's liking for water . Where small ponds are available , several animals may be tied around it when not in use or during the night so they can lie in the water and mud . The owner then takes them to a large pond or stream where they can clean off in clear water . Or the buffalo is frequently taken to a stream at the end of a day 's work to allow it to enter the water and cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described for cattle . By-products , such as bone and skins , are used in the same manner as those of cattle . The water-buffalo hide is larger , thicker , and heavier than that of cattle , weighing about 13 catties ( 6.5 kilos ) when dried , for mature animals , as compared with 8 catties ( 4 kilos ) for cattle . Breeding Breeding practices are similar to those outlined for cattle . Little information is available on reproductive phenomena in the water buffalo . Observations indicate that females may first show estrus sometime between 12 and 18 months of age , but breeding is usually delayed until about 2 years of age . Observations also indicate that estrus may last for 2 to 3 days , and that the estrous cycle varies from 18 to 28 days . Actual data are needed on these points . The male is considered ready for service at 3 years but no data are available on the actual age of puberty . Data on pregnancy indicate that it is somewhat longer than in cattle , varying from 300 to 348 days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male are relatively smaller than those in cattle . Slaughter data obtained by Hsu ( 1943 ) show that the average size of the testes , including epididymis and a little other tissue , was 0.069 percent of body weight in water buffalo and 0.106 percent in cattle .  | The yak is indigenous to the mountainous regions of central Asia , and wild herds are still found in some regions . It is well adapted to grazing on steep mountain slopes and for travel in mountainous regions . The pien niu , or hybrid between yellow cattle and yak , is found in practically all the regions where the yak is used . The yak is related to the American bison and is similar to it in many respects . It grunts with a sound more like that of a hog than like the lowing of cattle of western countries . Types There are no distinct types of yak , but there are wide variations in size and color and also some variation in conformation . Figure  | Figure  | Female yaks in Sikong are estimated to average about 109 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1938 ) gives the average height of female yaks in Outer Mongolia as 109 cm . Males are larger on the average and some become quite massive . The pien niu is described by Kislovsky as being larger in all its measurements than either of the parent types and weighing about 18 percent more than cattle . In Sikong it is estimated that pien niu are approximately 20 percent larger than yaks . The yak is not specialized in conformation for either beef or milk production . The legs are rather short and the body relatively heavy . The head is narrow and long , with the forehead relatively wide , and the face usually dished . The front portion of the back is higher than the neck and slopes off toward the rear . The rump is usually sloping , and the tail is short and covered with long hair resembling the tail of a horse more than that of cattle . The chest is deep in relation to height , but the rear quarters tend to be light . The horns are slender and long and curve outward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Outer Mongolia polled animals are preferred , according to Kislovsky , and no horned bulls were observed , all the horned males having been castrated . The hoofs are usually big and strong and well adapted to mountain-climbing or to walking on marshy grasslands . The hair of the yak is longer than that of cattle . Fringes around the poll , at the withers and shoulders , along the flanks and on the thighs grow quite long , giving the animal a very hairy appearance . From this characteristic it receives its Chinese name of mao niu or " hairy cattle " . There is considerable variation in the color of yaks . Black , dark brown , and black with white spots are all frequently seen . Gray and white animals are relatively less frequent . The wild type of pigmentation or agouti is occasionally seen . Kislovsky ( 1938 ) states that about 20 percent of the animals in Outer Mongolia are of solid color , and the remainder show varying degrees of white markings , ending in practically pure white with a few colored specks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tint was observed in 21.5 percent of the cases . Two types of white markings were described . In one , the white is limited to the head , tail , feet , and inguinal region . In the other , the " color-sided " type of piebaldness is found . The pien niu is intermediate to the yak and cattle in conformation , and , as has already been mentioned , is larger and stronger , exhibiting the phenomenon of hybrid vigor . The hair is also intermediate in length . Colors are similar to the yak , but some brown pigmentation is seen , particularly the lighter browns . These shades are seen in animals that are frequently classed as yaks but which carry some yellow-cattle blood .  | Little data are available on the milk-producing ability of the yak . Records being collected at the Pa Mei Livestock Farm in Sikong indicate that under native conditions of feeding and management the yak produces 2.5 to 4 pounds of milk daily for a period of four or five months . Some of the better ones may give a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a rich golden color and the butter also has this color . Kislovsky ( 1938 ) states that the milk yield of the yak is low , but that the fat content is high-6.34 percent , which is apparently an average figure . Figure The pied niu produces more milk than the yak and is generally believed to produce more than yellow cattle . During the early part of lactation the daily production is about 6 pounds , and some individuals may give 10 to 12 pounds . Huang ( 1943 ) reports that an exceptional animal gave 20 pounds daily . The average daily production in the herd in which this animal was maintained was 5 pounds for the lactating animals , and they were milked for about 7 months on the average . Most of the 100 animals in this herd were purchased in Chinghai . Tests of fat percentages made on four animals in Sikong by Lu ( 1943 ) showed an average of 5.6 percent . These animals had freshened in the spring and the data were obtained on July 1 .  | Management and Feeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packing in commercial transportation and also for the carrying of wood and supplies by private individuals . In addition to their use as beasts of burden , they produce milk and thus provide one of the staple sources of food in the high plateau regions . They are also used for meat , and the hides are used for leather . Hair is used for making rope and smaller thread for weaving tents and for other purposes . For the most part the animals are grazed in the vicinity of the villages , or of the nomad tents during the summer months . No supplemental feed is given during the season when grass is obtainable , and no hay is put aside for winter use . In periods of heavy snowfall , especially during the later winter and early spring , losses are frequently heavy , since resistance is low and animals can not survive , many days without feed . In such periods , choice animals are sometimes fed dried casein or other products to keep them alive . In many areas , the ranges are overstocked and there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners allow their animals to graze both day and night , and in areas where it is unsafe to allow the animals to graze alone at night , a guard spends the night with them . Some owners allow grazing only during the day and tie up the animals at night . New-born calves are housed in the yak-hair tents during the night , for safety and also to reserve all the morning milk for human use . The more considerate milkmaids may leave a little for the calves . The calves then follow their dams during the day unless the weather is too stormy . At night the milk not taken by the calf is obtained for human use . In some areas animals are milked only once daily , usually in the morning . Some yak cows are not milked when producing a pien niu calf , in order to let it develop more fully . The practice of allowing the calf to suck just enough to stimulate the letting-down of milk is almost universal among the nomads . It appears to be essential with yaks , but many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulation . With some females , it is necessary to allow the calf to suckle several times during the milking process to obtain all the milk . Skins of dead calves are sometimes stuffed with straw and used to help stimulate the milk flow of the dam . The Tibetans usually milk with the hands wet . Dry-hand milking apparently has not been practiced in this area . The front legs , and also the rear legs , are usually tied together while yaks and pien niu are being milked . Concentrates are seldom fed to calves . Some whey left from the making of casein or " milk residue " is occasionally fed . Calves learn to eat grass when quite young . During th summer months when  | grass is growing the calves make fair growth , but during other portions of the year , and especially during the late winter and spring months , there is not enough feed to permit normal growth . These periods of near-starvation stunt the young stock and weaken mature animals . Losses are heavy . It is especially difficult for the calves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yak and pier niu packsaddles are of the same design as those used for horses and cattle . Loads are removed at the end of the day or trip , but the saddle is frequently left on for days at a time , apparently owing to a desire to avoid the difficulties of getting animals saddled each morning , but sometimes to protect the animals from storms . Saddle sores occur frequently . Most animals and animal products are used by the people that produce them . Some animals are sold for use in pack caravans but there is no organized marketing procedure . In some areas in the grasslands , markets are held at certain seasons in connection with religious festivals . Milk is used for drinking and for production of butter and milk residue or casein . Some of these products go to the lamaseries and some is stored for winter use . Relatively little is sold . Butter for marketing may be packed in sheep or goat stomachs . Hair is collected as it falls out or when the animals are shorn during the summer . Yields are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no actual data are available . This is used for making tents , felt , ropes , and other things . The coarse hair is used for twine from which tents , grain bags , and similar articles are woven , and the finer under coat is used for felt . Tail hairs are collected and used for the making of dusters . Some yak cows and a considerable number of pien niu cows are kept around the cities in and near the grassland areas for the production Figure  | Figure of market milk . Most of these are small individual enterprises , but a few have been organized on a commercial scale . Milk is also purchased in some areas for the production of casein for glue , largely a wartime development for airplane-lamination work . Some hides are sold for leather , but the tanning and processing of leather is generally poorly done . In Sikong , a considerable portion of the hides are used in the raw state to wrap tea , butter , and salt for transport . The material is wrapped with the wet hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is obtained from each hide , which is a very wasteful procedure . Breeding No data are available on the age of puberty in yaks and pien niu . The yak calf is very small at birth and is estimated to weigh only 8 to 15 kilos . Growth is slow , owing perhaps to both heredity and environmental conditions , and mortality is high . The pien niu calf is somewhat larger than the yak calf , on the average , and growth is  | believed to be somewhat more rapid . Much of the observed slow growth and high mortality in calves may be owing to a common practice of starving calves in order to have milk for the family . No data have been published on estrus or the estrous cycle or on the duration of pregnancy . Huang ( 1943 ) reports that the estrous cycle and the period of pregnancy in the yak and pien niu are similar to those in cattle , or about three weeks and nine months , respectively . Breeding efficiency is apparently low , although no accurate data are available . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not more than 50 percent of the yak females of breeding age produce calves in any one year . There is no organized system of breeding . Bulls usually run with the females of all ages throughout the year , hence neither the time of calving nor the type of mating can be controlled . In addition to the bulls that run with the owners ' herds , there are many herds of " liberated bulls " that roam about at will . These are bulls that have been donated to Buddha and nature , and it is not uncommon to see a herd of 15 or 20 of them roaming about . In the wild state , the time of breeding is reported to be during July and August when the grasses are best , but no accurate data are available . The yak is said to come in estrus about a month earlier than the pien niu . Little selection of breeding stock is practiced . The females in the breeding herd are those that are able to survive the rigorous environment . Selection of a male for breeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the owner 's preference for some color or other trait . The woman of the family frequently makes the selection of a male to be saved for breeding , and there is one herd near Tai Ning , Sikong , in which most of the animals have white faces , owing to the preference of the wife of the owner for white faces and the continuous selection of white-faced animals for breeding . Owing to the lack of a systematic breeding program , the breeding of yaks and pien niu is in a chaotic condition . Pien niu are usually produced by mating yellow bulls to yak females , but offspring from the reciprocal cross are also called pien niu . Hybrids from the two methods of crossing are said to differ in certain characteristics . It is claimed , for example , that hybrids from yellow-cow dams have smaller tails and louder voices than those from yak dams . The latter type are said to have tails more like those of the yak and to have longer hair , more quiet disposition , and greater prolificacy . Whether these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seems probable that much of it is folklore that may not stand up under critical tests . Terminology for describing the various crosses is confused . In some areas the progeny of a cross between the pien niu female and  | either the yak or yellow bull is referred to as a galiba , while the Tibetans refer to these as ah , go hr . In other areas only the progeny resulting from mating yak bulls to pien niu females are referred to as galiba . This latter cross is the one most frequently made . After a few crosses back to either yak or yellow bulls ( three in some areas ) the offspring are referred to as yak or yellow cattle , according to the type with which the hybrids were backcrossed . The pien niu males are reported to be sterile . This belief is so widespread in the grasslands that it is apparently true , even though no clear-cut , experimental evidence is available on this point . Kislovsky ( 1938 ) makes the same claim concerning pien niu in Outer Mongolia . Figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulls is also said to be sterile . No problem of sterility or lowered fertility is reported with the hybrid females or with females resulting from backcrosses to either parent race . Zawadowsky ( 1931 ) gives some information on the conditions of the testes in hybrids between zebu and yak . These are of interest here since cattle and zebus are interfertile and there has been no report of sterility in the male hybrids . His report indicates that hybrids between zebu and yak have normal sexual desires but that the testes produce no spermatozoa . Only Sertoli cells and spermatogonia are present . The yak male has small testes and a smaller , tighter scrotum than the male of the yellow cattle . Male yaks , except those retained for breeding , and all pien niu and other crossbred males are castrated . The pien niu is generally recognized as being superior to yaks and cattle in size , working ability , and milk production , although few clear-cut data are available to support these popular views . Back-  | crosses to either yaks or yellow cattle are generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parent types . Kislovsky ( 1938 ) states that there is some heterosis in the first backcross , but that in Outer Mongolia later generations are considered to be unproductive . The one point that is perfectly clear concerning the breeding of the yak and pien niu is that there is urgent need for careful experimental work to determine the type of cattle bull best adapted to producing pien niu and the best method of utilizing the hybrid females in a continued breeding program .  | Types The sheep of China may be divided into three main types , Mongolian , Tibetan , and Kazakh . There is considerable variation within each type and several subtypes exist , particularly among the Mongolian sheep . There is some overlapping and mixing of types along the borders of the areas occupied by the respective types , especially in southwestern Kansu and eastern Chinghai , where all three types overlap . Mongolian sheep are a fat-tailed type with coarse wool . The tail fat is deposited mainly toward the base end , while the extreme end of the tail is small and is usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is white with a colored head , either black or brown . Piebaldness of various types and self-colored animals are also seen . Kislovsky ( 1938 ) gives the average live weight as about 48 kilos for adult ewes and 56 kilos for rams . The height at withers is reported to vary between 62 and 68 cm . Wool yield is reported to vary from one to three pounds per year . Males are usually horned , and females may be polled or have small horns . There are many variations in the Mongolian sheep . Kislovsky ( 1938 ) states that there are eight subvarieties in Outer Mongolia , apparently having some admixture of blood from fat-rumped sheep . Figure  | Figure All the Mongolian sheep have heavy , fat tails , but two types found in Shensi and Shansi , respectively , have especially large tails . These are the Tung or Tungchow sheep of Shensi and the Hanyang sheep of Shansi . They are very similar in appearance and probably originated from the same basic stock . These animals are of fairly good mutton conformation and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is somewhat pear-shaped , having two lobes . It hangs down on the hocks of the animal and is a hindrance to grazing and in breeding . Tails often weigh as much as 8 to 10 kilos and sometimes more . Fleece yields apparently average around 1 kilo , but yields as high as 2 kilos are reported . The wool is somewhat finer and more crimpy than many other Chinese wools . Both rams and ewes are hornless . Several distinct types are recognized in other portions of China . These include the Shantung , Tan , and Woozie ( Wusih ) . These are all similar to the other Mongolian sheep and vary only in certain respects . The Shantung sheep have somewhat larger bodies and the fleece is said to be somewhat finer . They are found in Shantung and the adjacent provinces of Honan , Hopeh , and Shansi . The Tan sheep has somewhat finer wool that is said to be of more uniform fineness.  | Figure It is found in Ningsia . The pelts are valued for making linings for coats . Woozie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Kiangsu , and Chekiang . The body is larger than that of other Mongolian sheep and the fleece is white and of somewhat better quality than that of Mongolian sheep but not so fine as that from Shantung . The fleeces from these sheep yield about 70 percent clean wool . Before the war the best quality wool was obtained from Shantung according to Hsu ( 1943 ) . The spring clip was about four inches and the fall clip about three inches in length . Fleeces weighed from two to three catties . Two other local types of Mongolian sheep , called Taiku and Shouyang , are recognized in Shansi and it is probable that local subtypes exist in other provinces .  | Figure Tibetan sheep , as the name implies , are found primarily on the Tibetan plateau and adjacent regions . Color markings are similar to the Mongolian sheep , and the head and sometimes other portions of the body may be either black or brown . Both males and females are usually horned and there is considerable variation in size and shape of horns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but is somewhat coarser on the average and the fleeces are somewhat lighter . The most distinct difference between Mongolian and Tibetan sheep is in the form of the tail . The Mongolian has a fat tail , while the tail of the Tibetan is naturally small and not fat . It is about 10 to 12 cm. long and is straight and conical in shape . There is consider-  | able variation in size and form , but there is not sufficient knowledge of these sheep available to justify classification into subtypes at the present time . Kazakh sheep are apparently native to Kazakhstan and adjacent areas , from whence they have spread into Sinkiang and adjoining regions of China . These sheep are taller and larger-framed than most of the Mongolian and Tibetan sheep . Color patterns are similar , and the head and other parts of the body may be either black or brown . Males are usually horned and females usually hornless . The Figure tail is large , two lobed , and rather square at the end . It resembles the tail of the Karakul and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are of slightly better mutton conformation than the Mongolian and Tibetan sheep . Some studies have been made of Chinese and other Asiatic wools and the results of these are summarized below to give an indication of the type and quality of wool produced . Munz ( 1937 ) analyzed several wool samples that originated in northeastern Asia . Four samples of Mongolian wool showed an average of 82.3 percent wool and 17.7 percent hair and kemp . Three samples of Tibetan wool averaged 81.3 percent wool and 18.7 percent hair and kemp . Four samples of Kansu wool , which were similar to the Tibetan  | Figure wool , averaged 82.8 percent wool and 17.2 percent hair and kemp . Two samples from Shensi and Shansi averaged 85.5 percent wool and 14.5 percent hair and kemp . The under wool of both Mongolian and Tibetan types was estimated to have spinning counts of 60 to 70 . Saito ( 1936 ) reports that the Mongolian fleeces studied consisted of 22.2 percent coarse wool , including kemp , 8.6 percent semi-coarse type , and 69.2 percent fine type . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and 25.5 microns . Burns , Johnston , and Chen ( 1940 ) studied a number of samples of Chinese wool and also some other Asiatic wools and wool from the Romney Marsh for comparison . The following types were included in these studies : 1 . True Sining wool ? a type of Tibetan wool considered to be best of all Chinese carpet wools but rarely obtainable in pure type . 2 . Mixed Sining wool ? a mixture of true Sining and Kansu wool . 3 . Lanchow wool ? from Kansu province and often blended with Tibetan wool . 4 . Szechwan wool ? from Szechwan province and classed with Tibetan wool . 5 . Woozie wool ? from the neighborhood of Shanghai . Short in staple and suitable for filling wools in carpet-making . Classed among the poorer carpet wools. 6 . Vicanere wool ? produced in north central India . Very lively and lofty and one of the finest carpet wools. 7 . Aleppo wool ? grown in Syria and Asia Minor . Has good length , color , strength , and resiliency and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romney wool ? similar to carpet wools but more uniform and lacking the hair and kemp common to carpet wools.  | A summary of certain of the data on these wools is given below : Table Ross ( 1936 ) states that the wool of sheep from north Hsingan ( Barga region ) of Manchuria is very coarse , contains much kemp and hair , and is purely a carpet wool . Wool from South Manchuria ( Chinchow and Chaoyang ) is described as being finer and containing less kemp . Wool from Hata in central Jehol is described as being intermediate to these two types . The whole fleece of Inner Mongolian sheep is described as having a soft under coat of fine wool and a very coarse outer coat containing much kemp . Ross states that the only wool exported for clothing purposes is obtained by manually combing the living sheep in the late spring when , owing to the fact that the short under coat is shed earlier than the outer coat , a great deal of the under coat may be removed , mixed with only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of kemp . This wool , classified in the trade as " Sikow ball wool no. 1 " , was exported to Germany to the extent of 800,000 pounds per year for the manufacture of blankets and coarse tweeds . This type of wool came from southern  | Figure Inner Mongolia , owing to the proximity of Chinese agricultural areas which insured a plentiful supply of labor for hand-combing , which would not he undertaken by Mongols in purely pastoral pursuits . Ross ( 1936 ) mentions that the only other wool produced in Eastern Asia and exported for clothing purposes is the Shantung lamb 's wool . This is shorn from lambs at 3 to 4 months and in diameter is equivalent to Merino wool of about 64 spinning count . It is described as uniform and of high spinning value . The wool contains very little kemp or hair at this age but rapidly coarsens in older sheep . Management and Feeding Several systems of handling sheep are practiced in China . In the grasslands the animals are grazed throughout the year . During the summer they graze at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid heat and flies . During the autumn , early winter , and spring they are kept on the lower hillsides and higher valleys . During the severe winter weather the sheep are kept in the lower valleys , and at this season some shelter may be provided to protect them from storms . In many areas the sheep may be run in herds along with cattle and horses , one person ( usually older men or women , or children ) watching the entire group . A sling shot , or other device for throwing stones or soil , is sometimes used as an aid in guiding and controlling the flock . Flocks belonging to lamaseries or to villagers are usually brought inside the walls of the lamasery or village at night , when grazing in the vicinity . In the farming areas the number of sheep per farm is smaller than the number maintained by nomad families . This number is fre-  | quently as small as 1 or 2 in the rice regions and may be as high as 20 to 40 , according to Buck ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area the number is higher and some farms keep as many as 100 , although most flocks are smaller than this . These animals are grazed on the uncultivated areas on the hillsides and then returned to the farmer 's quarters at night . They are also grazed on any uncultivated land on the farm and in the fields after harvest . Overgrazing of the hillsides in such areas is very common . During the winter , straw is fed and other roughage produced on the farm , such as sweetpotato vines , bean vines , etc . Herding practices vary in the farming areas . In some cases , a child or an old person in the family takes care of the flock . In others , a system of community grazing is practiced . The usual practice is to hire a shepherd to care for all the sheep in a village or belonging to a group of farmers , and he is paid according to the number of animals each has . He cares for them during the day but in the evening each farmer gets his animals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the owners . Where they do not have a system of community grazing , farmers or villagers who own only one or two sheep may tether them for grazing or have a child lead them while grazing during the day . In the area around Tai Lake , west of Shanghai , the common practice is to keep sheep confined throughout the year . This is a silk-producing area and the primary feed is surplus mulberry leaves . The sheep in turn provide meat and wool , and manure for the mulberry trees . Shearing practices vary in different areas . In Tibet and adjacent areas shearing is usually done once a year , about May , June , and July . Figure  | Figure In other areas where there is a demand for short wool for use in carpet manufactures , such as in Ningsia , or where the economic pressure makes it necessary to have cash income at more than one season , sheep are frequently shorn twice yearly , in the spring and again in the autumn . Occasionally , they may be shorn as many as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas of Inner Mongolia , the fine under coat is combed out with a coarse comb in the spring and shearing is done in July , the clip then consisting mainly of outer coat . Shearing is done with hand shears which are of very poor quality , so that the clip is uneven and the work laborious . Shearers usually do 10 to 15 animals a day . There are reports of men doing as many as 100 per day , but such a number seems highly improbable with the poor equipment that is generally available . In Tibetan regions the shearer usually gets every tenth fleece as pay for the shearing work . The legs of the sheep are usually tied together for shearing . Shears  | vary in type . Some have a spring-type hinge while others have a bolt pivot hinge , and a few are still in use that are in two parts with the hinge provided by the shearer 's hand . Providing of good-type shears , made of high quality steel , would be a big contribution to the sheepraisers and also the users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of more uniform length . Often , in the Tibetan area , the loose wool is hand-pulled before shearing is done . Women and children are on the alert , during the spring season , to pick up wool that has been shed . Docking is seldom practiced . In the Tibetan sheep it is hardly necessary , owing to the small size of the tail . In the other types which have fat tails , it is rather difficult but might not be entirely impractical if done at an early age . Research is needed on this point . Ross ( 1936 ) describes in some detail the feeding and other environmental conditions for sheep in Manchuria and adjacent regions . Only a few points from his discussion will be mentioned here . He points out that in Manchuria ( except in the extreme south ) and on the Mongolian plateau , little growth of plants occurs before the end of April and after August , with the result that for six or seven months ( eight in the case of Hailar ) sheep are required to subsist on dried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large part of the Barga plain and on the Mongolian plateau by the complete lack of cover on the bare and treeless prairie . Ross also states that normally little snow falls in this region owing to the extreme dryness during the winter months , and native sheep are able by scratching to reach the dry grass underneath the snow . If , however , a snowfall is unusually heavy , even of only a few extra inches , then high mortality may result , as during 1933 ? 34 when the wool from the Barga region decreased by 25 percent , largely owing to mortality from starvation . In another area , . Darahan in South Hsingan , Ross cites the great difficulty under existing conditions for growing improved sheep , there being no growth of grass from October to May and no winter-growing legumes . Heavy rain in June and July is reported to cause rank growth of coarse reedlike grass which is of little use for grazing or haymaking . It is also stated that the sheep in this area must be housed at night for protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutton almost entirely in and near the areas where they are produced , since there are no facilities for moving animals for long distances for utilization of the meat in other areas . Herds for slaughter move on foot from grassland areas to such cities as Peking and Tientsin that are within driving distance . Therefore , the use of mutton as a staple article of diet is limited to the grasslands , cities in and near the grasslands , and to farming areas where a con-  | Figure siderable number of sheep are raised . Many animals are slaughtered and utilized by the producers . When sold in villages and cities , the carcasses are hung up in the small open-air markets and pieces cut off when a purchaser arrives . In the northwest it is common practice to cut the fat in several places , either by a cross or by a series of parallel cuts , to expose the lean so the customer can see it . This is the opposite of practices in other countries , where the fat cover is preserved as carefully as possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was well fattened . Pelts and skins are used for several purposes . The pelts , particularly of lambs and of younger sheep , are valued for use in lining gowns for winter wear . Skins are used for leather for various purposes , and  | Figure  | a great number are used in sheepskin rafts . Skins for this latter purpose are soaked in water for a few days , and then the wool is pulled out . Linseed oil is then placed inside , shaken around . and allowed to soak in thoroughly . The skins for this purpose are removed carefully so that the leg , neck , and rear openings are as small as possible . After the soaking with linseed oil , these openings are carefully sewed up , and the skin is inflated with air . The inflated skins are fastened to light wooden frames and used as rafts in river transport . The small rafts have 10 to 13 skins and usually 12 or 13 . After a trip downstream , the operator picks the raft up and walks back upstream for the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loads . For long trips down the river , as many as 300 skins are made up into a single raft . Figure The Wool Trade Wool is the chief commercial commodity resulting from sheep production in China . It is of very poor quality from the standpoint of clothing manufacture and has been utilized to a large extent in world trade as carpet wool . A considerable amount is also utilized by natives in the grassland-producing areas and areas nearby for spinning , felting , and weaving into rugs , felt mats , and to some extent for clothing . During the present war a considerable amount is being used in commercial textile factories . Some wool is transported to market by truck , but most of the transporting is still done by pack animals and by rafts and other river  | craft . Carts are also used in some areas . Shearing equipment and methods are poor , so the wool is generally in poor condition when it is ready to be sent to market . It is usually made up into bundles , weighing 80 to 140 catties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wool . The identity of individual fleeces is completely lost . Adulteration of wool with dirt and other materials , either by the producer or by intermediate purchasing agents , is very common . Because of these practices and lack of proper precautions to keep the wool dry , it usually reaches the central marketing points in extremely poor condition . At these central marketing points the wool is cleaned up by dusting and sorting out the dirt . It may then be sorted into two or three grades , largely on the basis of relative fineness , color , et cetera . No well-organized methods of grading or sorting have been developed . Wool is handled as a government monopoly in some provinces , and the wool of the northwest is to a considerable extent being handled as a central government monopoly , through a government-buying agency in Lanchow which buys from the producer and resells to the manufacturer or for export . There is much room for improvement in the method of handling wool since there is at present much wastage and inefficiency . Some of the wool is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done in Lanchow by an establishment that is operated jointly by the central government and a commercial textile concern . The amounts of wool exported from China in various years are shown in the table below . Goat 's hair and wool are also included in this table for convenience . Table The figures for the percentage of total exports that consist of wool , in terms of monetary value , indicate that wool does not make a large contribution to the total . However , this income is very important to a section of the population which depends largely on livestock for its existence .  | The countries to which most of the wool has been exported in recent years are indicated below , in percents of the total wool going to each : Table The relative importance of various exporting points is indicated by the following figures , which show the percentage of the wool that was exported from various cities in recent years : Table Exports have naturally decreased owing to wartime conditions , and this is especially true of exports from seaports . During the present war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for wool . Some wool from Tibet goes on pack animals into India . Much of the wool exported now goes to the Soviet Union , and the estimated amounts exported to that country in 1938 and 1939 were 17,000 and 530,000 piculs , l respectively . A considerable amount is imported into China . The amount in 1937 was 16,110,465 pounds . Of this , 11,573,354 pounds were from England , largely in the form of wool top . Other imports included 1,178,212 pounds of yarn and 70,850 square yards or 2,376,567 pounds of woolen piece goods . Much of the wool manufacturing in China at present is hand work ; either for home use for clothing or for local sale . There is also some rug making in some areas , especially Ningsia , Kansu , Sikong. and Chinghai . The manufacture of felt , mostly by individual or small manufacturing units , is also important in these and other areas . A few large plants are operating in and near larger cities for the production of various types of woolen cloth . Industrial cooperatives are doing some wool-manufacturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present war there was a marked increase in woolen manufacturing in China and this will undoubtedly be resumed when Footnote  | peace comes . Ross ( 1936 ) states , for example . that 2,000,000 pounds of native wool were being used for clothing purposes in Mukden . It was being used to make cheap blankets for the local Chinese demand and being mixed with a small portion of imported wool for army blankets . Uniforms for the Manchu army and police were being made with a warp of native wool and a weft of imported wool . The growth of woolen mills in various Chinese cities is also cited . Prior to 1931 Chinese imports consisted very largely of manufactured goods with only a small amount of tops and an even smaller quantity of grease wool . In 1934 and 1935 there were marked increases in the volume of tops imported and a sharp decrease in the imports of woolen goods , especially yarns . Ross points out that most of the tops used are of the coarser type ( 48 spinning count ) , coarser yarns being used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chinese lower classes for the knitting of mufflers and caps , while a limited amount of higher-quality tops was being utilized for production of worsted materials , gabardine and serges , etc. , for the higherclass Chinese demand . Ross states that there is widespread opinion that there is a definite transition in China from the use of cotton and silk to the use of wool . Price is indicated to be one of the main limiting factors in this transition , and ignorance of the value and use of wool among the illiterate population is a second limiting factor . Breeding Almost no data are available on the basic reproductive phenomena of the age of puberty , length of estrus and estrous cycle , and duration of pregnancy . In the range-sheep areas , the ewes apparently begin coming in estrus about the first of August , and most of them are bred during August , September , and October . This results in lambings in winter and early spring when the weather conditions are unfavorable to survival and feed conditions are not satisfactory for a good flow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to control the breeding season , the rams being allowed to run with the ewes during the entire year . It is reported that a birch-bark apron is used in some sections of Sikong in an attempt to delay breeding . It is reported that most of the ewes in Yunnan are bred during the summer , so that lambs are born in the fall and early winter . Losses are said to be heavy owing to this lambing at an unfavorable season . Work is needed to determine the length of the breeding season in the various grassland areas of China , as a basis for determining if breeding can be delayed and yet get a satisfactory lamb crop . Owing to poor feed supply during late winter and early spring it is possible that ewes may be in too poor condition to carry and nurse lambs , if bred in late fall or early winter . Lnvestigations are needed on this point .  | Observations have been made during 1942 and 1943 by Hsu and Peng ( 1943 ) which shed some light on this problem . A group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work and most of them were already bred . Of the 16 that were not bred , 7 were settled in July , 2 in August , 3 in September , 5 in October , and 1 in December of 1942 . In 1943 , breeding was started during the latter part of June . Six ewes were bred in June , 34 in July , 21 in August , 5 in September , and 3 during the early part of October . Breeding was not yet completed at the time of preparation of this report . However , these data indicate that the Tibetan sheep tend to have a prolonged breeding season , and if they follow the pattern of other types of sheep , it should be possible to postpone breeding until the early winter months so that lambs would be born after the weather warms up and the grass begins to grow in the spring . Duration of pregnancy of the 16 ewes mentioned in the preceding paragraph as being bred in 1942 averaged 152.6 clays and ranged from 148 to 159 days . Birth weight of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farming areas from that in the grasslands . In Shansi , for example , ewes usually begin to come into heat at about the time summer rains bring out a growth of fresh grass , ordinarily in the first half of July . A few ewes come into heat in June . Shepherds prefer to breed as early in the season as possible . Ewes remain in fairly good condition through January or February . Subsequently , because the pasture is extremely scanty they are in condition neither to nurture a foetus or suckle a lamb . Lambs born in March or later are often stunted at birth and develop poorly afterward . Temperature conditions are less favorable for survival of the lamb when born in the middle of winter , but provision is made to take care of that in areas of settled agriculture like Shansi or Suiyuan . During lambing season shepherds are on hand night and day to care for ewe and lamb . Following birth , both ewe and lamb are kept in the farm enclosure for several days . After the ewe is returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under shelter until growth and advancing spring allow greater exposure . Therefore , loss of lambs from exposure in these areas is not high . The long coat of wool carried by lambs at birth may increase their ability to stand cold . Li Suiyuan , shepherds often collect lambs born on the range and place them in pockets of heavy felt bags , in which they are carried back to shelter . Sheep in Shantung are reported to be prolific , producing many twins , but definite data are lacking and , in general , twinning is rare among Mongolian sheep . Lamb-crop figures are not available for the grassland areas , but some estimates place the crop at 50 to 60 percent born . Death losses are usually heavy , the extent of these losses depending upon weather and feed conditions , and estimates obtained of the losses are sometimes as high as 50 to 90 percent . The liver fluke , which is  | present in many grassland areas and especially the damper regions of the Tibetan country , takes a heavy toll of lambs . Most males @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be cut with either scissors or knife , the testes squeezed out , and the cord severed by cutting , by pulling with hands or teeth , or by biting it . In some sections a string may be tied around the base of the scrotum in young lambs . The practice of crushing the spermatic cord by beating between two stones is also reported . The proportion of males left intact varies in different areas . In the grasslands of the northwest the common practice is to leave 1 intact male for every 10 females . Where large herds are maintained the wethers are usually kept in one herd and the ewes and rams in another . In Sikong there are usually 5 rams per 100 ewes , but the smaller flocks usually have a higher proportion of rams . Chang ( 1943 ) made a comparison of the fleeces of 18 Tibetan ( classified as valley type ) sheep and 4 animals from Tibetan ewes and sired by a Rambouillet ram . These data are summarized below : Table The individual fiber data represent averages of 300 fibers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each animal . Kislovsky ( 1938 ) states that 1,300 Merino rams had been brought into Outer Mongolia ( apparently from the Soviet Union ) for use in grading up the native sheep but no details are given of the results obtained .  | A considerable number of Rambouillets have been brought into Sinkiang from the Soviet Union , but no detailed data are available on results obtained from their use in grading up . An indication of the result obtained is given in figure 59 . Data on the results of grading up Mongolian sheep with Merinos 2 in Manchuria , as measured by fleece yields and reviewed by Wang ( 1942 ) , are listed below : Table The exact breeding of the " Improved Mongolian X Merino " is not clear . It is stated in this same report that the South Manchuria Railway Company began work with Merino and Corriedales in 1934 , but no results are given . Ross ( 1936 ) visited Manchuria and adjacent areas in 1936 and observed the results of several attempts to use improved breeds for grading up of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below . A considerable amount of work has been done at the Kunchuling station , maintained by the South Manchuria Railway Company , near Hsinking in Kirin Province . This station is not in a pastoral area so the results can not be taken to indicate performance of improved sheep in the native sheep-raising areas . First-generation sheep from the use of Rambouillet rams showed a considerable increase in wool production , but the wool still had much of the character of the native wool , being fluffy and lacking density while still being mixed with a considerable portion of the coarse fibers of native sheep . The amount of wool is about double that of the native or about four to five pounds . The second-generation sheep ( % Rambouillet ) approached Merino wool type , but the staple was somewhat longer and density was less , and there was little wool on the neck , legs , and belly . There was little evidence of native-type wool fibers or hair . These sheep were housed and well bedded and were fed what is described as a generous ration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested undernutrition . Corriedales and first-generation grades of Corriedale and Footnote  | Mongolian sheep at this station were described as small and undersized , and as having wool that lacked density and character . Work conducted at the Darahan station in South Hsingan gave a better indication of the ability of improved types to survive under native conditions , since this station was located in the border country between farming and pastoral regions . First , second , and inbred cross Merino-Mongolian sheep were all available at this station . They were housed at night for protection against wolves and bandits but otherwise were handled under natural grazing conditions as far as possible . Purebred Merinos appeared to show the effects of the severe winter and unsuitable pasture conditions in the summer . The staple was very short and rather oily and contained much dirt , yielding only 30 percent after scouring . The sheep were in poor condition and rams yielded only 8 to 9 pounds , rarely 10 pounds , and ewes 6 to 7 pounds . Firstand second-cross and inbred second-cross sheep showed the expected increase in wool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 70 percent in the native to 60 and 40 in the first and second crosses . First-cross animals appeared to be in better condition than the Merinos or the second-cross animals . All the improved animals were fed a staple ration of soybean straw , supplemented with some lucerne hay and grain ( principally kaoliang ) during the winter months . The director of the station stated that he did not believe crossbred sheep could survive under natural conditions during the winter , owing to less resistance than the native sheep and relatively little aptitude for scratching through the snow to find feed . A considerable number of Merinos were imported into Shansi Province by the Governor , Yen Shi Shan , about 1919 or soon thereafter . Ross ( 1936 ) states that these were kept under controlled conditions , being hand-fed and housed , and increased up to about 2,000 in number . ' When an attempt was made to run them under natural conditions , with only some feeding of hay in the winter when snow was heavy , the flock deteriorated rapidly and numbers declined owing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( grading up ) in the hope of increasing the hardiness of the sheep are said to have failed , there being little increase in their resistance to adverse factors , while the wool was of low value and very coarse and hairy . The work in Shansi was apparently done with no adequate technical supervision , hence it is difficult to evaluate the results . Ross inspected a small flock in the Saratsie District of Suiyuan which originated from these Shansi Merinos . One ram and 10 ewes had been run with some native ewes for three years . This area is about 2,000 feet lower than the Mongolian plateau and considerably warmer . They had apparently thrived in this region but when moved to the plateau death losses  | were heavy . At the time of inspection , only one of the ewes that originally came from Shansi remained . This and others of the pure or grade Merino type had wool only 11/4 to 1 ? inches in length , although this represented six months ' growth during the summer months . All wool of the Merino types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inadequate nutrition . The grade sheep had a marked admixture of coarse Mongolian-type wool with much kemp and heterotypic fiber . The three-quarter Merino sheep were reported to shear 6 to 7-pounds as compared with 2 to 21/2 pounds on the native sheep , which were valued at about 50 and 20 cents per pound , respectively . Experiments in crossbreeding between the Rambouillet and certain of the types of sheep native to North China were conducted over a period of nine years by Moyer and Tong ( 1944 ) at Minghsien College in Taiku , Shansi , to investigate the possibilities of producing finer grades of wool in China by that method . As part of the project , specific attention was also given to a study of the local types themselves . The plan of the experiments and the available results are summarized below . Four native types were selected , to which the designations Taiku , Shouyang , Hanyang , and Luau were given . The regions where these types are found , as far as known , and certain of their distinguishing characteristics are described below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shansi , as well as in Hopei , Shensi , and possibly other provinces . It resembles closely the type found in Inner Mongolia , from which it may not differ significantly . In contrast with that type , faces are usually white and the animals appear to be somewhat smaller in size . Its fat tail is relatively small and its wool covering contains a finer under coat and a coarser outer coat . The Shouyang type is found as a distinct type in Shouyang district , Shansi , and to a lesser extent in surrounding districts where it often occurs mixed with the Taiku . It differs from the Taiku in having a heavier tail and shorter legs , in being somewhat lighter in weight , and in having a heavier fleece which is somewhat wavy and lustrous . Its wool is recognized as a distinct class on the Tientsin market . The Hanyang type is found in western Honau , particularly in the vicinity , of Hanyang city . A similar animal . found eastward in Shantung , is believed to be of the same type . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publication seems to be similar . It is characterized by an unusually heavy fat tail apd by a finer wool which also is somewhat crimpy . Its wool is relatively uniform in character , without a distinct inner and outer  | coat . On the Tientsin market this wool is considered as the finest of the Chinese wools . Unlike the Taiku and the Shouyang , twinning is fairly common in this type . The Luan is a name given to a type after the former name of a city in southeast Shansi ( now called Changchih ) around which the type is commonly found . It is distinguished by its tail , which is long like most western breeds but is enlarged around the base , resembling the Figure  | Figure tail of first-generation Rambouillet-Taiku crossbreds . In size and in the characteristics of its wool it resembles the Hanyang type . The Rambouillets used were mostly of a smooth-bodied type , obtained from the Deer Lodge Farms Company , Montana , although some lightly wrinkled rams , imported from Wyoming and Montana by the Chinese Government , were also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their offspring were utilized in a study of the behavior of this stock under local conditions . The first experiments , begun in 1932 , included only two breeds , the Taiku and the Shouyang . Between 30 and 40 ewes of each of these types were successfully bred , approximately one half being with rams of the Rambouillet and one half with rams of the appropriate native type . Later , with help from the National Economic Council of the Chinese Government and from the Rockefeller Foundation , the experiment was very much enlarged . Two additional types were introduced , the Hanyang and the Luan , and the number of ewes of each type in the experiment was increased to about 120 . A part of this increase in program was accomplished in 1936 and the rest was completed in 1937 . The Japanese invasion , however , completely ruined the work of that year , and many sheep were lost . A portion of the program was reestablished in 1938 and continued into 1941 . Crossbreeding , in the main part of the program , was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which produced half-blood and three-quarter-blood Rambouillet animals . It was considered that little additional information of value would be gained by going further . During the last several years of the experiment , however , a large number of Rambouillet-Taiku half-bloods  | were backcrossed to the Taiku in order to bring out the inheritance of certain genetic factors and in order to investigate the beginning steps in one plan which might be followed in fixing a new improved type . Experimental animals of all types were raised during any given season under approximately the same environmental conditions . Figure These were a little better than the conditions under which local animals are commonly raised . but not very much better . Breeding-stock gained the main part of their sustenance the year round by grazing in the surrounding country . A certain amount of supplementary feedstuffs was given during the poorest months for grazing , usually be-  | tween January and April , consisting of materials available , such as leaves , sweet-potato vines , buckwheat straw , bean straw , and bean pods . No concentrates were fed , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but which otherwise received favored treatment . All animals were quartered in the open except during the coldest months , when they were placed at night in simple unfloored sheds . Pens and yards were swept daily , thus reducing to some extent the danger from parasites . The breeding season , following local practice , began in July and usually ended in October , and the lambing season began in December . Lambs were given careful attention at birth , and following birth they were kept in pens and yards until about April when they were pastured during the daytime . Upon weaning they were fed mainly with carrot tops , the preferred food for lambs in that region . No concentrates were fed . Weights and measurements of all offspring were taken at birth and at intervals of one month thereafter until reaching an age of 6 months . Similar records were taken subsequently at 9 , 12 , and 18 months and afterwards twice a year , following the spring and fall shearings . Measurements included length of legs , height at the shoulders , body circumference , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others . Weights and similar measurements were taken of the breeding-stock twice yearly , after the spring and fall shearings . Local animals were sheared according to local practice . For the Taiku and Shouyang types , this consisted of pulling out the finer under coat with a coarse , claw-like comb , in the spring . In the latter part of July or early August the animals were clipped , removing the coarse outer coat and whatever else remained or may have grown . The Hanyang and the Luan types and all crossbreds were sheared once annually , in the spring . Records kept with respect to wool included weight after shearing and the scoured weight of a representative sample . For scouring , one-pound samples were picked out of different parts of the sheared or pulled wool spread out on a table . Samples were washed several times , first with soda , and then thoroughly rinsed . A special laboratory was set up for this purpose , which included washing apparatus and a drying oven . For future reference and detailed study , shoulder samples were taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , records of these kinds were obtained from some 400 to 600 animals of native types . and from several hundred crossbred types . Triplicate copies of these data were prepared and left in different places for safekeeping . It is hoped that at least one set will be found intact after the war is over , when the data will be summarized and analyzed . A detailed statement of the findings of these investigations can be made only after this analysis has been completed . Information is  | sufficiently complete , however , to state in a general way some of the results obtained . With respect to body weight , first-generation crossbreds of Rambouillets with the Taiku and Shouyang types were appreciably heavier than the native animals . With respect to meat , a local prejudice existed against the flavor of the Merino breed , from experience gained with animals introduced by Governor Yen Hsi-shan . A difference in flavor could usually be detected also in meat of the Rambouillet crossbreds , in comparison with meat of native animals , but objection to it was not strong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds . That of the first-generation cross with Rambouillets was about 5 pounds . The three-quarter bloods averaged approximately 8 pounds , and individual animals went up to as high as 10 pounds . The quality of wool also was better . The fleeces of the half-bloods carried a certain amount of a coarser outer coat , but this type of fiber was relatively inconspicuous in the ewes , although more prominent in the rams . Fleeces of the three-quarter-bloods contained no coarse outer coat , and the wool throughout was finer and contained more yolk . Shouyang native animals produced 3 pounds of wool per animal , and the crossbreds were similar to those of the Taiku except that the wool , in general , seemed a little coarser . The following table shows data available for the year 1935 , from experimental offspring which then were 18 months or older . It should be mentioned that wool yields for all types of animals that year were , in general , lower than the average . Table With respect to hardiness it was soon demonstrated that the Rambouillet breed was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions . Stomach worms killed all the Iambs born the first year , but this pest was fully controlled in subsequent years by drenching with copper sulphate . Half-bloods seemed only slightly less resistant than native animals to this and other adverse factors in the environment , but three-quarter-bloods were definitely less hardy . This was shown in a greater proportion of deaths before reaching maturity and in a less healthy appearance of those that survived . Experience in these studies suggests that no animal less  | hardy than the half-bloods would be raised successfully in that region unless the present environmental conditions were appreciably improved . Available information is as yet insufficient to report on results obtained with the Hanyang and Lunn types . An attempt was made to study the inheritance of the tail characteristics . Length appeared without exception to be dominant . All first-generation crossbreds had a long tail , resembling the Rambouillet , although the comparative number of vertebrae was not determined . The curl sometimes found at the end of a fat tail seems to be inherited as a separate character , possibly as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slight twist at the bottom , while others were without it . Fattiness appears to be governed by multiple factors . First-generation crossbreds had a partial fattiness , which expressed itself as an enlargement around the base . In the case of the Rambouillet-Hanyang half-bloods , the amount of fat was quite considerable . Three-quarter Ramhouillet. - one- quarter Taiku animals had little or no enlargement of the tail . Figure // Figure  | Types The goats of China are quite variable in size , type of coat , and color . No distinct types are recognized over large areas , but there are groups in many localities that appear rather distinct . Colors that are commonly seen are solid black , tan with a dark stripe down the back and some white on the face and underline ( somewhat like the Toggenburg pattern ) ; white ; gray or blue ( white and black fibers mixed ) ; black and white ( black may be on front and rear portions ) ; and dark fawn or brown with a dark stripe down the back . Kislovsky ( 1938 ) reports that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion being 66.8 percent . Both polled and horned animals are found , and there is much variation in size and shape of horns . There is also wide variation in the length of hair . Many animals have short , smooth coats while others have quite long , heavy coats of hair , and there are all gradations in between . The " Mah " goat is a rather distinct type found in the vicinity of Chengtu , Szechwan . Color ranges from light to deep brown . A dark brown or black stripe extends down the face , with lighter brown on either side , and a dark brown stripe extends along the back from horns to tail . Darker hairs are found along the midlines of the fronts of the legs . Both males and females are horned . A few polled animals are found . In males the horns are short and thick , the tips pointing outward and downward , while in the female they are more slender and point upward and backward . Ears are straight and point upward and forward . The back is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legs are relatively short . Hoofs are usually black . Hair is short over most of the body , but in some animals it may be rather long on the upper portions of the legs and along the sides of the abdomen . Two types of udders are found in the " Mali " goat . A cylindrical type , with large teats which point downward and forward , is found in the larger-type animals , while smaller animals tend to have spher-  | ical udders with small teats that point somewhat to the side . Fortynine adult females were measured by Tang ( 1943 ) and these data are summarized below : Table Six adult males were also weighed , which ranged from 76 to 101 catties and averaged 84.8 . In disposition , the " Mah " goats are active and rather bad-tempered . They are good grazers . The lactation period averages about 5 months but may be as long as 10 months . Data obtained on milk samples from 23 does , apparently at varying times in lactation , showed the following averages : specific gravity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 3.38 percent ; milk protein , 5.13 percent . Data on 20 does showed average production to be 267.7 c.c. per day , with 466.7 c.c. as the highest observed value . These goats are used chiefly as a source of meat and the hides are used for leather . Most of the hides were exported prior to the war . Since the farmers usually do not milk their does , little has been done to improve milk production in the native animals . A small black or very dark-brown type with long hair is found in Shensi and Shansi . It is said to produce up to three pounds of milk per day at the height of lactation . The extent of the area in which it is found and the variations in size and other characteristics in this type are not known . In Yunnan a type of black goat is said to exist which is horned , muscular , fattens reasonably well , and has an adult weight of 60 to 70 catties ( 30 to 35 kilos ) . It is reported to produce about 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gorosenko ( 1936 ) states that all goats throughout Mongolia belong to one primitive type . The color is variable , but 66.8 percent are gray . The live weight is 30 to 41 kilograms , and the height at withers is 59 to 63 cm . The majority , 73.4 percent , are horned . Gorosenko believes that all goats of Central Asia ( Kirghizstan , Kazakhstan , Tadjikistan , and Mongolia ) are of a common type . He states that goats in Mongolia are used for milk , meat , and skins . Other local areas no doubt have predominant types but there is not sufficient information available to indicate either the types or the distribution in many areas . In many sections there is a multiplicity of types . In Chinghai , for example , a great variety of colors are seen // Figure  | and hair is short , long , and many variations in between . This is true in many other areas . Some of the small , long-haired goats observed Figure  | in Chinghai are quite similar to the Kangra goat found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern India . According to Kislovsky ( 1938 ) , the goats in Outer Mongolia range from 59 to 63 cm. in height at the withers and from 30 to 41 kilos in weight . They are described as a primitive type . He states that earless animals are occasionally seen . Management and Feeding The goat is kept primarily for meat . In some areas , especially in the northern portions of the country , they are used for milk production for family use . A limited number of commercial dairies and areas in which the goat is used by individuals for producing market milk have been developed . Before the present war a number of goat herds had been assembled around cities in North China . Most of these were in or near areas where purebred herds were available , and most of the animals in the commercial herds were grades from crossing purebreds and natives . Skins are an important by-product , and the hair is also collected from longer-haired animals . The methods of managing goats are similar to those described for sheep . In the grassland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the farming areas the same situation exists . The goats are run in community flocks either separately or along with the sheep . or they may be taken care of by the individual owner , either by having some member of the family herd them during the day or by tethering them on grassy areas . Shelter may be provided in the owner 's home or in adjacent quarters , or goats may simply be tethered near the house at night . In southern Szechwan and certain other areas , some farmers allow their goats to graze only in the afternoon , owing to an unfounded belief that the dew on the grass will inflame the lips and cause diarrhea . Few data are available on carcass yields in goats . Seven " Mali " goats slaughtered in Chengtu yielded the data , collected by Hsu ( 1943 ) , which are summarized below . These included three wethers and four females , averaging 33A years in estimated age . Table The feeds for goats are essentially the same as those for sheep . In the grasslands goats are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplemental feed for the severe winter months . In farming areas  | they are allowed to graze along the hillsides , between fields , and any other places where grasses are available . During the winter months when grass is short , supplemental roughages , such as rice straw , other cereal straws in areas where rice is not grown , soybean straw , tree leaves , dried vines of sweet potatoes , dried pepper leaves and stems , etc. , are fed . Grain is seldom fed , but in Yunnan it is reported that farmers give some grains such as rice bran , beans , and oats to their animals . The use of corn for fattening goats is also reported in this area . In areas where goats are used for production of market milk , the feeding of grain is more commonly practiced . In and around Chengtu , for example , the materials commonly used for supplemental feeding are corn , soybeans , soybean dregs from making soybean milk , and bran . Bonemeal is also used to some extent as a mineral supplement . Iodine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nubian goats at Chengtu . This deficiency resulted in a hairless or a nearly hairless condition at birth , stillbirth , or death very shortly after birth . Thyroid glands of the kids were much enlarged , and hyperplasia of the secretory cells was found . The addition of potassium iodide to the diet has corrected the deficiency , so that no more cases have been observed . Native animals in that area appear to be less susceptible to the deficiency , but this may be a cause of lowered reproductive efficiency in this and other areas where goiter is commonly seen . Goats are slaughtered and sold for meat in the vicinities where they are produced . In the farming areas of China , goats are numerous and more popular for meat than are sheep . More are slaughtered during the winter than during the warmer months . The meat is sold in the usual small markets , where the carcass is hung up , cut into pieces as customers come to buy , and is usually retailed entirely on the same day it is slaughtered . Some goat meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hair . Goat skins are an important by-product , and before the war many of these were exported . Shanghai was the chief point of export , with Tientsin second . Approximately 6,000,000 to 7,000,000 piculs were exported annually ' The skins for export were dried but were not cured in any way before being exported . Some goat hair and wool are collected in certain areas , mainly in the northwestern provinces . This may be combed out in the spring or the animal may be clipped . The long hair is used for twine from which grain bags are woven , and the shorter , finer under coat is used for making felt . Some goat fiber was exported , and the extent of Footnote  | this , before the present war , is indicated in the summary which is given along with the discussion of the marketing of sheep 's wool . Figure  | Small intestines were collected in considerable quantities prior to the war and preserved for export for use as casings . Milk is retailed in certain cities . With the exception of a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of distribution are essentially the same as those described for cattle . Adulteration is just as prevalent as it is with cow 's milk . In one section of Yunnan ( Lunan ) a type of cheese is said to be made from goat 's milk which resembles Roquefort in color and taste , except that it does not have green mold . Figure  | Breeding No data are available on the age of puberty in native goats , but casual observations indicate that at least some females come in estrus for the first time at 4 to 6 months of age . Many farmers do not breed these young does until a few months later in order to allow better growth , but the usual practice is to allow breeding whenever estrus occurs . Estrus apparently occurs at all seasons of the year in a part of the " Mah " goats which are found in the Chengtu area . Time of breeding was observed by Tang ( 1943 ) in 147 goats and the percentage of breedings in each season was as follows : Table Does would need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to determine accurately the extent of the breeding season and the proportion that actually will show estrus at the various seasons . Lu ( 1943 ) reports that the most active breeding season is from about mid-September to mid-October , as judged by the large numbers of kids born in February , March , and April . Tang ( 1943 ) also obtained information on the length of the estrous cycle in 17 females . It varied from 13 to 29 days , and the average was 20.8 days . The distribution of the lengths of the cycle is given below : Table Casual observations indicate that the estrous period lasts for from one to three days . The period of pregnancy is reported by Tang to vary from 139 to 152 days , and to average 148 days . Birth weights average from four to five pounds . Kids are weaned in the Chengtu area at 40 to 50 days of age . The average number of young per birth is reported by Tang to be 2.09 . In 56 births observed , the distribution of number of young per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these young was 101.7 ( 58 females and 59 males ) . Lu ( 1943 ) reports that approximately 85 percent successful breedings have resulted with the use of artificial insemination on goats in the Chengtu , Szechwan , area . Data are not available on goats in other portions of China , so it is not known whether the data on " Mali " goats are representative of the conditions that would be found in other types .  | In most areas castration is practiced , leaving only enough bucks intact to do the necessary breeding . In grassland areas the bucks run with the does the entire year . In farming areas some bucks are allowed to run with the does , while in other places the bucks may be kept separate . Bucks are kept only by one or a few individuals in some areas , and these bucks do the breeding for the other members of the community , for small service charges . Little selection has been done with the objective of improving milk production or other characteristics . The buck is kept as a necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is given to the selection of either superior bucks or does . Obviously , under these conditions , no definite breeding systems have been followed , and the native goats are generally inefficient producers of milk . The introduction of improved breeds of dairy goats apparently was made by missionaries , who brought them to China to supply milk for their families and for use in grading up native animals . More development has taken place in northern and northwestern China than in the southern portions . Some grading up has taken place around the cities and other places where herds of purebreds have been maintained , but very little actual data are available on the results obtained . Recent developments with goat breeding in Chengtu , Szechwan , indicate that the farmers are glad to have improved stock available for breeding . Madame Chiang Kai-shek arranged for the shipment of a few carefully selected Nubians from Hong Kong in 1939 , and these have been maintained at West China Union University under the supervision of Dickinson ( 1943 ) , where bucks have been made available for public service , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lu and Lu ( 1943 ) large numbers of the local does have been bred . The offspring are larger and produce considerably more milk than the native goats , but actual data on production are not available , so definite comparisons can not be made . They appear to be vigorous and thrive reasonably well under the local conditions but appear to be more susceptible to parasites than native goats , and this susceptibility may be a limiting factor in milk-goat improvement until preventive measures are available . Saanens , Toggenburgs , Swiss , and Nubians have been imported , but no definite figures are available on the proportions of each breed .  | Types Chinese swine may be divided roughly into two main classes , the North China and South China types . Little is known of the history of these two types but it seems probable that they originated from somewhat different wild strains . Allen ( 1940 ) states that the number of recognizable races of wild pig in China and Mongolia can be determined only by further study of a large series of specimens . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows : Sus scro f a raddeana in portions of Manchuria and Outer Mongolia ; Sus scrota moupinensis in Hopei , Shantung , Shansi , Shensi , Honan , southern Kansu , and much of Szechwan ; and Sus scrota chirodonta in Hupeh , Anhwei , and the other portions of China lying Figure  | south and east of these provinces . The rough dividing line between the two latter types is approximately the same as the boundary between the North and South China types , shown itt figure 64 . However , Allen points out that these two wild types differ only slightly . There is not sufficient information available to judge whether the existing domesticated types are directly descended from wild types indigenous to the same areas . The North China hogs are long , lean animals with long narrow heads , rather straight faces , and large ears . Black is the predominating color and white markings are rarely seen . The back is narrow and is usually straight or slightly sagging . The hams are very light . Wrinkles on the face are usually parallel and run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of growth is relatively slow , but sows are reported to be quite prolific . The South China pigs are shorter , broader-backed , more rotund , and the hams are somewhat larger , although not as plump as those found on most American and English breeds . The back usually sags more than in North China pigs . The head is short and rather wide , and the face is somewhat dished . Wrinkles on the face may be tortuous and tend to run at right angles to the long axis of the face . There is considerable variation in color in various areas , ranging from solid black to nearly white , and some animals are red or reddish-brown . The sows are reported to be less prolific than those of the North China types and the pigs grow more rapidly , but there is considerable variation among the South Chintz pigs . The hair is said to be somewhat softer than on the North China Pigs . The approximate dividing line between the two types is shown on the map in figure 64 . There is some intermingling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The hogs of North China may be divided into two classes , a large and a small type . There are gradations between these two extremes , and the descriptive terms , large , medium , and small , are sometimes used in describing the variations in type . Black strains predominate in many regions of South China , but Figure  | Figure white and black strains , such as Yungchang ( in Szechwan ) and Cantonese ( in Kwangtung ) , predominate in certain localities . Yungchang hogs are found principally in Yungchang hsien ( county ) and parts of Lungchang and Luchow hsiens to the south and west of Yungchang . ( See figure 67 . ) These hogs are white over most of the body and have black spots around the eyes , varying from narrow circles to large spots that include much of the head and ears . They are sometimes referred to as " bi-spectacled whites " . Some entirely white or nearly all white animals are seen . Adjacent to the home of the Yungchang hog there is a region where many black and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yungchang with black strains .  | Cantonese hogs are found in the vicinity of Canton and adjacent regions . There are not sufficient data available to outline this region accurately but the approximate area is shown in figure 64 . The predominating color is black and white . The hogs in this area have been described by Levine ( 1920 ) who states that colors range from nearly white to black , or black with white points . In some localities the ears are large and pendulant , in others they are small and erect , and in some communities both types are found . It seems probable then that this is the area from which most animals were exported from China for use in swine-breeding in Great Britain to help refine the coarser British hogs . Black hogs predominate in most other regions of South China , although some black and white pigs are found in Chekiang , Kwangsi , and Hunan Provinces , and animals with white markings are seen occasionally in other areas . Many of those found in Chekiang have a tendency toward " white belting " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head and rear quarters . The natives refer to them as " two-endsblack pigs " . Red or reddish-brown animals are frequently seen among the black strains , especially in the mountainous regions of Kweichow , Szechwan , and Sikong and similar regions to the north and south of this area . There is considerable variation in type within the black strains , even in adjacent areas . For example , the hogs around Neichiang , Szechwan , are larger , less chuffy , and somewhat later in maturing than those around Chengtu in the same province . Hogs in the mountainous regions tend to be somewhat leaner in ap-  | pearance than those of the more fertile lowland areas , but this may reflect differences in environment rather than in heredity . Pork is a favored article in the diet of the Chinese , and hogs are raised extensively in most areas occupied by Chinese . Chinese emigrants have taken hogs into Manchuria , mostly from Shantung , and these are described in the Japan-Manchukuo Yearbooks ( see Wang , 1942 ) as being black and of three types , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be of the North China type already described . Many of the areas of Mongolia , Tibet , much of Chinghai and Sikong , and parts of Sinkiang have little feed that is suitable for hogs , hence the swine population is low . In Sikong the pigs are small and for the most part exist on vegetation . They are much smaller and have shorter ears than those of the Chengtu area , east of Sikong , in Szechwan . Chengtu is the chief city through which trade passes to and from Sikong . Mohammedans of the northwestern areas do not eat pork , so few hogs are raised in areas where this group predominates . Owing to limited or total lack of available information concerning the swine in many localities of China , any description of types is necessarily incomplete . However , the foregoing descriptions and the photographs in figures 65 to 69 will indicate main types and some of the variations within these types . Other variations within type and details of subtypes can be filled in only as more information becomes available . Management and Feeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related activities in many provinces , such as Szechwan which has more hogs than any other province , may be summarized briefly as follows . Sows are kept by the relatively well-to-do farmers . The pigs are weaned at from 1 to 2 months of age and the majority of them are sold to poor farmers who feed them scantily for 2 to 5 months , then resell them as medium-sized feeders . These medium-sized feeders are fed mostly on roughage and farm refuse , to be converted into manure , after which they are again sold as large feeders . The medium-sized feeders are handled by small tenant farmers and others who desire them as a means of providing manure for their land . They sell these as large feeders to the well-to-do farmers and to proprietors of mills , oil presses , breweries , etc. , to be fed on fattening rations for two or three months , after which they go to market as slaughter hogs . The total feeding period , from weaning to slaughter , may vary from six months to as much as two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , but it serves to illustrate the essential pattern of swine production , in which animals are " stretched up " largely on roughage and under otherwise poor conditions of environment , after which they  | Figure are fattened for a brief period on relatively good-quality feeds . Available experimental evidence ( McMeekan , 1938 ) would indicate that this procedure tends to produce animals with relatively underdeveloped muscles and a high proportion of fat . The practices described above are not universal , however . In Shansi , for example , the common practice is for a farmer to buy a weanling pig and feed it to maturity or slaughter weight . Pigs may be housed in one portion of the farmhouse or in a shed built adjacent to it , or in one portion of a mill or other commercial establishment . The younger pigs may be tethered or allowed to run free during the day and put in the house or pen at night . The larger feeder pigs and the fattening pigs are usually kept confined . The pen in which they are kept may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and urine accumulate . This type is used where wood is plentiful . Others have a sloping stone floor with a pit at the side or outside . In still others the pigs may be put in a pit to which bedding is gradually added to keep it relatively clean and to soak up the urine . In the less intensive farming areas the pigs may be turned out to graze during the day and be put in their pens at night , or they may be allowed to graze day and night . In the more hilly regions , feeder hogs are herded during the day , being allowed to graze in harvested fields , on grassland , along streams , and in wooded areas . When put on a fattening ration , hogs are usually confined in a pen and remain there until they reach slaughter weight . The fattening pens are usually built in the back yard or in any secluded corner on the farms . On ordinary farms , not more than one to three hogs are usually fattened at one time . Manufacturing plants may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in an adjacent building . Feeding in these plants is often on a seasonal basis . For example ,  | the sugarcane plants operate for about four months during and after harvest and do most of their fattening of hogs during this period . Pigs are usually fattened in dark places without sunlight , and quarters are usually very unsanitary . Hsu . Peng , and Feng ( 1938 ) report work which indicates that large feeder hogs can be fattened successfully in such confinement , apparently because the feeding period is not sufficiently long to exhaust their store of vitamin D and because they are making less bone growth than younger pigs , but that the method of confinement without sunlight was not so satisfactory for the younger feeder pigs . In Chekiang , hogs are kept in a very dark room and the feed may be thrown in on top of the manure for the pigs to sort out . In Szechwan most sows are bred to farrow two litters a year . Parturition may occur at any time during the year , but the main farrowing seasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September to December for the fall crops . Thus the pigs are born at temperate seasons , for the most part , avoiding both the hot and the cold seasons for the suckling period . There is much variation in feeds and feeding methods . There are certain practices that prevail rather generally , however . There is a preponderance of coarse , high-fiber and low-protein content feeds in the diet of the growing pig . Fattening pigs receive a much more concentrated ration but the protein content is low . Grains are usually cracked or ground before feeding , and cooking of the feed is commonly practiced . Slop feeding is the rule . The calcium and salt contents of the ration are usually low . Figure  | Feeds that are in connnon use are listed below : Table The practice of cooking feeds has been shown by Hsu , Peng , and Feng ( 1938 ) to be undesirable . In two experiments in which cooked and raw feeds were compared , pigs grew just as rapidly and consumed 11 percent less feed per 100 catties of gain on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of . fuel for cooking the feed . They conclude that the cooking of naturally dry feedstuffs should be discouraged . This is in accord with results in other countries . Other feeding trials conducted by Hsu have brought out the following points : Rapeseed-oil meal was proven by Hsu ( 1941 ) not to be a dangerous feed for swine . It could be used up to 30 percent of the ration without ill effects . Ten percent was advised for all classes of swine to remedy the protein deficiency of the typical Chinese swine rations . When supplemented with 8 percent rapeseed-oil meal and 1 percent salt and bone meal , the typical farm ration gave quicker and more economical growth than when fed without these supplements . Rice bran alone was shown by Hsu ( 1941 ) to be entirely unsatisfactory as a feed for foreign purebreds . The maximum that could be fed to these animals was 25 percent of the ration , but for native hogs up to 50 percent could be used . Peanut-oil meal was shown to be a much more satisfactory protein supplement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly used by farmers in certain areas , proved to be more economical than corn and rice bran which is also commonly fed . Supplementing this ration with peanut-oil meal resulted in even faster and more economical gains . Supplementing with similar amounts of rapeseed-oil meal did not give as satisfactory results as the peanut-oil meal .  | Cracked rice and rice polish are used extensively in the Yungchang area for fattening hogs . Hogs made slower but more economical gains on a rice diet than when fed without a supplement of yellow corn ( Hsu , 1941 ) . Rice and rice polish fed with distillers ' grains , as is practiced by some farmers in this area , proved to be an ineffective and expensive type of ration . Feeders that are bought for fattening are usually placed in pens with four to six hogs in each group and given a fairly coarse ration at first . They are gradually shifted over to the fattening ration . In the sugarcane district the fattening period seldom exceeds three months and averages about two and one-third months . During this period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a long growing period without adequate feed , they put on gains at a rapid rate , gaining from 30 to 50 kilos during the feeding period . Sows are usually fed , except when nursing , on a very rough ration . It includes such items as broad-bean chaff ( sterns and leaves ) , vetch meal , fresh vegetable refuse , rice or wheat bran , brewers ' grains , and kitchen refuse . Feeds for sows are not usually cooked . Sows become quite thin and emaciated on the rations usually fed . Since Szechwan is the largest swine-producing province , a review of marketing procedures in that province is given to indicate market procedures . Somewhat different procedures are used in some other areas . A pig usually changes hands several times before it reaches the market as a fat hog ready for slaughter . First it is sold as a weanling , then as a small feeder , followed by later feeding stages , and finally as a butcher hog . Most of these transactions take place at market gatherings held at regular intervals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center for an area . At these market places , there is a hog yard where sellers , prospective buyers , and middlemen gather . Marketing usually begins in the early morning . Weanling pigs are bought in basketfuls , tetherers and small feeders in pairs , and larger feeder hogs in singles or bunches . Butcher hogs do not come to such markets . They are sold in the pen direct to butchers or professional buyers , except in a few large cities , such as Chungking and Chengtu , where special fat-hog markets are provided . Bargains are made in various manners . In most places hogs are bought and sold on the head basis . The owner asks so much for his animal and the buyer makes an offer , both to the middleman with finger signals in the sleeves . The middleman or commission man then goes through many motions with much loud talking until a deal is closed . He usually gets 2 to 3 percent , borne either by both parties or by one , depending on local custom . Since neither party knows what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other  | Figure party to the deal it is easy for the middleman to cheat both , getting more than his stipulated commission . Since ownership often changes so many times during the life of a pig , these unregulated middlemen place quite a financial burden on swine producers . In some localities pigs are sold on a weight basis , in which case the bargain is on a per catty basis . In some such cases the actual weight is not determined but is merely estimated . Most weanling pigs are taken immediately after weaning to the  | market for sale . A few are retained for breeding and some are sold directly to neighboring farmers . The smaller pigs command higher prices per unit weight than larger ones . Weanling pigs usually range from 10 to 20 catties per head . Weanling pigs are usually tied with a straw rope around the neck or chest for convenience in handling at the Figure  | market and afterward . They are fed reasonably well for the period following weaning and may be taken out on leash by children or old women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient to maintain good growth , and after a month or so , even though they have gained a few catties , they have changed from plump , slick-haired weanlings to pot-bellied , rough-haired animals with relatively large heads , bulging eyes , and weak limbs . Some are again led to market for sale as tethering pigs . Whether or not they are resold at this stage , they are then allowed to roam about , picking up anything that is edible ; they may be given some liquid garbage , and sometimes a little rice bran may be added to the ration . They are then ready for resale as feeder pigs . Most feeder pigs are sold at market gatherings . They are rarely weighed . They are divided into three categories , small , medium , and large . These have the following approximate ranges in weight : 40 to 70 ; 70 to 100 ; and 100 catties up , respectively . In rural areas buyers purchase the fat hogs direct from the farmer while they are still in the feeding pen . The buyer estimates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weights are seldom taken . Since the buyer is trained in evaluating weights and carcass yields , the farmer is at an obvious disadvantage in these deals . The large consuming centers maintain fat-hog markets . For example , there are four in Chengtu . These have a large central open space , with open sheds built around the four sides . Each yard has an owner or manager in charge , one clerk , and a number of commission men . Markets are held at regular intervals , and all do not operate on the same day . Fat hogs are taken to market in several ways . One or two animals may be strapped on their backs on a wheelbarrow , with leaves or straw under them for padding , and pushed to market . Boats are used along the streams that lead to markets , 20 to 30 hogs being jammed in one boat . Animals are also carried , either suspended on a board framework or on boards on top of two poles after the fashion of a sedan chair , being taken to market by two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance does not exceed five kilometers . One or two or more up to the point of good-sized droves are taken in this way . Heavy hogs walking to market often become footsore and are shod with straw shoes . The ears may be fastened back to the head by tying or sewing together to enable the animals to see better , and in some cases the eyelids are also suspended by sewing . Another method is for a man to carry a hog , strapped to his back . Prices vary with the type of animal and the season . Small weanling pigs command the highest prices and large feeders the lowest , per unit weight . Top prices are received at two seasons , March and April ,  | and November and December . These are the busiest farrowing periods , hence there is the smallest number of weanling pigs for sale . Prices of large feeders and pork do not vary as much within the year as do prices of the smaller animals . Gilts for breeding are usually bought while still in the litter , or at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , run-down sow or a pregnant one is brought to market gatherings . Pregnant sows bring a much higher price than non-pregnant ones . There is very little market for boars . Young boars are discarded from breeding , castrated and fattened , before being placed on the market . Methods of slaughter will not be discussed in detail here . There are many local variations , of course , that would require careful observation to describe in detail . In some places , the practice has developed of pumping water into the carcass to increase the weight . This bad practice is in the same degraded category as putting water in milk to increase the volume . Slaughtering usually begins about midnight , so the carcass can be in the retailer 's hands early the next morning . The carcass is exposed in open-air markets until sold . It is cut in strips , diagonally across the carcass , and practically all parts of the carcass command the same price . The head and intestines sell for about one half the price of the main portion of the carcass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carcass itself per catty . Kidney fat , for example , usually brings 1.5 to 2 times the price of fresh pork . Most pork is sold in the fresh , unchilled state and with the skin on . Meat is also cooked with the skin on . Some hams are cured , and prior to the war some of these were exported . These hams are usually cured in the fall and winter . The native method is to salt the ham , using 1 pound of salt per 16 pounds of meat . It is then sunned for about one week and hung up in a cool place . Mold grows on the surface the next summer . It is usually eaten after about one year but is considered best after two or three years . The flavor is quite strong . Bristles Bristles are an important by-product of the slaughterhouse . Those along the withers and backbone are usually plucked and bundled separately by butchers . Longer bristles from along the sides of the backbone are scraped off black hogs , and some hairs from other parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bundled with them . In white hogs , the bristles along the back and on either side are all plucked out . This accounts for the higher yield of marketable white bristles and for certain differences in the processing of the two colors of bristles . Generally , 80 to 90 catties of finished product are obtained from each 100 catties of white bristles , and 65 to 70 from each 100 black ones .  | Bristles are collected from butchers by jobbers or by small shops in the villages and sold to city dealers in raw condition . They must be dried to avoid spoilage during transport and storage . Jobbers usually do some sorting on the basis of length to make the bundles more uniform and attractive to dealers . Final processing is usually done in large cities , of which Chungking is the most important center . The processing of black bristles is relatively simple , the essential steps being as follows : soak in water for 10 to 20 days to loosen dirt and to allow attached particles of skin to degenerate ; wash , steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin boards , dry , then grade into length classes and put in rolls . The processing of white bristles is much more elaborate . They are soaked in water for 24 hours , then bleached with sodium peroxide . After this they are exposed to sulfur fumes , dried , and the black and yellow bristles picked out . This is followed by a second and a third bleaching , after which they are again exposed to sulfur fumes . They are then de-sulfurized with sodium hyposulfite , after which soft bristles are combed out , straightened , and placed on bamboo slats , and dried . They are then ready for grading into length groups , inspection , and packing . The Yungchang hog , described earlier , is perhaps the most important source of white bristles . There are , of course , some variations of the processes outlined above . Normal bristle production in Szechwan before the present war was about 16,000 piculs ( 1 picul = 60.5 kilograms ) of black and 3,000 piculs of white ones per year . Actually about 6,000 piculs were brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Kansu provinces . They were gathered along the two main water routes , the Yangtze and the Chialing Rivers . Bristle exports have decreased during the war , and owing to wartime conditions no distinction is being made by foreign buyers between black and white bristles . Owing to the greater cost of processing the white ones , emphasis is now being shifted to the black bristles for current export trade . In the dressing or grading of bristles into length groups , they are usually sorted into bundles ranging from 11/z to 6 inches , by 1/4-inch gradations . Sometimes finer distinctions are made . A few bristles in excess of 6 inches are found but they are of minor importance . Prior to the war the carcass of a slaughter hog yielded the butcher about $30 and the bristles about $6 to $7 . Thus the bristles accounted for approximately one sixth of the value of the animal . Pig skins are used in some areas for the making of leather for suitcases .  | Breeding Boars are usually kept by poor or disabled farmers . In some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a lowly occupation . The boar travels in some localities , while in others the sow is brought to the boar for breeding . Each traveling boar covers an area about five kilometers in radius . During the rush season a boar may serve five to six sows per day . The owner usually is required to pay a service charge at the time of service , and after the sow is either pregnant or has given birth , an additional charge equivalent to the current price of one catty of weanling pig . Boarkeepers are sometimes referred to as boar chasers because they follow their boars from one farmhouse to another . Their usual practice is to buy a male pig from a farmer , and it is usually one of the smaller ones from a litter since the small ones cost less and will eat less . The boar is raised on the same poor diet as is common for tethering and small feeder pigs , consisting largely of roughage , until about 5 months of age . After that it serves regularly until 10 months or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market . Young ones are easier to drive and to maintain and are more apt to be willing breeders . Farmers usually feed their developing breeding gilts very poorly , yet they seem to survive and give reasonably satisfactory breeding performance in spite of this poor treatment . An experiment conducted by Hsu and Peng ( 1942 ) in which gilts were kept on a wellbalanced ration , as compared with the typical farm ration , indicated that the well-fed gilts would produce more and heavier pigs per litter at the first farrowing than the poorly fed gilts . Differences were less marked at the second farrowing . Individual sows are usually kept in pens of about 10 x 10 feet and the floor is either dirt or is paved with stone or board sloping to one side for drainage into a gutter from which refuse collects into a tank . Sows are confined to this pen except when removed for mating or to be sold . Farmers seldom bother to remember breeding dates or to calculate the expected time of parturition . Some straw bedding may be thrown in at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but otherwise the sow is left largely to herself during and for several days after farrowing . Many farmers do not even know the size of the litter or the sex of the pigs until well after farrowing . Luckily , the Chinese sow appears to be a good mother , and death losses during the suckling period are relatively small . Spaying and castration are both commonly practiced . This is usually done at 4 to 6 weeks , by local practitioners who charge so much per litter for performing the operation . Castration may be done on the farm , while spaying is frequently done at the market at the time the weanling pigs are being sold , or both operations may be  | done at once on the farm . The practitioners are very clever at the spaying operation , accomplishing it very quickly . The work reviewed below was conducted at National Central University and was largely financed by a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation in connection with its rural-reconstruction program in China . From February 1936 to October 1937 the work was conducted at Nanking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the herd were moved to Chungking and then to Chengtu . After the move to Chengtu , the Szechwan Provincial Government cooperated with National Central University in the work until it was concluded in 1941 . Owing to wartime conditions some of the data were lost ; the work is inadequate in some respects , and not as complete as could be desired in other respects , but these appear to be the only data of their kind in existence . Much of the information has been published in Chinese by Hsu and co-workers . The Chinese swine used at Nanking were of the North China type , with the exception of a few from Chekiang that were intermediate , while those at Chengtu were of the South China type . Rations used at Nanking were comparable to those commonly fed under conditions of good management in the United States , but tankage was not available at Chengtu so only vegetable protein was supplied . A survey of levels of fertility on farms in four sections of Szechwan , including the Chengtu , Yungchang , and Neichiang areas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the four areas and averaged 8.8 . In 31 sows native to the Chiangpei area of Kiangsu , an average litter size of 13.9 was observed . Tong ( 1943 ) cites an exceptional case of a North China black sow , kept at Minghsien College , that had 32 tests and produced 25 live pigs in one litter . Levine ( 1920 ) states that in the Canton area a sow is supposed to be able to nurse at least 10 pigs , which seems to be the average for the region , although as many as 15 are frequently seen with one sow . Thus it appears that the Cantonese sows are more prolific than those in some other parts of South China . Chinese pigs are reputed to develop sexually more rapidly than modern breeds . Chinese animal-husbandry workers cite instances of gilts being bred by litter-mate boars before 60 days of age . Gilts are usually bred when about 5 months old , but earlier breedings are common , and Chinese workers say that it is not unusual to find gilts farrowing at about 6 months of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Phillips and Zeller ( 1943 ) with the Poland China breed , in which spermatozoa were first observed in the testes at 20 weeks of age , and in which large- and small-type gilts exhibited first estrus at 198.7 and 207.8 days , respectively . Hsu and Peng ( 1942 ) studied 10  | gilts of the type found in the vicinity of Neichiang . Szechwan . Five were on a standard and five on a typical farm ration and the average ages of first estrus were 88.6 and 108 days , respectively . First estrus averaged 5.2 and 5.8 days in length and later estrous periods were shorter , the average for the groups varying between 2.0 and 3.0 days after the second estrus . These gilts were checked for estrus twice daily . Pigs from Chiangpei in Kiangsu Province and Chinhua in Chekiang were compared and both types were about equal in rate of growth . The Chinhua pigs had more subcutaneous and less kidney fat than those from Chiangpei . These regions are on the borderline between the North and South China types . The Chinhua pigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more like the South China type than those of Chiangpei , and the black and white markings indicate that they may be intermediate between the North China and a black-andwhite strain of the South China type . Relatively few data are available concerning the feed-lot performance of the native pigs . Some of these data will be summarized along with the data on crosses with American and English breeds . Some data , not involved in those studies , are summarized here . Four pens of pigs purchased in the Chiangpei , Kiangsu , area were fed for varying periods , and the results are summarized in table 2 . . A direct comparison was not made with pigs from the vicinity of Chinhua , Chekiang , but six of the latter type were fed in an experiment to compare growth rates of pigs confined in sunlight and in a dark room . This work was stimulated by the common practice among Chinese farmers of confining their pigs in dark quarters . The data are summarized in table 3 . A comparison of the performance of three strains of Szechwan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the types differed in time of fattening and in weight when it was most profitable to market them . Small , black pigs from Chengtu were at their optimum conditions at 180 cattiesl ( about 198 pounds ) , larger black pigs from Neichiang at 250 catties ( about 273 pounds ) , and Yungchang pigs at 210 catties ( about 231 pounds ) . At lower weights they were not fat enough to please the public demand for a fat carcass , and if fed longer the gains became too expensive . Some data obtained on animals being slaughtered in the normal course of business in the Chengtu , Neichiang , and Yungchang markets are summarized in table 4 . Hsu and Peng ( 1941 ) studied the performance of six sows from the Neichiang , Szechwan , and eight from the Yungchang , Szechwan , area , including performance of the sows and their progeny . The data Footnote  | are summarized in table 5 . The pigs were weaned at 10 weeks and put on feed at 13 weeks of age . Average or medium-sized pigs in each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small ones being discarded . The number of pigs farrowed is much higher than that cited earlier as the average for farm sows of this type . These sows were especially selected and were maintained under much better conditions than are commonly found on farms . The Neichiang pigs grew at a more rapid rate over the entire feeding period but the greatest difference occurred after the pigs reached 220 catties . The Neichiang pigs made more efficient gains , and the difference of 67.6 catties in feed required per 100 catties gain was statistically significant . The carcasses of the Yungchang pigs were somewhat fatter , owing to slower growth and a longer fattening period . Table Table  | Table Table Levine ( 1920 ) reports that 12 hogs fed at the Canton Christian College made an average daily gain , at 6 months of age , of about 0.65 pound a day on full feed , and that these pigs usually weighed between 200 and 250 pounds at 1 year of age . The average dressing percent of 32 hogs was 72.5 . The studies in which native pigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summarized below . Owing to the different native types used in work at Nanking and Chengtu , the work at the two locations is reviewed separately . Work at Nanking . The modern breeds involved in this work were Berkshire , Chester White , Duroc-Jersey , Hampshire , and Large York-  | shire . The Duroc-Jersey and Yorkshire hogs were rather large and rangy , while the hogs of the other four breeds were of a smaller , more compact type . Native pigs were of the North China type and came from the vicinity of Chiangpei , Kiangsu . Numbers were limited and the modern breeds were grouped together for some comparisons with the native pigs . Loss of original records , owing to wartime conditions , makes it impossible to indicate the proportions of the various modern breeds in some of these cases . All pigs were given comparable treatment , and the management and feeding were as near to generally accepted American standards as the working conditions permitted . The ration generally used included corn , tankage , soybean-oil meal , bonemeal , and salt . In feeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ration ranged from about 16.6 percent at the beginning to about 12.9 percent at the end . The duration of gestation was similar in all groups . The average length of 32 gestations in modern sows was 115.8 ? 0.51 days ; in 21 gestations in native sows it was 115.1 ? 0.39 ; and in five Fl sows mated to modern boars , it averaged 113.6 ? 0.87 . The interval between deliveries of individual pigs at parturition in the above modern and native sows averaged 23.21-4.18 and 19.7 ? 2.68 minutes , respectively , and the difference was not statistically significant . Pigs from sows of modern breeds were somewhat heavier than those from native sows at birth . The average weight of 334 pigs of modern breeds was 2.06 ? 0.04 catties . Eighty-eight native pigs averaged 1.61 ? 0.04 and 314 crossbred pigs out of native sows averaged 1.69 ? 0.03 . Differences between various groups are shown below , with their standard errors : Table The native sows were smaller and had larger litters than the modern sows , which at least partially accounts for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this work averaged 1.86 catties and the 346 female pigs 1.84 catties at birth , and the difference was not significant . The sex ratio was 133.5 . The Chinese sows are reported to be good mothers and the available data bear out this belief . Data on survival to weaning ( at 10 weeks of age ) are summarized in table 6 . The changes in weight of the sows owing to reproduction indicates that the loss is greater in the native sows . Sixteen modern sows  | averaged 317 catties before parturition . They lost an average of 40.8 catties during parturition and 38.4 during the 10-weeks lactation , a total of 79.2 . Eighteen native sows averaged 285.7 catties before parturition , lost 47.1 and 46.0 catties , respectively , at parturition and during lactation , or a total of 93.1 . The Chinese sows , being smaller , consumed less feed than the modern sows during lactation . During 1936 the average daily feed consumption of four sows of each type was 9.93 and 12.1 catties per head . Duing 1937 the sows had access to green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ averaging 8.84 catties daily for 12 modern sows and 7.73 for 11 native sows . An interesting comparison was made of the combined feed consumption of the sow and pig during the nursing period . The data are summarized in table 7 . The difference in efficiency of production , thus measured , was 94.9 ? 21.29 catties . The native sows were raising hybrid pigs , however ; hence there is not a direct comparison of the modern and native types . Table Data on performance of various breeds and crosses during the feeding period are summarized in tables 8 , 9 , and 10 . Carcass data were obtained on some of these groups , and certain interesting items from these data are summarized in tables 9 and 10.  | The rate of growth in the native pigs was slower than that in either the modern purebred or the modern X Chinese groups that were fed . Native pigs required about 281 days from birth , on the average , to reach market weight ( about 180 catties ) , while crossbred pigs ( sired by modern boars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 73 days less to reach the same weight . Differences in efficiency of feed utilization were not nearly so marked . In the groups for which data are summarized in table 9 , the two native lots required the largest amounts of feed per unit gain , while in the groups summarized in table 10 , the two native groups fall within the range of the crossbred groups . The dressing percentages available for various groups , including some animals in addition to those listed in previous tables , are summarized in table 11 . The native groups fall within the range of the purebreds and crossbreds . Some definite differences appear in the mode of fat deposition . The data for caul and kidney fats are summarized in table - 12 . All the differences listed in the lower half of this table are significant and indicate that the native pigs put on relatively more caul and kidney fat than the modern breeds , while the crossbreds are intermediate in this respect . The few pigs from Chinhua , Chekiang , that were studied were similar to the crossbreds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5.10 ? 0.70 catties , but they were slaughtered at somewhat lighter weights than the other animals and at equal weights would probably have been nearer to the other native pigs . Table  | Table  | Table Back fat was significantly thicker in native and crossbred pigs than in the modern group , but the crossbred and native pigs did not differ significantly . The data are summarized in table 13 . The few Chinhua , Chekiang , pigs , which were slaughtered at somewhat lighter weights , had a thickness of back fat of 5.66 ? 0.32 cm. , or nearly as thick as that of the crossbreds and Chiangpei , Kiangsu , natives . Thickness of skin was greatest in the native , lowest in the modern , and intermediate in the crossbred pigs . The data are summarized in table 13 . In the Chinhua , Chekiang , pigs , thickness of skin was similar to the modern pigs , averaging 0.2 cm.  | In an effort to determine fundamental reasons for differences in growth rate between modern and native pigs , certain organs were weighed or measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lightest in the natives . The means and differences are shown in table 13 . The small intestine was longest in the modern breeds and shortest in the native . The means and differences are shown in table 14 . Length of the large intestine was similar in the various groups and the small differences were not significant . Table  | Work in Chengtu . Native swine used were of two types , the rather large black pigs found in the vicinity of Neichiang , Szechwan , and the " bispectacled " white pigs typical of the Yungchang , Szechwan , area . The rations used in feeding trials were balanced according to the same standard used at Nanking , but tankage was not available and all the protein was of plant origin . Berkshire , Chester White , Yorkshire , and Poland China boars were used to sire crossbred pigs , and , the data on performance of these and native pigs are summarized in table 15 . All the crossbred groups grew at a more rapid rate and their gains were somewhat more efficient . No material differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small intestine and in deposition of fat , the native litters falling between the extremes observed in crossbreds in most of these measures , the only exceptions being caul and kidney fat in which the Yungchang native pigs showed the highest levels of any of the groups . Bristles have been an important source of income . It is not possible to predict the future importance of bristles but much depends on developments in the synthetic bristle industry . Native Chinese hogs have longer and stiffer bristles than the modern hogs of the United States , and the methods of management result in a much longer period for bristle growth before the hogs are slaughtered . Under pre-war Table  | Table conditions white bristles were more valuable than black , and the Yungchang hogs were one of the chief sources of white bristles . Data on bristle length at the end of the feeding period were obtained on the animals for which performance data are presented in table 15 . Data on bristle length are summarized in the same table . They are inconclusive , owing to small numbers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native animals in length . However , bristles on the crossbreds were not as stiff as those on the native animals . In the various feeding trials summarized in preceding portions of this paper , the animals were maintained under experiment-station conditions , with management and feeding practices as comparable with those used in the United States as the circumstances permitted . Conditions under which Chinese pigs are commonly raised and fed are quite different , and these conditions have already been described . A limited test was made of the performance of some native , modern purebred , and crossbred pigs under experiment-station conditions until they weighed from approximately 100 to 150 pounds . They were then distributed to farmers to be fed in their own way . Weights were taken at intervals of four weeks until the pigs were approximately 1 year old . The data are summarized in table 16 . Obviously , the numbers are too limited to permit definite conclusions . Study of the data does not indicate definite superiority of any of the three general groups ( native , modern purebred , and crossbred ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to determine the adaptability to Chinese farm conditions of the modern breeds and crosses between these and native types .  | Types The chickens of China are a heterogeneous mixture for the most part . Large and small types , feathered and clean-legged types , crested and non-crested birds , and a variety of plumage colors and comb types can be found in almost any area . Little organized breeding has been done . Chickens are frequently carried from one village to another for presentation to friends and relatives as gifts . Many of these remain alive and interbreed with the birds of the village to which they are taken . Consequently there has been much mingling of local types , and most places have quite a mixture . Figure  | Figure Observations and discussions with workers from various portions of the country do indicate , however , that certain localities have types that are more or less distinct . A type that is similar to the Cochin is raised in the Yangtze Valley . It is also called Shantung chicken , owing to a belief that it originally came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have feathered legs . They may or may not have a crest . Mature birds are reported to weigh up to nine catties . A type is raised in Kiangsu and possibly in other areas which is called Langshan . It is said to have originated in the northeastern provinces . It is black , has feathered legs , and weighs up to eight catties at maturity . A type called Yuchi or oil chicken is found in the vicinity of Peiping . There is considerable variation in size ( two or three , up to six catties ) and some are crested and some non-crested . They are quite fat , hence the name oil chicken . They are also reasonably good egg producers , apparently , for it is reported that by some selection within the native non-crested type , egg production has been raised through selection by James A. Hunter to an average of about 150 per year according . to Tong ( 1943 ) , the best birds producing as high as 200 eggs . The native non-crested hens are reported to average about 110 eggs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Silkies are said to be found to some extent in Kiangsi and may exist in other provinces . They weigh one to one and one-half catties . Feathers are white and the skin is black . Bones are also black . A type called Sheokwang is found in Shantung that is reputed to produce large eggs . Tong ( 1943 ) reports that eight hens from purchased eggs averaged about 120 eggs in a laying year , and that the average egg weight was approximately 80 grams . Common colors are black , spotted gray , and yellow . Hens weigh about five and cocks six catties . Another type is called Hsiaoshan . This type is found in Chekiang and is uniformly yellowish in color . They tend toward a dual-purpose  | type , being reasonably good for both egg and meat production . Mature hens are reported to weigh about five catties . There are no doubt other types that may be sufficiently distinct to justify listing as separate from the heterogeneous mixtures usually found , but there is not sufficient information at hand to justify further listings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat from those in the farming regions of central and southern China . In the latter regions , the chickens tend toward the large meaty type , while in the northwest the tendency is toward the smaller egg-laying type , with some that tend definitely toward the game type . Little information is available concerning the egg-producing ability of the chickens of various types and in various areas . In addition to the figures already cited , Tong ( 1943 ) quotes the results of three experiments conducted by James A. Hunter , Raymond T. Moyer , and himself which indicate that the native chickens studied averaged 50 to 70 eggs per year . The Japan-Manchukuo Yearbooks ( 1938-39-40 ) , reviewed by Wang ( 1942 ) , state that the chickens of Manchuria are mostly of native type , that egg production is less than 100 eggs per bird per year , and that large-type native birds average about 60 eggs , but no actual data are given . Trials conducted by Lingnan University indicate that the native chickens around Canton produce about 60 eggs per year ( Tong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were kept in enclosures and were fed a standard improved ration . Ko ( 1940 ) studied the size of eggs on the Chengtu market and also the size of eggs produced by local native chickens and certain purebreds maintained at Central University . The average egg sizes ( in grams ) observed were as follows : Chengtu market eggs , 49.79 ; native eggs , 51.57 ; Langshan eggs , 57.46 ; Leghorn eggs , 52.63 ; Rhode Island Red eggs , 53.82 ; and Barred Plymouth Rock eggs , 51.31 . Some data have been collected by Hsu and Fan ( 1943 ) on egg production , egg size , age at first egg , and growth in certain native types . These data are summarized below : numbers are limited so naturally can not be considered adequate to represent the average characteristics of the various types , but they do indicate something of the level of production . The three groups studied were black birds that were native to Yishan in Kwangsi Province , Silkies , and birds that were native to Kiangsi Province . Data on egg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May , inclusive ) are summarized below : Table  | Egg size was determined for some birds of these groups . The averages are indicated below : Table The average for the black Yishan natives was obtained from 14 hens and the range in average for each hen was from 36.3 to 44.3 grams . Age of first egg was determined on nine black Yishan and nine Kiangsi native hens . The range for black Yishan natives was 132 to 225 days , with an average of 165.4 , while the Kiangsi natives ranged from 132 to 177 and averaged 152.6 days . Weight at 200 days for 13 black Yishan birds was 1.14 kilos and for 12 Kiangsi native birds was 0.82 kilo . Management and Feeding The aggregate number of chickens in China is large , but they do not occupy a large place in farming operations on the average farm . They function more as scavengers and utilizers of table and other refuse . A survey made by Buck ( 1937 ) indicated that the most common number of chickens on the individual farm is three , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided for chickens is not elaborate , and many types are found . Bamboo coops or large baskets with a small opening at the top may be used for housing at night or where it is not convenient to allow the chickens to run loose during the day . Wooden crates with slat bottoms may be used in areas where lumber is plentiful . A type of adobe house is used in Hopeh . This consists of a cell about 3 X 3 X 3 feet . It has only one opening , about 1.5 feet from the ground on one side and large enough for the birds to go in and out . Poles are laid in the adobe as the house is built , about one foot from the ground , which serve as roosts . The small opening is closed with a board or other cover at night . There is no provision for ventilation or for cleaning out the manure that collects under the roosts . An improved modification of this type has been developed which has openings for ventilation and for cleaning . Some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time of building , so that there is ventilation at night even though the birds are closed in for protection . In some sections and on some farms no housing is provided , the chickens simply being allowed to run about and find a place to roost wherever they may choose for the night . The chief feeds for chickens are whatever they pick up from foraging about the farm , and scraps from the table . Some grain is fed , the kind depending upon the grain raised in that area . There are reports  | that maggots are raised for feeding poultry in some sections of Fukien and Hunan , but this is apparently practiced to only a limited extent . There is no well-organized marketing procedure . Eggs and live or dressed birds are taken to the local marketing centers and sold by the growers on market days , or sold to retailers who resell them to the consuming public . Some purchasing is done in the country by middlemen who in turn take the eggs or birds to market . Figure  | Dried eggs were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of these were prepared at points along railroads in the northern portion of China and in Shanghai . Breeding Perhaps the best characterization of breeding practices with chickens in China is to say that nature has simply taken its course . With the exception of a few institutions that have tried in a small way to improve the native types by selection , there has been no attempt to improve the native stock . In fact , selection may have been against such a character as large egg size , owing to a general tendency to sell large eggs for human food and reserve small eggs for hatching . Cocks usually run with the hens throughout the year . Some castrating of males is practiced to produce capons for marketing . The method of incubating eggs in hatcheries is different from that developed in other countries . The natives of Tungchangfu , Shantung , have practiced a method for generations , passing it on from father to son , that will serve to illustrate the principle used . Hatcheries employ these operators on a contract basis , the company advancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence and paying his and his apprentice 's expenses for the hatching period . The operator guarantees the hatchery a hatch of 85 percent of the fertile eggs . At the end of the hatching season , the operator receives % of the net profit . The eggs for hatching are purchased by trained buyers from farms in the vicinity . The incubator is a kang or earthern bed , under which a fire is built for heating . Each kang is about 6 feet wide , 10 feet long , and 3 feet high . Two decks are built above this , one about 4 feet from the kang and the second about 4 feet from the first . The kang is covered with a sheet of felt and the eggs laid on top of it . The eggs are then covered with a cotton quilt . The temperature is about 110 ? F. , but no thermometers are used by the native operators , who determine the temperature by touching the egg to some sensitive part of the skin such as the eyelid . The eggs remain on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by sunlight and the fertile ones placed on the first deck above the kang . Here they are covered with a quilt and kept for one week , at a temperature of about 105 ? F. They are then candled a second time and all the live ones placed on the top deck and covered with a quilt . The temperature is about 95 ? F. The entire room is also at about this same temperature . When the first peep is heard the quilt is removed from the top deck . As the chickens hatch they are removed and kept in the incubating room to dry . If business is rushing , the chicks may be sold to peddlers as soon as dry . Otherwise , they are kept for about 24 hours and then sold . Incubation usually begins about the middle of July .  | Another method of incubation which is practiced in some areas is to provide the heat with hot rice . This is more commonly used with duck eggs but is also used in some areas for the incubation of chicken eggs . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar to that outlined below . A wooden barrel is used which is just a little larger at the top than at the bottom . This barrel is approximately 87 cm. high and 60 and 57 ems . in diameter at the top and bottom , respectively . The barrel is lined with about 3 to 3.5 cm. of straw and a stronger layer of paper is placed inside this . Approximately 13 cm. of rice hulls are placed in the bottom of the barrel and covered with paper . A layer of heated rice is placed on top of the paper . Eggs are placed in fishnet sacks , about 60 to the sack . Two sacks of eggs are then placed in the barrel , one around the outside and one in the center . A layer of warm rice about 6.6 cm. deep is placed on the eggs . This process is repeated until the barrel is filled to the proper level , and a barrel , of the size indicated above , holds 14 layers , or a total of 1,680 eggs . A layer of paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 3.3 cm. of warm rice poured on top of this . If the weather is cold a second layer of paper and rice may be added , and if quite cold a third layer of paper and a cotton pad will be placed on top of this . The rice is heated to 45 ? 50 ? C. and placed in a special container . A total of about 120 catties is needed for each batch of eggs . Two barrels are used , and the eggs are shifted from one barrel to the other with each change of rice , so that 60 catties must be heated each time . ' When put in contact with the eggs it is about 40 ? but operators determine if it is at the proper temperature by placing it against the eyelid . Approximately 2 catties of pork fat or tea-seed oil is mixed with the 120 catties of rice to make it smooth . This is added gradually during the first two or three days of incubation . The first change of rice is made after two hours , then changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more frequent than this in cold weather and less frequent in warm weather . With each change the eggs that were in the top go to the bottom of the barrel , and in each layer the sack that was on the outside goes to the inside . Turning of the eggs is accomplished by the process of picking up the fish-net sacks and putting them down again in the second barrel . The temperature of the eggs is usually about 35 ? at the time a change of rice is made . The process of changing requires about 10 minutes . Chicken eggs are kept in the hot rice for 14 days . After this they are producing enough heat themselves so that a layer of hot rice is required only at the bottom and top of the barrel . Later on the top layer may be omitted . The eggs are moved every eight hours or so , as usual . At the end of 16 or 17 days the eggs are removed from the barrel and put on a traylike arrangement . Each  | tray may be about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep . It is made of wood . The sides of the tray are lined with several layers of paper . A layer of rice hulls about 3.3 cm. deep is placed on the bottom and covered with a straw mat . The eggs are placed on top of this mat and covered with several layers of paper . The number of layers depends on the weather , and if it is cold , a quilt may be added . The eggs are checked at frequent intervals to make sure that the proper temperature is being maintained . They remain on this tray until they hatch . Eggs are candled at the 5th or 6th day and again at 10 to 14 days . Final candling is usually done at 18 or 19 days . Various observers report that White Leghorns , Rhode Island Reds , Barred Plymouth Rocks , Black Orpingtons , White Wyandottes , and other breeds have been introduced into China . Many of these have been brought in by missionaries , and various institutions have made importations . No definite information is at hand on the times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very few data at hand to show the results obtained in grading-up operations . Considerable data are no doubt available and should be brought together and assembled in sufficiently complete form to indicate what improvement has resulted from the use of the various breeds , both in egg and meat production . Observations by various workers indicate that grading up with such breeds as the White Leghorn , Rhode Island Red , and Barred Plymouth Rock resulted in increased egg production as compared with the native types . Results with the White Leghorn may not have been so satisfactory from the standpoint of meat production , and this result would be anticipated owing to the differences in the purebred types . In the Japan-Manchukuo Yearbooks ( 1938-39-40 ) it is stated according to Wang ( 1942 ) that Leghorns , Rhode Island Reds , and a Japanese breed had been introduced into Manchuria , but no data are given to indicate the results obtained . Data have been accumulated on a limited number of hybrids between Single-Comb White Leghorns and two native groups in preliminary work by Hsu and Fan ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranges in age at first egg and the average age in each group are shown below : Table  | The Kweilin group were native of that area in Kwangsi Province , and the Hunan group were native to the area around Hengyang in that province . The average egg sizes observed in three groups were as follows : White Leghorn , 53.6 grams ; Leghorn X Kweilin ( F1 ) , 37.9 ; and Leghorn X Hunan , 43.7 grams . Average weights of birds in these groups at 200 days were as follows : Table  | Ducks Types There are several types of ducks in China that are recognized as being distinct . These are described briefly below . Peiping ducks are white in color , with yellow beaks and feet . The females weigh about five catties and the drakes six to seven catties . Nanking ducks are either white with yellow beaks and feet like the Peiping ducks , or they are brownish gray with a speckled pattern . The majority are of the latter color . They weigh about one catty less than the Peiping ducks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced in Sikong and in parts of Szechwan , Kwangtung , and Kwangsi Provinces , and in some other places . They are rather large , weighing somewhat more than the Peiping ducks . Colors are either white or black , with red pigmented areas around the base of the beak and the eyes . Black is the predominant color . The ducks of the rice-growing areas which do not fall in the above classes might also be listed as a type . They are small , weighing two to three catties when mature . The most common color is brownish gray , in a speckled pattern . Some other colors are also seen . Ko ( 1940 ) studied the size of duck eggs in three types and found the averages to be as follows : Chengtu , 57.75 grams ; Nanking , 63.65 grams ; and Peiping , 72.82 grams . Management and Feeding Ducks , like chickens , are used to a considerable extent as scavengers , but the business is somewhat specialized . The most common number on farms , according to Buck ( 1937 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 , but in some instances there are as many as 100 or even 500 . The business of preparing them for market is more specialized also . In Szechwan the common practice is to feed ducks first at about 2 days of age , when they are given cooked rice and some rice bran . As soon as they are able to scavenger for themselves , they hunt their own food in ponds and rice fields with occasional supplemental grain feeding , until they are about 2 months old . Bands of them are then collected by professional herders who fatten them as they are driven to a central marketing point . The usual practice is for three men to handle
