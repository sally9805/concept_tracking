........... ..........  | On a Sunday in August a bolt of lightning struck the beach at Riis Park , New York , killing three bathers and stunning fourteen others . Exactly one year later to the day and within twenty minutes of the time , another lightning bolt struck not two hundred feet from the scene of the first accident , killing three more bathers and injuring fifteen . This coincidence does more than prick the old legend about lightning not striking twice : it emphasizes an elementary fact , which a lot of people on that beach apparently did not know ? the worst place to be when lightning is striking close by is out in the open . Since the peak of the lightning season happens also to be the peak of the vacation season , when the greatest number of people are likely to be outdoors , this is a good point to keep in mind . Ignorance of it is largely responsible for the fact that hardly a summer goes by without several golfers and fishermen being struck by lightning . Not so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ; but because , like the bathers at Rockaway , they happened to be the highest points in the lightning field , hence the most attractive targets . You know that lightning is " striking close " when the flash and the thunder peal are almost simultaneous . That 's the time to brush up on your prayers ! And you should remember that " out in the open " includes standing under a solitary tree and seeking refuge in an isolated , frame building , no matter how small . Lightning frightens more people and kills fewer than any other common hazard . Fatalities from this cause seldom exceed four hundred a year , nine-tenths of them in rural areas . Statistically this is small potatoes compared with the 16,000 who die annually from falling down at home ! Yet this does n't alter the fact that lightning is no toy : it costs the public plenty in damages despite elaborate protection ; it destroys around $20,000,000 worth of farm property a year plus thousands of head of cattle killed in the fields . A single stroke caused $100,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few years ago . So , while lightning hardly justifies the rabid fear professed by some people , it certainly merits respect and sensible precautions . Should you be caught by a storm in open country , your best havens would be a cave , a ravine or gully , a patch of woods , the denser the better . Give wire fences a wide berth ; get off high ground if possible . And when the thunder ceases to rumble but comes in sharp , ringing cracks that jolt your teeth , forget you 're a respectable member of the human race and throw yourself down flat . The safest places are properly rodded buildings , metal structures , and buildings of steel-frame construction . Such places a struck frequently but rarely damaged , since the charge is conveyed harmlessly to the ground . Lightning 's penchant for chimneys ( the highest point on the house )  | emphasizes the prudence of staying out of the line of fireplaces and stoves during a severe storm . For although a bolt may come down the chimney , it is likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms , and it is n't healthy to be in the way . By the same token , lightning often follows plumbing or electrical systems through a house ; hence the bathtub is not a very good spot to be caught in . It is advisable also to refrain from using the telephone if the outside wires are overhead . A safe place in an average home is the middle of a metal bed pulled out from the wall . There is no basis for the popular beliefs that open doors or windows " draw in " lightning with the draft and that holding a knife , scissors , or similar metal objects constitutes a hazard . If a bolt is coming in , it 'll come whether the doors and windows are open or closed . And while it will jump readily for some large metallic body , such as a stove , -a small object like a pair of scissors ca n't hope to offer much attraction to such a big-league spark . The people Grandma used to tell about who were struck with scissors in their hands would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the discharge . Truly , Nature 's blitz is no toy ; but it does submit to reasonable precautions . And although it scares lots of people half out of their skins , it actually kills only one-fortieth as many as die from falling downstairs or tripping over rugs !
