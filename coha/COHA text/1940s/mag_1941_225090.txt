Gunner 's Mate Walter Sorensen of the Reuben James sat down and scrawled what was perhaps to be his last letter : <P> " Dear Sis , " he wrote , " ... I think we will make another trip to Iceland before we go to the Navy Yards . I sure hope I can come home on leave even if it is only for a few days . . . . We sure do n't get much time in any more . . . . We are here only until Thursday morning and then back to Portland . From there I do n't know . . . . " <P> From there the Reuben James picked up a convoy and worked up toward where it was chilly . Walter Sorensen did not know where she was bound : some of the guys said probably Russia ; others said no , just Iceland again . <P> On the way there was the usual routine for Walter Sorensen : cleaning the breech-blocks and oiling the six 3-inch A.A.s , checking the trip-mechanisms for the ash cans ( depth charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the boys said , " stiff with subs " ) . It was hard work . The whole crew had been ordered onto Condition Baker-watch and watch , four hours on and four off . <P> Still , there was time in the watches below to cork off and think about what it 's like to be in the U.S.N. <P> For Walter Sorensen , 19 years old , six feet tall , yellow-haired and hopeful , it was good fun . It had not always been . He went into the Navy at 17-two years ago - just to get away from the tired smallness of his father 's farm on the outskirts of Omaha . But the Great Lakes Naval Training Station had been grim : the inoculations made him sick , being away from home did too . <P> Later he started moving , and that was better-Key West , Costa Rica , the Virgin Islands . Sorensen studied , took some exams , got two promotions . Within a year and a half he was hauling down $62 a month . <P> They put him on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crack-erboxes that were finished too late for the other war ; she was two years older than he , and shrewish in a choppy sea . But he got to like her , learned to refer to her as Rube and developed a heap of respect for the commanding officer , Lieut . Commander Heywood L. Edwards . That name Heywood did not mean a thing : it was better to call him Tex and pay heed to his calm voice : he was six feet two and used to be an Olympic wrestler . <P> Walter Sorensen heard the story of the original Reuben James . They said he was born in Delaware in the big year , 1776 . He went to sea just like anybody and got to be a bosun 's mate . In the fighting against the pirates of Tripoli in 1804 , he did his big deed . There was a fierce hand-to-hand fight one day . James 's boss , Captain Stephen Decatur , was knocked down by a Tripolitan . Another pirate lifted his scimitar to kill the Captain . James dived and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Decatur said if he would only recover , Reuben James could have anything he wanted . Decatur expected his bosun 's mate to ask to be an officer . <P> Said the original Rube : " Please , sir , I do n't want to have to roll up my hammock in the mornings ever again . " He recovered , never rolled his hammock.
