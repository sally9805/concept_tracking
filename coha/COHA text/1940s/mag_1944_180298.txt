After two seasons of soggy , reclaimed-rubber " victory balls , " tennis players will get a new bounce this year . Balls are being made of synthetic rubber , and there will be plenty of them . <P> Not quite so lively as prewar balls of natural rubber , synthetics are far peppier than balls made of reclaimed rubber . Each ball contains 8/10 oz. of buna , sells for the usual 50 . Dunlop , Spalding , Voit and Pennsylvania ( who make all U.S. tennis balls , under their own and others ' names ) are all in production , with pioneering Pennsylvania already popping out 16,000 a day . <P> Synthetics meet all specifications of the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association . It calls them " a tremendous improvement , " but not the equal of prewar balls . Players who have tried them add another caution : like all tennis balls before them , these have the same tendency to go out or in the net .                  @ @ @
