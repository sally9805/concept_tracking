In San Francisco high schools , one of the most popular extracurricular activities is contract bridge . Last year parents of students at Marina Junior High School got up a petition and persuaded School Superintendent Joseph P. Nourse , against his better judgment , to give bridge official standing : as an " experiment , " Marina pupils were permitted to form a bridge club , spend one school period a week in practical study of their subject . The bridge club shortly became the biggest in the school . <P> Last week Superintendent Nourse , decreeing that " the common playing card " was not an educational material , unceremoniously ended the experiment . His decree threw San Francisco 's school system into a furor . Indignant parents formed a committee , circulated petitions , marched to Mr. Nourse 's office and demanded that contract bridge be made a part of the curriculum . Besides teaching youngsters 1 ) citizenship , 2 ) mathematics , 3 ) how to think , they declared that contract bridge was necessary to their children 's vocational training .
