txt Western Germany is suffering a recurrence of inflation fever , and doctors are debating the next " cure . " riair a year ago , occupation authorities introduced a sharply curtailed supply of new currency to replace an enormous bulk of almost valueless Relchsmarks . Many old marks were completely frozen : the rest exchanged at about 10 old to one new As a corollary to this drastic reform the German economic administrator . Ludwig Erhard. launched a " free-enterprise " experiment , relieving most goods from rationing and even more from price control . Non-Russian Germany was promptly jolted into a state of semi-prosperity . Goods came out of hiding and production spurted . Observers labeled the reform a thumping success . Americans had cause to hope so . Downand-out Germans are on the dole of the Ti . S. treasury . Things look far less promising now . Prices have again soared way out of reach of the average family 's income . For example . an ordinary set of china for 12 persons . which cost 145 Deutschemark x$43.501 at the official rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than twice that sum Some articles of furniture have risen 70% in price during the period . Shoes are one-third higher . Save Goods . Not Money Hoarding is once again widespread , reflecting a lack of confidence in the present currency and anticipation of even higher prices . Says a Frankfurt retailer : " My house furnishings supplier admits he sells only enough of his output to pay wages and operating expenses . The rest he puts aside . " Savings of money are almost non-existent . Commodity-starved Germans are strictly consumption-minded . Even so . most goods are so far out of the average income range that many people arc ? doing extra work to get extra money . A small furniture manufacturer tells about leaving his factory for a few hours . He returned unexpectedly to find all 50 of his workers busily making wooden sewing kits , to sell on their own . " I do n't blame them , the way things are how , " he says . " In the first weeks after currency reform you could say business was functioning normally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dollars Take the case of the west-German egg . Immediately after the monetary switch eggs were de-rationed ; they were plentiful at 30 pfennlg ( nine Ti S. centsi apiece . Now rationed again , an egg is hard to find at the equivalent of 45 cents on the black market . The black market is back in full force . American cigarettes , at about , 250 north of marks for a pack , cost approximately what they did before the drastic currency swap . The same is true of the black market In American dollars , a good rough index of currency 's real worth . At DM 19 to $1 on the black market ( legal rate : DM 3 1-3 to $1i the new German currency is worth no more . in terms of illicit dollar exchange , than was the old one . To avoid paying taxes they regard as " confiscatory . " German businesAmen are resorting to a " pocketbook economy " without ben efit of private records or bank accounts . Those accounts that are kept are often juggled . One American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total money volume may now be involved in illegal transactions . Some responsible f .. " iermans put the figure as high as 40% to 50Ci . What 's Wrong ? What has gone wrong with the great currency reform that was supposed to accomplish so much ? Explanations vary , but there is fairly general agreement among Allied and German financial circles on one major cause : there is still too much money in circulation . In contrast to the German currency reform of 1923 , when an initial advance of 1,200 million Rentenmark was issued , the action of mid-1948 provided for a series of advances . The " head quota " ( advance to individuals ) alone accounted for DM 3 billion . To industry went 600 million ; to displaced persons , 100 million ; to public officials . 2 billion ; to military government , 500 million . " Perhaps there was a slight miscalculation . " says a prominent German banker . " It was assumed people would save , but they did n't and it does n't scorn they will . The result is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active . " Return to Full Regulation Already there are loud voices demanding a return to governmental price control , with all the paraphernalia of a more regimented economy . Labor and farmers are leading the clamor against the free-enterprise experiment launched by economic administrator Erhard . Under this system of partial freedom , basic foods are still rationed at controlled prices . Also rationed , but free of price control , are shoes and clothing . Most other items are unrationed and uncontrolled . Farmers . in particular , have a telling argument : They say they sell their products at relatively low controlled prices , but have to buy many necessities at high free market prices . Germans of Erhard 's persuasion favor another modification of the entirely free market as an approach to the high-price problem . commodities at dow prices for mass consumption . The " Everyman " idea is that if enough goods appear on the market at reasonable prices , the general price level will drop . The " Everyman " scheme is supposed to work this way : the bizonal economic administration in collaboration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those businessmen willing to cooperate  --  the program is entirely voluntary  --  a certain proportion of raw materials imported by the official Joint Export-Import Agency ( J.E.1.A. : are assigned . Wool goes to suit manufacturers , hides to shoe makers and so on . Manufacturers outside the program are hard put to get adequate supplies of essential raw materials . This Jedermann plan has already run into snags . Decartelization authorities have jumped on the scheme , claiming trade associations act like cartels in fixing retail prices . Their objections were partly met by setting price ranges instead of exact prices so that selling prices of both producers and retailers could vary . Affair of Herr Mueller One Alfons Mueller , big clothing manufacturer near Cologne , stirred up a fuss with a charge that his application for J.E.I.A. stocks had been turned down because his selling price was too low . The economic authoritv-s. after hullabaloo , agreed to make wool stocks available to efficient producers like Mueller . The textile industrial association , however , promptly vetoed that decision on the ground that resulting low prices would ruin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far Erhard intends to carry the " Everyman " scheme . His original idea apparently wits simply to set an example , using only 5% available wool for the scheme . Later he stated that as much as 80% would be alloted under the program , but the amount actually reaching the industry so far is roughly the original 5% . Many skeptics doubt if a sample program could exert any widespread downward influence on prices . Certainly the few Jedermann textiles to reach the market have had little appreciable effect on the sky-high cost of men 's suits . Jedermann shoes , on the other hand , have made much more of a splash . About 60% of imported hides are currently going to the program for a monthly production of about 1,300.000 pairs . Supporters of the scheme claim the general shoe price level has dropped as much as 20% since Jedermann shoes hit the market . Although shoes and clothes are at present the most important " Everyman " goods . china , kitchenware and bicycles are also being produced under the set-up . and the prugrarn is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Financial " Cures " Other economic doctors , doubting Jedermann will solve western Germany 's inflation woes , suggest financial remedies . They fever tighter bank credit and tax reform . The Bank Deutscher Lender , central bank and bank of issue for Bizonia , has recently restricted bankers ' acceptances , increased reserve requirements against demand deposits from 10% to 13% and requested all credit institutions not to increase their ci edit volume over that outstanding on October 31 . The board of directors of the hank is currently considering raising the rediscount rat* . The present tax law , say German businessmen . works to destroy initiative and encourage evasion and illegal -pocketbookbusiness . For instance , they observe . the . three directors of an enterprise worth S13 million make , after income and property taxes , not much more than $600 a year each . Besides income and property tax reform , both Allied and German economists urge luxury and consumption taxes to take money out of circulation and discourage " consumption-mania . " Some argue that the toughest problem facing the area 's shaky economy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-existent : somehow , saving has to he stimulated . Allied officials hope that in spite of a high tax rate , special inducements for saving and re-investment will do the trick . If it does n't , they fear some kind of compulsory saving may be " unavoidable . "
