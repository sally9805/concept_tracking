Although the Chinese thought they should be getting a lot more help from their allies , they gave Wendell Willkie the biggest reception yet . It was bigger than Jawaharlal Nehru got in 1939 , than Lauchlin Currie got in 1941 . Even the Japanese contributed : Japanese scouting planes , looking for Willkie , nosed toward Chungking for three days running , but ran into fog before they reached the capital . <P> Chungking made itself ready . The Official guest bungalow , bright as its rhododendrons , was equipped with a powerful radio , a cook who could range from ham &; eggs to Szechwan duck , and-another great luxury for China-soft toilet paper . But Wendell Willkie would only have to look out of his windows to see the great ridges packed with colorless shacks where Chungking 's hundreds of thousands were enduring their sixth year of war . <P> After three days in outlying Chinese cities , Willkie arrived at Chungking 's suburban airport in a Douglas piloted by Baltimore-born Moon Chen , first man to complete a flight across the Himalayas . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. ( " Daddy " ) Rung , U.S. Ambassador Clarence Edward Gauss and gallant Lieut . General Joseph ( " Uncle Joe " ) Stilwell . <P> Willkie looked excited but very tired , as he had on his Moscow arrival ( TIME , Oct. 5 ) . The brass band was sour as it started the Star-Spangled Banner , but soon improved and was fine in the Chinese anthem . In the airport rest house Willkie said the right thing : " One of the difficulties facing me is that one falls so much in love with the Chinese people that it is difficult to form a critical and fact-finding judgment . " According to Chinese custom , he was given a hot towel with which to refresh his hands . <P> Then the heavy program began . Willkie was driven through Chungking 's crowded , cheering streets . He visited a meeting of the Chinese Cabinet , which was tussling with the inflation problem . He talked with China 's Chief of Staff General Ho Ying-chin . He talked with the Gissimo through the fluently translating Missimo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese-French cuisine including poisson du Yangtze au bain Marie and champignons du Fukien la volaille . Willkie tried chopsticks , but quickly fell back on knife &; fork . <P> It was obvious that the Chinese , like the Russians , enjoyed Wendell Willkie . And he would obviously be a great warmer of the lukewarm Sino-Allied relations - if he had brought with him enough assurances of material help . Just what he had brought was a military secret . But in Chungking , as in Moscow , Wendell Willkie loudly called for greater United Nations action . At the Gissimo 's banquet he said : <P> " I have learned that the ordinary citizen , from Cairo to Moscow to Chungking , is a lover of liberty and wants action-action now . He is ahead of his leaders , this plain citizen of Africa , or Europe , or Asia , or America . It annoys him that much of the might of the United Nations stands idle , awaiting action on some future day . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
