Although it was a little magazine in 1872 , it got a big reception . In pulpit and press , the newborn Popular Science Monthly was denounced as the devilish work of atheists and evolutionists . But blind Editor Edward Livingston Youmans , no atheist but a devout missionary from the world of science to the world of laymen , took the abuse in stride . " The work of creating science , " he wrote in Vol . I , No. 1 , " has been organized for centuries . . . . The work of diffusing science ... is clearly the next great task of civilization . " <P> As editor of International Scientific Series , Youmans had talked Herbert Spencer into writing a book for him . Excited by The Study of Sociology that Spencer sent him , he talked the Appletons into starting the magazine so as to run Spencer 's book serially . Two years later Spencer wrote him : " I think you ought to be satisfied if ... you have reached a circulation of 12,000 . ... I am rather inclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more popular . " <P> Last week , on its 75th Birthday , Popular Science was hardly as intellectual as in Youmans ' day , but it was much ( circ. 1,000,000 ) more popular . Its 288-page anniversary issue proudly called the roll of such contributors as Henry George , Charles Darwin , William James , Havelock Ellis , John Dewey , Thomas A. Edison , Charles Kettering . By shrewdly aiming at the home mechanic who yearns for a speaking acquaintance with atomic physics , and the scientist who yearns for a handcraft hobby , PSM had become the giant in its oddly assorted field . <P> Like most of the others ( Popular Mechanics , Scientific American , Mechanix Illustrated , Science Illustrated , etc. ) , it was still a men 's magazine : 99% of its readers are males from 18 to 60 . Its crowded advertising pages were cluttered , as they have been for years , with opportunity ads ( Get into Radio , Learn Massage at Home , etc. ) and bulging with the biceps of the bodybuilders . But editorially PSM had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Perry Githens . Githens had sharpened the magazine 's words- &-pictures; technique , shoved the gadget and how-to-do-it sections toward the back of the book . Says Githens : " Science is now everybody 's business . We 're not as lofty as the long-hair journals , but we 're a lot more readable . "
