THE EMPEROR 'S SNUFF BOX-John Dickson Carr-Harper ( $2 ) . How a harassed and suggestible young Englishwoman was saved from almost certain conviction as the slayer of her fiance 's father by the supershrewd deductions of Dr. Kinross , specialist in criminal psychology . A brilliant exercise in detecting , a chilling adventure in careful , cold-blooded villainy , a sterling bit of craftsmanship even though one important bit of evidence is held back . <P> THE FOURTEENTH TRUMP-Judson P. Philips- Dodd . Mead ( $2 ) . The tough and tricky tale of a Manhattan hotel-room murder that puts a pretty girl in the shadow of the chair , leads Broadway Gambler Danny Coyle and his Harvard-graduate assistant through a dexterously crooked bridge club to a shoot-it-out finish . Credible tough-guy stuff , well packed with excitement . <P> CUE FOR MURDER-Helen McCoy- Morrow ( $2 ) . The actor who portrayed a dying man in a Manhattan revival of Sar-dou 's Fedora turns out to be very dead indeed when the curtain goes down . Psychiatrist-detective Basil Willing , working on tenuous clues and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and excellently hidden criminal in a trap that almost ends the doctor 's own career . Credible stage atmosphere and an airtight plot . <P> THE MOVING FINGER-Agatha Christie - Dodd , Mead ( $2 ) . Grey-haired Miss Marple , whose innocent face conceals a good deal of criminal knowledge and detecting skill , stops her knitting long enough to present the puzzled police with the solution of a poison-pen plot that leads to suicide and murder . A smoothly flowing and flawlessly constructed story . <P> MOTHER FINDS A BODY-Gypsy Rose Lee-Simon &; Schuster ( $2 ) . The ribald and revealing antics of a bunch of traveling burleycuers on the Texas border , and what they did about a couple of unwanted corpses that turned up in their trailer . Has its points as a detective story and its moments of truth as a chronicle of life among strippers , tassel-tossers and the like ; also a few amusingly snide remarks . But the show-stuff pretty much follows the party line laid down in The G-String Murders .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
