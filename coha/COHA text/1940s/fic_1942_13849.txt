ASPACIOUS basement room on O'Farrell Street in San Francisco , with steps coming down . Early evening . Along the wall are a variety of objects : a punching-bag , a merry-go-round horse on rockers , a highly polished brass cuspidor near the punching bag . At a table is THE TIGER , a man of thirty . Opposite him is THE CROW , a Mexican boy of seventeen , who is strumming on a guitar . At the punching bag , in green boxing trunks , is BLACKSTONE BOULEVARD , a tall colored boy of twenty-two who is chewing tobacco . Watching him is PAUL , a small boy . Every once in a while BLACKSTONE BOULEVARD spits enormously into the cuspidor , listens a moment , and then begins to shuffle near the punching-bag , his arms out . After a minute of strumming the Mexican boy stops . THE CROW ( Whispering ) Somebody 's coming ! THE TIGER ( Easily ) You must stop being afraid , Little Crow . Play the guitar . I must have good things to hear . BLACKSTONE BOULEVARD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( He punches ) Tiger , how do you like that ?

Land and horses and lots of women . Oh , I can feel it in my bones . A proud , lazy , drinking man . A shouting man , hollering across the fields with liquor on his breath . Work , you black men !

But now I 'm twenty-two again . p. 5 THE TIGER ( To THE CROW ) What 's he look like ? BLACKSTONE BOULEVARD Tell The Tiger about me , Little Crow . Tell him what you see . THE TIGER No . Wait . Not yet . I 'll see you soon . And then I 'll tell The Crow and he can tell me if I 'm right or wrong . Where 's the boy ?

After a moment the boy smiles ) THE TIGER Now he 's smiling . BLACKSTONE BOULEVARD He 's smiling now all right . THE TIGER Put him on the horse . ( BLACKSTONE takes the boy to the rocking-horse . The boy turns toward THE TIGER ) p. 6 BLACKSTONE BOULEVARD Get on the horse , boy . Get on the horse . ( Shouting ) Can you hear me ? ( The boy smiles and gets on the horse ) That 's right . He ca n't hear a word . ( The boy rocks on the horse , whistling softly ) Can you hear me , boy ? ( Shouting ) What 's your name ? ( He waits , spitting . The boy smiles ) He 's stone deaf .

THE BOY ( Bitterly , proudly ) I ran away . They wo n't catch me . I ran away in the night . Everybody came after me , but I did n't cry . BLACKSTONE BOULEVARD ( Excited , shouting ) Can you hear me , boy ? Where 's your father ? p. 8 THE TIGER ( Gently ) Blackstone . Blackstone Boulevard .

BLACKSTONE BOULEVARD One hundred and ninety-three , Tiger . One hundred and ninety-three pounds , according to the penny scale . The number is printed on a little card . On the card it says , You are honest and kind . ( Shouting ) Can you hear me , boy ? The card says , You are honest and kind , but  --  ( He stops ) Is the message on the card true ? Is it for me , Tiger ? THE TIGER Maybe . What 's the rest of the message ? BLACKSTONE BOULEVARD The card says , You are honest and kind , but  --  Maybe it ai n't for me , Tiger . Maybe they meant the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know was how much I weigh . Maybe it ai n't true . p. 10 THE TIGER Maybe . What 's it say ? BLACKSTONE BOULEVARD ( Slowly ) You are honest and kind , it says , but you will always have trouble with people who are not like yourself . That 's what it says , Tiger . I been saying it over in my mind all the time since yesterday . THE TIGER It 's probably not true . Hit the bag and be the deaf boy 's brother . BLACKSTONE BOULEVARD Oh , I 'll do them things , Tiger . I 'll hit the bag and I 'll be his brother , but I 'm black and the world is full of people who ai n't black . Is the card right , Tiger ?

THE TIGER Is it the wrong name ? THE CROW It 's right , I guess , but you gave it to me before you ever heard me sing . THE TIGER That was an accident . THE CROW If you 've been blind all your life , how can you tell what a tiger looks like , or a crow , or a man , or a woman , or a place , or anything ? THE TIGER I can tell . THE CROW But how ? THE TIGER Maybe what I see is a little wrong , maybe what everybody else sees is a little wrong . The crow is black , and cries out with regret . THE CROW How big is it ?

THE CROW No , but I 'd like to know why I have this one . THE TIGER You are a crow in a leafless winter tree . The tree is your guitar . p. 12 THE CROW Ca n't you see just a little ? I mean , with your eyes ? THE TIGER I see everything as swiftly as people with eyes , but I do n't trust that vision , so I wait , I keep blind , inside , as I am outside . I wait until I know I am seeing it true . THE CROW How do you know ? THE TIGER I guess and compare until I guess right , and the comparison is exact . Why do n't you sing ? THE CROW You want me to make up a song ? THE TIGER I think you might do that . ( THE CROW strums on the guitar a moment , and then begins to sing , slowly and thoughtfully ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man who is blindAnd can not see me.I can see the man but not the tiger .

THE TIGER ( Almost gently ) Where 's the boy ? BLACKSTONE BOULEVARD He 's right here . Standing right beside me . THE TIGER ( Loudly ) Crow ? ( The boy almost leaps . He takes the boy 's arm ) Take me through the streets . ( To BLACKSTONE ) Talk to the boy . And let him talk to you . Let him say everything he 's got to say . BLACKSTONE BOULEVARD I 'll talk to him , Tiger , and he 'll talk to me . THE CROW ( Wounded ) You told me to make up a song . I did n't know what kind of a song it would be .

Now , the flower  --  the greatest of them all . Strum it . Maggie ? Listen to it , so I may see you . MAGGIE I 'll listen . ( THE CROW strums , building a strange powerful theme , and playing for a long time as THE TIGER turns toward MAGGIE , finally getting up and touching her face gently . While the strumming continues , BLACKSTONE BOULEVARD comes in , still in his boxing trunks , but terribly beaten . He stands foolishly , with the boxing gloves pulling down his shoulders . Out of the gloves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Police , fire , and other sirens are heard , and soon FANCY DAN comes running into the room , as one who is chased .
