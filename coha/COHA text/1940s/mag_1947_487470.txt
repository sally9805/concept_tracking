WHEN Artur Rodzinski , conductor of New York 's Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra , which has a radio audience of 13,000,000 , threw down his baton in February of last year , thousands of concert artists and other musicians chuckled with satisfaction . They appreciated only too well the accuracy of his parting shot at the Philharmonic 's Board of Di  --  rectors : " Columbia Concerts , Inc. , a concert management agency of which Arthur Judson is president , is often more important than the New York Philharmonic Sym  --  phony , which is treated as a subsidiary on occasion . " The implication was , of course , that Arthur Judson , president of Columbia Concerts , the biggest agent for concert artists in this country , was in cahoots with Arthur Judson , manager of the New York Philharmonic Or  --  chestra , which engages more than twenty-five soloists a year . Young concerts artists , whose careers are launched or broken by Agent Judson or his chief rival , the Na  --  tional Concert Artists Corporation , hoped that Rod  --  zinski 's resignation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Philharmonic , touchstone of success for young soloists , but on the concert stage in general . Arthur Judson , once a violinist , long ago discarded his fiddle for a career of concert management . By effect  --  ing a merger of his agency with several of his competi  --  tors in 1930 and selling a half-interest to the Columbia Broadcasting System , he formed the largest concert-booking agency in the country . His CBS tie-up gave him the inside track to radio talent and radio time , enabling him to build up his stare reputations and box-office ap  --  peal . At about the same time National Concert Artists Corporation , an offshoot of the National Broadcasting Company , was organized to take similar advantage of radio-build-up possibilities . Now Columbia and NCAC control between them about 90 per cent of the long-hair musical talent in the country and are the sole suppliers of concert artists to more than a thousand American towns  --  most of the towns that ever see a live artist . Inevitably a young musician can have but meager hope of success unless he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big two . That is why the six hundred yearly graduates of the ranking Eastern music schools besiege these agencies for a place on their roster . Not more than six of the six hundred ever get a contract from one or the other of them , and these chosen few are not always the ' best qualified for a successful career behind the footlights . " Breaks " and an inexhaustible supply of cash are as important as talent . Imagine the plight of a talented young writer who knows that if his novel is turned down by two publish  --  ing houses , he will never see it published . Imagine a doctor who to make a living must be connected with one of two hospitals , a lawyer who must work through one of two firms . Suppose the theater had only two pro  --  ducers . A young actress would not unreasonably feel crushed if one of them turned her down , and she would feel still worse if she knew it was not because she lacked acting ability but because he already had as many young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the situation the young musician faces when he embarks on a concert career . THE trials of Jeanne Therrien , Juilliard ' 44 , are typi- cal of those of even the most promising young stars . Miss Therrien has studied the piano since she was five . In her twenty-odd years she has devoted about 40,000 hours to practicing and another 15,000 to the study of harmony , theory , counterpoint , score reading , and con  --  ducting . Each hour of practice , each lesson , each per  --  formance , was a step toward the crucial moment in her career , the New York debut : on this single performance hangs the young musician 's chance to pull down glow  --  ing notices from New York critics and thus attract the attention of a big manager . After her graduation from Juilliard , Jeanne won the Walter W. Naumburg Award , which gave her a recital with all expenses paid at New York 's Town Hall , and the Leventritt Award , which permitted her to appear at Carnegie Hall as soloist with the Philharmonic Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of the con  --  tests to capture both in one year . Her talent was recog  --  nized ; success seemed assured , Jeanne Therrien gave her two concerts in January and February , 1945 . The reviews called her " a brilliant young pianist born to go places . " Noel Straus of the New York Timer said she was " one of the big talents . " Willy Kapell , 1941 Naumburg winner , wrote that when he heard her playing a Rachmaninoff concerto with the Philharmonic over the radio he thought it was Horowitz . The next morning she confidently went to the office of the Columbia Concerts corporation expecting to walk December 20 , 1947 out with a - contract . Instead , she was told in effect : " There 's no question about it . You 're a top pianist . We are most impressed with your talent , with your perform  --  ances , with your notices . However , it is very difficult to sell a woman pianist . And besides we have too many young pianists on our list already . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It looked as if her professional career had died at birth . The managers of the two big agencies admit that not many youngsters get contracts as a result of New York debuts . Yet booking agents on the road insist that they can sell only artists with New York critics ' notices . They say that Denver , for example , wo n't pay to hear a pianist from Kansas City , nor , Dallas to hear a singer highly re  --  garded in Pittsburgh . So the most talented musician f ; om Kansas or Pennsylvania must go to New York and give a recital . That means that he must somehow scrape up the money to hire a manager who can arrange his recital , get out publicity , send tickets to newspaper critics , and so on . This year about 250 musicians will give recitals in New York 's concert halls , and each of these concerts will cost the performer up to $1,800 . Less than twenty-five of them will make expenses , let alone a profit . Usually the manager papers the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow the New York recital route . Once in a great while they hit the jackpot , like the re  --  markable Polish pianist , Maryla Jonas , whose enthusiastic reviews after her Carnegie Hall debut last year won her a Columbia contract , a solo performance with the Phil  --  harmonic , and a tour through the United States and South America during her first concert season . The ma  --  jority fall by the wayside for lack of funds or lack of courage and perseverance . " You must have iron guts to survive , " says one young artist who has been saving for three years to make her Town Hall debut . IF THE going is so rough , why do n't young artists go to smaller managers who have more time for them ? An ingenious plan known as the organized audience supplies the reason . This is how the plan works : Behind the imposing New York firm of Columbia Concerts is Community Concerts , a network of bookings stretching across the United States and Canada . A music salesman , pleasantly known at Columbia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Humbug , Nevada , Meets the town 's social leaders , and in practiced patter persuades them of the advantages of contracting for a Community Concerts series . He tells them that all they need to do is run a week 's subscription drive and then choose a group of artists on the basis of the amount of money collected . Towns that fall in with this plan find they can get the pick of the world 's concert artists without financial worry . Thus if a town raises $4,500 , it may choose one high-priced artist , a Heifetz for example , at Va. ) o0 , and four671 lesser artists at $250 a piece . It can not , however , raise $9,000 and get Pons , Rubinstein , and Menuhin . For this is a package business , and the package contains one prize piece , the expensive bonbon which sells it , and several fillers , wanted or not . The partnership between Columbia and Community went well from the start . Columbia supplied top names , capital , and a large booking staff already in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , NBC 's management organization , could hardly survive if it offered its artists less satisfactory national outlets ; so NCAC also organized a local chain , Civic Concerts . The independent concert managers now found the sled  --  ding tougher than ever . You might think that the package idea for subscrip  --  tion concerts , by requiring a number of lesser lights to be taken along with the tempting big names , would offer a splendid opportunity for young talent . It has given newcomers a chance to be heard , a chance to gain priceless experience . But at the same time by classing some artists as " big ? and others as " little " it has forced the develop  --  ment of rigid price levels . And this often proves fatal for young musicians . One twenty-four-year-old violinist , for example , got a contract with NCAC the day after his Town Hall debut . It was renewed each year until he went into the army in 1941 , with his manager 's last words ringing in his ears , " Let us know when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after his discharge last summer , the manager told him that his pre-war notices were too dated : " You 'll have to give a New York recital before we can put you back on our list , " he said . Unfortunately the young violinist had n't saved the nec  --  essary $1,000 from his G. I. pay . He could n't earn $1,000 except by giving concerts . He could n't give a concert without $1,000 . Oddly enough , he took his pre  --  dicament philosophically . " It 's a matter of business , " be said . " They want just so many artists at the various price levels , and there is n't room for another $250 violinist . " THE unknown young artist who gets a contract is still not on the path to glory when he starts off on the Community circuit . The standard routine for a " small " filler name is to play from ten to forty concerts a season in one of the eight " time blocks " into which Columbia has divided the country , and to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him to build up any sort of following , since he will not meet an audience a second time until eight years has passed . One of the leading American pianists summed up this com  --  plaint : " Repeat engagements are discouraged , " she said . " There is no effort to keep your memory warm in the towns you 've played , because you serve quite nicely just as you are  --  as filler to round out the list of big names at small cost to the community and to the management . For this service you take a reduced fee and pay a 15 per cent commission . " Playing the circuit with the anonymity of a circus down , the filler artist is lucky to keep as much as half of his total fee before taxes . The agent takes 15 or 20 per cent ; the rest goes for expenses . An NCAC violinist says , " I 'm lucky if I can keep 30 per cent after I 've paid railroad and hotel expenses for myself and my accom  --  panist , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Another NCAC artist wound up a twelve-concert tour with exactly $10 in take-home pay . One Naumburg winner , a sufficiently dis  --  tinguished musician to be listed in " Who 's Who , " spent six months touring as an accompanist , for which he was paid $80 a concert . All expenses except railroad tickets came out of his pocket . In the face of such conditions any young artist would turn to an independent manager if he could . But the in  --  dependent manager is up against the organized-audience system as against a brick wall . Though Columbia declares it never starts a concert course where a local manager is already operating successfully , last year it organized a Community series in a Middle Western town to-dis  --  cipline an independent there who was not providing Columbia talent with sufficient outlets . To the local manager 's complaints a Columbia representative replied , " You do n't want this talent . What are we going to do with it ? We have to sell it . " Another independent man  --  ager who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-six years met competition from NCAC 's Civic chain for the first time last year . Soon after the first Civic concert , subscribers to the in  --  dependent series telephoned to the manager to ask about a rumor that she was going out of business . After the first independent concert , a rumor circulated that sub  --  scriptions to the rest of the concerts were going to be canceled . The independent manager charged the local head of the Civic series with responsibility for the rumors . Finally she was forced to run a large newspaper ad to deny them . Such tactics may easily cause a local manager to fold up . C HOMILY before World War II the Federal Com  --  l. - ) munications Commission summoned Judson to Washington to explain some of the features of his busi  --  ness that might be construed as restraint of trade . The management companies moved quickly , however , and The NATION soon their booking organizations were formally divorced . from the parent broadcasting companies . The FCC was apparently satisfied , though many of the independent managers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuine reform . One of Rodzinski 's chief grievances was Judson 's re  --  fusal to give him a free hand in selecting guest con  --  ductors . Clearly , the retiring maestro felt that Judson 's management of some fifty symphony-orchestra conduc  --  tors had more influence on the choice of guest con  --  ductors for the Philharmonic than did the desires of its permanent leader . Aspiring concert artists who can not afford Rodzinski 's frankness have long believed that they would stand a better chance of obtaining the coveted solo engagements with the country 's twenty-four major symphony orchestras if fewer of these orchestras were under Judson-managed batons . In hundreds of letters and telegrams the music world applauded Rodzinski 's resignation  --  much as a Sunday School audience cheers David 's fight with Goliath . Among Rodzinski 's well-wishers was Henry H. Reich-hold , millionaire backer and president of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra . " Congratulations on your forth  --  right and courageous stand for musical freedom and in  --  dependence , " wired at eichhold . Then in a bold opening maneuver he bought all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of New York , set up an artists ' bureau , and prepared to make standardized " pop " concerts avail  --  able to a thousand cities and towns at rock-bottom prices by developing orchestras of sixty or seventy musicians assembled under local management in various large cities . These orchestras will tour the towns and cities in their areas with solo artists provided from New York . Reichhold offers his artists the chance to build up a radio following by appearing with the Detroit Symphony on the Sunday Evening Hour , which he has leased for fifty-'two weeks . They can cut records with the Detroit Sym  --  phony for Vox Records , a Manhattan classical-record company which Reichhold acquired in January . Since he has already pulled out of the red two failing musical enterprises  --  the Detroit Symphony and the trade maga  --  zine Musical Digest  --  the musical world can scarcely ig  --  nore his entrance into the field of management . Reich-hold says : " I think you will see some present concert organizations breaking up . The time is ripe . " To people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a promise . The quality of the music Reichhold plans to circulate and his uncertain reputation as a disinterested musical benefactor do not insure his success as a full-fledged competitor to the big two . It is generally agreed , however , that the chemical manufac  --  turer 's  --  or another 's  --  millions are a prerequisite for breaking into the securely held territory of Columbia Concerts and NCAC.
