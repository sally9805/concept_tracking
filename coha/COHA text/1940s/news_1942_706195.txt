txt Donald M. Nelson , chairman of the new War Production Board , indicated to the Army , Navy and Office of Production Management today that comprehensive changes were likely in the government 's armaments production machine . Key purchasing and production agencies of the government were informed by Mr. Nelson that any organizational changes deemed necessary " to lick Hitler and the Japs " would be made , and he set his goal as production of enough war weapons to assure defeat of the Axis powers " in the shortest possible time . " The new production chief , who , President Roosevelt said yesterday , is to make final decisions on pro curepient and production , transmitted identical retters to William S. Knudsen , OPM. director ; James V. Forrestal , Under-Secretary of the Navy , and Robert P. Patterson , Under-Secretary of War . The letters read : " We have just one job to do ? to make enough war materials to lick Hitler and the Japs , and to do it in the shortest possible time . " Any organizational changes that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made . The present organization must and will evolve into the most effective possible instrument to do it . " Every one connected with production and procurement , in all agencies of the government , must carry on with the utmost devotion and energy . " Combats Duplicated Effort One of the chief criticisms , both from critics and supporters of the Administration , has been that there has been too much duplication in direction of the defense program and that one " over-all " agency has been pyramided upon the previous one . In some cases , it has been asserted , the activities of agencies of equal rank have overlapped causing confusion and consequent delay . Mr. Nelson 's statement was widely interpreted as meaning that it was his intention to correct this situation and , as far as possible , simplify the Federal defense setup . The Executive order defining Mr. Nelson 's legal powers was not published today . Stephen Early , White House secretary , said that it was being drafted , but that its issuance was being delayed so that it would " conform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was considerable speculation regarding likely establishment of a " supreme Allied war supply council " and as to who would head it and who would represent the United States . There was keen interest in London reports that Lord Beaverbrook , British Minister of Supply , might stay in this country . Until the Executive order is issued , there will continue to be some doubt in the capital as to whether Mr. Nelson merely is to act as Executive officer for the President or is to take full authority for direction of the defense program , with the President to have merely ultimate authority . This was reflected in Congress today , where Senator Connally , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , and Senator Wiley , Republican of Wisconsin , urged that Mr. Nelson be given " complete authority " over the production of armaments . Senator Connally , tailing the floor after Senator Wiley asked that there be " no buck-passing spree " in the war effort , praised Mr. Nelson as " the strongest man " in the Federal defense organization . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Connally declared . He suggested that the appointment of the former merchandising executive would bring about a production speefi-up , after Senator Wiley stated that another sixty days should be allowed to determine whether this nation is going a get an adequate output of war goods . Senator Wiley said that there will be time enough to fix the blame for past lack of production when the Axis is defeated , and asserted that what the United States needs now is " results . " Senator Vandenberg , Michigan Republican , asked how unity could be expected " when the President and Secretary of Agriculture go in ! different directions , " a reference to a current dispute over price-control legislation . " The answer to that , " Mr. Wiley replied , " is that if they travel long enough in opposite directions they will get together . " Mr. Nelson , he added , " would be just another stool pigeon " if at his new job " he is required to spend all his time accounting for his actions . "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
