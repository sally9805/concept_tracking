THE castled Rhine Valley of song and legend , of Heine 's Lorelei and Wagners Per Ring des Nibelungen , today is a desolate land of rubble piles which yesterday were great cities , of highways strewn with the bloodstained , rain-soaked debris of fleeing armies , of scared and sullen people whose brief opium dream of world empire has burst like a land mine under a tank . Such cities as Aachen , Diiren , Cologne , and Koblenz essentially have ceased to exist ( map , page 4 ) . They must be rebuilt almost entirely to be habitable again , for today large areas , including their principal business and residential sections , are flattened deserts of stone and plaster strewn with rags , wastepaper , and fragments of furniture . Whenever the wind blows , these ruins are veiled in clouds of dust . In the cold spring rains they present a picture of dire and dreary desolation . Often in western Europe 's troubled history conquering armies have marched , both eastward and westward , over the low , sprucecovered Eifel and Hunsriick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bringing with them tragedy and destruction. * But the effects have been relatively mild in the past . for no hostile troops hitherto had crossed the area since the start of the Machine Age , with its ever more terrible weapons of annihilation . The Rhineland escaped very lightly in the last war . It was not entered by the Allies until after the armistice , and the military occupation of the country was exceptionally mild . There was no devastation . Contacts between the Rhinelanders and American , British , and French soldiers were , on the whole , friendly . About the only inconvenience suffered by the natives was that of providing billets in their homes for the occupation forces . Soldiers fell in love with the land . It is one of the most beautiful countries on earth , especially in spring with orchards in bloom , vineyards turning green on terraced hills and river banks , and forests whose great trees are in almost perfectly straight lines , without any undergrowth . They are like cathedral aisles . They are filled with the organ tones of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the leafy floor is like light through stained-glass windows . Almost every American soldier who spent a few months there has felt a nostalgic longing sooner or later to go back . War Plays Tricks of a Tornado But far different is the picture today from anything the soldier of 1918 would remember . The greatest war tornado in all history has swept the land . War , in fact , plays all the queer tricks of a tornado . It literally wipes one town from the face of the earth , while the town five miles away escapes nearly untouched . I have just been through the greater part of the Rhineland campaign with the United States ' First Army , to which fell the job of conquering the greater part of this area and establishing the first bridgehead across the Rhine which eliminated Germany 's last good natural line of defense . During the past three years of war I have seen many bomb- and shell-ruined cities . There was a constantly rising curve of destruction . We used to look with horror on the devastation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign of 1943 . Day after day it was pounded by American and British medium bombers . When troops of the U. S. 60th Infantry finally entered the city , there was hardly a habitable house left and only a few hundred citizens remained . We wondered how anyone could have stayed alive under the bombing , to the intensity of which the ruined blocks gave terrible evidence . The Army moved on to Sicily and found that the destruction of Bizerte was relatively mild compared to the rains of ruin from the skies which had flattened the harbor districts of Palermo and Messina . We passed on to France , and the devastation in Sicily seemed mild in turn compared to that of a few towns in Normandy . The worst example was the once lovely and prosperous market town and railroad center , St. L6 . Here was a town which was little short of pulverized . It was not rubble . It was dust . Probably for all time it will remain the outstanding example of how thoroughly bombs from the sky and thousands of tons of shells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But while passing through town after town in the Rhineland in the last few weeks , we remarked , over and over again , This is almost as bad as St. L6 . " Sometimes , because of the dismal rainy weather , it looked even worse . Not that the Allied Armies followed any deliberate policy of destruction . Quite the contrary . They withheld artillery fire , sometimes to their own disadvantage and against their better judgment , to spare historic shrines . Bombardiers were thoroughly briefed before starting on their missions on spot which , if possible , should not be hit . Rhinelanders Sullen , Bewildered But war is war . These towns and cities resisted often foolishly and hopelessly . Destruction was the only alternative to losing lives of Allied soldiers in clearing the way to the Rhine . The Allied soldier of 1918-19 would hardly recognize the Rhinelanders today . Then they were a rather pleasantly ingratiating folk . Now the troops passing through get only looks of sullen hatred from the people on the sidewalks.  | The Rhinelanders are bewildered . Until a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Germany was winning the war . Such had been the effect of Goebbels ' propaganda on the average citizen ( page 10 ) . Suddenly they heard of Allied tanks only a few miles away , and a few moments later the tanks were rumbling and belching fire through their streets . But they also are mad ? mad at Hitler , mad at the Allies , mad at everybody in the world except themselves . There are , of course , exceptions ? doubtless lots of exceptions . In nearly every town it has been possible to find some responsible citizens willing to cooperate . There has been from the first a strict ban on any fraternization between the populace and the Allied soldiers . Fines ranging from S50 to $125 have been imposed for engaging in casual conversations with Rhinelanders ; so the soldier has not had much opportunity to judge his unwilling hosts except from necessarily superficial observations . These have not been favorable. * Apparently , aside from the disruption of life due to bombing , the Rhinelanders suffered few hardships during the war . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wines and liquors have been uncovered in almost every town . In one small city an American division found itself in unexpected possession of 250 , - 000 bottles of high-quality champagne , presumably brought from France by German troops . There also were about 50 hogsheads of cognac . Because of strict antilooting orders sternly enforced , the supply was left untouched . But messes notably improved after entering Germany , because we overran German Army food dumps . Contrasts in Belgian Welcome The First Army 's advance from the western border of the Reich to the Rhine started on September 11 , 1944 , when , late in the afternoon , spearheads crossed the Luxembourg line north of Trier . Within 24 hours another group crossed the Belgian line on September 12 , near the small town of Rotgen ( page 13 ) . With a couple of minor exceptions , these soldiers became the first enemy troops to step on western German soil for more than a century ? that is , under actual war conditions .  | The armistice had been signed several days when the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon remained fairly typical , except that Rotgen was undamaged . The town was deserted . A white sheet or tablecloth was hung from an upper window of nearly every house , in token of surrender . The people had fled to the woods . Within the next two days they began drifting back ; led by Rotgen 's one policeman in full uniform , riding a bicycle . They were stunned into a sort of apathy , so rapid and unexpected had been the armored dash across Belgium . Actually the American soldiers had had their first taste of the civilian reaction they were likely to receive in Germany the evening before , when they had entered the Belgian border town of Eupen . This had been a part of the Reich until the last war , when it was awarded to Belgium . When the Nazi forces crossed the border in 1940 , the district immediately had been incor porated in the Rhineland again . The German element of the population , actually in the minority , had been in the saddle for four years . The Belgians either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . The armored division which I accompanied had swept northward on the tail of the disorganized German Army with unexpected speed . We had stopped the night before at Verviers . There the Americans had received the wildest reception of the whole war . The y had been pelted with fruit and flowers , their uniforms were soaked with wine , their faces were scarlet with lipsticked kisses from thousands of joy-frenzied women . It had been the climax of the whole progress across Belgium ( p. 3 ) . Eupen was only a few miles away , but the difference was dum founding . Here were no kisses , no flowers only silence , scowls , and sobs . The only cheers were for a German prisoner riding on the hood of one of our jeeps . A few days later the Belgians came out of hiding and the Germans went " underground . " Eupen proved as hospitable as any other Bel gian city . But to the American soldier , accus tomed to the role of liberator , the entry into Eupen was like a dash of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rhineland . Within a day they had punched holes through the great green dragon teeth and massive concrete pillboxes of the Siegfried Line . They moved eastward over hills blan keted with evergreens and through cathedral like forests to the real gate of the Rhineland and the Cologne plain which lay beyond , crossed by broad automobile highways leading straight into the northern Rhineland 's largest city . The tang of autumn was in the air . The hills were redolent with the odor of spruces , musical with the thunder of falling waters . We were in the Eifel mountains .  | In a few days the Ninth Infantry Division had taken possession of the gem of the countryside , the wonderfully picturesque little city of Monschau , without firing a shot . The town crier was going about the streets ringing his bell and calling out to the stunned people on the street corners the proclamations of the American Military Government ( page 28 ) . The First Division pressed toward Aachen . Part of the way they proceeded through one of the most magnificent forests in Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flickered stray sunbeams like silver threads . Three days after entering Germany , infantrymen were looking down from the hilltops on the roofs of Charlemagne 's ancient capital , above which rose the steeples of the churches . The next day they were in the outskirts of the city . Seen from a distance , Aachen appeared not badly damaged , although it had been the target of several air raids . Its walls stood erect , its roofs seemed intact . There was little evidence of resistance . The First Division drew up a surrender proclamation . There seemed little doubt that the terms would be accepted in a few days and the proud city which had once been the chief center of the Holy Roman Empire taken without the loss of American lives . Aachen Falls ? at a Price But Aachen chose to resist . More than a month of hard fighting followed before it was securely in American hands . We paid a high price in blood and agony . But Aachen paid a higher price . Today it is the corpse of a city , lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rains . Much of it is as flat as St. Lo . Most of the rest consists only of tottering walls . It is covered with wind-blown debris . It is doubtful that there is a single building intact .  | The rubble pile which was 2,000-year-old Aachen must be swept away by a fleet of bulldozers and the town rebuilt to be habitable again for any great number of people . It took the worst Allied air power and artillery could give . It is hard to see how it could have been spared anything it received . Next important city to fall in the progress eastward was Duren ( pages 11 , 16 ) . This town of 45,000 inhabitants and historic monuments , such as the Gothic St. Anna 's Church , was an even worse mess than Aachen when , after crushing air bombardments and cannon shelling , it finally was entered by the veteran Ninth Infantry Division . Here again is a corpse in the rain . It awaits bulldozers to bury it . Townspeople say there still are hundreds of unburied dead under the rubble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The way was open to the Rhine ? goal of the Allied Armies since the first landings in Normandy . Beside the swift-flowing Rhine just ahead lay the Rome of the North . Biggest and bestknown city of the Rhineland and one of the loveliest in Europe , holy place of European Christendom with its celebrated Cathedral and scores of spired churches , Cologne for months had been the immediate goal of the Allied Armies . During the first few days of March soldiers could look down from the hills to the west on Cologne 's rooftops . The final entrance was almost unopposed . Cologne " Had Had It " Nobody expected to find much more than a shambles . This important German war center , with about three-quarters of a million inhabitants , large industrial sections , and railroad marshaling yards , had sustained some of the heaviest air bombardments . In 1942 the RAF had showered it with destruction from the bomb pits of a thousand planes , first of the massive bombings which  | two years later were to become commonplace over German cities . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughly demolished . But strangely enough , since landmarks could not be distinguished by the bombardiers in the dark , the Cathedral remained uninjured . Air photos taken six months later showed that the city apparently had been almost entirely rebuilt . How much of this showing was deceptive , because of clever camouflage , nobody knows . But since then swarms of Allied bombers had visited the Rome of the North over and over again . Long since , there had been no major war industry left aboveground . Large completely flattened areas were shown . And this is exactly what the Third Armored Division found when its tanks rolled in over the crater-pocked streets . Cologne , as the soldiers say , " had had it . " It was about as badly smashed as Aachen . It is difficult to imagine how any city could be much more thoroughly smashed . Here is another job for the bulldozers ? to inter decently what once was one of the loveliest cities of Europe . But in the center of block after block of rubble still stands the great Cathedral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damaged . There are bomb holes , which have been bricked over , in its roof . All its windows are broken , its floor covered with debris . But the essential structure stands . The nearest parallel is St. Paul 's Cathedral in London , one of the few reasonably intact buildings in many blocks of flattened rubble . On D Day the Nazi Government declared the Cologne Cathedral " a historic monument . " This , of course , was a futile gesture . Obviously the structure was without military significance . No bombardier would deliberately have hit it in daylight . At night it would be impossible to distinguish it .  | The speciousness of the gesture was recognized by the Church authorities . The Archbishop , in the best tradition of his long line of princely predecessors , protested . He would prefer , he said , to see the sacred structure a heap of stone and plaster rather than allow it to be used as a cover for Nazi intrigue . The Sunday after the American Army entered the city reporters looked for him in vain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for American dead of the Eighth Division . A GI Plays Beethoven 's Piano Eerie through the after-midnight darkness , in which the thick mist was like a fine spray of ink , came clear piano notes of the " Moonlight Sonata . " In the ruins of a house on a wrecked street in Bonn some soldiers had sought shelter from German shells falling from across the river . They were awaiting the dawn to continue mopping up pockets of resistance in the shell-smashed old university city on the Rhine , which they had entered late the previous afternoon . The music startled these chilled , mistdrenched men . It was as if a ghost were playing . But they were not superstitious . The strains seemed to come from a little house across the street . They went over to investigate . In the flickering glimmers of their flashlights a gnomelike figure appeared before them . One leveled his rifle at it , but before he pressed the trigger he recognized the figure as a statue . The squad proceeded into the next room . There sat a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was one of their own comrades . In civilian life he had been a professional pianist . Wandering into this house , through whose roof a shell had fallen , he had found this piano and started to play in the dark ( page 14 ) . Not until next day did the soldiers find they had stumbled into the birthplace of Lud- wig van Beethoven , preserved as a shrine to the great composer and filled with Beethoven relics . The pianist-private had come upon what , presumably , was the composer 's own piano , on which , entirely unaware of the circumstances , he had played old Ludwig 's great composition ! Hitler Once Ejected from Liberal Bonn Except for the hole in the roof , the little house was not badly damaged . The relics remained intact , such of them as had been left by looters in the city 's own population , who had enjoyed a heyday as the Americans were entering and the Germans leaving the city . This was the first house placed under soldier guard when the American Military Government took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soul of Bonn . The spirit of the great composer still broods over the ruins . The destruction has been moderate compared to that at Aachen , Duren , or Cologne . Still , it is very considerable . Much of the center of the city in a rubble heap . A pathetic sight is the old university , a center of liberal tradition in Germany for centuries . At the start of the Nazi regime , students and faculty were openly rebellious . Even to the end , Bonn people say , a faint aura of liberalism lingered about the venerable institution , and the perverted psychology and racism of Nazidom were accepted with tongue in cheek . Citizens say that Hitler was thrown out of the city in 1933 , when he attempted to speak there. , and that he found refuge in near-by Bad Godesberg . The main university buildings are in the center of the city , near the city hall and the railroad station . They have been smashed badly , although not demolished . Every window is shattered . The more valuable books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cellar vaults , together with the largest accumulation of Rhine wines in the city . Military guards now protect the university from looters . Another historic landmark is the Munster ( Cathedral ) , which has two or three bomb holes in the roof and every window smashed . Floors were covered with debris of shattered stained glass , and cold rain was pouring on the roofless altar . When the Americans entered , more than a third of Bonn 's normal population of about 100,000 had fled . But 5,000 were found huddled in one lightless , airless , fetid air-raid shelter . They had lived there for at least three weeks . Only a few flickering candles broke the pitch-darkness . At least 5,000 other persons , we were told , were hiding in air-raid shelters and in cellars under the rubble , terrified of the bomb-shaken daylight . Near the center of the city , in a little park in front of the old Munster , stands a lifesized bronze statue of Beethoven . Two bombs recently landed in the park . There are two big fresh craters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass . The base of the statue is shattered . But the short , big-headed Beethoven overlooks the ruins uninjured , like a symbol of genius triumphant ? the immortal musician eternal in a crashing world . Far different is the picture four miles up the river at Bad Godesberg ( pages 8 , 9 ) . This celebrated health resort early in the war was turned into an enormous military hospital center . A third of the houses in town have red crosses on their roofs . These were respected . The city was spared by Allied bombers , and , when Lt. Col. Frank Gunn of the Ninth Infantry Division led his troops into the town after three days of hard fighting to reach it , he encountered no resistance . Instead , he was met by the Swiss consul , with a message from the German general in command offering to surrender the city ,  | together with himself and all his troops . Thus Bad Godesberg and the near-by watering place of Bad Neuenahr escaped the tornado of war . But Colonel Gunn felt considerable personal satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the luxurious RheinHotel Dreesen , that Chamberlain and Hitler met in September , 1938 , to discuss Czechoslovakia . This was prior to the Munich conference , from which the English Premier returned convinced that he had established " peace in our time . " The city was particularly favored by the Fuhrer . He came there often . He liked the great watering place as much as he disliked Bonn , citizens of the latter city say . Bad Godesberg had extended him hospitality in the days before his position was secure , when the university town had thrown him out . The proprietor of the Dreesen proudly showed a group of correspondents around the hotel , and we sat in the chairs of Hitler and Chamberlain . But it was risky , for snipers were shooting through the hotel windows from across the Rhine . A bullet pinged through the room . This was " peace in our time . " The Watch on the Rhine Fell Asleep A certain little Rhineland city has emerged from this campaign one of the historic places ) f the earth ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be memorizing this name a century hence . But the town has paid dearly for its immortality . Today it is nearly a total wreck , mostly because of German shellfire from the black volcanic hills across the Rhine and jetplane bombings . It was at this 2,000-year-old city that the watch on the Rhine fell asleep for a few moments , with the result that the broad , swift river which is Germany 's last great natural bulwark against invasion from the west became valueless ( page 18 ) . It is pure speculation , of course , but military experts of the First Army have estimated that at least 15,000 American lives were saved by the miracle of Remagen . The shabby little city of 5,000 leather tanners and wine makers , watched over by the locally famous church and monastery of St. Apollinaris on the gradually rising Viktoriaberg mountain , became the gateway to inner Germany , the country across the river which always has been Germany . Remagen owed its first place in the sun to a miracle nearly eight centuries ago . Even then it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later it was fortified by the Romans . The Roman period still shows in several ruined walls , a Roman gate , and a Roman road built A. D. 162 . But it was known chiefly as the shrine of St. Apollinaris . He was , according to the legend , one of the pupils of the Apostle Paul and was beheaded at Ravenna in Italy . The martyr 's followers obtained possession of his head and preserved it in a silver casket . In 1164 Frederick Barbarossa sent this sacred relic to his personal friend , the Archbishop of Cologne , for the Cologne Cathedral . The wanderings of the head between Rome and Remagen were complicated , but the final stage of the journey was by boat down the Mosel to Koblenz and then down the Rhine . At Remagen , as the legend is recounted by the Franciscan monks on the mountaintop , the boat stopped dead against the current and its prow turned toward the shore , despite the utmost efforts of the helmsman . This was considered a miracle . It was the Divine Will that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was erected as its shrine , and there the silver casket remains to this day . The monks showed it to many American soldiers during the first few days of the town 's occupation . The relic long was reputed to have miracleworking powers of healing . There was a considerable Apollinaris cult throughout the Rhineland for centuries , which brought to Remagen thousands of pilgrims each year . But for the past century the cult has been on the decline , the monks say , and they themselves now attach no special virtues to the relic . A new church was erected on the site of the pilgrim church , which itself had been built on the site of a Roman edifice . The Miracle at Remagen Bridge Remagen owes its second place in the sun to another miracle , concerning which there is no element of legend , although the exact circumstances are still somewhat confused because everything happened so quickly and without previous planning . But the basic facts are undisputed . On March 7 , 1945 , a combat command of the Ninth Armored Division , commanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Alaska Highway , * had been ordered to seize the city , the natural gateway of the Ahr River valley , and secure a bridgehead over this small stream near the point where it empties into the Rhine . It was a rather routine military operation to which no particular importance was attached .  | It was known that there was a steel railroad and pedestrian bridge across the Rhine itself between Remagen and the squalid little town of Erpel on the opposite bank . But nobody had any idea this bridge would not be demolished long before any American troops could reach it . The possibility of capturing it intact was , in fact , considered so remote that it was not even included in General Hoge 's orders . It now is recalled , however , that the night before , a high-ranking officer had remarked half jokingly to the general , as he pointed to the black dot indicating the bridge on the map , ' If you can capture that , you will live in history . " But as the armored column came over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched the Ludendorff Bridge , an unbroken span over the Rhine . Somebody had blundered ! Hoge took the responsibility of disregarding his actual orders in the face of this development . He rushed a company of infantry accompanying his tanks at double time across the bridge , bayonets fixed , to establish themselves on the opposite bank . As the men dashed across , without any opposition , there were two relatively small explosions . At the time , it appeared they did little damage , for German engineers charged with demolishing the bridge had delayed too long . The electric wiring to their demolition charges was faulty . When the button was pressed , the expected blasts failed to follow . Two days later three higher-ranking German officers in charge of the demolition detail faced the firing squad for what was perhaps the worst single blunder of the war . Very likely they will go down in popular German tradition , bound to seek scapegoats , as the  | fools or traitors who lost the war for the Reich . That is what nearly everybody across the Rhine will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence and it is an unjust reputation , says the officer charged with demolishing the bridge at Bonn , who was a personal friend of the executed men . He was captured a few days later after succeeding where they failed . The Rhine Is Spanned ! After hearing of the executions , he himself passed a terrible three hours . He had been ordered to wait until the last moment before blowing his own bridge , so that as many German troops as possible could escape over it . He was doubtful of his electrical installations after the terrible bomb shocks to which the bridge had been subjected . He knew the fate which awaited him if they failed . But his installations worked . The Rhine had been crossed and a bridgehead established on the other side without the loss of a single American life . It had been crossed at least a week before any such undertaking had been contemplated . The night which followed was one of cold , driving rain and such complete darkness as is hardly imaginable to one who has not experienced it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 miles of the bridgehead and rushed across in an endless stream . By dawn at least a regiment of infantry was in Erpel , and a day later a division headquarters was set up there . With the advantage of this bridgehead , American engineers got busy throwing ponton bridges over the Rhine , the greatest riverspanning military operation in history ( p. 5 ) . The Germans were quick in their efforts to correct the fateful blunder . They had nearly ideal artillery positions on the hills  | above Erpel . Seldom have towns received such terrible shellings as Remagen and Erpel during the next few days . The Americans , well dug in , withstood it . The enemy could not bring up guns and infantry fast enough to turn back the torrent of the conquerors . The Rhine was spanned . Such was the miracle of Remagen . At sunset one afternoon two weeks later I was coming over the mountaintop past the Franciscan monastery . Far below lay the remains of the Remagen bridge . It had just collapsed in the center . Most of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than they could ever know , for they lay in. traitors ' graves . Almost all the way from the Siegfried Line to the Rhine , infantrymen and tankers of the First Army marched and fought through lands of faerie . They tramped along Roman roads , they entered towns through gates built by Caesar 's legions , they bivouacked on hilltops among the stones of hoary temples . Their steps were dogged by the ghosts of history . Perhaps the most picturesque fight of the campaign was the capture , a few miles up the Rhine from Remagen , of the ancient ruins of Drachenfels , towering over the historic river . This was , of course , a small action and will have little significance in history . The mossy ruins of the castle stand at the summit of a 1,053-foot-high mountain ( page 12 ) . This was taken by an infantry battalion of the 78th Division led by Lt. Col. Richard Keyes , of Houston , Texas , at the point of the bayonet . On three sides were almost perpendicular cliffs . The battalion attacked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stiff fighting . The small German garrison in the ruins gave up quickly . For two days before the attack the mountain had been sub- iected to terrific artillery pounding , and the nerves of the defenders were shattered . The ruins afforded the best artillery observation : point for miles around . " Too Tired to Worry About Dragons " The doughboys slept in their blankets on the mossy wet stones that night . They were not bothered by ghosts . The first man over the walls , Pvt . Leslie Wright , of Fenton , Michigan , was asked if he knew the legend of Siegfried and the dragon . " I 'm too damn tired to worry about dragons , " he said . But , however little it might concern the fighting soldiers too weary to think of anything but sleep , they had captured one of the great legendary spots of the earth , around which are woven essential parts of both the Nibelungenlied and the cycle of Roland . There was the cave of the dragon slain by the great Teutonic knight Siegfried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Line is named . This perfect exemplar of all the warlike virtues probably would be none too pleased with his status as patron saint of Hitlerism . At Drachenfels , according to one story , he was sent by a ruse to be devoured by the monster . Instead , in singlehanded combat he broke the fire-belching brute 's back with one blow of his oaken club . Then he bathed in the dragon 's blood , which made his body invulnerable , except for one spot where a leaf from a lime tree had fallen during his blood bath . This spot was revealed by Siegfried 's wife Kriemhild to the fierce Brunhild , for whom the " grim Hagen ' ' slew the knight . Another legend , possibly modern in origin , associated with Drachenfels is that of the French Roland , nephew of Charlemagne , who came to the shores of the Rhine and lodged at the castle with the Burgrave Heribert , vassal of the emperor . He fell in love with the Burgrave 's daughter , Hildegunde . Suddenly came news of a Hun invasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hildegunde received word that he had been killed . She took the veil and entered the convent of Nonnenwerth , an island in the Rhine near by ( page 22 ) . Roland came back , but the maid remained true to her vows . Heartbroken , Roland built a castle on the opposite shore from whose upper windows he could watch his lost beloved walking in the cloister gardens . One day he saw her funeral procession and vowed that the time of their reunion was near . He returned to the wars and fell fighting , after many victories against the Saracens , at the great battle in the valley of Roncesvalles in the Pyrenees . Apparently there were other dragons on Drachenfels besides the monster slain by Siegfried . They persisted into the days of gunpowder , for , according to the legend , the last of them had the poor sense to attack a Rhine barge loaded with this new explosive . It blew the boat to bits when it exploded , and that was the end of dragons in the Rhineland . Of course gunpowder killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many of the old legends were symbolic , especially that of Siegfried and the lime leaf . One might say that the Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen was the spot where the leaf had fallen on the shoulder of Germany during her bath in the blood of the dragon Nazism . The tired doughboys slept soundly on the wet stones of the ruined castle . It was built in 1147 by an archbishop of Cologne , whose tenants for centuries were entitled to wear a red coat of arms bearing the figure of a fierymouthed , silver-winged dragon . Slave Labor in Underground Factory The next day the same battalion went on to capture one of the highest of a row of seven mountains of which Drachenfels is one ? the Petersberg . It forms the northwest corner of the Siebengebirge ( Seven Mountains ) and is a massive peak with a broad summit timbered with tall trees . Among the trees is a famous shrine , the Peter Chapel . Excavations carried out by the Rhenish provincial museum confirmed the existence there of a prehistoric circular rampart which formerly surrounded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time of need . It once was the scene of pagan sacrifices , which supposedly continued until the erection of an Augustinian monastery there by the hermit knight Walther in 1134 . This later passed into the hands of the Cistercian order and was the scene of great pilgrimages during the Middle Ages . It still is visited by thousands during Lent . The enemy fired only a few shots on Petersberg , but its capture was extremely important for men of the 78th Division , who leaped over the walls of the ancient rampart to bayonet the defenders . It opened up the country beyond the Seven Mountains . Of much interest to the Army was the discovery of an underground factory in an enlarged cavern on the slope of Petersberg . In it nearly 1,000 men and women , mostly Polish and Russian slave labor , were engaged in making airplane parts . The factory had been driven underground by Allied bombings , but had functioned efficiently . Its existence  | showed how the German armament industry had managed to survive . The American doughboy in a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elaborate castles on the Rhine which are still inhabited . Such , for example , was a family seat of the Hohenzollerns , the Catholic branch of the family and cousins of the Potsdam Hohenzollerns , with whom they claim never to have been on good terms . Second Division infantrymen were received graciously by a blond young princess , wife of the castle 's lord , Prince Albrecht Hohenzollern . She herself was of the Belgian royal line . Her husband 's kinsmen included the royal families of Bavaria and Romania . Her towheaded children playing about the courtyard were distant prospective heirs to half the former thrones of Europe . She showed the soldiers through the castle museum , filled with the armor of Crusader Hohenzollerns . The prince , a major in the German Army , was a war prisoner in Romania . She is a Junker and hates Nazis , the princess said . But the real thrill came at a neighboring castle . Here a mad , brave old lady , Baroness von Bethmann-Hollweg , of the family of the last German war chancellor , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanded by a major , had set up machine guns which swept the tortuous mountain road which the Americans must climb . She argued with the major ' hat he could not possibly stand out in the long run and that she had planned to raise a white flag immediately . Apparently her argument was convincing , for he begged h to hide him and his men in the cellar . She refused and gave them half an hour to leave her premises . This does n't seem half so convincing on paper as it did to hear the baroness tell it . She also was a Junker , she said , and all she liked about America was American cigarettes . The doughboys were allowed to enter without opposition , and she received a full pack . Then there was the ancient walled city of Zulpich on the way to the Rhine . Its castle was presided over by an extremely belligerent young woman who protested vigorously when Americans trespassed on her premises . It was found she had been a German WAC , a telephone operator at an airbase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemy 's armed forces and therefore was hurried away to a prisoner-of-war pen , protesting all the while that this was not the way to  | treat a lady with royal blood in her veins . There was much to interest the Ninth Division soldiers around Zulpich , especially the legends of a medieval William of Ulich , archfoe of the archbishops of Cologne , who owned the town . Citizens love to tell of the time William returned from the wars to find his wife had been unfaithful . He stripped her naked , smeared her body with honey , and suspended her out of a tower window in a wire cage . Bees stung her to death . William would have been a valuable addition to one of Hitler 's torture gangs , who have recently performed in his old field . Stars and Stripes over Ehrenbreitstein Of interest to United States readers is the present condition of the Mosel Valley between Trier and Koblenz , and of Koblenz itself , the stately little city at the junction of the Rhine and Mosel . It was the headquarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thousands of soldiers spent the winter and spring of 1918-19 there . For four years the American flag flew from Ehrenbreitstein , the massive old fortress where the two rivers join . Now the very same flag flies there again . This region was in the zone of the Third Army . It was the scene of violent fighting . Cities like Berncastel-Cues and Wittlich , together with scores of villages , are mostly rubble heaps left behind by the armored divisions . As for Koblenz itself , little more is left than of Cologne and Bonn . All the way down the Mosel the desolation extends . The picture is much the same as that of the country swept over by the First Army . Only such ruined castles as Veldenz and the towering pile which overlooks Berncastel remain the same . The people who seemed kindly and hospitable once , whose women actually wept when the Americans marched away , are stunned and sullen now . They have had for the first time a dose of the devastation which their own country has inflicted so unscrupulously on others in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rain-soaked rubbish of defeat . Along them march proudly , with flags flying high and dragging the few poor possessions they have been able to salvage in carts behind them , the hosts of the liberated Poles and French and Russians ? masters now where they lately were slaves .  |
