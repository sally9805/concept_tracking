txt Mayor La Guardia continued yesterday to withhold details of his proposed " transportation tax " to provide an annual revenue of $50 , - 000,000 , earmarked to wipe out subway deficits and provide transit improvements . The proposal , he said , would be made public some time in May and in the meantime those now disposed to criticize it could get rid of their " spleen and bile " so that they can consider the plan objectively when its details are revealed . The " transportation tax " was suggested by the Mayor in his annual budget message Saturday , accompanying his executive budget of $737,333 , : 48 for 1944-45 . It would not be a tax on transit fares , he indicated , but a city-wide impost to be " equitably distributed " among all sharing directly or indirectly in the benefits conferred by the city 's rapid transit system . " Let the critics find out what the plan is before they criticize , " the Mayor said . " Let everybody , get all the spleen and bile out of ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration . That , of course , is quite a bit to expect from some quarters . Patience and fortitude and it 'll all come out all right . " Way Cleared by Board Action In political circles the Mayor 's " transportation tax " proposal was viewed as the explanation of his March 5 broadcast from City Hall , 1 in which he raised the issue of a ' . fare rise , starting a chain of events that led the Board of Estimate , on March 23 , to reject all higher fare I proposals and to place itself on , record , by unanimous vote , in favor of continuing the five-cent fare . The Mayor thus cleared the way ' for presentation of an alternative method of meeting the subway I deficits . By this means he made it pos-H sible , perhaps by local law or voters ' petitions , to get a referendum expression in November that might be used as a lever to pry from the 1945 Legislature the enabling acts permitting the city to set up its new " transportation tax . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details of his 1944-45 budget were completely overshadowed , so far as public reaction was concerned , by his suggestion of a " transportation tax . " Speculation concerning the nature of this tax centered about the possibility that the Mayor wanted the Legislature to give the city power to increase its present sales tax and perhaps its other special taxes , Isuch as those on utilities , business and mortgages , with provisions earmarking enough of the proceeds to take care of subway deficits , now totaling 841,118,808 a year . In this connection it was noted that the Mayor desired to have the present special taxes made permanent . Windels Against " Trick Way " 1 Among those inclined to believe that the Mayor had in mind a type of expanded sales tax were groups sponsoring an increased fare on the city transit lines . Some of these stuck to their higher fare guns , while others preferred to suspend jUdgment until the Mayor ' * plan was made public . Paul Windels , forrner Corporation Counsel , now heading the Citizens Transit Cotrunittee , issued a statement declaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subway deficit was a problem no longer to be evaded . The " transportation tax , " Mr. Windels said , was " nothing more than his old scheme of getting ' more taxing power for himself guised by a new name . " The Mayor , Mr. Windels said , ought to knOW by this tiMe thakthere is no " trick way " to solve the problem and that the cost of transportation should fall upon those who use the facilities . Russell L. Cruikshank , president of the Real Estate Board of New York , was among those expressing the view that the Mayor 's proposal could not be discussed intelligently until its details were made public . He hailed it , however , as an indication that the subway deficit problem was being handled seriously . The Citizens Budget Commission issued a statement that ignored the " transportation tax " suggestion , but took issue with the Mayor 's contention that the 1944-1945 executive budget represented an actual saving of about $54,000 , - 000 to the taxpayers . Many of the " savings " in the budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mayor de ' served no credit . In this category were listed the State 's contribution of $13,500,000 , a " gift " of $10,983 , - 000 due to relief recipients going into war jobs , and a surplus of $5,700,000 resulting from excessive taxation of real estate in the current fiscal year . The commission criticized the Mayor for maintaining what it termed a " secretive policy " regarding the methods to be used to find ' the money to pay salaries of city employes now in the armed services , whose appropriations are currently being used , according to the commission , for other purposes . Mayor La Guardia , in his weekly broadcast from City Hall , announced that the text of his budget message would be published today in THE NEW YORK TIMES , to which he expressed gratitude for " this very splendid and generous contribution . " A limited number . of copies of the message have been printed.by the city and the Mayor 's office has been unable to meet all requests for copies .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
