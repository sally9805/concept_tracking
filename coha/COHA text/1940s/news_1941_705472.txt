txt Defending Lincoln It really grieved me to read The Associated Press dispatch from Spring-. field , III. , in THE Trmss on March 29 , in which the statement was made that Abraham Lincoln , perhaps the most revered of all Americans , had been guilty of drawing $4 a day salary as a member of the Illinois General Assembly fora days when , under the law , he was not entitled to it by reason of nonattend. ance . Is it not possible that attendance fosl a part of a day might have sufficed and that was the common practice ? Furthermore , might the law have related to only a part of the period in question and when Mr. Lincoln was not a member of the House ? What I am trying to bring out is that it is just too bad to publish a reflection as grave as this unless the person making the charge is absolutely certain . of his facts . CHARLES H. STRONG . New York , March 31 , 1941.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
