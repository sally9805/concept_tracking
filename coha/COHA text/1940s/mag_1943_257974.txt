A Believe-It-or-Notable character is Thomas Harrington McKittrick , 54 , of Milton , Mass. and Basel , Switzerland . Though he is a U.S. citizen , and his country is at war , he is a neutral in office hours . For he is the President of the Bank for International Settlements . <P> Next week he will probably arise in the empty board room of the bank 's five-story building in the old Swiss city of Basel and , as he has three times before , go through the motions of presenting and accepting the annual report . He will have been authorized to do so by proxies of the bank 's 17 directors , 13 of whom are controlled by the Axis powers , and one of whom is Walther Funk himself ( Reich Minister of Economics ) . <P> Spies and 6% . In a world at war , in a world busily inventing new types of international currency and banking instrumentalities , the Bank for International Settlements has passed almost completely from public notice .

These operations consist chiefly of : 1 ) collecting interest ; 2 ) semi-automatic renewal of maturing investments ( no new ones are made ) ; 3 ) extending limited credits to central banks ; 4 ) handling payments under the international postal agreement and prewar treaties ; 5 ) acting as banker for the International Red Cross organizations operating from Switzerland .

While in the U.S. he did not comment on the fact that the Nazis refrain from using the Axis majority on the board of directors for unneutral undertakings . To all such queries he replied : " Remember , I 'm neutral . " Once he amplified this : " The policy of the bank can only be to remain entirely outside all matters of politics .
