Al Smith , in white suit and Panama hat , strutted into the White House one day last week for a 15-minute chat with Franklin Roosevelt on New York politics . The talk was so good that Mr. Smith overstayed his time by 30 minutes . In an anteroom Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson and OWI 's Elmer Davis cooled their heels until the political talk was over . <P> This made the fourth successive day on which Franklin Roosevelt , pushing aside the problems of war , had received New York politicos , had engaged in long political discussions . Earlier callers had been Senator Robert F. Wagner ; Representative Michael J. Kennedy , the pushing new leader of Tammany , and gum-champing , pewter-haired Edward J. Flynn , who came for lunch . On Tuesday the President devoted a goodly part of his only press conference of the week to a discussion of New York 's gubernatorial race . <P> Blitz Tactics . One non-caller was James Aloysius Farley . Genial Jim had made a White House call early in June , had indicated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : mild , blameless Attorney General John J. Bennett Jr . By last week 51 of the 62 county organizations , said Farley , were committed to Bennett . <P> Then came the White House blow-off Jim Farley had prepared against . Senator Wagner , on leaving the Executive Mansion , announced that the President would back any " liberal " candidate . Next day Tammany Leader Kennedy amended the definition : Franklin Roosevelt would back any liberal who had backed the Roosevelt foreign policy 100% before Pearl Harbor . <P> Man to Fit . Unperturbed , Jim Farley smoothly said that the man who fit those requirements was , of course , John Bennett . Ed Flynn , hedging , declared that the description could cover many men : Bennett or New Deal Senator James M. Mead - even Al Smith . But Smith quickly eliminated himself ; " I 'm too old , " said he . <P> Out of all the doubletalk , one fact was clear : the President wanted tall , toothy , honest , earnest Senator Mead . The President 's choice was based on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could get American Labor Party support , needed to beat Tom Dewey . Jim Mead , with four secure years in the Senate ahead of him , and with at least 50 friends among the 51 bosses committed to Bennett , was cagey . He craftily named his own candidate : Jim Farley . <P> Everybody had lots to say about who was to be the next Governor of New York - except the people .
