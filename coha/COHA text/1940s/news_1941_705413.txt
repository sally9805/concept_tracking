txt The legal reserve life-insurance companies had over $28,000,000,000 of assets in 1938 and over $111,000,000,000 of insurance in force . The twenty-six largest companies alone controlled a daily average flow f over $10,000,000 to invest . On the face of it there is doubtless as good an argument to be made for Federal supervision of the life-insurance companies as for the regulation of public utilities , banks , or any other form of private enterprise now subject to Washington 's supervision . The proposals recommended to the Temporary National Economic Committee by Sumner T. Pike , Securities and Exchange Commissioner , are fairly mild . They call for " limited supervision " by a Federal agency to assist in strengthening regulation by the States . Unfortunately , there is an all too obvicue connection between the suggestion of Federal supervision of the life-insurance companies and a growing insistence in certain New Deal circles that the Government must be given greater control over the savings of the people and the direction of their investment . In both the report prepared under the auspices of the Securities and Exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was laid upon the desirability of having life-insurance funds invested in common stocks so as to provide " equity financing " and to check the prevalent trend of industrial financing through the issuance of debt . The argument is that equity or partnership capital is no longer available to new enterprise and that industry is in danger of becoming overburdened with debt . There is good ground for this fear , but how did the situation arise ? For ten years common stocks have been in disrepute . Hammering home the lessons of the 1929 crash , the New Deal financial reformers have made the words " stock " and " speculation " terms of reproach . Regulation , taxation and a general atmosphere of hostility have taken the venturesome spirit out , of capital . In spite of the growing needs of industry , American corporations raised only $135,000,000 of new capital by stock financing last year , against $311,000,000 in the severe depression year 1931 . Now there is much wonder why capital does not flow into equities . Something must be done about it , and of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the insurance companies provide equity financing for new enterprise is relatively mild compared with another which has lately been advanced . Mordecai Ezekiel , economic adviser to the Department of Agriculture , proposed to the TNEC that the Government , to meet the problem of " excess savings , " must borrow the people 's savings and spend them , must tax the savings away and spend them and , by a combination of measures , must reduce both savings and the willingness to save . " It is obviously a temporary proce dure , " said Mr. Ezekiel . But that is precisely what it is not . It is a procedure which , once adopted , can only result in a permanent change in our economic and political system . For it is based upon the premise that the normal flow of savings into productive investment is no longer possible , and that Government must become the complete regulator of both savings and investment . Before Government undertakes to control all savings or even to direct the flow of life-insurance funds into the new and risky channels of equity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the barriers which it is itself responsible for placing in the way of the natural flow of individual savings into common stocks .
