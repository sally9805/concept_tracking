MONASTERY SECRETS . . . the Forbidden Knowledge of Tibet . . . Like the streams that trickle from the Himalayan heights to the plateau below , the great truths of these brotherhoods have descended through the ages . . <P> . Write to-day for . . . FREE Sealed Book , with its amazing revelations about these mysteries of life . " Last week this ad , like hundreds of others before it in such respectable publications as the New York Times Magazine Section , was bringing sacks of letters to the headquarters of the Rosicrucians in San Jose , Calif . After receiving their free Sealed Book , some of the ad-answerers would go on to become members of AMORC ( the Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis ) and pay dues of $2.50 a month to learn " through alchemy , metaphysics and cosmology " how to be happy . But many a faithful U.S. Rosicrucian might be jolted by the picture of the San Jose order painted in a lawsuit filed by the widow of the cofounder . <P> Faith &; Finance . Mrs. Myra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share in what she claims he and his partner had conceived as " a business of conducting rituals , ceremonials , lessons , instructions and the sale of books and periodicals . . . " They founded AMORC , she says , " as a device to disseminate information , lessons and instructions to others for a profit . " The take , she contends , is good . According to Widow Kiimalehto , the AMORC membership is now around 2 , - 000,000 ( which Rosicrucian officials claim is a gross exaggeration ) . <P> This successful blend of faith and finance , according to Myra Kiimalehto , was at first administered jointly by Thor , her slight , pince-nezed Swedish immigrant husband , and ex-Methodist Harvey Spencer Lewis , former president of an " Institute for Psychical Research . " Together they applied modern U.S. selling methods to a potpourri of lore derived from the ancient esoteric Rosicrucian cult which dates back beyond the isth Century . In 1928 , the Lewis-Kiimalehto brand of Rosicrucianism found in San Jose a happy combination of favorable weather and favorable authorities . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to be " Imperator of the Supreme Grand Lodge . " Kiimalehto sold his New York printing shop and came along to San Jose in 1936 as " Sovereign Grand Master . " <P> Mummies &; Metaphysics . Today the mosquelike structures of Rosicrucian Park house an Egyptian and Oriental museum ( complete with genuine mummies ) , an auditorium , a library , a shrine dedicated to Pharaoh Amenhotep IV , a planetarium and Rose Croix University , with its Colleges of Fine Arts , Mundane and Arcane Sciences and Humanities . <P> Lewis died in 1939 , Kiimalehto in 1948 . Mrs. Kiimalehto , who has not been a practicing Rosicrucian for four years , says that she is not interested in money but in rescuing AMORC from the control of Lewis ' son , daughter-in-law and widow . Last week Rosicrucian leaders filed their answer to Widow Kiimalehto 's suit : the Kiimalehto-Lewis team , they said , had not been a business partnership . Meanwhile , the checks and money orders continued to roll in from those who yearn to learn about " the system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the individual whereby he may utilize to a better advantage his natural talents and lead a more happy life .
