txt The end of our trek across the desert is now in sight . A few miles in front of us the barren landscape suddenly has sprung to life and we can see green hills speckled with neat white houses . A straight gravel road lined with Lombard poplars beckons toward high ridges walling in the northern skyline beyond which lies Tripoli , scarcely 50 miles away . Traffic on the road is headed northward  --  all but three vehicles from which the thick black smoke of burning oil and rubber billows skyward . They were set afire by British tanks early this morning . There are other elements that mar " the otherwise peaceful landscape . Flashes along the crest of the ridge are answered by puffs of smoke and dust in the foreground where the enemy is shelling the vanguard of the British column . The artillery fire is intense and the enemy 's observation posts must be excellent , for wherever the vehicles turn seeking unexposed ground , enemy shells follow them . We were almost caught that way this morning when driving about in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two directly behind . British Artillery Replies But while soft vehicles scurry out of range , tanks hold their ground and gradually the Royal Artillery gunners , heedless of enemy fire , move their pieces into position and , as day advances , the volume of return fire gradually increases as new batteries join in the chorus . The duel continues with varied intensity until darkness comes , when it slackens to silenee . Meanwhile behind us as far as the field of vision extends , the sandy valley is filled with vehicles carefully dispersed , as a precaution against enemy aircraft but in their multitude amid the sands they are strangely reminiscent of Coney Island or Rever Beach on a Sunday in July . That is the body of column temporarily marking time while the head decides what to do about this last barrier between ourselves and Tripoli . The enemy position obviously is strong . Behind the ridge where his guns are poised he has tanks . not many , but good ones . To send our tanks charging head on against such an obstacle would be the sheerest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy and blasting his emplacements is left stand , and when he pulls out from his present positions the way to Tripoli will be clear . RAF Passes Overhead Today , for the first time since the campaign was resumed , we had no Stuka raids . Instead , Royal Air Force sweeps passed overhead repeatedly . From our front lines we watched them bomb and strafe enemy positions . Almost overnight the air force has moved up to fields captured from the enemy , thus keeping pace with the groued advance . It is a far cry from Alamein to Tripoli . As Gen. Sir Bernard L. Montgomery recently pointed out , the distance covered by the Eighth Army in its historic advance equals that from London to Moscow . The troops participating , with the exception of small Greek and Free French units , were entirely British . But though no American troops took part in the land campaign or accompanied the Eighth Army , America 's contribution to the African victory is considerable . For this has been a triumph of motorization and mechanization . If vehicles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Eighth Army never would be where it is , and these N ehicles , from Sherman tanks to jeeps , including trucks , are mostly American made . The jeep , in particular , has proved invaluable in the desert , also the White scout car which a colonel described to me as the most satisfactory control vehicle ever produced , although its armor plate is only effective against small-arms fire . An example of war 's lighter side is provided by two Army sergeant photographers whom I met. today traveling about in a jeep . The vehicle never has given them any trouble , except that a month ago they acquired a mouse as a stowaway . Efforts to dislodge him have proved fruitless , as he hides under the seat , where no one can reach him . Meanwhile , he raids their rations , eats holes in their bedding , and destroys labels on their canned goods so they do n't know what is inside . They are becoming " desperate " about him and are hoping to pick up a mousetrap or a cat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
