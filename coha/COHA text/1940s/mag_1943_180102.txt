Farmland values have risen more sharply within the past year than for more than 20 years past . Most of the increase has occurred since last November . OWI , reporting this , said that things are not yet out of hand : despite the past year 's overall jump of 9% , per-acre values are still just below the 1912-14 average . But the steepness of the rise is cause for alarm . <P> The last time the farmland value line took a perpendicular upward direction it finally went through the roof . Many a farmer is still in hock because he forgot then that what goes up , etc . On the awful 1921-35 toboggan the average value of a U.S. farm nosedived from $10,284 to $4,825 ; some 85,000 farmers hit bottom and went through the wringer in the ' 30s . But this time there are indications that the U.S. farmer does not yet need to be reminded of those doleful years . Most hopeful contrasts between now &; then : <P> &gt;Last year U.S. farmers reduced their total mortgage debt by $360,000,000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . Total farm debt is down some 10% from the beginning of 1939 , whereas farm mortgages almost doubled in value between 1915 and 1920 . <P> &gt; Most farmers are also cagily plunking down more &; more hard cash for the land they buy , even though interest rates are temptingly low . In the last quarter of 1942 only half the parcels of land bought in the North Central states involved any mortgage at all , and of those , 35% of the purchase prices was paid for in cash . In the Northern Plains only 18% of all the recorded transfers involved a mortgage . <P> &gt; A substantial fraction of the present rise in farm values is due to city-slicker dollars in search of a hedge against inflation . " Chicago money " has poured into Illinois farm land in recent months ; an Iowa farm broker last week reported that one eastern moneybags had just banked $400,000 in Des Moines and was looking for land to spend it on . <P> Farm equipment and manpower shortages , gas rationing and a host of other wartime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to now . The real danger in the 1943 boomlet is that too many farmers might decide to take a flyer in land for speculation 's sake and not for the land 's produce . Against that psychology , if &; when it arrives , the U.S. farmer 's best weapon will be a long memory .
