Last month Missouri 's Senator Frank Briggs received a routine patronage notice from the postal department : the $4,500-a-year postmastership at Clinton , Mo . ( pop . 6.041 ) was open . <P> Senator Briggs , a trained machine politician , dutifully asked the Henry County Democratic Committee for the name of a deserving Democrat for the job . The committee decided on 33-year-old Clyde Smith , a World War II veteran . In due time Smith got his notice of appointment signed by the first assistant postmaster general . He turned his oil business over to his wife , moved into the postoffice . <P> Last week , after 27 days in office , Postmaster Smith was fired . His appointment was withdrawn , and he was told to make way for one Walter Menefee , 53 , who had been deputy U.S. marshal at Springfield ( 85 miles from Clinton ) . There was no doubt that Menefee had the post . His credentials were signed by Postmaster General Bob Hannegan . <P> The folks in Clinton were mystified , until someone recalled Walter Menefee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry Truman 's Battery D , 129th Field Artillery , in World War I.
