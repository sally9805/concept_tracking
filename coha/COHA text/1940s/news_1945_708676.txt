txt Letters Rev. BENJAMIN L MASSE , S.J.W.A. FREEDMAN . Letters AN ANNUAL WAGE TO THE EDITOR : in a recent issue of your magazine , a correspondent took me to task for jumping " from economics to natural law and thence to the moral law . " If your correspondent will go to the original piece ( America ) , from which Philip Murray quoted in his article , " A Guaranteed Annual Wage for Labor ? " he will , I trust , absolve me from the charge of talking nonsense . Certainly , I did not say that " the world owes every man a living wage "  --  a very unscriptural doctrine ! May I point out that in the paragraphs which disturbed your correspondent I used " moral law " and " natural law " as synonyms ? Since economics , while having its own " laws , " is also subject to the divine moral law , moralists have a right to speak in the market place . To venture a moral estimate of an economic program involves no trespassing on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. J. New York . In his article Mr. Murray quoted Father Masse as follows : " Every normal adult workingman , whose only access to the wealth of nature is his pay envelope , has a right to an annual family living wage . Nature itself , and therefore nature 's God , has clearly ordained that the riches of the earth are destined for the maintenance and development of men . Every man has , accordingly , an inalienable right to use these resources to achieve his temporal and eternal destiny as a human being and a child of God . Furthermore , since nature also ordains that the generality of men marry and raise a family , the right to use the wealth of nature belongs to man not merely as an individual but also as the father of a family . From these elemental moral truths there follows logically the right of the adult wage-earner to a family living wage . " SNIPE BOATS To THE EDITOR : I want to take exception to Beatrice Oppenheim 's statement in her article on the boom in sailing activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " boat that used to sell new for $75 , but that used ones now bring $150 . This scandalizes an important section of the yachting fraternity . There are over 5,000 registered snipe class boats . The sails alone for my snipe cost about $80 . I would be glad to pay $150 for a set of sails but the Snipe Class International Association restricts the cost of the sails to an $85 limit . It would be very easy to spend as much as $1,000 to build a snipe were it not for these restrictions . W. A. FREEDMAN . New York .
