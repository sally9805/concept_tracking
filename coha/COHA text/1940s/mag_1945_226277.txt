It was a party Jiggs would have mightily enjoyed . Into the lofty grand ballroom of Manhattan 's Waldorf-Astoria , shirt-sleeved waiters , sweating , bumping against chairs and calling hoarse warnings , ferried outsize trays of corned beef &; cabbage . Powers models swirled among the 1,031 guests , handing out clay pipes . On the stage , aging Funnyman Arthur ( " Bugs " ) Baer cracked wise , a line of Bloomer Girls pranced through a dance routine , Bing Crosby crooned Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral , and then Morton Downey sang it again . <P> When it was over , the guest of honor , a fat , button-nosed oldster who is regarded by his cronies as the spit &; image of Jiggs , hustled back to work . George McManus was a little worried at taking two hours for lunch , even if Mr. Hearst was paying the bill . <P> Millionaire in Chains . The Waldorf-Astoria luncheon celebrated a comic-strip milestone : McManus had started Bringing Up Father in the old New York American exactly a third of a century ago . Its durability was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endlessly repeated , and to Publisher Hearst 's taste in comics . Most readers were under the impression that Jiggs had never changed in all the years they had read it . But it was n't so : the women 's dress styles in Jiggs had advanced to circa 1928 , and Jiggs himself looked quite different from his first appearance in 1912 . <P> Silk-hatted Jiggs had made McManus a well-dressed millionaire-and had chained him to a seven-day week . In Manhattan last week to attend the lunch and to sign a contract for a series of Maggie &; Jiggs movies , McManus borrowed an office . There he and assistant " Zeke " Zekley scratched away to keep up to date on the daily and Sunday strips for which more than 400 newspapers in 32 countries pay him more than $100,000 a year . <P> Nobody who reads Bringing Up Father can be sure whether Jiggs is a first name or a last ( McManus does n't know either ) , or how Jiggs made his money ( McManus thinks he must have been an Irish contractor , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers ) . But of some things they may be sure , like their parents before them : Jiggs ca n't stand his wife 's friends , lives in daily fear of her well-aimed rolling pin and crockery , but will never hit back . And there will never be a continued story in Jiggs . Says McManus : " I give ' em a gag a day . " <P> Corn , but No Beer . The first strip McManus did for Hearst was a slapstick called The Newlyweds . Last year old Mr. Hearst got to remembering it-even though he could n't remember its name-and ordered the artist to resume " that strip with the baby . " So , since January , the Sunday Jiggs strip has had Snookums and the Newlyweds at its top . Hearst once told McManus that " rushing the growler " was out , since subscribers in dry states might be offended to see the characters lugging cans of beer . <P> " Then W.R. went on a trip , " said McManus . " I kept on with the beer . Pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to take out the liquor . ' Sometimes I think all he looks at is the comics . "
