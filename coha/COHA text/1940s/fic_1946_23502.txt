PEEKABOO PENNINGTON , PRIVATE EYE JOHN BARTLOW MARTIN Decorations by Robert Osborn A NYONE whose prior acquaintance with private detectives has been limited to the heroes of detective novels would have a hard time recognizing William V. Pennington as the foremost real-life private eye of San Francisco . Fictional private detectives fall into two groups : the erudite thinkers and the toughies . Philo Vance and Nero Wolfe , the descendants of Sherlock Holmes , think very hard , though they make it look easy , and they do most of their crime-busting from armchairs , rarely stirring from their studies and their exotic scholarly hobbies . Clever crime fascinates these stu-dents , slaughter bores them . On the other hand , Sam Spade and Ned Beaumont , who work for Dashiell Hammett , and the detectives invented by Erie Stanley Gardner and Raymond Chandler , among others , would just as soon operate in an abattoir as a drawing room and they eschew studies to mix it up with the unsavory criminals whom they are after and from whom they frequently are almost indistinguishable . Their hobbies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one student has noted , " brutal , grasping , lecherous ' heels . ' " Such a shamus is always finding a body , knows many hoodlums , kicks in a lot of doors , has innumerable angles , most of them illegal , and is constantly dealing with murder , revenge , phony wills , crooked politicians , family quarrels , and adultery . In a single Hammett novel the detective shot and stabbed one man to death , helped shoot another dead , was himself attacked with dagger , gun , chloroform , and bomb , fought off a ghostly manifestation barehanded , wrestled with five women , cured a girl of narcotic addiction , and in addition was obliged to deal with one seduction , eight murders , a jewel burglary , and a family curse . This is about par for a case . Almost invariably the tough detective lives alone , drinks a lot , double-crosses the cops , and narrowly escapes jail ; invariably he is a disenchanted character . The toughies , rather than the brainy heroes , are generally considered to resemble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once a private detective himself , drew on his own experiences when he wrote . If so , his experiences were unusual . Writers of the hard-boiled school like to set their novels on the West Coast , more especially in San Francisco , perhaps because its hills , fogs , waterfront , and proximity to the Orient provide suitably dramatic props for violence . Frequently the chase leads into Chinatown , into the arms of a blonde , or into the clutches of a sinister figure from the Levant or the Balkans . William V. Pennington , a successful real-life private detective in San Francisco , never put anybody in jail , never shot or shot at anybody , never was shot or shot at , never stabbed or was stabbed , never was chloroformed , never had a study to think in , never made serious love to a blonde , never saw a ghost , never drinks on the job and sparingly off it , gets along with the cops , lives quietly with his wife and three children in a suburban house , has no hobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing ( not even detective stories ) , knows no hoodlums , can be described more accurately as a Babbitt than as a " brutal , grasping , lecherous heel , ' " has had but one case in Chinatown ( he flopped completely ) , and no case involving anybody from the Levant and only one involving anybody from the Balkans . r-rms man from the Balkans was not I sinister ( at least not by detective novel standards ) : he had come to San Francisco as an adviser to the Yugoslav delegation to the UNO convention . More , probably , than any other this case lifted Pennington to the top of the heap among San Francisco private detectives . Pennington had been hired by a gentleman from Oakland to follow his wife . Pennington discovered her in the room of the Balkan diplomat in the fashionable Fairmont Hotel atop Nob Hill . This case was strictly routine . Pennington 's only remarkable achievement was getting past the Military Police , FBI agents , Army investigators , and other vigilant characters who swarmed all over the Fairmont during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak in Yugoslav in front of the guards , creating the impression that he was a delegate . ) But the case attracted international attention , precipitated a crisis between the Tito and Mikhailovitch factions , and made Pennington famous . Jack McDowell , a newspaperman friend of Pennington 's , referred to him in a story as " Peekaboo " Pennington , and this turned out to be magic . Today if you tell almost anybody in San Francisco that you have just come from lunch with a private detective , he is more than likely to say , " Not that fellow they call Peekaboo ? " This is like money in the bank to Pennington . Though he professes an earnest desire to elevate private detecting to respectability , Pennington has never been heard to object to being called Peekaboo . ( He is acutely conscious of the value of publicity and cultivates his newspaper friends assiduously , distributing numerous modest gifts at Christmas and other times . ) Three years ago he was just another of the twenty-five private detectives listed in the Bay Area classified directory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year his income " ran into five figures , " as he puts it , adding with some pride that he hired a CPA to figure out his income tax . He has two cars and a summer place at Lake Tahoe and he intends to buy a Chris-Craft this summer . He wo n't touch a case for less than a $100 retainer and recently he collected a single fee of $5,000 . He refuses all but the most lucrative cases . Among his clients have been some of the wealthiest people in town . Successful divorce lawyers consider him tops . One told him recently he was hiring him simply to scare the opposition . He gets more publicity than all the other private eyes in the Bay Area combined . Newspaper writers refer to him as " purveyor of gum-shoed information to society , " " the noted Bay Area love nest expert , " and " the private eye whose specialty is throwing thorns on beds of roses . " It is not surprising that the public , misled by novelists , has the wrong idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hammett 's operatives said he worked " with the object of putting people in jail . " Nothing could be farther from Peekaboo Pennington 's mind . Not long ago an excited woman phoned and wanted him to come over immediately because somebody was trying to climb through her bedroom window . He referred her to the police . II W HEN Allan Pinkerton was appointed a deputy sheriff in Chicago exactly a hundred years ago , public law enforcement was poorly organized , and he and the private agency he soon formed to fill the gap unquestionably put a lot of people in jail , however much he romanticized his adventures in his published works . But today if private detectives had to make a living off crime they would starve to death . They could not hope to compete with the police . Their province embraces the vast body of wrongdoing which does not come under the penal code , together with a lot of other things that worry mankind and can not even be termed wrongdoing . Of course private detectives sometimes catch criminals . But an agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company is more interested in voiding the arsonist 's insurance claim than in jailing him . Similarly , the prime objective of a private detective who tracks down a jewel thief is to retrieve the jewels . If an agency unmasks a dishonest bank teller , the bank , rather than bother to prosecute him , simply gets its money back and fires him . Most of these crimes are small and hard to prove . The police handle the big cases that result in prosecution . When private detectives do solve a big case it is usually because , privately paid , they could afford to carry on after the case went cold and the overworked cops , harassed by new depredations , were forced to drop it . Detectives like Paul Drake in Erle Stanley Gardner 's novels work the other side of the street . They try to build up a defense in criminal cases . Detectives do this mostly in books . There is so much feeling  --  and so much law  --  against witness tampering that most defense attorneys wo n't let a private eye touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty much a matter of ( a ) crying police brutality or ( b ) confessing everything and invoking the unwritten law . A defense lawyer needs a dramatic coach more than he needs a private detective . However , Pennington has done a little criminal defense work . Once , working for a sailor accused of killing a peace officer with his own gun , Pennington discovered the officer had a reputation of being quarrelsome while drinking . The sailor pleaded self-defense and was acquitted . Some years ago Pennington , posing as a surveyor , obtained from children 's gossip evidence that beat a charge of attempted rape against his client . Only once has he been arrayed with the prosecution : when a stranger tried to use him as the fall guy in a blackmail and arson plot , Pennington called the police , who investigated and arrested the man . OME private detective agencies special- C ize in skip-tracing , that is , locating persons who have chosen to disappear . Skip-tracing is a good example of a hole in the law that the private detective plugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband has disappeared , they are likely to say , " He 's free , white , and twenty-one . " Similarly , the disappearance of a girl of , say , fifteen fails to excite the police unless evidence of crime is discovered . Skip-tracing is one of the most difficult branches of private detective work . Pennington has tried it a few times , but most of the tracing he has done has been incidental to his divorce work . Many detective agencies provide plant guards and patrolmen . Others make what are called " personnel surveys " in stores , hotels , night clubs , restaurants , banks , and transportation systems . In plainer words , they find out how much the employees are stealing . Some detectives check on job applicants , make credit reports , or investigate personal injury claims for insurance companies and common carriers . The big agencies depend largely on industrial accounts . This sometimes gets them into strike-breaking . Pennington claims he has never handled a labor case , and the long memories of San Francisco labor men bear him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases down when they were offered . " I 'm sympathetic to labor . Besides , " he added ingenuously , " I could n't afford to touch a case like that . " Like a politician he hates to make enemies . But business investigation does not always involve labor disputes . It was an investigation of hidden assets for a receivership that led Pennington to set himself up in shop as a private detective . Most of this investigation was paperwork , though he actually followed a few men to locate safe deposit boxes or pieces of property they had concealed . However , business investigations usually require a large organization composed , Iike the FBI , chiefly of accountants and lawyers . For a private eye operating alone , the fireworks  --  and money  --  in the private detection industry lie in divorce . Some of the substantial agencies like Burns and Pinkerton will tell you they refuse divorce cases , because unscrupulous lesser detec tives , employing such subterfuges as the badger game , have made a racket out of adultery . Nevertheless , few agencies have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hot divorce case is to the detective what a crackling criminal case is to a bored lawyer . Today Peekaboo Pennington handles nothing but divorce . III WNNINGTON is forty-five , blue-eyed , r rather slight-150 pounds , five feet eight and a half  --  and white-haired . " I grayed early , " he has said . " It helps me . Women have confidence in me , they 'll confide in me . " His size helps him too : in shadow work a man who is either unusually large or small is conspicuous . There is nothing striking about Pennington 's appearance except his peculiar crablike walk , acquired by riding horseback as a boy . A prospective client exclaimed , when she first saw him , " You 're not Mr. Pennin , ? ton , are you ? You look like a preacher . " To others he looks like an aging salesman . He has the monotonous sing-song way of speaking affected by some ministers when they talk about sin , the quick professional sympathy of an undertaker , and a politician 's ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wears glasses and in consultation appears judicious and deliberate , but while at work he is tense and nervous . Small , he is likely to jump up and down , birdlike , to look over the heads of a crowd for the man he is tailing . His ambition is to write and though recently he has had no time for it , he once wrote a lot of poems with such titles as " Children 's Day at Our House , " " Worry-in ' , " and " The Ship of Life . " None has been published except in a column of comment he formerly wrote for six weekly newspapers in the Midwest . One night not long ago , watching a love nest from his darkened car , Pennington said , " I have no social inclinations . My family means more to me than to any man alive . Mother and I have been married twenty-four years . I guess that 's a record out here . I try to lead the kind of life I 'd like to see others lead . I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hah , hah , hah . " Strange words for a real-life Sam Spade . He frequently takes friends along on his jobs , partly to keep him company , partly because he knows they are interested . Most people on meeting him ask how he happened to become a detective , and when some of them ask , a peculiar gleam comes into their eyes , as though secretly they 'd like to try it too . Probably they would ; schools which advertise " FOLLOW THAT MAN " enjoy substantial enrollments . Whenever a big crime breaks hundreds of people try to solve it , thereby getting in the way of police investigation . Every private detective knows the spouse who sheepishly admits he has sought professional aid only after his own efforts have failed . Usually by this tittle the case is hopeless . When people ask how he became a detective he usually replies , " I guess I 'm just naturally inquisitive by nature . " If they press him even a little , he tells his life story . He enjoys this , because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but they have no reason to be , for in Penning-ton 's life story there is not a single clue to how to become a successful detective . H E WAS born May 8 , 1900 , near Smith Center , Kansas . In high school at Colorado Springs , Colorado , he distinguished himself as a debater and orator ; characteristically , he made this ability pay off by spending his summers guiding sightseers through the Cave of the Winds and other wonders . " I can still give the spiel , " he said recently and did . After three months in the Army and a few weeks of college he married a girl who had been born and reared a few miles from him . They settled on one of his father 's large farms ; his father was a wealthy farmer with other extensive financial interests . " I was living in the lap of luxury , " Pennington has said . But soon bad times came . " Then the grasshoppers , the chinch bugs , the drought . It was the start of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAGAZINE So in 1926 Pennington moved his family -- -his son William was three  --  to Smith Center and borrowed $6,000 and bought the only motion picture house . He made money when the talkies came . " Then a chain theater came in and opened up right next door and built a big modern theater and they broke me . I lost my home , lost one of my cars , and my business . And I was broke flat . " Like many another victim of adversity in the troubled early thirties , Pennington entered politics . He ran for the state legislature . Alf Landon was running for governor , and Pennington rigged up a public address system in his car , using movie sound equipment from his closed-down theater , and stumped western Kansas . Landon won , but Pennington lost . He went to Topeka . Landon rewarded him with a job as an oil inspector , preventing oil bootleggers from dodging the state tax . The state police had already done the real detective work ; Pennington was simply an administrator who ran a Port of Entry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks . True , he sometimes followed suspected trucks ; but he never caught a bootlegger that way . H AvING saved $300 out of his state sal- ary of $125 a month he put his two children and his pregnant wife in his 1930 Chevrolet and headed for California where , as a hay fever and allergy sufferer , he had always wanted to live . Looking back on that time he said recently , " I got to San Francisco in 1934 just as the waterfront strike was on . Streets barricaded . Men fighting for jobs . I was n't well . So when a man comes West and he 's sick and he 's broke and he 's got a family it takes a lotta guts to go through with it , tell you that .

He went to night school and became a real estate broker ( he still holds a license ) and quit Montgomery Ward . Some days he worked as a ships ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempted a third job : working for a private detective agency for 75 cents an hour . His sole experience had been his year as an oil inspector . His first assignment was to find out where a wealthy Oakland married man was living and what he was doing in a house in San Francisco . To find out , Pennington did what any other layman would do : parked near the house and waited . Soon a good-looking young woman drove into the basement garage and closed the doors . This occurred several times . Sometimes the car stayed in the garage a long time . She never parked on the street . " Being of an inquisitive nature I wondered why the car was being driven direct into the garage . I deducted there was some reason for that . I 've always maintained you 're either a natural for this business or you 'd just as well get out of it . " One day , following her car away from the house , Pennington saw a man get up out of the back seat . She took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avert suspicion Pennington first canvassed nearby homes for the names of the occupants , carrying a big black notebook and saying he worked for the City Directory ; then he called at the house the man had entered and thus identified him as the wealthy Oakland husband . That was all the agency had wanted him for . He got paid about $30. r on about a year he continued to work as a part-time real estate broker , part-time ships ' clerk , and part-time private eye . In 1937 a lawyer friend got him the job of hunting hidden assets . This paid $250 a month and lasted four months . When he ' eft he was a full-fledged private detective . This meant he had invested $70 in a bond and license , had listed himself in the phone book as a private detective , had had some cards and blotters printed , and was going around telling people he was a private detective . About once a week he called on all the Oakland attorneys listed in the telephone directory , working some office buildings from top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A COMPLETE DETECTIVE SERVICE WILLIAM V.

He had bought the movie camera to take pictures of his children . The address in Piedmont , an East Bay suburb , was the eight-room house which he occupies today . He still has no downtown office or secretary . His office is a former breakfast nook in his home with flowered wallpaper , a begonia plant , pictures of the children , a framed homily . His wife leaves the kitchen  --  they have no maid to answer the phone . A private detective has almost no capital investment . A file of city directories , a street guide , a couple of guns ( which he rarely carries ) , a car , a movie camera , a $10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets smashed too often for him to use an expensive one ) , a filing cabinet , a flashlight , a typewriter , a screwdriver , a notebook , a pencil , some stationery , perhaps a microphone  --  those , rather than such exotic items as fingerprint kits and disguises , are the only tools a shamus needs . " I felt if I could sell myself to the attorney he would then employ me . A man can pull himself up if he tries hard enough . " Attorneys began to use Pennington . His fee was $1.50 an hour plus expenses . He did a lot of personal injury work for the traction company  --  finding out whether persons who sued the company were faking their injuries . ( Such faking is a highly-organized racket in some cities . ) His first big case was a personal injury case for a powder company . Two miners had sued for $75,000 , claiming that explosives manufactured by the company had detonated prematurely , nearly blinding one man and crippling the leg and back of the other . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went there , got a room in the only hotel , and discovered they hung out in a bar across the street . As assistant he hired a man who was renowned for being able to drink anybody in the county under the table . Separately they went to the bar . Pennington drank cokes while his assistant bought drinks for the plaintiffs . Pennington 's assistant brought the " blinded " plaintiff to his table . Pennington began to read aloud a newspaper story about a $125,000 lawsuit ; interested , the " blinded " plaintiff finished reading the story , though the light was bad . The assistant later induced the two men to display their agility by sparring with him out on the sidewalk while Pennington surreptitiously took movies from his hotel room . Pennington 's assistant got the men drunk , and they told him how the " premature " explosion had been caused by their own carelessness . They passed out ; Pennington and his man took them to their room , where Pennington picked up damaging letters from their families . The suit was settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fertile field for a divorce lawyer or detective . New at the work , he toiled harder for a hundred dollars than he does today for a thousand . In 1942 , afraid the government was going to requisition all private cars , he sought a military commission , was refused , and went back to the waterfront as a ships ' clerk , for a private detective without a car is like a dentist without a drill . By the time this scare blew over , other private eyes had grabbed the warplant guard jobs , and attorneys for embittered wives and husbands were crying for a detective . It was then that Pen-nington moved across the Bay into San Francisco , into the big time . The UNO case made him . Today he is sitting pretty . When an expensive divorce lawyer thinks of a private detective he thinks of Peekaboo Pennington . Many more experienced operatives , now tagged as sabotage experts , face a reconversion problem . Attorneys value Pennington because he performs as well on the witness stand as in a love nest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlike many less lyric operatives , he writes an excellent report . This he attributes to the experience he gained as a Midwest columnist . Perhaps most important of all , says Jake Ehrlich , one of San Francisco 's highest-priced divorce lawyers , is Pennington 's ability to think like a lawyer . " He knows what evidence is , " Ehrlich had said . " He knows what a lawyer wants . Most detectives just follow a guy around . Pennington plans a campaign like a lawyer . " IV DROBABLY ninety per cent of divorce r work is shadowing . Police detectives employ two techniques : the loose tail , in which the operative risks losing his subject rather than be discovered , and the close tail , in which the detective follows the subject closely at any cost , including discovery . In divorce work the detective often must use the close technique , since the intimacies he hopes to observe are fugitive and can not be seen from long range . However , if the subject appears suspicious , the loose technique can be used , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to pick up , again if the operative loses him . Not all detectives can shadow people successfully . Pennington once tailed a man The Close Tail The Loose Tail intermittently for two years without being discovered . Shadowing requires judgment , fast thinking , a great deal of patience , and various special skills , such as recognizing a car at night from the rear by its tail light alone , or driving a car with great skill ; in following somebody through heavy traffic the detective must choose frequently between losing his subject at a red light or making himself conspicuous by running the light . Working on foot Pennington sometimes changes overcoats during the day but he does n't think this makes much difference ? " either you can shadow a man or you ca n't . " He never wears sun glasses , perhaps the amateur 's favorite disguise : they make one conspicuous . Patience is the tail man 's greatest ally . Frequently Pennington sits in his car outside a suspected love nest for a week , eight or ten hours a night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use . Sometimes Pennington spends half a foggy night crouched beneath a bedroom window to which he has affixed a microphone . He has never been caught at this . Yet , unlike fictional detectives , he is not infallible . Once a husband he was following spotted him , led him out into a country lane , made a fast U-turn , and bore down on Pennington 's car head on ; Pennington drove off through a walnut grove and , pursued hotly by the man he was supposed to be following , raced twenty tortuous miles before he was able to escape ignominiously in traffic . V I T MAY be interesting to watch Penning- ton in action . Late in 1945 Guy E. Ashley , a wealthy San Francisco undertaker , sued his wife for divorce . Mrs. Ashley 's attorney , Phil F. Garvey , called in Pennington , who interviewed Mrs. Ashley in her home . She said her husband had moved out and she thought he might be carrying on a liaison with another woman , though he was living with his mother . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with was his subject 's name , description , business address , mother 's home address , and the license number of his blue-green Oldsmobile sedan , 14 C 237 . Not much . But what he found out is unblushingly set forth among the hereinaboves and herein-afters of Mrs. Ashley 's cross-complaint in the divorce action . Here , in substance , is the story as disclosed in that document . On December 7 , 1945 , Pennington parked near the Ashley and McMullen Mortuary . When Ashley arrived , Pennington identified him from description  --  a big , well-dressed man of about fifty . Pennington studied the heavy traffic and the street layout . He found a way to park a block away so he could follow Ashley whatever way he went . At 3 P.M. Ashley came out and drove to Pinellis Flowerland a few blocks away , then went back to the mortuary . He stayed there till 5:10 when he emerged with a man , drove him to Second Avenue , and Patience . . : then drove to his mother 's home , a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half away and waited . Ashley did not come out by 8:30 , so Pennington called it a day . When Pennington arrived at the mortuary next morning Ashley 's car was not in sight , so Pennington phoned the mortuary , asked for Ashley , and was told he was due back at 1 P.M. Pennington attended to some other business and returned at about 12:30 . Ashley showed up at 12:55 . He went to a near-by delicatessen , and Pennington 's hopes rose : perhaps Ashley was going to take the afternoon off for a picnic . At 4:55 P.M. Ashley came out of the mortuary with an elderly woman . When Pennington followed them to 45 Sutro Heights he realized she was Ashley 's mother . At 6 P.M. they drove across Golden Gate Park , stopped at a drugstore , then proceeded southward . Pennington dropped them . Pennington , having cased the job , conferred with Mrs. Ashley . She said her husband usually took Thursday off . The following Thursday Pennington , after a twenty-mile drive , arrived at Ashley 's mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8:40 Ashley came out and drove to the mortuary . On the way he stopped at no less than six grocery stores , remaining in each only a few minutes , almost trotting in and out , driving away rapidly . He bought nothing . At 9:10 A.M. he walked to a barber shop . Pennington went to a caf ? from which he could watch the barber shop and ate a sandwich and a bowl of soup  --  for he did n't know when he might get another chance to eat . ( " When they get a barber to fix them all up they usually are going somewhere . " ) Ashley was well dressed in a brown mottled suit , blue overcoat , and gray hat . At 9:45 he went to his car , opened the glove compartment , then went into the mortuary . At 9:50 he drove to a grocery ; bought something , and took it back to the funeral home . At 11:25 he came out , backed his car around a corner , and headed downtown . After stopping at a liquor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial district . Presently a woman came out and got into his car . She was tall , good looking , well dressed , some ten years younger than Ashley . They drove down Bayshore High-way and stopped at the Alamo cocktail lounge . Pennington followed them inside ; they were at the bar ; Pennington stood around killing a few minutes , then went outside . He put the telephoto lens on his motion picture camera , parked his car at an angle at the curb beyond the parking lot , and waited . When the couple came out , Pennington photographed them . They went to Bay Meadows race track . In order not to lose them in the crowd when ? they bought tickets Pennington had to keep very close to them . " When you 're starting out in this business you 're apt to stay too far back and lose him ; just because you can see him you think he 'll see you . He wo n't . " He got a good look at the woman and jotted down her description-125 pounds , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose , about forty , wearing a leopard-skin fur coat of medium length , a rust-colored dress , black felt hat with gold sequins , black shoes , gold earrings . He stayed right on them as they moved through the crowd , made two-dollar bets , went up into the grandstand . Several times he took motion pictures of them from only fifteen feet away ; he would shoot out toward the track and people near him would crane their necks to see what could be going on between races ; but his subjects never spotted him . The sound of his camera was lost in the crowd . A few times they surveyed the crowd for familiar faces but they were not unduly suspicious . Once they split the bottle of whisky he had brought ; Pennington pocketed the near-empty bottle a moment after Ashley tossed it in a trash barrel . pc our 4:30 , to insure picking them up when they left , Pennington went to his car . He tailed them to Stockton and Pine in a neighborhood of expensive apartment buildings near Nob Hill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The woman opened the door to the lobby with her key . Here Pennington had to gamble . This apparently was her home but he did n't know her name . When they went through the door , he blocked it from closing with his foot . They got into the elevator . He shoved the door open , hurried inside , and bolted up the stairs , watching the elevator from floor to floor . Running out into the sixth floor corridor he almost bumped into them as they got out of the elevator . They stared at him . He walked past them , turned down a side corridor out of sight , and waited . If they came this way , he would have to knock on a door and have some story ready . If by ill chance he happened to pick on her door , his story would have to be a very good one indeed . But they went the other way ; he heard the door of an apartment beyond the elevator close . The apartment doors were of translucent glass . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of these two . Pennington went back downstairs and took up his vigil from the street . At 7:50 the lights in 603 went out ; a few minutes later Ashley and the woman came out and went to the car . Pennington was pretty sure 603 was her apartment . They went to a restaurant . Though hungry , Pennington was afraid to follow ; they might spot him this time . At 8:55 P.M. they drove past the San Francisco Yacht Harbor onto the Golden Gate Bridge ramp , circled Funston Avenue , drove through Golden Gate Park to Lincoln Way , and thence out to Robert 's Night Club , where the surf was plainly audible . Pennington picked up a folder advertising Robert 's and waited outside . He wanted to take a flash picture of their car but was afraid of attracting the attention of carhops . When the couple drove away , she sat so close to Ashley that her head covered the rear view mirror , which was a break for Pennington . They went back to her apartment . Pennington , waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute , then go out . It was 10:30 . Nobody came out . Pennington figured they would stay put for awhile . He went around to the rear but there was n't any unlocked back door as in most apartment buildings . He waited at the front untilanother tenant came out . Pennington went in . M. Collins was the name on the 603 mail box and buzzer button . He went out and took a time exposure of Ashley 's car . At 11:15 the lights went on in 603 . Fifty minutes later Ashley came out and drove away . Pennington got home about 12:45 , having tailed Ashley for more than eighteen hours . He marked the whisky bottle and night club folder for identification and got out his city directory . He found Mrs. Mollie F. Collins listed at 530 Stockton Street . Next day he made sure she was the woman in 603 by canvassing other tenants , posing as a city directory interviewer . S UNDAY night he made a spot check but the apartment was dark .

From the trunk of his car he took several packages , some wrapped as Christmas gifts ; then he went in . Pennington phoned Mrs. Ashley several times , could n't reach her , and left word for her to meet him on the street corner as soon as possible . He maintained his vigil . At 9:55 an Army officer and a woman emerged from the building . Ashley , in his shirtsleeves , and Mrs. Collins waved and called farewell to them from the window of 603 . Soon the lights went out . Presently Mrs. Ashley arrived , accompanied by her daughter and son-in-law . Pennington described the setup to them . Mrs. Ashley wanted to go in and break the door down . That was what Pennington had in mind . When a tenant came out , Pennington went in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobby while he went out and got his camera . Outside the door of 603 they paused . They could hear voices , a man 's and a woman 's . But Mrs. Ashley was almost sure the man 's voice was not her husband 's . Pennington was dumbfounded . Had he been following the wrong man all along ? They all stood in the corridor and watched and listened for more than an hour . According to Mrs. Ashley 's cross-complaint , this is what happened next : at five minutes to midnight they saw , through the translucent glass door , the figure of a nude woman . They heard the woman say , " Sweetheart  --  now I can call you sweetheart . " Again she crossed behind the door , this time wearing a robe . A few minutes later the door opened part way . Mrs. Ashley at once recognized her husband , dressed for the street . Pennington thrust the door wide open . Barefoot and clad in a white print robe , Mrs. Collins asked , " What are you doing in here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the employ of Mrs. Ashley . Ashley said , " Of Mrs. Ashley ? " Mrs. Ashley , according to her cross-complaint , ran at Mrs. Collins and pulled at her robe ; she was wearing nothing else . Mrs. Collins screamed , " Mrs. Ashley ! " Pennington was taking pictures with his flash camera . He asked Ashley " what sort of a party was going on , " and Ashley said , " Oh , a couple of friends just dropped in for a visit . " Mrs. Collins ran for the kitchen . Everybody ran around the apartment awhile : Mrs. Collins went to a corner and hid , Pennington took a picture of the rumpled bed , Ashley sat down in the breakfast nook , Pennington picked up a phone bill , some letters , a poem , and a " bottle-shaped package " which lay under the Christmas tree and bore a card " Holiday Wishes to Mollie from G , " and Mrs. Collins , sobbing , asked whether there would be any publicity . There was a scene between the Ashleys , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Pennington said , " Now , Mr. Ashley , if you will only keep your composure now and talk with your attorney in the morning it will be better all the way around . I have a job to do and I do n't propose to argue the merits with you . " Whereupon Ashley called Pennington a cheap detective , and Mrs. Collins said , " Please , Guy , do n't talk to this man like that , " and Pennington said , " I do n't mind , Mrs. Collins , I am used to it . " Such colloquies are not uncommon on Pennington 's raids . Pennington , perhaps out of a Kansas-bred distaste for this aspect of his work , usually explains apologetically that he is just earning a living . Once when he did this , the man cursed him , and Pennington knocked him down . V MHOUGH Pennington makes raids in less 1 than half his cases , it is his use of the raid that sets him apart from most private detectives and lands him so often on page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives him any resemblance to Sam Spade and other fictional detectives . Only in recent years has he employed it . He charges a special raid fee , and never makes a raid unless his client goes along , and never kicks in a door unless he is certain of what he will find behind it . Once a client asked Pennington to raid a house he was sure was occupied by his wife and another man ; Pennington , cautious , knocked first instead of kicking in the door ; it turned out the client had the wrong house . Here caution probably saved Pennington from a serious damage suit . But when he is certain of his ground Pennington does not hesitate . A raid puts the victim in such a hole that he dares not file charges against Pennington . A smash requires nice timing . Recently Ehrlich , the attorney , was asked what would happen if Pennington kicked in a door and found the man and woman fully clothed , playing checkers , and the bed unrumpled . Ehrlich replied , " Then he would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennington . " Pennington never carries a gun on a raid . He frequently takes along a husky assistant . During the war he had trouble getting help ; his raid men went to work in shipyards . Sometimes he takes his son , who used to be a University of California football player . Sometimes his wife goes too . Mrs. Pennington , an attractive , graying , happily-married woman , maintains a slightly superior attitude toward Penning-ton 's clients and victims . Except on raids Pennington rarely employs any other operative than her . She is useful as cover  --  a middle-aged couple is not suspect  --  and in other ways . She can follow a woman into a restroom ; if she and Pennington get into an elevator with a subject and Pennington calls a floor and the subject gets off first , Mrs. Pennington can get off with him and observe where he goes . No doubt all this would seem disgustingly folksy to a Hammett heel . But it works . Pennington has had one or more ribs broken on three raids . One time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder . When he broke down a door in one wild raid , the woman ran into a dark bathroom ; he had to force that door too , and she fought him . When he got her out , her lover took a swing at him . While they fought , the woman ran to the window and opened it and threw one leg over the ledge . Her lover yelled , " She 's going to jump . " " Let her jump , " Pennington said and grabbed the man . The woman reconsidered . By then one of Pennington 's ribs was broken . He got the third broken rib fighting the man who cursed him when he apologized for a raid . These have been Pennington 's only injuries while practicing his profession , although he has received a number of telephoned death threats . OME TIMES Pennington uses finesse , not 0 force , to gain entry . Once , working on a man with a tough reputation , he rang the buzzer of the love nest and told the man his wife had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the hall , his wife , Penning-ton 's operatives , and Penning-ton were waiting . He had a gun beneath his bathrobe . Pennington told him to put it down and , badly shaken , he did . Since then Pennington has asked his lady clients whether their husbands carry guns . The marital tangles of detective fiction end in devious murder . In reallife a cuckold usually either exterminates his wife and forthwith surrenders or else he hires a lawyer and a private detective ? and if he is the kind who hires a shamus he 's probably not the kind who murders . Nevertheless , Pennington 's raids have touched off free-for-all fights which frequently involve hair-pulling . Once Pennington took a client , another husband , to a small hotel where his wife was occupying a second-floor room with a man . The husband wanted to kill his rival . Pennington saw this was no time for a raid . He took the husband home , then drove around the corner and parked . The husband came out in a few minutes and got into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennington followed and parked where he could see into the room . The lights came on . Pennington could see the two men fighting . The husband threw his rival out the window . He landed on the sidewalk . As a crowd gathered , Pennington joined it . The man looked dead . But he was n't . Pennington tries to preserve an attitude of lofty neutrality in his cases . Nevertheless , perhaps because of his Midwest rearing , he can not always refrain from taking sides . Of one case he said righteously , " She broke up his first wife 's home to get him and now some other girl 's taking him away from her . So I do n't have too much sympathy for her . " He refuses to handle cases where either party is a friend of his . Some of his divorce clients have been reluctant to pay him . After one became reconciled with her husband , Pennington collected a 82,500 balance on a fee only by suing her and threatening to testify to what he had found when he kicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his clients sign contracts . " In this business you ca n't trust anybody , " Pennington says gently . " Not even your own clients . " This disenchanted conviction is about the only thing he has in common with Sam Spade .
