txt New York long has prided itself on being the most progressive state in the Union . That is precisely why the board of regents , top educational authority in the state , has run into trouble activating the state 's new Feinberg Law barring " subversive " teachers from the public schools . The law , passed by the Legislature last winter , went into effect July 1 , coincidental with the National Education Association 's vote in Boston against letting Communists teach in the public schools . On July 15 the regents issued the first rules attempting to assure teachers that they will get a fair trial and representation by counsel after they are dropped . But they put off until fall the publication of a list of subversive organizations , membership in which will constitute prima facie , but not conclusive , evidence of a teacher 's unfitness to hold a position . Under the law , the regents are required to issue a formal list of such organizations " after inquiry and after such notice and hearing as may be appropriate .

Most of those who made the three-hour trip from New York City for it were Communists , but also present were representatives of the Socialist Workers Party ( Trotskyite ) . the Industrial Workers of the World . the Independent Socialist League ( successor to the Workers Party ) , and the CIO Teachers Union . The first four groups were invited to appear because they are on Attorney General Tom Clark 's check list for federal loyalty tests under the heading , " Organizations which seek to alter the form of government in the United States by unconstitutional means . " If the attorney general had been present in Albany he might have got a new slant on his own list , which was made up without hearings . He undoubtedly would have found it hard to swallow the pleadings of Mrs. Lillian Gates , wife of one of the 11 Communists on trial at Foley Square , that " we Communists love our country " and her entreaties to " reject the idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dobbs , leading Trotskyite and archenemy of the Communists , sided with them in opposing the Feinberg Law .

" Two days later at a left-wing civil rights conference in New York City the Communists voted down civil rights for Mr. Dobbs and his Socialist Workers Party .

Thompson , who came from Chicago to say that the IWW , historically a troublemaker in the union field , was " being tried on a political issue when we are the world 's most nonpolitical organization . " Mr. Thompson said he had written the attorney general to find out just what the charges were against the IWW , but had not been favored with a reply . Out of his pocket he pulled a copy of a 1927 Supreme Court decision , Fiske vs . Kansas , which he said completely vindicated the IWW of charges that it wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hal Draper said : " Where the possibility exists of converting the majority of people who unfortunately still believe in capitalism to the viewpoint of socialism , it would not only be incorrect , it would be utterly senseless , for a Socialist to advocate overthrow of the government by force , violence , or unlawful means . " At the end of the hearing all the groups were given time to file briefs , and the regents indicated they would put off the publication of their " subversive list " until September . Meanwhile , they have gone ahead with the second part of their instructions to provide machinery for the removal of any teacher , superintendent , or other employee of the school system who utters " any treasonable or seditious word " or who does " any treasonable or seditious act or acts .

" With New York estimated to have 40 per cent of the Communists in the United States , it is not surprising that the state is hearing plenty of abuse of the Feinberg Law these days , and not everyone who is attacking it is a Communist . There is a great deal of concern that it will pit teacher against teacher and tend to intimidate them by putting them at the mercy of the most prejudiced people in their communit y . Some persons think it will be impossible to administer the Feinberg Law fairly . The regents , charged with the duty , are proceeding cautiously and wisely . It all shows how easy it is to pass anti-Communist resolutions in convention , as the NEA did in Boston , and how much more difficult it is to preserve the democratic way in putting them into effect .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
