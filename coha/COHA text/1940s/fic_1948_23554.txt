Catalina A Novel in Three Parts . Part II W. Somerset Maugham In the first installment of this miracle story  --  set in the town of Castel Rodriguez in sixteenth-century Spain  --  a crippled girl of sixteen named Catalina Perez was coming out of church when a kindly lady in a blue cloak spoke to her , and told her that she could be healed by " the son of Juan Suarez de Valero who has best served God . " Catalina became convinced that the lady was the Blessed Virgin . Now there were three sons of Juan Suarez de Valero . One was a bishop , Blasco , who believed that it was God 's will that he should become an Inquisitor , and therefore had killed and tortured heretics and unbelievers . Another was a great soldier , Manuel , who had been merciless in war . The third , Martin , was a humble baker who had married beneath him . When the report of Catalina 's vision spread widely , almost everyone assumed that " the son of Juan Suarez de Valero who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bishop ; and the Bishop himself , persuaded by the Prioress and by a miracle that he took to be a sign from God , decided to attempt the cure the following day . But Catalina 's wise uncle Domingo , a toper , scholar , and playwright , feared that the Virgin 's words had been misinterpreted ; he tried to reach the Bishop to warn him , only to be turned away at the Bishop 's door . XIV T T BREAK of day , three Dominican friars with their hoods drawn over their shaven heads slipped out of the con-vent . But though it was so early there was al-ready a little crowd at the convent gate . In the tall cowled figure between the other two they at once recognized the saintly Bishop . The three friars , followed at a respectful dis-tance by the curious , walked swiftly to the Carmelite church . Here more persons were waiting . One of the friars knocked at the door . It was opened just enough to let them pass through one after the other and closed behind them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked and though they knocked , they knocked in vain . Catalina was waiting in the Lady Chapel . Maria Perez and Domingo had accompanied hcr , but had been refused admittance . Dona Beatriz received the Bishop at the church door with her nuns . The Bishop , with his two attendants , went into the sacristy and donned the sacred vestments . They walked slowly to the Lady Chapel . The nuns were on their knees . Catalina , supporting herself on her crutch , knelt at the foot of the altar steps . The Bishop said Mass . The nuns joined in the responses in awed undertones . He administered Holy Communion to Catalina . After the benediction and the reading of the Last Gospel he knelt at the altar and prayed in silence . Then he rose to his feet and , his great tragic eyes upon Catalina , walked down the steps . He placed his thin , brown hand on her head . " I , the unworthy instrument of the Most High , in the name of the Father , the Son , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and walk . " He had begun tremulously , in so low a voice that the nuns could hardly hear , but he spoke the last words loud and clear in a tone of command . Catalina , her face pale with emotion , her eyes shining , raised herself to her feet , cast the crutch aside , took a step forward , and with a cry of anguish crashed to the floor . The miracle had failed . immediately there arose a hubbub among the nuns . Some of them screamed , two of them fainted . The Prioress stepped forward . She gave Catalina a glance and then her eyes met the Bishop 's . For a while they gazed intently at one another . Behind them the nuns were sobbing . Then the Bishop walked out of the chapel , the two friars at his heels , and returned to the sacristy . He did not utter a word . The Bishop , his cowl once more over his head , walked out of the church into the sunlight of the summer morning . The news had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the windows in the plaza were crowded with spectators . They were thick on the church steps and the square was filled with them . For a moment the Bishop was dismayed to see that great throng , but only for a moment ; he pulled his habit close to him and drew himself up . In some strange way , he no sooner appeared than a shudder of consternation passed through the crowd . They knew at once , though they could not have said how , that the miracle had failed . XV T ETE friars of the Dominican convent had been angered because the Bishop had refused to allow them to attend the ceremony , and when , with his two attendants , he returned to it they were loitering about to look at him . The news had already reachedthem . He passed as though he did not see them . When the Bishop entered his cell he sank onto the hard wooden stool and stared at the stone floor . Slow , painful tears trickled down his sunken cheeks . Father Antonio 's heart was filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He whispered to his companion who forthwith left the cell and in a few minutes returned with a bowl of soup . When the Bishop had eaten , Father Antonio put aside the bowl , and still on his knees , ventured to take his hand . " Do not take it so hard , Sefton The girl was deceived by demons . " " No , the fault was mine . I asked for a sign and the sign was given me . In my vainglory I thought myself not unfit to do what is vouchsafed to the saints whom God has chosen for His own . I am a sinner and I am justly punished for my presumption . " The Bishop was so broken that the friar dared to speak to him as otherwise he would never have done . We are all sinners , Sefior , but I have been privileged to live close to you for many years and no one knows better than I your unfailing kindness to all men , your ceaseless charity , and your loving kindness . " " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father Antonio gazed with pity on the Bishop 's agonized face . He still held his cold , emaciated hand . " Would it not distract your mind if I read to you a little , my Lord ? " he said after a pause . " Read , my son . I will listen . " F ATHER Antonio , not without tact , had chosen to read his own account of the great auto da fe , which had been the crown of Friar Blasco 's career in the Holy Office , and which , as before mentioned , had given so much pleasure to the Prince , now Philip III , and had in due course been at least the occasion for the saintly Inquisitor 's elevation to the important See of Segovia . The impressive ceremony , devised to inspire awe for the authority of the Inquisition and edify the people , took place on a Sunday so that none should have an excuse not to attend it , since to do so was a pious duty ; and to secure as large an attendance as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came . One of the duties of the inquisitors was to visit during the night those condemned to death by fire at the stake , inform each of his sentence , and prepare him to meet his God . Friar Blasco was of course among those assigned to this grim errand . Dawn broke and Mass was celebrated in the audience chamber of the Holy Office . Breakfast was given to the prisoners and they were then ranged in order according to the gravity of their offense against the Faith , and a procession was formed . Those who were to die , dressed in yellow tunics and carrying yellow candles , were accompanied by the friars who had been with them throughout the night . It was a fine , sunny day , the sort of day that elates the heart of young and old so that they feel it good to be alive . The procession moved slowly through the tortuous streets , the.teeming crowd held back by a railing , till it reached the plaza . There was a vast concourse . The windows of the surrounding houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his suite watched from a balcony in the town hall . All of the culprits were required to sit attentively upon a stage while a long sermon was preached and the advantages of the true faith made abundantly clear . Then the sentences were read and the culprits were delivered over to the secular arm . The Holy Office rendered no judgment that involved the shedding of blood and indeed went so far as to urge the civil authorities to spare the life of the criminal . These last , however , were required by the canon law promptly to punish the heretics and an indulgence was accorded to the pious who contributed wood to the bonfire that was to burn them . This ended the work of the inquisitors and they retired . The soldiers of the Zarza then surrounded the prisoners and marched with them to the place of execution to protect them from the fury of the populace , who in their hatred of heresy would otherwise ill-treat and sometimes even kill them . The friars attended them and strove to the end to bring about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women whose beauty excited the admiration of all , an impenitent Dutch merchant who had been caught smuggling into the countrya Spanish translation of the New Testament , a Moor convicted of killing a chicken by cutting off its head , a bigamist , a merchant who had harbored a fugitive from the Holy Office , and a Greek found guilty of holding opinions condemned by the Church . The quernadero or burning place was outside the city . Garrotes were attached to the stakes so that those who had professed a desire to die in the Christian faith , and even those who did so at the last moment , might be spared death by fire and killed by the more merciful method of strangulation . There was a vast multitude to watch the final scene . It was of course a sight even more thrilling than a bullfight , and the spectators had the satisfaction of knowing that they were performing an act of piety and a service to God . Those who were to be garroted were garroted and then the flames were kindled and the quick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might . perish forever . The crowd shouted and clapped their hands as the flames soared so that the shrieks of the victims were almost drowned , and here and there a woman broke into a shrill wailing chant to the Blessed Virgin or to the crucified Christ . Night fell and the crowd streamed back into the city , tired with long standing and the excitement , but feeling that they had had a happy day . They flocked to the taverns and the brothels did a roaring trade . A r.r .. this then , giving dramatic emphasis to the most significant episodes , Father Antonio read to the despondent Bishop in a loud , sonorous voice . His main object was to dispel the somber fancies of his revered and beloved superior by reminding him of the most glorious incident of his career . Therefore he was aghast when he looked up to see that tears were coursing down the Bishop 's cheeks and that his hands were clenched to control the sobbing that tore his breast . He threw aside his manuscript and jumping up from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My lord , what is it ? " he cried . " What have I done ? " The Bishop thrust him aside and rising to his feet stretched out his arms in supplication to the black Cross on the wall . " The Greek , " he moaned . " The Greek . " And then able to contain himself no longer he broke into passionate weeping . The Bishop with the palm of his hand impatiently brushed the tears from his eyes . " I am to blame , " he moaned , " terribly to blame . I have committed a fearful sin and my only hope of forgiveness is in the infinite mercy of God . " " My lord , for God 's sake explain . The Greek ? Why does your lordship speak of the Greek ? He was a heretic and suffered the just punishment of his crime . " " You do not know of what you speak . You do not know that my crime is greater than his . I asked for a sign and the sign was given me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; now I know it was a mark of His wrath . It is right that I should be humbled in the eyes of men , for I am a miserable sinner . " The Greek of whom they spoke , Demetrios Christopoulos , was a native of Cyprus , a man of some property , which had enabled him to devote himself to learning . When the Turks , under Selim II , invaded the island in 1571 , he fled and managed to escape to Italy . In an evil hour he attracted the attention of a Spanish nobleman who had succumbed to the fashionable cult of Plato . The nobleman took him into his palace and they read together the immortal dialogues of the philosopher , After some years , however , he was recalled to Spain and he persuaded the Greek to go with him . When the nobleman died the Greek , almost an old man by then , found a modest dwelling in the house of a widow woman . He had acquired some reputation for his learning and eked out a meager living by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Demetrios and sent for him . He was pleased with the old man 's gentle bearing and asked if he would teach him the language in which the New Testament was written so that he might read the words with greater devotion . For nine years the Inquisitor and the Greek worked together . Friar Blasco was an industrious and an apt pupil and after nine months the Greek , who had a passion for the great and ancient literature of his country , persuaded him to embark on the works of the classical writers . Demetrios was a fervent Platonist and it was not long before they were reading the dialogues . From them they went on to Aristotle . It was a new world Friar Blasco thus entered and he felt a singular exultation in hisperusal of these great works and a blissful repose after the labors of the day . In their long and fruitful intercourse he had conceived something very like affection for the unworldly Greek and his simple decent life , his kindliness and charity , increased his admiration for his character . I T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Lutheran , arrested by the Inquisition for bringing into Spain translations of the New Testament , admitted under ' torture that he had given a copy to the Greek . Under questioning , emphasized by another turn of the rack , he stated that they had often conversed on religion and on many points were in full agreement . This was enough to oblige the Holy Office to make an investigation . When Friar Blasco read the final reports he was horrified . It had never occurred to him that the Greek , so good , so humble , had not during his long years in Spain embraced the Catholic faith of Rome . Witnesseswere brought forward who swore that they had heard him utter the most damnable heresies . He rejected the supremacy of the Pope and though he venerated the Virgin he denied her immaculate conception . The woman of the house in which he lived had heard him say that indulgences were worthless and someone else testified that he did not accept the Roman doctrine of purgatory . Friar Blasco 's fellow inquisitor , Don Baltasar de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long sharp nose , tight lips , and small restless eyes . When the damning facts were laid before him he insisted on the Greek 's arrest , even though Friar Blasco protested as much as his conscience would permit . When the old man was taken to the prison he freely admitted the charges . The offense was grave , but the evidence of Protestantism was not decisive and in order to give the Greek a chance Friar Blasco urged that to induce his conversion and so save his soul he should be put to the torture . The Greek was brought in , stripped , and tied to the trestle . His feeble old body was emaciated . He was solemnly besought to tell the truth for the love of God since the inquisitors did not wish to see him suffer . He remained silent . His ankles were tied to the sides of the rack , cords were passed round his arms , his thighs and his calves , and their ends were attached to a garrote , a stick by which they could be twisted tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Greek shrieked , another , and skin and muscle were cut through to the bone . On account of his great age Friar Blasco had insisted that not more than four turns should be given since , though six or seven were possible , it was unusual even with strong men to exceed five . The Greek begged them to kill him at once and put him out of his agony . Though Friar Blasco was forced to be there , he was not forced to look and he stared at the stone floor , but those shrieks of pain rang in his ears and tore his nerves to pieces . That was the voice with which his friend had recited those grave and noble passages of Sophocles ; that was the voice with which with an emotion he could hardly control he had read the dying speech of Socrates . Before each turn of the garrote , the Greek was ordered to tell the truth , but he clenched his teeth and would not speak . When he was released from the rack he could not stand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holy Office . Though he had admitted nothing he was condemned on the strength of what he had previously confessed . Friar Blasco could do nothing more , but still the shrieks of the old man rang in his ears and he suffered without respite . He sent spiritual advisers to attempt his conversion , for though nothing now could save his life , repentance , allowing him to be strangled quickly at the stake by the garrote , might still spare him the agony of death by burning . But the Greek was contumacious . Notwithstanding the torture and his long confinement in prison his mind remained clear and active . To the friars ' arguments he answered with arguments so subtle that they were incensed . O N the eve of the auto da fe , Friar Blasco decided to do an unprecedented thing . An hour before dawn he went to the Greek 's dungeon . Two friars were passing his last night on earth with him . Friar Blasco dismissed them . " He has refused to listen to our exhortations , " said one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they left the cell . " Your friars are doubtless worthy men , Sefior , " he said . " But their intelligence is not remarkable . " He was caIm and though so frail and old maintained an appearance of dignity . " Your Reverence will forgive me if I remain on my bed . The torture left me very weak and I wish to preserve my strength for this day 's ceremonies . " " Let us not waste time in idle speeches . In a few hours you must face a dreadful fate . God knows I would gladly give ten years of my life to save you from it . The evidence was damning and I should have been false to my oath if I had failed in my duty . " " I am the last man who would wish you to do that . " " Your life is forfeit and that I can not save . But if you will recant and accept conversion I can at least spare you the agony of the flames . I have loved you , Demetrios , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving your immortal soul . " " You will only be wasting your time , Sefior . We would employ it to better advantage if we talked as we have so often done before of the death of Socrates . " " I do not command you now , Demetrios , I beseech you to listen to me . " " That last courtesy I am hound to grant you . " The Inquisitor in earnest tones , with learning and discretion , point by point , expounded the arguments which the Church had devised to substantiate her own claims and to refute the opin ions of heretics . He was w ell accustomed to discourse of this nature and he expressed himself ably and with impressive conviction . " I should deserve little respect if for fear of a dreadful death I pretended to accept beliefs which I think erroneous , " said the Greek when he had finished . " I do not ask you to do that . I ask you to believe the truth with all your heart . " " ' What is truth ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his belief as he can constrain the sea to calm when stormy winds assail it . I thank Your Reverence for your kindness and believe me I hear you no ill will for the misfortune that has befallen me . You have acted according to your conscience and no man can do more . I am an old man and whether I die today or in a year or two is no great matter . I have only one request to make you . Do not because I am gone relinquish your studies of the sublime literature of ancient Greece . It can not fail to enlarge your spirit and ennoble your mind . " " Do you not fear the just vengeance of God ? " " God has many names and infinite attri-butes . " " I can not leave you thus . " " You will do your part and I mine , " Greek smiled . " It is yours to kill , mine to without quailing . " M UCH of this , in halting tones , the Bishop told the two friars and at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shame greater than lie could bear . " Then I did a dreadful thing . I could not bear the thought of that poor old man 's being burnt by those cruel flames . His screams when they tortured him still rang in my ears and I thought I should continue to hear them all my life . I announced that he had so far recanted as to accept the procession of the Holy Ghost . I gave orders that he should be garroted before he was burnt . I knew it was a sin . It was a sin for which I can never cease to reproach myself , and the events of this day are my punishment . " " But , my lord , it was an act of mercy , " said Father Antonio . " It was no act of mercy . Who knows but that the Greek was shaken by my reasoning and when the fire licked his naked flesh the grace of God might have been vouchsafed to him and so moved his stubborn spirit to recant his errors ? Many at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maker have thus saved their souls . I robbed him of the chance and so condemned him to eternal torment . " It is to an eternity of hideous suffering that I have condemned that unhappy man . What punishment can make amends for such a frightful misdeed ? Oh , I am afraid , afraid . " Great sobs rent his breast . " Call the friars together and I will tell them I have sinned and for my soul 's sake command them to inflict upon me the circular discipline . " This was the degrading punishment of scourging in which all present used the lash on the offender . Father Antonio , appalled , flung himself down on his knees and with his hands together as if in prayer implored his master not to insist on such a fearful ordeal . " The brethren have no love for you , my lord , they are angry because you would not allow them to come to the church this morning . They will not spare you . " " I do not wish them to spare me . If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised himself to his feet . " My lord , you have no right to expose yourself to such a mortal affront . You are the Bishop of Segovia . You will cast a slur on the whole episcopate of Spain . " The Bishop was taken aback . Was there some shadow of vainglory in his desire thus publicly to abase himself ? " I do not know , " he said at last miserably . " I am like a man stumbling across an unknown country in the darkness of the night . Perhaps you are right . I was thinking only of myself , I did not think how it would affect others . " Father Antonio gave a sigh of relief . " You two shall give me the discipline here and in private . " " No , no , no , I will not . I could not bear to do violence to your sacred body . " " Must I remind you of your vows then , " asked the Bishop with all his old sternness . " Have you so little love for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on me for my soul 's good ? There are scourges under the bed . " Silently , unhappily , the friar got them out . They were stained with blood . The Bishop slipped out of the upper part of his habit so that it fell to his waist . Then he removed his shirt ; it was made of tin and pierced like a grater so that it should lacerate the flesh . He threw his arms round a thin column and exposed his back to the two friars . Each of them in silence took a scourge and one after the other brought it down on the bleeding flesh . At each blow the Bishop shuddered , but not even a groan escaped his lips . They had not given him more than a dozen strokes when he fell to the floor in a swoon . They picked him up and carried him to the hard bed . At length he opened his eyes . It took him a moment to gather his senses together . Then he forced a smile to his lips . " Poor creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fainted . " " Do not speak , my lord . Lie still . " Father Antonio had sent for a doctor who came at last . He ordered the patient to stay in bed and said he would send medicine . It was a soothing potion and after a while the Bishop fell asleep . XVI T owAito evening of the next day , his brother Don Manuel came to see him . He came in , very grandly dressed , ple-thoric , rudely healthy , and with an aggressive vitality . He smiled grimly when he looked round the bare and cheerless cell . The Bishop motioned him to a stool , and he came directly to the point . " It appears that the ceremony of yesterday morning failed to realize your hopes . " " Be so good as to state your business , Manuel . " " What made you think that you were the chosen instrument to cure that girl of her dis-ability ? " " I received an assurance that what the girl said was true and , though I knew myself unworthy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You made a mistake , brother . You should have examined her more carefully . The Blessed Virgin told her that the son of Don Juan de Valero who had best served God had the power to cure her . Why did you jump to the conclusion that you were meant ? " The Bishop paled . " What do you mean ? " he cried . " She said to me that Our Lady had told her that it was I. " She is an ignorant and foolish girl . She supposed that you must be designated because you are a bishop and , how I know not , the people of this city have heard much of your sanctity and mortifications . " The Bishop prayed a short mental prayer so that he could master the anger and shame with which his brother 's words filled him . " How do you know all this ? Who told you that those were the words of the Blessed Vir-gin ? " Don Manuel chortled at what seemed to him an excellent joke . " It appears that the girl has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him when we were little . If I remember right you were at the seminary with him . " The Bishop inclined his head in token of assent . " Domingo Perez is a toper . He goes to a tavern frequented by my servants and he scraped acquaintance with them , doubtless in the hope of drinking wine at their expense . Last night he was in his cups . As was natural they were all talking of the events of the morning , for your fiasco , brother , is become the common talk of the city . Domingo told them that lie had expected nothing else and had sought to warn you , but was refused admission to the convent . He repeated then the exact words as his niece had reported them to him which Our Blessed Lady had spoken . " Don Manuel continued softly , " Did it not occur to you , brother , that it was I who was meant ? " " You ? " " Does it surprise you , brother ? For four and twenty years I have served my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stake , and I , to the glory of God , have killed the damned heretics by the thousands . To the glory of God I have laid waste their fields and burnt their crops . I have besieged thriving towns and when they surrendered put all their inhabitants , men , women , and children , to the sword . " The Bishop shuddered . " The Holy Office condemns the accused only by process of law . It gives them the opportunity to repent and purge their sin . It is careful to do justice and if it punishes the guilty it absolves the innocent . " " I know those Dutchmen too well to think they are capable of repentance . Heresy is in their blood . No one that knows me can deny that I have served God well . " The Bishop pondered . " Heaven knows , I am conscious of my unworthiness , " he said at last gently . " Should you attempt this thing and fail it will cause a scandal in the city and give a cruel opportunity to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rashly ; it is a matter that demands anxious considera-tion . " " That it has already received , brother , " said Don Manuel coolly . " I have consulted my friends and they are the most important men in the city . / have asked the opinion of the archpriest and the prior of this convent . One and all , they consent . " Again the Bishop paused . He knew that there were many in the city who were envious of the positions he and his brother had achieved because , though gentlemen by birth , they were of small account . It might well be that they had agreed to his brother 's preposterous demand only to throw discredit on them both . " You must not forget that there is still the possibility that the girl Catalina Perez was deceived . " " The proof of the pudding is in the eating . If I fail it will be clear that the girl is a witch and should be handed over to the Inquisition for trial and punishment . " " If you have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the attempt I can do nothing to prevent you . But I beg you to do everything as secretly as may be so that greater scandal than has been caused already may be avoided . " Upon this Don Manuel withdrew . The Bishop sighed deeply . It seemed to him that his cup of bitterness was filled to the brim . He knelt down before the black Cross on the wall and silently prayed . Then he called a lay brother and bade him fetch the man Domingo Perez . XVII A FTER a little the lay brother ushered Domingo into the Bishop 's oratory . For a while the two men stared silently at one another . They had not met since they were young men , hardly more than boys , at the seminary of Alcala de Henares . Domingo wore a shabby cassock , green with age and stained down the front with wine and food . " Your lordship desired to see me , " he said . A slight , yet gentle smile was outlined on the Bishop 's pale lips . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do-mingo . " " Our paths have gone very different ways . I should have thought your lordship had long forgotten the existence of so poor and worthless a creature as Domingo Perez . " " We have known one another all our lives . I am ashamed that you should address me with such ceremony . It is many years since I have heard a friend call me Blasco . " Domingo gave him his careless , disarming smile . " The great have no friends , dear Blasco . It is the price they must pay for their greatness . " " Let us for an hour forget this poor greatness of mine and let us talk with one another like the old and intimate comrades we once were . I have kept myself informed of your life . " " It has not been an edifying one . " The Bishop sat down on a stool and motioned to Domingo to take the other . " But snore than that I have kept in touch with you through your letters . " " How can you have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not as from yourself , but I read too many of the poems you wrote when we were boys together not to know your handwriting . Do you think I did not recognize it in the letters my father and my brother Martin sent me . I knew very well that they could never have expressed themselves with such elegance and propriety . And there were expressions , turns of phrase , reflections , in which I recognized your wayward spirit . " Domingo laughed lightly . " How sad it is that you should have let your great gifts run to waste , Domingo . Often you used to terrify me by the audacity of your thought , but I never doubted your brilliance . You were horn to excel and but for your restless temper you might by now be a shining ornament of our Holy Church . " " Instead of which , " returned Domingo , " I am nothing but a poor scholar , a playwright who can find no actors to act his plays , a hack who writes sermons for priests too stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ne'er-do-well . I lacked the vocation , my good Blasco . Life allured me . My place was neither the cloister nor the hearth , but the broad highway with its adventures and perils , its chance encounters and manifold variety . I have lived . I have suffered from hunger and thirst , I have been footsore , I have been beaten , I have suffered every mischance that can beset a man : I have lived . And even now when age is creeping upon me I have no regrets for the years I have wasted , for I too have slept on Parnassus ; and when I walk to some distant village to write a paper for an illiterate clown , or when I sit in my little room surrounded by my books and rhyme the speeches in plays that will never be played , I am filled with such exultation that I would not change places with cardinal or pope .

So long as you say nothing to offend the Faith say what you will . " " Then this must he my answer : We know that the attributes of God are infinite and it has always seemed strange to me that men have never given Him credit for common sense . It is hard to believe that He would have created so beautiful a world if He had not desired men to enjoy it . Would He have given the stars their glory , the birds their sweet song , and the flowers their fragrance if He had not wished us to delight in them ? I have sinned before men and men have condemned me . God made me a man with the passions of a man and did He give them to inc only that I should suppress them ? He gave me my adventurous spirit and my love of life . I have a humble hope that when I am face to face with my Maker He will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight . " T i it : Bishop looked sorely troubled . He could have told the poor poet that we are placed on this earth to scorn its de-lights , to resist temptation , to conquer ourselves , and to bear our cross ; so that in the end , miserable sinners though we be , we may be found worthy of communion with the blessed . But would his words avail ? He could only pray that before death claimed him the Grace of God might descend upon that wretched man so that he would repent of his misdeeds . Silence fell between them . " I did not send for you today in order to urge you to mend your ways , " said the Bishop at last . " It would not be difficult for me to confute your wrongful opinions , but I know of old how ingenious you are to make the worse appear the better reason . You have a niece . " " I have .

" " She told me that Our Lady had named me . " " That was a natural error for a girl to make who had heard of your mortifications , virtue , and austerity . The Blessed Virgin told her that the power to cure her lay in the hands of that one of your father 's sons who has best served God . " " I have but just heard that . " " Do you not know then who has done that ? It is as plain as plain can be . " The Bishop paled . He gave Domingo an anxious glance . " My brother Martin ? " " The baker . " Beads of sweat stood on the Bishop 's brow . He shivered . " It is impossible . " " Why ? Because he has no learning ? Your brother is a good and simple man . He has been a faithful husband to his wife and a loving father to his children . He has honored his father and mother . He has fed them when they were hungry and tended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father 's contempt and his mother 's distress because , a gentleman by bird ' ' , he followed a calling that lowered him in the estimation of fools . He suffered with good humor the scorn of the gentry and the gibes of the vulgar . Like our father Adam he earned his bread by the sweat of his brow and he took a modest pride in the knowledge that the bread was good . He accepted the joys of life with gratitude and its sorrows with resignation . He succored the needy . He was pleasant in his discourse and cheerful in his mien . He was a friend to all men . " The ways of God are inscrutable and it may well be that in His eyes by his industrious , honest life , his loving kindness , his innocent gaiety , Martin the baker has served Him better than you who have sought salvation by prayer and penance or your brother Manuel who glories in the women and children he has killed and the thriving towns he has left in desolate ruin . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know me too well , Domingo , " he said , his voice trembling , " to think that I undertook to do the thing I did without anxious searching of heart . I knew I was unworthy and my soul was dismayed , but I took the sign that was granted me as a command to do what I believed to be the will of God . I was wrong . And now my brother Manuel is determined to attempt what I failed to do . " " At all costs you must prevent him . " " I have no authority to do so . " " If your brother should persist in his folly he will seek to avenge himself for his discomfiture on that wretched girl . The people will side with him . They will have no mercy . In the name of our old friendship I beseech you to protect her from his enmity and from the blind violence of the mob . " " By the Cross on which Our Lord was crucified I swear to you that I will give my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Domingo rose to his feet . " I thank you with all my heart . Farewell , my dear . Our paths are different and we shall not meet again . Farewell forever . " " Farewell . Oh , Domingo , I am an unhappy man . Pray for me , pray for me in all your prayers that God may vouchsafe to release me from the cruel burden of this life . " He was so shattered , his mien so piteous , that the old toper was seized with compassion . On a sudden impulse lie took the Bishop in his arms and kissed him on both cheeks . The sinner pressed the saint to his heart and was quickly gone . XVIII W HETHER the notion was born in a single place and spread swiftly from there , or whether it sprang independently into the minds of many at once , the conviction spread very swiftly through the city that Don Manuel was in reality the man intended to work the miracle ordained by the divine will . Wherever the subject was broached , and indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in palace and cloisters , it was agreed without the least dissent that the soldier was obviously chosen . A deputation , consisting of prominent ecclesiastics , members of the aristocracy , and persons of authority in the city council , called upon him and announced their unanimous opinion . Don Manuel in his Wolf . soldierlyway told them that he was prepared to put himself at their disposal . And so , on the following morning , Catalina Perez knelt trembling beside her crutch at the altar of the Collegiate Church . The Church was packed with humanity , some in glittering dress and some in the rags of poverty , and outside , in the plaza and in the streets leading to it , thousands pressed forward listening to the faint music of the Mass . When the great moment came , Don Manuel rose to his feet and strode to the terrified girl . He was confident in his power . He laid his hand on the girl 's head and in a loud voice , as though he were giving his regiment the order to charge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In the name of God the Father , God the Son , and God the Holy Ghost I command thee , Catalina Perez , to rise to thy feet , cast away thy useless crutch , and walk . " The girl , spellbound by the awfulness of the occasion , frightened , staggered to her feet and dropped the crutch . She took a step forward and with a cry of terror fell headlong . Once more the miracle had failed . T HEN a great uproar arose and it was as though a sudden madness had seized the crowd . Men shouted and women screamed . They yelled with rage . " A witch . A witch , " they cried . " The stake . The stake . The stake . Burn her . " Then with a sudden impulse the great throng surged toward the sacristy and they would have torn the girl limb from limb . The Bishop sprang to his feet and with a swift sweeping movement strode down the sacristy till he came face to face with the raging mob . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes blazed . " Back , back , " he cried in a voice of thunder . " Who are you to desecrate this holy place ? Get back , I tell you . Get back . " His aspect was so terrifying that a gasp of horror was wrung from a thousand throats . As though a great abyss had suddenly opened before them the crowd on a sudden stopped dead . They shrank back . For a moment the Bishop eyed them with eyes black with indignation . " Kneel , kneel , " he cried , " and pray that you may be forgiven for the insult that you have offered to the house of God . " At his words , dominated by his authority , many fell sobbing to their knees . Silence fell except for the hysterical sobbing of a woman here and there . " Listen , " said the Bishop at last . " You know the words Our Lady vouchsafed to the girl Catalina Perez and you know the wonders that have occurred in this city and have given rise to confusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl that the son of Don Juan de Valero who had best served God bad the power by God 's grace to cure her of her infirmity . In our sinful pride and vanity I who speak to you and Don Manuel my brother had the temerity to think that one or other of us was thus designated . We have been bitterly punished for our presumption . But Don Juan has still another son . " MAGAZINE The crowd interrupted him with shouts and laughter . " El panadero , " they cried . " The baker . " Then they began to sing derisively in a sort of rude rhythm . " El panadero . El panadero . " " Silence , " cried the Bishop . People hushed one another . " Are the familiars of the Holy Office here ? " Behind the Bishop several men spoke up . " Let them stand forth , " he said . There was a moment 's pause while they left their seats and took up positions behind the Bishop . " Listen , " he said again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It administers justice to the guilty , but is merciful to the repentant sinner . " He paused and the silence was awful . " If this wretched girl is deceived or is possessed of a devil it is for the Holy Office to take cognizance of it . If she fails in the test the familiars are here to deliver her to the tribunal . But the test is not complete . Where is Martin de Valero ? " " Here , here , " cried several voices . " Let him come forward . " T HE crowd parted and Martin was urged forward to the sanctuary steps . The men fell back and left him standing alone . He had come in from his shop to see the wonder of which everyone was talking and he was in his working clothes . His face was red from the heat of the ovens . The day was hot and pearls of sweat stood on his forehead . His plump good-humored countenance was heavy with consternation . " Come , " said the Bishop . " How can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am but a working man and no better a Christian than my neighbor . " " Be silent . " Catalina was lying where she had fallen , her face hidden in her arms and sobs shook her body . No one had paid more attention to her than if she were a dead dog by the roadside . Two familiars raised her to her feet and brought her face to face with the Bishop . As best she could , with the crutch under her armpit , she joined her hands together in supplication . Tears streamed down her face . " Oh , my lord , my lord , have pity on me , " she cried . " Not again , I beseech you . it can come to nothing . Let me go home to my mother . " " Kneel , " he ordered . " Kneel . " With a despairing sob the child sank to her knees . " Lay your hand on her head , " he bade his brother . " I can not . I will not . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T command you to do as I tell you , " said the Bishop harshly . A shudder shook the unfortunate man , for he knew that his brother would not hesitate to carry into effect his dreadful threat . He timidly laid a trembling hand on the girl 's head . It was not even clean . " Now say the words that you heard your brother Manuel say . " " I can not remember them . " " Then I will say them and you shall say them after me . I , Martin de Valero , son of Juan de Valero . " Martin repeated the words . " I , Martin de Valero , son of Juan de Valero . " The Bishop spoke the last fateful words in a loud strong voice , but Martin said them after him in a tone that was barely audible . Catalina , as she was bidden , scrambled to her feet and with a despairing gesture flung the crutch away from her . For an instant she wavered . She did not fall . She stood . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place and the occasion , she turned and ran down the sanctuary steps . " Mother , mother . " Maria Perez , who was with Domingo , beside herself with joy forced her way through the crowd and ran to meet her . Catalina threw herself in her arms and burst into tears . T HE dense throng for a moment was too stunned to move . They gasped in amazement ; then such a hullabaloo arose as never was heard . " The miracle . The miracle . " They shouted . They clapped their hands . Women waved their handkerchiefs . The men cried ole , ole , as they would have done at a bullfight when one of the toreros had made a dangerous pass . Above the din rose ther , piercing tones of a woman here and there singing to a strange , half Moorish tune a hymn to the Blessed Virgin . With their own eyes they had seen a miracle . Suddenly a hush passed over that wild rout , and all eyes were turned upon the Bishop . Martin , in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had shrunk hack , and the Bishop stood alone at the top of the sanctuary steps with his back to the High Altar . In his habit , patched and worn though it was , emaciated , but tall and erect , he made a figure that was awe-inspiring . But the marvelous thing was that he was bathed in light ; it was not a halo that surrounded his head , but an aureole that seemed to clothe him from head to foot . " A saint , a saint , " cried the people , quite forgetting Martin 's share in the occasion . Only Domingo noticed that a pane of one of the stained glass windows was broken and by a fortunate chance a ray of sun passed through the aperture to hit the Bishop and suffuse him with glory . The Bishop slowly walked down the sanctuary . As in a trance , he passed through the kneeling multitude and gave the people his blessing as he went . He did not see Domingo 's ironical glance . XIX T HAT night there was great rejoicing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fill cups and drinking horns fast enough . Chattering crowds wanderedround and round the plaza and talked of the wonderful event of the day . No one doubted but that it was the saintly Bishop who had performed the miracle and all were touched by his modesty in using his brother the baker as an instrument of his power . So he had taught them that in truth the humble would be exalted and the haughty abased . Many vowed that they had seen him rise in the air , two feet from the ground said some and four feet others , and remain there suspended in glory . XX I N THE confusion that ensued when the crowd surged out of the church after the Bishop , Domingo hustled Catalina and her mother through a side door and taking unfrequented alleys brought them safely back to home . Neighbors already were running to share in the excitement , but Catalina broke from her uncle and pounded swiftly up the stairs to her room . She latched the door , and almost in one movement swept her dress over her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked in the center of the sunlit room , gazing with rapt astonishment at her body . Such was her piety that she had rarely before actually regarded her self , but now she stared at the curves of her legs . She lifted her eyes for one brief moment to give a prayer of gratitude to Our Lady , and then she stared at her legs again . With a rush of shame , she still decided that they were quite beautiful . She thought instantly of Diego , and wondered whether he would think them beautiful , or would always be a little frightened because the beauty of one of them , at least , was the result of a public miracle . Flexing her muscles in a little dance around the room , she decided that she was quite capable of meeting such a situation as that when it arose  --  if , indeed , Diego had the courage to return to her at all . She dressed , and went down to accept the congratulations of the neighbors , and after a little while Maria had supper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supped Domingo recited verses appropriate to the occasion . But the plates were barely clean before Catalina sprang suddenly to her feet . " There he is , " she cried . - Who is it ? " asked her uncle crossly . - Diego . Mother , I can go to the reja ca n't I ? " " I should have thought you had more spirit . " The reja was the grill that secured the window from the intrusion not so much of thieves as of too enterprising swains . As a well-behaved girl , who knew that men were lascivious and a woman 's virginity her crowning glory , it would never have occurred to Catalina to admit an admirer into the house , but it was the custom for a girl to it at her window at night and with the grill between talk with the object of her affections of the mysterious things lovers are accustomed to entertain themselves with . He abandoned you when you were crippled , " Maria Perez went on . " And now that you are a celebrity and the whole city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tail between his legs . " " Oh , mother , you do n't know men as well as I do , " said Catalina . " You are a very silly girl . He is a shameless fellow and you should have more self-respect . " " Let her go , " said Domingo . " She loves him and that is the end of it . I daresay he is no more worthless than any other young man of this degenerate day . " With a shrug of her shoulders Maria Perez got up and taking the tallow candle by which Domingo had been reading , said : " Come into the kitchen and read your play to me there . " C ATALINA was left alone . She went to the window and against the darkness of the night saw a figure which made her heart beat . " Diego . " " Catalina . Heart of my soul , " he said , " I adore you . " My love , my precious love , " she answered . " Cursed he this grill that separates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into my arms and cover your face with kisses and press my beating heart to yours ? " She knew very well what that would lead to and the idea did not in the least displease her . She knew that man was a creature of licentious passion and it gave her a thrill of pride and at the same time a sort of heartache that Diego should so vehemently desire her . " Oh , my dear , what can you want of me that I do not want to give you ? But if you love me you can not ask me to do what would he a mortal sin and which in any case these iron bars make impossible . " " Give me your hand then . " The window at which she sat was at some little height from the street , so that in order to do this she had to kneel on the floor . She slipped her hand through the grill and he pressed it to his greedy lips . Her hands were very small , with tapering fingers , hands of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she blushed and laughed when he put her little thumb in his mouth . " Shameless one , " she said . " What will you do next ? " She withdrew her hand . " Behave yourself and let us talk sense . " " How can I talk sense when you rob me of my senses ? Woman , you might as well ask a river to run uphill . " " Then you had better take yourself off . It is growing law and I am tired . The haberdasher 's daughter must be waiting for you and you have no reason to offend her . " This she said with perfidious sweetness and it brought the answer she wanted . " La Clara ? What is she to me ? She has a hump on her back , a squint in her eye , and hair like a mangy dog 's . " " Liar , " she answered cheerfully . " It is true that she is somewhat marked with smallpox and her teeth are a little yellow and one is missing , but except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has a nice nature . " He made uncouth noises of disgust . " I was in the church this morning , " he went on , " and when I saw you stand there in all your beauty it was as if a sword pierced my heart and I knew that nothing in the world could separate me from you . " " I was in a daze . And then it was as if a million pins and needles were pricking my leg so that I could n't have borne the pain another minute and I knew nothing more till I found myself in mother 's arms and she was laughing and crying and 1 burst into tears . " " You ran and as you ran we all shouted with joy and wonder . You ran like a doe that flees from the hunter , you ran like a nymph of the woods because she has heard the voices of men , you ran like . . . . " Her mother 's voice broke in . " Come to bed , child . You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good night 's rest . " " Good night , my beloved . " " Light of my eyes , good night . " XXI T HEY little knew what while they contin- ued every night to talk to each other through the iron grill , a great lady in her oratory , only a stone 's throw away , was contriving a scheme that very much concerned them . Dofia Beatriz was a devout woman who scrupulously performed her duties . The convent she ruled was a model to the community . In conduct and piety she was irreproachable . But she carried in her heart a deadly hatred for a certain nun of Avila , Teresa de Cepeda by name , which neither the precepts of religion nor the repeated censures of her confessor could mitigate . This nun , known in re- ! ligion as Mother Teresa of Jesus , but by the Prioress never referred to but as La Cepeda , had entered the Convent of the Incarnation at Avila where Dofia Beatriz had been first a pupil and then a novice . She had aroused a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , raptures , and the vision of Our Lord , His face blazing with glory ; to say nothing of having driven away the devil who was sitting on her office book by throwing holy water at him ; but the climax came when , dissatisfied with the laxity of the Carmelite rule , she had left the convent and established a new one where a stricter rule was followed . Surmounting ceaseless opposition she founded convent after convent of Discalced Carmelites , as they were called , since instead of the stout shoes worn by the other members of the order they wore sandals with rope soles . No one had fought this reform with greater tenacity than Dona Beatriz . She had never had any patience with the excessive mortifications , the visions and raptures , which the nuns of La Cepeda professed to have . There was a natural antagonism between these two women of strong will . When Teresa de Jesus died , Dofia Beatriz could not suppress a sigh of relief . But in a little while stories began to be told of the miracles she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her death . Already a great many influential people were urging her beatification and it was finally borne in upon Dona Beatriz that sooner or later La Cepeda would be canonized . But if the Prioress could do nothing to prevent the upstart order from receiving an honor for which she could see no justification , it now occurred to her that she could do something to restore the balance by providing her own order with a candidate for canonization . Providence had shown her the way and it would be a sin if she did not take it . Catalina Perez was a pious and a virtuous girl and the miracle by which she had recovered her health had been witnessed not by two or three emotional nuns or self-interested priests , but by a vast concourse . Having received so signal a mark of divine favor it seemed only proper that she should devote the rest of her life to the service of God . Dona Beatriz had heard that she fancied herself in love with a young man of the city , but she brushed this aside ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would think twice of marrying a tailor when she might enjoy the benefits , both spiritual and worldly , which she would have by entering the Convent of the Incarnation of which she was herself the Prioress . If the girl was what the nuns who knew her said she was she could not fail to be a credit to the convent and the grace she had received would add a further distinction to the foundation . She was young enough to react to training and Dofia Beatriz was confident that she could make her a worthy religious . There was no reason to suppose that the Blessed Virgin would cease to take an interest in her and it was far from impossible that she would be the recipient of further graces . Her fame would spread and when in due course she was released from the martyrdom of life she would surely be as suitable a candidate for beatification as the turbulent nun of Avila . About a week after the miracle , therefore , the Prioress had Catalina brought to her . Until then she had never seen her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with a smile , in which there was little of her habitual grimness , graciously remarked on it . C ATALINA was very much in awe of the great lady with whose reputation both for virtue and severity she was well acquainted , but Dona Beatriz set herself to put the girl at her ease . Her face wore an expression of benignity which the nuns but rarely saw and Catalina began to wonder why they were all so much afraid of her . She was a voluble young person and , graciously encouraged to talk , she was soon telling her kindly listener the whole story of her short life with its hardship of poverty , its tribulations and joys , and she never suspected with what skill the Prioress guided her recital to make her disclose her disposition , honest nature , and charm of character . Without a tremor , but with an indulgent benevolence the Prioress heard her describe the merit and beauty of Diego , his sweetness and goodness : and tell how his parents , so unkind to her before , had relented so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prioress desired to hear from her own lips how the Blessed Virgin had appeared to her , the very words she had spoken , and how in the twinkling of an eye she had vanished from her sight . It was then that she gravely but mildly suggested that in common gratitude for the grace she had received Catalina should make a retreat in the convent in order to collect herself and for a little while surrender her spirit to the contemplation of heavenly things . Catalina was taken aback . But she was accustomed to say the first thing that came into her head and by now she had so much lost her awe of the Prioress that she did not hesitate to be frank . " Oh , Reverend Mother , " she cried , " I could n't do that . We 've been separated so long , it would break my Diego 's heart to be parted from me now . He says that he only lives for that hour when we talk to one another at my window . I should pine away if I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press you , child , to do anything . that you do not wish . A retreat could only benefit you if you made it for the love of God and with a sincere desire to amend yourself . I confess I should be disappointed in you if you were so little grateful to the Blessed Virgin for her goodness to you that you grudged her a little time to give her thanks ; and I can not think that this young man , if he loves you as you say and is so good , could take it amiss if for a while , no more than two or three weeks perhaps , in return for the blessing that has reunited you , you devoted yourself to pray for his salvation as well as yours . But we will say no more about it ; the only thing I would ask you is to consult your confessor on the matter . It may be that he will think my suggestion of no value and in that case your conscience will be at ease . " She then dismissed her with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I T WAS no surprise to the Prioress when two or three days later she was informed that Catalina was in the parlor and had come to beg permission to make a retreat . She sent for her , made her welcome , kissed her , and put her in charge of the mistress of novices . Catalina was given a cell that looked over the nuns ' well-tended garden . Though austerely furnished , it was roomy , clean , and cool . There was no need of Dona Beatriz ' request  --  and her requests were orders  --  that Catalina should be treated with indulgence and kindness , for her beauty , modesty , and charm immediately captivated all hearts . Nuns , novices , lay sisters , and lady boarders , all joined in making much of her . They liked her gaiety ; they spoiled her like a favorite child . Though the bed she slept in was such as the rule of the order directed , it was luxurious compared with that to which she was accustotned , and the food she ate , simple and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poverty of her home she had never tasted . Fish , chickens , game were provided from the Prioress ' estates , and the lady boarders invited her to their rooms to partake of sweetmeats and other delicacies. i Dofia Beatriz kept her own counsel ; she was content to let the girl see for herself the delight of conventual life , with its peace , its pleasant activity , and its security from the turmoil and trouble of the world . Its monotony was relieved by the visits during the recreation hour of distinguished ladies of the city and of worthy gentlemen , for the most part relatives of the Prioress or her nuns , whose conversation was not entirely restricted to religious topics . Catalina was not a little flattered by the attentions they paid her . She had entered upon her retreat somewhat rebelliously on the order of her confessor reinforced by the persuasion of her mother , but she found it far from unpleasant . It would have been strange if she did not compare to its advantage the happy , ordered life of the nuns with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always by the specter of want . She enjoyed the services which she attended with all the members of the community in the small but beautiful church attached to the convent . The Prioress had an ear for music and she had seen to it that the singing was good and the rites conducted not only with devoutness but with ceremony . Catalina , with her keen sensibilities , found in them not only a delight to her senses , but a spiritual enrichinent . Very much to her surprise she found the life of the convent not an imprisonment as she had feared but a liberation . She liked to please , and she pleased ; she wished to be loved , and loved she was . Although she missed Diego and thought of him constantly she was obliged to admit to herself that she would look back later on her retreat as one of the most agreeable episodes of her life . Every day , toward evening , Dona Beatriz sent for her and kept her for an hour . She never mentioned her wish that Catalina should enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as a great lady and the Mother Superior of a convent , but as a loving friend . She exerted herself to gain an influence over the girl , but she knew that she must tread warily . She told her stories of the saints to edify her and stories of the Court to show her that even a religious could play a part in affairs of state . She talked to her of the affairs of the convent and the management of her properties not without a notion that it might favorably affect Catalina to see what a responsible and important position it was to be the Prioress of the Carmelite convent at Castel Rodriguez . The possibility of attaining it might well dazzle the daughter of Maria Perez the seamstress. trr very little can be kept secret in a convent and though Drilla Beatriz had never told anyone of her plan , it was not long before it was generally known among the nuns to what end tended the privileges Catalina enjoyed and the notice the awe-inspiring Mother Superior took of her . An effusive nun one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much they wished that she would remain with them for good . A lady boarder who was staying at the convent because her husband was at the wars told her how much she wished she were free to become a religious . " If I were in your place , child , " she said , " I would ask the Reverend Mother tomorrow to accept me as a novice . " " Oh , but I am going to be married . " " You will never cease to regret it . Men by their nature are brutal , neglectful , and faithless . " The lady was pasty-faced , lethargic , and corpulent . Catalina could not but think that if her husband was as had as that there were excuses for him . On another occasion during the recreation hour a lady from the city pinched Catalina 's cheek and archly said : " Well , I hear that we are going to have a pretty little saint in the convent very soon . You must promise to remember me in your prayers , for I am a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me into paradise . " Catalina was frightened . She had no wish to become a nun and much less a saint . She remembered a number of casual remarks to which at the time they were made she had paid no attention . On a sudden it became clear to her that they all expected her to enter the religious life . That evening when as usual she entered the Prioress ' oratory it was with a mind ill at ease . Doria Beatriz noticed that something was wrong . She was direct . " What is the matter , child ? " she asked , suddenly interrupting Catalina in what she was saying . The girl started and flushed . " Nothing , Reverend Mother . " " Are you afraid to tell me ? Do you not know that I love you as if you were my own daughter ? I am hoping you had at least a little affection for me . " Catalina burst into tears . The Prioress held out her arms in an affectionate gesture . MAGAZINE " Come and sit here , child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catalina went and sat at the feet of the Prioress . " I want to go home , " she sobbed . Dona Beatriz stiffened , but in an instant recovered herself . " Are you not happy here , my clear ? We have done all we could to make you so . You have gained the love of all . " " Their love imprisons me . I 'm like a trapped hare . The nuns . the ladies , they seem to take it as a matter of course that I should enter the convent . I do n't want to . " The Prioress was seized with a sudden anger because those foolish women in their zeal had betrayed her , but she did not let a trace of it appear on her grave face . She answered gently . " No one can wish to force you to do what should only be an act of free will under the inspiration of God . You must not blame the ladies because in the attachment they have formed for you they do not want to lose you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have permitted myself to wish that in gratitude for the great mercy that has been shown you Our Blessed Lady might arouse in your heart the wish to become one of us . You would be an honor and a glory to our convent . I know that you are not only humble and pious , but you have a clever head on your shoulders . Too many of our nuns , alas , fail to combine goodness with intelligence . I am an old woman , the burden of my office begins to be more than I can bear ; perhaps it was a sin to indulge in idle dreams , it would have been a great happiness to me if I could have had you by my side , with your tact , your natural kindliness , and your good sense , to share my labors with me and to know that when in the fullness of time my heavenly father called me to himself you would occupy my place . " She paused and waited for a reply . She gently stroked the girl 's cheek . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can not thank you enough for your kindness . It would break my heart if you thought me ungrateful . I am unworthy of the great honor you have in mind for me . " Though in the words there was no blunt refusal of the dazzling offer , the Prioress was too clear-sighted not to see that this was what they implied . She knew that to try further persuasion would only increase her obstinacy . She was not beaten , but discretion suggested that for the moment retreat was wise . " It is a matter for you to decide for yourself according to the dictates of your conscience and I am Ear from wishing to influence you. , , T HE Prioress dismissed Catalina with a fond kiss . Once more alone in her ora- tory she gave herself up to intensive thought . She was not the woman to accept defeat . She felt herself justified in using any means , so long as there was no sin in them , to secure the girl 's welfare in this world and salvation in the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would bring credit to the order . The first thing evidently was to try whether by persuasion more efficacious than her own Catalina could not be brought to a proper state of mind . Though she thought it would be to the advantage and glory of her order that Catalina should enter religion in the convent her father had founded , she was sincerely convinced that it would be also to the girl 's welfare and to the edification of the faithful . The Prioress very well knew that the only real obstacle was the unfortunate attachment the foolish creature had contracted for the young tailor called Diego . It made her impatient to think that for such a trifing reason Catalina should be willing to forego the great advantages , both here and hereafter , which the religious life offered her . But a wise person takes things as they are and knowing the conditions proceeds to deal with them in such a manner as to achieve the desired result . First , then , the Prioress sent for her mistress of novices . This nun , Doria Ana de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she had the interests of the convent at heart . She suggested to Dona Ana that it would be a good thing to spread it among the nuns , the lady boarders , ( lamas de piso they were called , and among the visitors that she was prepared to accept Catalina as a novice . After the wonderful occurrence that had brought her a fame that would in due course become known throughout Spain it was natural that she should wish to embrace the religious life , and it would be a glory to the city that she should dwell in their midst and by her prayers acquire for it the special favour of the Deity . It would surely require more strength of will than a simple girl could be expected to have , to withstand the pressure of public opinion and to refuse the approbation , the admiration even , with which her decision to abandon the world , with its transitory pleasures , would be received . But Dona Beatriz was a practical woman and she was aware that practical advantages also have their weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perez , tell her the good impression she . the Prioress , had formed of her daughter 's virtue and aptitude and what in consequence she was prepared to do for her . She knew that she could trust Dona Ana to make Maria Perez understand how great an honor was thus conferred on her daughter , and how much better a life , materially as well as spiritually , it would offer Catalina than if she married a poor man 's son who might well turn out an idler , a drunkard , and a gambler . Finally Dona Bcatriz told the nun to say that she herself would pay the girl 's dowry which was necessary on entering the religious life and since Maria Perez was growing old and without her daughter 's help might find herself in straitened circumstances she would be pleased to give her a pension large enough to keep her in comfort , without the necessity of working , for the rest of her life . The offers were so handsome that Dona Ana was filled with admiration for her superior 's charity and munificence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her with the injunction to choose a suitable moment to deliver the message and to impress upon Maria Perez the need of absolute secrecy , for she had an inkling that if she talked about it to her brother , the dissolute Domingo , he might be wicked enough to persuade her to refuse her consent . The mistress of novices executed the commission with dispatch and dexterity and within twenty-four hours was able to tell Dona Beatriz that Maria Perez had received her generous offers with humility and gratitude . " Did she say anything about this young man who has been paying Catalina some attention ? " asked the Prioress . " Maria Perez does n't like him . She says he behaved very badly when the poor child had her accident . She thinks him selfish and she thinks he has much too good an opinion of himself . " " It would be difficult to find a man who does not suffer from both of those defects , " said the Prioress drily . XXIII T HE Prioress allowed a few days to elapse so that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit of Cod to take the veil she would be received into the convent of the Carmelites . It was received with gratification . There was a general agreement that such a step would redound to the glory of the city and it was eminently fitting that the girl should take it . It was scarcely decent that the recipient of such a prodigious grace should become the wife of a tailor . The mistress of novices accomplished her particular mission with success . She saw Maria Perez again and warned her to deal tactfully with her daughter , not to press her , but when occasion arose to compare the peace and security of a religious life with the dangers , hardships , and toils of the married state . Dofia Beat.riz had the gift of gaining the devotion and loyalty of her dependents and of these none was more loyal and devoted than the steward of the convent 's properties and her own estates . He was a gentleman . Don Miguel de Becedas by name , and a distant connection of the Prioress ' . She sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both in the city and in Madrid , into the antecedents and present circumstances of Don Manuel de Valero , the soldier , and at the sante time to find out all that was to be known about the young man Diego Martinez and his father . By the time Don Miguel brought back the required information the Prioress had sent Catalina home with a handsome present and with the assurance of her unfailing affection . Catalina bade her farewell with tears in her eyes . " Do not forget , child , that if ever you are in trouble or in any sort of difficulty you have only to come and see me and I will do everything in my power to help you . " Dorm Bcatriz listened attentively to everything the steward had to tell her and was well pleased with the results of his investigations . She then asked him to make an opportunity to see Don Manuel and in the course of a casual conversation tell him that she would be glad to receive a man of whom she had heard so much good . AFT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut himself up in his apartments for three days and refused to see anyone . He was vain and thus sensitive to ridicule . He knew too well the mocking spirit of his compatriots and was fully aware that they were making merry at his expense . He did not think anyone would venture to make an allusion to his misadventure to his face , for he was a good swordsman and it would be a brave man who would risk being run through the body for the sake of a quip , but he could not prevent them from talking behind his back . When at last he ventured to show himself in company there was a truculence in his manner that served as ample warning to those present . He was angry , moreover , not only because he had made a fool of himself , but because he had jeopardized his prospects . His intention in coming to Castel Rodriguez was to find in one of the noble but impoverished families of the place a girl to marry and he had good reason to think that his handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public humilation to which he had been exposed greatly reduced his chances . The nobility of the city were proud , pride in those hard times was all they had left them , and they would refuse the hand of one of their daughters to a man who was a common laughing stock . He was not a little surprised when Don Miguel brought him the Prioress ' courteous message , and flattered , for it had never occurred to him that she would deign to receive him . He was duly ushered into the oratory and left alone with the great lady . She was at her table writing and did not rise to receive him . He looked about for a chair to sit on , but as she did not invite him to take one remained somewhat awkwardly standing . Though a bold , impudent man , he was awed by her dignity . She addressed him with graciousness . " I have heard much , sir , of the courage , devotion , and capacity with which for so many years you have served His Majesty the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has by his own efforts raised himself to such distinction . I was hoping that you would find time to visit me so that I might congratulate you personally on your great exploits . " " I never dreamed that I might without offence intrude upon your privacy , madam , " he stammered . But he began to feel more at his ease . If the daughter of the great Duke of Castel Rodriguez paid him compliments his state could not be so desperate after all . But her next remark , though made with a smile , somewhat disconcerted him . " You have gone a long way , Don Manuel , since you were a little barefoot boy running about the streets of your village and tending your father 's swine . " He flushed , but not knowing what to answer , held his tongue . Dona Beatriz looked him up and down for all the world as though he were a lackey she was about to engage . If she noticed his embarrassment she was not concerned with it . She saw a well set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erect carriage and an air of virility . " Why do you stand , Senor ? " she asked . Will you not do me the favor of taking a seat ? " " You are very good , madam . " " I live a very retired life and my religious duties combined with the business of my office keep me fully occupied , but nevertheless from time to time a scrap of news reaches me from the world outside these walls . I have heard , for instance , that apart from performing a filial duty your object in visiting your native place was to choose a wife from among the noble families of this city . " " After serving my King and country for so many years it is true that I have the desire to make a home for myself and enjoy the delights of domesticity of which I have been hitherto deprived . " " I have a widowed niece , the Marquesa de Caranera , whose husband has unfortunately left her very ill-provided for . She is at present living in this house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life of a religious so that when at last I lay down my arduous functions she might succeed me. as indeed , being the granddaughter of our founder , she would be entitled to . But she lacks the vocation , so I have come to the conclusion that a suitable marriage should be arranged For her . " D ON Manuel was suddenly alert . But he was a shrewd man ; the possibility of being allied with so great a family as that of the Duke of Castel Rodriguez was so far beyond his hopes that he could not but suspect some chicanery . He answered with prudence . " I had not envisaged marrying a widow , but rather a young girl whom I could form to my liking . " " The Marquesa is twenty-four , which is a very suitable age for a man of your years , " the Prioress replied somewhat sharply . " The fact that I intended her to be prioress of this convent after my death proves that I have a high opinion of her ability . I need not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could never have aspired to marry the niece of the Duke of Castel Rodriguez . I should in fact have to use all my powers of persuasion to induce my brother to consent to it . " Don Manuel had been thinking quickly . With the influence of that powerful family behind him there was no knowing to what heights he might rise . " The Marquis of Caranera died without heirs to his title . 1 do not think it impossible that the King might be persuaded to grant it to you . It would be more suitable than this wretched Italian title which you now have . " That clinched it . Though the Marquesa was old , ten years older than the bride he had desired , and might be homely , the advantages of marrying her were too great for him to hesitate . " I do n't know how to show Your Reverence my gratitude for the honor you propose to confer on me . " " I will tell you , " she said cooly , " and indeed it is only by showing your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further . " Don Manuel smothered a sigh of relief . He was far too astute not to know that this unexpected suggestion was made to him for a better reason than his wealth and his military reputation . Being a coarse man the idea flashed across his mind that the Marquesa was pregnant and he had been chosen to father an illegitimate child . He would hardly know then whether to accept or decline the invitation and he waited with some anxiety for Dofia Beatriz to continue . " I desire to enlist your influence on behalf of a young man of this city with the Archduke Albert . I would have no need to do this but for the unfortunate fact that my brother has had a violent quarrel with the Archduke and so can not help me . I have been given to understand that you stand very high in the Archduke 's favor . " He has been good enough to think well of my capacity . " The Archduke Albert was at that time commander in chief of the Spanish forces in the Low Countries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enter the Archduke 's services . He is strong and brave and would certainly make a good soldier . " Don Manuel was much relieved . The Archduke was in various ways indebted to him . He would surely be glad to oblige him by taking into his service anyone in whom he was interested . " I think there would be no difficulty in effecting Your Reverence 's desire . The young man is presumably of good family . " " He is an Old Christian of pure blood . " This of course only meant that there was no taint in him of Jew or Moor . Don Manuel noticed that the answer did not meet his question . " And what , Madam , is the young man 's name ? " " Diego Martinez . " " The tailor 's son ? Then , Madam , what you ask is impossible . The soldiers serving in the Archduke 's army are gentlemen and I could not put such an affront on His Highness as to make the request you wish . " In that case there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useless on the matter or on that I previously mentioned . " D ON Manuel was a worried man . The marriage that the Prioress had proposed would give him the position that he hankered after to further his ambition and he had an inkling that if he refused to accede to her request he would make a dangerous enemy . On the other hand , the consequences might be unfortunate to him if it were discovered that he had lent himself to a plan which the Archduke might very well regard as a personal insult . Dona Beatriz discerned his trouble . " You are a fool , Don Manuel . " Don Manuel cringed under the lash of the Prioress ' tongue . She could ruin him and would not hesitate to do it . " May I ask why Your Reverence takes an interest in this young man ? " he asked hesitantly . " My family have always looked upon it as a privilege as well as a duty to advance the fortunes of deserving persons in this city . " The guarded answer so far restored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrewd . " He is the lover of the girl Catalina Perez ? " Dona Beatriz was affronted by the question , his smile , and the shrewdness of his glance . She had some difficulty in outwardly controlling her indignation . " He has been pestering the unhappy girl with his attentions . " " And is that why you wish him sent to the Low Countries ? " The Prioress considered for a moment . It was probable that he knew the circumstances and it was evident that he was a tactless fellow . There were many things that could be understood , but which it was better not to put into words . She answered him , however , with an impressive dignity . " The girl is young and does not know her own mind . She has admirable dispositions for the life of a religious and there are many reasons which make it highly desirable that she should adopt it . I have no doubt that were it not for the presence of this young man she would soon see the advisability of taking a step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important personages in the the city , and to her mother . " " But , Madam , would it not be much more expeditious and less costly to dispose of the young man on the spot ? It would be very easy to have his throat cut one dark night . " " It would be a mortal sin , sir , and I am shocked that you should venture to propose it . It would make a scandal in the city , give rise to unpleasant gossip , and there is no certainty that it would achieve the desired re-sult . " " Then what would you have me do , Madam ? " " Order a suit of clothes . " Don Manuel was so surprised that , thinking she must be jesting , he looked for a smile to hover on her decided lips . Her face was grim . She explained . " Send for the tailor to take your measurements and to bring samples of materials . He will he flattered and impressed . You must make an opportunity to talk to him about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the city has heard good reports of him and wishes to advance him . Then , binding him to secrecy , disclose to him the plan suggested for the boy 's welfare . Have him send the young man to you on sonic pretext and put it before him . I am assured he looks upon himself as born for better things than to sit on a tailor 's bench and he will without doubt accept with alacrity . " " He will be a great fool if he does n't . " " Let me see you again when you have something to tell me. 1 trust you to be discreet and tactful . " " Never fear , Madam . In two days at the utmost I shall be able to inform you that the business is satisfactorily concluded . " " You may rest assured that in that case I shall perform my part to your satisfaction . " XXIV o ON Manuel sent for the tailor . He ontlined the proposals that were offered to Diego in glowing terms and with the groundwork thus laid he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief that he was a youth of pleasing exterior . Suitably dressed he would certainly pass as a gentleman . He was neither pert nor shy . There was a confidence in his hearing which promised that he would be able to hold his own in any company . Already predisposed in his favor , after a few preliminary remarks Don Manuel broached the subject . They talked for an hour , after which they parted and Don Manuel went to see the Prioress . " I have wasted no time in commands , Madam , " he said . both the boy and his father . " " You have indeed been prompt , Sefior . " " I am a soldier , Madam . The father is in full accord with our plan . He is indeed overwhelmed by the opportunity that the kindness of a benefactor has proposed to give his son . " " He would be a fool to be anything else . " Don Manuel moved uneasily from one foot to the other . " I had better tell Your Reverence word for word what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave him a quick look of inquiry and slightly frowned . " Go on . " " He is a very presentable lad and my first impression was good . " " Your impressions do not interest me . " " I very soon discovered that he dislikes and despises the trade to which his father has put him . He has only adopted it because there was no help for it . " " That I already knew . " " I told him that I could not understand how a young man of spirit and intelligence , endowed with all the qualities necessary for success in the world , could think of wasting his life in a menial occupation . He answered that he had often thought of running away to seek adventure , but was held back by the fact that he had n't a penny in his pocket . 1 then told him that the King wanted soldiers and that it was a career that might easily lead a man of courage and resource to position and wealth . After that I disclosed to him little by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his natural and laudable ambition . " " Very good . " " He took the prospect more calmly than I expected , but it was evident that it tempted him . " " Naturally . He accepted then ? " Don Manuel hesitated briefly . " Conditionally , " he answered . " What d' you mean by that ? " " He said he wanted to marry his sweetheart , but in a year , when she 'd had a baby , he would be willing to go to the Low Coun-tries . " T HE Prioress was enraged . What use could she make of a married woman with a squalling brat ? Catalina 's virginity , her perpetual virginity , was essential to her purpose . " You 've bungled the whole thing , you fool , " she cried . Don Manuel flushed angrily . " Is it my fault if the young idiot is head over ears in love with this girl ? " " Had n't you the sense to tell him that it was madness to refuse such an opportunity ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in this life when you get a chance to better Yourself you must take it and take it quickly because if you let it slip it may never come again . I told him that it was absurd at his age to hamper himself with a wife and that as an officer and a gentleman he could in due course do much better for himself than the penniless daughter of a sewing woman . And if he wanted a girl to amuse himself with he would find plenty in the Low Countries who would be delighted to oblige a good-looking young man and not a few who would be prepared to show their gratitude in a substantial manner . " " And what did he say to that ? " He said he loved his sweetheart . " No wonder the world is in a mess and the country is going to the dogs when it 's governed by men , and men have n't the elements of common sense . " Don Manuel did not know what to say to this and so said nothing . The Prioress gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed , Don Manuel , and I can see no profit in our further communication . " He was acute enough to see that with these words she intimated to him that he need no longer entertain the hope of marrying the widowed marchioness . He was not prepared to give up the chance of so advantageous an alliance without a struggle . " Your Reverence is easily discouraged . ' 1-here are more ways than one of being rid of a troublesome fellow . I have men I can trust . The boy can be seized one dark night , taken to a seaport , and put on a ship . Youth is fickle . Once in the Low Countries , with new sights to see , adventures to be encountered , with brilliant prospects , he will forget his love and in a short while thank his stars that he has been saved from an unfortunate entanglement . " The Prioress did not answer for a while . She was a woman of robust conscience and the plan Don Manuel suggested did not outrage her . " Your Reverence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the offer that has been made him . " " Why ? " " To make himself more precious in her sight by showing her what advantages he is prepared to forego for her sake . " " You are shrewder than I took you for , Sefior . " " When he is missing one morning she will naturally suppose that lie found himself unable to resist the temptation . " The Prioress sighed . " I do not like the plan , but it is evident that the young are foolish and it is often better that their fate should be decided by older and wiser heads . I should require to be assured that no unnecessary violence would be used on the boy . " " I can promise Your Reverence that no harm shall come to him . I will have him accompanied by a man I can rely on who will see that he is well treated . " " It will be to your interest , " she said grimly . " Of that I am fully aware , Madam . You can safely leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propose to act ? " " As soon as I can make the necessary ar-rangements . " She gave him her hand to kiss as he took his leave . and the plan would be carried into effect that night . That settled it . She examined her conscience and knew that her intention was blameless . Toward evening she was told that Catalina requested to be allowed to see her . She was shown into the oratory . The Prioress noticed with dismay that she was violently agitated . " What is it , my child ? " she asked . " Your Reverence told me that if ever I was in trouble I could come to you . " Sobbing , the girl told her that a principal gentleman of the city had offered to send Diego to the wars , with the promise of giving him an estate and getting the title of Don for him . He had refused for love of her and in consequence had had a violent quarrel with his father . His father had said at last that if he did not accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not go peacefully he should go by force , and added that he withdrew his consent to his marriage with Catalina . The Prioress frowned when she heard of the threat . The man was a fool to have made it . Now if Diego disappeared the girl would know that it was not of his own free will . " Men are vain and cowardly , " the Prioress said , " and though they act badly they take pains to be thought well of . How do you know that he is not deceiving you , that he is not talking of force being applied in order to lead you to believe he has abandoned you through no fault of his own ? " " How do I know ? I know because he loves me . Ah , Madam , you are a saintly woman , you do n't know what love is . If I do n't have my Diego I shall die . " " No one ever died of love yet , " said the Prioress with a savage bitterness . C ATALINA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passionate supplication . " Oh , Mother , Reverend Mother , have pity on us . Save him . Do n't let them take him away . I can not live without him . Oh , Madam , if you knew the anguish I suffered when I thought I 'd lost him forever and how night after night I cried until I thought I should go blind ! Why did the Blessed Virgin cause me to be freed from my infirmity if not that I should be fit once more to be my lover 's wife ? She had pity on me and will you do nothing to help me ? " The Prioress clenched her hands on the arms of her chair , but said nothing . " All that time I longed , for him . My heart was breaking . I am nothing but a poor and ignorant girl . I have nothing in the world but my love . I love him with all my heart . " " He 's nothing . He 's only a boy like another , " said Dona Beatriz hoarsely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raven . " Ah , Madam , you say that because you have never known the pain and bliss of love . I want to feel his arms round me , I want to feel the warmth of his mouth on mine , I want to feel the caress of his hands on my naked body . I want him to take me as a lover takes the woman he loves . I want his seed to flow into my womb and to create the child within it . I want to suckle his child at my breast . " She put a hand to each breast and sensuality poured from her in a heat so fiery that the Prioress shrank back . It was like the heat of a furnace and she put up her hands as though to shield herself from it . She looked at the girl 's face and shuddered . It was strangely changed . She was like one possessed . There was something not quite human about her , something so powerful that it was terrifying . Suddenly the Prioress ' face was contorted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears poured down her cheeks . Catalina gave a cry of dismay . " Oh , Mother , what have I said ? Forgive me . Forgive me . " She clasped the knees of the Prioress . She was startled by this exhibition of emotion in one whom she had never seen but calm , grave , and dignified . She was bewildered . She did n't know what to do . She took the clasped hands and kissed them . " Madam , why do you cry ? What have I done ? " Dona Beatriz withdrew her hands and clenched them in the effort to regain her self-control . " I am a wicked and unhappy woman , " she moaned . She leaned back in her chair and covered her face with her hands . Memories of long ago crowded upon her and the gritted her teeth to prevent herself from crying again . The little fool , the silly little fool said she had never known love . How cruel it was that after all these years the old wound should be so green ! She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it struck her  --  that she had eaten her heart out for a boy who was now a wasted , haggard priest . She brushed away the tears that dimmed her eyes and taking Catalina 's face in her hands gazed at her as though she had never seen her before . She was entranced by the fresh young loveliness . So brave , so beautiful , and so passionately in love . How could she break that poor little heart as hers had been broken ? She , who thought she had conquered every human weakness , felt weak , pitifully weak , and yet there was in the feeling something strange and uplifting , something that warmed her heart and at the same time , oh , so comfortingly , crippled her will ; it was as though a knot had been loosened deep within her breast , the breast that had never felt the soft lips of a child nuzzling to find the nipple , and she rejoiced to be relieved of the aching pain . She bent down and kissed the girl 's red mouth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You shall marry your lover . " ATALINA gave a cry of joy and broke into voluble expressions of gratitude , but the Prioress harshly told her to be quiet . The situation was delicate and she had to think . This was the night on which they were to spirit Diego away ; it was true that she could send for Don Manuel and tell him that she had changed her mind ; she could cut his expostulations short ; but that would not solve the difficulties she had got herself into . The seed she had sown had been sown well . There was a feeling widespread in the city that it be-hoved Catalina to become a religious . Dona Ileatriz knew well the passionate devotion the people had for the Faith , they would not only be disappointed if she failed to do what was expected of her ; they would look upon it as an indecency , almost as an insult to religion if after receiving such a grace she married a tailor . The worldly would laugh and make bawdy jokes ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admiration , even with awe , but that could easily change into indignation and contempt . The Prioress knew the violent nature of her countrymen ; they were capable of burning down the house in which she lived , they were capable of ston-ing her as an abandoned wanton and driving a dagger into Diego 's back . There was but one thing to do and that must be done quickly . " You must leave the city , you and this boy , and you must go tonight . Fetch Domingo , your uncle , and come back here with him . " W HEN Catalina in a few minutes came back with her uncle , the Prioress sent her down to wait in her own cell so that she could speak to him alone . She told him such of the facts of the situation as she thought it needful for him to know , gave him certain instructions and with them a short note which she had already written for her steward . She then told him to get hold of Diego and let him know what had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You will spend the evening with me , my child . At midnight I will let you out by a door in the city wall and you will find Domingo with a horse which I have ordered my steward to let him have . He will ride with you to a spot which has been arranged , and there Diego will be waiting . He will change places with Domingo and you are to ride South till you come to Seville . I will give you a letter to friends I have there and they will find suitable work for you and him . " " Oh , Madam " cried Catalina , wild with excitement , " how can I show my gratitude for what you are doing ? " " I will tell you , " answered the Prioress with sonic severity . " Ride fast and on no account linger on the way . You have desperate men to deal with and it may be they will pursue you . Chastity is a woman 's crown and you must preserve it till the Church has blessed your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You will seek out a priest at the first village you come to after daybreak and ask him to join you to Diego in holy matrimony . Do you see what I have here ? " Catalina looked and saw a plain gold ring . " It is the ring 1 had destined for your consecration on your profession . It will be your wedding ring . " She put it on the palm of Catalina 's hand . It made her heart beat hard and swift . The Prioress then proceeded to instruct Catalina on the duties and responsibilities of married life . She listened with becoming gravity , but with some distraction , for she was in a flutter and her mind was more occupied with its delights . They prayed together . The hours passed slowly . At last the convent clock struck and it was midnight . " It is time , " said Dolia Beatriz . She took a small bag from a drawer in her writing table . " Here arc some gold pieces . Put the bag in a place where you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diego get hold of it . Men do not know the value of money and when they have any spend it on foolishness . " Catalina modestly turning her back pulled up her skirt and put the bag inside her stocking and tied the strings round her leg . The Prioress lit a lantern and told the girl to follow her . They walked softly through silent passages till they came out into the garden . They came to a small door . Domingo on horseback was standing in the shadow of the wall , for the moon was shining and the night was bright . " Now go , " said the Prioress . " God bless you , my child , and remember me in your prayers , for I am a sinful woman and I need them . " Catalina slipped out of the door and the Prioress closed and locked it behind her . She listened till she heard the horse 's hoofs . They sounded very loud in the silence of the night . Dofia Beatriz with lagging steps walked back to the convent building . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinded by her tears . She returned to her oratory and spent the rest of the night in prayer . ( To be Continued ) How to Behave in America T IIE first requisites for the enjoyment of a tour in the United States are an absence of prejudice and a willingness to accommodate oneself to the customs of the country . If the traveler exercises a little patience , he will often find that ways which strike him as unreasonable or even disagreeable are more suitable to the environment than those of his own home would be . He should from the outset reconcile himself to the absence of deference or servility on the part of those he considers his social inferiors ; but if ready himself to he courteous on a footing of equality he will seldom meet any real impoliteness . In a great many ways traveling in the United States is , to one who understands it , more comfortable than in Europe . The average Englishman will probably find the chief physical discomforts in the dirt of the city streets , the roughness of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 70-75 ? Fahr. being by no means unusual ) , the dust , flies , and mosquitoes of summer , and ( in many places ) the habit of spitting on the floor ; but the Americans themselves are now keenly alive to these weak points and are doing their best to remove them . Throughout almost the whole country traveling is now as safe as in the most civilized parts of Europe , and the carrying of arms , which indeed is forbidden in many States , is as unnecessary here as there . Those who contemplate excursions into districts remote from the highways of travel should take local advice as to their equipment . The social forms of America are , in their essentials , similar to those of England ; and the visitor will do well to disabuse himself of the idea that laxity in their observance will be less objectionable in the one country than in the other . He will , of course , find various minor differences in different parts of the country , but good manners will nowhere be at a discount . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
