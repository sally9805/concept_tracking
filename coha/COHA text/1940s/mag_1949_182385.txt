THE DREAM MERCHANTS ( 496 pp. ) - Harold Robbins-Knopf ( $3.50 ) . <P> The story of the movie industry has long tempted U.S. novelists , and a few writers have brought Hollywood to fictional life e.g. , F. Scott Fitzgerald in his unfinished elegy to the independent film artist , The Last Tycoon ; Budd Schulberg in his acid-etched portrait of a ratty producer , What Makes Sammy Run ? But most novelists who write about Hollywood become infected with the faults they set out to pillory : garish sentimentality and tabloid vulgarity . <P> Notably of the mine run is Harold Robbins ' The Dream Merchants , which begins promisingly as a closely documented account of the rise of a Jewish storekeeper to movie power but quickly subsides to a spun-sugar saga of love , virtue and clever financing , all triumphant . Where Author Robbins writes as chronicler he has interesting things to say ; where he begins to function as novelist he is simply depressing . <P> Back in 1908 Merchant Peter Kessler took Johnny Edge into his business of running and later producing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movie combine , but through Johnny 's shrewdness and Peter 's stubbornness they break the monopoly and set up Magnum Pictures in Hollywood . Johnny serves in World War1 I and loses a leg , an injury which results in his psychic hardening , followed by his abandonment of sweet young Doris Kessler for a nymphomaniac actress , Dulcie Warren . <P> Soon things begin to go oadly for Johnny . Chiseling financiers drive Kessler out of the fabulously successful company , then begin to edge Johnny out . The man-eating Dulcie beds herself with every available partner in Hollywood , though somehow Johnny does not learn what is going on until he sees the evidence with his own eyes . But in the end , as the reader may confidently anticipate , Johnny is redeemed by Kessler 's kindness , the incredible wealth of a generous Italian banker for whom Johnny worked in his youth , and Doris Kessler 's chin-up plea that he remember his responsibility to the movie addicts who depend on him for " pleasure and escape from the cares of everyday living . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than Author Robbins has managed to provide for readers of his book .
