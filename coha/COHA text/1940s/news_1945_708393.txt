txt ALBANY , Feb. 2 ? With more than 4,000 miles of highway blocked and railroad traffic hampered by fresh snowfalls and high winds causing drifts , Lieut . Gen. Hugh A. Drum mobilized today 11,600 men of the State Guard 's Fourth Brigade to work for eight days , helping to clear the way for much of the food and fuel for the State . Chief bottleneck along these supply lines was in central New York , west of Syracuse , where New York Central tracks , on main and feeder lines , were kept open with great difficulty . The food situation was increasingly tight in up-State cities . Distribution of milk was the major problem . In Syracuse , the milk supply was 40 per cent off . In general , there was not enough milk for normally heavier week-end consumption . In many up-State areas , including Albany , milk companies found it impossible to get their requirements from usual sources . In getting milk elsewhere , these companies tapped territory usually serving other areas . Such situations caused State authorities to fear early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reduced as much as 10 per cent for the week-end but shipments to the city improved to such an extent during the day that customary deliveries could probably be maintained tomorrow and Sunday , it was stated . However , severe storms in the Syracuse-Cortland area have add // ed to the difficulty of getting milk cans back to the milk country by railroad . If more storms increase this problem , a new crisis may arise next week . Charles H. Sells , emergency director of transportation and supplies , declared tonight that it would be " several days before transportation facilities will be adequate for even moderate distribution " not only of fuel and food , but of feed for cattle . " The feed situation throughout the State is becoming increasingly acute , " he said . " Additional snow storms and high winds causing drifting during the past twentyfour hours have created many more tie-ups in railroad facilities and snow blocks on many additional miles of highways . Main routes are blocked in many places ; secondary roads are relatively worse and the local farm roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and poultry feed deliveries will continue only in small quantities and spasmodic intervals . " Milk deliveries to many city consuming centers have been reduced as much as 40 per cent in some places in the State . Egg shortages exist and will increase . Resumption of normal deliveries can not be expected until railroad and road tie-ups are alleviated . " A factor complicating the feed supply is that there can be no more delivery by railroad in the four-day Federal rail embargo which starts at midnight tonight . Hens deprived of corn lay fewer eggs and start to molt . Cows give less milk if fed on hay . State officials say that these circumstances make the fed sit uation of vital importance . In warning that the State can not hope to dig itself out for several days , although it has mobilized its every resource , Mr. Sells urged consumers " to carefully husband their existing supplies " and asked distributors to ration stocks on hand . Hardest hit of up-State cities was Syracuse . Fruit and vegetable supplies were about normal but meat , like milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplies off about 95 per cent . Local livestock was on the market but it was of inferior grade as a rule . The egg supply was 50 per cent off normal . Buffalo Gets Sonic Milk At Buffalo , where there were no milk deliveries yesterday , the situation had improved , but many milk companies were delivering only to stores . Meat , egg and poultry supplies were short largely because of a buying rush by consumers . Heavy winds caused huge drifts southwest of Albany , cutting off a large measure of the city 's milk supply . The situation became no more than tight , however , since other areas were tapped . City barber shops closed today at 1 P. M. and will remain closed until the local fuel emergency lifts . Mayor Frank S. Harris , who persuaded local theatres , bowling alleys , taverns , retail stores and other nonessential businesses to close for the duration of the emergency , appealed directly to Washington today , with this message of the Solid Fuels Administrator , Secretary Ickes , and Senator James M. Mead : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The situation in Rochester was better than in some cities , but the milk situation approached a crisis . A shortage of evaporated milk for baby formulas existed there for some days . The Pet Milk Corporation of St. Louis telegraphed Governor Dewey today , however , that it was sending to the city 1,300 cases of evaporated milk recently released by the Army . With a total of 2,500 members of the State Guard now working at snow removal and fuel delivery in the State , the greatest progress has been made between Albany and Syracuse , where blocked freight yards at Selkirk , Albany and Utica lave been cleared and railroad lines opened . In efforts to clear the highways , State forces have had to resort to dynamite in some places . This happened in areas where snow plows coming through after repeated storms had built such high banks along the roadside that they could no longer throw the snow high enough . Drifts caused by the high winds completely filled in the open space between the banks in some cases . There was little change in coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation had ameliorated somewhat , but the improvement could not in any sense be called general .
