War Department files finally opened up . Washington told how U.S. Colonel Philip Cochran and his second in command , onetime A.V.G. Fighter Pilot John R. Alison , landed " up to a division " of Wingate 's Raiders deep behind Japanese lines in Burma , in one of the great Allied airborne assaults of the war . <P> That weird first night , 27 big C-47 transports hauled their double tows of gliders up to a rough , gullied clearing in the jungle . The glider pilots , Colonel Alison among the first , cut loose , hoped for the best as they headed down for the clearing . <P> Said Alison : " We were in complete darkness on the field because we did n't dare turn on any lights . Gliders were landing at all angles and their pilots could n't see us any more than we could see them . . . . <P> " Men were running all over the field shouting instructions . Often those trying to help wounded men off the field would have to duck out of the path of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lessons . " <P> Fiction Writer James Warner Bellah , now an infantry lieutenant colonel , made the flight , told how 50 men sweated to haul glider wrecks from the landing path . <P> " Two more are howling down over the trees , roaring toward the congestion . One of the two sees it in time . . . but the other crashes head on , and welds two gliders into a ball of scrap . <P> " Screams tear the night and the wrecker crew claws into the wreckage with bare hands to get at the injured . A British surgeon is already inside doing something under a flashlight , something quite frightful with his kukris Gurkha sword after his morphine has stilled the screaming . <P> " And there is a quiet North Country voice in there . ' Do n't move me-this is where I hit-and this is where I die . ' <P> And somebody 's damned good sergeant goes out on the tide . " <P> That night 500 men were taken in , 30 killed , 33 injured . Of 54 gliders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine among the enemy . Six nights later transport planes had shuttled into newly built airfields thousands of men , more than 500,000 Ib. of stores , 1,183 rnules , 175 ponies .
