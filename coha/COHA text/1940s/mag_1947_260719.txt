Nebraska put in a claim last week to having the oldest inhabitants of the U.S. Dr. C. Bertrand Schultz , of the University of Nebraska , told of finding ancient camp sites which may have been human hangouts before the last glacial advance . <P> First finds were stone chips , by-products of ancient munitions-making . They turned up last spring beside Lime Creek , near Cambridge , Neb . When a task force from the University started to excavate , a flood helped by uncovering another chip deposit at the base of a bluff about 50 ft. high . <P> Stimulated by this thick overburden ( hinting at great age ) , the archeologists attacked the bluff with dynamite and a bulldozer . By fall they had uncovered stone , bone and antler artifacts ( prehistoric scrap pile ) , and bones of extinct animals ( prehistoric garbage dump ) . They found no human remains , but obviously ancient man had fancied the spot for a long time , chipping his crude weapons and tossing gnawed bones over his muscular shoulder . <P> The stone weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly well made , their sharp edges finished with delicate flaking . Bone awls and a bone needle indicate that the ancient hunters wore skin clothes of some sort and sewed the edges together . <P> Most exciting to archeologists is the great age of the camp sites . The artifacts were imbedded in a layer of " old soil . " Above them lay many , feet of wind-deposited material ( loess ) , the result of great dust storms associated with the last ( Mankato ) glacial advance , 20,000 to 30,000 years ago . Apparently man reached Nebraska early enough to feel the effect of ice when it last crept toward his hunting grounds .
