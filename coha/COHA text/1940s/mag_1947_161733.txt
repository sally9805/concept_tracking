Last week the Labor Government wiggled out from under its worst labor scare yet . A wildcat strike of about 500 London truck drivers had mushroomed into a walkout of about 40,000 sympathizers and threatened to spread disastrously through the country . The Government got the strike ended in its eleventh day , but it was severely clawed by the wildcatters . So was the strong but unwieldy Transport and General Workers Union , to which most of the strikers belonged . So was London 's long-suffering public . The truck drivers had struck in protest against union and government bumbling that had delayed for more than nine months a settlement of their demands for a 44-hour week and overtime pay increases ( highest wage of a London trucker : about $22 a week ) . Even the Government 's delayed and reluctant decision to use troops to move food ( most Londoners were down to half-rations of meat and vegetables and some were down to no rations at all ) failed to move the striking truckmen . But " Operation Eatables " ( the soldiers ' name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men &; women who handle London 's food . When the troops appeared , they walked off their jobs . So , eventually , did thousands of T.G.W.U. dock workers in resentment against the use of " blacklegs strikebreakers in uniform . " <P> " It makes a Change . " At first London was jittery ; it expected clashes and cracked skulls . But at Smithfield ( meat ) , at Billingsgate ( fish ) , at Covent Garden ( vegetables ) , the strikers stood aside , watching placidly , but with professional scorn , as the soldiers inexpertly tugged and hauled unaccustomed burdens . Sighed one striking porter as a young Coldstream Guardsman struggled with a sack of potatoes : " He 'll rupture hisself if he do n't watch out . " <P> Wary of the strikers at first , the soldiers soon rubbed sore shoulders with them in neighborhood pubs . Bert 's Bar , a dingy shack in Smithfield market , set the tone with an inviting sign : " Bert 's Buns Are Better than NAAFI . " * Inside soldiers and strikers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The attitude : " We do n't bear the boys any grudge ; they ca n't help but do what they 're told . " At Smithfield 's nearby mahogany-and-gilt pub , " The Hope , " soldiers and strikers sipped beer together . Said a happy Guardsman : " It makes a change . If we were n't working here , we 'd be square-bashing squad drilling . Best part about this is the expression on the faces of the housewives when we deliver the goods . " <P> The strike 's end came after several meetings in which the wildcatters flatly refused to return to work on the promise of double-quick Government dealing with their demands . At last , a deadlock-breaking meeting convinced them of something more : that they would get pretty much what they wanted in wages &; hours .
