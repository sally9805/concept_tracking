Little drops of water , little grains of sand , Make the mighty ocean and the pleasant land . <P> Until recently scientists knew little more than the nursery rhyme about why the earth has oceans and land , or why most of its high land masses are concentrated on one side , opposite the Pacific Ocean . If the earth condensed from gases or from meteorlike particles , as many theories have held , it should be smooth and symmetrical with a deep layer of water covering the whole surface . <P> Within the last few years a wealth of new information-from seismology , astronomy and nuclear physics-has been brought to bear on the problem . Scientists are beginning to explain why the earth is not too smooth for such land animals as man to live on . <P> All Water . Nobel Prizewinner Harold C. Urey of the University of Chicago is one of the scientists who has arrived at a new theory of the earth 's birth and development . According to Urey , the earth and the moon were formed at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First materials to " precipitate " from the cloud were light stony silicates , which formed the cores of the earth and moon . But the earth 's core was bigger than the moon 's , and it attracted much more of the heavy iron which precipitated later from the dust cloud . For this reason , says Urey , the moon is lighter , volume for volume , than the earth . <P> After the iron had precipitated , the earth was a solid , fairly cool but basically unstable object . In its center was a ball of comparatively light rock . Around the rock was a thick layer of mixed iron and stone . Then came a very thin layer of stone . The whole great ball was smooth and symmetrical , with no land . Deep ocean covered the whole surface . <P> In this round-the-world ocean , Urey thinks , life evolved a billion and a half years ago . There is no record of these ancient creatures because they were all " pelagic , " living at or near the surface of the water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skeletons because there was no land or shallow bottom for non-floating forms to live on . <P> Divided Land . But while life was evolving , the earth was heating up because of the radioactivity of its stony ingredients . The stony core got hotter and so did the stone-iron mixture . Eventually the outer mixture got soft enough for the iron to trickle down toward the center . Its " fall " of several thousand miles made the earth 's middle layers even hotter . <P> Then , says Urey , the light stone core began to float up through the iron like a tennis ball through molasses . As it approached the surface , land appeared for the first time ; the oceans were crowded to one side , as on the third day of biblical creation. * For a while the earth had only a single continent ( Pangea ) , but the continuing rise of the core material and its spreading out near the surface broke Pangea into chunks and carried them apart . His theory , says Urey , accounts for the remarkable fact , first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drift , that the eastern coast of the Americas looks as if it had been split away from the western coast of the Old World . <P> <P> * " And God said , Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place , and let the dry land appear : and it was so .
