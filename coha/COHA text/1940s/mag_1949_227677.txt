In movie trade lingo , a sureseater is a small " art " theater specializing in upperbrow films for upperbrow audiences . The word was originally used to suggest that every seat is sure to be filled . A skeptical Hollywood crack favors another interpretation : whenever you go , you are sure to get a seat . Last week the Hollywood joke rang hollow ; having grown in a year from 226 to 270 , U.S. sureseaters were booming . Symptoms : <P> The Selznick Releasing Organization had turned down a chance to book the British-made The Fallen Idol into Manhattan 's 6,000-seat Radio City Music Hall , instead waited patiently to put it into the 550-seat Sutton theater , where the British-made Quartet was in its 28th week . <P> On gaudy Times Square , the Embassy Newsreel theater was working on a deal with the J. Arthur Rank Organization to become a showcase for topnotch British films . <P> Sureseaters had opened in San Diego and Salt Lake City . Others were planned in Denver , Seattle , Portland , Tacoma . Los Angeles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would soon get one more which has hitherto specialized in westerns . <P> The East Coast 's Trans-Lux theater chain had shocked the industry by passing up Walt Disney 's Ichabod and Mr. Toad in favor of The Fallen Idol for its Washington house . <P> The usual sureseater formula is simple : give moviegoers what they rarely get in standard cinemansions-a single feature , no popcorn , well-behaved next-seat neighbors , super-comfortable seats and , most important , high-quality pictures from Britain , France , Italy and sometimes even Hollywood . Some 70 of the U.S. sureseaters show this kind of film exclusively ; the rest , as often as they can get them . <P> For such pleasures , the art theaters ' customers seem increasingly willing to pay premium prices ( up to $2.40 ) while admission prices elsewhere are slipping . Because the theaters are small , the runs are long . <P> For producers like Rank ( Henry V , Hamlet ) , the sureseaters have been a bonanza . Eagle Lion , distributor of Rank 's The Red Shoes , has grossed more from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other pictures in Philadelphia theaters during the same period . Better still , less receipts have to be splurged on costly ballyhoo ; a sureseater hit automatically woos the kind of audience that is eager to seek out a good film . <P> Will Hollywood moviemakers go after some of this rich gravy by aiming more pictures at adults ? Obviously , Hollywood 's bosses can not neglect the mass audience that keeps 19,000 U.S. theaters going . But as the sureseaters keep growing , their operators-and their surefire audiences-are hoping that some producers will be tempted .
