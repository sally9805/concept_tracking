HEN Arthur Brisbane , the journalistic sage and shrewd real-estate speculator , died on Christmas Day , 1936 , editorial writers everywhere were torn between politeness and honesty . In the immediate presence of death , and particularly at Christmastime , they felt they had to make obeisance to the man who had been the most successful of all editorial writers , a gifted colleague who had become a millionaire in the practice of what , in these degenerate times , is commonly regarded as one of the moat thankless of the arts . On the other hand , because so many of them viewed him with a mixture of awe , hatred and envy , they could not bring themselves  --  unless , of course , they happened to be employed on the Hearst papers  --  to give forth the usual ungrudging encomiums . Therefore , they dismissed him with the lazy man 's epithet  --  that is , they said he was " contradictory . " This was perhaps a safe enough escape from a tough situation . But these gentlemen were on the trail of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contradictory . " He wrote more than 500,000 words a year ; it would have been remarkable if , out of that appalling mass , there had not been a great deal of downright nonsense , and many ideas that clashed with one another violently . He could reverse himself , with a charming blandness , on almost any subject . He could be delightfully and whimsically generous ; he could be mean and cruel . When in good humor , he could be the most affable of men ; when crossed , his handsome face would contort itself into a monstrous andfrightening caricature . His word was good , and yet he was sly in business matters . A hardheaded New Yorker who had been associated with him in many deals said of him recently , " He was thoroughly honorable , but you had to watch him . What of it ? You have to watch everybody these days , do n't you ? " Yes , he was " contradictory , " but there was nothing particularly baffling about him . An old acquaintance summed him up this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about him was simply this : He was never a man to cringe from either adulation or money . " Those were what he wanted . He got them both . From first to last , in fair weather and foul , he was steadfastly , unshakably pro-Brisbane . He kept his eye on the main chance . Perhaps his most startling eccentricity was his mania for talking about how much money he made . This trait could be dismaying to persons who had just met him , and who had been accustomed to a certain amount of reticence in such matters . It sounds incredible , but he was addicted to forthright announcements like this : " I 'm delighted to meet you , sir . Did you know that Hearst paid me two hundred and sixty thousand dollars last year ? " Some people were inclined to be flabbergasted ; others , after getting over their first surprise , pro-leased to see something almost lovable in his blunt , delighted confessions about money . And this love of money as a topic of conversation was by no means a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a faded crone who had been a cashier in a moderately rowdy resort operated in27 the 90 's and earlier at Houston and Crosby streets , New York , by Harry Hill , a well-known sporting figure of that period . It was in this place that John L. Sullivan , later a friend of Brisbane 's , fought for his first New York purse . This woman said that one day Brisbane , then a dashing , good-looking reporter , came bouncing in and announced with glee that he had just received a five-dollar raise . She said he bought wine , which he often liked to do when he had something to celebrate , although ordinarily he was anything but a Good-Time Charlie . Although , in his later years , Brisbane was occasionally repetitious to the point of being a bore , he was fascinating to watch in action . He had made his money , though he always wanted more . He had achieved that distinction in his profession for which he had driven himself so relentlessly through the decades . But there were times when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitter with frustration at the thought  --  whether he was not losing touch with current ideas , fresh customs , the new generation . He would write as cocksurely as ever , but to a few friends he often referred to the dispiriting fact that he was an old man . Brisbane in Retrospect I T WOULD occur to him , especially after his seventieth birthday , in 1934 , that he might be approaching the end . But . he would pull himself together gamely and write in his column that if people took care of themselves and ate sensibly , they might easily live to be 140 . He still drove himself hard , but he would coddle himself in many little ways . He feared drafts . On chilly days he would swathe his throat in a heavy muffler ; in very bad weather he would appear grotesquely wearing a black skullcap . He often observed that germs were everywhere , and his tone indicated that he felt they had malicious designs on him . " One more attack of pneumonia and I 'm done for , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared to accentuate his frantic manner . He became more and more impatient . He suspected , and correctly enough , that he might not have long to live , and he thoroughly disapproved of the idea . It was in these last years , and particularly during the last months of his life , that he took an even greater delight than usual in recounting  --  for the benefit of almost anyone who would listen  --  the glories and triumphs of his yesterdays . He would chuckle at the recollection of having beaten the blind Joseph Pulitzer at cards . He would refer to his relations with William Randolph Hearst with pride , and would estimate the millions he had made for Hearst . When he spoke of Hearst , it was without any note of feeling , one way or the other , though his remarks were always friendly enough . But when he talked of Pulitzer , for whom he had worked before he joined Hearst , there was something approaching affection in his voice , and his cold blue eyes would show a trace of warmth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He would boast of his real-estate coups . He would tell of the noted journalists he had snared away from other papers ? " I took Bill Corum away from Ochs , who did n't appreciate him . I brought Keats Speed from Atlanta , " and so on . And to the very last , he would take an almost childish pleasure in winning a bet , no matter how small  --  anything to prove his superiority . Still , in his column he was the stern moralist , opposing gambling of all forms . Those who talked much with Brisbane , or followed his curious pronouncements closely , could not avoid being struck by the respect he had for what lie regarded as his own virtues . The manifestations were many and sometimes fantastic . For example , he had never gone to college , although he had attended lectures abroad ; therefore he often denounced American ( Continued on Page 651 HE SRTURDRY EVENING POST ti j " Any questions , Mr. Gorley ? " The lawyer weakly shook his head in reply . The court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this entire case shows a criminal conspiracy to loot the bondholders and water users . They pretend it was legal . We deny it . By no stretch of reasoning did Burns earn that commission . The sale was prearranged ; he was simply a tool ; his reward was a free house . As for the site for the dam , the intent to defraud is crystal clear . I ask for judgment and an injunction . " The jurist nodded grimly . " I hold this witness for perjury , and I will see to it that he , together with all others involved , is indicted for conspiracy . " He spoke curtly to the defense lawyer , who had recovered somewhat and was rising for a last stand , " Spare us your colleges and universities as being a waste of time . He estimated that it " would take a young man eleven years " to recover from the pernicious effects of a college education . His own eyes were strikingly blue ; he had a good word for blue-eyed individuals , wherever placed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He waited until he was forty-seven to marry ; he was an advocate of late marriages for men . In a speech before the women comprising the Fashion Group in New York , he advised them to stop such foolishness as designing clothes and go home " and have six children . " Brisbane was the father of six children . Brisbane was treated with deference by his journalistic associates , many of whom feared him . He was impatient when other people tried to tell anecdotes . And in conferences , when someone might offer a light note , he would observe that " this is no time for levity " ? and usually he was right . Many of his coworkers referred to him as " Boss . " Years ago , when he was directing the New York Evening Journal , the famous cartoonist , Thomas A. Dorgan ( " Tad " ) , began referring to him , behind his back , as " Double-Dome George , " professing to see a similarity between Brisbane and a current comic-strip character who went by that name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and that is the only nickname Brisbane ever had . It is doubtful that he ever knew about it . I had seen Arthur Brisbane many times , usually in restaurants or at those semipublic affairs to which newspapermen are dragooned , but I did not meet him until Christmas Day , 1934 . He telephoned me at noon at the office of the Herald Tribune , where I was city editor , and said , " This is Arthur Brisbane . I want you to have lunch with me . Meet me at one o'clock at Moore 's Restaurant , Forty-sixth Street . " I was there , at a table where I knew he usually sat , five minutes before he arrived . He came in , gave his hat to the girl by the door , and then walked on rapidly . We were the only customers in the establishment that cold day . Quickly he gave a magnificent exhibition of the Brisbane technique , the basis of which was flattery  --  obvious flattery , but effective , nonetheless . He did three things : 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , " Hello , Boss ; I 'm glad to see you . " I warmed at that " Boss , " arguments , Mr. Gorley . Save them for the appellate court . " Judge Yost said , " You saved this community close to a hundred thousand dollars . Shevlin will have to disgorge that commission . The Water Authority will never buy that land now . They will have to condemn it and pay a fair price for it . Of course , this is only the beginning . They will appeal . They will fight the criminal cos , . to the last ditch . But the sword of justice will yet smite them . " He smiled . " Those reporters want you . " " Martha , " said John that evening , " I still have eight days of my vacation . Have you any plans for me ? " Martha looked up from her knitting . " How do you like that , Professor Rainey ? As if I ever dictated what he should do with his time ! " 2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting a blind date , " You look exactly as I hoped you would . " I was beginning to be on his side . 3 . Then he said , " I called you at your office because , from what I 've heard of you , I knew that you and I are the only newspapermen in New York who would be fools enough to work on Christmas Day when they did n't have to . " That was a stroke of genius , for I had always taken a secret and silly pride in doing work I did n't have to do . The rest was easy . He said he wanted me to join him on the Daily Mirror , of which he had just taken charge at Hearst 's request . I was to be managing editor . He mentioned a sum which , although not exorbitant , was more than I had been making . We talked of the paper , its needs and its chances . I told him that I thought it had an excellent chance to get ahead , but that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to legitimate news and less to the morbid , the cheap and the unreliable stuff which often filled its columns ; that it needed a stronger and more entertaining editorial page , and that it should decide on a consistent policy and follow it . He agreed with enthusiasm . He asked me what the paper had that was of much value , and I said : " The best assets you have are Dan Parker , the sports editor , who is one of the best anywhere , and then you have Walter Winchell . If you lost Winchell you would n't have much left . " At the mention of the great Broadway gossip writer , Brisbane 's face clouded . Then he said , " I suppose you 're right . " He toyed with a lamb chop and went on . " But not even Hearst has enough money to pay me to read him . " Brisbane finished one lamb chop ; he had another one left . " I ca n't eat it , " he said . " It 's too much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If I do n't eat this chop , what will happen ? " The waiter , an elderly Irishman who looked like a statesman , was puzzled , but said , " Why , nothing , Mr. Brisbane . " " What ? " exclaimed Brisbane . " You do n't mean you 'll throw it away  --  waste it ? " " Oh , no , " said the waiter . " It will go to a good cause . " Brisbane was much relieved at this ; the idea of waste was so abhorrent to him that it could almost make him ill . ( Continued on Page 67 ) ( Continued from Page 65 ) Brisbane and I quickly came to terms ; there was no haggling . I had always wanted to see what a tabloid could be Tike . Moreover , I would be getting more money . I was tired of the work I had been doing without a letup for some seven years , and I had the feeling  --  not uncommon among young men  --  that I was not quite properly appreciated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled out a dollar bill and , before giving it to me as a token binding the contract , wrote on it : " For this Stanley Walker agrees to work for Arthur Brisbane . " A few days later I went to work at the Mirror  --  if " work " is what it might be called . The whole adventure turned out to be unhappy , though there was never any actual unpleasantness . I found that I was supposed to find some way of easing out the editor , Emile Gauvreau , the talented but unpredictable tabloid operator whose contract still had almost a year to run . Rather than do that , I went to some pains to remain on good terms with Gauvreau . It also became apparent that Brisbane , far from directing the paper into the lines I had expected , was bent on making it , if possible , somewhat yellower and more incomprehensible than usual . He resurrected many of the ideas he had used - with telling effect on the Journal of forty years before , believing that they still had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs. Marie Gasch , the original Beatrice Fairfax , and had her start an advice-to-thelovelorn section . He insisted on panels of drawings to illustrate crimes , just as he had in the days before photography became important . He wanted bigger and blacker headlines for the first page . " You ca n't see these from across the street , " he complained . Neither Brisbane , Gauvreau nor myself was making any effective contributions to the paper , and Hearst was not far wrong some months later when he notified Brisbane that " you are now getting out the worst newspaper in America . " Brisbane seemed puzzled , and somehow offended , when circulation remained about where it had been . He insisted on circulation , at the same time howling for more and more economy . In other words , he wanted magic . He professed to be unable to understand the enormous circulation of the other morning tabloid , Capt . Joseph Medill Patterson 's Daily News . " Patterson is no genius , " he would tell me and Gauvreau . " In some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letting him get away with this . " In August , after I had been shifted downtown to the American to warm a chair , I requested that , if agreeable to Mr. Hearst , I be released from my contract . All hands were delighted . I walked out . The dollar bill which Brisbane had signed on Christmas Day I gave to a panhandler , cautioning him to buy nothing but whisky with it . Gauvreau followed me out of the organization soon afterward , and Brisbane himself finally relinquished most of his interest in the paper . This was all for the best . We were a hopeless trio . The Mirror is today a pretty fair paper . I saw Brisbane many times after that , for short chats . There was never any hard feeling between us . Indeed , he looked upon me with a new curiosity when he learned that I had given up a contract which still had $48,000 to go . He did n't know whether I was a fool or not ; neither did I. But in spite of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some amusing times on the Mirror . There was the day when Brisbane , his eyes alight with inspiration , announced that the paper was going to start a campaign  --  a campaign with the triple-threat slogan : " Get Married  --  Have a Baby  --  Buy an Automobile . " He asked me and Gauvreau and George Clarke , the coffee-drinking , tap-dancing city editor , what we thought of it . Gauvreau and 1 , who had long since decided there was no more fun in yessing the great man , or any point to it either , said we did n't like it . Then Clarke said , " If I may say so , Mr. Brisbane , I think it will be confusing . Read your slogan again . You will see that it reverses the sequence to which most of our readers , and , I dare say , most modern New Yorkers , have become accustomed . " Brisbane glowered , said something about this being no occasion for levity , and went ahead with his campaign , which was a dismal flop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of healthy , vigorous American womanhood . One day he read a stray item about two girls from the Northwest who had won a woodchopping contest . He wrote an editorial praising them , and then asked us to bring the girls to New York and have them chop down a tree in Central Park . All this entailed much negotiation , some expense , and a vast amount of worry for all . This is not meant unkindly , but when the girls showed up it was clear at once that they would never have caused the late Florenz Ziegfeld , or even Mr. Billy Rose , to turn a hair . We put them through their paces , and then Clarke and I did a cruel thing : We delivered them to Brisbane 's office just before lunchtime and left them there . Never again did Brisbane mention lady woodchoppers . Indeed , he wrote that in evaluating womanly charms , the forehead  --  he himself had a prominent forehead  --  was the most important factor , more so than even the eyes , nose , mouth or torso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winchell flattering and kowtowing to each other . They had only two things in common  --  great energy and a desire to talk about themselves , particularly about how much money they made . In these bouts , Winchell , being younger and faster , usually beat Brisbane to the punch , although the Old Master would manage to get in a sentence now and then . Brisbane , although he spoke approvingly of Winchell in interviews and in speeches , often confessed in private that he had little use for him . He could never quite understand why Winchell should have been able to make so much money by writing and talking of matters which , to Brisbane , seemed utterly inconsequential ; on the other hand , he admired anyone who could make money . And when a man could make so much from Hearst , it was doubly marvelous . Brisbane had a way of picking out favorites on a staff , often with little more to guide him than their looks or pure whim . Also , he could take an instant and unaccountable dislike to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal prejudice or grudges of his rich friends . Once , because the owner of a racing stable had objected to something written by Fred Keats , the turf writer , he ordered that Keats be fired forthwith . It took much diplomacy and argument to save Keats . Again , he came into the office one day , stopped short , scowled and pointed his finger at a woman reporter who happened to he wearing a low-cut red dress . " Fire that woman ! " he commanded . It was explained to him that she was one of the ablest reporters and rewrite experts on the paper , with a fine record . At length he relented , and this woman finally became one of his favorite lady journalists . He did not like fat men around him , a phobia which seems to afflict many publishers , including the late Frank A. Munsey . He did not approve of smoking , but he felt that if an employee must smoke , he should smoke cigarettes , which would keep him nervous and therefore alert . He distrusted pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was suspicious of journalists who wrote books ; he held , and sometimes with justice , that they were neglecting their regular work in order to further their literary ambitions . He hated any // show of idleness as savagely as he hated waste . As a young man , when he was building up the Journal , he used to commute from Hempstead , Long Island , arriving at the office at 4:30 in the morning . He often recalled this , and had harsh words for the modern softies who like to sleep late . And yet , for all his insistence on hard work and getting things done , there is grave doubt that he himself was a model of efficiency . He liked to attend to all his correspondence , as well as write his columns and editorials , by barking into a dictaphone . These records would later he transcribed by his corps of secretaries . He had one dictaphone in his office , another in his automobile and another in his home . But he had so many irons in the fire and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he often overran himself , with the result that his affairs would suffer from delays and errors . It is probable that he could have accomplished just as much with two ordinary , fast , levelheaded stenographer secretaries . His impressive paraphernalia was largely window dressing , marking him before the world as an extremely high-powered and scientific executive . This dictaphone habit of Brisbane 's was the subject of much comment and rude jest among the more irreverent . Once Gene Fowler , who was with the Hearst papers for many years , and who was widely loved because of his high spirits and devilish ingenuity , sneaked into Brisbane 's office while Brisbane was out and dictated a long , brilliant but shockingly Rabelaisian editorial . When the gadget was turned on for transcription , it sounded like a Brisbane gone mad , to the consternation of many people . This was the sort of joke that Brisbane did not appreciate . It is still a moot question among students of such subjects whether Brisbane had what is known as a sense of humor . Some of the companions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could laugh . It is possible that his admirers mistook his high good humor and his animal zest for a sense of humor . However , he could not trust his own judgment on what was amusing . When the Journal was enjoying its great years , Brisbane used to take a drawing , or a new comic strip , or some other fresh idea , and show it to Tad , or Damon Runyon , or " Bugs " Baer , demanding to know , " Is this funny ? " And out of the millions of sentences he wrote , though many of them had an arresting and even powerful quality , not one is remembered today as an example of tbisrather unimportant observation plagued him for years . Once , when a gorilla escaped from the Bronx Zoo and was recaptured with little difficulty by its keeper , reporters kept Brisbane 's telephone busy for hours with such questions as : " Now , what do you make of that ? " " Does n't this revise your theory ? " " Are you going to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside himself . He replied simply by saying that he stuck by his guns , that the Bronx incident had been " framed . " Over and over Brisbane belabored the point that pugilism was a waste of time , that fighters , with the possible exception of his friend Gene Tunney , were a stupid lot , and that people who went to prize fights were almost as ridiculous as those who went to race tracks . And yet , when a big fight came along , Brisbane would be there , in the front row , sometimes writing a story about it  --  and doing it pretty well , at that . He had been interested in fighting since , as a correspondent for The New York Sun , he had covered the messy encounter between John L. Sullivan and Charlie Mitchell , who went thirty-nine rounds at Chantilly , France . Brisbane himself , as a stripling , was handy with his fists , and a competent wrestler . He was also a fast runner . Brisbane 's fascination with the prize ring , which he so persistently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the early part of 1935 that Joe Louis , who had not then won the championship , was sure to be recognized as probably the greatest of all heavyweights . Brisbane insisted that Louis be brought to his office , and the meeting was arranged . Louis said a dozen or so words , while Brisbane dilated on . his theories of fighting and recalled his experiences with the great Sullivan . Louis finally departed with his managers and bodyguards , and Brisbane whirled about to dictate his daily column . He told of meeting Louis , and he had a circumstantial passage in which he said that Louis was not all Negro  --  that he had white blood in his veins . Now , to Brisbane , who was pathetically obtuse in such delicate matters , this was not an insult . Far from it . But poor Louis was terribly shaken and hurt by the slur , and for long afterward his face would grow stormy when the great editor 's name was mentioned . He felt worse about this than Brisbane would have felt if someone had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just as he had a blind spot in dealing with the sensibilities of this simple Negro fighter , he also had an abiding contempt for the great masses of the people  --  the very people to whom he preached , and who at times looked upon him as friend and mentor . In his twilight years he still seemed to regard the bulk of New Yorkers as the same bewildered , ignorant , trusting oafs to whom he had catered back in the Journal days . Forty years of education and breeding , he felt , had left them untouched . He had in him , clearly , many of the instincts of the aristocrat , but he was predominantly a snob . He had little use for people who were of no importance ; they were a waste of time . That is probably why , in his relations with " important " people , he could be so amiable and open handed , every inch the " good sport . " As a young man he had been something of a social lion . When he was coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , the Caf ? Martin , and the Hoffman House . As an old man he also ate well  --  usually at Dinty Moore 's , Jack and Charlie 's 21 , the Plaza , the Lafayette , Christ Cella 's , and Pietro 's in New York , all of which are beyond the reach of the proletariat . Here he was almost lavish in his expenditures . But there are stories of how , when in a hurry , he would slip into a cheap restaurant or a lunch counter for a quick meal . A waitress in one such place , pocketing a five-cent tip and glaring at his retreating figure , said one day , " They tell me he 's a big man , but a girl will never get rich off his tips . " However , for all his occasionally antisocial attitudes , he had a great many friends , and many of these were men and women who had known him for a long time . One of the closest and stanchest was Bernard F. Gimbel , the department-store operator and sportsman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunched together , went to the theater and to prize fights together , and visited each other in their homes . They also collaborated in many business ventures . Likewise , Brisbane was on good terms with HenryFord , the Rockefellers , and many other men of substance . And he was a good friend , companionable , entertaining and thoughtful . Important men liked to listen to his homilies and his prophecies . Some of his predictions were utterly ridiculous , but others hit the nail squarely on the head . For example , more than thirty years ago he wrote a column that set forth , with amazing accuracy , the whole future trend of the automobile industry . Here , also , is one of the explanations of why he was successful in the real-estate field . Real-estate men were ( Continued on Page 70 ) ( Continued from Page 68 ) immensely flattered when he spoke at their meetings . Some of them would go home that night and yawn , " Well , mamma , you 'll never guess who I had lunch with today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between New York real-estate conditions today and some period in ancient Rome . Very interesting . " He put on an act now and then for real-estate men which never failed to charm them . He would refer to himself as " a bad guesser " in real-estate matters , as a man who had " made many mistakes , " who was burdened by taxes , and so on . To his listeners , who had a pretty good idea of how his deals had gone , this talk was not only ingratiating but it was humor of a rare order . He would say that he had learned about real estate by studying the theories of Henry George , the old apostle of the single tax , whom Brisbane once had supported for mayor of New York . It is more likely that he worked out his own schemes for profitable dabbling in realty . He often knew in advance the trend of public improvements ; some of his Jersey City investments may be traced to this foreknowledge . Again , he foresaw the need for the great East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there along the route . He thought for years that a bridge would be built across the Hudson at 57th Street , and he bought much property in the upper Fifties . This was by no means an unsound idea , even though the bridge never materialized . In many of his realty speculations , Hearst was a close partner , but there came a vague coolness between them . Hearst once said that Brisbane was always coming to him with attractive schemes for making money , but that when these schemes were examined , it would turn out that the profits were to be split , " ten per cent for Hearst and ninety per cent for Arthur . " Father and Son Students of journalistic ethics , who are easily horrified , have criticized Brisbane for boosting editorially various improvements by which he stood to profit . There is a wealth of proof that he did this ; muckrakers have been over the ground many times . It is doubtful that this ugly charge ever gave Brisbane a moment 's twinge of conscience . He would also use his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to be interested at the time . For example , he would write a glowing article advising his public to see a certain theatrical production . There would be a quid pro quo  --  a page of advertising , or a contract for a series of advertisements . There were times , however , when he yearned for righteousness . He had respect for the memory of his father , Albert Brisbane , the old disciple of Charles Fourier , who was one of the original Socialists and a believer in communal-living projects . Arthur was fond of recalling how his father had actually paid out good money to get a column he wrote into Horace Greeley 's old New York Tribune . " Whereas , " he would say , " Hearst pays me a fortune for writing stuff that 's not as good . " To a question as to why he drove himself so furiously to make money , Arthur Brisbane once said it was because his own father had died in obscurity , leaving his children nothing ; he did not want that to happen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albert Brisbane , that dreamer of another century , another world almost . Once , when he was engaged in a fruitless dicker with Heywood Broun , they sat under a picture of Albert Brisbane . " That , " said Broun , " looks like a man who was at peace with himself . " " Yes , " said Brisbane . " He never had to work for Hearst . " Many times Arthur Brisbane wrote approvingly of religion . But this was because he regarded it as a sort of merciful illusion which sustained people and comforted them when they might otherwise have had nothing on which to lean . In the conduct of his own life , he had little use for clergymen , particularly Protestant clergymen , many of whom he regarded as nuisances . He had a large autographed photograph of Cardinal Hayes in the big room of his apartment in upper Fifth Avenue . It was so placed , whether intentionally or not , that it was one of the first objects that a visitor  --  let us say a potential big advertiser  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the outstanding rabbis . But what did Arthur Brisbane think ? About all that is known of that devious soul is that he had a sort of pat harangue , which he would deliver when the talk came around to the subject , in which he would argue that Nero , and not Christ , was probably the most admirable character in history . He would argue that Christ was an unhappy failure , and that Nero was not only successful but had a lot of fun . Much of this may be set down as sheer exercise in rhetoric . " Old Double Dome " could talk such stuff as well as he could write it , although he was not an effective public speaker . When making a speech he talked as if he were dictating into one of his machines . He was more at home in conversation . He could leap from one subject to another with the agility of a water bug . He had a good memory and a quick mind , but he was hardly well educated . His mental equipment was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up here and there in his headlong rush through life . He wrote much of evolution , physics , chemistry , astronomy , geology , but his facts were sometimes wrong , and his conclusions thirty years out of date . It was as if he had really stopped his educational processes with the books he had read back in the 90 's , although this was not entirely true of his material . He did read Sir James Jeans , and he was fascinated by the prophecies of J. B. S. Haldane as to the sort of world we would live in during the next few centuries . But for the most part , his thinking was outdated . He clung on to many of the same old reference books that had served him as a youth . Once , when he wrote solemnly that the female Gaboon viper , seeing her young ones in danger , would open her mouth and let them run inside , he was berated by herpetologists for his ignorance of the habits of the Gaboon viper . He replied simply that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too old to give up " one of life 's cherished delusions , " and that he was going to continue believing it . Occasionally he would put forth a suggestion calculated to aid people in reaching the more abundant life . He recommended that motorists , when starting on a long journey , carry along a Toggenburg nanny goat in a box . When night came , he suggested , the goat could be milked , then tethered by the roadside to graze . In the morning , more goat milk , and another happy day . He spoke sharply of Americans who were not sufficiently goat-conscious . One story about this goat article is that he really believed it was a good idea ; another , more credible , is that he had a large number of Toggenburg goats on his big farm at Allaire , New Jersey , and wanted to get rid of them . Brisbane had little use for men in public life  --  politicians , police commissioners , bosses , or what not . He had been through disillusioning experi ences in campaigns to elevate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , as in 1932 , when he wrote , just before the Democratic National Convention , that the party was ruined and could never elect another candidate , unless it nominated Al Smith . As a general rule , he did not see how any officeholder could be honest . Once , in his presence , a friend praised the ability and probity of a man who had been making a good record in a New York office , and asked if the editor had ever met him . " Do n't want to meet him , " said Brisbane . " He could n't be straight . He could not have associated with the people he had to meet coming up and still be on the level . They 're all the same , in different degrees . " The Last Column The last months of Brisbane 's life were not altogether happy . Hearst had sent out orders that any editor had the right to refuse to print the Brisbane column , or to edit it . And his manifold enterprises were not going so well . Business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idiotic didos ; the world in general was askew . He was not well . For some time he had a habit of drinking a spot of brandy with his coffee , taking one lump of sugar in the belief that it would put a thin protective layer or fat around his heart . But the heart was acting up , and his throat was uncomfortable . Finally he took to his bed , but tried to keep the fact secret from the world and from the Hearst hierarchy . He talked more and more of the old days . He was , to the last , proud of his family , and hopeful that they would do great things . He was volubly fond of his son-in-law , a lean , energetic and attractive Texan , John Reagan McCrary , who had become one of the editors of the Mirror . It was McCrary who sat up late with Brisbane on Christmas Eve , 1936 . Brisbane had dictated his usual Christmas column , all but the last paragraph , when he had to give up . His son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like all his other Christmas columns  --  a ray of hope in a troubled world . Before he lapsed into a coma he turned his head to McCrary and quoted from Voltaire 's Candide : " All is for the best in the best of possible worlds . " He knew the time had come . He died before sunup . Condolences came from the rich and powerful , and from the glib yes-men who had sought his favors . The newspapers set to work to give him the final salute . The funeral was in the pseudo-Byzantine Protestant Episcopal Church of St. Bartholomew . The names of the notables present filled more than a column in the newspapers , and they were not all . Among them were his friends , as well as a sprinkling of those who had fought with him and on occasion reviled him in life . In the little group that went to the grave in New Jersey was William Randolph Hearst , who sat and watched it all , impassive as a basilisk . Some said that Brisbane left $30 , - 000,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began talking of the fabulous sum they would collect from the estate . They gloated too soon . The best information today is that he left only about $8,000 , - 000 . Not a staggering amount , but at least he did not leave the world as his father Albert had left it , broke and virtually forgotten  --  and serene .
