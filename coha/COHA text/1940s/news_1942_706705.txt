txt Castle Clinton Was Different I hope the plans which you have published for the restoration of the old Aquarium building as Castle Clinton take into consideration the fact that as Castle Clinton , 1812 , the structure had only one tier and no roof , the same as when it was finished in 1810 by Colonel Jonathan Williams and called Southwest Battery . In 1812 it was renamed in honor of Mayor Clinton . It was not until Congress ceded the building to the city eleven years later , in 1823 , that it acquired a roof and a second story . When finished in 1810 , and of course as Castle Clinton , it commanded thirty guns . It was so damp the gunpowder spoiled and the old fort never fired a gun . After it became a public aquarium the guns were sent over to Governors Island . IDA M. MELLEN . Brooklyn , Aug. 31 , 19,12.
