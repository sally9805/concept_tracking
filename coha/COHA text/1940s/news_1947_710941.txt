And their " something for nothing " sales promotions are hitting a high crescendo . When Mrs. Ruth Bubble of Fort Worth . Texas , shows up at the Duz " Truth or Consequences " radio show next Saturday night to reap her reward for unmasking " Miss Hush " . it will mark the high point ( so far ) of the dizziest " contest " gold rush this country has ever seen . Mrs. Subbie will garner : A Buick convertible , an airplane , $2.000 in cash . television set , house-full of furniture , diamond ring , jeweled wrist watch , trip to Hawaii , fur coat and other expensive knick-knacks . Flowered in the Depression " Contest " merchandising flowered in the depression ' 30s . It sagged during the war when there was little to sell . Since then it has conic back furiously . In October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 20 national contests running at the same time . The rush to give things away was so great people did n't have time to enter all the events . So total entries in some contests ran below returns a year ago . The contest field is spreading . No longer are its chief practitioners confined to makers of soap , toothpaste , breakfast cereal . newspapers , candy bars , shampoo and other low-priced consumer items . The night before Mrs. Subbie collects her bonanza , top officials of General Motors will be hosts at a banquet for 5.000 prize-winners of their own . For the best answers to " Why I like my job at General Motors , " 5.000 prizes are being given away , including 40 new automobiles , from Cadillacs on down . Winchell and W.C.T.11 . Walter Winchell has horned into the act with his essay contest " What is a communist ? " to raise funds for the Runyon cancer fund . The prize is a 510.000 mink coat . The Women 's Christian Temperance Union is sponsoring a similar contest on what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York 's glorified bargain basement . is putting up $5 merchandise certificates . Even habitual contest entrants are running contests of their own , offering home-made articles like quilts and bedspreads as prizes . David L. Harrington , vice president of the Reuben H. Donnelley Corp . which has made a profitable sideline of contest judging , says his firm handled 15 , - ; more contest mail than ever before in its history this year se ? ent3. - five contests have  --  poured between 25 million and 30 million entries into Donnelley s threejudging centers in Chicago , New York and Los Angeles . The prospects are , says Mr. Harrington , that next year will be even bigger as more companies seek to familiarize the public with their brand names and keep Up in the competitive sales race . Hui %e n't Seen Anything Yet " There is every indication that we have n't seen anything as far as contests and premium promotion are concerned , " a merchandising official for the Walgreen Co. says . the big drug chain benefits indirectly from contests through increased store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The principal purpose of a consumer contest , say merchandisers , is to get immediate action on sales by breaking down buyer inertia , the bane of all advertisers . They call it one of the best means ever devised to get customers to sample a product for the first time at their own expense . The alternative . a " give-away " sample program , is many times more costly , and almost impossible on a national basis Contest managers also talk of the " free ride " they get in advertising and publicity from newspaper editors and radio stations while a contest is on . A. C. Nielson Co. , which makes continual checks of several thousand drug , food , variety and department stores to prepare confidential reports to manufacturers of drug and grocery products , says that sales figures for a particular brand always show a spurt when a contest is held . However . accenting to Mr. Nielson , sometimes the hyperdermic injection lasts . sometimes it does n't . The Pepsodent division of Lever Bros. earlier this year sponsored the most effective contest of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which attracted over 3,600,000 entries . Pepsodent is a firm believer in contests , and has run une a year since the early ' 30s . It admits that sales slide off after a contest , and judges the effectiveness of its promotions by whether the new post-contest sales rate tops the pre-contest volume . Pepsodent is understood to be readying for a new contest next spring . The tremendous post-war growth of the contest mechanism as a means of restoring brand name consciousness in the minds of consumers has made a big business out of contest judging Most big national contests average around four weeks and are timed for either spring or fall months , when the public apparently has the most time for preparing entries The four basic types of contexts involve : ( 1 ) jingles. 42 ) short essays , ( 3 ) naming contests , and ( 41 word building . The Jingle Does It Professor Lloyd Herrold , head of the advertising department at Northwestern University and Donnelley 's chief competitor as a contest judge , says that the jingle is now most popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entries on its previous essay contests , tried a jingle recently and drew 980.000 . A contest may bring a lot of trouble for the uninitiated Even Donnelley 's found this out during its early years in the business when it undertook to judge a ? ? . ord building contest without specifying what dictionary was to be used in scoring the ent.ries . Years of litigation ensued , while lawyers argued semantics and " what is a word " , before the courts dismissed a disgruntled loser 's case against the company . For just such oceurences . Donnelley 's carries insurance protecting contest sponsois against any contestant 's claim . Vrofesnional% Get Surprises Although most professional judging firms are able to roughly gauge in advance the number of entries for a contest , occasionally even the best of them are surprised . In an Allcia-Seltzer jingle contest two years ago , the experts were looking for about 500.000 entries . Instead , nearly 2,000,000 avalanched in and all radio and newspaper promotion had to be turned off three weeks ahead of schedule . Conversely . after the Bob Hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicize an almost identical contest campaign for another product . The returns were n't one-tenth as many . Because of the tremendous manual job of opening letters , sorting and other physical tasks , contest judging so far has been confined to large direct mail advertising firms . Donnelley 's has a labor pool of hundreds to call on at any time . Professor Herrold has an arrangement with R L. Polk &; Co , which processes his contest mail before turning itover for final judging . Only one major contest company , Procter &; Gamble , has its own fulltime contest staff . Three Levels of Judges On big national contests there may be three levels of judges before the top entries are narrowed down for the executive judges to pick the winner . With Donnelley 's all except the executive judges , who are Donnelley top officials , are recruited from English majors at nearby colleges ? University of Chicago . New York University and the University of Southern California  --  at about 81 en hour for part-time work . For the General Motors contest , because of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new set of judges , recruited from candidates for their doctorates in bustric 3 administration at Northwestern . The G.M. contest was a novelty in the field of personnel relations and apparently was ft success , attracting 175,000 entries out of the big corporation 's 290,000 employes . Unlike the entries of most consumer contests which are baled up and deposited in warehouses after the competition Is over . G M. personnel men expect to gain a new insight into their problems by cataloging and intensively studying the reasons why the entrants " liked their job at General Motors . " Other useful by-products of contests are extensile mailing lists ( sponsors are careful . here . however , for fear of causing ill-will ) and checks on the drawing power of different advertising media . Some sponsors specify that the entrants note on their letters a serial number , identifying the way they heard of the contest . These identifications are then separated by the judges and tabulated , providing a means of checking the effectiveness of advertising .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
