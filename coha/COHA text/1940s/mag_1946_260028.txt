Slender , kinky-haired Igor Loiewski-Cassini , who is a grandson of a Russian count , hit Manhattan last fall like a ton of marshmallows . He signed on as " Cholly Knickerbocker " of Hearst 's New York Journal-American society page , and set his sights high . What he wanted , he said , was syndication-first national , then global . He put out a highly readable , often unbearable column full of cream-puff crises and chichi . Sometimes , to angle it down Hearst 's alley , he sternly lectured his readers on why broiled squab and Valentina gowns were Worth Fighting For . <P> Last week Hearst 's King Features Syndicate bought a Cassini society column , but it was not Igor 's . The author : pretty , pouty Austine ( " Bootsie " ) Cassini , Igor 's 26-year-old wife . The title : Washington Whirl , to run thrice weekly in 100-odd papers , as a hodgepodge of capital chitchat , politics and favorite embassy recipes . <P> Brunette Bootsie started out as a leg-woman for her husband 's old column , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington Times-Herald . When Igor was drafted in 1943 , " Cissie " Patterson let Bootsie step in as his wartime substitute . Washingtonians liked the substitute better than the original : her stuff was not deep , but it avoided the catty approach that once got Igor tarred &; feathered ( TIME , July 3 , 1939 ) . As the daughter of an old and horsy Virginia family , in whose house Igor took refuge after being tarred , Bootsie had a better entry into Capital society than he did . <P> Cissie gave Bootsie a shrewd buildup , decorated the column each week with cuts of Bootsie in a different hat . As madly hatted as Hedda Hopper , Mrs. Cassini has a collection of 50 , mostly John-Frederics jobs , sometimes makes her own from pieces of curtain or lace tablecloths . <P> " Most of my work , " says Bootsie , " is done in bed . " There she breakfasts , reads the papers ( including the Journal-American , to see , as she says , what her husband has snitched from her column @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she starts a round of cocktail parties ( her drink : orange juice ) and dinners . At these gatherings she caches her notebook in the ladies ' room , makes frequent trips there to jot down the items she overhears . By 1 a.m. she is back in bed . Once a week she sees her husband , " Ghighi . " They meet in New York because , says Bootsie , " He does n't like Washington any more . . . he does n't think the people dress well here . "
