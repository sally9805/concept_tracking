txt Producers and merchants of coal have decided to quit twiddling while homes burn more and more competing fuels . They 're starting a drive for the new-homes market , with an annual 25 to 35 million tons of bituminous fuel at stake . This potential business ? as the coal men see it , is embodied in the 10 million homes which economists tell them will be built in this country during the next decade . To get a big slice of that business and to hang onto the market for domestic heating that it now has , the coal industry is revitalizing its entire merchandising program . America 's new homes will have to be heated with gas , with nil or with coal ; and unless the current trend is interrupted , coal will come out third best . That 's Why the incitistry 's leaders these days are making no effort to conceal their alarm . Admit Coal Trails in Competition .

They admit their selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frankly that their servicing methods , generally , have not been good . Burning equipment has been improved but still is not good enough , they say . In isolated areas , producers and merchants have cooperated to show that coal can hold its old markets and win new ones in domestic heating through smarter selling accompanied by better equipment and better servicing . The National Coal Association now proposes to consider the establishment of these programs on a nationwide and industry-wide basis , to attune their selling methods to the ! high tempo reached by coal research . A. membership meeting of the N.C.A. will , be held in Cleveland next month for that purpose . Association leaders say it will be the " most important gathering of coal men ever held in this country . " Millions of Tons In ? ohed " Millions of tons of coal that must be saved to the industry are Involved in the problems confronting us. " says a notice issued by the N C.A. " We believe a plan has been developed that will go far towards that end . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which producers , wholesalers and retailers will join to : 1 .

Improve public opinion of coal and the coal industry through retail dealers , whose service and advertising strongly affect the thinking of all coal consumers , domestic and industrial alike Something like this has been brewing among coal men for a long time while they have watched oil and gas briskly cutting into coal 's domestic heating market . Two recent studies have jolted them into a realization 01 their position . The information disclosed in the surveys is " alarming ' the N.C.A. says . Other Fuels Get Market Both reports draw dreary pictures for coal . One , made by the Association s marketing committee , points to the tremendous advances that have been made by gas and oil in the heating of homes , at the expense of coal . It warns the bituminous industry that it must fight as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competing fuels at a " ruinous rate " The other study , which is continuing , is devoted to the long-range economic problems of the industry from production on through to the delivery of coal to the curb It is on the basis of these reports that the industry is to undertake its cooperative merchandising project next month . It is aimed specifically at the rev , home market but is designed also to holster coal competitively in many other v ? ays . An example : 25 nullion tons of coal lost in the domestic heating market to gas and oil would be thrust back upon the industrial , railroad and by-products markets , which likewise are being constricted by gas , oil and hydroelectric competition . Thus , producers who do not ship to retailers are being reminded of the " tremendous " stake they too have in the domestic market . Want Coal in New Homes That 's why the coal producers are putting more steam in their droe to win Oter the owners of new homes , construction of which , they say . will create a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " provided we can maintain our appeal of economy , have improved burning equipment to offer , and , further , provided we go after it by aggresive merchandising " Here 's the way coal men look at it : Ten million new homes will he needed within the next 10 years : of these , will cost or sell for less than $8,000 : and 60 ' , - will cost or sell for 56.000 or less . Most of these homes will be built or sold to families with incomes under $5,000 per year Can they he saved for coal ? The coal people believe they can , with proper shipperretailer cooperation . They believe also that equipment and service can he demised to provide automatic heat with coal or coke for the more expensive homes that are to be built They cite these examples In Minneapolis and St. Paul , every one 250 homes in a new sub-division ( the homes costing $6,250 each ) has been equipped to burn solid fuels because an organization of dealers and producers called Better Home Heating .

Says the committee that made the marketing sum ev . " The significance of these two eases can not he - exageerated . Without these shim-Ito --  dealer organizations . these houses would have been lost to coal They constitute indisputable evidence that new homes in the lower-price brackets can be saved for coal by the proper efforts . Thousands upon thousands of new homes have been built in the past ten years and equipped to burn oil or gas , simply becaose no organized effort wits made to sell architects , builders or owners on the advantages of coal heat . " Higher Price Is Disathantage A distinct disadvantage to coal in many important consumirg areas . hoa ever , is price . Gas and oil have low labor costs compared with coal With pipe lines and water shipment , gas and oil also have an advantage in transportation costs . Gas and oil can effect price reduction with expanding volume . With high direct costs , coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Along the East Coast , coal merchants have been losing business to their oil competitors , since fuel oil was released from rationing and price reductions made in some areas . Rate of conversion from coal to oil there is expected to be accelerated as more oil-burning equipment becomes available . Gas pipe lines haunt the coal men . ? ? Mook where you will " they say in their marketing survey , " natural gas is being piped into our great industrial sections . not only taking industrial business at ridiculous . losing rates in order to get base loads , but also threatening to reduce domestic gas rates in order to build a tremendous volume of domestic heating . " Minneapolis is offered as an example of the tough gas competition . because that city requires permits for heating devices , and thus has records of the types of fuel to he used in installations of new burning equipment . In 1945 , mostly after V-E Day , applications were made in Minneapolis for permits to install 5.365 gas burners . 282 oil burners , and 479 coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stokers This is the kind of " alarming " information the N.C.A speaks of in its call to members to attend the meeting here . March 14 and 15 . It 's the kind of information that led the marketing committee to conclude : ? ? The coal industry has reached the crossroads . " The importance of getting the new home business has not turned coal men 's thoughts from the necessity of keeping the domestic heating business they now have . The business is sizable . This year the industry will ship about 12n million tons of bituminous to retail merchants . That will he between 20 ' , and 25M of the national production . But it will represent between 30 ? and 33 ' , of the annual income to producers . The 1940 census showed that coal was used to heat 11 million of the 14 million homes which had central heating plants . Wood was used for 373,000 , fuel oil for 1,100,000 ; gas for 1.109,000 ; other fuels for 272.000 . There were 19.630 000 homes which had no central heating plants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of these . 7 , - 600,000 used coal or coke : 7,250,000 used stood , 2.724,000 used gas ; 1.221.000 used fuel oil , 875,000 used kerosenee , gasoline or other fueLs . Whether that huge market for coal is to he retained , the marketing committee says . depends on the service that coal is prepared to offer . The committee observes that a good deal of improvement will have to be made if the market Is to he held .
