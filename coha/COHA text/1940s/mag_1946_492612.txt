82nd Airborne , Master of the Hot Spots lly MARTHA GELLHORN HERE are eighteen men in the plane , nine " facing nine on the chromium bucket . seats . k The plane is that valuable drayhorse of war , the twin-engined C-47 . Scores of other planes fly through the night and the wind , and in all of them sit the quiet men , heavy with equipment  --  rifle or tommy gun , ammunition , grenades , land mines , first-aid packets , rations and maps , perhaps a radio , a bazooka or a light machine gun as well-100 pounds or more to carry to the ground . This is the long last waiting , and their faces and their eyes are blank . What concerns each man now is entirely private , and his empty face guards him where he lives alone . The lucky ones sleep . After all , there is nothing to do but wait . Everything that can be known is known ; the mind only uses itself looking backward or forward ; it is good to sleep if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is expected of him and each knows the plan that directs them all . They know what can go wrong . They know a chute can fail to open  --  a " streamer , " they call it . They know a man can land and break his legs or his back ; or his neck , for that matter . They know a man can be shot as he floats to earth or hangs in a tree , a helpless target . They know for certain that , wherever they are dropped , the enemy will be all around them , waiting , and they can only hope that darkness and surprise will give them the edge of time they need . The moment for thinking and knowing is now past . The red warning light has flashed . The jumpmaster gives the command that belongs to them alone : " Stand up and hook up . " Seventeen men rise and fasten their static lines to the main cable . " Check your equipment ! " " Sound off for equipment check ! " " Number Ten okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The voices count off above the motor and the noise of the wind . " Are you ready ? " There is a full , roaring shout . Then the final words , " Let 's go ! " The officer disappears into the wide loud night ; men shuffle fast down the length of the plane ; hurry , hurry , the faster you get out the nearer you will be to your buddies when you land . On the night of July 9 , 1943 , paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne Division , forming a combat team under the command of Col. James M. Gavin , parachuted onto Sicily to spearhead the Allied seaborne invasion of that island . It was the first operation of its kind in the annals of the American Army . The 2nd Corps field order stating the object of this mission sounds deceptively simple : " ( 1 ) Land during night D-1/D in area north and east of Gela , capture and secure high ground in that area . ( 2 ) Disrupt communications and movement of reserves during night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H/1 hours on D day . ( 4 ) Assist 1st Infantry Division in capturing and securing landing field at Ponte Olivo . " Two hundred and twenty-two C-47 's left ten airfields near Kairouan , Tunisia , that night . The estimated flight time between Kairouan and the intended drop zone in Sicily was three hours and twenty minutes ; Malta was a landmark en route . Few saw Malta . A gale wind was blowing ; the low-flying planes were blown from their course in the dark ; there was no interplane communication ; navigation became highly confused . Flak added to the disruption , and finally the combat team , some 3000 strong , was dropped in dribbles over an area vastly more extensive than anyone had planned to cover . Furthermore , men were dropped on stone ridges , in olive groves , onto and around enemy pillboxes and barbed wire , and into the ocean . The Italian radio was so baffled by this dispersal that it announced " five and perhaps ten American paratroop divisions have landed in Sicily . " There began a brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few hundred paratroopers of all ranks attacked the enemy where found , as if this incredible dispersion had been the original plan . Capt . Edwin Sayre , a round-faced , black-haired Texas farmer , and Lt. Col. Arthur Gorham , a 28-year-old West Pointer , landed fairly near the planned drop zone ; they collected ninety-five men between them . This force took a fortified position and a wired and mined system of pillboxes , fought off two tank attacks , occupied the high ground north and east of Gela and prevented German reinforcements from using the one road which led to the American landing beach . Captain Sayre was seen leading his men with a grenade in one hand , a grenade in his teeth and a rifle in the other hand ; later he seemed to find the old Western style best , for he was using two pistols . Lieutenant Colonel Gorham was killed the next day by a direct shell hit while firing a bazooka at a tank . At 11:30 A.M. of D Day , scouts of the lot Infantry Division made contact with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the commanding general of the 82nd , Major General Ridgway , saying that the mission of the combat team was accomplished . The plans called for 3000 men to do what ninety-five , fighting like inspired lunatics , had done . Meanwhile the combat-team commander , Colonel Gavin , had dropped thirty miles from the drop zone with a force of two officers and three enlisted men . This group worked its way back to the Gela area ; en route they found Piazza Ridge , a spur of ground that commanded the juncture of the two American beachheads . This vital terrain was held by a reinforced battalion of the Hermann Goering Division , with another in reserve , and supporting tanks and artillery . From this position the Germans could split and flank the let and 45th Infantry Divisions , which were making the landings . On July eleventh , at ten in the morning , the battle for Piazza Ridge began , with 200 paratroopers supported by three light field guns , storming the hill . During the counterattacks which followed , German tanks rolled to within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shallow , hastily dug foxhole  --  troopers were crushed by tanks with their bazookas still in their hands ; one NCO and six men dragged a 75-mm. pack howitzer into the open and fired at point-blank range on the nearest German tank . For a while that slowed up the German attack . By four-thirty in the afternoon , forty-five troopers had been killed and 120 wounded ; the remaining handful planned to stay on that dusty hill among the little olive trees and fight until they died . Reinforcements of 125 men and a company of tanks arrived ; the troopers cheered the tanks and attacked again . During the night they got artillery support , and by midnight the ridge and the valley behind it were cleared . One paratrooper was clearly worth five of any other kind of man , and that included he other man 's artillery and tanks . The official report on Piazza Ridge says , laconically , " After burying the dead on the morning of the twelfth , the force proceeded toward Gela . " On D-1 , as planned , the 504th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their arrival in Sicily was one of those disasters which happen in war , and are generally passed over in sad and tactful silence . Flying in good weather and good formation , heading directly for their proper drop zones , they were suddenly fired on by one AmeriCan machine gun . It was what is called friendly fire . This error started all the guns along the coast , also friendly , and the antiaircraft guns on United States naval vessels lying offshore . Twenty-three planes were lost ; the formation was disrupted ; the paratroopers , some already wounded , were dropped as God willed . The enemy could do nothing worse . The 82nd Airborne , having accomplished its assigned mission and several more besides , rounded itself up and marched and fought its way across Sicily ; 150 miles in five days and five nights , with a bag of 23,191 prisoners . The troopers say that up around Trapani , ? where their Sicilian campaign ended , the wine was copious and the girls pretty , . and they lived in villas for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when you look back on it , they say , good old Sicily , those were the days . Between the end of the Sicilian campaign and the invasion of Italy , the staff of the 82nd had good reason to go collectively out of their minds . Six airborne missions were ordered by higher headquarters , thoroughly prepared and set up by the staff , and then canceled . The troops , too , who were being shunted about Sicily and North Africa , had cause to wonder . Of all these missions , the most splendidly E. Phillips Oppenheim was the planned jump on Rome . It had been decided to parachute units of the 82nd onto airfields at Rome coincidentally with the signing of the Italian armistice and the beach landings at Salerno . At the last moment , with the engines of the planes on the African airfields warming up , the great gamble was canceled . The Italian authorities in Rome could guarantee no support for the paratroopers . Finally , at the urgent request of Gen. Mark Clark , whose Salerno beachhead was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Infantry Regiments dropped just behind the beaches at Salerno ; the 325th Glider Infantry Regiment arrived by sea . For several days , two battalions of the 504th fought behind the beaches , though cut off and with no communication among themselves . General Clark later said this effort was " responsible for saving the beachhead . " The division led the 5th Army into Naples . Though elements of the division helped chase the Germans as far north as the Volturno River and others fought their way up into the mountains near Cassino , the real Italian veterans are the 504th Regiment , which spent two months on the flat marshland at Anzio . Even now , from the air , the Anzio beachhead looks like no other part of Europe ; the shellholes almost touch one another , raw and round , full of water . The few remaining trees stand like clawed telegraph poles ; there are no towns , but only jagged burned-out slabs of masonry . It was an old-fashioned war at Anzio , hosed on the fine example of Ypres and Passchendaele , when men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death by artillery . It was not a paratroopers ' war , but they tried to reform it . Among other efforts at improvement , Pvt . Ted Bachenheirner started his one-man intelligence service . ( Continued an Page 39 ) Ted spoke German , having been horn in Vienna , and at night he would crawl across the lines and attach himself to the end of a German chow line . He entered into amiable conversation , sometimes only for information , and sometimes he would bring back prisoners for identification . The same system worked well on enemy foxholes . In this division , for such work you do not get either promoted or decorated ; it is regarded as only normal that a man should think up useful gestures . Ted was captured and killed the next year , aged twenty-one , in Holland , while behind the enemy lines checking on a telephone line he had set up , so that he could get his information simply by *urging across to the other side . In a division made up of amazing characters , one can go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team , the moving spirits behind a battery located near Cisterna , only 100 yards behind our infantry outposts . These men lived in their received counterbattery fire every ten minutes and , as a sort of bonus , special extra shellings of 150 to 200 rounds . Men were wounded and killed every day in those cold wet mudholes , but the morale was held firm by a kid of twenty , called Sergeant McGee , whose life ambition was to go to college , and a middle-aged man of twenty-two , called , Lieutenant Swope , whose only known ambition was to keep the battery firing and stay alive , if possible , and an old man of twenty-nine , called Captain Morehouse , who wanted to study medicine when all this foolishness was over . They were all mild-mannered , quiet types and they saw nothing remarkable about their thirty-seven-day vigil . No one who was not there can quite . inagine what the war in Italy was like ; ' It was always an orphan sort of war , and as it went on and on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was n't the flat deadly stalemate of Anzio , it was fighting up more mountains , always higher , always farther , always colder , with the enemy , well entrenched , waiting as long as possible , only to retire to the next range . And everywhere there was the gnawing menace of mines . The division , wiser and fewer , set sail for England in November , 1943 , leaving the 504th at Anzio . Two months later , when the 504th left Anzio , a third of the regiment had become casualties on that filthy little strip of land . They were very glad to go . During the winter of 1944 the division was stationed near Leicester , England . To hear the kids talk of Leicester , you would think it was a combination of Venice , Paris and home . For , after all , they had seen nothing to date except home and a lot of ruins . In Leicester people spoke almost understandable English and were friendly , clean and civilized . The troopers gave the girls their glider wings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and went jitterbugging at the Palais de Danse . They polished their boots until they shone , pressed their baggy pants , set their high-peaked caps at the fashionable angle , and strolled the streets ; for , in the language of the day , they are very sharp troops and they take the greatest pleasure in this . Some 12,000 of them , experienced soldiers , and younger than you would believe , took over that corner of England , and the English actually liked it . There were a certain number of pub fights and a certain amount of resultant , disciplinary action . The English accepted all this calmly . If you take very young men and teach them to hold their lives lightly and to kill , and then expect them to go out and kill in your behalf , you ca n't be indignant if they raise some hell outside the combat zone . They were having a wonderful time , but they did not think Leicester was journey 's end . They had proved the value of an airborne division , and the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised to learn that they would be the first men in Normandy . There was a moon that night . The planes mounted and circled with their wing lights close , and slowly the long sky train straightened out and headed for France . Those who were part of it said it was beautiful ; in daylight , the sea , solid with ships , was beautiful too . That giant departure of men for the invasion of Normandy was a terrible and handsome sight . By eleven o'clock on the night of June fifth , all 378 planes , carrying 6396 paratroopers , had left the fields of England . This was Task Force A , led , as before , by James Gavin , now a brigadier general . When his men landed in the fields , orchards , marshes , and rivers of the Cherbourg Peninsula , the long last battle of the war began . As the planes approached the coast of France , fountains of flak spurted up against them . It takes fine and steady pilots to fly the slow , vulnerable transports through that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but most of them made it . Bill Walton reports a fragmentary amazing conversation in his plane , between men shuffling to the open door . " Please do n't shove me ; I 'll go quickly . " . . . " Okay , do n't shove me either . " Ste. Mere Eglise was the first town in France to be liberated . It was taken at four-thirty a . M. by elements of Task Force A. The citizens of Ste. Mere Eglise were astounded and delighted by this honor . True , some of the paratroopers who had landed right in their village were shot by the Germans while they hung suspended in the trees around the market place ; and , true , there was heavy firing in the fields outside their town . But they were free ; the war was evidently almost over . In the clear light of noon , the Germancounterattack hit Ste. Mere Eglise . German artillery zeroed in , and suddenly the quiet village became a shambles of broken trees and houses , dead cattle , dead people , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their kisses were different men now , silent and fast , doing what they had to do . The villagers hid in ditches in the fields , and all around them was the violent woodpecker noise of machine guns , the sudden thud of mortars and the fast sharp whine of 88 's . There were gray German dead , and American boys , flat and empty as the dead are , with blood and dirt on those little flags that had looked so charming sewed to their sleeves . There 40 TILE SATURDAY EVENING POST Ftdwunry 23,1916 were burned-out German tanks and burned bodies and all the wild wastepaper of war that seems to grow from every battlefield . Their town had been liberated , and the paratroopers kept it free ; everyone paid for that freedom . At H+4 and until nightfall of D day , the gliders landed , bringing with them , besides much-neededmen , m uch-needed medical supplies and antitank guns and howitzers . The gliders crashed into the hedgerows that lined the too-small fields , into houses , barns , churches ; and the Germans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the night  --  were ready for them . The medics found themselves landed in marshes where the water was from three to seven feet deep ; under shellfire and small-arms fire , they ferried their equipment out on life rafts and set up a tent hospital within two hours . In an airborne operation , the troops are necessarily surrounded , so the safest place to put a hospital is at the center of the fighting . The hospital was less than a mile from the front , and the front was circular . There are some simple eyewitness accounts of Normandy , written by paratroopers of the 508th , a new regiment attached to the 82nd Airborne Division , which was introduced to war in Normandy . Here are two brief heartfelt samples . Pvt . M.G. Thomas reported : " June sixth was the biggest day of my life . It was D day for me and all of the Airborne . I was quite scared , but not as much as I thought I would be . Finally the time came . The jumpmaster said , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go when we were hit by flak . We were all knocked down . We got up , except for the wounded man , who could n't move . When the last man had left , the wounded trooper got to the door somehow and followed him out . . . . The night was beautiful . I did n't like to see our boys being shot in their chutes while still in the air . . . stayed in a ditch for a while , until some troopers came along . We continued to move until daylight , when we were boxed in by enemy fire . The Germans spotted us and began firing on the ditch where I was hiding . One of the boys carried a prayer book . He asked us to say a prayer , but I told him I did n't know a prayer . All I could say was , ' God , if You could ever do anything for me , please do it now , as I need it . ' .. . We started out of there and kept moving until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were ordered to take a town . We took the town and held out there until the troops reached us from the beach . We had lost some men , but the Germans lost three to our one . . . I hope every general is as much of a man as General Gavin proved he was in combat when he led us in such a victory . " Cpl . Jules Stollock writes of a friend : " He was only eighteen . The men in his company used to call Pvt . Tony Vickery the ' Milk-Bar Commando ' ? milk shakes being his strongest and favorite drink . As for women , he did n't have any . His mom , hack in Georgia , was his only and best girl . . The jump was uneventful , except for flak and a few ambitious jerries on the ground . . . Out of the entire planeload , Tony came across one man , and together they started off in the direction of the drop zone . On the way they picked up eighteen more troopers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about twenty-five or thirty jerriee . Daylight made it necessary for them to take cover and dig in , but Tony stayed on the alert . His vigil was not wasted , for not more than six hundred yards away a skirmish line at German grenadiers broke out of a wooded area and advanced on the troopers ' positions . He waited until the jerriea were about fifteen feet away before he squeezed the trigger of his tommy gun . The fight lasted about twenty-five minutes , and when the smoke cleared away , he lay in a heap at the bottom of the ditch . Four slugs from a machine pistol got him in the throat . If you looked on the other side of the hedgerow , you would have seen the bodies of at least thirty-three dead Germans , and the kid got every one of them . " Thirty-three days after the division landed in Normandy , it took ship for its base in England . During those thirty-three days , without relief or replacements , they had engaged five enemy divisions and were credited with destroying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divisions . More than 11,700 men of the 82nd Airborne Division bad come to Normandy ; there were 5429 men left to return . In August , back in England , Maj. Gen. Matthew Ridgway , who had commanded the 82nd ever since it became an airborne division in 1942 , was promoted , and Brigadier General Gavin was given the division , and the division is truly his . Nothing written about the 82nd would be complete without some account of this man whom his soldiers always refer to as " Slim Jim " or " General Jim . " James Gavin began his Army life at seventeen , when he exaggerated his age and enlisted . From the ranks be got to West Point , where he had always intended going in the first place . At thirty-eight he is one of the youngest major generals in the United States Army ; he is also the outstanding student and innovator of airborne warfare . To his men , he is one of them . They believe in him because he always jumps out of the lead plane first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he drives them relentlessly and gets results of which they are fiercely proud , because he has dignity , but no pomp , and any man can be sure of his consideration and his justice . They also like the cocky way he wears his hat , the fact that he is tall and thin , and has a charming Irish face , and the way he laughs . He has another quality soldiers admire very much : luck . They talk about him a great deal with a port , of possessive pride , and they enjoy repeating all the Gavin legends . The legends happen to be true , which makes them better . They will tell you about a trooper on patrol before the lines in the snowy confusion of the Bulge ; a tall dark figure loomed up aryl was challenged ; the trooper was ready to be the first man shooting , He was answered in the calm , well-known voice of the general . " Hello , son . How 's everything out here ? " The chief of staff , Colonel Wienecke , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system worked out ; I stay home with the telephones , and my general goes out and fights with the troops . " It is a good sight to see the general with his soldiers ; the way they salute him is like shaking hands . General Gavin chose a staff which perfectly suited him and his division . The oldest of his famous three G 's Colonels Ireland , Norton and Winton all formerly field officers in the . regi ments , is now twenty-eighe . ' In t ' galaxy of brain , beauty and youth , th chief of staff , who is all of forty-one , has a tendency to regard himself as the Rock of Ages . After Normandy , all the high Allied brass was definitely sold on airborne operations . The troops were wonderful , , the leadership stupendous , and men falling out of the sky could do anything ; whereupon it was decided to send the biggest airborne fleet yet , in daylight , to Holland to flank the Siegfried Line and get to the heart of Germany the quick way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flying at a fixed altitude in formation , passed for three hours over enemy-held Holland , while the amazed citizens on the ground below waved and cheered and believed the whole thing was an act of God . The first regil ment of the 82nd dropped south of Nijmegen at one P.M. ; the last regiment dropped at 1:28 P.M. By eight-thirty that night the initial missions of all three regiments had been completed . Three days later , after fighting off six major counterattacks , the 82nd held Nijmegen securely and was ready to take the great bridge over the Wash This was the road for the British 2nd Army to reach Arnhem , the key point 1 of the whole invasion . The Waal is a very un-European river , being wide , swift and deep , and the road bridge across it is the longest span bridge in of the 504th attacked German armor of the let S. S. Panzer Division at Cheneux by jumping on the vehicles and killing the crews with rifle butte , grenades and knives . These were the Nazi elite who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named for Adolf Hitler , and on this day they lost an entire battalion . It was the first victory in the Battle of the Bulge ; until then , the Germans had been doing the destroying . And there is the story of how the 505th counterattacked for three days and nights without overcoats and blankets , and nothing to eat except cold rations . At night they could not light fires , so they huddled together for warmth , and if they did not move , their feet froze . It was a long battle and a terrible one ; after the German drive was stopped , it had to be forced back . By February , the 82nd Airborne was racing the let Division for the Siegfried Line . They had helped save the trapped American divisions in the St. Vith pocket ; they had held their long front ; and now , with the 325th Glider Infantry spearheading , they counterattacked in three feet of snow and drove their way through the Siegfried Line . So at last they could go home . They returned to Sissonne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began writing those letters soldiers write : " Dear Mom : I am well . We been up in the snow about two months . It sure was cold . " I saw one impressive award of decorations during the war . This was when the division was holding a twenty-five-mile front along the Rhine opposite the Ruhr pocket . The award took place on a street in a town near Cologne . It was a short street with mediocre stucco houses lining it , and there were festoons of fallen telephone wire and broken bricks and smashed windows and a few shell holes . Looking at it , you felt angry with boredom , wondering why you ever had to see places like this , why there were Germans to live in such stupid , ugly houses , why anyone bothered to go on doing anything . The day was like that too . March , I think , colorless and belonging to no season of the year . In the street , at attention , stood six men ; their faces were as gray as the street , dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a smear of dried blood on one man 's sleeve ; he had probably lifted a wounded comrade . The general stood in front of them , grave and tired , too , and a young officer read the citations in a droning voice while nobody listened . There was no one to watch , no music , no flags ; just the empty street and the occasional sound of mortar fire from the river , and the men almost swaying with weariness as they stood . Then the general pinned the Silver Star on each man 's chest , they shook hands , they saluted . The men 's eyes were all far away , as if they did not see or recognize this street and had other things to look at . They waited for a moment , awkwardly , and then turned to go somewhere else  --  to their billets , anywhere a man could sleep . During the war , decorations did not seem to matter so much . They were always nice things to have , but the people who counted knew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell about men by the way they handled themselves and by all the things they did not say . But now that the war is over , everyone seems to set great store by decorations , so for the record , let it be noted that the 82nd Division has not only covered itself with glory but has been given an enor mous amount of silk and enameled metal in token thereof . For gallantry in action , the entire division has been awarded the orange lanyard of the Netherlands Willem ! ' Orde , which is the Dutch V.C. , and the red-and-green Belgian fourragere . The boys look very handsome with these bright cords on both shoulders . There is also a French citation for gallantry in Normandy , and all units of the division have at least one presidential citation . Individually , there are forty-two British decorations , beginning with the coveted D.S.O. ; fifty-three French decorations ; fourteen Russian decorations , which look like crown jewels ; seventy-three Dutch decorations , including the Grand Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau , conferred on General Gavin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person not of royal blood . There are two Congressional Medals of Honor , one Distinguished Service Medal , seventy-nine Distinguished Service Crosses , thirty-two Legion of Merits , 894 Silver Stars and 2478 Bronze Stars . No one has bothered to list the Purple Hearts ; 12,604 men have been wounded while fighting with the 82nd Airborne Division in six campaigns . Aside from one amphibious operation to the east bank of the river , life along the Rhine during the last spring of the war was not too grim . There were men wounded every day , and some killed , but in comparison with everything that went before , this was vacation . The warriors of E Company , of the 32561.1 Glider Infantry , set up their headquarters in a Cologne candy factory , where they lived in childhood 's dream among bins of almonds , milk chocolate , brown sugar and neatly wrapped hard candies . Then someone located a storehouse where the Germans kept looted cheeses the size of spare tires . Needless to say , wine was found , too , and , later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , black-silk top hats began to appear in quantity ; Germans seem to own top hats the way other people own radios . And bicycles were discovered . It was no unusual sight , along the river front , to see a paratrooper patrolling on a bicycle , wearing a top hat . Everyone agreed that if war was no worse than this , people would not mind taking a chance on it . Then the division moved north to the Elbe , to join the British in the last battle of the war . One regiment ferried across the Elbe to attack , while the rest of the division was still in trains and trucks , hurrying to get there . At the very end of the war your heart and your nerves told you to put your feet down carefully , to walk with all due caution and to keep your neck well in , for the bloody business was almost over and , having made it so far , it would be really wasteful to die now . Everyone felt this , whether admitted or not . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they always had , with the same momentum and the same directed recklessness . They finished their war very fittingly . An entire German army , 144,000 men , surrendered to General Gavin and the 82nd Airborne Division . In due course , the 82nd Airborne Division arrived in Berlin , where it was the occupying force . All traces of combat had been removed and they were the nattiest troops in the ETO . They turned out an honor guard company decorated with white scarves , gloves , bandoleers and bootlaces which drilled like the Rockettes , and dazzled visiting dignitaries . Berlin was fun . This was the end of the journey : the troopers meant to enjoy themselves . The fact that Berlin was a huge ruin did not affect them ; they had seen plenty of ruins , German-made . When the division arrived in New York last month  --  there was a parade and they were feted as heroes  --  there were few of the old men left . There are only twelve men in the 82nd now who wear four combat-jump stars on their parachute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember , the feeling of loneliness begins . So many dead , and so many who started straight and young and will not have whole bodies again . Any man who went through part of those 371 days of combat will never be the same ; he may forget what changed him , but the change is there . There is also something special and very good that remains . You feel it in this letter from a paratroop lieutenant to General Gavin : " For myself , as well as all those others in the division who remember the roar of planes at night , the instant when the warning light flashes on , and the magnificence of night skies full of swaying chutes , I want to say this : We hope with all our hearts that there will always be an 82nd . If we can know that somewhere young men will dare the challenge to ' stand up and hook up ' and know the moment of pride and strength which is its reward , then a part of us will always be alive .
