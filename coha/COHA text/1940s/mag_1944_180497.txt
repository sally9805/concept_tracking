Hiding by day , riding by night , the Japanese last week ground out new and ominous gains in their China offensive-the greatest land campaign ever fought by the men from the little island empire . Although the nearest battlefield was almost 350 miles from Chungking , the atmosphere in the capital was heavy with disaster . The Jap drive was a new and terrible threat to the very heart of Free China , the stronghold area lying in a quadrilateral between Chengtu , Chungking , Kweiyang and Kunming . <P> The enemy was not attempting a Blitzkrieg . Rather his strangling assault was a slow , ponderous , Montgomeryesque offensive which wound up laboriously , smashed ahead for carefully calculated distances with irresistible force , then paused to crank up again for the next lunge . <P> The enemy moved little over main roads ; these were still being ripped by " the few " of Major General Chennault 's air force . Instead , he wormed ahead on footpaths between the yellow-stubbled nee fields , on mule trails through the hills , and-most of all-on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks overhung by trees . <P> Even in the main corridor , from Yochow and Hankow , through Changsha and Hengyang , down which the enemy was funneling his attack groups and supplies , he was subject to harassment by Chinese guerrilla bands . But these attacks were pinpricks against the flank of an armored monster . <P> Scorched Airfields . In skillfully coordinated pincers drives the Japanese sent a powerful column from Canton up the West River . With their garrison divisions leavened by 20,000 freshly landed reinforcements , the Japs made good time , taking Wuchow and pressing on to Tan-chuk , most important of the Fourteenth Air Force bases southeast of the Heng-yang-Nanning line . Like the great U.S. base at Kweilin , built by the hand labor of thousands of Chinese , Tanchuk was scorched by Chennault 's airmen before they left it . <P> Meanwhile , the northern arm of the pincers thrust out three fingers to grasp Kweilin itself . To the Chinese its loss seemed inevitable . Far more disturbing now was a new threat to another of the Fourteenth 's bases ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kweilin . <P> But gravest of all was the threat of the western finger , resting on Paoching and pointing across the Kweichow plateau to the Fourteenth 's great central bases at Kweiyang and Kunming . <P> Even if the Japanese should push westward only to Kweiyang , 300 miles from Paoching , they would sever the main highways by which the Chinese and their allies had hoped to move war supplies into China from the new Ledo-Burma Road , through Kunming to Chungking . Across the plateau to the highways wove countless secondary roads and paths , along which the Japs had learned to route their advance . <P> The Great Trek Resumed . On all these roads and paths last week , millions of China 's sorely beset coolies , tradespeople and artisans poured westward , seeking the safety which for so many years has eluded them like a mirage . China 's exhausted , tattered soldiers fingered their last handfuls of cartridges , momentarily expecting attack by enemy patrols . Red-eyed , grimy American ground crewmen worked around the clock to keep Chennault 's planes flying .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
