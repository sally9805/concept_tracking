" Let the people of Yugoslavia know , " said Joseph Stalin 's government last week in a diplomatic note to Josip Broz Tito 's government , " that the Soviet Union looks on the present Yugoslav regime not as a friend and ally but as an enemy . . . Tito is more &; more joining up with imperialist circles against the U.S.S.R. " <P> The note was the fourth in a high-pitched controversy about Yugoslavia 's territorial demands on Austrian Carinthia , which Russia first backed , then repudiated ( TIME , June 27 ) . Europe 's rumor factories at once produced pertinent whispers : a Soviet airlift across Yugoslavia was reinforcing isolated little Albania " ; Marshal Ivan S. Konev was in Bulgaria warming up a Cominform army of 150,000 . <P> The fact was that now both sides had used just about all the strong language in the book . There was not much more that Stalin and Tito could tell each other - in words .                  @ @ @
