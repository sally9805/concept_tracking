txt EVICTION PROVISION IN CITY RENT LAW DECLARED INVALID Brooklyn Supreme Court Finds Statute Superseded  --  Order Stayed for Appeal A vital provision of the city 's rent control law that requires a landlord to obtain a certificate of eviction from the Temporary . City Housing Rent Commission was declared invalid yesterday in a Supreme Court ruling in Brooklyn . In granting an order of man-damus ' directing . a Municipal Court justice to issue a warrant of eviction , Justice Meier Steinbrink held that that section of the law superseded the Civil Practice Act , a general statute governing summary proceedings in the lower courts . The court , however , stayed execution of the order pending final determination of an appeal by the Appellate Division , Second Department , provided the appeal is prepared for the next available term of the tribunal . The law under attack is Local Law 66 , which relates , in general , // to conditions to be niet by landlords before instituting eviction proceedings . It provides that " no tenant shall be removed from any apartment by action or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or otherwise " lunless the commission issues a certificate certifying that one or more grounds for eviction exists . " The primary purpose of Local Law 66 is to restrict evictions from apartments , " Justice Steinbrink said . " The effect of this law , if upheld , would be to defeat or delay the institution or prosecution of thousands of summary proceedings which are already pending in. the courts or with reference to which many more thousands of applications for certificates are now pending before the commission . " Asserting that the city can not make regulations . " inconsistent with the laws of the state , " the opinion held that the local law was not " compatible with the provisions of the Civil Practice Act in so far as it assumes to impose restrictions upon the rights of liti , gants to bring actions and pro ' ceedings in the courts to recover possession of dwelling space . " " Without in any way disparaging the motive of the municipal law makers , it is enough to say that their powers must be exercised la a manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? City Home Rule Law , " Justice Steinbrink found . " The attempt made to legislate in a field which has been preempted by the state.was not a valid exercise of local : legislative power . " " Power of Courts " Seen To uphold the provision , the court continued , would be tantamount to granting to a local administrative body , such as the rent commission , th%. power of . " duly constituted courts ? with the - right to determine . whe , . her litigants could avail themselves of the courts to recover possession of real property . The decision stems from . ikii action brought in ** of Ai Bert Tartaglia of 492 President Strest , Brooklyn , who sought the eviction of James Kelly , his wife , and their seven children . The Kellys occupy a one-family house at 125 Berkeley Place , Brooklyn . The respondent in the proceedings , Municipal Court Justice Harold J , , had directed on Sept. 18 that Mr. Tartaglia comply with the requirements of the new local law , commonly known as the Sharkey Rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Temporary City .1. , : . : , : ; - ; i ng Rent Commission , created to a : : - .. linister the regulations . Justice made the condition as , a prerequisite to the issuance of a warrant , even though he had issued previously a final order awarding possession to Mr. Tartaglia . The lower court 's action was hailed by thousands of families against which eviction proceedings had been started before the city rent law was passed because Justice 's ruling held that a landlord who had obtained a final order of eviction before Sept. 17 , the effective date of the Sharkey law , nevertheless must get a certificate from the commission before evicting a tenant . Statement by . Board Head Paul L. Ross , chairman of the City Rent Commission , issued the following statement last night regarding the rent control decision by Justice Meier Steinbrink in Brooklyn Supreme Court : " I have just learned from newspaper reporters of Justice Steinbrink 's ruling in the case of Tartaglia versos " Kelly . I have not seen Justice Steinbrink 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that local law 66 is in part invalid and granted the application ? before him , he stayed his order pending determination of an appeal to the higher court . " The effect of this ruling , and the evident intent of Justice Steinbrink , is that local law 66 which deals with evicition proceedings , will continue in full force and effect until its validity has been determined by the Appellate Courts . Until such time , the commission will administer local law 66 and process applications for certificates of eviction as it has in the past . Landlords are cautioned to comply with the requirements of that law or regulation will be prosecuted by the City Rent Commission . " Mr. Ross added that " Justice Steinbrink 's opinion apparently deals only with Local Law 66 and does not relate in any way to the other rent control laws , Local Laws 54 , 67 and 68 . " Mr. Ross also declared that Mayor O'Dwyer had directed him and the city rent commission to take all necessary steps to maintain the validity of the city rent laws until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Appeals .
