Farming is a business that changes slowly - except in wartime . This year 's seed catalogs , agriculture college bulletins and reports of new research tell an exciting story of improved plants that promise higher yields of foodstuffs and fodder , of forgotten crops returning to favor , of drug plants formerly imported , now vital crops in the U.S. <P> There are new kinds of soybeans with a higher oil content than the old . An improved alfalfa resists wilt . Two brand-new types of red clover can yield a ton more of hay an acre than the old , once-popular ordinary variety that fell into disfavor because it was not winter hardy . A Canadian wild rye , new as a forage crop , promises heavier yields than the common meadow grass . Flax , a minor crop until 1942 , is getting a tremendous boost from the introduction of machines to handle it . Hybrid corn , no newcomer in the Middle-west , is being improved for use all through the U.S. ; this year it has extra importance because it has all but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> There are odd plants unimportant in acreage but vital in the war : quick-growing Russian dandelions for rubber , cattails and milkweed to be used as filler in life preservers , henbane used as a sedative . <P> Department of Agriculture plans call for 500 acres of belladonna to be planted this year in east central states , notably Pennsylvania . In 1939 scarcely a handful of belladonna seed could be found in the U.S. , but that was carefully grown and made possible a good 1942 crop whose product , used for surgical therapy , was above U.S. Pharmacopoeia standards . <P> Most sizable of the new crops is hemp , which will be grown this year on 350,000 acres in the midwest . To prepare for the new crop some 35,000 acres of hemp were grown in Kentucky and harvested for seed last year . For processing the hemp into badly needed ships ' rope the Department of Agriculture is financing the construction of 71 midwest factories . Hemp was a big U.S. staple even before the Revolution , was used for homespun garments , twine , sacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign competition half century ago killed U.S. hemp production . Now Agriculture Secretary Claude Wickard has listed it as a vital war crop . <P> About such developments are U.S. farmers reading these winter nights . And with reason : here might well be the shape of things to come , a key to post-war stability better than any program out of Washing ton , far better than habit-forming reliance on wheat-corn-cotton.
