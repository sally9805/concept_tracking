txt Tax Stamps as Inflation Curb To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Among the objectives of the Federal Government are ( 1 ) reducing purchasing power to prevent inflation , ( 2 ) increasing tax receipts , and ( 3 ) promoting savings . These could be accomplished by adopting a stamp tax on sales . For example , there could be a tax at the rate of 5 cents on the dollar added to the total of all sales and stamps given for the amount of the tax . These stamps could then be exchanged at postoffiees for United States Savings Stamps to a value of 50 per cent of the amount of the tax stamps surrendered . This would accomplish the threefold purpose of increasing the amount paid for merchandise without increasing its cost , adding to the tax revenue at the rate of 21h per cent and promoting the sale of savings stamps at the rate of 21/2 per cent of all sales .
