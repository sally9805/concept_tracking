txt // do not live in the same world as the satires of Dryden , or Pope , or Marvell . His tragedy Valentinian was adapted from Fletcher . Rochester 's authentic works were not completely collected till the present century . Sir Charles Sedley ( 1639 ? 17o1 ) was rich as well as accomplished , and outlived his dissipated youth , to become the friend and champion of William III . As a poet , he followed obediently the fashion of the time . His lyrics are pleasant , and little more . Phyllis is my only joy is the one clear survival . The reputation of Charles Sackville , Lord Buckhurst and their Earl of Dorset ( 1638-1706 ) , is a puzzle of literary history . An age lavish of panegyric exhausted in his praise all its powers of flattery . Yet when we turn from the encomiasts to the poet 's own works , we find them to be no more than what Johnson called them , " the effusions of a man of wit " . No poem of his really survives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Land , and his authorship of even that is disputed . There is nothing more to say about a poetical reputation as lightly earned as any we know . John Sheffield ( 1684-1721 ) , Earl of Mulgrave , later Marquis of Normanby and Duke of Buckingham , was neither an amiable person nor a tolerable poet . Those who wish to study the " art of sinking " in couplets can be recommended to his most important poem , An Essay on Poetry , for that purpose , but for no other . His Essay on Satire , which cost Dryden an encounter with Rochester 's hirelings , has the accent of the scold in every line . Sheffield 's poetical flight and political career were equally low . Wentworth Dillon , Earl of Roscommon ( 1633-85 ) , nephew of tl great Strafford , meddled in the affairs of court as little as he practis its vices . He was an honest man and perhaps something of a pri A friend of Dryden , he engaged that great man 's sympathy for l favourite project , the founding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard of our language " . His Essay on Trap lated Verse is just such a poetic exercise as might have been read befo such a body . Nevertheless , a reading of that poem will disclose t unexpected source of many familiar quotations . Horace Roscominon 's master , and the disciple 's version of the Art of Poe is attractively personal . Roscommon was among the first of I time to discover the greatness of Milton , and one of many who ha tried to reproduce in English the plangent harmonies of Dies Irae . We must beware of supposing that the fashionable court po represent the whole spirit of Restoration England . Sound and serious work in art and science , as well as in literature , was done during period too often dismissed as trivial . Purcell , Wren and Newt are as much a part of their age as Rochester , Musgrave and Do Dryden alone would make it illustrious . // CENTURY The first Elizabethan poets , disliking the popular doggerel of the early Tudor dramatists , sought to bring back order into verse by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own lines to move in a steady iambic tramp " from short to long " ; the other was an attempt to fix upon English syllables the measures of classical prosody . Harvey , Sidney and Spenser pursued the classical ideal in theory ; Stanyhurst proved it impossible in practice . But the ancient hope dies hard ; and quantitative English hexameters have been attempted even in the twentieth century , although the fact is obvious that the English ear , metrically keen , does not recognize " short and long " , as such , in English , even when assisted by orthography . The English ear has a different kind of habituation . So the classical method of restoring order to verse failed ; and modern English poetry began its march to glory with the tramping " left , right " of poulter 's measure in Tottel 's Miscellany . What is very odd is that while Tudor poetry seemed to have fettered itself with a two-foot movement , Tudor music had attained the chainless liberty of what we now call " free verse " . Music , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-meaning editors have ruined its flexibility by ing it up in the regular bars of the classical period . The later Elizabethan poets and their successors caught the lilt of music , and then musician and poet were combined in one person , as in Thomas Campion , the lyric was set at liberty . Another great factor in the liberation of English verse was blank crse , especially the blank verse of drama . Alike in Surrey 's Aeneid id in our first blank-verse tragedy , Gorboduc , the lines are undeviating in their tramp from short to long . But the authors of Gorboduc were not really dramatists . Real dramatic verse is a kind of song , not a kind of back-chat prose , a fact that producers rarely recognize . Not many more than thirty years lie between Gorboduc I Romeo and Juliet ; yet it is already clear that such lines as Romeo 's Tell in the tomb can not be forced into the unvarying pattern of Gorboduc ; and the impossibility is clearer still when we come a little er to Hamlet . Nevertheless behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ghostly pattern of archetype , ruling them not to venture too far . Shakespeare 's successors did ture too far , especially in their addition of redundant syllables , it their alleged blank verse became a kind of slovenly prose , fitfully metrical and utterly pedestrian . In short , dramatic blank was reverting to the doggerel out of which it was digged. lyrical poetry shows a steady advance because there was a steady // advance in lyrical poets . Place side by side any blameless effusion from Tottel 's Miscellany and such a song as Take , 0 take those lips away , or Queen and Huntress , chaste and fair , and the superiority of the later verse as verse is as clear as the superiority of the later poem as poem . The Jacobean and Caroline lyrists kept their inventions at the height , whether they were as craggy as Donne or as easy as Suckling . Their Restoration successors were not inferior as technicians , they were inferior simply as poets . Whether Donne was marvellously original ( as moderns believe ) or was a faulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided by argument . But it must be clear to everyone that Donne 's vital energy of creation tends to burst from the restraint of orderly expression whether in lyric or in couplet . The outstanding name in the prosody of the seventeenth century is that of Milton , and no modern affectation of depreciation can dim his shining glory . He restored verse to its greatness , and he ranks with Chaucer , Spenser and Shakespeare as one of the four chief pillars of English prosody . What really succeeds in Milton is the majesty of his utterance , whether regarded as poetry or merely as verse ; and this rebuking majesty is what some of his critics , especially among the minor poets , have found insupportable . With one important development of prosody during his time , however , Milton had little to do , though the experiments of Samson show that he may have thought of it latterly . This was the employment of the anapaest ? not in occasional substitution for the iamb , but as the principal base-foot of metre . Between the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature ; but folk-song kept it ; and in such pieces as Mary Ambree , which , perhaps , is as early as 1584 , there is no mistake about it . Dryden , however , brought his great metrical skill to the support of trisyllabic measures in various songs and in portions of his odes . Prior , too , no mean versifier , makes effective use of the anapaest . The octosyllabic couplet magnificently used by Milton was humorously used by Butler in Hudibras , which naturally inspired other satirists to make it their vehicle . Butler 's excellent versification usually receives less than its meed of praise , merely because its purpose is comic . But the chief prosodical event of the seventeenth century was the resurgence and development of the decasyllabic couplet , as a fact , together with the inculcation of " smoothness and numbers " in verse , as a doctrine . The couplet in itself was no new thing . It had been practised magnificently by Chaucer , exquisitely by Spenser , charmingly by Marlowe and efficiently by Drayton . Now , like blank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : it can be " stopped " or it can be " run on " . The most familiar example of the free or // run-on couplet is the opening of Keats 's Endymion , in which the rhymes do nor tie down the sentence-endings . The end-stopped couplet can be illustrated from any lines in Pope ? say , the conclusion of The Dunciad . Metrically the two forms are identical ; psychologically they are quite dissimilar . It is impossible to write the same kind of poem in either form . The crucial point , of course , is the rhyme . Rhyme is a natural end-stop ; if the sentence passes over the rhyme ( it is argued ) , why rhyme at all ? As late as the first foolish reviews of Keats that objection was urged . The reader who has been puzzled to know why a minor poet like Edmund Waller , coming after Spenser and Shakespeare , and contemporary with Milton , was hailed as the " reformer of our numbers " will now perhaps see a gleam of light . Blank verse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couplets , run on , and disregarding the recurrent snap of rhyme , began to wear a slovenly look . Waller , tightening and tidying up verse into neat , trim , lucid couplets , with syllables that could be numbered off , appeared to give our poetry " sweetness , numbers and smoothness " , although , actually , his later and better verse tended to " run on " , and none of it is remarkable for easy movement . It was a greater poet than Waller who used the couplet with such emphatic mastery that it dominated English verse up to the date of Wordsworth 's first published poems . Dryden exploited all its forms and possibilities in compositions of all kinds from his worst plays to his best poems . His couplet is not , like Pope 's , " bred in and in " and severely trained and exercised ; it is full-blooded , exuberant , multiform , showing , sometimes , almost the rush of the anapaest , and sometimes almost the mass of the blank verse paragraph . But you , can never mistake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verse in which Dryden exhibited his mastery was the irregular ode . More or less irregular strophes had been successfully achieved by Spenser ; and Ben Jonson ( at the other extreme ) had attempted pieces which exhibited the strictly regular correspondence in the lines of strophe and antistrophe , and the regular division of strophe , antistrophe and epode . But poets like Cowley had fastened the austerely regular name of " Pindaric " upon so-called " odes " which were without form and void . In later times the irregular ode produced some magnificent poetry , but most of those who practised it between 1650 and 1750 produced nothing but formless bombast. // X. MEMOIR AND LETTER WRITERS 1 . Evelyn and Pepys Diaries as a form of expression suited to certain natures have been common in many ages , and they have been used normally as the material for reminiscences , autobiographies and biographies . Few have been printed in full ; and of these few the greatest are the diaries of John Evelyn and Samuel Pepys , the first a personal record of events and the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the curiosities of literature that neither of these famous works came into general knowledge until the nineteenth century . The Evelyn discovery was almost accidental . William Upcott ( 1779 ? 1845 ) , the literary antiquary , employed by Lady Evelyn to inspect the manuscripts at Wotton House near Dorking , was particularly attracted by the two volumes of a diary , found , it is said , in a basket of clothes . He advised publication , and secured the help of William Bray ( 1.736 ? 1832 ) as editor . The work was published in 1818 and received by the public with great satisfaction . It has continued to be reprinted as a standard work in a large number of different forms . One diary led to the other . The volumes of Evelyn contained several references to Samuel Pepys , and these drew attention to the six mysterious manuscript volumes , written in shorthand , preserved in the Pepysian Library at Magdalene College , Cambridge . An undergraduate , John Smith , undertook to decipher them , although the celebrated stenographer W. B. Gurney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years , usually for twelve or fourteen hours a day , and completed his task . John Smith is one of the unrecognized heroes of English literature , for the first edition is always called by the name of Lord Braybrooke , the editor of the two volumes of selections published in 1815 . Evelyn and Pepys . were lifelong friends , and they had many business relations in connection with the Navy which were carried on in a spirit of mutual esteem . Both were of gentle birth , but Evelyn belonged to the class of " men of quality " , and was a frequenter of courts , while Pepys , who was very much the " poor relation " , had to make his own way in the world by his tenacity of purpose and great abilities . The two diaries differ widely both in character and extent . Evelyn 's work covers a very great part of his life ; Pepys 's , though of greater length , occupies little more than nine years of a busy career . John Evelyn ( 1620 ? 1706 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a whole-hearted Royalist , but greatly disliked the idea of Civil War . He travelled abroad and tells us just the things we // want to know . His first book , Liberty and Servitude , translated from the French , was published in 1649 , and later in that fatal year he again left England and did not return till 1652 , when the Royalist cause seemed lost and the Commonwealth firmly established . He was in regular correspondence with Charles II . In 1660 ( the year in which the diary of Pepys begins ) Evelyn became a Fellow of the newly founded Royal Society , to which Pepys was elected in 1664 . He was distressed by the smoke of London and wrote Fumifugium ( 1661 ) proposing remedies , in which ( as usual ) the government was deeply interested without actually arriving at the point of doing anything . Also in 1661 he wrote Tyrannus , or the Mode urging the use of an English dress instead of foreign fashions . Pepys and Evelyn again join hands in an odd fashion about the Navy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the song ; but if there are no trees , there can be no ships . The Navy Office referred the matter to the Royal Society , and the Royal Society referred it to Evelyn . Thus originated that noble book Sylva ( 1664 ) , which revived the spirit of planting in England . Like Pepys , Evelyn stuck to his duties during the Plague year . At the time of the Great Fire of London , he was ready with help ; and , like Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke , he prepared a plan of considerable merit for the improved building of London . To the two great diaries we owe many vivid pictures of this great calamity . Evelyn 's Life of Mrs Godolphin , the young and beautiful friend whose death was a great blow to him , is one of the little gems of English biography . The tribute of his wife to his own excellence is a moving utterance . Far different was the life of Samuel Pepys ( 1633-1703 ) . Evelyn was a public figure more fully revealed by his diary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forgotten donor of old books to his college library , was a completely unknown person . Strange paradox , that the most intimately known Englishman of the past should have lain unnoticed for over two centuries in the dust of an obscure grave in a remote City church ! After the resurrection of the man came the rediscovery of the official , and the ingenuous , childish , fretful , and frivolous lover of wine , women and song proved to have been a conscientious administrator in an age of conscienceless venality , an inspired worker for the Navy , a stout patriot , and as wise a critic of men and affairs as of plays and music . In 1658 he became clerk ( at a salary of So ) to George Downing ( who gave his name to Downing Street ) . The diary opens on 1 January 166o . Through the influence of s kinsman , Sir Edward Montagu , Earl of Sandwich , Pepys obtained a minor secretaryship and was later appointed Clerk of the rivy Seal as well as Clerk of the Acts . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He reformed the victualling id financial administration of the Navy , and , indeed , lacked nothing 1 // but high rank to make him a great figure in public life . Being merely a commoner of great administrative genius he was naturally relegated to obscurity . In January 1664 , he suffered his first great calamity . Like another inconspicuous commoner , John Milton , he developed symptoms of blindness . He was compelled to abandon his beloved reading and writing , and bade farewell to his private world irr May 1669 , when he made the last affecting entry in his diary and closed the mysterious volumes which were not to be read again till the world of Clarendon and the Cabal had changed to the world of George IV and George Stephenson 's first railway . Pepys lived for thirty-two years after the closing of the diary , irr which he never made another entry . He became Secretary to the Admiralty in 1673 , and Master of Trinity House in 1676 ; but in 1678 he was one of the victims of the Popish Plot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servant of the country . He was sent to the Tower ; but the failure of carefully manufactured evidence against him led to his release in 1680 . He had lost his office and his living . He was , however , sent to Tangier in 1683 , and wrote a diary which gives an interesting picture of the condition of the place and a vivid account of its maladministration . In 1684 he was reappointed to his Secretaryship and embarked again on a campaign of naval reform ; but at the Revolution of 1689 , the man who had spared no pains in his endeavour to place the country in a proper condition of national defence was sent by the new government to the Gatehouse in Westminster as an enemy to the State . He was released , and entered into a period of honourable retirement , during which he was considered and treated as " the Nestor of the Navy " . He had already served in the House of Commons . He wrote his Memoires ( f the Navy ( 169o ) and kept up his many activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London to what Evelyn calls his " Paradisian Clapham " . Here he lived with his old clerk and friend , William Hewer , and died in the presence of the learned George Hickes , the non-juring Dean of Worcester . The last two Stuart kings were precisely L28,007. as . 14d. in his debt , but the new government of William and Mary did not feel that they were called to discharge a debt of honour incurred in the national service . The popular " mystery " of Pepys 's diary is not very mysterious or at least it is no more mysterious than any other product of creative literary genius . For Pepys , without knowing it , was a creative arts Any person can put himself into a book , and many writers do little else than expose in print their self-pity and self-admiration . W hg the true creative artist does is to " objectify " or " externalise " his experience , so that it becomes one ( and probably the most important ) of the phenomena that interest him as artist . He neither applauds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplated // with interest the external creature called by his own name and set down his failings and his aspirations with Defoe-like veracity of detail . Pepys is the only writer of his kind known to history . There are many diarists , there is only one Pepys . For whom did Pepys write his diary ? people fondly ask . The question is best answered by another : For whom did Rembrandt paint his self-portraits ? For whom ( taking a different instance ) did Sir Thomas Browne write Religio Medici ? The creative instinct compels creation ; and a genuine artistic creation , though it has a personal origin , has a continued interest for others . But as Pepys told the truth about living people as well as about himself , he naturally wrote in a language that he believed nobody else could read . He himself is his own triumphant creation . So perfect is the picture that his very faults appeal to our affection . 2 . Other Writers of Memoirs and Letters The anonymous Memoires de la Vie du Comte de Gramont , published for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledged to be a masterpiece of French literature . Yet this book was written by an Englishman , and it deals chiefly with the English court of Charles IL . The author was Anthony Hamilton ( 1646 ? 1720 ) , grandson of the Earl of Abercorn . Some of the earlier matter may have come from Gramont himself ; but the later portion is quite different in treatment and bears definite signs of Hamilton 's own authorship . Gramont died I707 and apparently had made no attempt to claim or to publish c book . There is no need to discuss its value as history ; its value as tcrature is unquestionable , and it may be said to have created the rcvailing view of Charles II 's court . Its brief and vivid descriptions confirm the impressions left by Pepys . The Memoirs of Sir john resby ( first published 1734 ) is the work of an accomplished man ho united in himself the qualities of a courtier and those of a country squire . He tells us much about the villainies of the Popish Plot . Sir Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1712 ) and Memoirs ( 1721 ) is a first-hand authority for the long period covered by his life . Reresby and Bulstrode hover on the boundaries of literature , and occasionally cross the frontier . Let us turn to some women of the time . Though the Memoirs of Lady Fanshawe remained unpublished in full till 1829-30 , they challenge comparison with any memoirs of the age to which they belong . Ann Fanshawe 's life covers the period between 1625 and and her story is fresh and fascinating . The Letters of Rachel Lady sell ( 1683 ) , the devoted widow , as she had been the faithful wife , William Lord Russell , a noble victim of Charles II , virtually begin li the death of her husband on the scaffold in 1683 . Her chief ' s despondcnts were divines , to whom she writes with serene and 43 8 The Age of Dryden devout self-possession . Although small in bulk , the Memoirs of Queen Mary II , published in 1886 , should not be overlooked , as she is a sovereign who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unusually attractive . The diaries of Pepys and Evelyn and the Gramont memoirs are established classics . The other works here named , though less generally known , deserve to be read for their own sake as well as for their historical interest . XI . PLATONISTS AND LATITUDINARIANS The interest of Anglican literature does not cease with the Caroline divines . Bishop Burnet declares , in effect , that the Church of England was saved , during the perilous times of the seventeenth century , by a " new set of men " who appeared in Cambridge . They are commonly called " the Cambridge Platonists " , and they deserve more notice than we can here afford to give them . Benjamin Whichcote ( 1606-83 ) gained through many years of preaching the esteem of widely differing believers , including Groin . well himself . He sought to counteract the fanatic canting of the Puritan extremists , especially the " enthusiasm " of that constant bye product of English liberty , the rabid sectary convinced of a call to promulgate some eccentricity of doctrine or conduct . Anthon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abominable crime of studying books other than the Scriptures ? even the wor of " PLATO and his schollars " . Whichcote good-humouredly su gested that spiritual understanding might be advanced by the kin of reasoning that inspired the discoveries of Galileo and Harvey It is characteristic of a modest and broad-minded thinker that published nothing himself . His principal writings are to be found Select Sermons ( 1698 ) , Several Discourses ( 1701 ) , and Moral a Religious Aphorisms ( 1703 ) , containing in the enlarged edition 1753 the correspondence with Tuckney . Whichcote perhaps derived some of his " Platonic " doctrines fro the Commonplaces ( 1641 ) of John Sherman ( d. 1671 ) , who quo Plato 's rule , " Not who , but what " ? " Let us not so much consid who saith , but what is said . " The title of his book A Greek in t Temple ( 1641 ) indicates that his appeal is from the Latin church the Greek philosophers . It is possible to regard Sherman as the inspirer of the Platonist group in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Platonists is that of Henry More ( 1614-87 ) , who imbibed mystics in youth from The Faerie Qeeene . He entered Christ 's Colic Cambridge , almost as Milton left it , and there remained till his ( lea profoundly influencing numerous pupils . Unlike Whiclicote // Cudworth , More wrote and published voluminously . In his Psychozoia Platonica ( 1642 ) , reprinted ( enlarged ) in Philosophical Poems ( 1647 ) as A Platonick Song of the Soul , he confessed himself the disciple of Plato and Plotinus . This remarkable and often singularly beautiful poem , with its prose discussions , had an equally remarkable but inferior contemporary of the same order in Psyche , or Love 's Mystery ( 1648 ) by Joseph Beaumont ( 1616-99 ) , alleged to have been praised by Pope , in spite of its thirty thousand lines . Henry More wrote rapidly , producing numerous works of which only a few can be named here . In 1652 appeared An Antidote against Atheism and in 1656 Enthusiasmus Triumphatus , a searching exposure of Puritan " enthusiasm " . The Immortality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prose-matter of the Song of the Soul . In 166o came An Explanation of the Grand Mystery of Godliness , containing an attack on judicial astrology . The Mystery of Iniquity ( 1664 ) and Divine Dialogues ( 1668 ) aroused much interest by their gloomy prophetic tone . More 's keen sense of the " something afar " , which it was the duty of Christians to seek with the purity of spirit and the single-minded devotion of the great men of science , was a powerful " antidote to atheism " in the age of Hobbes . He gave to Anglican theology a mystical armour that enabled it to withstand the assaults of the Hobbesian materialists and the Puritan fanatics . Contemporary with More at Christ 's was the Master , Ralph Cudworth ( 1617-88 ) , who was as laborious as More was facile . His profound Treatise concerning Eternal and Immutable Morality remained in manuscript , and was not published till 1731 . The True Intellectual System of the Universe appeared in a faulty edition in 1678 and in a better form in 1743 . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hanoverianism had no use for the ancient and abstruse speculations of the admirable Cudworth . Almost at the time when More had passed from his Platonic poems his first treatises and Cudworth was still wrestling with his unpublished manuscripts , two remarkable disciples of theirs rose and ' nished with equal suddenness ? Nathanael Culverwel ( d. 1651 ) and John Smith ( d. 1652 ) . Culverwel 's An Elegant and Learned Discourse the Light of Nature appeared in 1652 , and Smith 's Select Discourses 166o . Smith , like More , was concerned to prove the immortality of the soul , but directed his argument mainly against classical sceptics like Lucretius , not against modern materialists like Hobbes . More is sometimes vague and even sometimes ridiculous ; Smith is neither , and his work , though not large in bulk , is a striking contribution to the mystical thought of the day . Culverwel is , in some respects , the t of the Cambridge Platonists , for he strikes out memorable sentences that are still valid as essential truth . He defines his own purpose as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unto // faith the things that are faith 's " . " Revealed truths are never against reason , they will always be above reason . " More and Cudworth do not seem to have welcomed warmly the latitudinarian views of Smith and Culverwel , tending as they did to exalt abstract truth at the expense of definite dogma . The spirit of compromise between breadth and dogma is exemplified in Joseph Glanvill ( see p. 392 ) . In the main , he was in agreement with Cudworth and More , Lux Orientalis ( 1661 ) being chiefly a defence of the theory held by the latter as to the prior existence of souls . In Sadducismus Triumphatus ( 1681 ) Glanvill defends the belief in witchcraft ; yet he admired the researches of the Royal Society , of which he was a Fellow . Other eminent divines either held , or inclined to , the latitudinarian view , strongly presented by the Platonists , that there was spiritual truth beyond the limits imposed by sectarians of any kind . While " breadth " or latitudinarianism may promote a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it did ) produce the flatness and apathy which were charged against the English Church in the next century . Dogma may lack breadth ; it does not lack direction , and it gets somewhere . XII . DIVINES OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND For a time the loyalist pulpit at the Restoration matched in extravagance of utterance some of the Puritan " enthusiasm " . It gradually lowered its tone and tamed its style , but it showed no signs of creative genius . Herbert Thorndike ( 1598-1672 ) , for example , is interesting as a complete Catholic Anglican , advocating confession , reservation , and prayers for the dead ; but his importance is not literary . John , Cosin ( 1594 ? 1672 ) was , like Thorndike , a liturgiologist , but is best known by A Collection of Private Devotions ( 1627 ) . A greater writer than any of these , Isaac Barrow ( 1630-77 ) , died at forty-seven , but left a mark of originality upon the theology of his age . He knew the Europe of his time and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we call Addisonian . His posthumous treatise On the Pope 's Supremacy was remarkable for its breadth of view . Barrow 's influence upon theology and theological prose was entirely beneficent . He can be profitably studied in Sermons preached upon several occasions ( 1678 ) . Barrow 's Exposition of the Creed , Decalogue and Sacraments did not displace the work , on different lines , of his older contemporary , Bishop John Pearson ( 1613 ? 86 ) , a notable preacher and an accurate patristic scholar . Pearson 's Exposition of the Creed ( 1659 ) remained till recent times the standard treatise on its subject . // Two eminent Scotsmen next attract our attention . Robert Leighton ( 1611-84 ) , who became Archbishop of Glasgow , is honourably distinguished as an advocate of toleration . His prose is simple and dignified , and his writing abounds in aphorisms . To Coleridge , Leighton had the true note of inspiration ? of " something more than human " . None of his work was published in his lifetime . A collection of sermons appeared in 1692 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1643-1715 ) , more famous as historian than as theologian . He was intimately conversant with ecclesiastical matters during something like half a century . Born in the land of presbytery and Calvinism , he became an episcopalian and an Anglican . But his interest lay in personal religion more than in theology . He was a glorified " man in the street " , always aware of , and intensely impressed by , what partisan laymen were saying . His Exposition of the Thirty-Nine Articles ( 1699 ) was , for more than a century , as famous as Pearson 's Exposition of the Creed . His ministration to the dissolute Rochester , who died a believer and a penitent , was one of the strongest memories of his life , and he has preserved it with real charm in Some passages in the Life and Death of the right honourable John Earl of Rochester ( 168o ) . The Pastoral Care ( 1692 ) is straightforward and sensible in manner and opinion . Had Burnet never written a word of history , he would still deserve a permanent place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edward Stillingfleet , Bishop of Worcester ( 1635-99 ) , who was the antithesis of Burnet in character . His personal attractiveness gave him wide popularity ; men called him " the beauty of holiness " . His Irenicum ( r 659 ) , which regards the system of church government as unimportant , gave him a place among " latitude men " . The most popular of all the preachers of the Revolution period was John Tillotson ( 163o-94 ) , a " latitudinarian " who rose as much through the pulpit as through politics to be Archbishop of Canterbury . A large collection of his sermons appeared in 1717 . Tillotson had the extempore manner . His style is simple and easy , and it earned high praise from Dryden . But the most striking example of the new pulpit manner was Robert South ( 1634-1716 ) . South , before all things , was original . He rejected the flowers of Taylor and outdid the simplicity of Tillotson . His Animadversion on Mr Sherlock 's Book entitled a Vindication of the Holy and ever-blessed Trinity is the liveliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Practical Discourse concerning a Future Judgment ( 1691 ) is a piece of round and sober prose ; but he will be remembered less as a voluminous author than as the theme of South 's racy criticism . Specially remarkable is the solitary and dignified figure of George Bull ( 1634- ' 110 ) , Bishop of St David 's , perhaps the one English ecclesiastic of w period who attained to European fame . Bossuet praised his // Judicia Ecclesiae Catholicae , and his sermons and his Harmonia Apostolica gained great renown . Bull , however , clung to Latin . But we must leave the successful churchmen and turn to a sacrificed band who came into existence at a crisis in the national history . When William and Mary were called to the throne there were many divines who felt that , having taken the oath of allegiance to one king , they could not take it to another , while the Lord 's anointed was still alive , though dispossessed by secular law . From their refusal of the second oath they were called " non jurors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The leader was Archbishop Sancroft ( 1617 ? 93 ) , one of the seven bishops who had withstood James II . In his day , he had wielded his pen adroitly . His Fur Praedestinatus , a delightful satire on Calvinism , was an early work ; but archbishops can not afford to be satirical in print ; and when he became a non juror , Sancroft refrained from all written works . Of greater literary importance are such engaging figures as Ken and Hickes . Thomas Ken ( 1637 ? 1711 ) is one of those religious writers whose words reveal a beautiful soul . He wrote only when he felt deeply . Ichabod ( 1663 ) tells of his disappointment with the church after the Restoration . His poetry ( including the evening hymn adapted from Sir Thomas Browne ) came readily from his pen ; his prose is still an excellent example of what educated men wrote naturally in his day . George Hickes ( 1642 ? 1715 ) was a scholar as well as a man of piety . He learnt Hebrew that he might discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " AngloSaxon and Meso-Gothic " for his own pleasure . ' His enormous Linguarum veterum septentrionalium thesaurus grammatico-criticus et archaeologicus is a marvel of erudition , and immortal as containing the first mention of Beowulf Another attractive writer among the non jurors is Robert Nelson ( 1665 ? 1715 ) , who in his Companion for the Festivals and Fasts ( 1704 ) produced one of the most popular of religious books . Nelson did for the Church of England in prose what Keble , more than a century later , did in poetry . He showed the romance of its past , the nobility of its ideal , the purity of its forms of prayer . // In a brief summary like the present a full account of our legal literature can find no place . Interested readers are therefore referred to the corresponding chapter and bibliography of the original History . The first period of English legal literature is that in which the Saxon , Anglian and Mercian kings , beginning with Ethelbert , c. 600 , began a record of the " dooms " of their folk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Canute , kings began to issue royal ordinances . The third period is that in which the Norman rulers endeavoured to discover and record what had been the " law of Edward the Confessor " , to which the English seemed attached . From the reign of Henry II we get legal writings of a new type , exemplified by Tractatus de Legibus et Consuetudinibus Regni Angliae by Ranulf de Glanvil or perhaps by Hubert Walter , and Henry de Bracton 's De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae ( c. 1256 ) . From 1292 we have an almost complete series of Year Books recording cases adjudged . The fifteenth century saw two notable additions to legal literature , Sir John Fortescue 's De Laudibus Legum Angliae and Sir Thomas Littleton 's Tenures . To the sixteenth century belongs William Lambarde 's Eirenarcha , a manual for justices of the peace . When James I came to the throne , the great unsettled constitutional question was whether the country should be governed by rex or by lex . Foremost among those on the side of rex was Francis Bacon , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coke ( 1552-1634 ) , who was the embodiment of lex and ( lie zealous political enemy of absolute monarchy . Coke produced many legal books ; but his fame , as a writer , rests fundamentally upon two , namely , his Reports and his Institutes . To him was largely due the legend of Magna Carta and many imaginary rules of law . Contemporary with these party men , however , were some devoted purely to research , rightly called the fathers of the scientific study of legal history . Foremost among them was John Selden ( 1584-1654 ) , the most erudite Englishman of his day . To a wide classical scholarship he added a remarkable knowledge of archaeology , history , philology and legal antiquities . He was endowed , moreover , with a mind free from prejudice , a well balanced judgment , a calm judicial temperament . In 1618 he wrote his treatise , Mare Clausum ( not published till 1636 ) , an attempt to vindicate England 's claim to sovereignty over the narrow seas against the attack which Grotius d made upon it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established , and in 165o a mmittee was appointed to consider the matter of legal reform . Parliament resolved that one thing , at any rate , should be done . // English should be made the language of the law . But when discussion turned from this principle to questions of substantial reform , the Puritan leaders were more " enthusiastic " than helpful . Hugh Peters wanted to take over the laws of Protestant Holland ; John Rogers wanted simply the law of Moses . Before long Cromwell settled the matter by the establishment of a military despotism and martial law . The main literary products were Matthew Hale 's London 's Liberties ( 1650 ) , Thomas Hobbes 's Elements of Law ( 1640 ) , and William Prynne 's Collection of Fundamental Liberties and Laws ( 1654-5 ) . The Restoration brought back the common law , and the old French and Latin jargon . At this period we again meet the name of Sir Matthew Hale ( 1609-76 ) , whose most notable work was his fragmentary History of the Common Law of England ( printed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early law and the institutions connected with it was made by Sir William Dugdale in his OriginesJuridicales ( 1666 ) . In 1679 a collected edition of the Year Books appeared . But the old law did not lack its critics . Prominent among these was the irreconcilable William Prynne . In 1669 he published his Animadversions on the Fourth Part of Coke 's Institutes . A much more formidable critic , however , both of Coke and of the laws of England , was Thomas Hobbes . In his Dialogue between a Philosopher and a Student of the Common Laws ( published posthumously in 1681 ) he assails the legal and political principles of Coke and the other opponents of the Stuart autocracy . As a writer on law Hobbes has not even yet been fully appreciated . It is right that the written words of these great jurists should be mentioned in a history of literature in its broad sense . Actually , however , there is but one of the company who has found his way into the intenser literature which is part of every man 's reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than to law . Table-Talk : being the Discourses of John Selden Esq . Being His Sense of various Matters of Weight and High Consequence ; relating especially to Religion and State was first published in 1689 , thirty-five years after Selden 's death , and nine years after that of his sometime amanuensis , Richard Milward . Selden 's Table-Talk , like Ben Jonson 's Conversations , is one of those annoying posthumous works which lack the formal certitude of authenticity . The strong voice of authority is almost certainly Selden 's ; but the rather confusing alphabetical sequence of the utterances may be Milward 's . " Table-Talk " is hardly the best name for a collection of autocratic deliverances , some , like Preaching , several pages long , and some , like Councils and Trinity , condensing a treatise into a few trenchant lilies . But , however titled , it is an inexhaustible little book . 445 XIV . JOHN LOCKE AND SOME ECONOMISTS John Locke ( 1632-1704 ) is the most important figure in English philosophy , though others have excelled him in genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on economics , on politics and on religion expressed the best ideas of the time . His great work , An Essay concerning Human Understanding , may have seemed only to show the grounds in the human mind for honesty , liberty and toleration ; but actually , by its " historical plain method " , it gave a new direction to European philosophy . Locke did not graduate as a bachelor of medicine at Oxford till 1674 . His medical knowledge made him acquainted with the Earl of Shaftesbury , Dryden 's Achitophel . He became a member of Shaftesbury 's household and saved the statesman 's life by a skilful operation . He directed the education of the boy who became third earl and author of Characteristics . He shared the mutations of Shaftesbury 's fortunes and , after the statesman 's flight and death , the philosopher withdrew to Holland . Here he continued his literary work , and before he returned to England in 1689 the Essay concerning Human Understanding seems to have reached its final form . Locke could have taken high place under the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enabled him to absent himself a good deal from London , which he hated . He had not published anything before his return to England in 1689 ; and by this time he was in his fifty-seventh year . In 1689 his Latin Epistola de Tolerantia was published in Holland , a corrected English translation being issued in 169o . The controversy which followed this work led to the publication of A Second Letter concerning Toleration ( 1690 ) and A Third Letter for Toleration ( 1692 ) . In 1690 the book entitled Two Treatises of Government was published , and a month later appeared the long expected Essay concerning Human Understanding , on which he had been at work intermittently since 1671 . It met with immediate success , and led to a voluminous literature of attack and reply . Its most vigorous critic was Stillingfleet . Among Locke 's correspondents and visitors were Sir Isaac Newton and Anthony Collins , a young squire , whose activities will concern us later . The extent and variety of Locke 's interests are attested by later works ? Some Considerations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Value of Money ( 1691 ) , and Further Considerations ( 1695 ) ; Some Thoughts concerning Education ( 1693 ) ; The Reasonableness of Christianity ( 1695 ) , and , later , A Vindication of the same against certain objections . Among writings which were published after his death are commentaries on the Pauline epistles , a Discourse on Miracles and , most important of all , the small // treatise on The Conduct of the Understanding , originally designed as a chapter of the Essay . Locke opened a new way for English philosophy . He undertook a systematic investigation of the human understanding with a view to determining the truth and certainty of knowledge and the grounds of belief , on all matters about which men are in the habit of making assertions . In this way he introduced a new department , or a new method , of philosophical inquiry , which has come to be known as the theory of knowledge , or epistemology ; and , in this respect , he was the precursor of Kant and anticipated what Kant called the critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a simple beginning . A discussion with friends on some unimportant matters led to no conclusion ; and Locke saw that before inquiries could be profitable , it was necessary to settle " what objects our understandings were , or were not , fitted to deal with " . Locke proposed to expound this on a single sheet of paper next day ; but the " single sheet " became the Essay , and the " next day " arrived twenty years after . Locke 's interest centres in the traditional problems . He refuses to " meddle with the physical consideration of the mind " , though he has no doubt that the understanding can be studied like anything else . All the objects of the understanding are described as ideas , and ideas are spoken of as being in the mind . The term " idea " implied no contrast with " reality " . Locke avoids any presupposition about matter , or mind , or their relation . He begins neither with mind nor with matter , but with ideas . His first inquiry is " how they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show that they constitute the whole material of our knowledge . His treatment of " the association of ideas " is an afterthought , and did not appear in the earlier editions of the Essay . It is out of place in a history of literature to expound or criticize the doctrines of a particular philosopher . We must be content to state briefly his main conclusion . The real existences to which knowledge extends are self , God , and the world of nature . Of the first we have , says Locke , an intuitive knowledge , of the second a demonstrative knowledge , of the third a sensitive knowledge . " God has set some things in broad daylight " ; but of others we have only " the twilight of probability " . With that we must be content . Locke 's practical interests find ample scope in his other works . In Two Treatises of Government he refutes Sir Robert Filmer 's doctrine of absolute power and propounds a theory which reconciles individual liberty with collective order . His economic writings are particular rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the economic arguments produced at the time by Sir Josiah Chil Sir Dudley North and , especially , Sir William Petty , who devot himself to what his most famous book indicates in its title , Politic Arithmetic ( 169o ) . Petty distrusted vague generalities and required // exact statements . Thus , he defined interest as " a reward for forbearing the use of your own money for a term of time agreed upon " ? a definition that carries us far beyond the old notion of " usury " . Locke 's plea for toleration in matters of belief has become classical . His exclusion of Papists and atheists must not be blamed as inconsistency . To Locke a Roman Catholic was not a person who professed a particular kind of religion , but a person who professed allegience to a foreign and hostile potentate ; and an atheist was a person who , in repudiating the accepted contract between man and God , repudiated the basis of social contracts . His Thoughts concerning Education and his Conduct of the Understanding must always be considered in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's quality of mind propounded a theory of education at all was a great gain : at least there was something to discuss . Locke had the gift of making philosophy speak the language of ordinary life . No one can fail to admire the lucid , dignified and unostentatious prose in which Locke conveyed his philosophy and made it universally intelligible . Of writers opposed to Locke we need only mention John Norris of Bemerton ( 1657-1711 ) , a voluminous author of discourses , letters , and poems , as well as of the longer and more systematic work on which his fame depends , An Essay towards the Theory of the Ideal or Intelligible World , the first part of which was published in 1701 , and the second in 1704 . In temper of mind , Norris may be regarded as the antithesis of Locke . He represents mysticism as against the tatter 's critical empiricism , and he has been praised by those mystically dined perhaps rather more than he deserves . XV . THE PROGRESS OF SCIENCE With the exception of anatomy and astronomy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first and greatest advance as made in anatomy , when the great Belgian Vesalius dared to turn way from Galen and search into the human body . His De corporis ani fabrica ( 1543 ) is one of the landmarks of human knowledge . ntemporary with Vesalius , though older in years , is Copernicus of land , whose De Revolutionibus , completed in 1530 and published 1543 , the year of his death , definitely reassembled for succeeding orations the machinery of the universe . Man lost the starry ores and gained the solar system . In the seventeenth century new thuds and new appliances appeared . John Napier of Merchiston de known his discovery of logarithms in 1614 and the first tables tr published in 1617 . Seven years later , the slide rule was invented Edmund Gunter . Decimals were coming into use and , at the of the sixteenth century , algebra was being written in the don we still employ . William Gilbert , physician to Queen // Elizabeth , had published his experiments on electricity and magnet 1%11 r in the last year of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telescope ; and , for the first time , Jupiter 's satellites , the mountains in the moon , and Saturn 's rings were seen by human eyes . The barometer , the thermometer and the air pump , and , later , the compound microscope , all came into being at the earlier part of our period , and by the middle of the century were in the hands of whoever cared to use them . In his Tractate on Education Milton advocates the teaching of medicine , agriculture and fortification ? the last being an exceedingly practical kind of applied mathematics . By the time of Paradise Lot the learned accepted the Copernican system , though the world at large remained Ptolemaic . We ourselves still use Ptolemaic terms ut popular speech . The evidence of the best diaries tells us much about the place of science in the life of an educated man . Lord Herbert of Cherbury , John Evelyn and Samuel Pepys are all examples of busy men whose wide range of knowledge included science . The Marquis of Worcester , popularly credited with premature discovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dabbler in mechanical crafts ; but Sir Kenelm Digby , though a great pretender , was a more serious student of science . In mathematics John Wallis of Cambridge was a forerunner of Newton and had t he wide education of his age . His Arithmetica Infinitorum contained the germs of the calculus , suggested the binomial theorem to Newton , evaluated Tr and first used the current symbol for infinity . Another mathematical ecclesiastic was Seth Ward , Bishop of Exeter and afterwards of Salisbury . Ward and Wallis refuted Hobbes 's attempted proof of the squaring of the circle . Like the distinguished mathematicians just mentioned , Isaac Newton ( 1642-1727 ) took a keen interest in certain forms of theology current in his day ; but in his intellectual powers he surpassed dicta all . He was the founder of the modern science of optics . His di*. covery of the law of gravitation , and his application of it to Kepler ' .. laws of planetary motion made him the founder of the science gravitational astronomy . His discovery of the method of fluxious entitles him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . matical analysis . His chief work , Philosophiae Naturals Principits Mathematica ( 1687 ) , has been described as the greatest triumph of the human mind . Though Newton belongs to the history of learning rather than to the history of letters , his name adorns either chronicle . His fame as a man of science was European ; but his dabbling with interpretations of Biblical prophecies must be consigned to the history of aberrations . The second man of outstanding genius in British science in the seventeenth century was William Harvey ( 1578-1657 ) . Harvey , // " the little choleric man " , was in his thirty-eighth year when , in his lectures on anatomy , he expounded his new doctrine of the circulation of the blood to the College of Physicians , although his Exercitatio Anatomica de motu cordis et sauguinis did not appear till 1628 . In the convincing demonstration of his discovery only one link of evidence was missing , and this was supplied shortly after Harvey 's death by Malpighi , whose use of the compound microscope , not available to Harvey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seventeenth century philosophers in the biological and medical sciences , they were equalled by workers on the physical side . Robert Boyle was , even as boy of eighteen , one of the leaders in the comparatively new pursuit of experimental science . His first love was chemistry . He settled at Oxford , where he arranged a laboratory and had as assistant the famous Robert Hooke . He invented something like the modern air-pump . He confirmed Harvey 's great discovery . He busied himself with the weight , with the pressure and with the elasticity of air , and with the part it played in respiration and in acoustics . He was the first to distinguish a mixture from a compound , to define an element , to prepare hydrogen . It was men such as these that re-established the Royal Society in 1660 . This great institution has not only had the longest existence among the scientific societies of the world , but anticipated its own birth in 1645 , when the Philosophical College came into being . During the Civil War this body divided itself between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetings were resumed , and in 1662 the Society received the royal charter . XVI . THE ESSAY AND THE BEGINNING OF MODERN ENGLISH PROSE he period we have been considering is noteworthy for the general mergence of a prose style very little different from the English of - day . This was not a new creation . Its main virtues , lucidity , recision and sobriety can be found in the works of Hobbes , who born in the year of the Armada . Before we pass to examples of u " new prose " we should observe a fact too frequently overlooked , timely , that writing in prose has two main purposes , which may be distiinct , or which may combine , especially when the writer is a man f genius . Prose may be used to convey facts or to convey feelings . other words , there is a prose which reports and a prose which creates . The purpose of Milton and Jeremy Taylor in their great in phonic passages of prose-music was not to instruct but to move . Such writing as theirs can convey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , minor truths . What happened in the seventeenth century was // not that there grew up a public which demanded plainer prose , but that there accumulated a mass of information which demanded plainer prose . There may be poetry in the art of healing ; there must be plain prose in a treatise on anatomy . The men of science whom we lately considered , when they did not write in clear Latin , felt they must write in clear English ; in fact , the Royal Society did definitely demand plain and unadorned English from its members , as Thomas Sprat , the first historian of the Society , precisely records . In 1664 his colleagues gave effect to their views by appointing a committee for the improvement of the English language , which included , besides himself , Waller , Dryden , and Evelyn . We have never come nearer than that to the foundation of an English Academy resembling the French . One other fact must be remembered . The seventeenth century had a much larger reading public than the sixteenth . In the sixteenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . Salmasius perished under the cannonading of Milton . In the seventeenth century men wrote for " the Town " . They did not try to annihilate , they tried to argue . The admirable John Wilkins ( 1614-72 ) , afterwards Bishop of Chester , one of the founders of the Royal Society and its first secretary , had recommended in his popular Ecclesiastes or the Gift of Preaching that the style of the pulpit should be plain and without rhetorical flourishes . Tillotson 's sermon , The Wisdom of being religious ( 1664 ) , is , in its perfect plainness and absence of rhetoric , an instructive contrast to the imaginative discourse which Jeremy Taylor delivered , only eight months earlier , at the funeral of Archbishop Bramhall. , Stillingfleet preached in plain English , and South not only preached in plain English , but mocked at those who did not . The influence of France upon England in the seventeenth centu has already been mentioned . Though the Civil War checked for time the French studies of Englishmen , it ultimately contributed their diffusion ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 1646 Hobbes , " the first of all that fled " , Waller , D'Avenan Denham , Cowley and Evelyn were gathered together in the Frenc capital . There were many others . The heroic romances were not th only examples of French literature read and translated in Englan when the Restoration came . Versions , good and bad , appeared works by Pascal , Descartes , Boileau , Bossuet , Malebranche , Ls Rochefoucauld , La Bruyere , Le Bossu and Rapin . Saint-Evremon was long in England , and one of his friends was Cowley , who ga a lighter touch to the essay . Prose became more urbane . One delightful example of personal prose can be found in the letters written by Dorothy Osborne to her future husband , Sir William Temple , between 1652 and 1654 .. Temple himself ( 1628-99 ) , once A great figure , has fallen out of notice , but he is still important . His // Letters , first collected by Swift ( 1700-3 ) , are interesting in historical matter and simple and unaffected in manner . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His essays , or , as they were called , Miscellanea , appeared in three parts ; the first in 1680 , the second in 1692 and the third in 1701 . The most widely read of these essays , Upon Ancient and Modern Learning ( 1692 ) , was inspired by a stupid literary quarrel which had raged in Paris . The essay has no importance , but it produced two notable works , Swift 's Battle of the Books and Bentley 's annihilation of the supposed letters of Phalaris . The most agreeable of the essays are Of Poetry ( with its oft-quoted sentence ) , Upon the Gardens of Epicurus or Of Gardening and Upon Health and Long Life . Temple writes like a fine gentleman at his ease , without any affectation , but with considerable negligence . Like Cowley , Temple came under the spell of Montaigne . In 1685 Montaigne was popular enough in England to warrant the publication of a new translation of his essays from the pen of Charles Cotton ( 163o-87 ) . Cotton sometimes misses his author 's meaning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes does . Cotton 's work is dedicated to George Savile , Marquis of Halifax ( 1633-95 ) , whose own Miscellanies , first collected in 1700 , carry the stamp of a most attractive character . His finest piece of writing is the praise of truth in The Character of a Trimmer ( 1688 ) ? a passage worthy of Montaigne . His admirable Character of King Charles he Second was not published till 1750 . A Letter to a Dissenter Upon the O casion of His Majesties late Gracious Declaration of Indulgence ( 1687 ) and The Anatomy of an Equivalent ( 1688 ) have both point and style.More in the nature of an essay is The Ladies New Years Gift , or Advice toa Daughter ( 1688 ) , addressed to his own daughter , mother of Lord Chesterfield , author of the celebrated Letters . It is entirely delightful . Indeed , Halifax has hardly yet received his due , either as a public figure f high integrity or as a writer of what may be called , in the best sense , " gentleman 's prose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things of their kind in English . The greatest creative force in prose was Dryden , and probably his rarest prose achievement was the Preface to the Fables . When , nine yearslater , Steele wrote the first number of The Tatler , he found both model odel and an instrument ready to his hand . CHAPTER IX FROM STEELE AND ADDISON TO POPE AND SWIFT I. DEFOE : THE NEWSPAPER AND THE NOVEL Daniel Defoe ( 1659-173T ) is known to most readers as a pioneer novelist of adventure and low life . Students know him further as a prolific pamphleteer of questionable character and many disguises . His early biographers regarded him not only as a great novelist but as a martyr to liberal principles and homely piety . Some of his own contemporaries saw in him a political traitor , a social outcast , and a venal scribbler whose effrontery was equalled only by his energy . Something of the truth can be found in all these views . The novelist we know grew out of the journalist and political hack we have almost forgotten . Defoe is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years after Bunyan , on the very eve of the Restoration . The acute manifestations of religious eccentricity , shown at their height during the Commonwealth , and all comprehensively labelled " Puritanism " , did not survive the Restoration , which reestablished the Church of England and buttressed its supremacy with many Acts of Parliament . The wilder Puritans , with their hope of some new theocracy , ceased to exist ; the next generation of religious liberals were not Puritans ; they bore no resemblance to Sir Hudibras and Ralpho ; they had no trace of the cant and snuffle of the " caterwauling crew " ; they maintained the old tradition of the Presbyterians and Independents ; and as they refused to conform to the re-established Episcopalian Church , they were Nonconformists or Dissent en . Bunyan was the last of the Puritans ; Defoe is the first typical Nonconformist or Dissenter in our literature . When Defoe established his periodical The Review in February 1704 , the English newspaper was less than fifty years old . Among Defoe 's predecessors in journalism ( see p. 398 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the best news disseminator of his day , and Roger L'Estrange , who was beaten by Muddiman as an editor of " newsbooks " , but who , as journalist , pamphleteer and man of letters , was Defoe 's true prototype . Sir Roger L'Estrange ( 1616 ? 1704 ) was a zealous royalist of good family and suffered in the great struggle . In 1659 he wrote many pamphlets and broadsides advocating the restoration of Charles II , and after that happy eve he was made one of the licensers of the press . His political newspal // The Observator , curiously cast in dialogue form , ran from 1681-7 . He supported James II and lost any hope of advancement at the Revolution . There is no need to cite his forgotten productions ; but mention should be made of his Fables of Aesop ( 1692 ) and its successor , Fables and Stories Moralized ( 1699 ) . His translations are noticed later . L'Estrange was a large figure in his age and of no magnitude in this . Between the suppression of The Observator in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers appeared . James Dunton brought out his Athenian Gazette , afterwards The Athenian Mercury ( 1690 ? 6 ) , as an organ for those curious in philosophical and recondite matters . Defoe was one of the curious . In 1695 the Licensing Act was allowed to lapse and several new journals were at once begun ? The Flying Post , a tri-weekly Whig organ , the Tory Post Bag , and The Post Man . These were primarily disseminators of news . They were supplemented , in 1702 , by the first of the dailies , The Daily Courant . In 1704 Defoe began The Review as an organ of moderation , ecclesiastical and political , and of broad commercial interests . Defoe 's journalistic originality appears in his abandonment of the dialogue form and of violent partisanship . He cultivated moderation , and sought to gain acquiescence rather than to embitter animosities . Defoe 's life and work defy summary . A few general considerations will help us to understand him . Like Dickens ( whom in some ways he resembles ) he was highly endowed with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape his notice , nothing was too large to fit into his comprehension . His curiosity was insatiable , Iid he knew how to turn the smallest detail to literary account . To rite was as natural to him as to breathe . He made fiction seem like uth and truth seem like fiction . Neither his mind nor his character n be called lofty ; yet his gifts were many and various . He was the rfect journalist . He could write on anything or nothing . If it be arged against him that he was venal and dishonest , the charge lies ore heavily against the statesmen who made crooked use of him . Defoe was born in London and sent to a dissenting school at oke Newington . Details of his early commercial career are somehat obscure , and do not concern us here . During his first phase we v call him a tradesman-publicist . We hear of a verse satire in i ; but his first real book was the Essay upon Projects ( 1697 ) , a prising display of versatility and modern ideas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would need several pages . Here must be content with a notice of some typical pieces , and we can refore pass at once to his most famous early publication , his lively se ? satire against those who jeered at the foreign birth of William It was called The True-Born Englishman ( 1701 ) and it had the clarity it deserved . As rhymed journalism it has never been // equalled . " The Author of The True-Born Englishman " , as Defer called himself , having made a true beginning , had no intention of stopping . His most important publication of I702 was the tract The Shortest Way with the Dissenters . In this Defoe assumed the character of a " high-flying Tory " and argued ironically that the shortest way of dealing with the Dissenters was to extirpate them . But the age had no taste for irony . The Whigs and Tories were waging a bitter war over the succession to the childless Queen Anne . Defoe 's pamphlet angered both parties . The Whigs , having taken it seriously , were suspicious of a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding they had been hoaxed by a Whig , were furious . Defoe was arrested , sentenced to imprisonment during the Queen ' ' s pleasure and to public exposure in the pillory . He met his fate with courage . He wrote a spirited Hymn to the Pillory and , when exposed , though not " earless " as pope has it , he was " unabash 'd " , and the mob gave him a popular triumph . The Tories had overreached themselves . Defoe was liberated at the end of 1703 , probably through the influence of Robert Harley , Earl of Oxford , half Whig , half Tory , first the friend and then the rival of the brilliant Henry St John , Viscount Bolingbroke , both of whom were important factors in Defoe 's career . Not even imprisonment or his employment as a busy agent for Harley could check the stream of Defoe 's pamphlets and poems . In 1703 and 17o5 he produced two volumes of his collected writings ? the only collection ever made by himself . Defoe 's real achievement at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of soun straightforward journalism . It first appeared in February 1704 an was suppressed in June 1713 . The Review is creditable not only to Defoe , but to Harley , his patron , who first perceived the politic importance of the press . We leave without mention many politic writings of 1704 and 1705 and come at once to a first glimpse Defoe passing from journalism to fiction ; for a year later ( 1706 appeared A True Relation of the Apparition of one Mrs Veal , the ne Day after her Death , to one Mrs Bargrave at Canterbury , the 8th September , 1705 . This , at one time thought to be a hoax written sell " Drelincourt on Death " , is actually a clever journalistic work it up of a ghost story current at the time . From the autumn of 1706 to the spring of 1710 , Defoe was work in Scotland , and did some of the underground labour that ma the Union of 1707 a practicable affair . But he was unrewarded ; f when he returned to England in penury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was allowed to transfer his services , a was sent back to Scotland . His main production of 1708-9 is t huge and methodically accurate History of the Union . In I'Jto t Whig government made the foolish mistake of impeaching Defoe 45 5 political divine named Sacheverell fora Tory sermon , and there was a sudden outburst of enthusiasm in favour of the victim . Defoe did what pamphlets can do against mob excitement , but the Whigs went out and the Tories came in . That Defoe was trying to serve two sides can hardly be doubted ; but the statesmen , especially St John , were models of duplicity . Defoe himself never wavered in his support of the Hanoverian Succession or his opposition to the Jacobites . For the second time Defoe ventured on irony , attacking the Jacobites in 1712 with his Reasons against the Succession of the House of Hanover . But the literal Whigs prosecuted him for issuing a treasonable publication , and once more he was imprisoned . The Review ceased to appear ; but he began at once to edit a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's treaty of commerce . By the end of r713 he had secured a pardon under the Great Seal for all past offences . A year later he produced the pamphlets called A General History of Trade which have led some to call him the father of Free Trade . Queen Anne died in 1714 . The Tory intriguers were routed . The Hanoverians came in and the Jacobites came out . But the Whigs triumphed and kept their hold upon English politics till George III became king nearly fifty years later . At this point begins Defoe 's most dubious period . It seems clear that between r716 and I720 he was employed as a " secret agent " , working with the Jacobite publisher Nathaniel Mist , and contributing information to the Whig , ministers . Whether his preliminary apologia , An Appeal to Honour nd Justice , tho ' it be of his worst enemies ( 1715 ) , is genuine or a clever piece of impersonation can hardly be determined ; but it has been ken quite seriously by biographers . In the same year he produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first instalments of The amily Instructor , besides numerous pamphlets . The year r717 saw e end of his career as a political controversialist . A new Defoe now appears . It was in April r719 that the first part Robinson Crusoe was published . Defoe was nearly sixty years old , t he had hitherto written nothing that would have preserved his name for posterity . During the next few years he was to become the ost extraordinarily prolific old man in the history of English nature . He had lived actively . He had read whatever fiction was rent in his time , and literary impersonation was almost a second lure in him . Mrs Veal , written in 1705 , shows his ability to make ory vivid and credible by a skilful use of circumstantial detail . He I , moreover , the true creative writer 's gift of looking at his experience objectively . Having read some account of Alexander kirk , he found no difficulty in impersonating a castaway sailor . immediate and permanent popularity of Robinson Crusoe is a monplace of literary history . Defoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced , in about four months , The Farther Adven456 Steele and Addison to Pope and Swift tures of his hero , and , a year later , Serious Reflections during the Life ' and Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe . But it is only the original that lives . True to his age and nature , Defoe wrote for edification ; but the book suddenly assumed its own life . Defoe did not write die first English novel , but he wrote the first English novel of genius . Numerous journalistic publications belong to the Robinson Crusoe year , but Defoe 's next work of importance was The History of the Life and Adventures of Mr Duncan Campbell ( 1720 ) , the deaf and dumb conjurer . Immediately after came The Memoirs of a Cavalier , an absorbing story of the wars in Germany and England . A month later appeared a fine example of the fiction of adventure , The Lib. , Adventures and Piracies of the Famous Captain Singleton . In this and in his next great book , The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to display remarkable powers of characterization . Moll Flanders is supreme as a realistic picture of low life , just as the book of the next month , Religious Courtship , is an unapproachable classic of middle class smugness and piety . To the wonderful year 1722 belong Due Preparations for the Plague and A Journal of the Plague Year , besides The Impartial History of Peter Alexowitz the Present Czar of Muscovy and The History and Remarkable Life of the truly Honourable Colonel Jacque . After the almost unmatched fertility of 1722 , the next year was barren ; but in 1724 we have our prolific and masterly writer once more , for that is the date of The Fortunate Mistress , better known as Roxana , the story in which Defoe makes his greatest advance toward the construction of a well-ordered plot . This , also , is the year of one of the best of his sociological works , his treatise on the servant question , The Great Law of Subordination Considered , as well as of die first volume of A Tour Thro ' the whole Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had written the last of his generally accepted works of fiction , A New Voyage round the World . The Political History of the Devil ( 1726 ) and The Friendly Daemon ( 1726 ) with numerous other works belonging to the same year hardlycall for notice ; but 1725+ 7 produced The Complete English Tradesman , that bourgeois classic , and 1728 saw A Plan of the English Commerce , the remarkable Auguste Triumphans , a piece of Utopian reconstruction for London , and the interesting Memoirs of an English Officer .... By Capt . George Carleton . Nothing but death could end Defoe 's enormous productiveness . His final years are a little mysterious , and his last book , The Complett English Gentleman , was not published till late in the nineteenth century . His death was hardly noticed , and his reputation sank in the aristocratic Augustan period . His labours for the Union and the Protestant Succession caused some well-meaning people in later years to discover in him the lineaments of a British Patriot and Christian Hero . But there is no need to praise Defoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing machine known to us . He wrote masses of party journalism , yet he was free from rancour . He was never brilliant ; but he employed dullness almost magically . There are no flashes of revelation in his work ; instead , there is a quiet accumulation of commonplace that gives an almost unbearable illusion of truth . As a writer and as a figure in public affairs , Defoe is second only to Swift , if even to him . No man has been injured more by the sheer quantity of his work ; no man will be injured more by attempts to claim for him impossible virtues . It should be enough that Defoe was not only the author of Robinson Crusoe , but that he had in him something of the uncalculating love of liberty which is the real mark of a tribune of the people . H. STEELE AND ADDISON Steele and Addison are writers of talent who rose almost to genius because they instinctively collaborated with the spirit of their age . Public decency was returning . Literary fops may affect the praise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization depend on character , not on impudence ? it is Newton , not Rochester , who makes the reign of Charles II glorious . After the fireworks of the Restoration and the nocturnal rowdiness of its lecherous " gentlemen " a calmer morning dawned . The steady , quiet , middle-class began to make themselves heard . Of this cleaner urbanity Addison and Steele were the voices . Richard Steele ( 1672-1729 ) led the way , and he is curiously attractive because in his own person he combined Restoration impulses and Augustan restraint . He was an Irishman and a Wier , both rake and moralist , finding in himself the sins he was lost ready to condemn . His reading sat in judgment on his conduct ; d his first publication , therefore , was The Christian Hero : an argument proving that no Principles but those of Religion are sufficient to ake a great man ( 1.701 ) . This book was long popular as a guide to nduct , but actually it was his own cry of spiritual distress . Steele turned next to the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to do good by instructing them . He governed the usual ground of Restoration drama , but he sought to paint virtue and vice in their true colours . Vice never triumphs , though virtue may suffer . In The Funeral , or Grief-d-la-mode ( 1701 ) , his first and best constructed comedy , a highly improbable plot ings virtue a delayed reward . In The Lying Lover ( 1703 ) young Bookwit suffers a number of painful experiences and ends by marrying the sweetheart whom he had courted with a fidelity rare even to on the stage . In The Tender Husband ( 1705 ) an impossible and offensive plot sacrifices dramatic probability to an unconvincing picture of conjugal fidelity . // Steele had not yet found either himself or his public . His public he presently found in the coffee-houses , where men got together , as in the later clubs , and conversed , and practised the social amenities . The coffee-house assemblies were not coteries or studio-cliques . They were parties of ordinary persons , who did not talk like books . Steele , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , thought there might be profit in a periodical appealing to the coffee-house public ; and so on 12 April 1709 appeared the first number of The Tatler . The paper came out three times a week , and each issue ( unlike The Spectator ) contained several essays , dated , according to their subjects , from different coffee-houses . Thus The Tatler , at its beginning , was hardly more than an improved imitation of Defoe 's Review or Dunton 's Athenian Mercury . Having found his public , Steele next found himself , and , as sometimes happens , he discovered himself in an impersonation . From Swift he borrowed Isaac Bickerstaff , and soon Bickerstaff , with his familiar , Pacolet , developed from Swift 's astrological humbug into a general commentator on civilized life . In this thin disguise , Steele touched on questions of breeding , good taste , courtesy and chivalry . He set forth a reasonable ideal of a gentleman and taught a new respect for women . To heighten and illustrate his discussions of family life he invented a lady editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weave the familiar incidents of the essays into the history of Jenny Distaff , he would have been well on the way towards the domestic novel . But Steele could not develop his own ideas , whether of criticism or of character . He needed a collaborator . The Tatler continued to appear three times a week until 2 January 1711 , and then ceased abruptly : we do not know why . The most probable reason is that Steele 's invention had given out and the task of going on had become laborious . The least probable , though most pleasing , explanation is that he recognized the superiority of another writer , who had contributed some essays to the paper . That other was Joseph Addison ( 1672-1719 ) , who had been at Charterhouse with Steele . Addison 's political career does not concern us ; but it may be mentioned that he held many important public offices and became a privy councillor . The least satisfactory part of his political career is that which brought him , at last , into a pamphlet-quarrel with his old friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not with their conflicts . Steele was impulsive , communicative , adventurous ; Addison was reserved , taciturn , careful . He had produced the expected Latin poems and dissertations , and the chief fruits of his four years ' travel after leaving Oxford were his Dialogues upon the Usefulness of Ancient Medas ( posthumously published in 1721 ) and his Remarks upon Several Parts of Italy ( 1705 ) . His first contribution to what may be called public // literature was The Campaign , A Poem , to His Grace the Duke of Marlborough ( 1705 ) , containing the celebrated lines about the whirlwind and the storm , and , more important to the author , containing sentiments about British freedom and valour which were pleasing to the Whig politicians . Addison began to prosper , and to be pointed out in the coffee-houses . He became urbane as well as academic and official , and instead of using ancient literature to illustrate medals , he discovered how to make it illustrate the weaknesses and peculiarities of his contemporaries . The Tatler gave him his opportunity . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steele , he found the perfect style for " occasional literature " ? lucid , colloquial , full of individuality and yet chastened by classic examples in the choice of words . Steele discontinued The Tatler in January 1711 . In P710 the Whig ministry had fallen . Addison felt a financial as well as a literary call to continue his essay writing ; and so , on r March 1711 , The Spectator was born . The Spectator was not The Tatler revived . The old paper was a medley ; its successor was a series of literary pamphlets , each confined to a single theme , grave or gay . It appeared daily and so grew into le life of its readers like a trusted friend . " Isaac Bickerstaff , " the trologer , perished with The Tatler ; the new author was " Mr Spector " , who not only gave his name to the paper but typified the irit in which it was written . Naturally he had to be a member of a ub . Steele invented the Spectator 's club as he had invented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical members : Roger de Coverly , once a town-gallant , and now a countrygentleman ; Captain Sentry , a retired soldier of quiet tastes ; a lawyer anonymous ) who resides at the Inner Temple ; Will Honeycomb , a fop and wit ; a gentle clergyman ; and Sir Andrew Freeport , a merchant , specially notable , for he marks the first appearance of the burgcois as a serious figure in modern English literature . The moneyed gull of Jacobean and Restoration comedy had gone . The sidle-class had become the hero of the new literature . The last tuber ( 555 ) of The Spectator appeared on the 6 December 1712. patently Addison and Steele felt that they had exhausted that vein writing . Addison now began to work again on his tragedy , Cato , which was produced in I713 at a time of great political excitement . success it had then it can never have again . To say it is dead is too h , for it was never alive . Addison 's prose comedy The Drummer ; the Haunted House was produced at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 713 Steele returned to literature and started several periodicals , Bich The Guardian is the most important . To this Addison contributed fifty-one papers . In 1722 came Steele 's last complete y , The Conscious Lovers , remarkable because it resumes in // brief all Steele 's best ideas on life and character . Steele and Addison produced other work separately . But when they ceased to collaborate in The Spectator , which was revived for a few months in 1714 by one of their circle , they became authors of secondary importance . Their work was done . They were complementary writers . Steele was more original , Addison was more effective . The modern essay is still Addisonian , and modern prose , in all its adventures , has never strayed far , without danger , from the model of ease and correctness set by Mr Spectator . Together , Steele and Addison succeeded because they were the voice of a new and civilized urban life . III . POPE The work of Pope has always been a battlefield of criticism . Every reputable judge agrees that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country of the restraint considered classical . What is urged against him is that he left the free air of heaven for the atmosphere of the coffee-house , and that he mechanized verse to suit an age of prose . Actually , Pope represents a reaction against artificiality and a return to nature . He descends directly from Waller and Dryden ; he revolts directly from Donne . He could not breathe in the heavy air of the metaphysical poets ; and so the paradox of Pope is that he is the chief figure in a romantic revolt . Let us abandon , he says in effect , the perverse , obscure , tormenting of words and emotions ; let us go back to health and Horace . Alexander Pope ( 1688 ? 1744 ) began life with several disadvantages . He was the child of elderly parents , he was physically weak and deformed , and he was a Roman Catholic . His feeble health denied him a school , his faith denied him a university ; and so the most instinctively classical of our poets missed the intensely classical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He grew up in an indulgent home on the verge of Windsor Forest , and his intellectual isolation gave him intellectual freedom . While still a child , he " lisped in numbers " . He read and wrote incessantly , and , as he grew , cultivated the acquaintance of older men to whom he submitted his juvenile efforts for criticism and correction . We must face at once the fact that he was completely disingenuous . Poems alleged to have been written at an early age were in fact carefully overseen an . revised . Thus his Pastorals went from hand to hand before their publication in 1709 . That they are bookish is not surprising , for the writer was young , and the pastoral was at this date a literary exercise ; but his mastery of metre is at once evident . Windsor Forest ( 1713 ) belongs to the period of the Pastorals , though it attempts to apply observation and reading to a larger theme . Less fortunate is the // Virgilian eclogue Messiah ( 1712 ) , which fails to make the Biblical prose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The real Pope is first encountered in An Essay on Criticism published n , 1711 . A poet so careful of form was likely to discuss the principles of his art , and Pope naturally turned for inspiration to the Ars Poetica of Horace and the writings of those who had imitated it . Though most of the statements are commonplaces , they have taken permanent form through the writer 's genius for poetic aphorism . With the I : say on Criticism Pope became famous . His next work established him . Based on an actual incident , The Rape of the Lock ( 1712 ) became at his hands a blend of the mock-heroic , the satirical and the fanciful , unmatched in our poetry . It is what Hazlitt called it , an exquisite specimen of filigree work . An enlarged edition appeared in 1714 . Two poems , of uncertain date , appear in his collected works of 1717 Eloisa to Abelard and the Elegy to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady . In these Pope made a sustained attempt to present pathos and passion ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotions of friendship and affection are expressed with singular charm in three Epistles , ( 1 ) To MrJervas with Dryden 's Translation of Fresnoy 's Art of aiming , ( 2 ) To a Young Lady with the Works of Voiture , ( 3 ) To the ante on her leaving the town after the Coronation . The last two Epistles ere written , in the first instance , for his friend Teresa Blount , and transferred afterwards to her younger sister Martha . Pope was ways susceptible to female influence . His friendship with Lady Mary Wortley Montagu turned to violent antagonism , owing , it is said , her laughter at a declaration of love from him ; but his affection r Martha Blount endured for thirty years and helped him through c long disease of his life . Pope 's literary activity in the first period of his career was both tense and varied . Drama he left alone , though he contributed to y and Arbuthnot 's Three Hours after Marriage . His Ode for Music Saint Cecilia 's Day discloses no gift for song . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but the aphoristic quality is highly eloped . He was not prosaic . He was satisfied with nothing less 11 poetic perfection . The " stopped " or self-contained couplet , wit was his unit of form , was no impediment to consecution of tight or statement . Pope 's couplets cohere as readily as Macaulay 's t t sentences . What may be called the Pope formula may be stated s : the lines are strictly iambic ? there are no tri-syllabic feet and y few inversions ; the rhymes fall preferably on monosyllabic ids , which thus receive the full terminal stress ; one of the rhyming rds is , where possible , a verb , so that there is a sense-ending as well a sound-ending . Within that narrow form Pope achieved as h variety as other poets have achieved within the narrow form // of the sonnet . The narrowness of eighteenth century writers like Pope amounted , in Pater 's phrase , to a positive gift . By the date of his Works of 1717 , Pope had already published the first instalment of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pope 's Homer , like Dryden 's Virgil , was not intended to make known an unknown author . His readers were familiar with Homer in Greek ; what they wanted was to hear Homer speak in the accents of their time . The first four volumes appeared in 1715 , 1716 , 1717 , 1718 , and the last two in 1720 . The harvest-home was sung by Gay in Mr Pope 's Welcome from Greece . Tickell 's version of the first Iliad was published on the same day as Pope 's first volume . It was alleged to be inspired by Addison , and Pope 's suspicious nature was ready to believe the worst . With all its faults the translation of Pope is a great success . As Bentley admitted , it is not Homer , but it is a poem , which few translations are . The reader who can not find beauty in Pope is not likely to find much in Homer . Shortly after the long labour of the Iliad was over , Pope was engaged in two fresh enterprises . The translation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to whom half the books were allotted , Fenton taking I , IV , XIX and XX , and his colleague II , VI , VIII , XI , XII , XVI , XVIII and XXIII , while Pope translated the rest and assumed , in addition , the task of revision . The first three volumes were published in 1725 , and the remaining two in the next year . But the homely , domestic , romantic Odyssey is less successful than the heroic , oratorical Iliad . The other task , which he undertook at the invitation of Jacob Tonson the bookseller , was a new edition of Shakespeare , published in 1725 . Pope 's literary and personal disqualifications for such a work were great , and the mistakes he made were carefully pointed out by Lewis Theobald , who therefore unjustly gained the bad eminence of being the first hero of The Dunciad . Among the shorter pieces of this period is the Epistle to Robert Earl of Oxford , almost unsurpassed for variety of music and dignity of style . Thanks to Homer , Pope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injuries , real or imaginary , and employ to the full his " proper power to hurt " . Pope , Swift , Gay , Parnell and others had been in the habit of meeting at Arbuthnot 's rooms in St James 's Palace . From this informal club came later the idea of satire on various forms of pedantry , in the person of an imaginary Martinus Scriblerus . In 1727 appeared the first two volumes of Miscellanies by the Club , with a preface signed jointly by Swift and Pope . Miscellanies , the last volume ( 1728 ) contained the severe character of Addison which had already made a first appearance ; but the piece that created most stir was Pope 's Martinus Scriblerus peri Bathous : or the Art of Sinking in Poetry , a prose essay in which the " Bathos or Profund " is discussed and illustrated by devastating quotations from Pope 's detested con- // temporaries , Ambrose Philips , Theobald and Dennis . The Dunciad had no immediate connection with Martinus Scriblerus . The real origin of The Dunciad was Theobald 's Shakespeare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that acute critic had struck home . The Dunciad ( Books I ? III ) appeared anonymously in 1728 . Its success was immediate . Pope was emboldened to bring out a more elaborate form in 1729 ; but the authorship was not openly acknowledged till 1735 . The main idea of The Dunciad was taken from Mac Flecknoe , and in emulating his master 's great satire , Pope must have felt that he was put upon his mettle . But Pope , unlike Dryden , was fundamentally wrong . It was not Theobald 's failure as a dramatist that moved him , but Theobald 's unquestionable success as a critic . Pope 's poetical energy during the next few years was deeply influenced by Bolingbroke , who attracted his admiration and who drew his attention to philosophical or ethical questions as matter for verse . The first result was the Epistle to the Earl of Burlington , Of Taste ( 1731 ) , afterwards altered to OF False Taste , and ultimately called Of the Use of Riches . It is a finished specimen of Pope 's art and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also entitled Of the Use of Riches ( 1732 ) . The Epistle called Of the Knowledge and Characters of Men came out in the next year . The Epistle entitled Of the Characters of Women was kept back till 1735 . During this period Pope had been busy with his Essay on Man , Epistle I of which appeared in February 1733 , II and III following in the course of the year . These were anonymous , as he was diffident of their reception . The fourth appeared under his name in January 1734 . Pope was incapable of producing a sustained philosophical poem of any value , but we must not overlook the exquisite workmanship of separate assages or the interest of the whole as an attractive , if shallow , pression of contemporary thought . The year 1733 marks the beginning of a singularly successful form f l'ope 's literary activity . Bolingbroke suggested an imitation of the first Satire of Horace 's second book , and the result was one of Pope 's realest successes . Lord Hervey and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu , both contemptuously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot ( 1735 ) . This magnificent outburst of autobiography , self-laudation , satire and invective contains Inc of Pope 's most finished and brilliant work . Two of its celeated full-length attacks are those on Lord Hervey and Addison . tiler versions of certain Satires and Epistles of Horace appeared between 1734 and 1737 . They have been called perfect translations , the persons and things being transferred as well as the words " . The its was closed by the ponderously entitled One Thousand Seven Hundred and Thirty-eight ; a Dialogue something like Horace , a second dialogue following later in the same year . The Imitations of Epistle I , // vii and the latter part of Satire II , v in octosyllabic verse ( 1738 ) are of a totally different character , being attempts to copy Swift 's manner . The Satires ( II and IV ) of Dr Donne Versified were included in the Works , Vol. if , 1735 . It may be remarked that the one year , 1738 , saw the publication of the Horatian Dialogues of the elderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson . Pope himself made no complete collection of his works , and his text is almost as difficult to establish as that of Shakespeare . His first editor , the admiring Bishop Warburton , took various liberties , and collected the poems named in this paragraph as Satires , using the Epistle to Arbuthnot as Prologue and the Dialogues of 1738 as Epilogue . Not till 1939 , when the first instalment of a new edition appeared , was a worthy effort made to produce a sound text . The New Dunciad appeared in 1742 . While gratifying many personal grudges , as in the notorious and disgraceful lines on the aged Bentley , the satire was , to a large extent , general . Pope had descried a new hero . The amiable and harmless Colley Libber had not hesitated to make fun of Three Hours after Marriage , the play to which Pope had contributed . In a new edition of the whole poem , incorporating this fourth book , Pope therefore dethroned Theobald and elevated Colley Libber to die vacant seat . Though some hold that Pope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they will scarcely deny that the conclusion of the fourth book is one of the high lights of his verse . To one rather dubious part of Pope 's work small attention need be paid . He had been a prolific correspondent , and in 1726 " the unspeakable Curll " , the publisher , put out a volume containing some of Pope 's letters . Pope was annoyed , and began to beg various friends to return his letters . A mysterious collection was issued in 1735 by Curll , who , it is alleged , had been supplied with the material by agents of Pope himself . A pretext was found for prosecuting Curl , and in 1737 Pope published an edition of his own , in which the originals were carefully manipulated to present the writer in the most favourable light . Nothing has damaged his reputation more ; and the tragi-comedy of the situation is that , original or sophisticated , Pope 's letters are unimportant . Pope has been denied the name of poet and has been made to suffer for the faults of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholars , he has been liked in every age , and his admirers now tend to increase rather than to diminish . Even his character has been as hotly denounced as defended . In spite of the Windsor home and the retreat at Twickenham , Pope 's spiritual home was the parish of St James . He was essentially urban ; and the romantic period , which sought the beauty which has strangeness in it , would have none of him , even though Byron was his last great champion . Readers must // never let themselves be bullied into a narrow view of poetry . In literature there is a voice of the city and the senate as well as of the mountains and the waters . Poetic truth may be spoken in a polished manner , as well as in a rustic manner or a prophetic manner . If to have written the most polished verse we know , to have charged words with a vivid and exciting energy , to have penned couplets or lines that remain perpetually memorable , to have presented a view , however narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done these things is to be a poet , then only the utmost hardihood of folly or perversion can deny that name to Pope . On the other hand , we shall be untrue to the soul of great literature if we refuse to admit that there are higher reaches of poetry to which Pope had no access . Think of his subjects . Pater spoke of his " exquisite insipidity " . Lytton Strachey , as a last word of eulogy , says that he " turned his screams into poetry , with the enchantment of the heroic couplet " . That is not praise , it is condemnation . The best poetry is not made out of screams , however carefully ejaculated . We have but to turn to the lyrics of Blake to find a world of poetry from which Pope was everlastingly shut out ; and it is a better world than the one he chose to inhabit . Perhaps the nineteenth century was not so wrong about Pope as we , in our pride of date , suppose . Let us be sure that we give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do not give him more than his due . IV . SWIFT Jonathan Swift ( 1667-1745 ) was the reputed son of a Jonathan Swift who had followed a more prosperous older brother , Godwin , from Yorkshire to Ireland . Jonathan 's career was brief . He obtained a call legal post in Dublin and died . Several months later , a son , onathan , was born . There is much probability that his real father as Sir John Temple , Master of the Rolls in Ireland , and father f Sir William Temple , who was therefore Swift 's older halfrother . A nurse took the child to Whitehaven and kept him there me years ; and , not long after his return to Dublin , the mother turned to her relatives in England , leaving the boy in his uncle 's are . Thus , in a curious sense , Jonathan Swift was both fatherless and motherless ; and we need feel no surprise at the growth of strange Fends about his birth . Swift was sent to Kilkenny School , where he et Congreve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Trinity College , Dublin . When he accused his uncle of giving him c " education of a dog " , he really meant that Oxford or Cambridge ) uld have been more to his heart 's desire than an Irish university . wift , born in Ireland almost by accident , and afterwards identified with Ireland against his hopes and wishes , had no tenderness for the lid of his birth . // In 1688 Godwin , who had lost his fortune , died , and Swift was left without resources . He joined his mother at Leicester , and sought for other connections . The most obvious was the celebrated Sir William Temple , then living in retirement at Moor Park in Surrey , about forty miles from London . Temple 's father had been a friend of Godwin Swift ; Temple himself had known the Swifts in Ireland ; and Lady Temple ( Dorothy Osborne ) was said to be a connection of Swift 's mother . Swift therefore entered the service of Temple , and became a kind of secretary . The arrangement was not happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patronized the proud and sensitive young man . That Temple meant to be friendly is certain ; it is also certain that he never apprehended the real measure of Swift 's capacity and that his efforts to find for him a place in the world of affairs were not very energetic . Nevertheless , life at Moor Park was of immense value to Swift . He grew familiar with public affairs and with the rich experiences of his patron , and he formed the lasting affection of his life . Dependant found sympathy with dependant . The companion of Temple 's sister , Lady Giffard , was a widow , Mrs Johnson ; and Mrs Johnson had two daughters , one of whom , Esther , was eight years old , and a great favourite with the family , when Swift was charged , among other duties , with her tuition . She was probably Temple 's daughter and therefore Swift 's own niece . Swift made one effort to escape from servitude . In 1694 , disappointed that Temple had found no place for him , he took the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Temple obtained for him the prebend of Kilroot , and the fated connection with Ireland was resumed . In 1696 he left Ireland and returned to Moor Park , where he remained till Temple 's death in 1699 . During one of the foolish periodical controversies about the merits of ancient and of modern literature , Temple felt called upon to defend the classics , but unfortunately cited the spurious " Epistles of Phalaris " as an example of ancient excellence . He was answered by William Wotton , and , in 1697 , Swift wrote his contribution to the controversy , The Battle of the Books , which , however , was not published till 1704 . The death of Temple left him without a place . He was given the living of Laracor , and found himself once more in Ireland , and alone . It was therefore arranged that Esther Johnson should live in Dublin , with a Mrs Dingley , mysteriously related to the Temples , as chaperon . Swift was thirty-four , and Esther , henceforth his " Stella " , was an attractive girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swift and Stella never met except in the presence of a third person . But Swift was soon back in England , and on familiar terms with wits and ministers . His pamphlets of 1708 ? 9 on ecclesiastical questions show his conviction that the Whigs were unfriendly to the Church ; and when the // Whigs triumphed in 1703 , he knew his hopes of preferment were vain , and retreated to Ireland . The prosecution of Sacheverell brought the Tories back in 1.710 . Swift returned to London , and the events of the three following years , with all his thoughts and hopes , are set out before us in his letters to Esther Johnson and Mrs Dingley afterwards to be known as the Journal to Stella . The efforts of the Tories were now devoted to bringing the war with France to an end . Swift composed , in November and December 1711 , two formidable pamphlets in favour of peace . By this time he had attained a position of great importance , and the authority he possessed and the respect he received gave him much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , by doubts about his orthodoxy , Queen Anne being immovably hostile . At last , in 1713 , he was made Dean of St Patrick 's , a promotion fatal to his ambitions , for it banished him once more to Ireland . His health was bad , and his reception in Dublin was anything but friendly . In October he returned to London . But the aspect of affairs threatened disaster . The Queen was dying . The succession was unsettled . Harley and St John had quarrelled , and there was some Jacobite plotting . Swift was in a difficulty ; but the death of the Queen in 1714 settled the matter . With the triumph of the Whigs and the defeat of his friends , all Swift 's hopes finally disappeared and he returned to his vast and empty deanery in Dublin . Here he found trouble of another kind . His long , peaceful association with Stella was disturbed by a strange complication . On his visits to London he became intimate with Hester Vanhomrigh , supposed to be twenty , but probably older . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little to Hester . In their friendly intercourse she was " Vanessa " and he " Cadenus " , an anagram of tetanus , i.e. " dean " ; and to her he wrote ( c. 1713 ) a poem Cadenus and Vanessa , not meant for publication , indicating that his feelings ere friendly and abstract . But abstract friendship had no meaning r Vanessa . She was passionately in love ; and , on the death of her - other , she and her sister retired to Ireland , a step very embarrassing Swift . About 1723 a crisis occurred . The usual story ( for which ere is no authority ) is that Vanessa provoked Swift 's wrath by demanding to know what were the relations between him and Stella . What is certain is that Vanessa died in 1723 and made no mention of Swift in her will , which names many other friends . The lain truth of the matter is that we know almost nothing about the relations between Swift and the two women who figure in his e , and should distrust the interpretations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturers of books for the unlacing libraries . Not the least ironical fact in the extraordinary life of Swift is that in the end he became an Irish patriot , and attained national popularity . But life was clouded for him by his own // increasing infirmities and by Stella 's illness . She died in January 1728 , after making a will which describes her as " spinster " . For Swift life soon became an acute torture , and in a sense he was dead before he died . A tumour on the brain maddened him with deafness , blindness and giddiness . In 1742 he fell into a condition of dementia . Three years later he was dead . Dublin was hushed into silence at the passing of the strangest character that ever emerged from that remarkable city . It may be added , as a last satiric touch , that not till times quite recent has any serious attempt been made to produce full , true and accurate editions of his writings . The earliest and the most characteristic of Swift 's books is A Tale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , composed about 1696 and published in 1704 . Like all his books it is anonymous . In form it is a pungent allegorical satire upon the contending religious parties of the day ; but the essayistic digressions are an important part of it . Few more entirely characteristic first books have ever been written . It contains almost every quality Swift possessed ? his intellectual power , his polished irony , his savage mockery , his terrifying humour and his immense vitality . Some of the chapters or essays are unequalled as examples of plain prose . The nearest parallel to the prose of Swift is the verse of Pope . With this short work was printed another . The origin of Swift 's Full and True Account of the Bartel Fought last Friday between the Ancient and the Modern Bookc in St James 's Library , generally known as The Battle of the Books , has already been mentioned . The fact that Swift was backing his patron in a lost cause does not lessen the interest of the book , for Swift cared little about the matter as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an excellent piece of satirical humour . Swift 's most famous and most popular book belongs to the years of his maturity and disillusionment . Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World , by Lemuel Gulliver , first a Surgeon , and then a Captain of Several Ships , was published anonymously at the end of October 1726 . It took the town by storm . Three famous controversialists , all born in the same century , have furnished the juvenile libraries of the western world with three perpetual volumes , The Pilgrim 's Progress , Gulliver 's Travels and Robinson Crusoe . The success of Swift in scoring a hit on the wrong target is almost ludicrous . Young readers are usually content with the voyages to Lilliput and to Brobdingnag , duly modified . The latter and more terrible parts of the book , which they wisely let alone , might have been conceived by the tottering mind of a thinker in the modem war-broken world . Any discussion of the possible or even probable " sources " of Gulliver 's Travels is totally vain . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come but what it is . Everything that makes Gulliver immortal has its source in Swift , and in Swift alone . // In 1708 Swift began a brilliant series of pamphlets on Church questions . The first piece ? a masterpiece of irony ? was An Argument against abolishing Christianity , in which he banters very wittily writers who had attacked religion . Another pamphlet , The Sentiments of a Church of England Man with respect to Religion and Government , was written in a more serious strain . A third , A Project for the Advancement of Religion and the Reformation of Manners ( 1709 ) , highly praised by Steele in The Tatler , is curious as a proposal for " auto-suggestion " in religion . Other tracts , able as they are , belong to the history of controversy rather than to the history of literature . A Letter to a Young Gentleman , lately entered into Holy Orders ( 1721 ) is specially attractive for its revelation of Swift 's interest in the study of the English language . The finest and most successful of Swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the late Ministry in beginning and carrying on the present war ( 1711 ) , a masterpiece of argument written in the perfection of plain prose . Some Remarks on the Barrier Treaty ( 1712 ) is a supplement to it . Swift 's other political pamphlets , too numerous to name , show the same kind of power ; but their matter has now an interest that is mainly historical . The pamphlets relating to Ireland form a very important part of Swift 's works . His indignation at the ill-treatment of the country in which he was compelled to live grew from year to year . The series began with A Proposal for the Universal Use of Irish Manufacture , in Cloaths , etc. ( 1720 ) , advocating a scheme for boycotting English fabrics . It was followed by the tracts in which he attacked the grant of a patent to an English merchant , William Wood , to supply Ireland with coinage of the lower denominations . In 1724 appeared tile first of the pamphlets known collectively as The Drapicr 's Letters . I was called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Common People of Ireland concerning the Brass Half-pence coined by It It Woods , and purported to be by " M. B. Drapier " . It was written in the simplest language , and could be understood by all . In A Letter to Mr Harding the printer , he urged that the people should refuse to ice the coins . The third letter , Some Observations ... relating to ' Wood 's Half-pence , intensified the controversy ; and the Letter to the hole People of Ireland , declaring that the Irish should be as free as their brothers in England , practically ended the scheme , though other ublications followed . Wood 's patent was cancelled , and he received pension instead . The " Drapier " triumphed ; and Ireland lost its needed small change . In A Short View of the State of Ireland ( 1728 ) wilt gives a touching account of the condition of the country . The rirs of pamphlets reached its climax in A Modest Proposal for eventing the Children of Poor People from being a Burthen to their rats , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 729 ) , in which , with searching irony and bitterness , Swift suggested // that the poverty of the people should be relieved by the sale of their children as food for the rich . The pamphlet is both a terrible indictment of Irish helplessness and a terrible parody of political argument . On literary subjects , Swift wrote little . In 1712 , he published his Proposal for correcting , improving and ascertaining the English Tongue , in the form of a letter to Harley . In this tract , to which he allowed his name to be affixed , he urged the formation of an academy , which was to fix a standard for the language . Nine years later , Swift published in Dublin an amusing satire , A Letter of Advice to a young Poet : together with a Proposal for the Encouragement of Poetry in this Kingdom ( 1721 ) . In the rather patronising Letter to a Very Young Lady on her Marriage ( 1727 ) , Swift advises his friend to listen to the talk of men of learning , as few gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or even be brought to spell correctly . Swift 's poetry has the merits of his prose , but not many other merits . To trace and identify all his writings in verse is a heroic task . He began by writing frigid " Pindaric " odes , after the fashion of Cowley . But Dryden 's good-humoured criticism turned him to lighter verse , modelled on Butler in style , and generally satirical in matter . One of the earliest and best of his playful pieces is the graceful Baucis and Philemon . The famous Cadenus and Vanessa ( 1726 ) gives , in a mock classical setting , Swift 's account of his acquaintance with Hester Vanhomrigh . Much more pleasing are the pieces which Swift wrote year by year on Stella 's birthday . He is here at his best in verse . At the other extreme are his satires on women , which are some of the most horrible verses ever written . Savagery has full play in his political ballads and skits . On Poetry : a Rapsody ( 1733 ) was thought by Swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his most frequently quoted lines . The poem On the Death of Dr Swift ( 1731 ) , with its mixture of humour , egotism and pathos , is a moving piece , the last lines being strangely applicable to his actual end . Of Swift 's correspondence , by far the most interesting is that with Esther Johnson , afterwards known as the Journal to Stella . His style , always simple and straightforward , is here at its best . Both in this and in his general correspondence , the ease and vivacity of the writing can hardly be matched in epistolary literature . Much has been written in defence of Swift since the unsympathetic studies of Macaulay , Jeffrey and Thackeray appeared , but he still remains a mystery . It is not easy to reconcile his contempt for mankind with his affection for his friends and their affection for him ; or his bitterness against women with the love he inspired . It is , again , difficult , in view of the decorum of his own life , and his real , if formal , religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The normal physiological circumstances of life seem to have filled him with inexplicable horror . The early years of poverty and dependence // left an indelible mark on him , and he became a proud , embittered man . Had he been born to rank and wealth he would have taken a leading , perhaps a decisive place in the tangled politics of the time . Swift wrote the perfection of plain prose , with easy rhythm and exquisite cadence . He has no idiosyncrasy , yet the sheer force of personality is overwhelming . Earnestness , satire , cynicism , invective , all proceed with the same decorum of outward gravity . Swift wrote many small works , the effect of which is cumulative . In a brief sketch like the present , which can not discuss or even name the greater part of them , he must inevitably appear with his magnitude lessened . But a reading of the works recorded in the preceding paragraphs will show that in intellectual energy and penetrating force of style he was the greatest writer of his age . To love Swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him without admiration and without pity . V. ARBUTHNOT AND LESSER PROSE WRITERS The name of Dr John Arbuthnot ( 1:667 ? 1735 ) is familiar to all readers of Pope , Swift and their associates ; but his actual writings are known to few , mainly because he took no pains to preserve his work or to separate his contributions from various joint enterprises . He was born in Scotland , and , after settling in London to practise medicine , became the Queen 's physician in 1709 . He defended the Union between England and Scotland in a pamphlet , A Sermon ... onthe subject of the Union ( 1706 ) and was soon in close touch with the anti-Marlborough party at Court . In September P710 Swift came to London from Ireland , and undertook the management of the Tory perioclical , The Examiner ; and the acquaintance between the Irish and the Scottish wits soon ripened into affectionate intimacy . Arbuthnot was responsible for a series of pamphlets published in 1712u , to create a feeling in favour of ending the war with France . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of Lord Strutt , John Bull , Nicholas Frog , and Lewis Baboon , who spent all they had in a Latv Suit . Other " John Bull " pamphlets followed in quick succession and they were all rearranged later and published in 1727 as The History of John Bull . These pamphlets carried on , in their ownway , the work done by Swift in The Conduct of the Allies and The Examiner . Later in I712 Arbuthnot published an amusing pamplet entitled The Art of Political Lying . He was one of the club Tory statesmen and writers who called each other " Brother " and had weekly meetings . Soon we hear of the Scriblerus Club , and of a proposal to publish the Memoirs of Scriblerts . The Memoirs were not published until 1741 , but the influence of the Club can be felt in other pieces , such as The Dunciad and Gulliver . The death of the Queen put // piece in couplets , which is not now likely to be read . Of satires in verse no complete examples are to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Fleetwood Shephard , Esq . are in that vein ; but Prior was fertile in a wide variety of light satirical narrative in verse , from the familiar fabliau to the humorous ballad or character-sketch and epigrammatic sallies of all sorts . The best instances of Prior 's success in the fabliau are An English Padlock and Hans Carvel . In Down-Hall , a Ballad , he achieves a humorous character-sketch of the landlady of the Bull at Hendon ; but the best example of his playful insight into character is the poem recently recovered , and named Jinny the Just . His poems to children are among the best of their kind , and his various " Cloe " songs , though not of the highest excellence , have a delightful kind of prettiness . Prior 's shorter poems mark him as the earliest and most successful among masters of English familiar verse . He wrote well in many forms . His imitation of Spenser is poor , but it was at least attempted . His imitation of Chaucer failed simply because ( like Dryden ) he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as evidence that there was still a hunger for poetry in a form more free than the Wallerian couplet . Prior succeeded best with the octosyllabic couplet and various forms of the anapaestic line , the latter of which he uses very skilfully . As a prose writer he shows considerable skill , but the existing pieces are unimportant and need not be discussed . Never great , Prior is always good , and engages the affection of those who unbend to his easy charm . The spoiled child of the Queen Anne fraternity of poets was the pliant fabulist John Gay ( 1685-1732 ) . His first experiment was a blank verse piece called Wine ( 1708 ) , an imitation of John Philips 's Cyder . The Fan in three books ( 1713 ) imitates the Pope of The Rape . More important is The Shepherd 's Week ( 1714 ) in six cantos , written in successful ridicule of the urban pastorals of " Namby-Pamby Philips " , for Gay was a born parodist . At the end of 1715 he composed what is probably his best remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Streets of London , in three books , imitated from Swift . The idea is good , the versification neat , and the mock heroic style admirable . In 1727 he brought out his Fables ( a second part followed posthumously in 1738 ) and won with them a poetical success that kept his name alive for a century and more . They arc ambling , slipshod , and far indeed from the perfection of La Fontaine , but they have not been excelled in English . To a chance remark by Swift , that a Newgate pastoral would make an odd pretty sort of thing , we owe Gay 's most enduring invention , The Beggar 's Opera ( 1728 ) . Rich , the manager , produced it , and it made Gay rich and Rich gay . Its prohibited sequel Polly ( l 729 ) , though less good , proved even more successful in print . Gay 's later years were uneventfully spent // in the house of his faithful patrons the Duke and Duchess of Queensberry . Though not strikingly gifted lie had the art of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " unpension 'd , with a hundred friends " . Gay 's longer poems , with the exception of The Shepherd 's Week and Trivia , hardly survive . Of the shorter , the best is Mr Pope 's Welcome from Greece , the ottava rima of which has a spontaneous flash and felicity . Everybody knows Black-Eyed Susan . Mention should be made of one piece by Gay immortalized by another hand , the Acts and Galatea which Handel set to music . Ambrose Philips ( 1674 ? 1749 ) occupies a larger place in the literary disputes of the day than his works deserve . He became a target for missiles of all kinds because he was a Whig when all the wits were Tories . His Pastorals appeared ( 1709 ) in Tonson 's Miscellany , his being the first , and Pope 's the last , in the same volume . Pope of course put him in The Dunciad , and Carey or perhaps Swift fixed upon him that perversion of his Christian name by which he survives . Philips had the qualities of his defects and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1723 he brought out A Collection of Old Ballads , including Robin Hood , Johnny Armstrong and the famous Children in the Wood . The ballads are , in the main , bad versions , but the collection was one of the earliest of its kind . The Distrest Mother ( 1712 ) , his version of Racine 's Andromaque , has already been mentioned . Thomas Parnell ( 1679 ? 1718 ) was born in Dublin . From his younger brother the famous Irish patriot was directly descended . Unimrtant as he now seems , Parnell nevertheless had perceptible fluence on the work of Goldsmith , Collins and Blair . An Elegy to Old Beauty is the unexpected source of a familiar quotation , and Nightpiece on Death an early example of a convention which ached its acme with Gray 's Elegy . The one poem of Parnell 's that ally survives is The Hermit , which tells the eastern tale familiar in c Latin of Gesta Romanorum and still more familiar in the French Voltaire ( Zadig , Chap . xx ) . His longest effort , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like others of his time Parnell as a sedulous translator . Anne Countess of Winchilsea ( 1661 ? 1721 ) had an eye for the ample beauties of nature , and having attracted the uncritical attention of Wordsworth , her blameless efforts were foolishly overpraised later Wordsworthians . The short Nocturnal Reverie ( cited by ordsworth ) is slight and pleasing , without entirely escaping the temporary note of elegance . The Spleen , a Pindarik Poem , full of icized abstractions , must not be confused with a better poem of same name . In spite of . Wordsworth 's praise the Countess of inchilsea is unimportant . John Pomfret ( 1667-1702 ) , like Lady Winchilsea , has been over476 Steele and Addison to Pope and Swift praised for his rustic note . His anonymous poem The Choice : A Poem written by a Person of Quality ( 1700 ) became famous because , in the usual fashion , people speculated about the authorship instead of appraising the verses . Thomas Tickell ( 1688 ? 1740 ) was an ardent Whig , who found preferment through his enthusiasm for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Addison incurred Pope 's enmity mainly in his protege 's behalf , and Tickell now lives solely as satellite , executor and panegyrist of Addison . His elegy ( characterized by Johnson as " sublime and elegant " ) To the Earl of Warwick on the Death of Mr Addison furnishes his chief claim to poetic honours . The great collections of the poets , especially that for which Dr Johnson wrote his celebrated " Lives " , have preserved the writings of some eighteenth-century figures who , without offence , may be called versifiers rather than poets . Their names figure in the allusive writings of Dryden and Pope , and we can therefore hardly ignore them . Brief notice , however , must be their portion in these pages . George Granville ( 1667 ? 1735 ) , first Baron Lansdowne , has already been mentioned as a dramatist . Neither his " Myra " lyrics nor such longer pieces as Beauty and Law and The Progress of Beauty deserve much attention . William Walsh ( 1663-1708 ) , a gentleman of fashion and place , won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like Lansdowne , he rarely fails to illustrate " the art of sinking " in poetry . He is better in some of his lyrics . The Despairing Lover and The Antidote may be mentioned as typical pieces . William King ( 1663  - -  1712 ) has already been noticed as a prose-writer ( see p. 472 ) . His most celebrated work in verse is The Art of Cookery in Imitation of Horace 's Art of Poetry ( 1708 ) . A sequel is The Art of Love in Imitation of Ovid deArteAmandi ( 1709 ) . With them may be mentioned The Furinetary , a very Innocent and Harmless Poem ( glancing at Garth 's Dispensary ) , Mully of Mountown ( Mully is a cow ) and Orpheus and Eurydice , all in a robustly humorous vein . William King is the most readable minor writer of his time . Sir Richard Blackmore ( d. 1729 ) is one of those unfortunate writers who live in the satire they have invited . Blackmore 's invitation is large and hearty . Having ( says Johnson ) in two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years more ( 1697 ) he sent into the world King Arthur in twelve . llis ardour was unabated by the ferocity of criticism , and in 1700 he published A Paraphrase on the Book of Job . Eliza , an epic poem in ten books ( 1705 ) , Alfred , an epic poem in twelve books ( 1723 ) , and , above all , Creation , a Philosophical Poem ( 1712 ) , demonstrating the providence of God , are in the grandest possible manner . Blackmore was s physician . Another was Sir Samuel Garth ( 1661-1719 ) , whose of famous production ( 1699 ) is The Dispensary , A Poem in Six Cant an early example of " high burlesque " . It ridicules a medic // squabble of the day , and is a successful essay in the mock-heroic . Isaac Watts ( 1674-1748 ) is one of those happily immortal authors of whom everybody knows something , even though they misquote it . Watts was an amiable and attractive character who compelled the admiration even of so staunch a churchman as Johnson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1706 ) , Hymns ( 1707 ) , Divine Songs for Children ( 1715 ) ( enlarged later as Divine and Moral Songs for Children ) and Psalms of David ( 1719 ) . Besides ambitious and unsuccessful pieces which we need not name , these contain everybody 's friends , the dogs who bark and bite , the busy bee , and the sluggard , as well as When I survey the wondrous Cross , and 0 God , our help in ages past , which grip at the heart , even of the least godly . When the simplicity of Watts really succeeds it has the highest kind of success . John Philips ( 1676-1709 ) , Oxford and Tory , not to be confused with Ambrose , Cambridge and Whig , wrote , in The Splendid Shilling ( 1701 ) , an amusing burlesque of Milton and a piece of real blank verse in the age of the couplet . Blenheim ( 1705 ) , another blank verse piece , is a failure . Cyder , a Poem in Two Books ( 1708 ) is a successful essay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poem of importance since Milton , whom Philips studied with profit . Elijah Fenton ( 1683-1730 ) and William Broome ( 1689-1745 ) were both translators " in Milton 's style " , and assisted Pope in the translation of The Odyssey , but not in Milton 's style . Their original verse is unimportant . Neither Edmund Smith , already mentioned as a translator of Racine , nor Joseph Trapp ( 1679-1747 ) , first Professor of Poetry at Oxford , calls for detailed notice . Henry Brooke ( 1703-83 ) , the gifted and eccentric author of The Fool of Quality , was a poet and ramatist long before he published that remarkable work . Universal auty ( 1735 ) is an attempt at a philosophical poem . A very curious piece called Conrade , purporting to be an ancient Irish legend , can hardly be without obligations to Macpherson ? unless , indeed , the oblligation lies the other way . David Malloch ( 1705-65 ) , who for prudcntial reasons changed his name to Mallet , just as his father , a Macgregor , had already changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some disreputable transactions in his life , and was rewarded with the editorship of Bolingbroke 's works . His first publication , William and Margaret ( 1723 ) , is based on an old ballad fragment . It is in the eighteenth-century manner ; but it helped to set that century on the road of true romantic poetry . His larger poems do not deserve mention . In collaboration with Thomson he wrote the masque called Alfred ( 1740 ) in which Rule , Britannia appears . It is not certain which poet wrote that number , nor is it important ; for it is the tune , not the poem , that makes the song . Edwin and Emma ( 1760 ) , another poem in the ballad stanza , suggests Goldsmith , and is less successful than William and Margaret . Richard // Savage ( d. 1743 ) owes his fame to an utterly unsubstantiated romance of noble birth and to his friendship with Johnson , who wrote his life . The Wanderer ( 1729 ) is one of the worst of long and didactic versetractates . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false air of pathos and indignation . It contains one memorable line , usually attributed to Pope , " No tenth transmitter of a foolish face " . Stephen Duck ( 1705 ? 56 ) was a more truly tragic figure . A Wiltshire farm-labourer with a gift for verse , he was taken up by the " best people " ; but , feeling unable to fulfil the absurd expectations of his backers , committed suicide . His Caesar 's Camp on St George 's Hill ( 1755 ) is imitated from Denham 's Cooper 's Hill . Aaron Hill ( 1685-1750 ) , a busy poetaster , playwright and inventor , managed to be both the literary foe and personal friend of Pope . In sprightliness , which he essayed , Hill nowhere approaches the justly famed Pipe of Tobacco of Isaac Hawkins Browne , a series of parodies which is one of the pleasantest items in Dodsley 's collection . Two other writers deserve mention , less as poets than as the servants of poetry . Leonard Welsted wrote a good deal of verse which gained him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is good and the attached comments show that , if he could not exactly produce poetry , he could appreciate it in Spenser and Shakespeare to a degree not common in his day . Christopher Pitt made a translation of Virgil which displaced Dryden 's in the favour of the eighteenth century , and wrote miscellaneous poems , including many minor translations , which need no comment . His really important translation , that of Vida 's Art of Poetry ( c. 1525 ) , is one of those things which are good of their kind whether the kind be good or not . No student of the history and criticism of poetry should fail to read Vida , and will lose very little of him in the version of Pitt . Not least in this procession of minor poets is the elusive and engaging figure of Henry Carey ( d. 1743 ) , creator , in the farce-burlesque of Chrononhotonthologos , of many quaint names and some actual lines of verse which stick in the memory ; probable inventor of Ambrose Philips 's nickname , " Namby-Pamby " , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musician , playwright , and , it is said , suicide ; who , in the end , lives in our hearts as author of the delightful words , and the almost more delightful music , of Sally in Our Alley . Many of the poets named in these paragraphs owed either their first publication or their wider popularity to Robert Dodsley ( 1703-64 ) , footman , verse-writer , playwright and publisher . Nearly all testimonies to " the good natured author of The Muse in Livery " ( 1732 ) are favourable . The publisher of Old Plays ( 1744 ) and of Poems by Several Hands ( 1748 ? 58 ) must , necessarily , have been a man of enterprise and intelligence , and students of literature are perpetually in his debt . // That every word by every poet named in the present pages ought to be diligently read is a proposition no sensible historian will maintain .

VII . HISTORICAL AND POLITICAL WRITERS i . Burnet and Others The historical and political writers of the period now under review may be grouped round the striking figures of Burnet and Bolingbroke , who represent two opposite views of politics and history . Gilbert Burnet ( 1643 ? 1715 ) was born and educated in Scotland . When he became a minister at the time of the Restoration , he naturally added politics to religion , for the two regions of activity were in fact scarcely separable . Burnet was not less fallible and faulty than most political prelates , but his defects have been magnified by the zealots , who hated his good qualities more than his faults . His impatience with Episcopalian and Presbyterian extremists diverted him from theology to history , and in 1673 he completed his earliest historical work , The Memoires of the Lives and Actions of James and William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documents inked by a thread of narrative in the French manner . In writing it Burnet had found the real direction of his gifts . Burnet came to ondon , and was at first well-received by Charles II , who had liked he Memoires of the Hamiltons . But though he did not retain official your , he was made preacher at the Rolls Chapel , and came into friendly contact with Tillotson , Stillingfleet , Tenison and other presentatives of latitudinarianism . The most important of his prodluctions in these London years , which were the years of the Popish Plot ? and the Protestant reign of terror , was The History of Reformation of the Church of England ( 1679 ? 81 ) . This , though it pealed to the spirit of the time , was a moderating influence . It is both sincere and readable , and has value as a record . Between Burnet 's greater works come several attractive interludes . e best of these is the account of the last phase in the life of chester , already mentioned . To a slightly later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Death of Sir Matthew Hale , an admirlc little biography . Soon afterwards , as if one great lawyer had him to another , he published ( 1684 ) a translation of More 's // Utopia , which , for general readers , is a much better version than the Tudor translation of Robinson . In the last years of Charles II 's reign , Burnet declined to throw in his lot with the violent Protestants . He was deprived of his appointments and went into exile . While abroad he became known to the Prince of Orange , and when the Revolution of 1688 established William and Mary on the throne Burnet was made Bishop of Salisbury . For Mary he had sincere esteem , and published ( 1695 ) an Essay in her memory . Anne liked him less , and the Tories mocked him , but he worked conscientiously for the Protestant Succession . We now come to the work which Burnet knew was the real labour of his life . The two folio volumes of Burnet 's History of My Own Time appeared posthumously in 1723 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rebellion gave Burnet his first impulse ; but his model ( and title ) should rather be sought in the Historiae sui Temporis of de Thou . The sincerity of his work was , from the first , disputed by irreconcilable censors , and his style as a writer has been as harshly criticized as his matter . Comparisons with Clarendon lead nowhere . There is no fixed style for the writing of history . Burnet has not the rolling periods of Clarendon , but his conversational manner is precisely that suited to his own purpose . He is excellent as a teller of stories , less excellent as a portrayer of the full-length character . Burnet may be charged with time-serving and lack of courage , even as a historian ; lie can not be charged with enmity to moderation and the right to think freely under the law . Contemporary with Burnet is John Strype ( 1643 ? 1737 ) who amassed a great collection of historical documents , and did not commit himself to print till he was fifty .

Then followed the lives of Bishop Aylmer ( 1701 ) ; " the learned Sir John Cheke " ( 1705 ) ; Archbishop Grindal ( 1710 ) ; Archbishop Parker ( 1711 ) and Archbishop Whitgift ( 1718 ) . Meanwhile , he had also been at work upon his magnum opus , Annals of the Reformation and Establishment of Religion ( 1709 ? 31 ) . The last of Strype 's important publications is his Ecclesiastical Memorials , Relating chiefly to Religion and the Reformation of it ( 1721 ) . Strype is a laborious artizan of history , not an artist ; but he is one of the first pioneers of historical research . Jeremy Collier ( 1650 ? 1726 ) the non juror has already been noticed as author of a celebrated attack on the stage .

Fanatical to the last , Collier was a schismatic even among the nonjurors . Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun ( 1655-1716 ) , a learned and patriotic Scot , takes his own place as an original political writer . His Discourse of Government with relation to Militias ( 1698 ) opposes a standing army , and points to the sea as our real defence . In the same year Fletcher wrote Two Discourses on the affairs of Scotland , one of which prescribes the drastic remedy of domestic slavery , especially for the Highlanders . He completed at the end of 1703 a short piece called An Account of a Conversation concerning a Right Regulation of Government for the Common Good of Mankind .

HISTORICAL AND POLITICAL WRITERS 2 . Bolingbroke and Others The historical and political writings of Henry St John , Viscount Bolingbroke ( 1678-1751 ) , were nearly all written in the latter half of his life , after the collapse of the Tory party at the death of Queen Anne . We need not describe his political career . The fatal flaw in Bolingbroke 's life was the kind of crookedness that made him uncertain whether to co-operate loyally with Harley or to work boldly for his own supremacy . When he at last decided on the latter course , it was too late . He lost the game and his career . During his prosperity he was the friend and patron of the " wits " , founded the prosperity club , made use of Defoe , and delighted in the society of Pope , Swift , Prior , Arbuthnot and other brilliant figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the production of a journal to support the Tories in a vigorous campaign against the Whigs . This was The Examiner ( to be distinguished from other periodicals of that name ) , of which between thirty and forty numbers appear to have been published up to the spring of 1712 . Swift and Prior had a part in it . During the first part of his exile he wrote his celebrated Letter to Sir William Wyndham , a masterpiece of lighter controversial prose , not published in his lifetime . The more stilted and formal Reflections on Exile belong to 1716 . When he was allowed to return to England , Bolingbroke opened the attack upon the entrenched Whig ministry of Walpole and $CSB r6
