Most uneasy diplomat in the Western Hemisphere last week was Germany 's Ambassador to Argentina , Baron Edmund von Thermann . Before his eyes one of the Nazis ' neatest , costliest propaganda machines was being turned into junk . What was worse , it seemed likely that he would shortly be back in Berlin where he would have to explain what went wrong . <P> Baron von Thermann has found Argentina a fairly fertile spot in which to sow the seed of Nazi doctrine . Though only about 235,000 of Argentina 's 13,000,000 inhabitants are Germans , many of them are well-to-do and influential . German-controlled investments in the country add up to about $1,500,000,000 . The Argentine Government , under Acting President Ramon S. Castillo , has done its best to turn an austerely neutral face to the world . But in spite of several stump-toed Nazi plots ( including one for German annexation of Patagonia , uncovered in 1939 ) , the only formal action that Argentina has taken against the Nazis has been to order the Nazi Party dissolved . The Party simply took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " organizations . <P> Last month a committee of the Chamber of Deputies , headed by young Ral Damonte Taborda , submitted a report showing that Ambassador von Thermann had received funds from these societies ( TIME , Sept. 8 ) . Last fortnight Investigator Damonte followed this with a report on the expenditures of the German Embassy . The figures were enough to make the Argentine press and Chamber of Deputies see swastikas . <P> Embassy expenses have risen almost 600% since World War II began . From the middle of 1938 to the middle of 1939 the Embassy needed only $835,000 to conduct its affairs , but in the year ending this June it had spent the whopping sum of $5,800,000 . The money had come from Berlin banks , from Argentine-Germans , from German business houses . <P> Where the money had gone was not easy to discover . Almost $900,000 might be regarded as legitimate Embassy pin money . More than half a million dollars had disappeared into the convenient anonymity of bearer checks for amounts as high as $200.000 . Better than $4,000,000 had just vanished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the earlier Damonte reports on Nazi propaganda work , produced an explosion . Irrespective of party , Argentine Deputies tumbled over themselves in their anxiety to know more , to take action . Introduced into the Chamber last week was a resolution , supported by all political parties . Its chief points : 1 ) Ambassador von Thermann had abused his privileges ; 2 ) leaders of German culture groups should be deported . <P> Busy drafting protests of innocence to the Argentine Foreign Office , Ambassador von Thermann had the added worry of an unpopular guest . This was Captain Fritz Wiedemann , who was ousted this summer from the German Consulate in San Francisco . <P> Captain Wiedemann suddenly turned up in Rio de Janeiro last week by plane from Europe ( TIME , Sept. 15 ) . To reporters he said expansively that he had a " special mission " in South America that would take him to Argentina and Chile . On hearing this , Deputy Damonte sent police to the Buenos Aires airport , announced that he would question Wiedemann closely the moment he arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
