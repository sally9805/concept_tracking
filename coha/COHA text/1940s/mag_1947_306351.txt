Hit Parade of 1947 ( Republic ) might have been one of the pleasantest surprises of the season if it had lived up to the best that is in it . As it stands , it is an uneven but unexpectedly engaging musical , featuring some nice , attractive people ( notably Eddie Albert and Joan Edwards ) , some nice songs by Jimmy McHugh and Harold Adamson ( notably I Guess I 'll Have That Dream Right Now ) , and some fresh story ideas ( by Mary Loos , Anita 's niece ) . <P> The best idea : Eddie Albert is a cocky , unsophisticated provincial with a talent for writing tunes and a misguided mania for hyper-sophisticated lyrics ( Psychopathology , psychopathology , you 're the girl for me , he yammers abstractedly , trying it on for the polysyllables ) . He is sure that all a songwriter has to do to panic Park Avenue nightclubbers is to write lyrics that insult them enough . But when the Big Chance comes , the customers do n't see it his way and Eddie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lamb are suddenly at liberty . <P> Most of the show is easygoing , as cinemusicals should always be and seldom are ; it is also unpretentious , as the big musicals practically never are . <P> Love and Learn ( Warner ) , like Hit Parade ( see above ) , is a comedy about songwriters trying to get ahead . But Hit Parade , by telling its story simply and with humor , and giving a reasonable facsimile of how entertainment people look and feel , is fairly pleasant . Love and Learn by telling its story with tinny wit , and shoving its inert characters through tortuous farcical situations , is rather a bore . <P> A Park Avenue princess ( Martha Vickers ) , fond of a songwriting pauper ( Robert Hutton ) , naturally pretends to be a girl of the people . Just as naturally , he first mistakes her for a schizophrenic kleptomaniac , next mistakes her be-limousined father for a sugar daddy . As anyone could predict , Boy eventually becomes so successful that at picture 's end he can stand the shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his touch of suavity , Jack Carson his considerable comic talent , and Janis Paige her banjo eyes and pretty curves-but none of these attractions can save the tired old story .
