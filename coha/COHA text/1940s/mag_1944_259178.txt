As in other wars , surgeons in World War II have found many new remedies that seem to speed wound healing . Last fortnight a new salve was announced in the Journal of the A.M.A. by Navy Lieut . Clifford Kinnaird Murray and Captain Camille M. Shaar . It is a paste of red cells ( left over in plasma production ) , powdered tragacanth and hexylresorcinol . Doctors have found it helpful in healing chronic ulcers and infected wounds , especially where circulation is poor . <P> Some other World War II developments : 1 ) chlorophyll , the green coloring matter of plants , which cut healing time by 25% in two-thirds of the animals it was tried on ; 2 ) high-protein diet ; 3 ) oxalic acid , which makes wounds heal faster than they do with dry dressings alone ; 4 ) onion and garlic paste ( TIME , March 13 ) ; 5 ) injections of ACS serum ( TIME , Jan. 31 ) , said to cut healing time of serious wounds from six months to one ; 6 ) Marfanil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uninhibited by the presence of pus ; 7 ) dried thyroid substance which , injected into rats , speeds up metabolism and cuts healing time 11% ; 8 ) vitamins , especially vitamin C ; 9 ) powdered tissue extracts as poultices ; 10 ) many new antiseptics . <P> Fifty-Fifty . Asked last week whether they use any of these remedies , both Army &; Navy medical departments said no : they always wait for National Research Council approval before using anything new ; most of the reports involve too few cases to be convincing . <P> What has cut World War II mortality from wounds to half the World War I figures ( present overall wound mortality : 4.1% ) is the growing practice of relying not so much on salves as on the healing properties of the tissue beneath . Every effort is made to treat wounds within the first " golden " six hours ( evacuation by airplane helps this ) , limiting treatment to careful surgery , cleansing and removal of dead tissue , a sprinkling with sulfanilamide or powdered penicillin to discourage bacteria , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Most wounds ( exceptions : head and face , chest , abdomen ) are left open for the first few days . If gauze is used , it has vaseline on it to prevent sticking . Plasma is given to prevent shock and restore blood pressure to normal . Shots of serums , sulfa or penicillin ( 50% of the wounded now get it ) are given to build up blood resistance against bacteria .
