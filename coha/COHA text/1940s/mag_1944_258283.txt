The largest doll manufacturer on the West Coast is a copper-haired , blue-eyed , thirtyish San Franciscan named Nancy Ann Abbott , who had intended to be a movie star . Last week Miss Abbott sat in unaccustomed peace in her blue-carpeted studio-office : by her orders all the telephone lines that connect Nancy Ann Dressed Dolls Inc. with the world had been disconnected . Her reason : " When that phone rings it means trouble . " <P> The trouble has plagued her ever since 1937 : too many orders . Though Nancy Ann has not taken on a new account since August 1942 , her backlog of orders ( about 1,500,000 dolls ) is enough to use up all her present capacity until the end of 1944 . <P> The Sales . <P> It all began when Miss Abbott left Hollywood - where she had moved up from bit dancing parts to leads in a few horse operas - to look after her ailing mother . A shameless doll lover , she dressed up a small bisque ( ceramic ) baby doll for a friend who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had 450 orders from admiring Met employes . Of her original " Hush-a-bye Baby " model she now says , " it became so popular we had to drop it . " It gave her no time for her main idea : to make collections of " storybook dolls " illustrating nursery tales and jingles . <P> Pretty soon , all the likely characters from well-known rhymes had been used , so Nancy began making up her own rhymes . They were so good that people wrote her letters saying " I remember that from my childhood . " <P> When she ran out of her own rhymes , Miss Abbott went on to the " American Girl series , " the " Dolls of the Day series " ( Wednesday 's child : a blues singer ) , etc . Her files now bulge with letters about little girls collecting her dolls the way boys fill in a stamp book . She has had word from Harrods of London that Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret Rose are among the collectors . The current collection adds up to 125 different models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold almost 5,000,000 dolls . <P> The Production . <P> As early as 1939 , Miss Abbott decided that the " made in Japan " label on the dolls she dressed was bad business . So she opened the first bisque doll pottery in the U.S. , in Berkeley . This year she took over a bankrupt pottery in Stockton , Calif . But she had to take on a war order : a $500,000 contract for bisque cups , platters and dishes for Navy hospitals . The contract fitted in : bisque tableware turned out to have the same firing temperature , and besides the doll figure can be used-and is-in place of fire bricks to regulate furnace drafts . But the dishes hold down her doll production to a mere 4,500 a day . When the contract is finished , the Berkeley and Stockton plants combined will turn out 10,000 a day-with room to spare in the Stockton furnaces for a byproduct : nests of bisque kitchen bowls .
