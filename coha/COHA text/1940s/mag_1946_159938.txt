There had not been such a howl from the bleachers since Fred ( " Bonehead " ) Merkle failed to touch second base . <P> Harry Truman had started the week prosaically , greeting 21 Democratic candidates who had come to the White House for his blessing . " The first business of mine , of course , " he said , " is being President of the United States , and working for all of the people of the country . My second business is to head the Democratic Party and I think the Democratic Party is the only party that has ever worked for all the people of the United States . " <P> But before the week was out he had blown his lines as President and perhaps blown the Democratic Party out of office . <P> That Is Correct . He had been pretty busy with the maritime strike ( see Labor ) and just ordinary politicking , when Secretary of Commerce Henry Wallace brought around a speech he had written . The speech was to be delivered at a joint Manhattan rally of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Arts , Sciences and Professions . Harry Truman , looking toward November , felt he ought to cultivate those fellows a little . They had grown a little cool toward him . He glanced at the speech , told Mr. Wallace it was O.K. and hardly gave it another thought . <P> But at his Thursday press conference he was reminded of the speech again . Bill Mylander of the Cowles newspapers had an advance copy of it in his hand . " In a speech for delivery tonight , " said Mylander , " Secretary of State-I mean of Commerce-Wallace says that- " <P> Did Mylander say the speech is to be delivered ? Harry Truman said he could not answer questions on a speech that had not been delivered . <P> " Well , it 's about you , " said Mylander . " That 's why I asked . " <P> Well , all right , Harry Truman said good-naturedly , what 's the question ? <P> Mylander quoted from the Wallace speech : " . . . ' When President Truman read these words he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " <P> That is correct , the President said . <P> " Does that apply just to that paragraph or to the whole speech ? " <P> It applies to the whole speech , the President said . <P> Did it not represent a departure from Secretary of State Byrnes 's policy , another reporter asked . <P> <P> No , said Mr. Truman , it was right in line . <P> " Make No Mistake . " That night , before a mixture of liberal and radical Democrats , well peppered with Reds , Henry Wallace made his speech . The rally was to open the campaign in New York . Florida 's Russophile Senator Claude Pepper had brought down the house when he cried : " With conservative Democrats and reactionary Republicans making our foreign policy ... it is all we can do to keep foolish people from having us ... drop our atomic bombs on the Russian people . " ( His speech was much more fully reported in Moscow than Wallace 's . ) <P> Then up rose Henry Wallace , while the spotlights beat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once he plunged into foreign policy :
