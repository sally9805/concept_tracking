The Presbyterian General Assembly announced this week that its biggest U.S. congregation is the 4,677-member First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood , Calif . But straight-laced descendants of the Kirk need have no fear that Presbyterianism has been luring in churchgoers with California-style hoopla . The secret of the Hollywood success lies in the solidly Presbyterian sermons and able administration of Pastor Louis Hadley Evans . <P> Burr Under His Saddle . When Hollywood called Louis Evans in 1941 , he was pastor of the steel-rich , conservative Third Presbyterian Church of Pittsburgh . At first , the un-Presbyterian prospect of sports jackets and starlets did not attract him . " I said no at first when their call came , " he said . " But later I realized it would be a burr under my saddle and that Hollywood would be one of the finest recruiting grounds in America . Also , I wanted to get my teeth into something . " <P> What Dr. Evans got his teeth into was a church with a membership of 2,378 , a conventional " high-school-Gothic , " red brick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the debt within the first year . Each year since then , on all his calls for money , his flock has answered by topping the figure . All told , his church members gave $328,000 last year , more than was given by any other Presbyterian congregation in the U.S. Hollywood First Presbyterian claims two other records : more new members during the past five years , the largest Sunday School enrollment ( 3,783 children ) . <P> <P> When Louis Evans graduated from Chicago 's McCormick Theological Seminary in 1922 , his minister-father had a nice pastorate all picked out for him . But earnest young Evans had other ideas . He decided instead to go to a tiny church of 29 members in the prairie town of Westhope , N.D. ( pop . then , 439 ) . <P> Strapping ( 6 ft. , 4 in . ) Presbyterian Evans needed only a few days to find out where to start . Then he looked . up the leader of the town 's young hooligans . The boy told him , " Yes , we 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go . " Evans promptly commandeered a hotel , rallied the town 's boys with saws and hammers to convert it into " Evans ' Gym . " By the time he left , three years later , order was restored and his congregation had swelled from 29 to 125 . <P> Questions &; Cross Reference . In Hollywood , 50-year-old Pastor Evans uses the same earnest , blunt sincerity that took him through successful pastorates at Wilmington , Calif. , Pomona , Calif , and Pittsburgh . A forceful , **26;118;TOOLONG pulpit speaker , he still likes to pose direct questions to his congregations . Sample sermon title : " Honestly Now , Shall I Drink ? " On an average Sunday , some 4,000 Hollywoodians turn out to hear what he will answer to such questions . After preaching three services each Sunday , Dr. Evans usually makes at least three other full-fledged addresses during the week . Explains one Evans admirer : " He does n't pound you down . He lifts his audience . "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
