Last week the Washington Daily News got around to a critique of one of the country 's better-known piano players . Wrote News Guest Columnist ( and Shoreham Hotel Bandleader ) Barnee Breeskin , fresh from half an hour 's " elbow-range " observation of Harry Truman : <P> " His approach ... is a firm and disciplined one . He takes no nonsense from a piano . He sits erect before the instrument and in full command of it . His wrists are rigid and his bony fingers strong and sure ... Not only does he play such numbers as the Paderewski Minuet in G completely and correctly , seldom if ever missing or muffing a note , but he evidences keen insight into the composer 's intent by subtle shadings of interpretation ... When he tackled a bit of Chopin ... I was downright floored . I knew he played well-but not that well . " <P> In short , concluded Critic Breeskin , " The guy 's good . "                @ @ @ @ @
