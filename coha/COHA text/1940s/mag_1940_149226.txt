Through the sandy , slash-pine country of southwestern Georgia last week rolled a brand-new U. S. Army truck and trailer . At crossroads , along the main streets of dusty little towns , its five-man crew went to work . Their job was to get recruits . Atop the trailer a loudspeaker barked a persuasive sales talk . Inside there were movies of Army life , three desks for interviewing applicants . It was the first of 18 rolling recruiting stations designed by the Army for its nine Corps areas . <P> As it has in all U. S. wars , the South was last week turning out more recruits than any other section . In one week last month the Fourth Corps Area ( all the Confederate States but Virginia , Texas , Arkansas ) set a U. S. peacetime record by enrolling 2,033 men . From the start of the current recruiting campaign on May 16 , the South has averaged 1,500 weekly ( New York-New England : 200-300 ) . <P> One reason for Southern enthusiasm was that in the agricultural South an Army private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothing , lodging , medical care ) looked better than it did in the high-pay industrial regions . One Navy officer gave another reason . Said he : " Most Southerners like to fight . " <P> Had the other eight Corps areas equaled the output of the Fourth , the Army would nave enrolled 121,500 recruits in the two-and-a-half-month period . As it was , 85,000 volunteers signed up for a three-year enlistment . This figure broke another peacetime record . The Army theoretically needed only 95,000 more men to reach its previously authorized 375,000 quota , but since several thousand enlistments expire every month , about 5,000 men have first to be recruited every month before any increase can be recorded . <P> Army men were jubilant over the physical and mental condition of the new soldiers . Cataloguing its new recruits ( after rejecting 30% ) , the Army found that 62% had attended high school or college , the rest had grammar-school educations . The composite 1940 recruit is a blue-eyed , brown-haired 21-year-old , rural , native-born citizen with a high-school education , 5 ft. 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the services is the rough , tough Marine Corps , whose boast is that its men are born looking for a fight . Limited to 20% of Navy personnel , the Marine Corps 's strength was recently raised from 25,000 men to 34,000 . Last week its roster was full . The Navy , with only 53,000 recruits to go to fill its authorized quota of 193,000 , was in no hurry to get them , figured that next March would be time enough to complete its full fighting strength . Reasons for the superior drawing power of the Navy over the Army were better pay , more chance to see the world . A leatherneck recruiting officer put it another way for his outfit . Said he : " It 's the . . . old oomph that brings them in . . . . " <P> These good tidings meant that the recruiting quotas set last May would probably be reached in a few months , but those quotas are already out of date . Today 's defense plans call for training 2,000,000 men to operate the complex machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recruiting could be kept up , it would take about six more years before 2,000,000 would be enrolled for training . The Army 's only hope for getting that number in a reasonable time remained the Conscription Bill , over which Congress was scrapping last week .
