txt Yesterday 's news that the Moslem League Council had accepted the British plan for a constitutional convention to create an independent India was as encouraging as any news that has come out of the Orient since V-J Day . With Mahatma Gandhi already on record to the effect that the offer is " the best document the British Government could have produced under the circumstances , " there is good hope that the representatives of the Moslem League and of the All-India Congress party will sit down together and try to work out India 's future . This deVelopment comes less than a month after the British Cabinet Mission had to admit its failure to reconcile the two groups by negotiation . It came in spite of the Mission 's decision that Mohamed Ali Jinnah 's project for an independent Moslem state of " Pakistan " was impracticable . Yesterday Dr. Jinnah was still insisting that " as far as Pakistan is concerned , Moslem India will not rest until it is achieved . " Yet he and his followers seem now to have agreed to something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted plan calls for a constituent assembly , to which the provinces of British India will send 292 delegates and the Indian states , still nominally ruled by - variously designated potentates , will . send ninety-three delegates . The major religious groups will be proportionately represented , and no communal issue  --  that is to say , no issue touching religious rights  --  can be approved without the assent of a majority of the members of each group . The religious controversy , deeply embedded in the social and economic life of India , has been transferred from the level of reckless agitation and occasional rioting to that of responsible legislative discussion . Since the proposed central Government will concern itself only with foreign affairs , communications , defense and the necessary budget , there is leeway for agreement . India 's troubles are , of course , not ended , even though they are entering a new and more hopeful phase . A few days ago a riot in the swarming mill district of Bombay threw a lurid light into one dark area of Indian life . The trouble began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tactfully referred to as the Depressed Classes or Scheduled Classes  --  threw stones at the funeral procession of a caste Hindu . In spite of Mr. Gandhi , who has worked , preached and fasted in an attempt to better the lot of these unhappy people ; in spite of a. modern movement which has admitted them to some temples and shrines and privileges long denied them ; in spite of the fact that their votes have been solicited by the politicians , the members of the Depressed Classes are still denied human dignity . Now they share the aspirations of countless downtrodden people who have listened to the worldwide gospel of freedom . Their leader , Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar , a member of the Viceroy 's Council and an internationally respected economist , has found wiser ways than throwing stones to get a hearing for them . They number 50,000,000 ? half as many as the Moslems , more than the population of France or the United Kingdom . Independence alone , within or outside the British Commonwealth , will not cure this and other evils in India . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
