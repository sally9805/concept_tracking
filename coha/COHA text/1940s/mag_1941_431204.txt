WASHINGTON the Capital is a symbol of democracy and America . Washington the city is a symbol of almost everything that sincere and thoughtful men know is wrong with democracy and America . Washington the Capital is the hope of world freedom ; Washington the city is overcrowded , badly housed , expensive , crime-ridden , intolerant , with inadequate transportation , schools , and health facilities . It staggers under a dilapidated and hopeless governmental organization , and its problems are rapidly getting worse . It is the most undemocratic city in America . The metropolitan district has grown in population from 621,000 in 1930 to more than a million to-day . No American city of comparable size has shown anything like this expansion . It is much greater than that which Washington experienced during the years of the First World War . More than 5,000 new federal workers are pouring into Washington every month ; and with them an estimated 4,000 to 6,000 others ? members of their families and employees of the private concerns which serve the Capital . At times the Union Station is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangers carrying their bags thread their way through the crowds to the taxi stand , where it is not uncommon to stand in line twenty minutes waiting for a cab . ( The taxi business is so rushed that many government clerks supplement their earnings by driving cabs in their off hours . ) Lines in front of ticket windows are sometimes so long that trains leave while would-be passengers are frantically attempting to buy tickets . A summary of current D. C. statistics is a grab basket of all-time highs . Two hundred and twenty thousand federal employees now work there . The government pay roll was up to $33,000,000 in August . Building permits for the metropolitan area are being issued at 1,500 a month . 1940 brought 82,500 outsiders to 208 conventions , another record . Retail trade is over $400,000,000 a year . Bank deposits are $440,000,000 ? the largest in history . The District government 's budget will reach $54,000,000 in 1942 . And so on . There are more automobiles , more new homes , more hotel rooms , more telephones , and more bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more disease , more congestion , and more poverty . Washington society is having the same continuous field day it had in 1917 . The parties are bigger and brighter . Hostesses compete excitedly for the new crop of dollar-a-year men and their families ( the " defense people " they are called ) with an intensity never in evidence over the New Dealers , few of whom had either social standing or money . Newcomers to the Capital are amazed at the indifference of many merchants who are selling so much they do not seem to care about either making sales or giving satisfaction , and at the shoulder-shrugging careless- ness of laundries , cleaners , and autorepair men , who are so busy that they seem glad to lose a customer . To provide desk space for the 5,000 new employees a month the government has taken over stables , ripped seats out of old theaters and installed partitions and desks in the auditoriums , conjured up " temporary " buildings , and has even used tents . It has taken over old residences and new apartment houses ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a time Leon Henderson 's OPACS had a kitchen and a bath for every suite of offices . As this goes to press there are persistent rumors , faintly denied , that the new Statler Hotel will be taken over by the government as soon as it is finished . All this in a city where many families of eight and ten live in a single basement room ; where four and five single workers share a room , and twenty may share a bath in a rooming house ; where some workers even sleep in shifts in the same sort of " hot beds " for which Harlem is famed . It is true that there are furnished rooms available ; some for single occupancy , some for double or more than double . The Housing Registry office has more than 3,000 listed . These will do for single workers , though the best that can be said for most of them is that they are kept clean and can be slept in . There are apartments vacant too ? at prices most defense workers could n't meet if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperate shortage of small , moderately priced apartments suitable for families with incomes under $1,500-and half the people who work for the government in Washington make less than this . So incoming workers must leave their families behind , and must double up with other new workers and try to cut their living expenses enough to send something home . The number who do this is reflected in the 2 , - 000,000 postal money orders totalling $23,000,000 that went out of Washington last year ? more in proportion to the population than from any other U.S. post office . Rents have gone up , though fear of regulation by hard-boiled Leon Henderson has kept them from skyrocketing as they did in 1917 . It has been common practice to jam three people into rooms which formerly held one or two ; and at little or no reduction per person . Thus a room which brought $40 a month as a single will now be found bringing $37.50 to $40 from each of two or three occupants . The crush in hotel space , always worst in the spring , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be building Washington 's largest hotel , with 850 transient rooms , if there were n't a good chance of filling it . The Washington Hotel Association insists there is no room shortage , refuses to cancel or even discourage conventions , and publishes impressive figures to prove its point . Visitors who must , time after time , search for another hotel after finding their chosen house full remain unconvinced . Scattered like measles in all parts of the city , surrounded by fairly respectablelooking red-brick houses , are Washington 's famous alley dwellings ? 1,700 multiple houses almost every one of which should be torn down , but now more crowded than ever . The Alley Dwelling Authority since its establishment in 1934 has made great strides toward rehousing alley residents , but the defense boom is making it almost impossible to demolish any kind of housing because of the impossibility of finding quarters for the residents . Yet here and elsewhere in Washington are 15,000 dwelling places without inside toilets , menacing an already precarious health situation . Here is the fountainhead of Washington 's ill-health and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop even for defense , lest their very continued presence make defense more difficult . Five years ago Washington 's hospitals were overloaded . Three years ago a report of the U. S. Public Health Service called for immediate provision of 850 additional beds , 110 new public health nurses , at least 3 health centers , and  | various other expansions of health facilities . Since then about 300 additional beds have been provided , a few public-health nurses have been hired , one health center has been built . Meanwhile Washington 's population has risen 25 per cent and the recommendations themselves are now out of date and insufficient . Within limits , public health is a purchasable commodity ; the city that spends the most gets the best results . The American Public Health Association recommends an annual expenditure of $2.50 per capita in Washington as a minimum ; the hard-working health officers now have only $1.27 available , and as the population grows the amount per capita drops accordingly . One hundred and fifty public-health nurses are trying to do the work of 300 . The tuberculosis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , but it is still 89 per 100,000 ? almost twice the national rate . The Washington Criminal Justice Association states that in 1940 , 5,961 reported major crimes resulted in only 1,167 convictions ? a poor record . Defense seems to have brought with it a real crime wave , and there is general agreement that 1941 's figures will look even worse : 19 cases of rape , for instance , two of them rape-murders , have been reported since the beginning of the year . Schools have been overcrowded for years and some of them have double shifts . Lack of teachers prevents any more being so operated . Even though a large proportion of new Washington workers are childless or do not bring their children with them , the new influx has strained facilities dangerously . Before the Tolan Committee on Interstate Migration this spring Superintendent Ballou stated that at least ten new buildings were necessary , with a large increase in the teaching staff . The building of transportation facilities in any city necessarily lags behind its growth . Washington has some fine new streamlined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandwiched between ancient creaky vehicles suggestive of remodeled horse cars from perhaps the Cleveland Administration . Buses are modern enough but most of them are small , and nearly as many government workers come to work by private auto as manage to sardine themselves into the public facilities . Taxis are cheap , but only cheap enough to be used by about 1 per cent of U. S. workers on their way to the office . In this city where the inadequacy of the public transportation system makes it necessary for 35 per cent of government workers to get to their offices by automobile there is garage space for less than 10 per cent of the registered cars . The rest stand on the street all night , except on some streets during the winter months when " No Parking ? Snow Removal " signs are put up , though there is hardly any snow and practically no snow-removal equipment . The streets are narrowed by lines of parked cars all night and glutted with snail-pace traffic all day . The traffic regulations are the most complicated that experienced motorists can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7:30 ? 9:15 A.M. , northbound from 4 ? 6 P.M. on week days and from 12 ? 1:30 on Saturdays ; two-way at other times . Rates in parking lots run as high as 25 cents an hour , a prohibitive amount for low-income workers to spend daily . There are actually government clerks who come to work at 6 A.M. to find a parking space , and eat a box breakfast and read newspapers until eight ! The traffic death toll is not high and has been kept about static in recent years by the simple method of slowing traffic down practically to a walk , a device which anybody could think up and which does little credit to the traffic management officers of the District . A new underpass under Thomas Circle helps automobilists but drives pedestrians nearly crazy by its complicated system of neon " Walk " and " Do n't Walk " lights . Yet the present crisis , brought about by America 's need to rearm , is only a sudden turn for the worse in a chronic  | Washington situation . In 1917 people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city has never taken its problem seriously or truly come to grips with it . Congress seems to have the feeling that next year federal expenses are going to be cut to the bone and most of these people will be going home and there wo n't be any problem any more . This hardly seems likely in the fall of 1941 . All these are mechanical matters which can be solved by engineering means , but the necessity of making the city adequate to handle its share in national defense must be faced . If it drifts much farther Washington itself will be a monkey wrench in the defense machinery through its sheer inability to provide office space and housing and transportation for the men and women who must work there , and possibly even through its inability to prevent epidemic disease in its overloaded and worn-out living quarters . So far the problem of getting enough office space has been solved mainly by taking over living space , though a new War Department building is functioning now , and another , the largest building in the world , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense offices before it was finished , and the Social Security Board never got a chance at it . Temporary buildings have been thrown up in sixty days within sight of " temporary " buildings dating from the First World War , and more are coming . These latest shacks look to the casual observer even more temporary than the 1918 models , but they 'll probably last just as long , for they 'll be needed . Decentralization is being talked about , and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board has been moving 1,200 employees to New York , while the Department of Agriculture plans to move about the same number out to near-by Maryland . Now if two such moves are consummated during the same month it means that a total of about 2,400 employees will leave Washington . In that same month about 5,000 will come into the Capital , effecting a net increase of 2,600 ! At least this is better than an increase of 5,000 . Private builders put up 5,500 dwelling units in the first half of 1941 . Government defense housing agencies are working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single women which is being built by private interests with a government loan . It sounds like a lot of housing , but at least 50,000 people , half of them government workers , came into the city in the same period . From the number of streets that are torn up one might get the impression that a great deal is being done to solve Washington 's traffic difficulties . Compared with the work that needs doing , as revealed this summer by a comprehensive government highway survey , it is hardly a scratch . This report calls for a $44,000,000 program of streetwidening , grade-separation , new bridges , and other highway improvements . So far there seems little reason to expect such a program to be pushed through until it is thoroughly outdated , which will not be long hence as things are going now . And even if it is put through immediately , it still does nothing for the mass-transportation system of the city , which is important to more people , and which , if solved , would do a good deal for the traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and needs it as quickly as it can be built . There have been several plans for it . It has been shown to offer a relatively simple engineering problem . It would not be inordinately expensive , and there can be no doubt that it would ease greatly the city 's problems . It may be needed as an air-raid shelter ? there are none in Washington . It should be thoroughly modern , with quiet , fast cars and large capacity , and it should be started not later than next Tuesday . We are laying keels for battleships that will not be finished until 1945 ; why not  | start the Washington subway , which will cost no more than a battleship and can be partly in use by 1944 ? Or does the Congress expect the war to be over by that time , and Washington to be a ghost town ? II All these things constitute really the simpler problems of Washington . Far more difficult will be the putting at ease of Washington 's soul . Here in the Capital of a nation which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without representation ! " taxes are under the control of Congress , and Washington is not represented in Congress . And if the tax rate is low it is because essential services are pinched and inadequate . Here in the Capital of a nation dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal , one-third of the residents are forbidden the theaters and the restaurants of the principal business area , are effectively blocked in their search for employment , are commonly charged two to three times as much rent as the other two-thirds are charged for equivalent accommodations , and are hated and feared because they do not like it . In the South the Negro is kept rigidly in what the whites say is his place ; but his place is made somewhat more tenable by a tradition of paternalism and a sort of code of responsibility and justice , however arbitrary . In the big cities of the North he is far more free to go where he will and find what employment he can . There is no paternalism , but there is a certain amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right to vote and in employment opportunities . But Washington combines the worst features of North and South ; here is neither the paternalism of Atlanta and Tuscaloosa nor the relative freedom of Chicago and New York . Negroes who have lived in many parts of the country say that nowhere else in America is there such bitter mutual race hatred . The Washington Afro-American calls the city a " cesspool of racial intolerance . " Negroes are being forced out even from their traditional jobs as waiters and hotel workers , and the chances for private employment are even slimmer than those in the Federal government , which officially does not discriminate ; but except for some few " co-ordinators of race relations " and the like , you will find colored people only as messengers , elevator operators , and building-service workers . The Washington Urban League reports cases of Negroes who had taken and passed Civil Service examinations and were called by telegram to the Capital from as far away as New Orleans to take emergency defense jobs ; when they arrived , and their color was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know " treatment and were stranded penniless in Washington . Even in the local penal institutions , occupied by two to three times as many blacks as whites , there seem to be almost no jobs for Negroes . Yet Washington wonders why two-thirds of its relief cases are black and two-thirds of its crimes are committed by Negroes . When Leadbelly , the Negro folk-singer , accompanies himself on the twelve-string guitar and sings : Home of the brave , land of the free I do n't want to be mistreated by no bourgeoisie , Lord , it 's a bourgeois town ! Tell all the colored folks to listen to me , Do n't try to buy no home in Washington , D. C. ' Cause it 's a bourgeois town ! Eeee ? it 's a bourgeois town I got the bourgeois blues , Gon na spread the news all round ! ? he echoes the sentiments of one-third of Washington 's population . Here in the Capital of democracy no citizen has a vote , for those who maintain residence in a State and vote by mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the vote . In the beginning it was the general assumption that citizens of the Capital were as good as anybody else . The charter of  | 1820 provided for election of a mayor and other officials and was in effect until 1871 , when Congress abolished it and set up a new District government with a governor and eleven-man council selected by the President and approved by the Senate . Even then Washingtonians were permitted to elect yearly 22 members of a " House of Delegates . " This government lasted until 1874 . It was a great public-works period for Washington , with U. S. Grant as President , and streets were paved and trees planted . The Capital was changed from a mud-hole to a modern city , but it all looked highly irregular to Congress , which was shocked at the expense although of course it had appropriated the money . There was an investigation of District affairs , charges of graft and corruption flew fast and thick , and when the smoke had cleared away the last vestige of suffrage in the District had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strictly under the thumb of Congress . There have been only very minor changes in this set-up in the past sixty-five years . Now the Constitution gives Congress the right " to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over such district . . . . " This has traditionally meant that Congress was to have complete and in effect absolute administrative control . It has never worked out well . As early as 1831 ( when the city of Washington still retained the power to elect some of its own officials ) President Andrew Jackson spoke to Congress : " . . . It was doubtless wise in the framers of our constitution to place the people of this District under the jurisdiction of the General Government , but to accomplish the objects they had in view it is not necessary that this people should be deprived of all the privileges of self-government . Independently of the difficulty of inducing the representatives of distant States to turn their attention to projects of laws which are not of the highest interest to their constituents , they are not individually nor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this District . Consequently its interests are much neglected . . . . " President Jackson , or anyone , could make the same speech to-day . It describes with rare succinctness what has always been the matter with Washington , and what is the matter with it now . Two Congressional committees concerned with other matters and lacking both responsibility to the District and understanding of its problems , are running the show . As it happens , they are unusually good committees at present . Pat McCarran , Nevada Democrat , is the active chairman of the Senate committee , and he has repeatedly indicated a sincere interest in the District . He has even said that it ought to have suffrage , though it is hard to see what he is doing about getting it . He seems more interested in depriving Arlington County , Virginia , of its vote by bringing it back into the District , from which it was detached and retroceded to Virginia in 1846 . Judging from newspaper reports of interviews with a cross-section of the county 's people , re-retrocession is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the fact that the Virginians for some reason seem to like their vote . If anything , the present high leadership of these committees proves conclusively that there ought to be a complete change . If the present members ca n't run Washington effectively no Congressional committees can . Things have more often than not been much worse . Washingtonians still grimace when they think of the days not very long ago when Tom Blanton ran things . Except in such emergency situations as the present , members of Congress live in Washington only a few months a year , and most of them find it convenient to live in hotels . They are detached from the life and problems of the community and extremely busy with other matters , as they should be . Senator McCarran , for instance , is also on the very important Appropriations Committee , as well as  | the Judiciary , Irrigation and Reclamation , Post Offices and Post Roads , and Public Lands and Surveys Committees . Jennings Randolph , who heads the House District Committee , serves also on the Civil Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . III Washington needs a strong man to take up her cause and get her straightened out . But who can do it ? If a Senator or Representative should fight hard for a new deal for the District he would need to spend full time on the job . And what would his constituents say ? They would say , " The so-and-so does n't give a whoop about us ; he lives in Washington and that 's all he cares about . We 'd better get somebody else to represent us . " Many experts on government have studied the District set-up during the past fifty years and published recommendations for improvement . Dr. Laurence F. Schmeckebier of the Brookings Institution , one of our ablest students of government , offered a first-class blueprint in 1929 . A " Citizens ' Efficiency Committee " offered another in 1937 . In 1939 Griffenhagen and Associates , a firm of public-administration specialists , hired by the Congress and paid out of District funds , turned in a most acceptable report on what should be done . Congress has listened to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precocious child of two , and has then forgotten them . It is much easier to peck away at the problem , setting up a new committee here and a new Board there , appointing a co-ordinator of this and that , submitting some harassed District official to a third-degree if he suggests that the District is badly in need of something . As a result , local government in the District is carried on almost as much by Federal government bureaus as it is by the District 's own , and nearly every Federal department is concerned with some part of the District 's affairs . The F.B.I. , the Secret Service , the National Park Service , and the D. C. Metropolitan Police all take a hand in policing and crime investigation . The Bureau of the Budget , the Comptroller of the Currency , and the General Accounting Office of the Federal government share the handling of financial matters with the District 's Board of Accountancy , Office of the Auditor , Budget Officer , and Disbursing Officer . It is beyond human comprehension to understand where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; to know what is handled by the District 's own government and what is handled for the District by one of the regular bureaus of the Federal government . Even Griffenhagen and Associates , apparently slightly dazed by what they found , made no attempt at an organization chart , being content to report vaguely but truly that the District government includes " branches of Federal departments , independent Federal establishments , agencies definitely attached to the main government of the municipal corporation , hybrid agencies , in which functions having local and Federal or regional characteristics are inextricably intermingled , and a bewildering array of advisory councils , ex-officio committees , co-ordinators , and co-ordinating committees with functions extending across the lines of other established agencies . Little of rhyme or reason , logic or consistency , is to be found in the whole conglomeration . . . . The inevitable result is confusion . . . . " The Griffenhagen proposal would establish a " District Administrator " ( essentially a city manager ) and seventeen administrative departments . A council would function as a legislative body for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power under the Constitution . Thus the report calls for a modern council-manager city government to replace the commission form which is generally regarded as outdated and undesirable . Griffenhagen is chary about the matter of suffrage , but  | the city should at least elect its council if such a government is established , and it seems clear too that the District should have elected representation in Congress and the privilege of voting in presidential elections . Let the District committees concentrate on framing and putting through a bill to establish such a government for the District ? one which would get to the root of things . Let them quit the endless deliberations and countless manhours of discussion of matter as purely local as the minimum age of children taking part in legitimate theatrical performances in Washington , or whether the recreation program ought to be under the schools or under a new board , or regulations concerning the sale of liquor at the new airport . If they are convinced that things are going badly under the new government , once it is set up , they retain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check . Democracy is fighting for its existence in the world , and there are better things for our legislators to do than furrow their brows over every purchase of chalk or extension of a sewer line in Washington . It may be said that this is no time for such an upheaval . On the contrary , it is exactly the time for it . If democracy is to survive it has got to make itself more efficient . We can not any longer afford the anachronistic , wasteful , and undemocratic hodgepodge that now runs the District of Columbia . The planners of Washington , from L'Enfant to Frederic A. Delano , have had a mania for monumental stage settings . The Lincoln Memorial cost $3,000,000 . The Washington Monument was cheaper at $1,500,000 ; but the new Jefferson Memorial will cost another $3,000,000 . The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and the Memorial Amphitheater cost over $1,000,000 . Mr. Mellon sank $15,000,000 into his art gallery . We seem to have no difficulty getting plenty of money for theatrical effects . It should not be impossible to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the housing situation , putting up adequate schools and health facilities , and for making Washington a decent place to live for people with low incomes , which would include 90 per cent of the people who live there . The effect on morale , especially the morale of the disgusted men and women who work for the government and have to put up with Washington as it stands , would be enormous . The whole gloomy mall is lit up at night , but there are n't any people on it , and there would n't be anything for them to do if they came . Maybe a fine swimming pool would help . Certainly Washington should quit frothing at the mouth because a new War Department building in Arlington may spoil the view from the cemetery and start thinking about whether it would be efficient and convenient for the people who will work in it . Washington must begin to realize that it is an expanding , changing city , and that the only thing about it which is not going to change is its continuous state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human-conscious plan . Planning is not a static , but a continuous thing ; it goes on and on , bending to meet new situations and facing new problems as they arise . Washington should listen carefully to such critics as Architect Alfred Kastner , who nourishes the peculiar notion that in a Democracy planning ought to mean planning for people and that it should take account of their needs before it takes account of avenues and architectural axes . There is a reason more compelling than the Capital 's own needs for planning Washington for use rather than for show . Other American cities have long had a habit of copying what is done here . Philadelphia 's new boulevards are very reminiscent of Capital roadways . St. Louis has a new and excellent waterfront development similar in many respects to Potomac Park . Nearly every State capitol looks like a small edition of the national Capitol . The hundreds of monumental new post offices and  | other public buildings that have sprung up from Fresno to Bangor in the past few years show the nation 's dependence on Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , livable city and watch others follow . Fortunately other American cities have not aped Washington 's local government . They could n't of course as it stands . But suppose Washington set up a thoroughly competent , democratic city administration , designed and run by experts . Such a pattern might point the way , and help rid other cities of the inefficiency and graft they suffer now . Washington has many good and patriotic citizens who have been butting their heads against the stone wall of Congressional indifference year after year , trying to improve government and housing and to get suffrage and representation . They are baffled and beaten . There are others called " Cave Dwellers " who were born and raised in Washington and who do not care very much . Some of them would rather not have suffrage for the District ? they fear the Negro vote , or they fear interference with the established real estate interests which are so profitable as things stand , or they simply do not care . It is not for the Cave Dwellers , nor even for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must rise in wrath and demand a new government and a new soul for Washington ? there are few of them and they manage to get along . It is for Democracy the Faith and America the Dream . By cleaning up Washington we do not necessarily wash away the sins and flaws inside Democracy . Without a new soul for Washington , however , Democracy can not have a new soul . If we can not , here in this one symbolic place , rid ourselves of intolerance , poverty , and disease , what may the critics of Democracy say ? If we can not here set up a model , a full-scale futurama of what a democratic city should be in government , plan and spirit , can we do this elsewhere ?  |
