AMERICA is on its way back to the proud position it held so long ? the reputation of being the greatest mechanical nation on earth ! It 's getting there fast by adopting a formula that has never failed , and by hammering it home to the youth of the nation in its schools and its shops from coast to coast . What 's the formula ? If you reduce it to words , it reads this way : sweat plus brains plus training . With one more important double-plus -- a place to get that training and an incentive to undergo it . It 's that double-plus that is being provided now on an unprecedented scale , thanks to three very excellent reasons . One is a $15,000,000 appropriation by Congress to pay for the education and reeducation of men in the skills so vitally necessary to speed national-defense production . Another is the awakening of states and cities to the fact that they can help themselves by helping their citizen. , off the streets into jobs . The third is the alertness of private enterprise to the gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortage of craftsmen . Take raw  | hands in and teach them , then you 'll have the men you want . " Chances are that you can see some phase of this inspiring back-to-the-skills movement in your community . Certainly , the evidences of it are plain if you dwell near the great aircraft plants , from United Aircraft and Wright Aeronautical in the East , to Consolidated in the West . Or near the steel mills and the automobile plants and the electricalsupply factories that serve this nation of yours . As an object lesson of what 's going on about you , consider a typical state , a couple of typical private companies and two typical youngsters who have lost their silly reverence for whitecollar jobs and who now understand that Grandpa was right when he said : " What if you do get your hands greasy in a shop ? You learn . And what you learn stays with you . " There 's the Connecticut Plan for Job Training . It came into being because a man got mad . That man was Carl A. Gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grayish thinker who is president of the Grenby Manufacturing Company of New Britain . One day , on a train , he heard an Oregonian complain  | about a $150,000 W.P.A. fly-casting pool near Portland . " Why , " said the grumbler , " it wo n't even hold water . " The thought of the wasted money angered Gray . He knew that back home in Connecticut the machine-tool industries had been short-handed all during the depression , while thousands of young men were jobless . And he asked himself questions . Why could n't government and business get together to train men for jobs that were waiting ? Why not make a survey of jobs and jobless ? Why not try to fit the two to-gether ? He put the questions to Governor Raymond E. Baldwin . " Go to it , " said the Governor , and he forthwith made Gray the unsalaried head of a fact-finding commission . Most such commissions get out fancy reports and stop there . Not this one ! GRAY established eighteen vocational plants . He got the use of school buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young men working instead of loafing . He argued some industries into letting their shops and machinery be used at night . He persuaded other factories to lend costly tools and equipment to supplement those bought by the State . And he broadcast the word : " Come and study yourselves into jobs . " There was only one restriction . The students must live in the communities involved ; obviously , the gates could not be thrown open to nonresidents , since local residents were footing the bill . Most of the students are between twentyfive and thirty . Some are younger and some ? those being retrained in lost or forgotten skills ? are older . The cost ? Only seventeen dollars a student . The results ? Well , for one thing they eliminated in these schools men congenitally unable to handle tools . That will be reflected in future accident rates , for such men eventually would have crippled themselves or their machines . But the benefits go much farther . Five thousand were graduated in the first twentyfive weeks . Practically 100 percent were placed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Whitney division of United Aircraft , at East Hartford , takes the graduates as they are or accepts them for its advanced school . Hartford Machine Screw Company grabs all it can get and asks for more . So do Colt 's Patent Fire Arms Company and many others . That 's what one state has done . Study now what Pratt &; Whitney is doing in cooperation with the Connecticut plan and what Wright Aeronautical is accomplishing in Paterson , N. J. , and Cincinnati , Ohio . Pratt &; Whitney established in August an advanced course for boys who had completed the basic course . They furnished building and machines and instructors , who were paid by the state . They put in lathes and drills costing from $1,000 to $12,000 , knowing that they would be treated with a craftsman 's respect . The students select their machines on the first day . They follow through on the same machines when they graduate into jobs . They do paper work , too , including mathematics geared to high-school graduates ; blueprint reading and drawing , and descriptive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the successful ones start getting pay checks of fifty-five cents an hour for a 52-hour week , with a bonus that sometimes doubles that . Why ? Because they can do low-tolerance work ? extremely delicate work in which parts must fit to a few ten-thousandths of an inch . The Wright company in Paterson is getting places , too . The number of their workers has jumped from 4,500 to 13,500 with the defense program . They advertised for skilled men . Could n't get enough . They went to the Board of Education . Soon a vocational school was opened with a fourweeks course and 3,500 applicants , with residence in the vicinity a " must . " In s'ix months 582 were graduated and hired , including 155 on engine lathes , seventy-four on gear cutting , 107 on grinding , 106 on screw machines . A student who graduates on Friday goes to work on Monday morning . He begins under a skilled machine operator and in a few days is turned loose on a machine of his own . There 's no limit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead man , with many machines under his direction ; a foreman in charge of a department , or , if outstanding , a production engineer . Wright 's interests extend to Cincinnati , where they 'll need 12,000 men to man their new plant , all to be hired from that area . They 're thanking their stars that Cincinnati 's big machine-tool and metal-working industries already have a four-year plan in operation to supply men who " know how . " THE Republic Aviation Corporation at Farmingdale , L. I. , is training 8,000 new aircraft workmen at its own expense in a near-by aircraft school . The training fees will be paid by the company , and jobs are guaranteed to those who pass their tests . The students , however , must be residents of Nassau and Suffolk Counties , on Long Island . But let 's go back to Connecticut for some of the typical products of America 's revival of craftsmanship . Meet Morgan Jones , a short , compact , light-haired man of twenty-five , who was  | graduated in 1940 from Yale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aircraft for him . Who said I wanted one ? " he asked . He got a room at the Y.M.C.A. in Hartford . He completed the basic program . He went on to the advanced Pratt &; Whitney course . He 's now in the company 's shop . And the foreman fairly beams at him as he shows his skill on a three-spindle sensitive drill , a Bullard vertical turret lathe , boring center liners on a crankcase section for a twin-row engine . Jones is one of the five percent who are college graduates . One who is n't Marcel Lacasse , who attended a Catholic preparatory school . He raced through the advanced school in only eighty-four and a half hours , compared with the usual 150 r 200 . Now he has a job doing the work he was trained for : miscellaneous boring , facing , rough and finished turning , centering , drilling , and undercutting . And it 's such boys as these that know the answer to one question so often asked : why do n't the industries simply train apprentices in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not always practical , particularly under the pressure needed in turning out planes and guns and tanks . They know the answer to another question : wo n't too many men be turned out as mechanics ? Well , look at the figures : The American Society of Tool Engineers estimates an immediate need for 32,570 tool engineers and 127,500 tool and die makers , to say nothing of the semiskilled men who must at least know their way around machinery . And A. F. Hinrichs , Acting Commissioner of Labor Statistics , estimates that 1,456,285 man years of work will be required on naval vessels and aircraft for defense during the fiscal year that will end next June . That 's why the country needs craftsmen . That 's why the training program is booming . That 's why America 's on its way back to the heights . And that 's why a horde of men are whistling at their work in a thousand machine shops today .  |
