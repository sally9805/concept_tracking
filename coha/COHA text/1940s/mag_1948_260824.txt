British and Belgian army groups last week held joint maneuvers near Aachen . The theme for the exercises was : " Strong invading forces have reached the Rhine and are attempting to cross it . . . " <P> That sentence summarized Western Europe 's fear . In the French National Defense Ministry 's Salle des Marchaux , where Napoleon used to brief his marshals , the five Western European nations last week decided to set up a watch on the Rhine . Implementing the Brussels alliance ( TIME , March 15 ) , the defense ministers of Great Britain , France , Belgium , The Netherlands and Luxemburg met and agreed on common measures against aggression-i:e. , against a possible Russian attack . They set up " permanent international command . . . under a permanent military chairman . . . " <P> The post of " chairman " was to go to Field Marshal Viscount Montgomery ; under him France 's General Alphonse-Pierre Juin ( now governor of North Africa ) was to command all land forces ; Britain was to get command both at sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weld five armies , standing at the West 's frontier , into one army . <P> The brave design faced serious obstacles . Some of them were sourly expressed last week by General Charles de Gaulle . Although no site for the permanent Western command had been determined , De Gaulle feared that it would be London . Said he : " Europe must be defended in Europe ... I simply say that England is an island . I ca n't do anything about that , neither can she . And I say to you that Europe is not an island but a continent . . . The natural center of a defense plan is France . But for the present , France is hardly present . The problem of European defense will have to be reconsidered when France has a real government . . . " <P> Will the British Cook ? A good many U.S. and British policymakers were reluctant to base a European defense system on France . Said one British diplomat in Paris : " The Communists or their informers sit in every French ministry . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military secret we reveal will be in Moscow in 15 minutes . " <P> De Gaulle 's blast had immediate effects . The French cabinet nervously asked London to postpone the official announcement . Field Marshal Montgomery , who had felt so sure of his appointment that he had prepared to resign as chief of the Imperial General Staff , was waiting in his new Surrey country house to hear whether or not he had a job . Never a popular general , Monty faced much opposition as " chairman " of Western Europe 's command . <P> One noteworthy criticism came from Belgium . Wrote Brussels ' Communist Drapeau Rouge : " Belgian soldiers loathe Buckingham Palace parades . They are afraid Montgomery might force them to eat that horribly cooked British food . " The U.S. was known to prefer General Juin ; and Juin , who used to be General de Gaulle 's chief of staff , flatly refused to serve under the proposed setup .
