Russia 's Andrei Vishinsky had thumped indefatigably , through eight weeks of U.N . meetings , for Moscow 's version of " peace . " His loudest bang , echoed by ing " noisy from whacks the at Western Communist " war-monger-propaganda machine around the world , was a proposal for a five-power non-aggression pact . <P> This week , in the General Assembly 's Political Committee , Vishinsky again drummed away at his favorite theme- " Western Germany is about to be used as ... a springboard for a new aggression on the Soviet Union . " When he had quieted down , the U.S. 's Warren Austin dramatically delivered the West 's answer to Vishinsky . It was a sweeping Anglo-American resolution on " Essentials of Peace . " Among other things , its twelve points would pledge all U.N . members not to use force or the threat of force in ways contrary to the U.N . charter ; to refrain from fomenting civil strife in other countries ; to carry out international agreements in good faith ; to promote human rights ; to grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the use of the U.N . veto ; to drop barriers which prevent a free exchange of information ; to give up a measure of national sovereignty for effective U.N . control of atomic energy . Said Austin : " If the Soviet Union is ready to perform these essentials , then Russia 's proposed five-power pact is not needed . If it is not ... the pact is a hollow proposal .
