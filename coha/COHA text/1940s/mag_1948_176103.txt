Astronomer Nicholas U. Mayall of Lick Observatory , Calif. , was taking routine pictures of N.G.C. 6964 , a spiral nebula four million light-years away . On one of the plates last week his practiced eye discovered a monstrous star that should not have been there . It was a supernova , an obscure star that had exploded suddenly . When Dr. Mayall photographed it first , its " absolute brilliance " was equal to two million suns . It had probably faded from a peak a few weeks ago of four million suns . If any planets had been revolving around that unstable star , they were certainly vaporized by now into scattered atoms . <P> Explosions of supernovae are the most spectacular phenomena in the universe , and among the most mysterious . Fortunately for everybody except impatient astronomers , they do not seem to occur very often . Each star system , such as N.G.C. 6964 and the earth 's own Milky Way galaxy , is thought to average one such catastrophe in about 600 years . The brightest local outburst , thought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1572 and was bright enough to be seen in daytime . <P> No one knows for certain what makes supernovae explode . One theory : when they reach some unstable state their matter " collapses . " The electrons circling around the atomic nuclei move inward and combine with the equal number of protons that they find in the nucleus , forming neutrons . These occupy very little space compared with the original atom , and can pass through ordinary matter . <P> <P> Attracted by gravitation , they flash down to the center of the star , releasing enormous energy . The reaction may spread in a short time through most of the mass of the star . The energy released is enough to blow off the star 's outer layer . All that remains , according to this theory , is a small , dense core of neutrons and a vast shell of flaming gas that burns itself out in a few months of splendor.
