 | Recently a distressed mother rushed into the office of a school principal . " Where can I get a tutor for Johnny ? " she asked . " He scored only 92 in an IQ. test , and I understand that 100 is the passing mark . I want him to be tutored so that he will do better next time . " It took the principal a full hour to explain to the worried woman that Johnny had not failed ; that a tutor in this instance could do him no earthly good ; that there is no passing mark for an intelligence test ; that 9 chances out of 10 , Johnny would receive the same score the next time . This mother 's bewilderment is not unique . Teachers are asked repeatedly about the meaning of I.Q. scores . " Will Jenny 's I.Q. increase as she grows older ? " " Can Susan 's low I.Q. be stimulated through good hooks and trips to the museum ? " " Does Billy 's very high I.Q. mean that he will be successful ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For centuries scientists sought a method of evaluating mental power . While physical traits lent themselves easily to computation and statistical study , the mind defied mathematical appraisal . A few early scientists drew up rough questionnaires ? no more scientific , according to today 's standards , than many current radio quiz programs . Others attempted to measure the size and shape of the skull and chart intelligence from dimensions . Mental testing , as we now know it , began in Paris at the turn of the century . Alfred Binet , French psychologist , devised the first series of oral tests , which estimated a child 's intelligence by the total number of questions he could answer correctly . Older children , able to cope with more difficult questions , naturally registered higher scores . Binet and his collaborator , Simon , soon found that for each age there existed a norm , or average score . Most 8-year-olds , they discovered , achieved a certain mark , while nearly all 12-year-olds tended to score a norm higher than the 8-year figure . Then norms were translated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any child of any age who scored the average 12-year mark on the Binet-Simon scale was said to have a mental age of 12 . Binet died before his work was completed . Other psychologists carried on . L. M. Terman , at Stanford University in California , felt that knowing a child 's mental age was insufficient . A boy of 7 with a mental age of 11 clearly was much brighter than a girl of 13 with a mental age of 11 ; hence the child 's actual or  | chronological age had to be considered . - Why not , reasoned Terman , divide the mental age by the chronological age to obtain the intelligence quotient , or I.Q. ? Thus a child of 11 with a mental age of 11 has an I.Q. of 11/11 or 1.00. the decimal point usually is dropped and the I.Q. recorded as 100 . A child of 6 with a mental age of 9 rates an I.Q. of 9/6 or 150 . The I.Q. of a perfectly average child of any age is 100 . A brighter than average youngster registers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below 100 . Far from indicating failure , then , Johnny 's 92 I.Q. merely reveals him as slightly less intelligent than the precisely average child of his age . His score , however , remains well within the normal range , for 60 percent of all children have I.Q.s between 90 and 110 . Twenty percent are below 90 ; the other 20 percent , above 110 . In general , psychologists group I.Q.s in this manner : 0 to 69 feeble-minded ; 70 to 79 borderline ; 80 to 89 backward ; 90 to 109 normal ; 110 to 119 bright ; 120 to 129 very bright ; over 130 very superior . Nature , in her craving for balance , equalizes the number of feeble-minded and very superior in any group representing a true cross-section of the population . The feeble-minded category includes the entirely defective idiots , the next higher range of imbeciles , and the most nearly normal group ? the morons . At the other end of the scale , the very superior children often are classified as " genius . " This use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as applied to a Mozart or a Van Gogh . The psychologist 's genius is an individual of exceptionally high intelligence ; but the term in no way implies special artistic , musical , or literary talent . Creative work is more likely to be done by a person who tests high ; but it is not true that any highI.Q. child will become a creative genius . DOES a child 's I.Q. remain the same ? Can it be raised by special teaching or by environmental change ? These are the questions parents most often ask . An I.Q. properly recorded by a standard test and skilled tester will , with very few exceptions , remain the same . It will not increase naturally and it can not be stimulated artificially . The word " intelligence " in this connection should not be confused with " knowledge " or " education . " In mentaltesting parlance , intelligence is the ability to learn . It has nothing to do with the number of facts the child has absorbed or whether he can recite the Gettysburg Address either forward or backward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older , reaching its maximum development when he is about 14 or 15 years old . A 14-year-old unquestionably can adapt to more complex situations than a 6-year-old . But each child has his own rate of mental growth , which remains constant . This rate of growth is reflected by the intelligence quotient ? that is , by the mental age divided by the chronological age . As mental and chronological age increase at about the same rate , the I.Q. is unchanging , and through countless retestings it will show only minor variations . There are a few exceptions . Children have made better I.Q. scores after having been relieved of physical handicaps such as total or partial blindness or deafness . Release from an extremely unfavorable home or institutional environment sometimes will enable a child to test higher . And in some cases a gain of 5 or 6 points has been traced to the beneficial influence of a first-rate school . And a series of revolutionary new studies now under way at Teachers College , Columbia University , offers indications that a college education may possibly add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But this view is too new for widespread acceptance , and educators still agree that by and large , the I.Q. is fixed , and tutors by the dozen can not bring Johnny 's 92 up to his cousin Judy 's 129 . What factors produce a high I.Q. ? The answer goes back to the old story of heredity and environment . Dr. Gertrude Hildreth , psychologist of the Horace Mann-Lincoln School of Teachers College in New York , puts it this way : " Bright children come from bright parents and good homes . " Exceptions , yes , but not enough to disprove the rule . CAN a child be too bright for his own good ? Oddly enough , he can . An 8-year-old with an I.Q. of 200 should be in high school . But surrounded by highschool classmates nearly twice his age , he would be at best a lost soul , at worst a freak . The more a child deviates from the normal range in either direction , Dr. Hildreth points out , the greater the likelihood that he will have to face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the surprisingly poor showing of a few high-I.Q. children in secondary school , college , or the business world . Normally , the higher the I.Q. , the greater the scholastic and all-around success that can be expected . But superior children sometimes run into personality snags . Or , goaded by their parents to ever greater achievement and set apart from their friends and classmates , they are prevented from making the adjustment essential to school or business success . Though there is no scientific basis for the old belief that extremely bright children are pale , spindly , and wizened ? in fact , the opposite generally is true ? the superior child , too advanced for companionships of his own age and too young for association with children of his mental age , occasionally will develop a withdrawn , neurotic , antisocial personality Long-term follow-ups by Teachers College of 60 superior children and by Stanford University of 1,000 such children have proved nothing more startling than that these children have grown into adults only moderately successful beyond the average . None of them was out of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens they have given better than run-of-the-mill accounts of themselves . But they have failed so far , although perhaps it is too early to judge , to fulfill their early promise , based on exceptional I.Q.s . The first Binet-Simon tests and others in common use today , such as the Stanford-Binet and the Bellevue-Wechsler , are given orally and individually and timed with a stop watch . In these tests , the child is asked , among other things , to follow simple directions , name colors , criticize absurd statements , locate the omissions in pictures , and find rhymes for given words . Since the last war , group testing has come into prominence , with several dozen approved group surveys now in circulation , including the Otis Group Intelligence Scale , the Pintner Rapid Survey , and the National Intelligence Tests . Printed in pamphlet form , they are distributed in class or assembly . The answers are written in spaces provided , and the booklets are turned in when the time limit is up . Though differing widely in content and form , all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as : Opposites : Underline the word in parenthesis that is the opposite of the first word : accept . . . ( receive , precept , deny , reject , spend ) . Analogies : Underline the right word : Dress is to wear as cake is to . . . . ( starve , eat , soup , cook ) . Number Completions : Write down the two numbers that should come next : 23581217 --  --  . Classification : Draw a line under the two words that tell what the thing always has : table . . . ( books , cloth , dishes , Iegs , top ) . Disarranged Sentences : Underline true or false according to the meaning of the disarranged sentence : season the brings is flowers that winter true . . false For children unable to read , write , or understand English , non-language IQ surveys stress performance . Fitting pegs into holes , counting cubes , discriminating size , and crossing out extra geometrical forms are typical non-verbal problems Even preschool children as young as 2 or 3 months are graded effectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple motor responses like reaching for a bright object or carrying a spoon to the mouth . Electrical scoring machines facilitate mass testing of high-school , college , civilservice , and Army groups . Before mechanical scorers appeared , grading and handling of data in large-scale surveys were tedious and expensive . The United States Army employs the l electrical scoring device for the Army ' General Classification Test , given to all inductees . The Army test , which in addition to gauging native intelligence , evaluates mechanical and occupational aptitudes and educational achievements , represents the most enormous mass-test ing project ever attempted . Although specific conclusions can not yet be drawn the Army survey has added immeasurably to educators ' and psychologists ' understanding of the problems of group studies . THE intelligence of adults is measured in terms of percentile scores instead of I.Q. ratings , because chronological age , t necessary factor in determining I.Q , is not relevant in appraising adult intelligence . Whether you are 25 or 43 makes no difference in mental performance . The percentile system rates the indevidual in comparison with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , may place her among the upper 10 percent of all women college graduates , while her husband 's score may rate him among the top 15 percent of electrical engineers . Classification of adults recalls the hue and cry raised after the last war , when  | the average soldier was said to have mental age of a 13-year-old child . That commotion was based largely on misunderstanding of the aims and methods of intelligence testing . The public assumed that the Army Alpha test proved the troops to be the mental equivalents of schoolboys of 13 . Actually not accumulated knowledge but learning ability was under comparison . When it is remembered that at 13 a child has nearly reached the peak of his learning capacity , the parallel between soldiers and early teenagers loses its more sinister implications . What good have I.Q. tests done ? A vast amount , teachers and psychologists claim . They have sifted out superior children deserving special educational opportunities . They have screened out backward youngsters who otherwise would slow the progress of an entire class . Teachers have obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes . Tests have aided in guidance work with handicapped and delinquent children and in vocational guidance with normal children . They have encouraged planning of special classes and schools for highI.Q. children . Parents , given a better insight into their offspring , have stopped nagging a 90-I.Q. boy to bring home a report card of straight A 's and thereby have avoided making the youngster a problem child . In dozens of technical ways the tests have provided statistical results necessary for psychological , sociological , and educational experiments . I.Q. tests have established their place in our educational system . They are routine in most schools . Many colleges ask applicants to submit mental-test scores along with high-school records . Postwar plans for most schools feature extension of present testing facilities . Parents , too , are displaying a new and genuine interest in I.Q. studies . Although few have mastered the fine points of testing techniques or can interpret the polysyllabic jargon of the psychometric experts , they are acquiring a basic comprehension of the subject . No mother needs a genius I.Q. to realize that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own children and a happier , healthier home and school atmosphere .
