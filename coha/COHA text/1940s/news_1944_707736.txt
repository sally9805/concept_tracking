txt THE TRAGEDY of the British coal miners ' strikes is that a large number of the men believe they are fighting a battle to maintain " rights " for their fellow workers in all , industries and consequently for those serving ! with the fighting forces . The main cause of bitterness in the mines is the long-beard propaganda that the only way to raise the miners ' standard of living is by nationalization of the mines . The claim for nationalization seethes below the surface . although this issue has n't been brought up in present disputes . Lastly , there is underlying bitterness against the mine owners which is being fanned today even though the Government and not the owners are responsible for recent wage swards In this tainted atmosphere such agents as Trntskyites find soil for subversive propaganda although it must n't he thought that the doctrines of such groups find any widespread political acceptance Unfortunately , not only in the mines but in industry generally there is a body of undisciplined and irresponsible youths who are apathetic to either ideas or duties but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretence at any moment . These youths are the product of war conditions : they have had their heads turned by unprecedented demand for their labor at high wages and many of them suffer from lack of ordinary peacetime discipline of family life . ? ? ? FINANCIAL ' WRITERS are giving their ' mantles of prophecy an annual airing now that the date of the British budget has been announced as approximately the third week in April . Some pundits expect no changes in taxation , partly because of the prospects of a heavier yield is3 the current year . Against this there is the prospect of higher expenditure , even if the European war is won this year . owing to the likelihood of the heavy cost of the Japanese war and of reconstruction . Moreover , Sir John Anderson . Chancel , lor of the Exchequer , wo n't want to encourage those who think the war is already won , which might be the case if no new taxes are levied . In view of these considerations it is probable - that there may be increased taxes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other consumer goods . ? ? ? PAY-AS-YOU-EARN income tax forms and tables used up approximately 3,000 tons of paper and cost $1.5 million for paper , printing and distribution Sir John Anderson told the Haas . But-ne denied any bureaucratic waste since the procedure was adopted after discussions with all concerned . The system begins to operate this week and some pay packets may be held up because of the failure of employers to make returns on wage lists to tax gatherers Many married men will fail to get their proper allowances owing to a delay in receiving their code numbers . But these are only growing pains which should be overcome in due course . ? ? ? " HOLIDAYS AT HOME " was even more the Government 's slogan for this Easter with fuel in short supply and war freight traffic putting a heavy strain on railroads . Last remaining railroad dining cars have been withdrawn , and the widespread ban on entering coastal areas severely limits the possibilities of travel So most citizens had to be content with cultivating their gardens . ? ? ? THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hsh for everyone this Easter and from April 16 there will be an extra half pint of milk per week per person . making two and a half pints . Two or three oranges per ration book still make their welcome appearance occasionally . and gin can now be drunk with real lime . A quantity of dehydrated bananas has also reached these shores , but it will be reserved for invalids , being too precious for the multi-tude ? " FULL EMPLOYMENT . " the ideal of post-war planners , does n't mean no unemployment , warns the curre it report of the ' Unemployment Insurance Statutory Committee . It points out that during 1943. a year of intense labor shortage . Britain spent nearly 1$11.2 million on unemployment benefits . I " Even in a community working at full strength as Britain worked in 1943 there are intervals of not working due to changes in ! program and other iaevitable causes " says Sir William Beveridge. chairman of this ; committee . ! Sums spent on unemployment insurance I during the war show how long it took Britain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unemployment benefits in pre-war 1938 totaled $208 million ; in 1939 it fell by one-fifth and by 1940 the coat was halved . In 1941 , with Bevin 's total mobilization gathering force , expenditure was down to $36.4 million and in 1942 it dropped to $15 5 million . ? THE DECIMAL ASSOCIATION is petitioning the Government to adopt decimalization of British coinage and the metric system of weights and measures . Members claim this would assist export trade in view of the fact that all foreign countries have the decimal system and that all European countries use the metric system with China now following suit . Undoubtedly British school boys and foreign tourists and servicemen would welcome the change . but the British are very conservative about such minor revolutions , as instanced by the recent opposition to a proposal to change the " rule of the road " by driving autos on the right instead of the left side of highways ? MANY MOTORISTS who looked forward to cranking up their laid-up autos when gas and rubber are again available have been shocked to find that two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irretrievably damaged their cars and they now are only useful for scrap .
