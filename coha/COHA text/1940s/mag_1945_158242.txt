The great island of Luzon ( 41,000 sq . mi. , pop . four million ) was the epicenter of a man-made earthquake which rocked the whole Japanese Empire last week . Off Luzon 's western coast , the Jap radio screamed , were vast U.S. convoys whose guardian warships were blasting the defenses in Lingayen Gulf , 100 miles north of Manila . The Japs said troops were landing . General MacArthur 's return to the Philippines , begun at Leyte last Oct. 20 , might be nearing its crowning achievement . Among the smaller Philippine islands to the south , landings had been made to consolidate the hold of the liberating armies .. <P> Almost 2,000 miles to the west , British carriers from . across the Indian Ocean flew off aircraft to blast the Pangkalanbrandan refinery on Sumatra . Northeast , 3,000 miles from Luzon , a U.S. Ninth Fleet task force stood in to the fogbound coast of Paramushiro , where the Japs ' Kuril Islands nudge Soviet Kamchatka , and laid heavy fire on harbor installations at Suribachi . <P> The whole area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China struck an aircraft factory at Omura , in southwestern Japan , and droned seven hours over occupied Nanking . Others , from India , hit at Bangkok . Still others , from Saipan , worked on the unfinished business of wrecking aircraft factories at Nagoya , and kept Tokyo 's air-raid wardens sleepless , night &; day . <P> On the Superfortress route between Saipan and Tokyo were hornets ' nests of Jap fighters and bombers : a surface task force of the U.S. Pacific Fleet steamed in and battered these airfields and harbor facilities in the Bonin Islands with big guns . The Third Fleet 's carrier planes hammered Okinawa and Formosa . <P> For the Japanese , who call this era Showa ( " Enlightened Peace " ) , the immediate prospect promised more enlightenment than peace .
