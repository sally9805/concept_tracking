Symphonic composers , like poets , seldom make a living at their profession . But sometimes their symphonies win prizes , and some of these prizes are big enough to keep them in beans for a year or two at a time . Biggest and most coveted prizes are : a Guggenheim Fellowship ( $2,500 ) , the Prix de Rome ( $2,000 ) , the Joseph H. Beams Prize ( two annually : one at $1,200 , one at $900 ) , the Pulitzer Traveling Scholarship ( $1,500 ) . This year , in honor of its 60th birthday , the St. Louis Symphony added a prize of $1,000 to this list , asked U. S. composers to compete . Nearly 200 responded . <P> Last week the St. Louis Symphony , having announced the winner , played his prize-winning composition . He was neither an established big-name composer nor a brilliant young newcomer . Instead he was a modest , wispy little man of 60 named Antoni Van der Voort , who had spent recent years teaching and fiddling in a WPA orchestra in Santa Barbara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his compositions . <P> Van der Voort 's prize-winning composition was a light , nostalgic Sinfonietta , 25 minutes long . To hear its premiere , the shy , stoop-shouldered composer packed his bags and went to St. Louis . When the audience applauded his work , he stepped diffidently out on the stage , took a bow . Critics next day found his Sinfonietta craftsmanlike , charming , melodious , compared it to works by famed Italian Composer Ottorino Respighi . Said Antoni Van der Voort : " The sun is shining today for me. "
