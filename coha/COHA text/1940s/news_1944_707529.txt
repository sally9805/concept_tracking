txt One year 's military training " for every boy when he attains the age of 17 or 18 " was advocated tonight by Frank Knox , Secretary of the Navy . " There is no safety or peace in unpreparedness , " he told , the annual dinner of the Cleveland Boy Scout Council . " The unspeakable folly of the theory that we are more likely to resort to war , or become involved in war , because we are reasonably prepared against the danger of war , has been made so plain that few will be found to deny it . " Therefore , I believe , thoroughly , that one of the best measures we can take to insure that our individual liberties will be preserved and that free Americans will remain free is to require that every boy , when he attains the age of 17 or 18 , shall be required to spend at least one year in training on land , or at sea , against the possibility that some time his services may be required to help protect the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejections by the Marine Corps for physical reasons , Mr. Knox asserted that in the future " we must spend more time , thought and money in improving the physical qualities of our people .

Rich and poor , boys from the city and boys from the farm , boys of all races and religions , all should be made to shoulder a common responsibility of personal preparedness , as a shield for the future security of our country . " Mr. Knox gave three reasons for starting now the agitation for universal service : An adequate Navy , Air Force and Army are necessary to " put ( force behind " the peace . At the war 's end troops overseas could be replaced by young men with a year 's training to serve in the adjustment period .
