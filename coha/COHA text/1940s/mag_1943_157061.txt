To John Parsons O'Donnell , Washington bureau chief of the anti-New Deal New York Daily News , a Philadelphia jury last week made one of the biggest libel awards of recent years : $50,000 . Loser was the Philadelphia Record and its publisher , J. David Stern . <P> On April 16 , 1941 Reporter O'Donnell sent his papers a dispatch which they printed next day and which said : " Charges that battlecraft of the Navy and Coast Guard are now giving armed escort to munition-laden British merchantmen leaving Atlantic ports exploded . . . tonight . " Next day the strongly pro-New Deal Record printed an editorial saying : " A few hours after the O'Donnell story appeared , the President denounced it as ' a deliberate lie . ' . . . John O'Donnell is a Naziphile . ... On numerous occasions , to all friends and barflies within hearing , he has broadcast his sympathy with most of Hitler 's aims-such as destruction of the British Empire , suppression of labor unions and liquidation of Jews . " O'Donnell sued for libel . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hampshire took the stand to defend O'Donnell . Tobey , a 100% Isolationist before Pearl Harbor , stated his belief , unshaken by repeated official U.S. Navy denials , that U.S. warships actually were convoying British vessels long before the U.S. went actively to war . O'Donnell testified that seven Senators and Representative Sol Bloom had told him so . O'Donnell 's attorney , former G.O.P. National Chairman John D. M. Hamilton , questioned Publisher Stern : <P> " What do you mean by bar fly ? " <P> " A man who hangs around bars and gets in everyone 's hair like a fly . " <P> " What did you mean by calling O'Donnell a Naziphile ? " <P> " I used the term to mean he was partial to the Nazis and their program , as we might say an Anglophile is sympathetic to the British . " <P> " What did you mean by saying O'Donnell subscribed to the liquidation of the Jews ? " <P> " I meant by that he agreed with Hitler 's plan to deprive the Jews of property , segregate them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the jury was whether O'Donnell 's story about the charges of convoying was true . A further problem : Publisher Stern 's editorial ( he admitted authorship ) was on its face libelous to O'Donnell 's character . Could Stern prove his charges about O'Donnell ? To the witness stand trooped Washington newsmen . <P> Said the Louisville Courier-Journal 's former Washington correspondent Ulric Bell ( now with OWI ) : " We thought John definitely anti-British . . . . " Kenneth Crawford , Washington reporter for PM , said he had concluded from remarks he had heard O'Donnell make that O'Donnell thought Hitler 's oppression of the Jews justified . <P> The London Times 's Sir Willmott Lewis described him as " an unbiased writer with a good journalistic reputation . " Warren B. Francis of the Los Angeles Times said he had never heard O'Donnell support Naziism . <P> The jury found for Reporter O'Donnell . But Reporter O'Donnell has not quite got the $50,000 . Publisher Stern 's attorney charged that the verdict was " a palpable miscarriage of justice , " , moved for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
