txt Politics and defense clashed head-on this week when Congress considered the nation 's vital need for new and enlarged airports . As a result , the Civil Aeronautics Authority will get $40,000,000 instead of $80,000,000 to begin work on a vast new network of landing facilities necessary to alleviate hazardous conditions caused by recent enormous increases in commei Chit and military air traffic all over the country . The precarious journey of the airport appropriation through Congress as a part of the third supplemental civil functions bill ( rates what can happen when defense gets tangled in a morass of politics in election year . Airport congestion these days is extremely serious . With increased Army and Navy activity , initiation of the enlarged CAA civilian pilot training program and the skyrocketing of conunel cial air traffic , airport construction , financed chiefly through the Work Projects Administration , has failed to keep pace with needs . Private Plant Ban CAA officials today view the overcrowding at some of the nation 's leading airports as definitely hazardous . So extreme is the emergency that a special governmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain airports to make room for the commercial and military activity . To meet the growing emergency , the Civil Aeronautics Authority has drawn up a six year construction program for 4,000 airports , including expansion of existing fields and construction of new ones . The total cost would run between $500,000 , - 000 and $600,000,000 . Recently , Robert II . Hinckley , Assistant Secretary of Commerce , took the proposed program to Congress . He asked for $30,000,000 In direct appropriations and $50,000 , - 000 in contract authorizations to begin work . He left  --  with the House Appropriations Committee n list of the 4,000 cities and towns that the CAA had drawn up In conjunction with the Army and Navy as the most advantageous sites for better airport facilities . Cities Feel Slighted The House approved the CAA plan and agreed to the $80,000,000 program for the present year , emphasizing the urgency for Immediate action . The bill was sent over to the Senate . Then came the incident that almost wrecked the airport program . A Senator acceded to newspaper- men 's request to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get airports in the next six years . News services sent out the lists over their regional wires . Then came the deluge . From Chambers of Commerce , civic organizations of all kinds and aviation interests all over the country came protests . " Why are n't we included ? " " Get us on this list  --  or else . " " Remember this is election year ! " " Are you going to let the Democrats get all the airports ? " The pressure was too much for many Senators . They began to question the authority of the CAA and the Army and Navy to make the airport allotments . Why should n't Congress be consulted , they wanted to know , For a while , it looked as if the old pork barrel might be rolled out and ? the century-old method of political division be applied to one of the most modern defense facilities . The Senate committee struck the $80,000,000 authorization and appropriation out of the bill . For five hours the Senate debated the provision and passed the bill with . out it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in conference for compromise of differences between the two houses , the CAA had been partially successful in convincing Congress that elimination of the airport Item would strike a dangerous blow at the Nation 's defenses . A letter was dispatched to the conferees by Jesse H. Jones , Secretary of Commerce , assuring them that President Roosevelt had noth. ing personally to do with the selection of the airport sites . In the end the conferees agreed to appropriate $40,000,000 to furnish " a good beginning " for the airport program . To make sure that if they did not get a taste of the " pork " in the gigantic program , no one else should , they specified that the President should appoint a board consisting of members of the Army , Navy , and Department of Commerce to determine the location of the airports . Thus , one key defense facility has met its battle with election- , year politics and come forth , with ' definite scars , but unconquered.                @ @ @ @ @
