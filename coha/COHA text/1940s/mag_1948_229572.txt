Beaten and embittered , Al Whitney swore that he would use his union 's last penny to humiliate and defeat Truman . " You ca n't make a President out of a ribbon clerk , " he bellowed . <P> One day last week the door to the President 's Oval Study swung open and Al Whitney entered . <P> Whitney ( hand outstretched ) : " It 's over the dam , Mr. President . How are you ? " <P> Truman : " Al , this never should have happened . " <P> Whitney : " You 're right , Mr. President . I got bad advice . " <P> Truman : " We all do at times . How are you , anyway ? " <P> Whitney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask how you are-you 're looking great . " <P> The two men sat down and chatted for a while . Then Al Whitney , his public recantation completed , got up and left . On his way out he told newsmen : " I intend to live for the present and the future . "
