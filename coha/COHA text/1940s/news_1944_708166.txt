txt On few subjects is there more confusion of thought in all countries than on the role and effect of foreign trade . But this confusion of thought seems to be particularly evident today in Great Britain , which has traditionally seen the foreign-trade problem with greatest clarity . This confusion is shown both in some British comment on Britain 's own post-war problems and even more in the requests that some British leaders are making with regard to America 's post-war foreign-trade policy . It is clear that after the war Great Britain will be in a very difficult position . She will have lost the great bulk of her foreign investments abroad , and she will owe a very heavy floating debt to the outside world . To meet this situation she will require an unprecedented export surplus . She will have to obtain this either by cutting down on the volume of her imports or by increasing the volume of her exports . As her imports consist principally of foodstuffs and raw materials for manufacture , it is plain that the greater change will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is clear as far as it goes , and the difficulties of the problem should not be minimized . But it is evident that both in England and here there have been a few needless and exaggerated fears with regard to it . It is frequently asked , for example , where the purchasing power will come from to buy these excess British exports . This is not a serious problem . The purchasing power will come precisely , whether directly or indirectly , from the claims held by Britain 's creditors . The same claims that force her to have the export surplus will pay for the export surplus . Britain 's outside creditors will not be able to realize on their claims except by buying British goods with them or selling them to somebody else who will buy British goods with them . It is only by taking British goods ( though this may be through a triangular or multiangular operation ) that Britain 's creditors can ultimately be paid . There is a great deal of confusion also in the advice regarding foreign trade being offered to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being told that it will be our duty after the war to supply an impoverished world with goods and capital . This would imply that we should make heavy loans , increase our exports , allow the exports to be paid for out of borrowing . and take a minimum of imports in return . For if our imports of goods and services equal our exports , we shall be making no loans on net balance at all , and we shall be supplying no more goods to the outside would than we take from it . We are urged , on the other hand , to reduce our tariff barriers to a minimum , and even to encourage imports by positive action , so that foreign countries can restore their industries by finding a market here . But this policy , carried to sufficient lengths , would imply that we should make no net loans abroad at all , or even that we should be net borrowers . Sir George Schuster , a director of numerous British banks and business enterprises and a Member of Parliament , has urged that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave some leeway " for others . If Sir George were merely urging that no artificial Government aids or subsidies be granted to American exporters , this proposal would be sound enough . But what he is apparently urging is that American business , even if it can produce a better or cheaper article than other countries , should deliberately refrainfrom producing and selling it . This would have bad results in all directions . In failing to make what they could make , American resources and manpower would not be fully utilized ; production would be less and unemployment here would be greater . The foreign consumer would be worse off also . Instead of getting a better article at a lower price , he would have to content himself with a poorer article or a higher price . That is n9t the way to-restore world productivity and world wealth . What Sir George overlooks is that the more America sells abroad , the more ( unless it makes loans and refuses to take payment on them ) it must buy from abroad , and the greater customer it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly , by trying to prevent trade from flowing in its natural channels , or by urging any country to refrain from its maximum production .
