The Communist radio , meanwhile , reported capture of Yingkow , south Manchurian escape port , and destruction of a government division there . By Randall Gould Special Correspondent of The Christian Science Monitor Shanghai After several days of intense , confidential discussions in Shanghai , the American consul general , John M.
