" COMINCH " corridor , on the second " deck " forward of the Navy Building in Washington , leads to the austere office of the fleet Commander in Chief , Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King . Down this formidable channel , one day recently , steamed Vice-Admiral Aubrey Fitch . He bore with him a topside-shaking plan . <P> The plan was to create a new office of Deputy Commander in Chief for Air , roughly parallel to the job which five-star General Henry H. Arnold holds down in the War Department . Navy airmen would at last have some of the prestige to which they believe they are entitled . <P> Ernie King was opposed . It would take a hefty task force to move him ( such as Navy Secretary Forrestal and President Truman combined ) , but such a task force was being assembled . One sparkplug of it was Assistant Secretary Artemus L. ( " Di " ) Gates , who last week was boosted to Under Secretary , a spot in which he can make his voice heard . A thrice-decorated World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red-hot airman . <P> Man for the Job . One obvious candidate for the new big air job would be wizened , frail-looking 58-year-old Vice-Admiral Marc A. Mitscher , a naval aviator since 1915 , pilot of the NC1 on the first Navy transatlantic flight in 1919 , commander of the carrier Hornet , which launched the Doolittle raiders against Tokyo , best known as the boss of famed Task Force 58 which has swept the Pacific from Pearl Harbor to Tokyo . <P> Last week " Pete " Mitscher came home from the Okinawa campaign . He was " embarrassed " by rumors that he had been killed ; he was tired but very much alive . He had fought long &; hard for the past five months in the Pacific . <P> Now he was due for a rest . After that , he was due for the shore-based post now held by Aubrey Fitch : Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Air , little more than an administrative post-unless he got the new job which airmen hoped he would .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
