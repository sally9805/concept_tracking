No one who cares for the honor of American diplomacy and statesmanship can read the President 's Hawaiian message without a touch of honest pride . One of the most distinguished judges on the Federal bench writes to us concerning it ; " What a superb thing this is of the President ! I never read a state paper , of such lucid , forcible , caustic narrative , and yet as smooth as a chapier of Macaulay . " Nothing that Mr Cleveland has written , nothing , as far as we can recollect , that any of his predecessors has written , has surpassed it as a feat of rhetoric There are but few adjectives or epithets , but the march of the narration is as close , as orderly , as irresistible , and for the Hawaiian ' oligarchy and poor Mr Stevens as crushing , as that of a Roman legion . From the first sentence to the last , the writer drives them before him in disorder , never allowing the smallest pause or stand in their flight . And the secret of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a good story to tell Every step taken , from the moment he found himself face to face with the treaty of annexation down to the last instructions to Mr. Willis , was what every American who cared for the honor of his country must have wished . The situation as he found it had all the marks of what the French-police call a " tenebreuse affaire . " The haste with - which the treaty was - sent to the Senate in the very last days of the Harrison administration , the pains taken to prevent any representative of the Queen getting to Washington simultaneously with the representatives of the Oligarchy , the passionate interest of the American minister , the eagerness to launch the country on an absolutely new policy in the matter of territorial expansion without discussion by Congress or the country , were all signs that there was in the transaction something that would not bear the light , something for which haste and secrecy were absolute necessities As soon as the President reached this conclusion he did what every statesman and every business man does when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquire and report , the locus in quo being 2,000 miles away , and only one side of the story having been heard . The abuse which the Oligarchs and their organs began to heap on Mr. Blount from the day he started was further proof ; if further proof were needed , - of the irregularity of , their proceedings . When he made his report , - it developed into positive raving , Mr. Stevens leading them all in vituperative incoherence , in falsehood and tergiversation But luckily the President was not obliged to rely on Mr. Blount 's report The documentary evidence which . accompanied it was a complete exposure of the annexation plot . Mr. Stevens was destroyed by his own despatches , and bythe dates of the various events of the revolution : These showed beyond question that there would have beenno revo-hition ,  - -  an.d the Queen would have remained , easily mistress of the situation , if Mr. Stevens had not literally put himself at the head of her adversaries and lent them the aid of the United States troops . Mr. Cleveland has here-only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity becomes at times almost picturesque - In passing judgment on Stevens , however , simple justice requires us to mention that he was in diplomacy as well as in journalism the prot  --  g ? and pupil of Mr Blaine , and that almost the first act of Mr. Blame 's administration , when he took charge of the State Department in 1881 , under Gen. Garfield ? was to formulate designs on Hawaii . He wrote a despatch to Mr. Comly , the then American minister to Hawaii , in December , 1881 , instructing him that the native population would soon disappear ; , that Hawaii " was part of the productive and commercial system of the Amecan States " ? whatever that may mean ; and that " the problem of the replenishment of the vital forces of Hawaii presents itself for intelligent solution in an American sense  --  not in an Asiatic or a . British sense . " " A purely American form of colonization , " he says , " would meet all the phased of this problem , " and he hints that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negroes . After a good deal more of the rather . cloudy jargon in which he knew so well how to envelope a subject of this sort , he commended the matter to Mr Comly 's " earnest and immediate attention " We may be sure , then , that when Mr. Stevens went to Hawaii as our representative , in 1889 , under Mr Blaine , he was carefully filled with these same ideas , and acted m perfect confidence that any measures he chose to adopt to secure the political control of the Islands would be welcomed , as they were welcomed , at Washington . Mr. Blaine 's life-long jealousy of the British , which he never lost an opportunity of expressing , became in Mr. Stevens a fixed belief that the British were trying to get the Islands away from him ; and probably if we knew the secrets of his heart , we should find that no man was ever more astonished than he when he found that no protest against his proceedings came from London . In his refusal to send the annexation treaty back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force to restore the Queen , which his enemies were sure he would do , Mr. Cleveland leaves the Oligarchs on the Islands to get along as best they , can They have , as they openly avow , got nearly all the real and personal property in the Islands away from the natives , and perhaps it is best that they should now be allowed to carry on the government as long as they are able .

The census gives $36 as the average value of an acre of land in Illinois , including improvements , and 7 per cent as the usual interest . Adding V 50 for rent of land , we have $8 00 per acre as the cost , including interest , of raising corn in Illinois . Allowing for differences in value of land in the . States named ( adding for Ohio and deducting something for Nebraska ) , it is seen that the returns of the corn farmers were large in- 1891. and 1892 , and about even with expenses in 1893 Producers of corn are not suffering as are their wheat comrades , but the former , nevertheless , have this year no large sums of money to spend for anything but the necessaries of- life Four representative wheat States were also chosen : WHEAT .

The Illinois estimate of the cost of working an acre of wheat is $6.50 , which , added to $2.50 for rental of land , gives a total of $9.00 - A glance at the table on the basis of $9 cost per acre ( which would More than cover interest on mortgages ) shows a very large surplus for 1891 . At a profit of $6 per acre a farmer who had 100 acres in wheat would clear $600 over all expenses and interest from that crop alone . All the wheat States , winter and spring , shared in this great profit . Another glance at the table reveals the fact that the receipts for the following year , 1892 , about covered expenses- , including in the latter term interest on investment or mortgage . But trade with the farmers was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet all spent . There Was enough in 1891 to pay off soiree of the mortgages and to indulge besides in a better house , or a piano , or whatever the fancy dictated . These good times were continued through 1892 - But the figures for the present- year tell a different story The receipts per acre in wheat did not meet the cost of production . If any surplus remained from the phenomenal year 1891 , it was needed to make up deficiencies . We enter the year 1894 , therefore , with the resources of wheat-producers exhausted It is , indeed , most unusual to find low prices concurrent with a poor yield per acre ; just ds we were conspicuously fortunate two years ago in having heavy crops and high - prices The present situation , of course , can not continue indefinitely , but when the change will come is a matter of conjecture .

TEE POPE ON BIBLE STUDY . POPE LEO'S- latest encyclical has been long preparing and has been awaited with much curiosity , inasmuch as it was going , so report said , to set at rest many vexed questions about Biblical interpretation . We believe- that those who know most about those questions have been somewhat sceptical in regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infallible man , to speak the last word on them , but nevertheless they have been anxious to learn from the Pope , if he had anything to teach them , and doubtless turned with eagerness to the epitome of the encyclical given out on Tuesday by Cardinal Gibbons . - It is a document which will doubtless seem to some timid Catholics as innovating and dangerous as some other of Leo 's utterances , but which , tested by the real achievements of Biblical scholarship , must be pronounced commonplace where it is not self-contradictory . It would scarcely seem to require twentythree quarto pages of Latin to prove that the Church ought to study diligently the supernatural revelation it has to communicate to men . Yet the Pope goes gravely and painfully at it , with citations from apostles and saints and fathers , in a way that irresistibly reminds one of the Committee on Political Reform of the : Union League Club powerfully arguing that a government without a revenue can not exist All this is simply by way of preparation for the really important part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Latin , " detailed rules for a thorough and scientific course of Biblical interpretation " This looks promising , but on examination we- find that his Holiness has simply got himself into two contradictions from which no one who tries to reconcile the historic Catholic position with modern methods of investigation can possibly escape . One of them is his certificate to the text of the Vulgate , " as the true and generally accepted text , " conjoined with his - the exhortation to a diligent use of Greek and Hebrew originals . Now it is precisely the use of the Greek and Hebrew originals which shows that the Vulgate is not the true text , the decision of the Council of Trent to the contrary notwithstanding . No conclusion of modern Biblical seholarship is better established than that the Vulgate is a poor translation of unsatisfactory original manuscripts , or that - the comparison of documents and early versions and monuments which has been going on so busily for three hundred years has brought about a text of the Scriptures incomparably nearer the original than the Vulgate can possibly be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat each other up He might have stuck valiantly to the Vulgate , or he might have come out boldly for the " best Greek and Hebrew texts , but he tries to do both , and that is too much even for infallible dexterity . The Tridentine decision that the Vulgate is the authoritative text was one great fetter laid upon modern Catholic scholarship , as regards Bible study , and in part accounts for the fact that so few names of Catholics appear on the long list of those who , since the re- , vival of learning , have revolutionized our ideas about the Bible . The other great fetter was the equally historic Catholic view that the Church is the appointed and infallible interpreter of Scripture . With the text settled and the interpretation settled too , what was there left for scholars to do I Into this contradiction , also , the Pope plunges just as if he were an ordinary man . He speaks ? of the " divinely ordained sacerdotal faculty of ecclesiastical teachers , " as the only ones by whom the Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 462 The Nati one to declare that " these must be well versed in Oriental and.classical lore and languages . " Why so ? If it is a question of scholarship , why is not a man not divinely ordained competentstO prono-unce an opinion ; and if it is all a matter of divine ordination , why summon scholarship into the question at all ? It is clear , in short , that the Pope is moving about in a world not realized when he undertakes to instruct mankind concerning the proper interpretation of the Bible . That question has been settled , just as other questions of historical and literary investigation have been settled , on scientific principles . Charles Kingsley 's advice to the young fellow - about ro read for orders , to take words for just what they meant in the New Testament , precisely as he would in Plato or in - Strabo , contains the gist of the matter . CardinalNewman 's assertion , on the contrary , that " orthodoxy stands or falls-with the sallegorical interpretation , " is undoubtedly the correct position for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can not escape without getting into serious difficulties
