Discriminating geisha girls came near to swooning over him . Austere drama critics agreed that no Kabuki actor had mastered his art more perfectly . A great lover , onstage and off , lithe , handsome , 64-year-old Nizaemon Kataoka was Japan 's Van Johnson , Alfred Lunt and John Barrymore rolled into one . <P> In the complex hierarchy of Japanese drama , the Kabuki ( literally " type of theater " ) , originated by Folk Dancer O Kuni in 1603 , comes closest to the western theater . Less formal than the classical Noh drama , its stages extend into the audience like burlesque runways . Actresses are rare in Kabuki , and Nizaemon was equally at home in both male and female parts . As the leading lady in Akoya he had to perform expertly on three difficult musical instruments . His interpretation of the murdered warrior in The Story of the Soga was second to none . <P> Nizaemon was in his 50s when Japan 's top actor chose him as leading lady . This honor earned him the right at last to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the height of his fame a decade later when he took up with the shapely , silk-skinned movie standin , Toshiko , and made her his mistress . Nizaemon 's adoring public could bear up under that . But when the Great Lover married his hussy and began uxoriously washing diapers and doing kitchen chores to please her , his prestige began to wane . Only his relatives and most ardent disciples , paying their ritual calls on the 1st and 15th of each month , remained faithful . <P> Last week they came as usual to the paper-windowed bungalow in Tokyo 's Harajuku district , but no one answered their knocking . They peeked inside . There , in a blood-soaked pile of quilts and blankets , lay Nizaemon , his wife , his baby , an old housemaid , and an 11-year-old servant girl . Tossed into Nizaemon 's garden was an ax , sticky with gore . <P> Tokyo 's police began diligently searching for a suspect . Conspicuously missing with 600 yen of Nizaemon 's postal savings was the servant girl 's brother , a pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's make-up man . <P> Four days later police found Iida . He was calmly reading a newspaper account of the murder in an out-of-the-way country inn . Sure , he admitted , he did the job : Nizaemon had refused to let him use his sister 's 15,000-yen inheritance . It had taken him , he said , only one stroke of the ax to kill Nizaemon , but rather more to cut off his wife 's head . He never had liked her ; she had refused to give him more than his regular ration for supper . <P> In the paper-windowed bungalow in crowded Tokyo , Nizaemon 's mourning relatives were already squabbling among themselves . Who was to get the vacant house ?
