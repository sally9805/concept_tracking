" Members of the Communist Party of the United States should not be employed as teachers . " <P> This sentence , included in one of the most significant statements on U.S. education in a decade , made big headlines last week for a report on American Education and International Tensions , published by the Educational Policies Commission* of the National Education Association . <P> It was the first time such a major group of U.S. educators had called for the total exclusion of Communists from teaching . The recommendation was not made without reservation : " At the same time we condemn the careless , incorrect , and unjust use of such words as ' Red ' and ' Communist ' to attack teachers and other persons who in point of fact are not Communists , but who merely have views different from those of their accusers . The whole spirit of free American education will be subverted unless teachers are free to think for themselves . " <P> The commission 's reasoning , and the professional eminence of the men who made the report , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet the principle was also sure to encounter problems of enforcement . Said the New York Post : " Communist teachers conceal their affiliations . How can they be identified unless the techniques of FBI investigation . . . are imposed on the campus ? How can that be done without imperiling the innocent ? " <P> <P> - Including Dwight D. Eisenhower , James B. Conant , William Jansen , O. C.Carmichael.
