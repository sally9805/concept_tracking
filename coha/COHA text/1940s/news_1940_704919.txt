txt Youth War Stand One Element Opposes Views of Dr. To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Arguing for universal military conscription in THE NEW YORK TIMES recently , Professor James Angell of the Harvard Law School discussed five points which , he said , were fallacies widely held to be truths among young Americans . These were : ( 1 ) Isolationism  --  the belief that what happens outside the territorial United States is of no concern to us ; ( 2 ) Pacifism  --  the belief that no lasting good can come out of violence ; ( 3 ) Distrust of our own institutions  --  the belief . that American democracy is too corrupt to be worth defending ; ( 4 ) Distrust of the British  --  the belief that British imperialism is as ruthless as nazism ; ( 5 ) Discrediting our participation in the last war  --  the belief that since America did not profit in the last war , she would not gain from ' entering this one . As an official of the Youth Committee Against War , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involvement and conscription , I should like briefly to state our point of view . Intervention Questioned 1 . Isolationism . The great majority of American young people are profoundly aware of and concerned with the interrelation of foreign and American affairs . We cherish our own democracy and we realize that a blow to democracy anywhere endangers it in this country . We know that each fascist victory poses new and challenging problems for those of us who wish to preserve free institutions . We are far from convinced , however , that American intervention abroad will contribute anything to the salvation of European democracy , and we are extremely fearful lest our own democracy might disappear in the process . One of the freedoms we are most eager to preserve is precisely the American freedom from the military regimentation that Professor urges . We are opposed to conscription , not because we do not value democracy , but because we feel that a precious part of democracy would pass with the adoption of universal military service . 2 . Pacifism . It is true that a large number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves against violence in any form , and we believe that if the history of modern war does not prove their contention , it at least does not disprove it . However , the vast majority of us are not pacifists . We are willing to defend our freedom , but we do not believe that conscription is necessary for true American defense . In this we are backed up by any number of military experts , who hold that a modern army is best built of men of long technical training and experience , not by conscripts with eight months in a drill squad . But our reasons , as I say , go deeper than this . We feel that through conscription we would lose the valuable heritage we may be called on to defend . Distrusted Institutions 3 . Distrust of our own institutions . The only institutions which most young people distrust are those that have denied the American way of life to millions of our people . These we might name as poverty , unemployment , insecurity , suppression of civil liberties . To those institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyal , and we find it difficult to believe that Professor takes seriously the proposition that any large number of young people " distrust " democratic institutions . 4 . Distrust of the British . Like many Americans , we distrust the statesmanship and diplomacy that have led Britain into a situation where war seems to be the only alternative to conquest by the Nazi armies . But I think it would be no exaggeration to say that most young Americans admire the spirit of the British people and sincerely hope that Britain will emerge a free land , able to make further contributions to world culture . Most young people do not admire British imperialism ; but they regard it as an unfortunate chapter in the history of the British people . This attitude is hardly equivalent to " distrust of the British . " 5 . Discrediting our participation in the last war . We definitely do believe that America 's participation in the last war was a mistake , and that belief certainly contributes to our consideration of what might be gained from intervention in the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in evaluating the present . However , we feel that we are examining the present situation on its own merits , and that is by far the larger factor in determining our attitude . Conscription Opposed Professor 's interpretation of our case against conscription is neither accurate nor adequate . We are against conscription because we are opposed to intervention abroad , and we believe that the temptation to go to war would increase greatly in the presence of a huge conscript army . We are against conscription because it means a break with one of America 's finest traditions  --  the absence of the martial spirit and the brass-hat psychology . We are not impressed with the argument that anything is democratic merely because it is universal . We are , as I have said , only too eager to defend our democracy . But we think that only limited minds conceive this defense entirely in terms of armaments and military man power . We believe more important than arms is the fight against poverty and social injustice , the fight that , if won , will make this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the demise of so many democracies . In the emphasis on arms and conscription we note a dangerous tendency to abandon this other fight . If it is abandoned , our democracy and free institutions will pass out of existence before Herr Hitler ever has a chance to challenge us . FAY BENNETT .

Poinson Ivy Is Not Regarded As a Fit Subject for Humor To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your recent facetious editorial , " Bring Out That Poison Ivy , " was evidently written by some one who has never experienced ivy poisoning . If he had he would not feel so funny about it . It is an absolute disgrace that nothing has been done to eliminate this evil . Our parks abound with the pest , the countryside is draped in profusion and even on beautiful estates throughout the country it is allowed to run wild . Just a little concerted effort on the part of State and local authorities , to say nothing of private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this pesky weed in a very few years . C. D. NOW York , Aug. 1 , 1940 . More Army Pay Urged Increase Believed Likely to Draw Career Men to Service To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Every true American agrees on the desperate need for a great and welltrained army . Conscription is urged because of the failure of the present volunteer system to meet the considered needs of the Army . As a matter of fact , there is every indication that peacetime conscription is not only unnecessary in the United States but is . a highly ' unsatisfactory method of building a capable standing army . Private industry has no trouble in raising great armies of men for the most arduous , hazardous and technical jobs . Waiting lists of the finest young men for positions in State and local police forces and fire departments run into hundreds of thousands . There are millions of Americans anxious to serve in any field that provides an opportunity for advancement , decent remuneration and a chance to take a responsible place in American life . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ files of any substantial corporation will substantiate these statments . Pay Unattractive Why , then , is the present recruiting drive in the Army such a complete failure ? Because the Army offers practically nothing . Men are asked to enlist for three years , at $21 a month , with only the most limited opportunity for advancement . Officers ' pay is so notoriously low that many of the best men are attracted into private industry . Present American policy contemplates the expenditure of millions to get the best equipment for the Army , but seems to make no effort to attract suitable personnel to maintain and operate it . Will the conscript army that it is proposed to raise represent any improvement ? Undoubtedly , a better type of man will be forced into the service for a year 's training , but as long as a career in the Army offers so little he will hardly remain longer . His first thought will be to get back to his job at a regular salary , or to his interrupted education or profession . Permanent Force Needed What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will be willing to make military training and the technique of modern warfare their life work . ? Such a force can be built only by raising the standard of pay and opportunity in the armed services to presentday American levels  --  levels at which men will volunteer for and remain in the service for long periods . A basic rate of $80 to $85 a month for privates , with the usual allowance and similar advances for all ratings plus an up-todate system of promotion not by seniority but on the basis of merit should make such an army a reality . Even the strongest advocates of peacetime conscription admit that the system is exactly what millions of our ancestors settled in America to avoid . What could be more truly American than a well-paid army of expert volunteers . In such an army there would be no danger of fifth columnism , desertion and revolt such as apparently figured in the collapse of the conscript Ninth Army of General Corap at Sedan . ? CHARLES H. ABBOTT . New Haven , Conn. , July 30 , 1940 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The isolationists talk as though they alone were the custodians of American " traditions and ideals . " Some of us who differ with them have enough love for our own land to make it difficult to talk glibly of patriotism . It is too easy to cheapen that word . But there are moments when I wonder whether it is the same nation that we both love . For the nation I have in mind was never timid . Often its leaders have been short-sighted , stupid , or inadequate in other ways ; but when they have been timid the democracy has taken leadership from them as quickly as possible . One hundred million people have to ' weigh , consider , select , and elect . They work through Congress , and Congress , as a whole , is never as wise or intelligent as the whole people , because it is composed not always of outstanding men who were drafted to serve , but too often of self-selected men who sought the job . It is our - good fortune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process . But as long as little men are there , or short-sighted men who can not see beyond their own noses , and their own brief eminence , they can talk louder than any one else and can seem to be the voice of the people . Depressing Utterances So , when I hear the voice of timidity , I know my nation is not being represented at the moment . Every page of its past history proves that . Yet it is depressing to hear an American Senator shouting , " Everybody keep your seats ! You will be perfectly safe if you do n't move ! The world is not on fire  --  and even if it is , we may get hurt if we try to help put it out , " So , too , when I hear of some " youth " organization which places the slogan " Safety first " above all other slogans , I know it is not the young men of my nation speaking , but the voice of a few adult busybodies who spend their days trying to organize " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articulate . " The nation I have in mind was never wholly selfish . I say this despite the cynical assertions of young history instructors who like to call themselves " realists , " and to tell those even younger than themselves about the beefpackers and the sugar merchants and the self-seekers generally who have tricked us into other wars ; and to jeer at those of us who tried so futilely to make a world safe for democracy . Past Activities I saw our boys at the front from Toul to the Vosges , and I know that most of them believed , underneath the wisecracking and the horse-play , that they were saving democracy , or helping France . There are worse ways to die than in the belief that you are serving humanity . The nation I have in mind could not help but take part , however much it had begun to hate war ; and I am glad that our boys who died in France did so without knowing that little men in Congresses and Parliaments would later destroy all that was accomplished . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chivalrous than an individual . The nation I have in mind , instead of demanding cash from a people in trouble , paid Spain for her property in the Philippines , returned a Boxer indemnity and sent millions in food and medicines to a beaten foe . But let us now be wholly selfish , as well as timid , and what do we gain ? If England , though beaten almost to her knees , wins in the end , we can doubtless exist without friends and can stomach our shame ; our isolationists at least will not feel any . If she loses , then the wall which will shut us in will be built not by us but by an arrogant Europe and Japan and totalitarians to the south of us ; and we may charge them cash to our heart 's content for whatever they deign to fetch in their own ships . But I shall not like to have our sons reminding us that we allowed Hitler to have his own way in the world for a terrible decade . We must tell them we believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then conquer his enemies one nation at a time , while we dreamed of insulation and isolation , in a centuryterrible decade . BuRDES JOHNSON . Schenectady , N. Y. , July 31 , 1940 . Democracy Is Confused Four Separate Movements Found Under Common Title To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : It seems to me that the American public tends to confuse four separate movements under the common title " democracy . " The four are democracy proper , the parliamentary system , liberalism and humanitarianism . We happen to have all four in the United States , but the quartet exists here merely as an accidental interlocking directorate for which we may give thanks . But in other lands the four do not always go together . England , for example , is humane , liberal and parliamentary , but I have seldom , if ever , met an Englishman who really believed that his country was democratic . Russia was humane in theory , democratic , but never liberal or parliamentary . Stalin nuw claims that the Soviets are parliamentary , but that is nonsense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything but humane , liberel ur parliamentary . The lamented French liberal and democratic , but never was liberal , and democratic , but never was especially humane . What I object to is the grouping of four different virtues under a single label . Democracy proper dates from the Jacobins of 1792 . Liberalism came in with Adam Smith 's epic book , " The Wealth of Nations , " in 1776 . The parliamentary system , not necessarily democratic , dates back to the Middle Ages HT its English ( not Scottish ) origin . The humanitarian drive began about 1820 , as a reaction to the horrors of the Napoleonic wars , and the benevolent Victorians of all civilized countries helped carry it forward . Democracy , pure and simple , means the mob in the street , and rule by 51 per cent of the people . What happens to the other 49 per cent does not concern democracy at all ; that is the business of liberalism . Frederick the Great is a perfect example of a liberal . He liked , and fostered , minorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democratic nor parliamentary nor especially humane . Bonaparte was not liberal , humane or parliamentary ; but he was quite democratic . Cromwell at times was humane and democratic , but hardly parliamentary , and his Puritan traits were illiberal . Caesar resembled Bonaparte , while George Washington appears to have been strongly parliamentary , but a trifle weak in the other three respects . For this reason  --  or rather for these four reasons ? I am inclined to distrust wars fought under the blanket label of " democracy . " For the American quadruple grouping is hardly understood abroad , outside , perhaps , of the British Dominions , Finland and Costa Rica . It is better to speak of the Big Four , and that Big Four is virtually indigenous to N. Y , , ASHugaw.1 , North America . 19H40a.stings-on-Hudson , Britain 's Aims Defined Molotoff 's Charge of Imperialism Called Marxian Fallacy To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Premier Molotoff 's description of England 's struggle as imperialistic reflects a common fallacy among the latter-day Marxian saints , who accept without question the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left wing thinkers , and through their influence in many more responsible minds , the word imperialism has become synonymous with capitalism . It is , according to this mistaken view , nothing more than ill-begotten surplus capital seeking further fields for investment and exploitation . However patly such a thesis may have applied to the scrambles of the nineteenth century , it is not supportable by the thoroughly demonstrated facts of our own time . The tremendous British war budget , cheerfully supported by the Tory class , which sees in it its own ruin as a class , the impatient aggressiveness of the British Labor party , and the professed determination of a united England to spend its wealth , homes and lives in the struggle belie the suggestion that she is fighting for materialistic ends . Cornfort and a certain kind of security might still be hers at the price of honor . and ideals . She has chosen the latter ? a chocie , it must be admitted , not easily understood by exponents of economic determination . No Delusions Britain is fighting in defense of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and services is an incidental issue . She knows that the struggle will leave her poor and exhausted , even in victory . She harbors no , illusions about a speedy economic comeback . She has reckoned the cost in blood , tears and treasure of the choice she has made . But she could have made no other , for instincts in the British race , immeasurably richer and more deeply rooted than economic determinism , have compelled her to this choice . And it is significant that the choice has been ' made by a united England , of rich and poor alike , in defense of a heritage that obscures and transcends the special interest of class . It is not to be expected that Marxian self-delusionists can or will comprehend this . But all Americans who are more than Marxians say they are , will comprehend the meaning of a moral empire . They will not shrink from the taunt of " imperalist , " from the impluse of expansion , or from the admitted desire to found a world empire built upon such a rock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only tools which , it has been demonstrated , are effective today . Difference in Aims Might alone enforces right . Larger nations must be prepared either to compel or repel their neighbors . But even while we employ the same weapons as our enemies , the difference is as great as that of a. gun in the hands of a gangster or a policeman  --  a difference easily measured by the reality of our moral emAtreerica must not shrink from imperialism . The choice for us is the same as it was for England , and the hour of decision is nearer than we think . It is now ! Our choice must be the same as theirs , and having made it we must face its fullest implication . The greatest democratic nation in the world can owe but one duty to itself and to the ideal which nourishes it ? to defend and propagate that ideal in each any every corner of the globe with all the means at its command .
