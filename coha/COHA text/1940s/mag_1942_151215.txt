At the start of World War II , fat , frisky young King Farouk I of Egypt suffered from nightmares in which he was chased by an angry lion . Haggard from loss of sleep , Farouk sought counsel of crabbed , pro-Axis Sheik Mustafa El-Maraghi , rector of the ancient Moslem University of El-Azhar . " You will not rest until you have shot a lion , " said El-Maraghi . Thereupon the king went to the zoo and shot two lions in their cage . The nightmares continued . " Young fool , " said El-Maraghi , " I spoke in symbols-the lion that has been chasing you is Britain . " <P> Apocryphal or not , Egyptians say this story explains why Farouk has no love for the British , why last week pro-British Prime Minister Sirry Pasha was ousted and the Government turned over to Farouk 's old enemy . Nahas Pasha , and his rabidly nationalistic WAFD Party . Officially the crisis was caused by El-Azhar University student riots ( and Farouk 's anger at not being informed ) when diplomatic relations were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in the Government were more deeply rooted . <P> As new Prime Minister and Military Governor , Nahas Pasha promised the ragged fellahin ( peasants ) and lower-middle-class shopkeepers in his Party that " draconic measures would be taken against rabble-rousers . " Having protested against " the horrors of war " in already embattled Egypt , in the next breath , he promised the British strict adherence to the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Pact ( making Egypt and Britain wartime allies ) which Nahas Pasha , accompanied by the wealthy , plump young bride he married late in life , signed personally in London . This done , he called an election , remembering that in 1937 , Farouk 's electioneers had slugged and cheated him out of office . <P> For Nahas Pasha thus to return was gall to Farouk . But there is a proverb in the Near East which says : " A dog does not bite another dog from the same neighborhood . " Farouk has shouted " Egypt for the Egyptians " as loudly as any of Nahas Pasha 's fellahin . And while the fellahin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pasha Pigface " and " Pasha Fathead , " Farouk has heeded Italian advisers and Axis promises of a " new order " of freedom . <P> The making of peace between Farouk and Nahas was a sure sign that Egyptian nationalism was rising again-timed to embarrass Britain when her hands were busy holding off an Axis invasion . The British Middle East Command , never knowing when to expect an Axis drive through Turkey and down through Syria , was weakened by the withdrawal of Australian troops to Singapore . Reported movements of new Axis troops in the Balkans and German airmen in lower Italy hinted at a big offensive if &; when Rommel plows through Cyrenaica . <P> King Farouk could n't shoot the British lion , but if Nahas Pasha helped , he could twist its tail .
