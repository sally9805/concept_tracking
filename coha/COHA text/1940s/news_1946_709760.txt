txt Less than a year after the formal end of the greatest war in history , the world has been shocked to find itself in the midst of another crisis of dangerous potentialities . Once again , as in 1914 and 1939 , the dreaded word " ultimatum " leaped out at one from the banner headlines of the press , striking fear in men 's hearts everywhere , and especially in Europe , which is still writhing under the consequences of the last war . But this time , the ultimatum was issued by the United States , and by a curious irony of fate it was directed against some of the very same forces which helped to stage both the first and the second World Wars  --  Serbian provocations and Russian ambitions of expansion . Yet there is a profound difference between then and now . In 1914 and 1939 , the ultimatums were accompanied by immediate mobilizations , and were followed by the clash of arms immediately upon their expiration . This time , instead of threatening immediate war , the American ultimatum merely put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comply with the American demands it would be haled into court ; it would be brought before the Security Council of the United Nations for appropriate action in conformity with the best judgment of the world rather than the unilateral judgment of the aggrieved nation alone . This is in itself a dramatic illustration , not only of America 's self-restraint and love of peace , but even more of the value of a world authority like the United Nations in the prevention of war . Such an authority , unfortunately , was not available in 1914 , and though it existed it was scorned by Hitler in 1939 . That an ultimatum in this new style can and does produce results is proved by the immediate release of the Americans aboard one of the downed planes , who had been in Yugoslav custody since Aug. 9 , and by the fact that Tito has issued orders to his forces not to fire on foreign planes again . This action does not comply with all the condition of the ultimatum . For the reports from Belgrade say nothing about the fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 , some of whom are believed to have been killed , but some of whom are still " missing . " The American Government will have to remain on guard against the possibility that by its partial compliance the Yugoslav Government merely attempts to blunt the impact of the American ultimatum in order to gain time . But , pending other evidence to the contrary , it may be accepted as at least an expression of Yugoslav intentions to comply in full . And if that assumption is correct , then an abatement of the immediate crisis is in sight . But even such a development can not by itself solve the deeper issues out of which the crisis arose , and which are also the justification for America 's resort to so drastic a measure as an ultimatum . One of these issues is represented by the insolent attitude of the Yugoslav Government , which turned its guns against the United States that armed and fed it  --  an attitude which found its climax in Marshal Tito 's speech in which , parroting the voice of his Moscow masters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on " certain imperialistic great Powers , " meaning the United States and Great Britain , and served notice on them that he would accept peace only on his own terms . Another and greater issue is the real intent of Russia , which stands behind Tito , and whose military , political and ideological expansion is impelling the Communist front into precipitating " incidents " against the United States all over the world in an obvious effort either to induce the United States to withdraw or so to impair its prestige that the nations will look to Russia rather than to America and Great Britain for leadership and protection . It is to be hoped that the present showdown will persuade both Russia and Yugoslavia that the United States , while patient , is neither decadent , as Hitler and the Japanese once thought , nor so innocent of the game they play as to suffer injuries through it forever . If that should , indeed , be the result , then the ultimatum will have justified itself far beyond its immediate cause , and the work of constructing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
