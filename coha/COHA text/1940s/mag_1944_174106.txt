Texas last week furnished fresh evidence of what happens to a state-university president who fails to dominate , conciliate or knuckle under to his political superiors . At a State Senate investigation of the ouster of University of Texas ' earnest , liberal President Homer P. Rainey by the politically-appointed Board of Regents ( TIME , Nov. 13 ) , Regent Orville Bullington , a rich cattle and oil man , belatedly produced what he apparently considered conclusive evidence of ex-President Rainey 's incompetence . <P> Regent Bullington : " Dr. Rainey discovered a nest of homosexuals in the faculty as early as September 1943 . He did not disclose it to any member of the board until eight months later , despite the rules requiring immediate reporting of such conditions . " <P> Senator Wardlow Lane : " You do n't mean to say that Dr. Rainey condones such things ? " <P> Regent Bullington : " No . We felt that he was not handling it vigorously enough and decided to take it over for ourselves . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
