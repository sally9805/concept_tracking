The Navy has described the torture chamber which it will build at Johnsville , Pa. to test the effect of the hops , drops and altitude changes of high-speed airplanes upon the human body . The Navy 's gadget is a gigantic merry-go-round with a cab twelve feet in diameter at the end of a 50-foot horizontal arm . When the arm is revolving 48 times a minute , the cab will circle at 173 m.p.h . At this speed everything inside it will be subjected to " a centrifugal force of 40 " Gs , " much more than the most rugged man can stand . <P> One " G " is the normal gravitational force to which the human body is accustomed . When an airplane makes a turn , it subjects its occupants to a centrifugal or " quasi-gravitational " force measured in additional Gs . During a " five G turn , " the pilot 's body weighs five times as much as normal . The Navy 's gruesome merry-go-round will determine how much a human body can weigh and still function . Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 ) , the average man blacks out at about 5 Gs . His pulled-down facial tissues make him look 20 years older ( see cut ) . <P> Pouring on the Gs . In the circling cab , the human guinea pig will be strapped in a seat mounted on gimbals , so that it can be locked in any position . The air he breathes can be pumped away to simulate altitudes up to 60,000 feet . As the Gs begin to multiply , a television tube will stare him in the face , flashing his tortured grimaces to a screen in the control room . Elaborate instruments will study his fluttering heart ; an electroencephalograph will record his troubled brain waves . An X-ray motion picture camera will photograph the slithering of his internal organs . Before his eyes , little lights will flash . In his ear a buzzer will buzz . He can put out the lights and still the buzzer by pressing the proper buttons . When he no longer can , he will be considered unconscious . <P> Human beings are not the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and radio equipment too will be threatened by mounting Gs . In preparation for military invasion of the ionosphere , the Navy 's new centrifuge will torture the robot crews of unmanned , guided missiles to see if their bloodless bodies can stand the punishment .
