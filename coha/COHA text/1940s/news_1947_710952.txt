JERUSALEM , Dec. 14 ? Palestine fighting took a new and serious turn today when troops of the Trans-Jordan Army , the Arab Legion , killed fourteen Jews and wounded nine Jews , two British soldiers , and an Arab civilian in an ' attack on a bus convoy near Tel Aviv . The attack occurred as the sevenvehicle Jewish convoy p.issed an Arab Legion camp at Beth Nabala on the Petah Tiaqva-Ben Shemen Road . The convoy had a guard of Jewish . Settlement Police . The Britons were shot as they tried to aid wounded Jews . King Abdullah 's Trans-Jordan force , trained and officered by Britons under the top command of Brig John Bagot Glubb Pasha , is noted for its discipline and units of it have been brought in by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been considered so relia6le . About 100,000 persons staged a demonstration in Cairo against the partition of Palestine . The speeches were inflammatory , but the meeting was not officially sponsored by the Arab League or its component states and there was no violence . Arab Legion Claims Defense A. Palestine Government statement on the Beth Nabala attack said the Arab troops declared they were replying to a grenade attack made on their camp by the Jewish guard of the convoy . As the hope for a decrease in tension , arising from Arab rdakb tion to the United Nations decision on partition of Palestine , seemed destroyed by the Irgun Zvai Leumi terrorist bombings of Arabs yesterday , the casualties for today totaled fifteen Jews and one Arab killed and fourteen Jews , five Arabs and three British soldiers wounded . Police announced that verified casualties from Dec. 1 until 8 a. m. // today were 190 dead , of whom eighty-four were Jews , ninetythree Arabs , six British- soldiers , . one British policeman , four Jewish settlement police and one civilian ; 174 persons seriously wounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band raided the arms store of an Arab supernumerary police unit at Ramieh . The raid netted the band 400 service rifles and 60,000 rounds of ammunition , as well as automatic weapons , but later the marauders lost most of the loot . Fleeing in three trucks , the-Arab band ran into a roadblock manned by British- Coldstream Guards , who opened fire when the first truck tried to crash through . After a half-hour battle in which a British officer was wounded , the British captured this truck but the Arabs in it escaped . The second truck was seized with seventy-seven rifles , all the automatic weapons and most of the ammunition , and three Arabs in it were captured . The third truck dot away . More Planning Seen in Outbreaks A feature of the situation is that the disorders seem to be changing in character from casual , sporadic attacks of irresponsible individuals to planned assaults aimed at killing . The Beth Nabala attack is under investigation by British authorities . The story as far as could be learned tonight was that four of the Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben Shemen , were fired on and one of the trucks was wrecked . Eight men were injured and a passing British Army truck picked them up . The British truck was fired on and its driver slightly injured , but he drove on to a hospital . Meanwhile , one of the other Jewish trucks was fired on from the Arab Legion camp . The Jewish driver lost control and this truck was wrecked . It was in this phase of the affair that thirteen Jews were killed and two seriously injured , one of whom later died . At about the same time , another British truck passing the camp was fired on and a British soldier in it was seriously wounded . An Arab civilian working nearby was hit in the head by a stray bullet . In the police investigation a grenade was found in one of the Jewish trucks and fragments of grenades of the same kind were found in the Arab Legion camp . The Jews disclaimed knowledge of . the grenade attack , alleged by men of the Arab Legion ' as their reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous reports that Arab Legionnaires took part in attacks on Jewish vehicles , but they had all been discounted : A spokesman of the Jewish Agency for Palestine said that both the Agency and British authorities believed local Arabs were using the Legion 's uniform to give the impression that Legionnaires were taking part in their attacks . The Beth Nabala incident would indicate that the tension , combined with alarm raised by the Jewish stand , has ' overridden the Legion 's discipline . The whole situation has reached a high state of confusion . Jews have been using the British police uniform to facilitate attacks . Arabs apparently have done the same . Arab auxiliary police have de-1 serted with their arms , ammuniti and uniforms  --  one of them afar shooting a Jew he was supposed to be protecting . The result is that all the armed forces are tending to be very quick on the trigger if anything looks at /all suspicious . The Beth Nabala incident adds a new element to the situation , if , as reported , the Legionnaires fired on Jewish settlement police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are Blocked A Jaffa informant reported that hope for a truce , for which leaders in Jaffa and Tel Aviv had been working , for several days , seemed lost as a result of the Saturday bomb attack on an Arab cafe in Jaffa , in which the latest report showed six killed and thirty-two injured . All roads into Jaffa were guarded by roadblocks for checking occupants of vehicles . Tension was high in Jaffa , and it was doubted whether Arab Mayor Yussuf Haikal would be able to go ahead with his talks on a truce proposal with Mayor Isaac Rokach of Tel- Aviv . Jewish Agency officials appear distressed at the Irgun terrorist attacks , which they held further complicated the situation without contributing toward any solution . " We have to fight on three fronts , " one Jewish Agency official said , " against Arab attackers , against the police disarming us and now against the Irgun terrorists . " Along the northern border , where two Lebanese Arabs accused Jews of attacking them two days ago , Lebanese frontier guards have been ordered to fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a police bulletin announced . Among various incidents during the day a Jewish settlement policeman in the Beersheba area was killed and another Jewish policeman and two other persons were wounded when they were attacked by Arabs while on their way to fetch water for the Jewish colony of Beth Ethel in the Negeb . In Jerusalem , an eighteenmonth-old Arab boy was killed and an Arab ' man was wounded by a grenade thrown at an Arab-operated bus . An Arab bus was held up by three armed Jews in the Tiberias area . As the passengers stepped out they were fired on and three Arabs were wounded . At Holon , near Tel Aviv , two Jews were wounded when shots were fired at a bus in which ' they were riding . In criticism of the British governmental and military attitude , a Jewish Agency spokesman said it was hoped the Government 's attention ( would be aroused by the Arab attack on a British Overseas Airways truck Friday near Lydda Airport . " We believe that it is the Government 's duty to safeguard such traffic to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has the capacity to do this , but is not using it . " It seems evident to observers ' that the British authorities are not exerting themselves particularly to protect road traffic . Considering there are some 50,000 British troops in an area one-fifth the size of New York State with only a few main highways , little is being done in the way of patrols .
