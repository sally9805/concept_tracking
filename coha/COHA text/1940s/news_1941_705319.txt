txt Labor Disturbances Deplored The almost daily reports of strikes in shops devoted to defense production prompt a question as to the strength of patriotic feeling among those responsible for such outbreaks . This is a time when practically every one consciously or unconsciously makes a real sacrifice for the cause of our national defense , and yet at this moment it may seem to many that advantage is taken of the urgency to question the fairness of industrial managers and cause labor difficulties . Should not such agitators be advised that the present time is not a propitious one for their activities ? It is clearly a serious matter to halt the production of needed defense material because of a difference between the unions and managers over a wage scale . Such things can not happen where there are depth and unity of popular conviction , and a sense of duty to our country at a critical moment transcends all other concern . W. E. DAVENPORT .
