The two poles of power in occupied Japan are the Dai Ichi Building , in downtown Tokyo , and the U.S. Embassy , five minutes ' drive away . General Douglas MacArthur works in the first , lives in the second . <P> SCAP ( Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers ) has 45 teams traveling through the countryside , doing the occupation 's spadework , checking on its effectiveness and on Japanese compliance . But MacArthur himself does not travel . In nearly three years of occupation he has not missed a day , including Sundays , at his desk . Douglas MacArthur , brilliant soldier and administrator , great showman , benevolent dictator , steadfast egoist , is SCAP-although the initials as usually employed refer to the whole apparatus of the occupation . <P> Last week the accomplishments of the occupation , which had seemed to go so well in its first phase , were being called in question as never before . Its aims , which had seemed so clear and simple under the Potsdam Declaration , had apparently shifted under MacArthur 's feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold Japan down ? " Now they were asking : " How are we going to hold her up ? " - meaning , how are we going to prevent economic collapse and make this floundering , bewildered country economically stable and self-sufficient ? <P> If this question caused him inner perplexity , Douglas MacArthur gave no outward sign . A new advisory commission-known as the Deconcentration Review Board-had just arrived from Washington to study part of the question for him . Their indoctrination had begun at a lunch with MacArthur himself . Now they were being crammed with facts , figures and prophecies by SCAP 's bright young men . Their job might keep them in Tokyo for months . <P> No Haste . MacArthur himself last week changed to summer uniform-a cherished one he had worn on Corregidor and on his arrival at Atsugi airdrome , in the late summer of 1945 , to take over the defeated country . He talked or worked in his office with his shirt collar unbuttoned , applying innumerable matches to one or another of his 17 pipes . <P> His day is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets up at 7 , dons a faded old West Point dressing gown ( still bearing the " A " which MacArthur , a two-letter man , won as a baseball player and football manager ) , talks to his ten-year-old son Arthur . Breakfast is a substantial and leisurely meal . When it is over , at 8:30 , he retires to his study , to work on papers brought home from the office . <P> At 10:30 a black 1941 Cadillac , with a master sergeant at the wheel , is waiting for him at the door . It rolls out the Embassy 's tree-lined driveway past two sentry boxes at which two starched G.I.s come to attention ; in the street the car is picked up by an escort of white MP jeeps . On the five-minute ride to work , MacArthur passes a sandlot where Japanese kids play baseball , a number of government buildings ( some destroyed ) , the Sakurada Gate of the Imperial Palace , the green algae-covered Imperial moat . ' For the general , the traffic lights are always green . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there are no luncheon guests , he takes a nap . At 4 he drives back to the office . He stays until 8 , 9 , sometimes 10 . Last week he never got away before 9.
