" Thurber 's colored maid Delia has figured out the mind of this foiled , circuitous wanderer . Thurber , she explains , " used to work in an office like anybody else , but he had to be sent to an institution ; he got well enough to come home from the institution , but he is still not well enough to go back to the office . " Author Thurber 's implied rejoinder is that readers who enjoy the spectacle of strait-jacketed Author Thurber should look to their own jackets . " Man , " says Thurber , " would seem to be slowly slipping back to all fours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Frost . " <P> Practically all characters in My World are mentally on all fours .

" Author Thurber learned to say : " I have left my glasses ( my watch ) ( a ring ) in the lavatory . " In moments of crisis he knew the right expressions : " Can I help you ? " " Excuse me . " " Carry on . " " Look here ! " " Look down there ! " " Look up there ! " " Why , how ? " " When , where ? " " Because . " " That 's it !
