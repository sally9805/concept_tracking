In the far north , army officers figure that for every degree the temperature drops below zero , a soldier 's effectiveness goes down about 2% . Near 50 below , all his energy is used just to stay alive . But if the Western Hemisphere ever has to defend itself against an attack launched over the Pole , Western man must learn ( as his enemy will presumably have learned ) how to survive in Arctic weather , and still have energy left to fight . How to acquire that skill is the problem before the Joint U.S.Canadian Cold Weather Testing Station at Churchill . <P> Although Churchill is 550 miles south of the Arctic Circle , and its temperature rarely drops lower than 40 below zero F. , it is an ideal spot for pitting men and machines against the cold . Located where the tree line meets Hudson Bay , it offers both timberland and tundra . And what it lacks in low temperatures is more than made up by its high winds . <P> The Meaning of Wind . Back in Ottawa last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Claxton told how the 850 military men ( 500 Canadian , 350 U.S. ) were meeting the challenge of cold . <P> It 's the " wind chill , " Claxton had learned , as much as the cold , that gets men down in the north . On a scale worked out by Dr. Paul Siple ( Eagle Scout of the Byrd 1928 expedition ) , flesh freezes at a wind chill of 1,400 . This may be at 20 above zero , if there is a 20-mile wind , or 40 below with a one-mile wind . Last winter , survivors told Claxton , Churchill 's wind chill was greater than 1,400 most of the time , and once hit 2,370 . <P> Soldiers in the north must be armored against wind chill . For centuries , Eskimos have conquered cold with caribou skins , but there are n't enough caribou to uniform an army . White men have tried piling on layers of clothing , which keep out cold but keep in sweat-and if the sweat freezes , so does the man . Churchill 's commanding officer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Look for Arctic infantrymen . <P> The experimental uniforms , of which 150 have been tested , work on the " vapor barrier principle . " A netlike string vest is worn next to the skin . Over it are parkas of mohair and rubberized nylon , with drawstrings to regulate the air flow . Thus clad , white men can stand a wind chill of 1,400 as well as an Eskimo . <P> No Problem of Cold . Ex-Gunner Claxton also inspected artillery pieces which had been fired successfully in Churchill 's cold , then stored for the rest of the winter by " cocooning " them with a plastic sprayed over canvas . They had come through in good shape . But artillerymen still have their troubles . Braking spades on gun carriages snap off on the first recoil ; in extreme cold some explosives become unstable and are either dangerous to handle or hard to fire . Americans and Canadians , working in parallel experiments , are still trying to figure the best way to keep engine oils fluid . <P> Even if all the machines ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inefficient . A rifle will fire , but it takes a man to aim it and press the trigger-and a man wearing four layers of mittens has no trigger finger . Neither can he work small knobs on radio or radar sets .
