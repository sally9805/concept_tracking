Heart of a City ( by Lesley Storm ; produced by Gilbert Miller ) . The only London theater that has never shut down , come blitz or blackout , is the tiny Windmill with its breezy nonstop revue . In Heart of a City English Playwright Storm has pictured backstage life at the Windmill while the bombs are falling outside . Lovely and lightly clad showgirls duck in &; out of dressing rooms , rehearse , have their fun , lose their hearts , stifle their fears . The play is a tribute to two kinds of grit , " There 'll Always Be An England " weaving in with " The Show Must Go On . " <P> Heart of a City is a teacup version of The Wookey , with more sugar in it than tea . At times it is touching , at other times amusing ( there is plenty of good old British ragging to tone down its heroics ) ; but lacking imagination and any real eye for character , Playwright Storm can write only with a kind of mild , admiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play . Heart of a City is almost entirely atmosphere , and all its scenes are pretty much alike . Hence each scene is less effective than the one before it , and by curtain time the Windmill has ceased to turn .
