A NICE MAN A STORY BY GRACE FLANDRAU Tr was not when he began to drink so I steadily and with so little apparent enjoyment  --  although that too surprised me  --  that I first noticed this man . My attention had already been drawn to him on the station platform , partly because I felt sure I had seen him before and partly because he looked so extraordinarily  --  nice . No other word so exactly expresses it as nice . Among the many dingy or vulgar or sinister persons one sees in a crowd he had stood out pleasing and in some way reassuring . Everything about him was so exactly right  --  the soft gray homespun he wore , the quiet , honest , gentlemanly expression of his face , and especially the unobtrusive dignity with which he carried himself . During the drive across the city from one station to the other I had felt vaguely and absurdly guilty . There was no real reason why I should not have stopped over and spent at least one night in Lake Forest with my sister-in-law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not want to . I knew she would be offended because I had n't . Not because she was so devoted to me , but because she felt so strongly about all conventional gestures however meaningless . And it was with equally absurd relief that I saw the cement arches of the platform begin to glide slowly past the windows and felt the heavy train roll smooth as oil out into the sunshine . My Pullman was excessively air-cooled and , hoping to find a more temperateclimate , I went into the club car . But the same dour windy chill was everywhere . So I gave up , put on a heavy coat , and settled down . Only three persons were there beside myself , a smart , tweedy , surprisingly ugly woman with eyes slightly crossed like a Siamese cat 's , a thick young man with thick octagonal glasses , and the nice-looking person I had already noticed . He had taken the chair opposite mine and he did not , like the rest of us , reach for a newspaper . He did not look out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did he stare portentously into space . If he was absorbed in any particular reflections he did not betray it . He merely , for a time , sat very still . Then , suddenly , he beckoned to the barman . When the tall glass half filled with ice , the tiny carafe of whiskey , the split of soda were set before him he mixed the drink and downed it , I thought , rather quickly . The feeling of having seen him before persisted . And there was also the sensation in my mind of a whole group of other associations I could not quite bring into my consciousness . His face was ruddy , rather broad , with a good chin and forehead , and he looked a year or two less than forty . Only his mouth puzzled me at first . To say thin-lipped is to suggest meanness , and there was conspicuously no meanness there . Rather , it was as if some long repression had drawn in his lips until his mouth was only a sensitive , guarded line that withheld all information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more concerned with this stranger than with the news that I had already seen in the morning papers , heard on the radio , and that was n't news anyhow but only surmise . The empty whiskey carafe had been removed and a full one immediately set before him . It seemed a little early for chain drinking , nor was dissipation in keeping with whatever it was I seemed to know and not quite remember about this man . He drank his second highball in the same quick , unenthusiastic way and allowed a slight interval to elapse before he ordered a third . In this interval the smart woman with the Siamese-cat eyes left the car and the thick young man opened a thick red hook and became lost in the mass of fine pages gray with figures and algebraic formulae . The man across from me had finished his third drink and ordered a fourth . Then he put on a pair of rimless spectacles  --  they strongly emphasized the kindly , respectable quality of his appearance  --  took a fountain pen from his pocket , and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of the train had been brought to him and he wrote steadily and quietly with his clean , free-flowing pen . All at once a phrase , spoken in my sister-in-law 's insistent drawl , came back to me . " Now , take the Butterworths ? " this was the way Katherine always began one of the endless rigmaroles she liked to carry on about people ? " it 's simply wonderful what Mary Butterworth has done for that man . " We were sitting , the three of us ( there was another woman , but somehow she did n't count ) in the back seat of Katherine 's car . We must have been in evening dress and rather crowded , because I could smell not only the perfume and sachet but even the faint dye smell of the satins and chiffons , could feel the rustling silkiness about me and the brush of Katherine 's ermines against my bareann . The night air streamed cool through the slightly lowered pane and the highway lay straight and white as bone in the moonlight . The Butterworths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man I had at last identified . But what was the other name ? Not Charles , but a name that is like that  --  the way George is , or Thomas . Details too , of the house , the dinner party , of Mary Butterworth came back to me . Everything , indeed , I remembered better than I did the host , Frank Butterworth  --  the name Frank spoke itself  --  who now sat drinking one whiskey after another , writing one page after another only to tear it up and begin again . It had been during my last visit to Katherine about two years before . And I recalled what a great point she had made of that dinner at the Butterworths ' . " You must see the house  --  they 've just finished it and it could n't be more attractive . Of course it is a little far out for Frank to motor back and forth every day , and it is pretty big , a regular show place , and Frank is n't really a rich man . But it 's wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she can do anything . Why , nobody ever heard of Frank Butterworth , at least not the people one wants to know , until she married him . And now look at them ! " She told me  --  admiringly  --  how Mary had contrived to meet such and such a woman , to get asked to such and such a house , to put this or that " couple " into her debt . ( Katherine sees all human beings as " couples " or " extra " men and women available for formal entertainments , just as she sees all landscapes as settings for a country house , or all art objects as ornaments for a drawingroom . ) I remembered too that when we turned from the county road into the Butterworths ' private drive I thought Mary must indeed be a good manager . It wound sumptuously between newly planted shrubs and evergreens , past tennis courts , kennels , kitchen gardens , and a picking garden where the rich col-ors of the zinnias burned like fire in the gray dusk . The rambling house glowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the broken , not quite human , din of human voices outscreaming one another in party talk and laughter . A dozen men and women were on the flagged terrace in the front and from there you saw for the first time the little round lake , dropped like a silver dollar at the foot of the sloping lawn . The woods about it were in deep shadow , but above and beyond , high rolling fields lay wide and tranquil and still bright from the sunset afterglow . Then our hostess swept toward us , was sending up skyrocket bursts of words that drifted down again , twinkling and too easily extinguished . The sheer , crisp , pale yellow she wore set off her ash-blond hair , and her pale skin that was almost childlike in its perfect fairness . I remembered thinking that as a young girl she must have been very disarming in appearance . But now there was something a little hawklike and predatory in her appearance . Her fine aquiline nose pointed down ever so slightly to the determined chin that lifted toward it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bright smiling eyes were restless and glancing . They peered now into mine , with that brilliant , unrelated smile , then swept in swift estimate over my whole person . The flow of her terribly vivacious chatter went on undisturbed . " Katherine , darling , you must rescue us . O.T . is being simply wonderful , but we 're out over our heads and I 'm going down for the third time with my lungs full of Relativity . Do think of some scandal or a dirty story or anything , to bring us back at least into the first four dimensions . " She laughed over her shoulder toward the little group she had left and murmured : " O'Toole  --  Aloysius the  --  you know ? " But here the thread of my recollections was broken . When , for instance , did I meet my host ? And surely I had never talked to him , either during cocktails orafter dinner . I remembered nothing except the way the long luxurious table , glittering in candlelight , fragrant with white flowers , stretched off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose at the far end . I looked at him now across the club car . A good many torn sheets of paper lay beside him and he still wrote seriously and without haste . Frank Butterworth . And of course he had no recollection of me . She may even have forgotten to present us , so occupied she had been in dominating the party , showering it with her bursts of talk that twinkled like those Fourth of July sparklers that give no heat and such a very evanescent light . But other impressions of her too must have been forming during that evening . Especially there was a sudden glimpse of her face in the soft , uneven , upward thrust of the candlelight . In that ma-meat I saw a different woman altogether . She was n't talking or , it seemed , even listening . She was like a swimmer who , in the last extremity of fatigue , floats for a moment , inert , and as it were indifferent . For an instant I stared , oblivious of the party ritual about us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman perhaps who remembered , among the many successes , the inevitable defeats , the few and deep humiliations . Who longed , it might be , for the strength to give up , to abandon the ladder on which it is so easy to slip and the top of which it is the damnation of most climbers never to feel quite sure of having reached . . . . At any rate , I remembered how on the way home I interrupted Katherine 's monologue about the Butterworths to exclaim : " But of course , she is unhappy too . " Now , thinking of the way I phrased it , I saw that I must have felt that his unhappiness was well known , and that I alone had discovered hers . But Katherine , astonished and shocked , declared I was entirely wrong about them both . He had at last finished his letter . It covered all four pages of the double sheet . Beside him a fifth or perhaps a sixth highball glass stood empty . Attentively he read the letter , folded it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain billfold he took an airmail stamp and pasted it on . But he did not hand the letter to the porter to mail . Instead , after hesitating a moment , he put it into his vest pocket . The discarded pages he tore into smaller pieces and crushed in his hand . But even so , he seemed not to trust the waste basket but thrust the fragments into his jacket pocket . Soon after he went out of the car . Why , now that he had , with the aid of a good deal of whiskey , got whatever it was off his chest , had n't he left the letter to be sent from the next station ? Or did I merely imagine that the highballs and the letter had something to do with each other ? And would he go on drinking like that now that it was done ? I felt rather relieved to discover that he did not . When I went back to my car I saw him in the room across from mine . His door was open and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no drink before him . He did not go into the dining car for dinner and when I came back from there , he was still quietly reading . I opened a magazine , more concerned with this man 's affairs which were certainly no affair of mine , than with what I read . Then a sudden movement across the aisle caught my eye . He had closed the book , dropped it on the seat beside him . In the same brusque way he took the letter out of his vest pocket . His face , I saw , was no longer ruddy . It was quite pale and the receding effects of the alcohol left it strained and tired and older than he could possibly he . And for the first time , through its impassivity , an emotion showed , a look of almost desperate defeat . He held the letter for a moment in his hand and then , without opening it , he tore it into little pieces , crushed these , as he had the others , in his hand and put them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the windows . I suppose people have a kind of sixth sense about the things that mean the most to them . Katherine Pierce , at least , seems to have . And as conventional gestures are the mainspring of her life , she soon nosed out the fact that I had in this respect transgressed . I had passed through Chicago without letting her know . A slightly offended letter reached me a fortnight or so later and by way of punishment she let me know all I had missed by not stopping off . Lake Forest had never been so full of " interesting " people . Everybody was entertaining and the Butterworths were giving one of their big dinners that week . She hoped , incidentally , that this would put an end to the foolish rumors about them ? rumors that he was going to leave her , that he was worried about money , that there was someone he cared for in the East  --  some mousy , insignificant girl nobody had ever heard of . Katherine was glad she 'd always had the sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been right . For here they were , together , and giving a dinner for the , British Commission . Giving a dinner . I put down the letter . It would be just such a party , on just such a summer night as I remembered . Pale frocks , white dinner coats , flowers burning in dusk , the house bright as a jack-o ' - lantern under the dark trees . And far away beyond the lake , the high fields  --  wide and tranquil and still touched by a light from the bright west . Outside , in the smooth gray light of evening , her delicately predatory face would be hawklike and triumphant . But later , something perhaps would happen . The soft , flawed candlelight would find new lines , and there might be seen , elusive as the overtone of a note of music , the shadow of that other woman  --  driven and helpless and uniquely sad . So then I understood . He ' too had seen her . Very likely he had met her face to face in the bitter moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really , all she had . And so being such a nice man , there was nothing whatever he could do .
