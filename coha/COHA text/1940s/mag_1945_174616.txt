The Allied world waited for the two most spectacular military events of 1945 : the fall of Berlin , and the meeting of U.S. <P> and Russian armies in central Germany . <P> Marshal Zhukov 's First White Russian Army smashed into Berlin last week ( see below ) . The Paris radio blabbed that the U.S. and Red Army patrols had already made contact near Dresden . <P> At SHAEF , however , the Supreme Commander 's hard-working chief of staff , Lieut . General Walter Bedell ( " Beedle " ) Smith , made it clear that the official U S. - Russian junction would not be a haphazard patrol contact , and that it would not be casually reported . The time and place had been agreed on : the announcement would be a joint fanfare from Washington , London and Moscow . <P> U.S. troops on the Elbe-Mulde river lines were waiting too , and although the pause improved their supply situation , perhaps the main reason they waited went all the way back to Yalta . For the moment , the Russians were advancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile , the Yanks were coached in Soviet tank recognition and taught a few words of greeting in Russian . Artillery commanders were warned not to fire any farther than they could see . <P> This week Marshal Stalin announced that Red Army units had reached the Elbe at Mhlberg - 30 miles northwest of Dresden and almost due east of Leipzig . Technically this was not a junction , since the U.S. positions on the Elbe were farther north . But at least the two Allies had reached the banks of the same river . <P> After the real junction , the Russians and the western Allies would have need of closer tactical coordination than ever before , because they would then be fighting side by side against the main German pockets in the north and south . Whether or not Yalta foresaw that situation , it will take some straightening out . <P> On the southeastern front , Marshal Malinovsky was gathering momentum for a push into Bohemia , and south of Bohemia Marshal Tolbukhin was thrusting along the Danube toward Linz . If Tolbukhin can meet the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Linz and Regensburg , then Bohemia ( and the war industries of Prague and Pilsen ) will be cut off from the Nazis ' Alpine bastion . <P> In Italy , the heaviest Allied offensive of 1945 won Bologna , the great German bolt position guarding the Poplain ( see below ) . There now seemed no hope for the Nazis to hold anywhere short of the Alps . <P> It only remained to be seen how many of their divisions in Italy they could pull back to the mountain bastion under the scourge of Allied air power .
