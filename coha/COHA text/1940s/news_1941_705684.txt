txt State Guard Offers Opportunities In a letter to THE TIMES Donald Barry expresses his desire to take an ' active part in the military defense pro- ' gram , being ineligible for the regular , enlisted services . The New York Guard is actively op- : erating for just such men as he . All he needs do is call New York Guard Headquarters , 80 Center Street , Manhattan , to get information about the regiment stationed in a Brooklyn armory near his home . The members of the New York Guard . are neither amateurs nor playboys . The officers are men with long military experience in the last war , the National Guard and the Reserve Corps . The enlisted personnel is largely coin .. posed of young men who join to acquire experience that will prove useful if they , are drafted . Still others are in the same case as Mr. Barry , and there is a liberal sprinkling of enlisted men over age for the Regular Army who served as privates , corporals and sergeants in the World War . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these men are , voluntarily and without pay , giving to their State and country , the ignorance of the public about the Guard is a constant source of dismayed astonishment . Few seem to realize that the New York Guard is the State 's first line of miliv tary defense , just as the New York Na. ' tional Guard was before induction into Federal service . ?
