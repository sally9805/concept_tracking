Mightier democracies continued pussyfooting on post-war plans , but last week the squareheaded Dutch went on record . Their good Queen Wilhelmina flatly rejected Empire , plunked for Commonwealth . <P> Over London 's Radio Orange , solid Dutch Democrat Wilhelmina told her people and the world : <P> &gt;The Netherlands , The Netherlands Indies , Curasao and Surinam , after victory , would form a commonwealth whose four parts would have independence at home , but be united " in readiness to render mutual assistance . " <P> &gt;A conference of all her peoples to discuss and create such a commonwealth was , in fact , about to be held when war came ; and now " we can only resume these preparations when everyone will be able to speak his mind freely . " <P> To the Atlantic Charter Wilhelmina thus gave bone , meat , flavor . The new commonwealth , said she , " will leave no room for discrimination according to race or nationality . Only the ability of the individual citizens and the needs of the various groups of the population will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that no political unit nor national cohesion can continue to exist which is not supported by the voluntary acceptance and the faith of the great majority of the citizenry.
