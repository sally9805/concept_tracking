Two startling methods of shocking lunatics back to sanity were discussed by doctors at the American Psychiatric Association meeting in Richmond , Va . last week . Both types of treatment are mechanical , differ from chemical injections of insulin or metrazol , which are widely used in hospitals throughout the U.S. <P> Electric Current . Four years ago , two doctors in Rome named Ugo Cerletti and L. Bini passed an electric current through a dog 's brain , gave him a mild convulsion without doing him any harm . They next attempted to faradize psychiatric patients back to normality . Dr. Lothar Kalinowsky of Berlin introduced the new technique to Paris and London , is now working in Manhattan 's New York State Psychiatric Institute . <P> A patient with schizophrenia or manic-depressive psychosis ( alternating fits of madness and despair ) is placed on his back on a table . Two electrodes on a forceps-like spring are set firmly on his temples . <P> The electrodes are pads of soft rubber sponge covered with interlacing bands of thin copper strip , and are attached to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 70 to 100 volts is passed from one side of the patient 's head to the other for about one-tenth of a second . <P> As soon as the electric circuit is closed , the patient becomes unconscious . Then his limbs begin to twitch and he falls into a fit closely resembling epilepsy . In a few minutes he awakens , with no recollection of the convulsion . Treatments are given about three times a week , for several weeks . <P> So far , over 10,000 convulsions have been given to patients abroad and in the U.S. The proportion of improvement depends upon the type and length of illness , is about the same as for insulin and metrazol-estimates range roughly from IS to 50% . But of course psychiatrists do not yet know how permanent any shock treatment is over a period of years . <P> Although electric shock may not replace the standard insulin treatment , most psychiatrists think it far superior to metrazol . Its advantages : 1 ) the convulsions are not usually as violent as those produced by metrazol ; 2 ) since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightening " aura " that precedes a metrazol convulsion ; 3 ) electric treatment is much cheaper than insulin or metrazol-a machine costs less than $300 . But electric shock is safe only in the hands of a trained psychiatrist . <P> Famed Psychiatrist Abraham Myerson of Boston declared last week that he successfully used electric shocks for 40 cases of early depression . Dr. Lauren Howe Smith and colleagues of Philadelphia 's Pennsylvania Hospital claimed that electric shock calmed noisy patients in the wards cut their length of stay in half .
