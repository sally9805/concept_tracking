Ohio 's Robert Taft had been telling his fellow Republicans lately that unless they plugged for social-welfare legislation the Republican Party was doomed . Last week in the U.S. Senate , Robert Taft gave a vigorous demonstration of what he was preaching . Batting down the opposition of Democrats and Republicans alike , Ohio 's Taft , almost singlehanded , hammered through a $300 million bill to help the nation 's schoolchildren . <P> Virginia 's self-appointed treasury-guard , Democrat Harry F. Byrd , nagged Taft with quotes from Taft 's own statements opposing a similar bill in 1943 . Taft frankly said that he had been converted , that he had come to realize that some states could not afford adequate educational standards . Said he : " I do not think we should . . . refuse to give one cent for this purpose , merely because perhaps some day we shall be asked to give more . " <P> Behind Taft 's leadership , the Senate beat back an attempt , by Massachusetts ' Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. , to tack on an anti-segregation provision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An effort of Missouri 's Republican Forrest Donnell to bar Roman Catholic schools from even indirect help collapsed , and so did one by Connecticut 's Democrat Brien McMahon to require such indirect help . Such questions were left , as Taft had insisted they should be , to the states . In the end , the Senate passed the bill 58 to 15 . <P> It would provide $5 for each school-age child ( 5 to 17 ) in every state , plus additional funds on a sliding scale for the poorer states , e.g. , Mississippi would get the highest allotment , $29.18 for each child . The states could use the funds for any grade-or high-school purpose , including building improvements or teachers ' salaries . Last year Republican leadership in the House killed a similar Senate bill . But if the House Republicans were listening to Taft , the measure would have a lot less trouble this time .
