REPORT OF DEATH KNELL A Story HUGO JOHANSON U NDOUBTEDLY Rolf Wachencrantz was a great rogue . He had hoodwinked ninety thousand shareholders , and had long since left Europe for endless foreign adventure of uncertain repute . But to his niece and nephews  --  the three children of his only sister , Laura , who had married Herr Oscar Lundmark  --  he was a creature of enchanting legend . They had never seen Rolf Wachencrantz . He had left the country many years before they were born ; and though he was heard from now and again in some tantalizing manner , he never wrote to his old parents , his sister , or anybody else at the Sund . But the Lundmark children could n't have enough of his story . Remoteness made him miraculous . They were a conjectural lot , these children . From Svea , the oldest and going on eleven , the most was expected , for although not brilliant she was clever enough to be a pattern of conduct when it paid off to be one , and although common of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the handsome and contrariwise in-between , the worst was expected ; his father 's rod and cane had quite failed to subdue him . What Inge , the youngest , would come to was pure guesswork . Inge was six years old , and mousy for his years . At long intervals he went off his quiet tangent and was seized by convulsions , ending up in a hemorrhage . ThiS " falling sickness " ( it responded after afashion to cold water by the dipperful ) coincided with ludicrous incidents : for instance , once it struck while he was offered ever so nicely at the table the tasty pope 's nose of the speckled hen he had been wont to lead on a string ; another time it overtook him when he found his Eulenspiegel book spread-eagled on the tract hook in the privy . He befriended earthworms and suchlike , and he kicked grownups in the shins when they picked wildflowers or otherwise raped nature . A habitual beckoner at nothing tangible with his thin hands , and a whisperer to nothing more of a listener than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between sheer fantasy and bedecked reality . One of his many halfway-houses was the curing pantry , where for hours at a time he sat and hummed the Kingly Anthem in a throne he had built for himself of small , mellowing goat cheeses . Whatever the cause  --  his unavoidable odor or his babyish aura  --  the boy was fetching to servant girls ruled by their appetites . Intellectual women preferred to discuss him knowingly . One governess ( the one with the actual Ph.D . and the fancied Oedipus complex ) spoke of him as " the little byproduct . " Growing weary from edifying mummies , she overreached herself and said that the Lundmark family seemed so complete when the youngest was in hiding that he must have been begotten between parentheses instead of between sheets . " Peeping Tom ! " shouted Herr Lundmark , discharging her on the spot . Rolf Wachencrantz , the faraway uncle , the creature of legend , was the invisible cord which held the three disparate siblings together . Svea and Stig doted on their small brother Inge because , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rolf Wachencrantz ; Inge loved them , mostly because he did n't know better , partly because they subscribed to his daydreams . Inge gathered the frayed straw-man of rumors , whisked him free of adult ugliness , and paraded him anew with childish pomp and innocent circumstance . When Svea and Stig wormed out of their mother the unbearable secret that Rolf Wachencrantz was a " capitalist " by profession , Inge changed the term to " speculator " ? which to them was a promotion . For practicing capitalists sat on folding money and silverware , but performing speculators were really interesting  --  they juggled other people 's gold coins . It was Inge who upset the strict family etiquette by taking to speaking of Rolf Wachencrantz as " Rolf " instead of " Morbror " ( mother 's brother ) . He sensed early that Rolf 's many-sided infamy was exhilarating and grandly elevated from the base level of ordinary relations . Ordinary kinsmen bored the children with their patting and kissing and condescending remarks , but Rolf  --  a hearsay ennobled with moral turpitude  --  was another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived one Easter , addressed to " THE SUNDLINGS , THE SUND , " and reading , " SHORT LONG FRIDAY TO YOU STOP . " The unsigned message came from Sao Joao do Principe , Brazil . Long Friday at the Sund fell at the height of the thaw and calving season , and slush and rennet pudding and admonitions were all the children ordinarily got out of that solemn , everlasting holiday . But was the opportune cheer aimed at them , had Rolf really sent it , and what did the " sroP " mean ? Stumped , the two oldest went to the youngest for guidance . He told them that Rolf had sent the telegram all right ; Roll ' operated in heathendom and never committed himself in writing . As for " THE SUNDLINGS , " it was hog Latin for " piglings , " or tender Sund people ; and the " STOP " alluded to the rennet pudding  --  no more of it . The translation satisfied Svea and Stig no end . What Inge did n't know positively , he could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was in close touch with Rolf 's mother , who of course was their maternal grandmother . Inge was the only one of her grandchildren Fru Wachencrantz could stomach . T HE old Wachencrantz couple lived upstairs at the Sund . In his youth , the well-born Herr Louis Wachencrantz had traveled and quarreled extensively in foreign lands , broadening his mind when not preparing himself for the diplomatic service . Thrice he had attained the rank of consular agent 's clerk , and as many times his superiors had thought the better of it and advanced him to the drudgery of the Home Office . Irked by the slow tempo peculiar to diplomacy , he had turned to commercial exploration . He had succeeded at least in finding a wife able to support him . " Peruvian bark treed him , Abyssinian papyrus swamped him , Turkish yogurt soured him , and I salvaged him , " Fru Wachencrantz once explained when asked about the romantic events which had led to their marriage . At eighty , Herr Wachencrantz ' sight and hearing seemed to be better than ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nape ; his arms were lame , however , and he walked with difficulty . Every morning after breakfast , Fru Wachencrantz put him in a deep armchair next to the window , stuck a good cigar in his mouth , and spread the latest Figaro before him on the table . After five minutes the cigar had gone out , the scandal sheet was forgotten , and Herr Wachencrantz was staring intently through the window . At dusk he still peered out , a bit more eagerly if anything ; when it turned coal dark he closed his eyes and sat upright , listening hard , quivering with suspense , until forcefully led off to bed . He was above speaking , at any rate civilly . Nobody blamed Herr Wachencrantz for not behaving altogether rationally . In addition to being thwarted and maimed , he came of an illustrious lineage which had n't produced a doer in generations . There were times though when Fru Wachencrantz could n't handle him herself and had to call in Petronella , the fowl woman . A shapeless spinster , hovering by nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week in April and the first in September , she enjoyed paid vacations  --  that is , she sat next to Herr Wachencrantz , practically in his lap , and knitted socks , the while keeping on the alert . At the first sound of the haunting come-along ! come-along ! of migrating birds , she jumped up , threw herself around Herr Wachencrantz ' neck , and cried , " Fru Wachencrantz , they are honking around the bend ! " Fru Wachencrantz would drop whatever she might be doing and join Petronella . Bearing down upon the straining little old fellow with their combined poundage , the two solid women prevented him from throwing himself against the window in his endeavors to join the trident-shaped formation above in its great seasonal flight , in the spring to the tarns of Lapland , in the fall to the headwaters of the Nile . As soon as the aerial summoning began to fade , the danger was over ; earthed and wing-clipped , Louis Wachencrantz was released to sob in despair . F RU WACHENCRANTZ took her husband 's failings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Men and monuments will crack ? they have n't a woman 's bodily padding to fall back upon when pushed over she said . Hard usage , middling dissipation , and no consideration for the consequences , had added corpulence to her tallness , sting to her speech , and a weakness for rendering to Satan the things that were Satan 's . Born out of wedlock and therefore of kin to nobody and unencumbered , she had struck out for herself at an early age with a modiste 's thimble in her apron pocket . She had made better than a competence designing hats , had invested and nearly lost it in the Sund , and then , curbed by the years , had turned the entire property over to her daughter and son-in-law and sat back to remind those who addressedher as " Fru Retired Estate Owner " that she had merely reverted to her original status of penniless bastard . It was whispered locally that she swilled Oporto , gulped French paperbacks , chewed her husband 's neglected cigars , spat out blasphemies , and inhaled with gusto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she fell prey to the most telling symptom of senility  --  audible thinking . Fru Wachencrantz did n't mind being overheard by good listeners but she detested inquisitive brats ; that was the chief reason why her doors were closed to Svea and Stig . She was n't certain how and when Inge got into her rooms ; he appeared now and then , and there was little she could do about it even if she had wanted to . Sometimes when she was gambling for coppers with herself and swearing at the cards , she became aware of a child 's hands gripping the edge of the card table . Raising her eyes she noticed that Inge 's lips were busy at work emulating her pungencies . Though it did n't matter much ( the child was all soul and could be trusted to swear with it ) , Fru Wachencrantz pruned her language a trifle and invited him to stay . In the early hours of Sunday mornings , while she was flailing at the knickknacks in her salon with a peacock feather duster , Fru Wachencrantz often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were chosen from two schools : the violent and the peaceful . The raging torrent , the overwhelming cataract , the blizzard on the plains , the thunderstorm in the mountains , the tossed hulk , and the charging lancers , along with the tree stumps , broken barrels , and bloated corpses that go with upheavals , were as often and as painstakingly represented as were the sunlit dell , the moon-washed mesa , the munching herd , the joyful harvest . The disciples of Gericault and Meissonier had no warmer admirer and readier weeper than Inge Sitting astride a three-legged tabouret , upholstered with yellow silk , he propelled himself , mentally and physically , from bliss to tumult to disaster . Fru Wachencrantz disapproved of rough handling and emotional sprees in her salon ; and she saved both boy and tabouret from going to pieces by promising him sounder fare if he would dismount and come and see what was new in the love seat . " What was new " was usually a recent clipping from a Continental newspaper  --  Le or one of the leading German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clippings were sent to his mother by a news bureau she subscribed to . The love seat had been a powder cask during the Thirty Years War ; after it had been cut down to a barrel chair for two , its combustive reek had ignited the passions of many a groping couple . Himself excepted , Herr Wachencrantz had contributed nothing to the home but this cavernous , oaken , and copper-bound malformation . The seat proper was the old cask head , which when lifted disclosed a receptacle filled with tokens of Fru Wachencrantz ' first-born . But in it were no toddler 's shoes or beribboned tam ; nothing in the exotic accumulation dated back more than a quarter of a century  --  to the year Rolf had gone abroad and cut himself off in a manner from the family . Kneeling before the love seat and beating time with the feather duster , Fru Wachencrantz would first read a clipping about Rolf in melodramatic French or seriocomic German and then sum it up in buffoon Sund dialect . Inge would stand beside her , lapping up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad tidings of the native finale . Once the latter had been , " Rolf is up to his nose in guano now " ; another time , " Rolf seems to have pawned off that gravel pit of his for a Matto Grosso iron mine " ; and still another time , " Rolf 's gutta-percha bubble is on the rebound . " O NCE in a long while , the love seat yielded more substantial evidence of Rolf . As if determined to keep intact the cloud he had left the Sund under , he sometimes ordered a curio dealer or a luxury shop to wrap up a bizarre memento and ship it anonymously to the Sund . At Christmas , it might be a bright tropical oddity , suitable to enhance the murk of the winter solstice that the Sund people dwelt in ; near the time of an oldster 's birthday , it might be an ornament , the costliness and warped design of which would remind the celebrant of the futility of worldly goods and the frailty of man . Anything bearing the laconic address " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so much because she typified the Sund but because , being the perpetrator of Rolf so to speak , she ought to bear the brunt of his output . Over the course of the years , Fru Wachencrantz had received so many odd things from so many improbable places that , the sense of novelty having faded , she now put foreign-stamped and toll-marked mail in the love seat , to be left unopened until Inge happened to be present . A tolerable grandmother , she got more fun from watching the boy , half beside himself from anticipation and chafing underwear , cutting the strings of a parcel , insured for a preposterous sum of money , than from trying on the filigreed , sabre-toothed necklace of gold that it contained ; and , an adventuress at heart , she joined him in sampling vivid-labeled canisters , the while thinking aloud that xarque and mate were not a whit better than jerky and Paraguay tea . In addition to letting it be known that he remembered the Sund , Rolf also insinuated that he wished to be remembered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the love seat with an unsolicited photograph of himself . When Inge suggested that the mounting collection of pictures ought to be preserved in an album , Fru Wachencrantz went and fetched Bunyan 's Life and Death of Mr. Badman , a hitherto idle tome at the Sund , and put it to use . Together they tore out all the pages except those with illustrations on them ; then they pasted Rolf on Mr. Badman . The redecoration was all that was needed to make Bunyan wonderful to Inge . Printed in needle-sharp focus on steely platinum paper , Senhor Wachencrantz towered on horseback at the head of a mule train winding its unerring way across an unmapped campo ; or lolled in a hamaca slung among lianas and pythons in a miasmal clearing ; or clinked glasses with khakied pathfinders and dusterclad promoters outside an adobe tavern ; or even popularized manual labor by washing pure gold from an Amazonian tributary . One of the pictures was a poor likeness of Rolf , perhaps a counterfeit , Inge thought . If one could believe it , Rolf was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linen suit , who sat in moody contemplation on a terrace beside a ferny ravine and a listless sea . Nothing lessened the dreariness of the vista unless it was the person 's hands , holding out a stock certificate ( de Wachencrantz Inter-bourse Preferential ) as if floating it . Every time Fru Wachencrantz ran across that particular Mr. Badman entry , she regretted her love life . The streak of merciless honesty in her prompted her to tell Inge he was a whittled-down replica of Rolf ; an inkling of pity for the undeservedly tainted forbade her to hint that the child 's mouth was weak no matter how pretty , his eyes small no matter how dreamy , his hands restless no matter how charming , his nose a Wachencrantz hallmark ( a defiant ridge ending in a vague knob ) no matter how childish just now . Unable to disentangle her simple-hearted grandson from her double-dealing son , Fru Wachencrantz hoisted herself up from the floor , leaving Inge to turn the pages . The foreign views transported him , and he became a towering , spurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat . F kV WACHENCRANTZ entertained on a modest scale . She was at home in her kitchen every Tuesday at three o'clock to Petronella and herself . If on these occasions the down-draft somehow wafted the cooking odors downstairs and Inge upstairs , his presence was blinked at . In the hallway he picked up Papagaio , the house bird , who lived on a crucifix made of two broom handles . The occasion was given over to eel in paper ; tiny , spiced meat balls saut  --  ed in butter ; boiled potatoes , black bread dunked in the eel drippings ; plum comp8te , and Oporto . Fru Wachencrantz drank the Oporto from a gilded and enameled beaker , Petronella from a pewter mug , Papagaio from an egg cup , and Inge from an eye cup . Since the hostess delighted in truly homey touches , any little mishap at the table was a godsend most apropos , a re-minder of bygone follies and lapses , and an invitation to take the skeletons out of the family closet for a rattling ; and since she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ears . They did n't hurry her , just let fortuitous events occur . Inge never knew that Papagaio , the parrot , was a retired Nemesis until the day when the bird overindulged and fell off his crucifix into Fru Wachencrantz ' lap , where his thrashing about to the tune of lewd words brought to her mind Rolf 's tantrums when crossed in love . It seemed that in his early twenties , while professing attendance at the Royal Institute of Mining , Rolf had sought in liaison a pretty hussy named Dorcas . She was exacting ; she told him to his face that in her station of life one stood off the pinch-fisted and unbent to the full-handed . Within a year Rolf had managed to borrow and spend so much money on Dorcas that Fru Wachencrantz had recalled him to the Sund and given him the choice of stepping into a pair of old-fashioned work pants or betaking himself to the Newfangled World . He left the country . Dorcas drove up to the pier as RoIf 's steamer pulled out for " Sydamerika . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hint that she would keep him posted on her affections if he could see his way clear to keep her in stamps and incidentals . Roll ' waved and waved ; and once out there among duskier charms and inflated prices , the memory of her dearness stood for all that was fair and true , and he worked hard and remitted on the dot  --  up to the day Dorcas answered , announcing across the sunset view of a penny postal her engagement to a civil servant of considerable means and years . Rolf threw up his mean job in an assayer 's office and fell to shopping for a pertinent wedding present . Finally in the harbor district of Pernambuco he found Papagaio . With the purchase went a onehundred-year guarantee of the parrot 's scurrility . Rolf 's malice aforethought was excellent . He intended to hide the bird underneath the altar cloth in the church where the wedding was going to take place and then hide himself behind a pillar . As the pastor intoned and the dastards clasped hands , he would crack Brazil nuts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready with hunger . After Papagaio had subsided sufficiently for someone else to be heard , Rolf would stalk up to the swooned Dorcas , crunch with his heel the dried-up bouquet of forget-me-nots , laugh bitterly , and take his leave , shaken to the marrow yet unbowed . The plan miscarried . Arriving on the scene late at night to install Papagaio , Rolf found himself ankle-deep in confetti and rice . He had traveled nine thousand miles and was eleven hours too late . Good advice coming high , he sat down in a pew and consulted his traveling flask filled with expensive cognac . Then he went as straight as possible to the newly-wedded couple 's home . It was a warm , dark summer night , and a soft , cooing laughter issued from the veiled persiennes of the bridal chamber , shot through with the several gleams of a dimmed magenta light . Rolf recognized the stage only toowell . Obsessed by a mad craving to shift the suggestive scenes and jumble the ribald lines , he climbed a porch rail ; broke the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forget-me-nots at the four-poster within ; drew his revolver and picked off the gingerbread on the headboard with a deafening six-gun wedding salute ; bashed in the hateful magenta lights ; jumped down , shouting , " Good night  --  sleep tight ! " and caught a milk train for the nearest seaport and returned to South America , never to see his homeland again , never to skimp and slave and remit , ever to taunt and contrive and destroy . The civil servant succumbed in the au- , tumn to old age , accelerated by shock . Looking very pagsionate and purposeful in her black-and-white half-mourning ensemble , Dorcas went directly from the burial to see Fru Wachencrantz and find out Rolf 's new address . She countered Fru Wachencrantz ' sardonic smile by declaring that Rolf had always been foremost in her bosom  --  well , others might have leaned on it , but while doing so they had filled her hope chest . Fru Wachencrantz offered to trade in what little she knew of Rolf 's whereabouts for Papagaio . It was a bargain ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't answer her letters . Her subsequent career was catastrophic ; she married a repeatedly widowed tanner , an imperturbable man with the leanings of a wife-tamer . S OME time after Inge turned seven , his father , who lived up to his military profession by wearing tight riding breeches and talking in the lingo of the King 's Horse Artillery , happened to lay his eyes on the child in earnest , and thereupon marched him to the servant girls in the big downstairs kitchen , and commanded , " Mobilize the man in this noneffective . " A great deal of laughter was spent and a few tears were wasted as the girls lifted Inge onto the meat block , undressed him , and sized him up . They decided that the Herr Warrant Officer and Estate Owner probably wanted Inge 's long hair and pinafore to come off and a jacket and reinforced pants to go on ; the most loving mused that though the boy 's hair might not be of any particular color , it was like ciderdown to the touch , and that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least wear a bang ; and all agreed that the pants might well be prettied in the behind with bice moleskin and on the front with mother-of-pearl buttons . Inge felt frigid . His father 's gruff soldier talk and the servant girls ' gush did n't fire his imagination . Nothing worthwhile seemed to come from all this chatter about manliness . No damnable longings and choice sins fit to envy were laid bare ? only his goose flesh . And the church bells were clanking , too , hardly a sportive . . . Could it be Sunday with those bells ringing ? Might not his grandmother be dusting around the love seat at that very moment ? Inge slid off the meat block , snatched at his clothes , got the pinafore , and was gone . The servant girls gaped at the slammed door . Inge 's visits to Fru Wachencrantz ' apartment had n't come off so well lately ; indeed he had n't heard anything about Rolf for months , because of the lamentable state of his grandfather 's health . The sublime calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fully ten minutes while taking bearings , had aroused Herr Wachencrantz to such dizzy mental heights that he had come down with a stroke , which , besides worsening the lameness of his extremities from partial to total , had loosened his tongue . The next manifestation from above would sod him ; in the meantime he should be put on a liquid diet as an acclimatization to the spirit world , the doctor had prescribed . Fru Wachencrantz and Petronella took turns sitting at his bedside , spoon-feeding him Oporto and nodding assent to his poisonous dissertations on the differences between the swift flight of a wild goose and the sluggish waddle of a silly old goose . But now intuition served Inge well , for Fru Wachencrantz was in her salon when he peered in . She was n't dusting though . Dressed elegantly in gray velvet and bespangled here and there with the more wearable of Rolf 's gifts , she was kneeling by the love seat . The Mr. Badman album was propped up against it , opened at the contemplative picture of Rolf on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , back and forth , precisely like the parish church bells , which were going full blast now . As Inge sidled up to her , she began to read aloud from a sheaf of newspaper clippings , headed with big fat words . Fru Wachencrantz was in tiptop form . Head thrown back , she spat out the French version with sparkling bravado and mocking gestures , as to a frenetic gallery ; changing into a bullnecked stance , she stormed convincingly in German . But she seemed to be in no hurry to translate the news into the dialect of the Sund . Instead she behaved as if the performance was ended . Slowly and deliberately she peeled off her fineries . From her bosom she took a sleek miniature chronometer , its case fashioned like a sea-shell and the dial graduated to tell , among other extraordinary information , the dog watches on shipboard ; from her waist , a vanity case and coin purse of medieval robber-proof chain mail ; from underneath her chins , an outsize cameo with amorino bowmen ; from her ear lobes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sabre-toothed necklace , which had never fitted her neck . And she put them away in Rolf 's concepLion of a jewel chest  --  a small imitation of an Assian stone sarcophagus . This chest she snapped shut , leaving the key inside . Full of wonder , Inge touched Fru Wachencrantz ' arm questioningly . " Oh , yes , " she said , " the holders of Interbourse Preferential are going to seed because Rolf has been shot by hidden forces in the interior  --  in Boa Esperanza and between the shoulder-blades . " She put the trinket coffin and the Life and Death of Mr. Badman in the love seat , closed the lid with a bang , buried her head in her skirt , and sorrowed with her shoulders . I NGE knew at once what a death knell was . It was made up of sounds the ear might hear but only the heart could grasp  --  the nailing down of a memento casket , the closing of a reckoning book , the slam of a love seat , the crumbling of a life span , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time by the echoing report of a Mauser carbine fired from close ambush in the wilds of the world . His grandmother 's anguish sickened Inge . Whatever blood he had in his veins coursed upward , where it constricted his throat , thickened his tongue , choked his nose , blurred his eyes , clogged his ears , pummeled his temples . He knew he should n't scream and kick and roll on the floor , yet he felt he must or else suffocate . He had done it before , he would do it now . Nothing but air could save him . . . ice water could n't , whipping could n't . . . air could . . . would .. ? oh . air was coming his way . . . . He could breath a little now , and smell a lot ! Attar of roses ? No , a delicious whiff of eel in paper . . . . The breath of life cleared Inge 's head . Suddenly he realized that , despite the sound of the bells , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of Oporto and fortuitous events . After having received the newspaper clippings in the morning mail , his grandmother had started the dinner and put it in the oven , and had begun planning the funeral of what there was of Rolf at the Sund . She had sent word to the sexton to toll the bells ; she had read the burial litany herself , from Le Matin and the Boersen-Courier ; now she was kneel-ing by the graveside ; but she would surely arise in time for the collation . It was up to Inge not to disturb her  --  to forget his alleged new manliness and be noneffective . The boy stood at ease behind Fru Wachencrantz . But for his pinafore he had not a stitch on , a shortage he was unaware of . Drops of blood trickled steadily from his nostrils , and on his lips red , frothy bubbles rose and sank when he breathed  --  just as other red bubbles had fallen in Boa Esperanza : fallen from the saddle horn , against which Ralf Wachencrantz ' lifeless body slumped  --  fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a panicked horse . The mestico who had at last caught the running horse had not been able to see the image of the Sund imprinted in the outlander 's glassy pupils , nor the crossed-out name Dorcas above his heart , yet he had sensed the importance of the slain Senhor . And soon a telegraph key had begun tapping . Jeremiad OSCAR WILLIAMS W HEN the bird flew from the Columbus hull And swung our canyons from its fabled beak , Or gravitation donned long gloves of bough To drop its apple in perception 's lap , How was the embattled Spirit to conceive Monstrosities lay breathing in the good , That limbs of lambs could grow the heads of wolves ? The multitudes who built a wall of graves Around the golden calf of nothingness And faced the deathrays of the deathless smile Through the vast stretches of injustice brought The flower brimming in the crack of light  --  They open valves to brimstone on our sleep And freight the air with tons of memory . Now out of reservoirs of misery Our language glistens with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the books ; While prodded by war planes of an angry day Out of abstraction 's bed we turn to meet The gigantic sense of failure darkening The many windowed framework of the skull . And once again , and maybe more than once Again , must we put down the clockwheel tools And apron of our carelessness , and rise And throw our bodies , our bags of blood , against The rocks of Mammonhood and so blot out The evil writing on the tidal wall , The Red Sea running down the heart of God .
