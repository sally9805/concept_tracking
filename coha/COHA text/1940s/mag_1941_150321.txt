The Stukas swooped across the Aegean skies like dark , dreadful birds , but they dropped no bombs on the monks of Mount Athos . The motorized Nazi hordes rumbled across the Salonikan peninsula , but they did not invade its 40-mile-long eastern cape where the holy and historic Mount towers in misty beauty above monasteries perching like fabulous castles on crags above the sea . Surrounded by flower-scented glens and gorges , veiled with pine and cypress and chestnut , are great Lavra Monastery , Vatopdi , Simpetra , bastioned Dionysiou ( which proudly possesses the brain and right hand of Saint John the Baptist ) and many others , each with its fusty library and gilded Byzantine church . <P> Last week Adolf Hitler gave no hint of what he proposed to do about this great religious prize which was his for the taking-the autonomous ecclesiastical republic of Mount Athos , 1,000-year-old capital of Greek Orthodoxy , governed by a council consisting of one monk from each of its 20 stony retreats . <P> The 5,000 bearded , black-robed Greek , Russian , Serbian , Bulgarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many reasons-religion , disappointment in love , political conspiracy , seeking sanctuary against political or criminal punishment . They include several former Greek lunchroom proprietors who fled the clatter of U.S. civilization . They live in two kinds of monasteries : cenobite ( communistic ) and idiorrhythmic ( allowing private property , which reverts to the monastery ) . Many of them lead a truly monkish life of prayer and Church scholarship , a shabby life without bathing or toothbrushing , with a meatless diet and only brief snatches of sleep , because " sleep inflames the body . " They live on contributions and on the making and selling of wine , farm products , religious paintings and trinkets . Some are so ignorant or unworldly that they have heard only vaguely of Adolf Hitler- " a great German king who slays the Bolsheviks and the Jews-a fulfillment of prophecy . " <P> But in recent years the world has been altogether too much with Mount Athos to please its pure in heart . For one thing , the world 's sad economy has impoverished the religious life even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady flow of Russian funds into Mount Athos , and war and world depression have sharply cut all other income . The ancient sins of luxury have been increasingly apparent both outside and inside the holy ground . Vigorous young monks are rare . " We need young men today more than ever , " one Athonite has said , " but they prefer to fatten their ephemeral bodies and clothe them in silk shirts and ties . " <P> On the Mount itself , one of the wealthier monasteries has permitted itself all manner of worldly indulgences-central plumbing , mirrors , electric lights , newspapers , motorboats , wine-pressing machinery ( instead of the industrious barefoot method ) . An alarming number of monks have taken to smoking , alcohol , even narcotics . And the immemorial escape from celibacy has threatened to become a fever sickening the whole " Great Academy of the Greek Clergy . " The Greek press has stormed about the kidnapping of male children for the monks of Athos , and motorboats carrying male prostitutes are constantly reported chugging into the monastery harbors.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
