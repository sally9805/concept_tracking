There was a curse on Key West for twenty years . No other American town ever suffered such an unbroken series of blights . While all Florida boomed . and upstart Miami multiplied nearly fifty times , ; Key West was losing almost half her people . But her luck has turned at last . Key West had its beginnings in piracy . In 1822 the buccaneers still infested the keys and laughed at the Navy 's deep-draught ships , which could not follow them . Commodore Porter , in that year , established a naval base there , built a fleet of small , shallow-draught chasers , and used the Navy 's first steam-powered vessel to tow the chasers when the wind failed . That ended the pirates . Wrecking was the next industry and sometimes it was difficult to detect the border line between piracy and wrecking . All the heavy traffic of the Florida straits passed close at hand and much of it went afoul of the unlighted keys . When a ship failed . 1 to get into difficulties unaided , there were ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wreck A-s-h-o-r-e ! " would empty a church as quickly as a cry of " Fire ! " ; for the first to put a line aboard the distressed ship became the wrecking master with a salvage claim , and twenty to thirty sailing craft , some as large as fifty tons , always were waiting for such a prize . The cargo would be sold at auction in Key West . Fortunes were made in wrecking , and most of the early population was attracted from the Bahamas by this gamble . The descendants of these original settlers are known as " conches , " from the Spanish concha , for shell . Squire Eagan was holding Methodist services in the courthouse one Sunday morning when , from his position behind the pulpit , he saw a brig beating down dangerously near Sambos . Out of the corner of his eye he saw her go hard ashore . The squire owned a wrecking vessel , the Godspeed , and he knew that if he announced the wreck from the pulpit every competitor would beat him uut the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that they which run in a race run all , but one receiveth the prize ? So run , that ye may obtain . " Expounding this text , the squire worked his way down from the pulpit and down the aisle . When he approached the door he yelled , " Wreck A-s-h-cer-e ! " and lit out for his schooner , the congregation pelting at his heels . The Godspeed got there first . The Army and Marine Corps follower/ the Navy into Key West , and in 1831 the first cigar factory in the United States was opened there , the beginnings of what became Key West 's greatest industry . Cuban tobacco was brought across the ninety miles of water from Havana at much less duty than the finished Havana cigar had to pay . By 1860 it was Florida 's largest town except Pensacola . Though it was the only place in the South other than Fort Pickens , Pensacola and Fortress Monroe which never passed out of the control of the Union in the Civil War , blockade running was rife in the keys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the beginnings of Cuba 's wars for independence from Spain in the late fin 's , refugees began to increase the town 's population largely . It became an important port . The sponge fisheries were a source of wealth . Then , early in the twentieth century , Henry M. Flagler , one of t he original Continued on Pape 551 // Continued from Puige 171 partners in Standard Oil and , after Rockefeller , the strongest man in it , had the dream of extending his Florida East Coast Railroad 106 miles to sea over the keys to Key West . Those who did not say that Flagler was senile said that he was mad , and hardly was construction well under way before the panic of 1907 froze the money market . When no one would lend him money for a seagoing railroad , he pawned every share he owned of Standard Oil stock to save the enterprise . Finally came the great day in 1912 when the rails reached Key West , and the first train ran through from New York , connecting the next year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 6000 population and Miami Beach was unthought of . Key West 's luck turned sour that very year , though it did not realize it for a long time . Trains were no more than running when Flagler died , in his eighty-third year . This had been only the beginning of his dreams for Key West . He saw in it and the Overseas Railroad the key with which to unlock the undeveloped wealth of all Latin America , and he intended dredging the harbor , building docks and launching shipping lines to connect here with his rails . That dream expired with him . Without such connections , the Overseas Railroad had only Cuban traffic to draw upon , and it must compete for this with every ship that touched at Cuba . It never , therefore , repaid its cost , and the Florida East Coast Railroad was not too unhappy when the hurricane of 1935 ripped out forty-five miles of the extension . Now there began to be trouble in the cigar factories ; first labor troubles and a partial migration of the industry to Tampa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hand worker on cheaper grades of cigars , then air conditioning completed the ruin of Key West 's first industry . Until then , the Havana cigar had to be rolled and wrapped in the warm , moist air of the Florida coast . Under mechanical control of humidity and temperature , they could be made as well in Trenton , New Jersey , or where you willed . But the World War brought new prosperity to the port , and prohibition took up some of the postwar slack . The thousands of keys and their proximity to Cuba and the Bahamas made them a rumrunners ' paradise . When the Coast Guard patrol got tighter , the rumrunners used to start a fire in Key West , usually in an abandoned cigar factory . In a town where every ablebodied male is a member of the volunteer fire company , a fire is a good way of distracting attention while a cargo of liquor is landed . Then the Florida boom was set off . Miami leaped to 30,000 population in 1920 , then to 110,000 in 1930 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older city . The passenger steamers which formerly had called at Key West began to shift to Miami and , with them , much of the Cuban trade . Pan American Airways had its beginnings in Key West , but Miami stole it away . Coast Guard headquarters was shifted to Mobile . In the economy drive of the Hoover Administration , the navy yard was shut down and the coast-artillery posts left with a skeleton guard . This was almost the final blow , fir the town had been founded originally on the navy yard and had taken it far granted . There is no agriculture whatever on the keys . Key West had been pretty scornful of the winter-tourist traffic which made Miami , and that traffic stopped there . Except for a little commercial fishing , Key West 's population , now fallen from 20,000 to 12,927 , was reduced to the classical condition of taking in one another 's washing . Here is where the New Deal stepped in and kept it alive with FERA money  --  later PWA and WPA , and so on . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was living on New Deal charity when the storm ended the railroad . With the railroad went the highway which , in later years , had been projected to parallel it . Florida had lacked the money to complete the highway and there still were two long ferry transfers between the mainland and Key West . Except for the Tampa-Havana steamers , which put in at Key West , and for an occasional Mallory freighter from New York and Galveston , the town was cut off from the United States . The railroad , obviously , never would he restored . Wreck A-s-h-o-r-e ! " Key West had foundered and Uncle Sam was the wreck master . This was the second-act curtain of the Key West melodrama . With the rise of the curtain on the third act , virtue began to triumph and vice to meet its just dues . A bridge district was formed and the PWA was applied to fur a loan and grant . The Government made them no grant , but it did lend them $:3,600,001 . ) , With $640,000 of this the bridge district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mainland at Florida City . Over the stretch where the two ferries operated , the railroad was rebuilt as a highway . The work began on January 1 , 1937 , and on March 29 , 1938 , the road was opened . Eventually the railroad right of way will be used by the highway for its entire distance , shortening and speeding the journey . Much of the railroad was concrete viaduct , but amid the longest overwater stretch Flagler 's engineers had had to build a heavy steel bridge over Bahia Honda channel , where the water is forty-five feet deep and the tides race swiftly . The bridge was undamaged by the storm , but it was only fourteen feet wide between the high steel trusses . To replace it would be prohibitively expensive ; to use it apparently made one-way traffic unavoidable , until an ingenious engineer thought of building the highway over instead of through the trusses . Thereby he got his standard twenty-foot width , and so here the road rises and dips like a roller coaster . There is one toll charge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twentyfive cents for each passenger ; cheap for a drive that is unlike anything else in the world . You are almost as literally at sea much of the way as if you were on the Havana steamer , the Gulf on one hand , the Atlantic on the other . With every variation in depth , the water changes color , and the fish swarm below you as in an aquarium . Drop a line over anywhere and the fight is on . Half the fun for the novice is guessing what he will draw out of the grab bag ; it can be most anything from a yellowtail to a shark or a poisonous eel . At intervals are public fishing camps offering everything that the Miami fishing boats give , plus the feeling of having been cast up on a South Seas atoll . If you are afraid of wind , steel-and-concrete shelters calculated to withstand a force of 300 miles an hour have been spotted along the road , but the hurricane is seasonal and the odds are long that you would run afoul of one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the story that Paramount had assigned a cameraman to hole up in one of these shelters and wait for a hurricane , nothing less than the genuine being good enough for Reap the Wild Wind . You are likely to wait a long time to see this picture if Paramount is going to wait upon Nature to keep a date on the keys . The highway restored Key West , but there were other strokes of good fortune . Ernest Hemingway is given most of the credit for bringing it a literary and art colony that has made of it a sort of winter Provincetown . Hemingway , always a seeker after far places , became interested in it at its nadir , and others followed in his wake . Presumably he will not return , as his home went to Mrs. Hemingway on their divorce last year , but Key West no longer needs him . The U. S. .11. ' s Farthest South Miami , Miami Beach and all South Florida have grown so fat now that the tourist traffic , winter and summer , more and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is trying to imitate the night life of Miami Beach in an " original " Sloppy Joe 's , in the Cabatia Club of Fred Marvel , whom the Spanish civil war chased out of his Little Club in Mallorca , and Stork Club No. 683 , Key West still is sharply contrasted with the Fifty-second Street atmosphere of Miami Beach . The tourist who dislikes the very things which make Miami Beach Miami Beach , is finding rest and quiet farther south . The more the Miami area booms now , the more Key West will prosper , living henceforth , like all South Florida , on the tourists and the retired couples . It talks now of an overseas aqueduct from Homestead , 130 miles , to bring it fresh water . For drinking and cooking it still depends upon rain water . Under the porch on which you sit drinking your host 's daiquiri there probably is a cistern holding 15,000 gallons of soft water collected from his roof . The city water is euphemistically known as " surface water . " It comes from shallow wells . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to water the indigenous tropical vegetation , which never has known any other kind of drink . But if you covet a flower garden of annuals , the kind of flowers you have known at home , and a lawn , you must give them cistern water . That may not be feasible in a climate where it sometimes does not rain for four months in winter . For two generations the southernmost house in the United States , and so celebrated on post cards , was the big frame home of Judge and Mrs. Harris . She was the daughter of William Curry , the town 's great merchant . The fortune he made in blockade running in the Civil War he sent to London as fast as he made it , converting the rapidly depreciating Confederate currency into sterling . In the panic of 1873 he brought the money hack and reconverted it into the then-depreciated dollar , which soon recovered . Judge and Mrs. Harris are dead . Their heirs have no interest in the property and it now is a tourist home . On the south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1941 Gulf Stream architecture has risen to rob it of its distinction . The owner of the new home is Thelma Strabel , whom Post readers will remember for her serial of early Key West , Reap the Wild Wind , published last spring . We have the Coast and Geodetic Survey 's official word for it that the Strahel house is 93.2 miles farther south than Brownsville , Texas . Key West 's latitude is 24 ? 32 ' 47 " ; Brownsville 's is 25 ? 54 ' 01 " . Just as a souvenir , the Black Queen turned up in Key West 's hand once again , in 1938 , when a blight fell upon the sponges and ended that nice little industry , but by then the highway was open and the town shrugged it off . On January 6 , 1867 , the steamer San Francisco put into Key West because of cholera aboard . Mark Twain was a passenger . Key West appears to have been in one of its periodic slumps then . In what must have been California 's first slur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Alta California : " At a little distance the town looks whitewashed and very pretty , but a closer inspection discovers that the whitewash is dingy and that the whole concern bath about it a melancholy air of decay . It do n't raise anything and it do n't manufacture anything and I wondered how in heaven the people got their living . They live off the Government . " Twain went on to list the forts , barracks , navy yard , and so forth , and to add : " Two or three times a year a stray ship wanders in and is a Godsend . They scorch her ! Everybody was afraid the health officers would not allow us to land with our cholera . Vain delusion ! If a health officer were to stand between them and their livelihood that way they would discharge him . They do n't mind pestilences . Their doctor called our cholera ' malignant diarrhoea ' and cheerfully let us land and spend our $3000 or $4000 . That will last them until fortune betrays another ship into their hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicines our ship paid $2011.20 . Labor bill for putting the coal aboard was $205 ; it would have been twenty-five dollars in New York . " Twain was not one to let accuracy get in the way of a good story , yet more visitors than he have thought Key West disappointingly colorless . That depends upon what you expect . If you have in mind a smaller Havana or a Pago Pago , you , too , will grumble . The town is predominantly American and therefore not exotic . It is old , it has seen hard times , and sun , rain and salt winds have bleached its frame houses . Yet it is unlike any other town in the United States and its situation is unique in the world . The traveler with an eye for strangeness and beauty will find enough of both here at no discomfort and at reasonable cost . The others can be back in Miami in a few hours . It is a sleepy town , and the Key West date line has not been seen often in American newspapers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bizarre a news story as 1940 recorded . A seventy-year-old German , Karl Tanzer von Cosel , was arrested on a charge of having stolen from a vault in the cemetery the body of a nineteenyear-old woman who had died in 1931 , reconstructing the body with wax and plaster of Paris , smuggling it from place to place by airplane and finally installing it in a bed in which he slept beside it nightly . Queer Romance Von Cosel was a pre-Hitlerian emigrant from Germany . Claiming nine German degrees in medicine , chemistry and engineering , he appeared first in Key West as the X-ray specialist in the Marine Hospital . He got a monthly remittance from Germany until the Nazis took over . Since he has lost both his hospital job and his remittance , his source of income has puzzled his fellow townsmen . Nearly ten years ago Mrs. Elena Hoyos Mesa , wife of a waiter , was brought to the hospital , dying of tuberculosis . Von Cosel became infatuated with her , wished to marry her , but she died shortly . After her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body and put it in a tomb which the German had had built in the form of a miniature church . There were always chairs in the tomb and he sat there often . He connected the tomb by telephone with his home , that he might " talk with Elena on rainy days . " All Key West knew of his eccentricities , but until October fifth the town supposed the body still rested in the tomb . After sheriff 's deputies , acting on a tip , had found it in Von Cosel 's home , on the other end of the island , he confessed that he had taken it from the tomb seven years earlier : About 1933 he had bought a damaged airplane and begun to rebuild it on aerodynamic lines all his own . He first smuggled the body from the cemetery to the hospital in the plane . When he lost the hospital position he got permission to use an abandoned abattoir on the beach as a hangar , and none gave any thought to the plane being trundled across town , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was evicted from the old abattoir , he again moved the body inside the plane . Last summer Dale Wimbrow , a Miami Beach radio entertainer , was in Key West taking photographs for an article he hoped to sell to the Poet . He photographed Von Cosel standing in the door of his hangar , and the tomb , in which Wimbrow , of course , supposed the body still to be . The Post did not buy the article , but it did buy the photographs to supplement the color pictures it already had planned to take of Key West . Nothing appears to have remained of Elena Mesa 's body but the skeleton by 1933 , but Von Cosel , who is , among other things , a sculptor and a painter , reconstructed so striking an image that it at first was supposed he had done an extraordinary job of embalming . ( Continued an Page 58 ) ( Continued from Page 56 ) From the father he had bought the bed in which the young woman died . The deputies found the body in this bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an artificial rose in the hair and gold bracelets on the wrists . Von Cosel had been sleeping at her side for seven years , possessed of a conviction that he could restore her to life . He talks gladly about his obsession , and has said that when he had accomplished this , he and Elena were to have flown away in his plane  --  which has yet to fly . He was promptly acquitted of insanity , and later the criminal charges were dropped on the technicality of the statute of limitations . Actually , the town could see nothing criminal in his act , and much of it believes that the tip to the sheriff 's office came only after he had ceased to pay blackmail . The aged German , whose short beard is kept neatly trimmed , pleaded that the body be restored to him or that , at least , he be allowed one last look . Both pleas were denied , though the body had been on public display at an undertaker 's for days , attracting thousands of curious . This was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can take vacations take them and when few visitors come , but traffic on the Overseas Highway set a new record for a week .
