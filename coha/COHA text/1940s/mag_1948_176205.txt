The South 's dissident Dixiecrats had twice broken all modern records for emitting rebel yells , waving the Confederate flag , and complaining about the North . Nevertheless , with the Democratic National Convention and their own Birmingham convention behind them , they gathered in Houston last week and went through the noisy act all over again . The occasion : Governor J. Strom Thurmond 's formal acceptance of the Dixiecrat presidential nomination . <P> South Carolina 's Thurmond , who fervently hoped to capture Texas and its 23 electoral votes , made it plain to his cheering audience , at least , that the Dixiecrats were the only hope of the South-yes , of the whole country . He lumped Harry Truman , Tom Dewey and Henry Wallace together and solemnly declared that they all hoped to give the country the " new Russian look . " Harry Truman 's civil-rights program , he said , was a plot to make the U.S. a police state . <P> " Shall we , " he yelled , " be so blind as to follow those who would lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hitler led the people of Germany , Mussolini led the people of Italy , and . . . Stalin is leading the people of Russia ? " He strongly intimated that a sensible man would decide no . <P> When he was through , the Dixiecrats howled and snake-danced for a full ten minutes . <P> But they did not capture Texas . In an attempt to get their candidates on the ballot they took full-page newspaper advertisements , pleaded that the whole Democrat-Dixiecrat problem be presented to the voters in a referendum . The Texas State Central Committee , dominated by Governor Beauford Jester , refused . The Dixiecrats still had hope-though their chances looked slim , they were hell-bent to get control of the Texas State Democratic Convention next month .
