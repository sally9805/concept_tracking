Albert Lea , Minn , is a clean , wide-avenued lakeside city of 12,000 , a hundred miles south of Minneapolis , smack in the middle of the rich northern dairyland . It won the honor of being Freeborn County 's seat about 80 years ago in a horse race . But Albert Lea is about to become something of a household word . Reason : it has made such an excellent and meticulous study of its postwar prospects that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , in a 55-page pamphlet , is holding up Albert Lea as a good example to all the U.S. <P> Tom 's Idea . A top-notch Minnesota banker , greying , heavy-set John Cameron Thomson , had the idea . " Tom " Thomson , 53 , heads the Northwest Bancorporation ( consolidated assets : $800 million ) , an 82-bank Midwestern outfit that ranks second to the Giannini Transamerica Corp . among U.S. bank holding companies . Thomson is also vice chairman of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce 's Economic Policy Committee , and one of their powwows last spring set him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Minnesota friends to help him form the Northwest Research Committee . They picked Albert Lea as their guinea pig : it represented a neatly balanced war-busy industry and farming . Last June , under the spur of N.R.C. , 46 Albert Lea citizens began to examine their city and county . The U.S. Chamber 's pamphlet tells what the Albert Leamen and N.R.C. found out . <P> How Many Jobs ? Albert Lea 's planners took as their objective " a postwar job paying a living wage for every worker who wanted one . " The eleven biggest industries in the town ( meat packing , machinery , etc. ) were asked to write down their employment and business volume for 1940 as against 1943 , and their hopes for the first year of peace . The eleven , encouraged by a 125% war expansion , figured they could employ 60% more people after the war than in 1940 . Hearing this , the city 's 442 other employers upped their own payroll estimates by 15% . <P> After figuring out how many soldiers would come back , how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exact size of its postwar unemployment problem : 593 workers , out of a total labor force of 6,571 . <P> How Much Demand ? Meanwhile , 130 " Victory Aides " canvassed three out of every ten city families , mailed questionnaires to a sample group of the county 's farmers , to find the demand for durable goods ( from autos to alarm clocks ) in three different income groups . Examples of returns : <P> &gt; A solid market exists in Freeborn County for 2,296 new cars , for 646 refrigerators , 578 furniture sets , 442 new city homes , 360 barns , 360 silos , 780 tractors , 810 prefabricated small farm buildings ( Albert Lea has a factory that makes them ) , 986 vacation trips at an average cost of $176 . <P> &gt; Freeborn farmers expect to pay for 50-75% of these goods out of current income . City families went in for heavier borrowing . <P> &gt; The total two-year market for goods after the war added up to $12,374,900 . <P> &gt; City and county officials figured they could spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Two other groups went to work on the county 's income and liquid assets .
