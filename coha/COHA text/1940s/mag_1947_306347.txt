Before sunup one day last week , the queue started to form in front of Barry 's Jewelry Store in Glendale , Calif . By noon , when the doors opened , there were 3,000 in line . Waiting for them were twelve regular and eight extra clerks , one uniformed policeman , one private detective . Waiting , too , were electric clocks , cigaret lighters , liquor sets-18,500 items in all . Retail value ran from $2 to $50 . But for each item the price was only 18 , in honor of Barry 's 18th anniversary . <P> Barry 's birthday guests grabbed , pawed , rushed wildly from counter to counter . By 6 o'clock , when only tie clasps , flashlights and wallets were left , the doors were closed to replenish stocks , then reopened . Finally , at 11:30 p.m. , the exhausted sales force gave up . The customers were told to help themselves ; they did . <P> When it was all over , the 10,000 customers had bought merchandise with a retail value of $80,000 . By buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $20,000 . The store 's owner , dapper , suntanned Sam Behrstock , 43 , estimates that his yearly anniversary sale increases his volume of business the rest of the year by 40% ; people remember the name , come back . Behrstock started his give-away sale ten years ago , feels it is cheap advertising . Says Behrstock : " The idea was just short of an inspiration . And it makes me feel good to give .
