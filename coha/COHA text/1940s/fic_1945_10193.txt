" What kind of role do you like best , Mr. Fingers ? " Annie Talbot asked , when I was goggling at Penny . " Role ? " I echoed stupidly . I had heard the word , but was too scatterbrained to recall it . " She does n't mean the kind you take in bed with honey , " Penny broke in , her voice lilting with joy at the broad joke . At this point in my chronicle a warning is in order . If these pages reach the eyes of the people of Massachusetts , whose mannersand morals stem from the Puritans , perhaps all but the backslidersshould skip the chapters dealing with my life as a strollingplayer . English morals and manners under Georges I and II were by no means prudish ; those of the stage were not so much a further liberalization of these as a different set altogether , fashionedto fit players ' lives . I had not yet grasped their philosophy , but soon perceived that they had little respect for so-called conventionand anything earthy was a fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty Penny for that kind , " I said . The Company roared , and I think took me to their hearts at the instant . Actually I had had good practice at bawdy wit in aleshops and the like , . but had surpassed myself . " You 'll try all kinds of characters , before you 're through , " said Master Purdy , when the laughter had died down . " But , Dick , I do n't know as I like your name too well for the boards . It might suggest to a bailiff the name of a pickpocket . " It was the name of a pickpocket . But Jerry of Jerry 's Jollies had not gone to school in vain : I do n't think I started visibly or changed color . " Yes , sir , " I said . " Anyway , real names are a disadvantage for an unlicensed company . The bailiffs do n't want to find us  --  if we 're summoned  --  and we do n't want to drive ' em to it . Have ye thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought a little of Richard Thorndyke . " " ' T is good , but ' t would suit a heavy better than a comic . What think you of Richard Romp ? "  | " It sounds too much like Richard Rump , " said Annie , who loved coarseness for its own sake . " Rick Royster , " suggested Herbert Rutland . " Good enough for a buffoon , but what if he 'd turn out a tragedian ? " Jack Millford remarked . " Then we 'll call him Dick Drury , after the theater that first discovered him , " declared Master Purdy , as though I were a great find , which no doubt he was able to believe , while full of ale and optimism . " If he takes to serious parts , Richard Drury will do him well . " Two other names I had borne , neither wetted with holy water . Now I was to be christened with something better , if my heart told me the truth . Beautiful Penny Price rose from her bench , encircled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Welcome , Dick Drury , " she said , giving me an unstinted kiss . Only just now I had been longing to press my lips to hers . It had been no trifling fancy either , but a surge of feeling deep and strong , so beautiful she seemed to me , and so little beauty had come my way . Her lips were fully as alive and warm as I had imagined them , fit for the alive , warm mirth they gave birth to ; and so sweet , so utterly sweet , that my boy 's heart nearly burst . Then Mrs. Reynolds , sittting beside me , leaned over and gave me a motherly kiss . Annie Talbot was not far behind , although her kiss was quite another sort from either of the others , her lips drawn crossways across mine . Not that she meant the least harm . If she were curious about what entertainment I might furnish her  --  the first thought that crosses some wenches ' mind in regard to any man  --  this was by no means an invitation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most from every sociability . The three men shook hands with me , and then the whole company raised their mugs to drink to their new member , Dick Drury . And so the name was given me , with happy hearts , and with a jubilant heart I accepted it , not dreaming yet of its potentialitiesfor good or evil , for inward and outward change , and for the tentacles that any name wraps around the soul . That night I slept three-in-a-bed with Herbert Rutland and Jack Millford . Since I fancied myself as having come up in the world , and since they had come down a little from the personages I had first fancied them , I did not feel too ill at ease in this close company . Also I noticed that they scratched themselves vigorously from time to time during the night . But the amount of sleeping I did would hardly suffice a cricket . In the morning Master Purdy offered to go with me to Lloyd 's Bank to get my gold . Remembering the amount there  --  not seven pounds but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble with the business , having found the clerk who signed my deposit receipt , and he being good enough to remember me . Then I paid Solomon the guinea I owed him on my clothes , sewed two others in the lining of my coat craftily under two buttons  --  where a playful pinch would not reveal them  --  put seven shillings in my purse , and seven gold sovereigns into Master Purdy 's trembling , freckled hand . He heaved a great sigh of relief . No doubt he had feared that the yellow money was of the same stuff as his own pots of gold . To my great joy , there was then no falling off in his welcome to me . The only change in the others ' attitude was more camaraderieand trust . When Master Purdy had presented me with a document declaring me a tenth-owner in the Company , he took me into the stables of the Red Bull and showed me our assets . These consisted of an old but still sturdy mare , a cart , some stage scenery , and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innkeeper . As soon as the trifle was attended to , all of our company put our best clothes in the chests  --  in a manner of speaking they were costumes too  --  and donned our secondp53best or worst , whichever we chose to call them . Then with Master Purdy driving the cart , Mrs. Reynolds on the seat beside him , and the rest keeping pace on the sidewalk , we started out Oxford Street toward Uxbridge . There was never a happier journey than was mine between London and Ealing that summer day . No palmer on the home stretch to the Holy Land could be more full and overflowing with happiness ; I splashed it out in bucketfuls at every stile , and the fountain never failed . Partly it was the flush of my heart at a new and strange adventure . Partly it was its warmth in this company of childlike and happy hearts . I had never dreamed of such companionship . I know that no lords and ladies roistering in a castle knew joy like ours , or had capacity for such joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created their own world to suit them , and let me share it with them . It was not the bleak and bitter world God bade us live in : it was higher than that ; indeed , looking down upon that sour earth from the infinite height of the Stage . Regardless of the measure of their talents , my companionswere players . Every one had that happiest of mortal gifts  --  Make-Believe . We had not got a mile from the thicker houses before Master Purdy became a driver of a chariot in a Roman battle , with a wonderful speech to his steeds . Then Annie Talbot mounted the cart  --  doubtless she wanted to rest her feet besides  --  and became a Christian maiden in Nero 's time , being carried to the arena to die a martyr 's death in the claws of lions . From then on the show rarely lagged . Most of it was rags and tatters of old plays ; some was farce invented on the spot about one another 's foibles and the incidents of the journey . The wonder of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a paying audience . Each performedat the height of his talent , and if his skit pleased , the others applauded wildly . God 's Blood , I thought , what a company of genius I am with ! I had not yet heard Penny sing . She had hummed and whistled , but not yet opened that round , white throat . When she did so , there came a creeping along my spine unlike any sensationI had ever experienced . She breathed song : it seemed that easy . She opened that wonderful mouth and out it came . Each note seemed to have music running up and down its sides , so round and full it was ; if sound can be compared to light , I would call it glimmering . One could not choose but listen , or to hear its strange accompaniment , which I think w4s the echo of all the joys and sorrows one had known . Perhaps I heard it through magicked ears . Again , it might have been one of the great voices of the age : I am by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to greatness in this instance too . However , it would not be known as greatness according to the yardsticksof the time . Only yesterday in England was the term appliedeven to divine poets ; it was yet begrudged to the best actors and painters ; lowborn musicians , no matter how talented , were people to throw pennies at . There were great lords , great generals , great statesmen , and silly princes were greater than all ; but we had fallen far from the age of Pericles , and there was no great god Apollo . You could as well expect a master physician or scholar to be held great . Anyway , I was completely captivated by Penny Price , and stuck as close to her as I dared . Doubtless I was worshiping her already , that worship warmed and sweetened by dreams of her availability  --  no barrier of ' age between us , or of fortune or birth . Take note of this , any of my posterity who turn out parsons : no loving worship can exist without some such bond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the papists is very near and dear , He is beside them at the Mass , and is warm and breathing , but the God of the Puritans is only a strict schoolmasterwith His desk on high , and so they come to hate Him , and at last to hate , themselves for His making them . I hung on the girl 's words and broke out laughing before getting their point . To my huge joy , handsome Herbert Rutland and impressive Jack Millford did not appear to have too great a head start on me in her regard . Although I watched them withp55gutter-sharp eyes , neither of them gave any sign of being her accepted lover , either by narrow , speaking glances or a studious avoidance of any flirtation . Anyway , if it were true , the lovers would not probably try to hide it , since they were strolling players . A far stranger notion struck me after a few hours of Penny 's company . The present catchword of the taverns , taken from a popular play called The Provoked Wife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a maidenhead at fifteen . " It was applicableenough to the London of my youth , the main exceptions : being the closely guarded daughters of the wealthy , and wenches so plain of face that any charms below the neck were never explored . Penny belonged to neither of these well-protected groups . Indeed , she had known life 's seamy side since she wore pigtails , and was pretty enough to attract a duke . Too , she was a member of a guild that made its own morals . Prudery could not have saved her , because it was her main laughingstock . No joke was too bawdy for her to tell , with the most side-splitting byplay , or to shriek with laughter at , provided its point were keen . Yet I believed her to be a maiden . In the first place , there was something innocent about her very ribaldry . There was no leer in it , only a hearty laugh . A sense of humor may be defined as a keen awareness of man 's kinship with common things . She perceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his existence and many of his parts . Thus she was bound to split her sides over the antics of Respectabilitywhen driven by the most undignified of all desires . Any fall that is not tragic was funny to her  --  this was funnier than an alderman 's on a banana peel . She would see nothing to laugh at in Purdy 's relationship with Mrs. Reynolds , and very little in Annie 's honest and warmhearted amours considering they were no lapse of morals  --  Annie not having any of the polite kind  --  but only in a slapstick stumble from pretentiousness . As a born comedian , Penny knew that the best jokes were those played on prudery . Ii I divined this , without grasping the philosophy behind it ; and also I perceived something in her face and manners that went with a virgin . Wise in such matters before his time was a sprig of seventeen from Poultry . Undoubtedly I was worshiping her , and dreaming dreams about her too , before we reached Ealing . The trouble with this was , the two actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much too good for either Rutland or Millford , how very much too good was she for the company supernumerary and late a pickpocket ! But heroine worship is a wonderful thing for a stripling . We did not play at Ealing . It was too near London for a company without a license . That night we lay in a cheap tavern , Purdy and Mrs. Reynolds having a chamber to themselves , Penny sharing a room with a barmaid , and Herbert Rutlandand I bedding together in a coachman 's room over the stables . I did not know where Annie and Jack Millford slept , not having the effrontery to ask my bedfellow , and he not interested enough in the matter to inform me . It did not seem likely that they had rented two beds when one would do . Just out of Uxbridge , we stopped by the road and put on our best clothes . The main of the Company would now catch the stagecoach for a splendid entry into the town ; and who would drive our lowly cart through the market place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was such a natural choice that I promptly volunteered . It was the least I could do , I thought , for my bright Penny and new friends . In fairness to them , they were reluctant to put off the job on me , at the very beginning of my career as an actor , and part owner in the Company besides . Also , my clothes were new and too good an advertisement for the troupe to waste on the seat of a baggage wagon ; although this difficulty was alleviated by my prompt offer to trade coats and caps for the time being with down-at-heels Jack Millford . Was I repaid for this small sacrifice ? Instantly and tenfold by the bright eyes and warmp57glances of my companions  --  and a hundred times over , I reckoned , by Penny putting her head on one side , as always when she was pleased , and giving me the drollest and most engaging of winks . Perhaps then and there they knew me for a trouper . " I 'll change to the raw with you , Jack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart brimming . " I would n't think of it  --  and anyway the breeches would n't fit . " " Besides , Dick , it 's of value to the Company for you to look well in your temporary post , " Master Purdy told me , his freckled face flushed with feeling . " If our very cart driver looks prosperous and gentlemanly , what must the yokels think of our troupe as a whole ? Why , ' twill spell the difference ' twixt a lean house and a packed ' n . " So upon receiving my instructions , I mounted the cart seat and clucked at the old mare . My friends waited by the road to flag the coach , and I was hardly around the bend when I heard its clatter behind me . I took to the grass as it swung by , the horses loping and snorting for oats , the driver cracking his whip , and the equipage squealing and creaking . My fellow players were being sadly bounced about the benches , but they did not forbear from waving at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baggage contained a painted cloth sign , which a stableboyand I nailed over the door of the inn . It declared that Purdy 's Players and Revelers , straight from a long engagement in London , would tonight perform the latest plays interspersed with comic songs and dances . Also our entire troupe took a stroll through the town in our best clothes , behaving quite like gentry on the whole , although leaving doubt in no townsman 's mind that we were players . We had hardly gained the tavern when a long-faced bailiff , Master Rose , came to confer with Master Purdy , but left cheerful enough , with passes for his cronies and full of ale . Actually he was glad enough to wink at our lack of a license , the love of make-believe embedded so deep in English hearts , and the monotonous life of the market town sadly needinga breach . We were to play in the courtyard of the inn  --  and might God hold back his rain ! Our stage I thought particularly ingenious , although it was an old trick of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hinges and laid flat on oak logs put by for winter fires . Our curtain was hung , our scenery set up , an arrangement made with our host to provide benches for the ready spenders , and all the lanterns and candles we could beg or borrow trimmed and ready . We would start our performanceabout eight , giving the burghers time to finish their day 's work , eat supper , and drink a mug of ale  --  the latter to bring custom to the inn . Although these were long , summer days , we could hardly hope to lower the curtain until black dark . Shortly after seven a few urchins appeared , but none had the groat that children required for entrance . Then some tradesmenlingered about the gate , exchanging jests with Master Purdy ; and when some yokels bought standing room , they did likewise . A bashful swain paid ninepence each for bench seats for himself and his blushing wench , and the bailiff and his friends were bowed to some chairs in arm 's reach of the stage . Their entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small bevy of barmaids and serving wenches from the rival tavern . When this rush slacked off , Annie and Herbert Rutland got it going again by a lively song . Of the first hundred , at least eighty were men and striplings , and all of low or middling degree . True , two young women appearedwearing masks  --  as though they were great ladies at Spring Garden  --  but their disguise was intended to attract attentionrather than conceal their obvious identities , known to every rakehell in the town . Then there came three booted sportsmen , flushed with brandy , undoubtedly country squires and called gentry . If we were able to entertain them , their presence would stick a feather in our cap , and some silver too when we passed it between acts . If we failed , they might entertain themselves byp59catcalling , egg throwing , and other sports enjoyed by London bucks when displeased by a play . Master Purdy nearly burst his breeches , bowing them to chairs , and in spite of his merry jests I knew he was frightened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so after a song or two more , and a comic dance by Master Purdy himself , I raised the curtain and Penny came forth to deliver a homemade prologue . I had never yet seen her perform in costume . To my famished eyes she was almost blinding-bright . In her clear , bubblingvoice she recited : " If you have seen in London town , The play that makes the parson frown , Makes lords and ladies shout with gleeThe Country Wife its title beYou know that Horner  --  gallant blade By our fam 'd Herbert Rutland played  --  Has bade his friend , old Doctor Quack To tell a tale behind his backOf how he 's been a eunuch made , A very capon , it was saidSo honest wife and virtuous maid Need never longer be afraidTo take him to their booths and bowers Where they attended pretty flowers . Within their chambers he could go , Without them shrieking Oh ! Oh ! Ohl ' And now our play will demonstrate The ups and downs of Horner 's fate . But if he is a eunuch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recitation was a great success , and the flattering thrust at the bailiff  --  a " local hit , " in the parlance of the players  --  caused a gale of mirth . A stableboy asked me later how Pennyp6o had found out so soon that long-faced Master Rose was " the gamest cock in Middlesex . " Actually she had had no idea that she was hitting so close home , although Master Purdy was wise after the event , saying that he knew an old rake when he saw one . Then the innocent remarked that it was a good thing the bailiff 's name happened to be Rose , otherwise the line would not have rhymed ! Warmed and eager , our audience received the play well . Of course we gave only the more exciting and daring scenes , bridgingthe gaps with recitations , and interspersed with songs and dances . When after a couple of scenes , Penny and Annie passed tambourines , there was a rain of groats , sixpence , and even shilling pieces , and the three squires , wonderfully affable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a round of kisses from both girls . This so emboldened our ladies that they solicited , with much badinage , the people watching from the windows of the inn , who had hoped to see the show free . Ashamed to be outdone , these dropped silver coins , which the girls caught as neatly as trained seals catch fish . Indeed , our showing in Uxbridge was a real triumph . The audience was attentive and quick to laugh ; not one catcall was heard or an egg or cabbage thrown ; and we had taken in over seven pounds ! It looked to me like trouble when two of the young squires came behind the scenes seeking an intrigue with Penny and Annie ; but they were got rid of with a kiss or two , and a little flattery . Actually it was against the rules of our company for the girls to consort with strange men , or for Herbert , Jack , and me to dally with any townswomen other than acknowledgedstrumpets and public-serving barmaids and the like , the reason not being moral nicety as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could land the lot of us in jail . I do not think that Penny was ever tempted by such invitations , no matter how rich and handsome the giver . The stage was her present world , and her interplay there with others of our company her complete and perfect life . In justice to her , Anniep61did not fret under the restraint . In spite of her hearty appetite for strapping young men , she was a trouper before she was a trollop ; and like all real actors , she regarded outsiders as almost another breed of being , with whom love-making amounted practicallyto miscegenation . I did not yet appreciate the depth of the relationship between her , Jack , and Herbert . I have not yet revealed the greatest admirer of the evening 's entertainment  --  one who laughed the heartiest , clapped the loudest , and was in fact transported with adulation for the entire cast . He was once called Dick Fingers , known among certain guttersnipes as Jerry , and someday he intended to be famed throughout England as Richard Drury . Few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first ; and most fell short of the mark . Many the night we were rained out . We played in towns of sullen , sulky folk  --  God alone knew what had soured them , when their next-village neighbors were blithe as larks  --  who would not come to our show , or , if a few did appear , watched with long , peevish faces . Once we performed before a large throng of what might be turtles , as far as their enjoyment of the play was concerned . They neither applauded nor condemned , merely watched us with codfisheyes , and the players ' lines dropped like leads in somber seas . Occasionally an audience was actively hostile . The people never smiled , only sneered ; they never laughed except with harsh , hard baying when a rotten egg hit the mark ; they hooted and jeered even lovely Penny off the stage , until I wished that they had one throat that I could slit . What did they have against us ? They appeared good folk enough  --  many of them poor as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luckily this was a rare occurrence . Usually when poor people made up their minds to see the show , they paid their groats or sixpence without cavil , perceived we were trying to give them their money's worth , and did their best to get it . Rather it was the young men from the hall and their red-faced , burly , fox-hunting friends whom we mainly feared . It was only good sport for three or four of these would-be gentry to stop the show , cheating a hundred lowly out of their dear-bought pleasure . They would have us know that they were hard to please ! On their visits to London they had seen fine bucks hoot even Kitty Clive off the stage ! It did not count with them that our admission charge was often no more than the price of an orange in the stalls of Drury Lane . If indeed they had paid a higher price than their tenants , it would be argued that they had a larger right to egg us : actually they often refused to pay anything . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gatekeeper , but these same lordlings . On one occasion a half dozen of them forced their way in in the middle of the show , stopped it by catcalls , then demanded that Penny strip to her shift and give them a dance . " Instead I 'll sing for you , " she told them , with a dignity they could not dream . Then while Mrs. Reynolds strummed a lute she began that most beautiful of all love songs , and best fitted to her low , rich soprano : " Drink to Me Only with Thine Eyes . " I do not know what caused her to choose this song , her favorite which so expressed her own dream of beauty : perhaps she thought that no one in human form could hear it unmoved . She was wrong . As the line " But thou thereon didst only breathe " flooded forth from her divine heart , one of the lordlings struck her full on the forehead with a rotten egg , knocking her off her feet and stunning her . He took no harm from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom Purdy stood before us , his eyes burning in his pale face , and forbade us in the name of all that we loved to raise a hand against him . Still I do not believe that the squire and his band took any pleasure in the feat . Not one soul in the audience so much as glanced at them . Each person gazed straight ahead in unutterable shame of their " betters , " and the silencep63hard upon that flood of song was a terrible indictment . One of them , no doubt a lickspittle of the bully , laughed nervously ; and a moment later these shocking distortions of gentlemen left the theater . We revived Penny ; and I , Dick Drury , wiped her face . Thenwe went on with the show . IfAt one market town in Wiltshire we received nine pounds and could scarcely finish the play on account of clapping hands . At the very next , we did not even start it on account of one high , greedy hand . We had prepared to play Love for Love in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , while he could not give us official permission , " what a man do n't know , do n't hurt him . " Our stage scenery was up and most of the players dressed when a swain loitering about the door signaled me behind the building . " ' Ee a-mind to gi ' show tonight ? " he asked . " Yes . " " Hark ' ee , stranger , ' t is naught to me , one way or ' tother , but the young lady spoke to me civil , and I 'd not see her in trouble . " " What is it , friend ? " " Our squire , he own the jail , and he told Mr. Easterbrook to wait till ' ee start ' ee show , then arrest the lot o ' ' ee , and clap ' ee in irons . " " God bless you , for telling me . " " ' T is naught to me . " It was a great deal to us . If we were jailed , with its fees for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out in a matter of months , and some of us might never get out , if jail fever ran rampant . But we wasted no breath or strength protesting the cruel edict . Master Purdy instantly took command , cool and resourceful as any captain on the field of battle ; and in truthI loved and revered that freckled little man as never before . 1After giving us our orders , he and Penny went to the loading platform of the building and began to beat on tambourines.  | When they had attracted every loiterer about , Jack Millford sped to the inn after our cart and horse , while Herbert , Mrs. Reynolds , and Annie began peeling off their costumes as though they were on fire . As I started to dismantle the stage  --  having only a bit part , I had not yet dressed  --  I heard Master Purdy 's arresting , stentorian voice : " Ladies and gentlemen , do n't reach in your pockets . We do n't want and wo n't accept a penny for what you 're about to hear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we hope if you 're pleased with the sample , you 'll eat the whole cake tonight , when the doors open . This way , ladies and gentlemen . Speaking of pennies , this is our leading songbird and romantic star , Miss Penny Price . Penny , what have I here ? " " Why , it looks like a penny , " the girl answered in her clear voice . " Now you see it  --  and now you do n't . " That time-honored trick to turn grownups into children ! Stark naked and innocent of it , my friends were throwing their costumes into the chests . Leaping into their traveling clothes , they helped me take down and stack the scenery . When Jack drove the cart to the rear door , a hilarious dance on the platform drowned out the noise of loading on the baggage . Then Master Purdy appeared in the paltform doorway , bowing and frolicking . I saw him framed there , very Scaramouch , as he tossed a cue to Penny ; then as her lilting voice broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The freckles stood out like grains of sawdust on his pale face . " Dick , you know the cues of her milkmaid song ? " " Perfectly , sir . " " Go out and gi " em to her , as soon as she finishes this turn . Then in the roughhouse part , whisper to her to cut the song short and meet us at Martin 's Mill . " " Yes , sir . " " You 're the youngest and liveliest man . Hold ' em as much longer as you can  --  half an hour if you 're able  --  then fetch ap65circle onto the Andover Road . We 'll make west , as for Devizes , and ' 11 be seen and followed , but do n't let ' em see you , and we 'll cut back at the first lane , to meet you at St. Mary Bourne , over the Hampshire border . " So I went out on the platform and did ritualistic monkeyshinesbefore some score of louts . During her milkmaid act , I had no trouble in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danced toward the door . " I 'll be back , kind sir , " she said aloud , " and we 'll go a-milking together . " With that she vanished within the building and I thought I would not see her again , short of St. Mary Bourne . So I mimicked her like a clown , meanwhile wondering what under heaven I could say or do to hold the yokels even ten minutes , let alone half an hour . I had no voice for singing , in fact could hardly carry a tune , and a jig without music soon palls . I was afraid to give them the bawdy imitations that were my only forte  --  two or three country girls were in the small crowd , and a long-faced clerk of some kind  --  and although I had learned many roles by rote , they were meaningless without dialogue and interplay . But I had hardly finished mimicking Penny and had started to tell one of Purdy 's jokes when I was nearly knocked off the platform by a kick in my behind . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveling clothes and with a milk bucket in her hand . How lovely , how brave , and how true ! The fear went out of my heart , and glory  --  provided an ex-guttersnipe could recognize the symptoms  --  came in ; because fate had given me this chance to support her in one of the most exacting and critical performancesof her career . That support was far better too than she had any reason to expect from a tyro actor , unless I had caught inspiration from her I did not know why . It came to me that we would not be able to hold that small , haphazard crowd with slapstick and farce : that these would soon turn sour and silly . Anyway they were not Penny 's forte . So it seemed without her guidance , I began to cue her for her best songs , with only a little badinage between . After another verse of her rather rowdy milkmaid song , she went to popular airs and then romantic ballads , the sweetest that she knew . For at least twenty minutes we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the soaring melodies , they did not hear the creaking wheels of our cart as the flight of the Company began ; but I heard it in exultation , for she and I were holding the gate together , and then that beautiful being would be in my care for an indefinite period to come . Thereafter the rustics began to grow restless , not because our show was petering out , more because of its very excellence . They had never in their lives heard such singing as Penny afforded them , a perplexing fact at this time and place . Since the show was free , it had ought to be poor and short , they thought , but when they tried to behold it as such , the golden sand continued to run out and they heard that golden song in spite of themselves . " What 's a-going on ' ere ? " they asked themselves and , inaudibly yet , one another . Penny sang one more song that they could not choose but hear . It was " Dream of Me Tonight , " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a humor more touching than tears , and told me she could not sing any more  --  that those were all the songs she knew . " Anyhow , I a' n't coom now milked of Bossy , " she told me wistfully , in an utterly faithful imitation of the Wiltshire dialect that no pen can reproduce . " Then it 's time to pass the hat , " I said . " Mr. Dick , ' ee a' n't no head-gear on ' ee , nor no more ha ' I. " " Then we 'll go in and borrow one from Master Purdy . His is a big'n . " So , promising to return in a few minutes and take up a collection , both of us left the platform . Of course we never set foot there again . Hand in hand we scooted out a rear door into an alley , around the corner of a blacksmith shop , and from there in a general southerly direction toward Andover Road . Few of thep67crowd waited very long , I reckon  --  the majority finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed  --  but there may have been a handful who were ashamed to go , and perhaps one who had resolved that we were worthy of our hire and who stuck there , in English fashion , to pay his debt or be damned . It might have been the deathblow to his honesty , to learn at last that the whole caboodle of us had flew the coop . Keeping to lonely lanes and avoiding passers-by , Penny and I made our way into the country . Since both of us were plainly dressed , we were not likely to attract attention . Nor for the moment were we uneasy about the future , being so pleased with ourselves over our performance , the kind of experience that troupers live over again and again and love to recount , being so illustrative of our fly-by-night existence . But as the shadows grew longer , Penny kept glancing over her shoulder . We had conspiredto break the law , even if we had not broken it , and that too was a felony for all we knew , so rigorous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event it was not good to anger a country squire . " Do n't be afraid , Penny , " I told her . " All right , Dick . " " I 'll take care of you the best I can . " " I 'm so glad you 're with me . " It was no little heaven to me ; Penny the loveliest person I had ever known . I would die tonight rather than let her come to real harm . I told myself so , and it was no vain heroics . Shifty though I was raised to be , with the smell of the gutter-rat upon me , willing to make almost bargain for mere breath , tonight I had my banner and my spurs . Tonight I was trustee of somethinggreater than the sum total of my self-interest . There was nothing to laugh at in that consecration . I did not wish that we might meet footpads , that I could save her and win her love : my dearest hope was to keep her from all trouble . It was a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor Master Purdy or I had thought of money . He owed me over two pounds in back wages , and one of my two gold guineas was still sewed in my best coat  --  the other having melted away in a hot and hungry time we had the preceding month  --  but in my pocket was only one groat and a few pennies . Penny , it appeared , had only a sixpence on her , and that was a crooked one  --  like Mother Goose 's found by a crooked stile  --  which she kept for a good-luck piece . This meant that we could not stay at a respectable inn , provided we came upon one in this darkling time upon this lonely road . We walked beside hayfields from which the reapers were all gone , and by pastures where milk cattle stood still and dreary , perhaps wondering at their emptied bags where no calf had sucked . There were heaths too , taking us a weary time to pass , so forsaken were they save by the massing shadows and the loiteringwind of night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had strayed from New Forest in the south and could not find their way back . When we went into the shadow , we paced quickly , our hands tight-clasped . We were afraid of the silence and more afraid to make sound . It is no wonder that our wise , simple forefathers worshiped in the wood . Standing so still for so many years , high above men 's heads , in intercourse only with the wind in their boughs and the washing rain and loving sunlight and the chilling fog , it seems natural that trees should become otherworldly , and that good and evil spirits should dwell in them . It became full night . It was clear and perfect for those who sat in doorways  --  balmy and star-festooned  --  but too awesome and vast for a pair of homeless wanderers . The moon would not rise until after midnight . We climbed starward on little hills , then dipped with dread into dark vales . We passed cottages alreadydark , and others with solitary glimmering windows , andp69once the iron gates of a mansion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us weep with their tenderness and sweet strains . God knew I had no business mingling my magpie voice with hers , and sang very softly so I could listen to her and took studied care to make no discords , but when I fell altogether silent she could not go on , unable to weave that magic web in the vast hollow of night . Some of the songs were bawdy , to keep us from being too sad , and perhaps to enbolden us , I know not how . We crossed a bridge over a murmuring , star-glimmered river , and then we heard the distant drum of horses ' feet on the sunbakedroad . Quickly we climbed a roadside hedge and lay in the grass of the meadow : even so , we were hardly hidden when three shapes blacker than the night loomed over us , so fast those horsemenrode on their unknown mission . They were swallowed up , and soon the wild rhythm of fleet hoofs died clean away . But Penny did not yet stir under my arm that beyond my knowledge had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark , Dick , " she murmured . She was telling me something secret and important . Her imagination that could re-create her in the wink of an eye to a beggar maid , a queen , a country slut , or a London drab could also people the darkness with shapes of terror . She loved life with an unslaked passion , her own life so dearly as to love all breathing things ; and the hollowness and silences of night seemed to her like death . Although I did not tell her so , I was at least uneasy on the dark , empty road . Actually it was safe as heaven compared to the stinking alleys of London that I had often threaded through in the pitch-dark , but their perils I understood and could try to combat , while this fragrant witchery was unknown . " I 'll take care of you , " I told her . " Then let 's stay here all night . We could n't find a better hiding place . "  | " No , the grass is damp , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths . " " Then let 's find a haycock . It wo n't be the first time I 've slept in one . It 'll keep us warm and dry . " " No , we 've got to go on a while longer . It 's a long way to St. Mary Bourne and our friends will travel all night and be waiting for us . " " But they 're taking a long way ' round  --  and I ca n't travel much farther . " " Then we 'll stop at the first lighted cottage . " We came to one about two miles down the road . No dogs barked as we approached the gate , and the unshuttered window would give me a good chance to reconnoiter . I would not likely misread the signs . For once since knowing Penny I was glad of my gutter-raising , because my hard-taught knowledge of evil would help to protect her from it . Footpads and highwaymen often holed up in such cottages as this ; indeed , many with branded hands had been driven to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bestial from beast labor and solitude . But there were no burly , red-faced brutes drinking at a table , no hard-lipped rats in corners . I had hardly glanced into the cottage 's single room before knowing that fortune had befriended us tonight . Two candles burned in the sparsely furnished hut  --  and it is always a good sign when folk are liberal with tallow . Beside one a small , gray-bearded man sat reading from a big , brown book , steel-rimmed spectacles on his blunt nose , and the track of tong years ' kindnesses on his chubby face . In the glimmer of the other  --  and even the candlelight looked friendly instead of sinister , as sometimes it seems at night  --  a medium-tall , slender woman of about the same age was fitting together little panels of wood to make a many-celled frame . In a moment I knew that this was to go in a beehive . Unless I missed my guess the two old people were beekeepers . According to English folklore , bees will not stay wherep7Ithere is hating . Certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swarms than nervous , irritable folk : I suppose that keeping bees requires a great deal of patience . The clean , neatly patched clothes of the old couple as well as the orderly room told as much more of their sweet story as Penny and I need know . I tiptoed back to her and took her hands and in an overflow of happiness , kissed her . " It 's all right , " I told her . " We can go in . " " Do you think we can spend the night ? " " I 'm sure of it . I 'll tell them you 're my sister . " " No , say we 're married . That 's safer and cheaper . " " I 'll leave that to you . " So we came talking up the little walk  --  so not to take the old pair too much by surprise  --  and knocked at the door . " Who be there ? " the old fellow called . " A boy and a girl , and we 've lost our way , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever shaped itself into a play in her heart and mind . " Open the door , Silvester , " the old woman said . It was opened , and the candlelight , and some other kind of light that their lives gave forth , poured out to us . " Why , ' t is deedy just a younker , and a pretty lass , " the gaffer told his wife in beaming joy . Then , turning to us : " Ye two be lost ye say ? " " We know we 're on Andover Road but it 's too dark to travel much further . " " I do agree wi ' ye ! Away and away too dark and dreary , to be out on the long road . Come in the instant . " We did so , with bursting hearts ; and the old woman put down her work and , coming close to us , peered into our faces . Plainly she was nearsighted . " A likely lad , and a fair comely maid , " she pronounced . " I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband cried.  | " And where might the pair o ' ye be going , this dark night ? " It was not prying , only the kindest concern . " We 've run away together , " Penny answered . " Why , bless me . Silvester , did ye e'er hear the like ? " " That I never . " " Ye 're new married , or else fixing to be , when ye get to the parson ? " " Well  --  " Penny was having trouble with her lines . " Do n't pin ' em down no close'n ' at , Marthy , " Silvester broke in . " Whether or no they 've found the parson yet , ye can see wi ' half an eye they 're honest lovers . " " Well I know it , " Marthy replied . " You 're on the young side , but ' t is better so , for a well-matched couple . And what might your names be ? " " I 'm Dick Drury , and this is Penny Price , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes , or did ye put ' em on to run away in ? To deal plain , ye look like Quality to me . " " No , ma'am , we 're middling poor folk , " Penny replied , her eyes big and bright in the candlelight . I wondered if that admissioncame hard . Bright-dreamed Penny could have woven a wonderful tale , faster than her lilted words could tell it , of how two young lovers , nobly born , had been separated by greedy guardians , and had disguised themselves as a country wench and swain in order to flee their mansion-prisons and unite their loves  --  and she could almost believe it too . If she had left it to me , I do not believe that I could have kept from hinting at least that we were different than we seemed . However , I was proud of Penny as never before . Although I could not have explained the fineness of that admission in our present fix , it was what I might have expected from this highhearted girl . She was highborn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could understand , and the king 's rolls did not reveal . It was heaven to love someone like her . " ' T is God 's mistake then , " remarked Silvester . " He do n't mean to blaspheme , " Marthy explained sweetly.  | " He means that some who ought to live in palaces are born in huts , and vicy-versy . But in all case e'en a cottage like this beats the dark road . " " It 's God 's truth , " I said . " Ye ca n't go on till daylight , and that 's sure . " " We 'll sleep on the floor gladly , and pay you what we can for the shelter . " " No , yell not ! A bridegroom and a bride  --  tomorrow if not tonight  --  sleep on the floor ! I 'd not hear o ' it , or neither would Silvester . " " That I 'd not , " said her husband stoutly . " What of that bed in the corner ? ' T is not o'er hard  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and cleaner than many a bed in a fine tavern . " " Where would you two sleep ? " Penny asked . " Ye need n't worry about us . We call this the beehouse , for we keep the frames here , and take care o ' the honey , but we sleep here only on nights we work late . We share a cottage with our boy and his wife on most nights  --  and ' t is only a five-minute walk on a well-worn path . " " If we could pay you for your trouble  --  " I began . Since I was the only one here who was not gentry by divine right , I knew no better . " We want no Biller , " Silvester told me . " ' T is enough , that we 've had a hand in starting ye on your way . " " Bless 'd Jesus keep you ever , " Penny cried , tears in her eyes . They took us to a well behind the cottage where we washed off our travel dust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so not to soil the sheets on the clean bed , when Marthy brought us a washrag to sponge off ourselves a little in the dark . " It 's a' n't fitten for a bride and groom not to be clean , and smell sweet , " Marthy told us in her motherly way . Nor did the solicitous well-wishers leave us yet . " Marthy , I 'll wager ye a turnip , they ai n't had supper ! " Silvester exclaimed  | " Oh , we 're not hungry  --  " Penny replied . " We had something about four , " I said , " and could n't eat a bite . " " ' T is a long time from four to ten on the long road , " Silvesterremarked . " Marthy 'll go to the cottage and cook ye something , but if ye was beekeepers ye 'd make a better meal on something else . " " I do n't know what you mean . " " I do n't mean kisses either , though them 's good food for young ' ns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under sun . " " And that 's right handy too , " Marthy told us , with glowing eyes . She pointed to a covered crockery pitcher , surrounded by some old china teacups , on a shelf . " Strained honey ? " Penny asked . " No , miss , " Silvester answered very slowly . " Mead . " I wish that all those who deny the poetry of life and the dignity of man could have heard his pronunciation of that word . It was more than a word to him : it was a symbol of his and Marthy 's triumph over poverty and travail ; in it was their pride in an exacting craft ; it represented the finest fruits of the beeman'sharvest . They had mead in that jar . Mead was made from honey and the word was synonymous with reward . They could drink mead when they felt like it and offer it to their guests . " ' T is a fitten drink for a bride and groom , " Marthy told us with pride finer than a prince 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taverns ever had it , and at a price beyond my purse . When Silvester took down the jar and four teacups , and poured the fragrant fluid gold , it was one of the witching moments of my life . " The pair o ' ' em drink together first , " Marthy told her husband . So Penny and I , our eyes meeting and speaking what we did not understand , raised our cups and touched them . It was mead in the goblets , which dull , petty folk will tell you is a mere beekeeper 's , peasant drink , not very common but not veryp75expensive either , but I think that Apollo drank it before he waked his lyre , and Venus ere she stole from Vulcan 's bed to meet her radiant lovers . As for a London pickpocket , it exalted his soul . " Now ye must kiss , with your lips still wet with mead , " Marthy prompted . " ' T is wondrous tasting that way , ai n't it ? " Silvester asked in a gentle voice when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest o ' it , Marthy . " " I do n't know as I remember how it goes , " she replied shyly . " As though ye 'd ever forget ! " " Then , Dick , ye say to Penny  --  or sing it to her , if ye can catch the tune "  --  and then with her sweet , thin old voice breaking into song : " Sweet as honey , loving as mead , You shall be my queen indeed . " When I repeated the lines the best I could , she turned to Penny . " Now , Penny , ye sing to Dick , " Flowers unplucked will wither soon , Eat my honey with a spoon . " Penny looked at me , and opening that lovely mouth that had just kissed me , out came a brimming river of song , magically flooding the room ; and I thought my backbone would unhinge . " Now ye 're good as married , vicar or no , " Silvester told us . " He means , ' t is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , them that kept bees was like a guild , their children taking after ' em , and they had little customs of their own , and this was one of ' em , when a swain and a lass set up for ' emselves . Doubtless the priest blessed ' em too , but they did n't feel it binding , till the Bee-Bride 's Song was sung . " Then both old people drank to our health and happiness , I and Silvester kissed Penny , and Marthy kissed both of us . Then , telling us to make free with the jar of mead , but warning us that " ' t was wondrous clever liquor , getting next to ye ' fore ye knew it , " they bade us good night . Penny and I were left alone in the candlelight . We both knew , without knowing quite why , that we had just undergone a great experience , memorable and significant throughout our lives . The scene was instinct with it  --  this meagerly furnished cottage beside the road , poor and plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . Penny was looking at the jewellike flame of one of the candles , her head a little on one side , her watermeloncoloredmouth faintly smiling , the smooth flesh about her high cheekbones having a lustrous look , her Roman-gold hair rich beyond price , her skin very rosy . She was a good armful of a girl , I rejoiced . I thought of kissing her full lips to my content , and then her bold , young breasts , but I could not contemplate more than that , the pain of it was too intense . Perhaps our great adventure had only begun . Presently Penny turned to me , her eyes not quite meeting mine , a half-exultant , half-awed look on her face . " Dick . " " Yes . " " Say , does it seem to you  --  I suppose it 's just my imagination  --  that we are  --  really  --  married ? " Her wary tone was like that used by a sober man to his crony in a taproom , asking if he had just seen a tall young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disappear into thin air . Actually such a notion had been flitting about my mind , but I had not let it perch there , being such an unbelievable bird . Now I dared look at it straight . " Yes , Penny . " " You see  --  it would be just the kind of marriage I 'd want . The ordinary kind , with ministers and parish records , are awkwardfor actors and actresses : we ca n't be sure of being togetherp77from one play to another , let alone whole seasons  --  and it 's so easy to fall in love on the road . That 's why most players who want to live together do n't marry . Yet I would n't want to start out with a man I love without any rite at all . " She did not expect me to reply , so I did not . She sat down on a bench by the table and soon her voice rippled through the room again . " When Marthy had us go through that little ceremony , it seemed to me just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed . It had the sun in it , and summer , and flowers that bloom and wither . I suppose that 's why I got the queer feeling of  --  getting married . " " I wish you wanted to count it a real marriage , " I said , my voice trembling . She looked at me straight now , and I thought that her blue eyes were getting bigger . " Dick  --  do you ? " " Good God . " " Are you  --  sure ? " " With all my heart . But I know there is n't a chance that you  --  " " Yes , I do too  --  if you do . I mean the ceremony part . But the rest might not come for a long time yet  --  maybe never . " " Do you mean it , Penny ? " " It would be a wonderful bond between us , Dick . No one to know about it yet  --  we being a real bride and groom , standing by each other  --  maybe learning to love each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you now , Penny . " It was true : such a simple and yet tremendous discovery . I had only adored her until then . " I want to love you too , Dick , but it has n't gone that far yet . And it 's got to grow itself , like a good play  --  not be lost in passion . It 's a wonderful thing to look forward to . " " Wonderful . " That was all my poor tongue could utter.  | " We 're both so young . We need n't be in a hurry . Barely eighteen yet  --  but you 're older than I am in so many ways . " " That 's because of the life I 've lived . " I would tell her about it soon . " Heavens , I 'm tired ! Let 's go to bed . " " All right . I 'll sleep on the floor . " " No . " " What ? " " We 'll sleep together tonight . It 's our wedding night . You wo n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want me to . " " Even if I do  --  from just nature  --  do n't . Will you promise me that ? " " I promise . " " You 're strong , Dick . I felt that from the very first . You can be stronger still , when you have something great to live for  --  as I live for the stage . I do n't want you to pick my flower tonight  --  inthe words of that song . It would be a sad defeat for me . If you 'll fight for me , not against me , it will be a great victory for us both . " " I 'll protect you , Penny . " " Keep to what I tell you now  --  not what I might tell you tonight . All right , Dick . " She blew out the candles , and a moment later I heard thebed rustle and creak under her weight . Naked save for underbreeches , for the night was mild , I crept in beside her , and whenI threw out my arm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was wearing her shift , but it was only a slightbarrier to her yearning breasts , and their sweet points sprung firmagainst my side . Now one careless movement of her hand alongmy body would have brought about the breaking of our bond . She did not kiss me good night . I ached for her to , with amammoth and almost unbelievable aching , but I dared not hopethat she would , for that too would have meant I would fail her . Of course we should not have subjected ourselves to such anp79ordeal . It was trial by fire . It was torture of a kind , and torture is an effective means to make men and women break faith with all that they love and believe . Nature exacts subtly cruel revenge on those who defy her in honor 's name ! But we were too young to know the sadness of it , and it was splendid in its way . I could hear her rapid , shallow breaths , and could not conceal my own . I felt her heart drumming my side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was warm and silken ; her hair gave forth sweet scent ; I could not stir without a new contact of our bodies , each exquisite and convulsing my chest to its utter depth ; her breasts , although so young , crept a little with our breathing , yielded a little to my male firmness , seeking to make us break our pledge  --  and keep the Bee-Bride 's Words . Penny tried to sing to me , but her voice failed . After an hour or more , sheer exhaustion eased her pain . I felt her breaths grow long and peaceful : she had fallen asleep . This was a dangerous time for me , a gutter-devil , used to taking my prey by stealth . One little transgression now  --  in the agony of longing in which I lay and in the trustful sleep in which she lay  --  would have unmanned my walls . I did not pray to God for strength . To my great loss , he seemed to me the God of the nobility and gentry , of fine and rich folk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all my will power , an old man who had played a fiddle . He had loved me and desired my soul to thrive . Sometime soon thereafter I too dropped off , sleeping fitfully . But I floated barely under the surface of that strange tide , and came wide awake when the late-rising moon looked through the window . We had drawn no sheet over us , on account of the warm weather , and I did not do so yet . Penny 's head had slipped from my shoulder and was on the thick of my arm , also she had turned to lie more on her back . Very softly I withdrew my arm , saying to myself that it might be causing her discomfort , and there was some truth in it . But Ip8o could not forbear , when it was free , from softly sitting up to look at her . Her shift had slipped down on one shoulder , revealing the swell of her breast . It was too beautiful in the moonlight for me to stand , but what I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With fingers so light that they could lift a purse from a bailiff 's pocket , I cleared the way a little more and touched my lips to its crimson . One other kiss I stole , Venus triumphing that far over Vesta . But save for those two little compromises , in an agony of enchantment , I kept my vow.  |p81ON  FIRST WAKING UP IN THE MORNING , I did not know where Iwas . The events of the night seemed fantastic as dreams . Even seeing Penny lying beside me was more like a tale of Arabian Nights than of a Hampshire road in summer . Then , half awake , she had given me a smile , instantly reassuring me of the bright reality of our adventure . There was no regret in that smile , no belittling of what was between us , not the slightest recantation . Happiness came washing over me in an extravagant tide . That tide did not ebb that I could notice all the way to St. Mary Bourne , because Penny swam in it with me . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough touched to share my exuberant joy . We walked part of the way , our delight in each other overflowing every little incident and pretty scene along the road . We rode awhile on a haywagon , half buried in the fragrant crop , yet gazing lordly over the countryside . Finally we gave a yokel a groat for a lift on his wool cart , without having our high spirits bounced and shaken out of us . I had never seen the sky so blue or the grass such a lively green . " What shall we tell the others ? " I asked , when we were in sight of the church steeple . " The truth  --  except about us being married . " " I better leave it to you , Penny . " Oddly enough , we had never questioned but that the Companywould be waiting for us . Perhaps we thought it would never rain save when we could hear its music from under cozy eaves . Before we could sober ourselves up , I saw our old brown mare picketed in a meadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our friends had had no trouble . Gleefully they recited their journey of the night , Master Purdy and the two women in the cart , Herbert and Jack buying a ride on a latetravelingpig wagon , and no smell of the foiled squire . They had arrived about dawn , made up some lost sleep , and arranged for a show tonight . It was the happiest of reunions . " How did you make out , Penny darling ? " Annie inquired , when the others ' news was told . Annie 's eyes were bright and , in a kind way , sharp . I knew what she was thinking and no doubt hoping too , not because guilt loves company  --  anyway Annie was guiltless as a young ewe in season  --  but from sheer amiability . Annie was never greedy . She wanted everyone to have a good time . I noticed too that at her question a pregnant silence fell . Mrs. Reynolds looked smiling at the sky . Master Purdy 's face reddened , not from embarrassmentGod wot  --  he was as wholesouled a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather from emotion . Herbert and Jack , the best of friends , winked at each other . Perhaps one or both of them had hoped for Penny 's favors , but they were not dogs in mangers . She was eighteen now . Flowers unplucked will wither soon was part of the players ' as well as beekeepers ' philosophy , although more coarsely and bluntly expressed . Both men liked me too , and since Penny and I were in the way of being the heroes of the Company 's escape from disaster , an adventure of love between us during our flight struck them as being dramaticand thus imminently desirable . " We made out all right , did n't we , Dick ? " Penny replied , her head a little on one side . " We certainly did , " I answered . " What are we going to think from that ? " Annie persisted . " You do n't have to look so damned smug , you two , " Jack Millford broke in . " An old couple who keep bees let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told them , airily . " Well , did you get plenty of honey ? " Annie asked  | " Or was Dick stung  --  by the bees ? " Humorless Herbert had surpassed himself . " We had a nice bed , " Penny said with sudden dignity . " Dick was a gentleman . " " It depends on what you mean by a gentleman , " Annie said . " If it had been me  --  " " You know what I mean . Dick was wonderful , and do n't get any wrong idea in your head . " " I believe you , baby , " said Master Purdy . " All I can say is , he would n't have behaved that way if it had been me , " Annie persisted , a true word spoken in jest . " I would n't have let him . " That closed the subject . I do not see how it could have been handled more sensibly and pleasantly  --  with a little smile , a little seriousness , a little coarseness , and a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present intimate relationships . Discussion of it could not have been avoided , in our close group of frank-speaking players : it did not strike anybodyas the least immoral . Others might think differently , even in our rowdy age . By the most tolerant observers , players were considered a liberal lot , more strait-laced people called them lewd . Their plays were usually ribald , often gross . Knowing very well its dangers to their laws  --  and the strollers were even more lax than the London companies  --  the Puritans had closed the theater during the Commonwealth . Tom Purdy 's Players and Revelers were the direct heirs of those earlier gypsies . We lived about the same kind of lives . There was a moral code among-players , and it was reasonablywell-kept by our troupe . But the mother of morals , as of invention , is necessity . Indeed , where moral codes do not provide convenient sexual , romantic , and economic relations between men and women , those codes will invariably give way to others . Polygamy was not common among players , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Polyandry was rather more frequent . one actress playing the role of wife to two or more actors . The usual thing was deep attachments between couples , kept with notable fidelity until time and circumstance caused their dissolution . And just as the primary purpose of public morals is for civilized life to go on  --  such things as family and property rights preserved  --  the primary purpose of players ' morals was for the show to go on . In our company , Annie was the sweetheart of both Herbert and Jack . They shared her favors at convenient times with completeequanimity and not a trace of jealousy . All were rightfully concerned as to whether Penny and I struck it off , and not merely for friendship 's sake . A union between us two would bind all closer . It might conceivably cause Penny to be more contented and less likely to leave the troupe in favor of some other ; and Mrs. Reynolds had often told her that she would become a better actress if physically and emotionally satisfied . But whether she went through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not matter to them in the least . Thus in many respects , Penny 's and my affair promised to be typical of players ' lives . If it were florid , often melodramatic , sometimes shocking to conventional good taste , so was the whole existence of us wandering barnstormers , without money , withoutsocial position , with the sheriff at our ragged coattails , and our souls dedicated to the stage . If it failed to be typical it would be on the genteel side . I had come from a dirty world  --  in odious comparison with this fantastic pagan world  --  but Penny 's beauty of mind and spirit raised her above the frequent indecencies and real grossness of her environs . Our friends had believed her account of our road adventure , but knew there was more to it than she revealed . In the ensuing weeks , they must have been greatly puzzled as to our relationship . We were the closest of companions . Each became the other 's champion in everything . We spent almost every waking hour in each other 's company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not holding hands , our eyes were meeting and speaking . Of more consequence than any of these to the welfarep85of the Company , Penny was trying her best to make an actor of me . Until lately I had been given only bit parts , obviously being unequal to anything better . I could do a gymnastic dance and a few ribald imitations , and was a first-rate scene shifter and handy man . Now Penny began to take most of her spare time tutoring me for character and supporting parts . If she succeeded , we would have a cast of seven instead of six , considerably broadeningthe scope of our performance . Surely , if slowly , she was succeeding . I would never be a Colley Cibber or a Barton Booth , but she was teaching me the tricks of the theater if not its art . I was learning to handle myself better on the stage  --  to have more " presence "  --  to speak lines much better  --  even to get a little inkling of that mysterious bond between playwright , actor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . But my goal was not stage success , of itself . It was not the welfare of the troupe or the love of the players ' profession . It was only the love  --  and to make myself more worthy  --  of Penny Price . She had once told me that if I had something great to live for  --  as she had the stage  --  I would be more of a man . Now I did have something great to live for . And it did seem to be making me more of a man  --  certainly more of a player . She did not love me yet , or if she did , she was not aware of it . The root of our powerful and ever-strengthening relationshipwas my adoring love for her , which her heart could not help but echo with a deepening tone . Mine was a marvelous thing . Probably few men of mature and balanced mind would be capable of it . I could not have poured it out , as the seasons changed , save for the long and ugly hunger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a curiously humble love , grateful for any requital she made , although not content with less than all . I wanted to spend my money on clothes , to shine for her , but could not because I must buy her little gifts . I never lifted a cup of ale without toasting her in my thoughts . I never went to sleep save thinking of her , and never wakened but that I was dreaming of her . I wrote poetry to her  --  poorly rhymed and lamely footed , but so wildly passionate that I can not recall it even now without emotion . When we were apart , I felt dismemberedin something quite like pain . Hardly a night passed that I did not rise in its black middle to make sure that all was well with her . If I could not sleep in her bed , I would have liked to lie at the foot of it , like a dog . It would seem a poor condition for winning a young girl'slove . You would think she would be flattered , but seek moredifficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least hergenius needed my adoration . Since then I have found a saying that explains this . Rather it is a secret , stealthily whispered , becausemen are not supposed to know it ; it is something spiedupon on high , perhaps what great Jove told Wotan wanderinglike a ghost among the rubble of Valhalla ; whether I have everheard it or read it or if it is the inkling of my soul I do not know . When they have no more worshipers , even the great gods die . But if I had not been attractive to Penny in other ways , my applause would not have meant so much to her . It would have been only flattering , not vital nourishment . There my strong , young body stood me in good stead . Because it evoked powerful responses from her young body , she put an exaggerated value on everything about me , especially my opinion of a young actress . By the same token she respected my mental gifts and was emotionally excited over my starved childhood . Strangely enough , I had not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high courage I have never been able to decide . However , when I confided to her that I was an orphan of unknownparentage , her own imagination furnished a better tale . " You 're wellborn , Dick , I know , " she said . " I think high-born. "  | " There 's no proof of that , " I answered , to hear more . " The proof 's in the way you look , and talk , and all the instincts of a gentleman , now you 've got away from those terribleslums , and are beginning to find yourself . I 'm only the daughter of a poor schoolmaster , but probably you 're the son of a lord ! " High color was stealing into her face . " If so , he abandoned me . A bastard , most like  --  " " No , I think you 've good blood on both sides . Why , you could easily be a changeling ! " Penny had once played a changelingin a bombastic old drama . Then I ached to repeat Fiddling Fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of coach wheels on the cobblestones , the silken swaddling and the ring with its noble crest ; but my throat tightened , and I could not . " You may be the real heir of a dukedom , " she went on , almost singing . " Some scheming kinsman of your father  --  or maybe a servant  --  stole you from your cradle and put his own baby in your place . Your mother had probably died at your birth , or she would have discovered the plot . Probably the man intended you to be killed . The person he told to do it could n't be quite that wicked , and put you on Fiddling Fingers ' door . Maybe it was n't even in England  --  but France , or Holland . " " It can never be proved . " " Probably not . You may die without knowing who you are . But perhaps someday  --  when you 're a famous actor  --  you 'll meet some old nobleman whom you 'll be instinctively drawn to  --  the same as in The Lost Heir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that do happen . " I was so drunk with love of her that I regarded them as quite common . " Anyway , you 've got gentle blood in your veins . " It was rather an anticlimax , but the curtain of her little play was ringingdown . When she saw my face falling too , she seized both my hands . " I 'm sure of it , Dick , " she went on , with intense conviction . " If we knew your story , it might be stranger than anything we can imagine . And I know you 're going to be a famous actor . " My suit prospered from the incident , and life being what it is , I made more capital from a happening on the stage a few weeks later . In what was perhaps the most important role yet given me , I supported Penny in a sparkling scene the climax of which was a stolen kiss . In rehearsal I had played my part as directed , giving her only a peck , but at the first performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the job as her true lover . It was a bolder act than one might think . Master Purdy was always reminding us " to speak only what is set down . " While he aimed mostly at Jack Millford , who reckoned himself an impromptu playwright , I was so in awe of all things theatrical that I had never dared lift an unauthorized finger on the stage . What had inspired me , I think , was first the notable success of the scene up to this point . The audience was not merely attentive : I could feel their delight washing up like sunlit waves on a golden beach ; their laughter was so happy it was almost loving . This itself did not intoxicate me . Well I knew that Penny was the star and I her mere satellite . Although she was feeding me all my role could stand , which in all but the greatest actresses is like pulling their teeth , tonight it seemed only to fatten rather than bleed her own part . But at least I was reflecting back some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wondrous , mystical , beautiful it seemed beyond my sense , I loved her inordinately and must show I did . The passionate , possessive kiss startled her , of course , and also it ignited her . With an instant grasp of theater , she revealed her emotions to the audience . She looked at me , her lips parted , her eyes big , her color appearing to grow ; and there was not a sound from the throng . Then there came an explosion of applause , the kind that an audience can not help but give , their hands clapping convulsively , and everyone exclaiming . " Kiss her again , matey , and she 's your'n , " a big voice shouted.  |p89Half  of that outburst was for me . No , the whole of it was both of us as a team . I had not achieved any fine acting , but I had done what the audience wanted me to do  --  expressed in a way satisfactory to them their mass enamorment of Penny . Because she was so lovely in a lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the play . Not one of our company failed to rejoice at the triumph and all were resolved to capitalize on it . While Herbert and Annie held the crowd with a romantic song , the others hastily changed the following , final scene of the script to prevent an anticlimax and strengthen the action between Penny and me . Although my performance thereafter was by no means brilliant , the audience was so friendly to me , and Penny so glowing and engaging , that the show ended amid cheers . For long afterward that particular play was to be one of our mainstays , and my role in it the most important in my modest repertoire . Indeed , the little success made a better actor of me  --  less self-conscious and wooden , more sympathetic and lifelike . But the sweetest tribute was given me immediately after the show . Penny looked at me with such luminous eyes that I asked her for a tryst . I thought my heart would smother before she replied , for God only knew the trepidation of my kind of love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet her at the postern gate of the innyard in an hour . That was a strange and wonderful hour . The time ran , and in some strange way appeared to stand still , perhaps because I wanted it to fly , to bring my sweet to me , but feared that an evil fate might prevent her coming . No one must know of the rendezvous . This was implied by our whispering and stealthy gestures . Neither of us knew any good reason for secrecy , but both the poetry of it . Although I was supposed to be bedding with Jack Millford over the stables , he went to sleep during my pottering about the room . When fifteen minutes before time I stole into the courtyard , it was empty save for ghosts and the ghostly moonlight  | These were somewhat noble ghosts . I had been a member of the company for over two years , and already some of FiddlingFingers ' prophecies had come true . Almost without my knowing it , my mind was beginning to be stocked with the creationsof great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times  --  the Merchant of Venice and As You like It  --  I had heard him quoted by the ream ; also I knew some modern plays almost by heart . Tonight I looked at the moon and thought of luminous Juliet , high-souled Cordelia , noble if incredible Portia , pitiful Desdemona . They were neither original nor brilliant thoughts , but remarkable enough for a former Dick Fingers , even when drunk on mead . The moon too became more wonderful to me than ever . The sun was too high and blinding to belong to men  --  it was God 's business  --  but the moon seemed to take note of us , to care about our little affairs , and shine for us alone . Then my heart gave an exultant bound , because Penny emerged from the scullery door and came walking tall . " Oh , Penny ! " was all I could say . " Where shall we go , Dick ? We ca n't stay here . " " We 'll find a place . " So I led her into the coach shed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriage belonging to some guest of the inn . It was a perfect nest for us , soft cushions and even enough moonlightglimmering through a cobwebbed window that I could see her face . When I curved my arm , she came into it , her head on my shoulder ; and when I bent to kiss her , her lips melted into mine . Although we had often kissed , always before it had had another meaning . This was the kiss of courtship . Yet it was no mere step toward copulation , as kisses so often become in the love affairs of older and greedier wooers , but an experience completeand perfect in itself , a real embrace with physical and emotional satisfactions . Of course it did not mean the same top91both of us . To me it was cloudless heaven ; but it was no meager bliss to Penny , unless all signs failed . We made such love to each other for fully two hours . This too could hardly have happened to our knowing seniors , perhapsfrom sheer lack of endurance . We did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but neither did we fall into the valleys of emotional and physical exhaustion . We were on the high plateau of ingenuous love , the right elevation for us at this stage of our affair , and we would have been cheated had we not crossed it on the way to the Delectable Mountains . It was a well-worn path trod by millions of young people . I do not know whether Nature was our guide , or some wisdom of beauty and restraint which is essentially Art . Perhaps Penny 's sense of not yet loving me enough to yield all to me was partly a highly civilized sensuality , which ' would not forgo the delights of a long wooing . Look thou be true ; do not give dallianceToo much the rein : the strongest oaths are straw To the fire i ' the blood : be more abstemious Or else , good night your vow ! Prospero could have spoken those words to me . Throughout my childhood I had snatched for things , lest they be snatched away . Yet not once in those two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win my utmost goal . I was well enough acquainted with the tricks of seducers from the talk of the taverns , and sadly enough , not wholly unpracticed in them . They would have served me well , perhaps , in honest wooing of my sweetheart . Yet that fire i ' the blood , inevitable and good , and often immersing us both in golden and I think lovely flame , did not cause me to seek more than her soul consented to give me ; and that which she did give me rejoiced my soul . I can not explain this victory , save that loving her had ennobledme beyond anyone 's expectations . In any case , I had come a long way from Cock Street.  | " I love you , Penny , more than anything in the world , " I told her . " I 'm falling in love with you , Dick , my husband , " she answered . Master Purdy began to alter other of our popular plays so that I could appear more often with Penny and in somewhat stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when playing opposite her  --  she was able to draw out of me and illumine what talent I had  --  and quite possibly she was then at her radiant best . Also the audiences enjoyed our playing together . Perhaps they sensed I was in love with her : our intense awareness of each other made any scene between us more intenseand real . Thereby my courtship of her prospered too . We were associatedunder somewhat romantic conditions , in a world of makebelieve ; and at every success or failure we were drawn closer . But when I made the most hay was when we were traveling new roads , and in our leisure hours . Victory seemed very near on the night we played on the lawns of Breetholm , an old manor in Wiltshire , for a sporting squire named Godfrey Blake and his neighbors and friends . The highborn audience was greatly taken with The Beggar 's Opera  --  with the help of some local musicians we did the old stand-by up brown  --  and since the host set the example , the guests mingled with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Purdy remarked it was time for us to seek an inn in the village of Stempot , the bluff squire would not hear of such a thing . " I 'm a widower with two grown sons , both away , " he declared , " and have a hovel here of fourteen bedchambers . If ye 're not gentry , ye 're yet better company than 's swilled my brandy for many a long day , and I 'll put ye up like ye was lords o ' the realm . " " Then we 'll reduce our charge , " Tom Purdy told him ,  |p93flushed  with that same brandy as well as with exaltation at the gentleman 's democratic spirit . He referred to the three guineas we had been promised for our show . " No , yell not , and I 'll not knock a penny off ' t . " " Why , I knew he would n't , " cried Annie Talbot , who had been receiving little attentions from the squire throughout the evening . None of us paid any attention to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's own . Althougha company rule seemed in danger of breach , Master Purdy was all innocence ; and even Herbert and Jack , who had the most right to protest , went cheerfully to bed together without a trace of jealousy . Actually I think they were rather proud of their pretty sweetheart . Her charms had secured us all food and drink and shelter unlike any we had ever known ; and if she cared to be somewhat generous to the great man , they could not bring themselves to be stingy . Certainly she had no sense of disloyalty to them and indeed was pleased that she could serve the troupe so well . It turned out that the room appointed me was just across a dim , deserted hall from Penny 's . Whether the gentleman had observed our ripening love affair and , being romantically inclinedhimself , wished to help it along , there is no telling . A stiff-backed servingman had no more than shown us up  --  evidentlyhe did not approve of strolling players being treated as gentry  --  when I tapped on Penny 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big and shining . But taking my hand , she led me not into her room but down the corridor . " It 's a wonderful moon , " she said . " We 're going out on the lawn . " We stole down the broad stairs and through the big paneled hall to the front door . There a sleepy servitor let us out  --  perhaps he had been put on watch lest one of us were tempted to steal the spoons  --  and we strolled through the flower beds edgedI with box and beside the dark yew trees . On finding a marble bench beside a fishpool , we cared to stroll no more . " I 'm glad it was Annie , instead of you , that the squire favored , " I said . " I am too , " she replied , looking dreamily at the moon . " What would you have done ? " " What I had to do . " I did not understand this , from being begrimed in Poultry . " You would n't have had to do anything you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the walk . " " No , not a thing . " " You could 've kissed him . That would be all right . I would n't have wanted you to do even that  --  the way you kiss me . " " You must think that the kisses I give you are a common sort , that anyone could have them . " " No , " I said , reddening with shame . " Do n't you trust me ? " " It 's so hard to trust anyone , in a place like this  --  all this wealth and power . We have n't got a chance . It shows up how poor and weak we are  --  I am , I mean ! " I stopped , appalled , for the shame was getting into my throat . " Yes , I trust you , Penny  --  always . What I meant was , I do n't trust myself . " " You will  --  someday . " " Maybe I know you belong in a place like this , and I do n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , yes , you do , Penny . Everything you say and feel shows you 're a great lady . In the end you 'll marry someone like the squire  --  younger , and a greater gentleman . " " I 've already married him . Not very much like the squire  --  except in a certain coarseness  --  but younger  --  and a greater gentle-man . " What a wonderful thing for her to say  --  almost too wonderfulfor me to grasp , at first ! No , it was not true . The master of Breetholm was a most impressive gentleman , even if he did appear to like the theater almost as much as he liked fox hunt/ing . Penny had called him coarse  --  I had n't noticed it  --  but so was the age . And there were many nobilities in his life that I could not even appreciate yet , much less possess . For instance , he would cheerfully die for the king . If German George himself was not worth it , he would do it anyway , because of a vague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a faith that where a man took bread , he owed service . To uphold his honor , Squire Godfrey Blake would not dodge a duel with the best swordsman in England ; but I would find an excuse to run . Yet she had spoken what might be true , at last . Surely any plowboy with wide-apart eyes , intimate with the healing sun and the cleansing rain , would have a better chance than I , a gutter-devil ; yet she had seen the vision . She could not have done so , unless she had divined possibilities in me of which I had only a vague inkling . She was never able to make a stage charactercome to life unless she divined in herself the undeveloped elements of that character , whether great lady or lowly slut : she was a thoroughgoing artist . Truly it was an inspired speech  --  and forever inspiring . " I 'll have a manor like this , " I boasted , gutter-devil still . " Yes . " " It will be finer than this . " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe me ? " " Yes , I believe you . " " Is it because you believe I was born to it , as you told me that night ? " " That is n't why I believe it . Maybe you 're the son of a lord , but that wo n't do it . " " I want to tell you something , Penny . I 've sworn I 'd never tell it , until there was more proof , but I 'm going to tell you . This is the right time and place . It 's about how Fiddling Fingers found me . " " It may be the right time and place  --  but do n't tell me  --  for a little while . "  | " All right , Penny . " There was no grievance in my tone , or in my heart . It took the wind out of my sails , considering what store I set on the tale and how long I had bottled it up , but I had learned again tonight never to be provoked with her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was my reward : " I want you to make love to me first , Dick , " she said . We were sitting on a marble bench , beside a mossy fishpool , under tall elms . We both wore the costumes we had worn in the last act of The Beggar 's Opera , I a very picturesque highwayman'srig , with a feather in my cap , Penny the fanciful and somewhat daring dress of the beggar-king 's daughter . It had requiredno great amount of perspicacity to perceive that in these trappings we would be better received by the gentry than in our best off-stage clothes . Also there was a purple-tinted moon , lookingquite as large and unreal as any I had ever painted for a set . These effects no doubt had something to do with the magical stagelike quality of the ensuing scene . Also , when Penny 's imagination was going full blast , she could make any scene seem like one from a wonderful play . Perhaps she dramatized her emotions a little , but mainly she poetized them . They were highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by revealingthem to me by the loveliest words and acts she kindled my own emotions to an unprecedented height , and caused even those sensations that I had considered guilty to seem beautiful as well as blissful . What is beauty , anyhow ? In those days I took it for granted . Now I strongly suspect it is the very real invention of such aristocratic earth-dwellers as Penny , and lent to us lesser lights . They say such-and-such a thing is beautiful because it makes them feel warm and more alive . Perhaps it symbolizes some unrecognized desire . Even if we are too wooden to have the same feelings , we get to believing them . It can be argued that romantic love is more art than nature . Starting with one carnal appetite that caused a fleeting bond between a male and a female , perhaps the highly civilized among us have been inspired to create a song , a ritual , a play that affordsp97a supreme human experience . Like most inventions , it is extremelyuseful  --  in refining sexual passion and inducing young people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does demand idealizations and is helped along by a certain amount of trappings ? Its essential beauty is unsurpassed and entirely real . If this scene with Penny was like part of a wonderful play , it was because , deeply moved , she gave it her highest and loveliest self . Her utter sincerity made it utterly real . She was in love with me . If it were not the same kind of love that I was in with her , I had manhood enough to know how far beyond my best deservingsit remained . Yet in longing to be all that she wanted me to be , I did grow . It seemed that Dick Fingers passed away that night , out of my basic being , and I became Dick Drury . I would be haunted often by his unhappy ghost , but would never quite revive him again . That was because the memories of this intimacy with her would glow in my heart as long as I lived . It was a sensuous intimacy , to be sure . She permitted caresses  --  perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would not have been seemly before , not timely , not pure . The dazzling inkling came to me that soon , perhaps tonight , she would yield all to me that she could ever surrender to any lover . Still it could not occur to me that the same inkling was in her mind . Some of the dirt of Poultry was on me yet , carried over to a better scene , so I thought that such an idea would be unworthy of her . " We 're married , " she told me , bib eyed and a childlike whisper . " Yes . " " Let 's go through with it , Dick . " " All right . " " You remember what you said to me  --  that verse  --  in the beehouse . You shall be my queen indeed . ' I want to be . " " Here on the grass ? " " It would be beautiful , but someone might come . "  | " In my room , then ? " " Yes ... Eat my honey with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's just what a bride wants to tell her lover ! I 've thought over it , and tried to say it better , and I ca n't . " It had not sounded gross to me , or especially voluptuous either , for lacking Penny 's sensuous imagination . Anyway I did not want her diverted from her main bent , always a danger in dealing with such a temperamental person . " Then come with me , Penny , " I said . But when I started to rise , the moon went out of her eyes and they became clear and alert . Slowly they turned to mine . " Wait , Dick . You have n't told me what you started to , a while ago . " " I 'll tell you later . " " No , tell me now . " " Not till afterward , when you 're lying in my arms . Let 's not wait any longer . I ca n't stand it . " " Do you think it 's easy for me ? " Then with the loveliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems to me I will . " " Why is it so important now ? " " How do I know ? It just is . Tell me quickly . " " I do n't see how I can find the words ! " Even these took an aching effort . " Please find them somehow . I 've got a right to know . " " Why did n't you let me tell you before we were so worked up ? " " I did n't know it was going to happen , Dick . Perhaps I did  --  and wanted it to happen  --  but got afraid . " " What are you afraid of ? " " How can I tell you ? Maybe that the curtain would fall . " " I do n't understand . It does n't make any sense to me . " " When things get this way  --  so marvelous it always falls . Listen , Dick . I do n't want to die  --  ever . But when I am so happy , I know I have to  --  soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time seems so short . "  | " Penny ! " " Oh , Dick ! " " Do n't talk that way , if you love me . " " I did n't mean to say it . " " It 's only your imagination . " " I know  --  but even the stars look different . There 's a little wind  --  and the fish keep darting through the water , making little splashes . The moon seems as alive as I am  --  but someday it will be dead  --  as I am . " She was white in the moonlight with the clarity of that vision . If she had lived in Puritan days they would have taken her and burned her . " Let 's go to my room , Penny . That 's something I can un-derstand . " " No , not until you tell me . I 'm sure it wo n't make any differencebetween us  --  tonight . " " It 's only something Fiddling Fingers told me . He swore it was true  --  on his deathbed . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I think you were . " So I told her the tale , the words chosen quite well . It rang true in my ears , and Penny 's vaulting imagination was caught at once . How changeable she was ! She was looking at me with her head cocked , her lips parted with excitement , her color growing , her eyes in the moonlight speaking . " Well ! " she burst out , after drawing an exultant breath . " Then you are highborn . " It did not mean a jot or tittle to me , compared to Penny 's love . I had never known this before  --  never having compared the two things , both so remote and strange . " Do n't think about it now , " I said . " Well , I 'll wait till I 'm alone , then try to round out the story . Maybe I can come pretty close to the truth . " " I believe you can , Penny  --  but not tonight . We 're going to be together , tonight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it does n't make any difference between us  --  does it ? " " Of course not . How could it ? At least for a long time . " " I do n't want it to make any difference ever . Say it wo n't , Penny , no matter what happens , you promise ! " " I promise , cross my heart "  --  and then speaking softly and slowly the rest of the childhood vow  --  " and hope to die . " My Penny loved life with a wonderful love : if she , instead of God , had created it , she would never have let it darken and end , but be shining always . " Shall we go now ? " I asked . She nodded happily , and with our arms about each other 's waists we walked to the manor house . When the sleepy serving man let us in , innocent of what had happened , I gave him a sixpence . At the head of the stairs she disengaged her hand from mine . " I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " I ca n't spare you . " " Do you remember what Marthy told us ? It a' n't fitten for a bride and groom not to be clean , and smell sweet . " Penny imitated the old woman with a startling , almost incredible perfection . " Then will you come to my room , or shall I go to yours ? " I was in such aching haste . " I 'll come to yours  --  and then it will be ours . " Always her fancy could leap into that , while I stood tonguetied . There was a pitcher of water and a washbowl in my closet , that I thought must have cost a guinea . There was a fine linen towel and a cake of French soap . When I had washed in this luxurious fashion , I gazed about me , and thought how fitting a place it was , for Penny 's hymeneal . Few brides had such a luxurious bedchamber , even among the gentry . The room was spacious , the rug richly woven , the chests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bed , of the same rubicund wood , was high and wide , indeed reachedp101with a small stepladder , massively carved and canopied . I put my hand on the velvet spread and leaned heavily . It would be like sleeping on a cloud , I thought . There came a light tap on my door . When I threw it open , Penny entered , warm and breathing . She was a tall , good armful of a girl . Her hair would light an angel 's face , I was sure , and her deep blue eyes were the hue of deep heaven , but her nose was rounded at the end for poking about earth . I closed the door behind her and closed my heart to all further fear . . . But two paces passed my threshold , she halted strangely . " What a magnificent room , " she said , in a low monotone . " Is n't yours as fine ? " Instinct , warned and alert , tried to make me sound casual . " Fine enough , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to have this one , and I t' other , and the lackey mixed ' em up . " " Maybe you looked more like gentry to him than I did . " And she gave me the most loving of smiles . " In any case , it 's our room now . " " No , " she said very slowly , " it can never be . " " What do you mean , Penny ? " " It 's much too fine for players . It 's for a highborn bride , and the squire 's son . " " Oh , Penny ! " " I ca n't do it , Dick . " She turned to me , her eyes darkened as with pain . " Will you ever forgive me ? I know how it hurts  --  but we 'll have to wait . It 's the time  --  but not the place . " " It 's for you to say , " I told her , shivering . " I felt it in there  --  in the room given to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I tried to sing in it , and I could n't . This room is even finer . I ca n't sing to you in it , Dick . " " Do you love me , Penny ? Tell me . " " I love you . That 's what it is . The little beehouse , with the mead on the table , was the right place for us , but this is the wrong place . It 's the right bridal bed for gentry , not for players. pIO2 When we are n't players any longer  --  both of us  --  we wo n't be married any more . " " I ca n't feel that way about it , Penny . " " We do n't belong here , Dick  --  together . It was wonderful by the pool  --  the moon was ours , and the stars  --  but all this is queer and cold . Even there I was frightened . It seemed as though something was hiding in those perfect flower beds  --  to part us forever . " " My little girl ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must forgive me  --  everything . I want you to take my maidenhead  --  only you  --  and you will take it  --  but I ca n't stand for you to do it here  --  not in this mansion , not in this air of wealth , and safety  --  and finished things . You do n't know what my surrender means . I 've been inviolate  --  I 'm a virgin in body and soul  --  I 've never had a lover  --  and I tell you , and plight my troth , that if you pick my flower in this alien place , it will wither soon . " I could not see her plainly any more , and her eyes were like candles seen through rain . She saw my tears , and crept close to me , and put her fragrant arms around me , and she was signally lovely to me , and illustrious . " It will be only a short time , Dick , " she comforted me . " In a few days we 'll find the right place  --  a bower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leather pad in the stable where coachmen sleep  --  almost any place that belongs to us . I 'll know it , when I see it . " " Do you remember , in The Merchant of Venice , how the noble Moor who was courting beautiful Portia chose the wrong casket ? " I asked , my voice low but suddenly easy and clear . " He thought surely he would find her in the casket of pure gold  --  but she was in the leaden one all the time . I 'd have chosen the gold one , too . I did n't know any better . " I suppose I had caught a little beauty from her . " I 'm in the leaden one too , Dick . Open it soon . "  | But it was the door that opened now , and in an instant she had gone . Had I done right in letting her go ? I thought over it for hours , and still believed that no other course had been open . Yet the truth was plain to me now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I exerted a great deal of will power , I might never win her at all . When Shakespeare told of the lunatic , the lover , and the poet being of imagination all compact , he should have included the superior actress . She had been completely sincere in her rebellion against this foreign scene as a place for surrender to me . She truly required , to satisfy her sensibilities , a setting more in keeping with the life she lived and loved . But her retreat had been brought about by something more than that . Perhaps the story I had told her had something to do with it , after all  --  these surroundings reminding her that I was perhaps fated for a life far removed from the stage , and hence our union was doomed to be short-lived . But this I could hardly believe . Instead I leaned to a more reasonable explanation . It might be that such an imaginative girl was secretlyafraid of the initiation . She had almost told me so when she spoke of her inviolacy ; actually she had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her fellow troupers . In spite of the longings of love , quite possibly her instinct to guard this domain made her fear to take the step . But my determination to get her over it was to lead to one of the most bizarre and , in one sense , shocking episodes in our melodramatic history . Even the peculiar world of players did not wholly cover it . It happened that we were not permitted to play at Marl- ' 6 borough , the first market town we struck after leaving Breetholm , and at Devizes , where the king 's court was in session , we feared to give more than a little outdoor show , songs and dances and an " end " or two . Here the best inns had no room for us , so we " No , I 've passed that test , long before now , " I said . " If you do n't know it , you 're willfully blind . " " Oh , Dick ! I do know it ! " I let her alone to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrite and deeply moved , and surely now she would acknowledgemore than that  --  our requited love in the fullest way . She did not . Her body did not yield even a little against mine ; all her barriers stood . " Forgive me , Dick , but do n't do anything more , " she asked . " What do you think I am , a stone image ? " " If you ca n't control it , you 'll have to go . " " I 'm not going to control it , and I 'm not going to go . " She was frightened then . I would have liked to believe that some of the signs of it were affected  --  natural , almost unconsciousdissembling to influence me  --  but I could not ; and in fact perceived that she was a great deal more afraid than she wanted me to know . " Why do n't you yield willingly ? " I asked . " You say you love me , and we 're married . This is the right place for players  --  over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the storm ? What more do you want ? " " I want you to go , " she whispered . " What are you afraid of ? " " I do n't know . Please go . " " Do n't you know that if I go , it means a lifelong defeat for both of us ? This is a crisis in both our lives . Unless we have each other tonight , we 'll lose each other . We 'll never be man and wife , our lives bound together for always . It 's our last chance . " I was fighting for my most inward and dear life , so I fought well . " Please go , Dick , " she answered , trembling in my arms . " It 's only some childish fear that 's making you this way . It has to be conquered . You have to be conquered . " " You would n't  --  "  | " I will ! " She tried to spring up and my arms about . her tightened . I was afraid she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her ; if so , I would have tried to stop her mouth . But she knew she had no right to do so and the conflict was between her and me alone . Outside the thunder blasted ; the wind shook the walls ; the hurled rain rattled on her window . Sometimes the nearer lightning shot blue-white arrows through the cracks of the shutter , so that the cavern darkness of the room was momentarily rent , and I saw Penny 's face white and tear-wet , and she saw mine with I know not what look upon it . But I saw her beauty too , strangely and powerfully accented by the grossness of the scene . All these women 's weapons failed  --  perhaps they turned against her . I had turned against her too  --  any higher motives for taking what I wanted vanished into thin air or , worse , becamespurious . No , I did not love at this moment , because love can not exist without its handmaiden , tenderness . We lie when we say it does ; the deepest love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if it is a mother 's against her child . Children know this ; they are not deceived . It can cause anger , but shrivels in its fire ; it can awaken jealousy and unbridledlust , but it shrinks from their cruelty . I like to think that love is too highly human a thing to stand the sight of our animal natures , but mercifully it sometimes returns with tear-wet eyes , forgiving us our debts that we may forgive our debtors . My darling had nothing left to oppose me but her physical strength . At first she employed it unwillingly and with only enough force to counter my reluctant attack . That truce was short-lived , impossible to this elemental conflict . Presently she was resisting me with all her might . She did not strike me , as she had every right , her nails did not rake my face , and she did not raise one cry  --  she loved me yet for all I know  --  but this inviolate loveliness caused me to have that much more to answerpIo8 for . The hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speared by primordial fire , and the ' roar of the storm without should all have been her advocates ; instead they seemed my abettors . She fought doggedly and long , not letting me off with a limited effort . It was not wakened passion that at last caused her to cease , only exhaustion . So our first union was not at all as I had hoped  --  lovely and sacred . She yielded at last , but did not surrender . She gave not the slightest sign of being reconciled by any involuntary sound or movement . The only mercy was that when her strength was spent , her fears seemed exhausted too , and I could be gentle , with her . I was glad of the dark now , so she could not see my face . " Will you go now ? " she asked in low , sad tones . " Yes . " " I do n't blame you , Dick , but I do n't want to see your face again . " " You want me to leave the Company ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long breath . " I did n't mean what I said , " she told me ; and I think her beautiful eyes filled with tears . " We can still be friends  --  still act together . I wo n't hold this against you , when it was my fault . But it 's spoiled everything as far as our love affair is concerned . There can never be anything more of this kind between us . " " There would n't have been anyway , if I 'd heeded you . " She did not answer , perhaps because she knew this was true . " We were n't made for each other , I 'm afraid , " she told me , bursting out crying . I bent over her and found her wet eyes and kissed them , and somehow took a little hope from their tears . Also she had added , " I 'm afraid , " which I took for a little rift in the cloud . But her next words might close even that narrow door , and I did not wait to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marched highheaded from the room , but my feelings were all too like the Tarquin when he left Lucrece. pI09 If the others of the Company could see no change in Penny when we took the road the next morning , I saw too much . Had she displayed any anger toward me , or even coldness , I could have believed that she loved me still , and hoped for the best . Instead she appeared completely friendly  --  laughing and joking as with Herbert and Jack  --  and completely free . Perhaps I had conquered her only to liberate her from me forever . My laughter that day was sick-sounding , and my jokes were few and sour . In the next few days her attitude toward me seemed the same as before our pagan wedding , save that it held no promise of future riches . She would look for a new lover now , I thought ; and since she was not drawn to either Jack or Herbert , quite possibly that unconscious , nature-guided search might cause her to leave the Company . This last had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the valleys between the hills of his little grandeurs  --  where he often had to go when the footlights died  --  he knew only too well that Penny was too good an actress for his troupe . When our liquor died on us , we others knew it to . Penny herself must know it best of all , I thought  --  by the confiding of her genius . We were always praising one another  --  when we were well-fed and warmed with wine and in funds all of us became Colley Cibbers , Peg Woffingtons or Barrys  --  but when we spoke thus of Penny , we meant it . Lack of opportunity elsewhere , lack of aggressiveness , and loyalty to the Company had caused her to stay with us until now . Now it seemed to me all too likely that she would quit our poor shows and humble audiences and seek fortuneand happiness in London . Her playing at Westbury struck me as disspirited . I took it that she was pining for greener pastures . At Trowbridge we were all in the dumps , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were rained out ; and at Chippenham  --  we happened to be touring Wiltshire , while awaiting an engagementp110at a real theater in Bath  --  we had the bad luck to compete with a badgering . During these performances Penny played to me only too well  --  with a compassionate bounty , I thought . BecauseI did relatively well  --  forced to it by a frayed heart  --  she kissed me at supper before all the Company . That kiss was remarkable for its warm friendship and approbation . Prospects brightened at Malmesbury  --  as far as the troupe was concerned . A great wool barn would provide our theater , a clerk 's platform doing for the stage ; the squire and the bailiffwere both agreeable to the performance ; and the countryside wasfull of money and good nature because of a recent boom in the cloth trade . The weather was spring 's finest , to make you thinkof love and lamb chops . Save for my breach with Penny , I would have had private hopes of another sort . The town had a pleasant seat  --  it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high ground overlooking a reach of the blue Avon . It had many romantic ruins , dreaming of Aethelstan and his savage court . The inn , called St. John 's Hostel , was cozy and smelling pleasantly ofbacon and stored wool , and it had been the rest of Thesbians since Burbage trod the boards . It seemed just the scene that Penny had pictured that night at Breetholm  --  perfect for the purpose . Indeed I saw her looking at it with what seemed a mocking smile . Since it was Mayday , with many yokels in town and no one working , we prepared to give our play in the late afternoon. u But a little trouble started as Penny was eating dinner in an inglenook of the taproom . It had happened that she was alone , since she was to open the show with some songs and must be dressed early ; the rest of us were at the theater , setting the stage . A young sailor , who gave his name as Tar Rayder , and on a visit here from Bristol , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was not surprised , after one look at him . He was not a man ' fore-the-mast , who God knew could be ruffian enough . If so , he would have most likely beenp111set back on his heels by Penny 's rebuff ; and the tapster would have finished the job by throwing him out . Instead , Tar Rayder wore the cap and coat of a ship 's officer . No doubt he had newly risen to that estate by the untrammeled use of a heavy boot , a maul of a fist , and a beast 's heart . In truth , few ship 's officers of the times had reached the quarter-deck by gentleness . There was only one thing worse than going to jail , Jerry 's Jollies used to tell one another , and that was to be pressed . This fellow was a year or two older than I , about my height although with a far heavier frame , and rather handsome in a coarse way . He took the grossest liberties with Penny , kissing her lewdly , thrusting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had to leave her meal half eaten to escape him , but before she did so , she made it plain enough that she would have nothing whatever to do with him . In revenge , he came to our show , proposing to ruin it . He very nearly succeeded . After throwing all the rotten eggs and cabbages he had brought  --  luckily he was too drunk to hit the mark  --  he booed and catcalled every time Penny appeared on the stage . The other spectators liked us well enough , and why they did not suppress him themselves is hard to understand . On the whole , they were humble folk and a ship 's officer suggested authority to their mace-ridden minds ; even this far inland the men had lived in terror of the press gangs . I would not like to think they took a bestial pleasure in our persecution , although I have known it to happen with seeming-civilized audiences . Certainly unless he were checked soon , we would have to close the show  --  a most hated and humiliating defeat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were emulatinghim . The second act closed with a particularly tender and gracefulscene between Penny and me . This appeared to drive the dog into foaming at the mouth  --  vile foam that blew up to us and sullied my sweet girl . No , no one living could sully her truly ,  | but he tried hard enough , the final vileness hurled at her at the close of the scene . " Get off the stage , ye dirty ' ore , " he bawled . Both of us did get off , Penny unable to hold back her tears , and I so shaken with rage and hate that at first I could hardly speak . " I 'm going to fix that fellow , " I told Master Purdy . He looked at me , his face brick-red , and his eyes very small and bright . " It 's my place to do it , Dick , " he answered quietly . " No , sir , for a certain reason , it 's mine . " " That might well be . " " Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to do it anyway , but I dearly need your blessing . " " It 's bad show business , Dick  --  and it 's dangerous no end  --  but there comes a time we can stand no more  --  and I gi ' ye my heart 's blessing . " So I walked out on the stage . Herbert and Annie were singinga lively song , unmolested save by a few triumphant snorts and catcalls by the wretch ; I stopped them in the middle of a bar . The theater grew silent . " There is a man here who has insulted one of our players , and insulted all of you by doing so in your presence , " I told the audience , the words coming swift and certain on my tongue , and my voice clear . " His name is Tar Rayder . " " That 's me , " the fellow yelled . " What ye going to do about it , ye pretty bastard ? " " I 'm going to call him out , " I told the throng . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as a dirty dog . I 'll fight him with any weapons he pleases , or with fists . And I 'll ask all of you who love fair play  --  you Englishmen who are famous for fair play  --  to see that no one interferes with my giving him the thrashing of his life . " " Good for ' ee , laddie , " a deep voice called . " We 'll see ' t is a fair fight , " said a man of substance on the front row. pI13 " Why , I 'll break your back with one hand , " Tar Rayder boasted . So the audience formed a ring in the market square , close by the cross , generally more pleased with this prospect than if it were a play at Drury Lane . Largely they were with me , too , I think , although this could change in an instant . " ' Twill be fists , " Rayder told me , " and they 'll do for ye brown . " No doubt he made this choice from trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any nicer weapon . Actually no other was practicalexcept quarterstaffs , for only the Quality could fight duels with swords or pistols without danger of the gallows . Knives would have suited me well , if the law had permitted  --  I did not think I had lost my dexterity with a narrow blade since I had last slit a purse  --  but was even better satisfied with the present program . This may seem strange , since he was heavier than I , undoubtedly stronger , and used to bashing poor sailormen at sea and on shore . The truth was , I might have a surprise for him . AlthoughI had never liked fighting  --  better say , because I had never likedfighting  --  I was no ninny at it . When yet an urchin , the facthad become plain that the only way I could stay out of fightswas to be good in them . While worsted oftener than winning , eyes blacked and nose bloodied so frequently that it seemed astate of nature , I had come to be reckoned at least a dangerousantagonist , inflicting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bully . I was light on my feet and could hithard . Also I had learned something of guard and parry . PatentlyI could not have been Jerry of Jerry 's Jollies were I an easy mark . Some of the spectators shook their heads when my enemyand I peeled off our shirts , and a cold cramp came in my heart . He was a magnificent creature . I had expected him to resemblea baboon : instead he seemed a passable Hercules . His massivechest bulged with muscle ; his corded neck squatted powerfullybetween oxlike shoulders and long , punishing arms . Although narrow-waisted and sheep-legged , he must have weighed thirteenstone . I , barely eleven , and looking more like a fencer than a fisticuffer , appeared to be in for it . " Why , the big ' n ' 11 kill ' en , " a woman cried , with some pity but more pleasurable excitement in her tone . Truly he might cripple me for weeks , or even for life . If he got me down the crowd would be more likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad and bloody time in England . But I had already faced one lion , when I had determined to call the man out . It might have caused a breach with Purdy , whom I loved  --  never before had he permitted any reprisal against a persecutor  --  and it could have easily started a ruinous brawl to land us all in jail . If this other king of beasts was more directly fearsome , we had met on the desert from whence I could not flee . Calmed by this , and strengthened too , I think  --  remembering my bright Penny and the shining brightness of my cause  --  I made ready for him . He came in slugging , purposing to smash me by sheer power . He would have succeeded , too , if he were able to get at me : I could not hope to stand up to him hand-to-hand . Instead I kept out of his reach , hardly dusted by his knuckles until he overstretched himself , then dealt him a clean smack on the side of the jaw . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it did sting him , and the outcry of the crowd stung him worse . Naturally they did not want to see me downed in the first onset . Partly it was sportsmanship  --  I seemed too patentlythe underdog  --  but mostly it was their concern for a long , free , good show . I did not care about that . What I took note of was his lashingout blindly , almost giving me an opening for another , harder blow . He was one of those fighters who can not keep their heads . Unless I missed my guess , his native ferocity  --  a great asset to any battler  --  could be goaded into reckless fury . This must be my strategy . So my best tactics were to stay out of range , which alonep115was likely to infuriate him , and whenever I could get past his swinging fists , to deal him a biting blow . I was not a good enough boxer to land very many , and out of practice besides ; yet oddly enough my two years as a strolling player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This enabled me to avoid his sledge-hammer blows and indeed had quickened my eye and hand as well as lightened my feet . Too , I had thus developedwind and strength for long-sustained exertion , for there are few toils more grueling than dancing on the stage . The schooling of the boards , combed with Penny 's tutoring , stood me in good stead in another way . I was not afraid of the crowd . When it booed me , for not coming to grips with my enemy , I did not mind : the play was the thing . Rayder , however , could not stand their laughter , when occasionally I caught him with his guard down and whistled home a blow . On the whole , it was a good show for the constantly growingcrowd . We appeared so mismatched , yet I was still on my feet , still unbloodied . Indeed , it was my antagonist who showed the marks of battle , one of my blows having caught him on the nose and caused a fine flow . The spectators would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them perceived a certaindrama in this lion-and-unicorn fray . Rayder 's massive form impressed them , and his bearlike rushes excited them , yet it had begun to dawn on them that I was something more than his prey , and they had better keep a sharp eye on me too . " Kill him , big ' n , " someone shouted . " He 's naught but a dancing master ! " " But he 's mastering yon bully , just the same , " a woman shrieked . There were many women in the crowd , nearly all of whom appeared to take my side . Truly , if it were not for women , Evil would have triumphed over Good on earth and probably in heaven long ago . It was Eve , not Evil , who caused Adam to eat the holy Apple of Life . She had known intuitively that the Serpentwas their true friend ; save for her , Adam would have tamely submitted to the Tyrant 's chains of impotence and death . The great majority of the men were with me too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in Tar Rayder the release of their own curbed and aching brutality , while they saw in me tonight the champion of Woman , whom in their hearts they most darkly hated . Anyway you could tell the bad from the good , the damned from the blessed , by their partisanshipin this clean-cut test . It had come to me now that I was going to win . My opponent'sstupid rage was blinding him , helped out by a streaming cut or two I had given him over the eyes . I was able to smack him once and sometimes twice in every lumbering charge he made . Moreover , the victory might come sooner than I had first hoped , not because I had hurt him much as yet , rather because one whom he thought his friend had turned on him . The brandy he had drunk had at first warmed and emboldened him ; now it was poisoning him . Indeed , my later and sober opinion was that it had hit him harder than I throughout the fight , stunning and unnerving him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His rushes became ever easier to avoid ; and there was a longer breathing spell between them . And it was he , not I , who needed the respite ; my second wind was smooth and strong within me , while he stood snorting and panting through gaping , bloodied lips . Before long I became the attacker , sidling about him , jabbing him around and through his tardy , ponderous guard . It must have been a strange sight , in the sweet late sunlightbeside the market cross , perhaps something like a bear brought to bay by a terrier , or a tired hawk assailed by a kingbird . His breast and mine were streaked with his blood . I would have liked to watch our gigantic shadows . But surely more speed and skill dwelt in his big arms than he had shown in this fight ; and I had best not meet him cold sober . The proof of it came when I , made too bold by his seeming helplessness , had worked in close to try for a knockout . HispII7bowed right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fist taking me under the eye . If it had caught me on the jaw instead , the fight would have ended then and there , and the mayhem begun . Anyway I was knocked down ; and the crowd roared as he lumbered forward to finish me off . He was not much too late , in fact only a little . The punishmenthe had taken from his bottle and me slowed his charge ; meanwhile pure fright touched off the reserve strength in my still nimble muscles to fling me into a somersault and onto my feet before he could hit me again . Although badly shaken and seeing stars , I was able to dodge him as he chased me about the ring , slugging the air . The crowd bellowed . My opponent 's party howled with savage exultation . " Kill him , big ' n , " the shouts came . " Hit ' en again , and ' ee 've whopped ' en . " Then a shrill woman 's voice : " Why do n't ye stand and fight , ye pretty coward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somebody trip him up behind ! " Suddenly it seemed that the whole throng was thirsting for my blood . This was not so . The crowd craved gore , and would take mine if none more welcome were offered , but it preferred my enemy 's , so they could watch it gush with a good conscience . These people knew that right was on my side , and wanted it to prevail if at not too great a sacrifice of excitement . Their clamor turned to cheers when , my head cleared and vision restored , I ducked under Rayder 's swinging fist , and coming up inside it , popped him a good one . It knocked out of him the last of his bellicoseness and he stood like an ox . Those who had sided with him were in haste to turn their coats . Beasts to start with  --  to have favored brutality instead of chivalry  --  they were naturally treacherous in the way of beasts . " The young'n gi ' a clean fight , " Purdy heard one of them pronounce . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actors , and ' t was why I feared he 'd gouge or knee the sailor , for I 'm always for fair play in any bout , but now he 's showed hisself a man , why , my hat 's of to him . " With what brilliance even the stupidest of men put themselves in the right ! " Get your hands up , " I told my foe . They were still closed , and swinging slowly like dying pendulums , but were low at his sides . He tried to lift them and could not . Measuring the distance , I put my shoulder and back into a powerful punch to his jaw . The hurt to my hand was the most serious I had obtained in the fray , likely more than that taken by his jaw , since it is doubtful if he knew what hit him . But of course he toppled , hit the ground hard , and lay like a log . " Now 's your chance , younker , " a savage voice cut through the roar of the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When instead I turned away  --  even in Poultry it had not been quite the thing to pummel a knocked-out man  --  the throng fell silent . For those few seconds every person in it was alone , no longer a bee in a hot , angry swarm , and was a little frightened , a little cold . I had seen the same thing happen many times in the theater , as every spectator suddenly remembers his forlorn identity , the solitary path that his soul must take when the mob breaks up . So had Master Purdy seen it , ten times to my one ; and he knew what to do . Briskly he stepped out of the crowd , flushed by his feelings and the ruddy glow of the low sun . " Ladies and gentlemen , " he began in a clear , strong voice . " You 've just seen a ruffian knave get his just deserts , at the hands of our brilliant young actor , Dick Drury . Now he 'll resume his part in the great play we 're giving  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old trouper he was . " Mr. Drury , you 'll be able to continue with the show , will you not , in spite of this interruption ? " " I 'll do my best to please the audience , " I blathered . " And you will please them , every last one of us knows . My friends , our show is less than half over . What has already occurredwill be narrated briefly for the benefit of you newcomers ,  |p119so  you can follow the story without the least difficulty . The best and most exciting scenes are yet to come . Even so , those who 've already paid will be admitted free . The rest of you will pay only threepence , half the usual charge . Everyone follow me ! " Not more than fifty people , I should judge , bethought themselvesof their burning bean pots and other affairs and hurried away . Another score of men , no-nonsense fellows and devotees of manly sports , gathered around the fallen gladiator and solemnly discussed the best means of bringing him to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our theater , where Master Purdy was hard put to it to pass those who had already paid and yet collect from the newcomers . Actually an astonishing few got in scot-free . Like so many old ticket takers , Purdy had a trained memory for faces  --  necessarily short but uncannily comprehensive  --  and was an expert at spotting deadheads . Mrs. Reynoldssprang to help him , while Herbert and Annie encouraged the laggards with a lively song and the clang of tambourines . Penny and I were busied within . She had not yet said a word about the fight : she needed all her breath to coach me in some hasty improvisations for the last two acts of the play . Good trouper that she was , she wanted to give the spectators what they wanted  --  provided it did not hurt the show  --  and obviously their immediate desire was to see the hero of fisticuff in another heroic role . The play 's story and structure did not permit any great strengthening of my part , but I strutted what strength it had , the others fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared well-satisfied . When by a last-minute arrangement with Jack I did not merely accuse him of villainous crimes , but seemingly knocked him headlong with a pulled punch to the chin , the roof almost rose . After the play , the Company supped together at the St. John Hostel . More , we had a private supper parlor , Master Purdy being so exultant over our narrow escape and heavy gate that for once he waved away the publicity of our eating in public . It was a considerable sacrifice at this time  --  the inn was full of gapers  --  but he made it manfully , and I think was wellrewardedby joy-loving Bacchus himself , the god of players . Truly that freckled little man could have known but few such happy events in all his eager life . No king in his court could have been prouder , because he ruled us through our love and confidence in him , and not one of his subjects coveted his crown , and his kingdom was Elysium , where only heroes dwelt , and no rain fell . When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an agony of gratitude , then none of us could withhold tears . We men clasped hands , and Mrs. Reynolds and the girls kissed all of us and one another  --  an orgy of emotion , perhaps , but when I would grow old and mean and hard of heart I would trade my hopes of heaven to know the like again . My peculiar bliss was that Penny 's kiss for me seemed a little different from the last . I could not tell why , or be certain : I knew only that it caused exquisite tinglings along my spine , which surely she could have prevented if she had tried . Also she was sitting beside me , Master Purdy himself placing her there . Although she had given me no little signs as of yore  --  our hands or knees touching or a sly toe of her shoe prodding me in the shin  --  she turned to me quickly every time I spoke , her eyes inscrutable but certainly not dull . The climax was ushered in when Master Purdy had toasted me , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope . Then he rose again , very red of face , and something in his look arrested everyone . " Dick , you told me something this afternoon , when I said it was my place to handle the riffraff , " he began . " Two or three of our Company heard you , so it can be kept no longer a secret . " " I reckon that 's right , sir , " I said . " You told me it was your place  --  and I believed you . Some of us have suspected such a situation for a good while . If you and Penny had any reason to conceal it until now , surely the time has come for us to rejoice with you . " And that phrase did not sound stilted from that great little man.  | " I 'll answer that , " Penny said clearly , while my heart stood truly and painfully still . Queenly she got on her feet . " You see , " she went on , in that wonderful lilting voice of hers , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Bright star ! As an actress she had chosen this time and place to heal our breach , but it was as a beautiful young woman in the pride and exultation of her first love that she stood there , acknowledging the surrender of her all . She was my lucky penny , I thought , my eyelids burning at the clear , deep discovery . I did not know by what golden chain of circumstance , mysteriously welded , I had found it , but I knew at last that na greater fortune could ever come to me . I knew too  --  a sudden prophetic glimpse , such as appears not often even to the old and wise  --  that the great good fortunes that come to mortals are always gifts , bounty heaped upon them without rhyme or reason which to call deserved must make the high gods hold their sides . To have made her declaration before all the Company was perfect theater , but true to life of Penny , and a fitting recognition of their close and happy bond with us as fellow players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an intense emotion . No one cheered ; the moment was too solemn for that . Every face around the table lighted up . " But we have n't been living together behind your backs , " Penny went on , when all had recovered . " We want to  --  and intend to  --  but we 've been waiting the right occasion to start . " " Why not tonight ? " Mrs. Reynolds asked . It was the inevitableresponse of any player . " Why not indeed ! " cried Purdy . " Why , if you 've decided you want each other , what could be a more fitting time ? " Annie broke in , almost weeping . " Darling ! It 's absolutely right . " She meant , of course , it was like the end of a good play  --  at least a popular play  --  and I was painfully afraid such obvious footlights would put Penny off . I should have known better . Life itself was a play to her.  | " I think so too , " she said quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Millford broke in , " but I 'd better point out one thing . I 've been through it , and I know that how you start out counts a mighty lot . Dick 's been in a fight . Maybe he 's too tired . " " He ought to be at his best , that 's certain , " said forthright Annie earnestly . " I 'm not a bit tired . " I said . This was largely true : my body had great resiliency and the bout had been neither very long or more strenuous than a gymnastic dance I had trained myself to give . " If Penny can stand to look at this black eye  --  " " I think she 'd regard that as an honorable scar of battle , " Herbert remarked . " Then it 's agreed ? " Purdy asked eagerly . I was watching Penny , and saw her nod . " Dick , do you take this girl for your true love , as long as you both desire ? " " Forever , " I answered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they , Mrs. Reynolds ? " Never in our hearing did Master Purdy address the lady in any other way . " It has a pretty view  --  overlooking the river . " " I do n't think they 'll look at scenery tonight , " Jack remarked . " We 'll take it thankfully , Master Purdy , if you and Mrs. Reynolds can spare it , " Penny said with wonderful dignity . " Then we 'll drink to you both  --  and your happiness together  --  and Penny shall reply to the toast . " Penny 's reply was singularly beautiful . She rose , opened her mouth and heart and out came the most perfect of all love songs , sung by another player long ago : " Drink to me only with thine eyes And I will pledge with mine . Or leave a kiss within the cup , And I 'll not ask for wine . "  |p123At  the second verse , the more beautiful of those two incomparablejewels of song , she turned her eyes full on mine . Then with that sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poesy that sea-changed all who came close to her  --  she sang softly and sensuously for the others but to me alone : " I sent thee late a rosy wreath , Not so much hon'ring thee , As giving it a hope that thereIt could not withered be . But thou thereon didst only breathe , And send'st it back to me , Since when it grows and smells , I swear , Not of itself , but thee . "  |p124I  CAN NOT SING TO PENNY , with my crow 's tongue , but if I recall clearly our honeymoon , perhaps she will sing to me again . I would recall it too for my faith 's sake  --  a faith in man and the stage he has so strangely erected here below , to console him for his disinheritance of heaven . I would recall it for the joy and faith of other brides and bridegrooms ; and for old men to putter over , with such lukewarm or lewd imaginings as they can muster ; and for old women that they may perhaps remember their own loveliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient lover 's brain . I would like to describe its scenes in frank and intimate detail , since they were so important in both our lives , so illustrative of scenes of equal importance in other lives . Save for such unions , the stars might burn and God sit in heaven , but no one would be here to see them or to wonder about Him . But I can not give that description . It is as though the heavy dust our frantic journeys have caused to lay on the roads of life shuffles up and blinds me . I remember such little things as carrying her headfirst across the threshold of our bridal chamber . The meaning of the old custom was that she could never leave my nest by her own will , only if carried out feet first . I recall the shyness that overcame us both , and how we blathered at each other , until Penny saw the pity of it , and stopped my lips with a kiss . Neither of us mentioned the night at Devizes , and by tacit agreement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patience , we stood at the window gazing at the moon . It had been nearly full on our night in Breetholm and now was gray and old , but we did not take it as an ill omen , such brightness was in the room.  |p125Of  her strange , deep-buried fears that had balked us before only vestiges remained . When we embraced , her hands thrust upward against my chest at first , then they crept around my waist and pressed gently down . Her eyes were at first round and overbright , but the pointed light in them soon became diffused and brimming . I think the candles we had left burning helped a good deal in assuaging her fears ; for by nature she was afraid of the dark and a creature of day . By those candles , I perceived her whole and indivisible beauty . Of course to me personally she was the most beautiful of all created things . To all men she would have been a good example of what we divine is the source and temple of beauty from which we spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If I had sat beside sleeping Adam while Eve was being shaped , I could not have suggested one change . How smoothly that Artificer had joined her limbs on her trunk , and fitted her throat into the little arch in her collarbones ; how ingenuously had color been employed in skin , hair , lips , eyes , finger- and toenails , and breast ; and perfect to the eye was the symmetry of every curve and contour of her body ! What a surprise for Adam , when he wakened ! We , his sons , have been flabbergasted ever since . I did not believe the myth , but could scarcely believe in Jehovah either , that a God so stern could fashion so lovely a thing . It seems that only an artist-god , caring naught for piety , content with the joy of creation and the appreciation of connoisseurs , and a good , lusty fellow too , would have given her naked flesh that gloss and glow . We spent our honeymoon on the road , making love to each other , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept together in holes and corners of taverns , each a new bridal bed , it seemed , for the flower she had given me was only now coming to full bloom . Often we so yearned for each other before the footlights that the audience became subtly impassioned , doubtless resulting in an upturn in the birth rate in those towns ; then we would steal off before the house was half-emptied , sometimes to the ribald mirth of our companions . No doubt we were good butts of ribaldry . Young married pairs have been so time out of mind , and Penny had ceased to be a maiden with a vengeance . We were not above roaming off when we stopped by the road for lunch , a haycock doing for us as well as for a country swain and his lass , or a leafy bower in the woods , or a grassy hedge corner . But if this were unseemly in Propriety 's eyes , in Penny 's eyes it was idyllic , and they were my true criterion . She had a pagan heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Edmund 's words , as long as her love lived . Stodgy connubial duties , coquettish or prudish and half-ashamed , might be to some women a desirable compromise with rude nature , but if this were her only other choice , proud Penny would rather be lewd . It was no wonder that one who so loved life would love the dynamics of its creation . We scarcely cared to glance ahead , or to look back . The immediatemoment was so rich and satisfying . But one night in a clean bed in a fine , new tavern , when I had asked what she was thinking to cause her to lie so silently , she sat up , pillowed my head in her lap , and said she would tell me a story . " One that you made up ? " I asked . She liked to make up stories , some of them very strange , and many sad . " No . This story is about you . " " Is it true ? " " I do n't know . It could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain your being at Fiddling Fingers ' door . " It caused my heart to beat a little faster , I did not know why . Anyway she had not mentioned the matter since the night at Breetholm , and I thought it had passed clean out of her head during the excitement and joy of our honeymoon . On my part , I had hardly given it a thought . Even in the presence of gentry  --  when no one in low station can hardly keep his eyes off them , let alone his mind  --  it had hardly flicked across my soul , and then not like a tongue of flame . Either it did not matter to me in this period of my life , or for some reason I had wanted to forget it . P127The first story she told me was of a highborn maiden with a lover below her station . He had been disposed of by her haughty kinsmen , but before her love-child was thrown into a poor London street she had hidden under his swaddling the crest of her house , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was a far more reasonable explanation , Penny said , than that I was the son of an upper-crust lover and a humble girl . If he had cared enough to buy me silken swaddling and hang a family ring around my neck , he would not have permitted my abandonment . It was unthinkable that I was the son of a scoundrel , or that my parents had not loved each other and me ! My character and appearance , she believed , were the result not only of good blood , but a favorable prenatal influence . It was a wonderful story , and how beautiful was her warm mouth as she told it ! Even so , she was more inclined to believe that both my parents were highborn ! Perhaps one or both had been married before they had met , perhaps they belonged to enemy houses , like Romeo and Juliet . If my beautiful mother had died at my birth , an old nurse had put the tokens on me , in fealty to a great house . If either of my parents were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere . " Well , I wo n't search for them , " I said . " You should , Dick . You owe it to them and yourself . " " Not as long as I can have you . " " You 'll be happy , being just a player  --  with me ? " " I 'm not much of a player , but I 'll stick to it . You made it plain that when we 're no longer players  --  both of us  --  we 're no longer married . " " Maybe you were stolen by gypsies , " she told me , flushing a little over that reminder of our conditional marriage . " They must have stolen ' a good many babies , to get such a bad name for it . Then some gypsy mother began to love you and did what she could to restore you . "   This had long been my favorite solution of the mystery , whereby I was not a bastard , not a castaway . So when hardly a month later we passed a camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not turn away a tall , lean crone in a flowing , gay-colored dress who accosted us , only made sure that our thin purses were not in reach of her quick and skinny fingers . In truth we would have stopped anyway . Penny could never resist fortunetellers , and after putting in their mouths what she wanted them to say , almost beggared herself to reward them for their good auguries . Besides it would have been most unneighborlyof us to rebuff these fellow travelers . They did not know where they were going any more than we , but they knew a like compulsion to be gone . " Cross my palm with red , and I 'll tell you something of profit to you , " the beldame told me , when she had got all she could out of Penny . " No , but I 'll cross it with silver , if you answer one question in full truth . " " Is it if this lass will be true ? " " No . " " Is it a letter you 're expecting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It 's a lost heirloom , in a way of speaking . " " Put silver in my hand , tell me where you saw it last , and I 'll answer . " " No , because I do n't remember when I saw it last , and I 'll not pay you till you answer me fair . Was there a highborn baby stolen by the gypsies about twenty years ago ? " The woman 's lips opened narrowly and I feared she would spit at me . But as she started to turn away , Penny touched her brown hand . " He has the right to ask , grandmother , " she said . " He lost his people and is looking for them . He means no harm . " Of course the old Romany woman was unable to resist my darling 's warm voice and shining eyes ; her gaunt face softenedp129and her twisted mouth again looked human . " It 's a sad thing to lose one 's people , " she murmured . " Will you tell him , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , when bands of your people meet . " " No , lady . I 've never heard a whisper of such a thing , by any fire , in any tent , on any road . " " Then will you look into his palm , and tell him what you see ? He 'll pay you well . " So the old woman took my hand , hers as dry as an old chip , and seemingly with no more blood in it . " You 're going on a long journey , " she intoned . " So are we all , " Penny broke in . " Tell him what he does n't know . " " You 'll love this pretty one , as long as you live . " " Tell me what I do n't know , mother , " I said , " for the sake of when you were a juvel " ( young woman ) . It was the only gypsy word I knew , a souvenir of a disgraceful incident of my boyhood at a gypsy camp near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she told me sullenly , her face like the bark of a tree . " Not even for sixpence ? " I asked wonderingly . " No more , " she repeated , looking away with sunken , glazed eyes . " Will I find my father and mother ? " " I tell you , rom , I ca n't see any more . " With that , she dropped my hand , indeed appeared to throw it down as though in sudden petulance . Perhaps I had angered her again by my one gypsy word  --  it might have had implications I did not understand  --  and the word she had used to me could be some sort of Romany insult . Master Purdy told me later that " rom " meant merely gypsy man , but perhaps it too had implicationsbeyond my understanding . She was standing with her body twisted a little at the hips , as though in a muscular cramp . Her green dress fluttered in the wind and some bright copper coins around her neck gleamed in the sunlight . Behind her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave trees fluttered too , and for no apparent reason the picture was etched in my memory forever . " Will you tell him , grandmother , if he 's going to be a great actor ? " Penny asked gently , giving her a penny . Very slowly the woman 's small , black eyes wheeled to mine . " Yes , " she replied in a low , harsh monotone , " he 'll be a great actor soon . " Penny believed every word of it and was tireless in schooling me for my coming career . Ridiculous as a villain , wooden and hopeless in tragic parts , I learned to take any romantic part to Purdy 's satisfaction , and could acquit myself creditably in all comic and character roles . I was no longer the mere handy man , stand-in , and super of the Company . Our regular cast became seven experienced and capable players . Thus our shows were better , we had to do less cutting and revising of plays , and could attempt a few for which until now we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , I developed into a better performer than Herbert Rutland or Annie , and about as good as Master Purdy save in his best roles , although I would never have the versatility of that red-faced little man , or the superb stage trickery . The audience gave me this rating , night after night . But the gypsy 's prophecy of my becoming a great actor was still far from fulfilled . When two years and a half had passed since the memorable night at Devizes  --  five years since I had first walked the road from London to Uxbridge  --  I began to face the stunning fact that it never would be fulfilled . The audience told me this too . So did my common sense , although sometimes in Penny 's arms , bathed in that warm glimmer she gave forth  --  or even in the glow of shandygaff , the poor man 's flatterer  --  I could believe my heart instead . I was not so good an actor as either Jack Millford or Mrs. Reynolds  --  both palpably second-rate . At my very best , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her part , a satelliterather than a conjunctive star . Even so , I was wonderfully happy in this period . Perhaps no actor in England could have given her better support , mainly because it was my whole heart 's desire . I had developed a peculiarskill in feeding her part . I understood her as well as any man ever could and fully perceived her genius . In turn she trusted me implicitly and turned to me like a child for everything . There was something more too that I did not yet grasp  --  resulting in a kind of radiance upon her , an instantaneous and powerful bond between her and the audience , whenever I was with her on the stage or even watching her from the wings . If ever a wrong can make a right , my act at Devizes had done so . Otherwise I could never have won her , and been in a position to help her . Child at heart , old as Eve but young as spring , and temperamental in the extreme , she constantly required a steadying hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright that I believed it would burn out in a few years save for my care . I made her rest , eat abundant nourishing food ; at night in my arms she was no longer afraid of the dark , sleeping deeply and peacefully and in beauty . I was behind her , and she knew it , in every trial . I supported her when she had to face a hostile or apathetic audience , and calmed and quieted her when she was too excited to do her best work . Of course this profited the entire Company . We were coming to be known as the best provincial players in England . The master of the king 's revels , whom we met at Bath , gave us a written blessing which worked wonders with the mayors and dignitaries of the provincial cities , so we passed by all but the most populous and likely market towns . True , our purses stayed thin as ever  --  although our gates were larger , so were our expenses  --  butwe put up at better inns , and gave better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's excited talk of our having our own theater in London was no longer pot-valor . A small house in Southwark or Spring Garden was an entirely likely prospect , if Penny stuck to us for a year or two more . She was our starlight , my " bright , particular star "  --  but my lucky penny too ! I thought over that a good deal , to find an extraordinary fitness in the pun . She was not an Alladin 's lamp , to make my every wish come true . She was no " Open Sesame " to heaped-up treasures ; she had not bathed me in the Styx . She did not bring me fortune but she did give me luck . I had to work hard and long for everything I won , but somehow she put it within my reach . She was the blessing on all my endeavors . How far I had come from Cock Street at age twenty-three might be judged from events taking place in Boston , in Lincolnshire . A chance conversation with the town beadle set them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play here , why , ye can , " the official told me . " He owns the warehouse ye want , and he 's cousin to ' is worship , the mayor . But he 's dreadful down on gypsies . " " Why , blast you , we 're not gypsies , or anything like ' em . " " I can see ye ai n't . Some o ' ye  --  the young lady and yourself particular  --  look more like gentry . But anybody who lives on the road smells like gypsies to the baronet , he hates ' em so cruel . " A tingling sensation began at the bottom of my spine and moved slowly upward . " Did they steal something from him ? " I asked . " That they did , " he answered belligerently . " Was it a baby  --  a boy baby ? " " That it was ! How did ye know ! " " Was it in the sumer of 1736 ? " Fiddling Fingers had told of finding me in September of that year . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause the French frigate was wrecked off Washmouth ! But I ca n't swear ' t were summer or early spring . " The man was gaping at me now . But before I approached the baronet , I must tell Penny of these staggering prospects . They were more than that , to her . She was immediately convinced that my long-lost highborn fatherP133and his long-lost son would be united tonight . Her color heightenedand her eyes dazzled me . " Why , it 's the most wonderful thing  --  " she burst out . " Do n't tell the others . And if it should be true , I 'll stay with the Company . " She stood a little taller , I thought . " All right , Dick . " " Will you come with me to talk to him ? " " No , that would spoil it . He wants his son to be a gentleman , not a player . " " I intend to be a player with you always . " " My own love , " she told me fondly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your best . I 'm going to borrow some of Herbert and Jack 's things for you to wear . " Our fellows did not appear astonished that I was going to make a call on gentry , or resentful of my not telling them the business . I think that , although never mentioned in my presence , very rarely hinted at , a belief had grown up in the Company that there was some mystery about my birth . My silence about family and kinfolk had been enough to start the story among these romantic-minded players , and even at first my accents had smacked of gentility . Now they scurried around to provide my costume for the call . Jack lent me his best coat  --  a fine garment bought cheap from a tosspot baron because it had been spotted with spilled brandy  --  Herbert the cocked hat that was his pride  --  Annie provided a fine kerchief that I guessed was a present from Squire Blake  --  Mrs. Reynolds let me carry the walking stick that Barton Booth had given her . And when I was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red and crooked face and supplied me with what I needed most  --  good heart for the enterprise . " Dick ! " he broke out . " Tell me , Dick ? You would n't be planning to leave us , would you now ? " " Such a thing is furthest from my mind , " I answered . " He 'll do only what he has to do , " Penny said . " ' T would be a bad , sad day for the English stage , and that's no gibble-gabble ! " that extravagantly generous little man told me . Penny walked with me halfway to the South Gate , near which Sir John Sendall dwelt . When I left her , she was beside me still , and my affairs would prosper . Although it was a large and handsome pile , I gazed at the house calmly . It was only brick and stone and polished wood , put together with gold  --  not a miracle of flesh , mind and spirit , not a play by Master Shakespearethat I could have for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flunky at the door stood correctly and deferentially asked my name . " ' T is Richard Drury , of London , " I told him , " and my business is with your master . " Sir John Sendall received me courteously in his best parlor . Acting the gentleman  --  it seemed living the part  --  I did not stareat him , but my gutter-devil stuck by me almost as close as mylucky penny : so after one seeming polite glance I could almostcount the hairs of his bold eyebrows . He looked very little , if at all , like me . Fair-skinned and blue-eyed also , his hair was sandycoloredand his build much heavier , and his round chin had no small cleft . Could this man be my father ? I reached inward for a feeling of warmth , of natural attraction to him , and it seemed there was a trace of it . Certainly I liked him at sight , but that would follow his being a likable man . Actually he was the topsortof English gentry . Power without responsibility had not coarsened him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . " My business deals with an event greatly painful to you , " I told him , after the amenities had been exchanged . An expression I could not read flashed across his face  --  grimness or cynicism perhaps . " If you mean the loss of my infant son " " You might like to know that in September , 1736 , an infant was found in London who appeared about three months old . He was raised by an old fiddler . "   " You heard that I lost a boy about then ? " he asked , coldly . " Yes , sir , I happened to , talking to the beadle , but  --  " " He 'd be a young man now , and I think you 're about to tellme that you are he . " " Yes , sir , I was . " " Is there any proof that he was gentle born ? " I detected a faint tone of sarcasm in the question . " No proof , sir , only some evidence , not as good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes a little . " Good swaddling , I suppose , ' . " he remarked . " Yes , sir , and a gold ring bearing a crest on a string around his neck . Both were stolen . " " Is n't that rather rash ? " " I beg your pardon . " " No one told you my baby had a ring around his neck ? " " No one . " " A good deal of hair for so young a babe ? " " My foster father never enlightened me on that point . " " My baby fell from his trundle bed and cut himself underthe right eye , causing a scar . Will you move into better lightand let me see if you have such a scar ? " " I have such a scar , sir , but got it when I was about twelve years old in a street fight . Plainly I 'm not your son , and I 'll take my leave . " " I beg your pardon , young man . " He spoke again in warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like some others who 've tried to foist themselves on me . I noticed the little scar when you first entered , and tried to trick you . " " Then are there any more questions you 'd like to ask ? " " No , save to inquire whether you asked the beadle leadingquestions , or whether he volunteered the information ? " " I asked leading questions , I 'm afraid . " " I thought so  --  and he 's a very agreeable and romantic informant . My loss occurred not in 1736 , but in 1740 . Since you do appear a gentleman , I 'll tell you that little Tommy was notP136taken by gypsies . That 's a favorite tale on the countryside . Actuallyhe was drowned by a demented relative of my wife , in an attempt to baptize him in some fancied religion . Although the unfortunate woman is now dead , we still choose to keep the matter quiet . " " I 'll respect the confidence , and bid you good day . " " No , have a brandy with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled two small glasses with the drink , and handed me one of them . " I 'm always delighted when one whom I took for a knave turns out an honest man . " " Thank you kindly . " " You gave your name as Richard Drury  --  " " That 's my stage name . I 'm an actor in the company at present in Boston . Obviously I do n't know my real name . " " Your story interests me . Many people have told me about highborn foundlings  --  I had to listen to ' em willy-nilly  --  but must say I did n't take much stock in ' em . Yet yours seems wellsupported , not only by the tokens found on you , but your appearance and manner . " I gave him my best bow . " Blood tells , you know , " he went on . " And would n't it be an odd thing if you , an actor , were really a cadet  --  perhaps the heir  --  of a great house ! " " I 've always felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your accents are good  --  with a flavor of the West Country , I think . " " Fiddling Fingers , who raised me , was probably from Bristol , and spoke very well . Also I 've tried to educate myself . That might account for it . " " No , self-education is likewise a sign of good blood . " When he had talked of this awhile  --  like most real gentry , Sir John had a lively imagination  --  he still did not want me to go , and insisted on pouring me another glass of his fine , French brandy . When this round had warmed the cockles of his heart , my visit began to bear fruit of an astonishing sort .   " If my boy had really been stolen , and returned to me a man grown , I 'd be pleased to have him turn out so well . I 'd like to see more of you . " " I regret , sir , I 'm leaving Boston so soon . " " Maybe you wo n't . I own a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young fellows  --  ambitious and clever  --  are hard to find . I want gentlemen of mark , but too many are idle and vain . You 're no doubt good at figures  --  what if I offered you a position there ? " " I could n't take it at present , Sir John , because it would mean parting with my wife . " " Is she Quality ? " " She 's the daughter of a schoolmaster , and highly talented and beautiful . If I may say so , she surpasses any lady I 've ever seen . " " I like that spirit , hang me if I do n't . I 'll hazard she 's wellpicked . Then why ca n't she come with you , and live in Boston ? I 'll provide a pretty cottage , and if you 're the buck I think you are , you 'd be sure of a good post all your days . " " I thank your honor , but she 'd not leave the stage . I think someday she 'll be as famous as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prize compared to being recognizedLincolnshire gentry  --  one well within the grasp of both of ye . " So it would seem , by the reckonings of the times , still Pennywould not consider it . I considered it , though , in the light of myboyhood dreams and my six years on the boards . My future underSir John Sendall 's patronage would be more secure than anyother I could see : it would also be more brilliant , although tosave me , when I thought of Penny , I could not say bright . Hewould present me as a gentleman . His friends might lookaskance at first , but if I continued to live the role , in time theywould concede me the position . I might marry a gentleman'sdaughter who would bring me a dower ; my children wouldreceive a coat of arms . In truth it was a better opportunity than I had ever expected or hardly hoped ; better than any Fiddling Fingers had conjectured . But since Penny would not leave the stage , I could not either on any account whatever . The wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she were willing , and not solely for the sake of her art and happiness . I would like to think so , to be a little grand , but knew too well where my treasure was . Instead , I was like a gypsy offered a good place as a tenant farmer , or a young bawd who has a chance to reform and become an honest housemaid . Respectable folk are ever provoked and puzzled by their squirmings and vapid excuses ; but I kenned them well . " Sir , it 's hard for great folk to understand how players regard their art , " I told the baronet . " We could n't forsake it at this time . " " I 'm sorry to hear it , and if you change your mind , let me know . " " Thank you , and I 'll take my leave , to dress for the show . If you and your family and friends would attend as my guests , we 'd be greatly honored . " " Why , my son Henry and I accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I see you 're a gentleman , Richard , come what may . " Moreover , he would call for his coach , and drive me there , and ask me to present him to my wife ! As we were waiting , a servant served us supper , and I had never felt so grand since I was born . When we arrived at the theater , our splendor more than repaid my friends for the loan of their finery . Master Purdy bowed us in in sight of the crowd , and Sir John shook hands with me as I was leaving to dress . During the performance , Penny added a verse to one of her songs to honor our highborn guests . The play took amazingly well with the packed house , all of us being so warmed and excited . After the show , Sir John came backstage to compliment Penny , handsomely and with patent sincerity . He could not help but see that in beauty and intelligence and grace she outshonep139most of the highest ladies in Boston . The proof of it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mind about that offer I made you , let me know . " " I will indeed , Sir John ! " " If you do , I hope your lovely wife will accompany you . We 'd like to have both of you in Boston . " Penny could rarely bear the sight of me in bed , without making haste to join me . She was at once such a child , such a woman . Tonight she dallied about our pleasant room in the inn long after I was tucked away . When I asked her to hurry  --  I wanted her in my arms when hearing about Sir John Sendallshedawdled the more . " Your father struck me as a very wonderful person , " she said in a warm , easy voice as she took down her hair before a mirror . " He 's not my father . It was a false alarm . " Her hands stood still only a second or two . " But he wanted to adopt you , did n't he ? " she went on . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That would amount to adoption . You 'd become a gentleman . You 'd marry a gentleman 's daughter and receive a dower . " It was as though she had read my mind . " It 's your great chance , Dick , " she went on , turning to look at me . " Tomorrow morning you must accept his offer . " " I 've already refused it . " " He left it open . I heard him . Listen , Dick . " She came and sat down on the edge of the bed . " Opportunity 's knocking at your door . Do n't you dare let it pass by . " " It 's a kind of life I once wanted . I do n't want it now . " " Oh , Dick ! From the very first this is where you were going  --  what you 're born and fit for . We 'll sleep together tonight , and make love , and in the morning we 'll say good-bye . " " Penny , I would n't leave you for anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you know why I wanted the kind of marriage we had , instead of in church ? It was so that , when the time came , we could part . " Her beautiful eyes had filled with tears . " I 'd like to see you get shed of me ! " " Do n't make it any harder for me . You know what you 're always saying  --  you 'll never be a great actor . If it 's true , it 's because you know your fate lies elsewhere . " " I know I 'll never be a great actor , but you 're a great actress . " " A real man ca n't give his life to his wife 's career . " " I never felt so real a man , as when I 've helped you a little . I 'm going to keep on trying . " For a moment she was still . She sat with her hands , so expressiveand lovely , dropped in her lap ; her magic mouth was a little drawn ; her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole light of my life . " You 've always insisted I must play in London , " she told me slowly . " Suppose I get a chance to  --  and you do n't . " " You 'd go to London , and I 'd tag along . If I could n't play with you , I 'd still be behind you . I would n't be a burden to you , I promise you that . " Then she began to weep , and I gathered her into my arms . I had hoped she would go to sleep there , in her shift , but afterwhileshe stirred and began to woo me with a kind of headlong passion . In our breathless embrace she seemed to give herself to me in a fuller measure than ever before , or else she received me in a fuller measure . Thereafter she went almost instantly to sleep , moaning a little from time to time , and once laughing brokenly , a strange sound in the darkness and silence . In the morning we journeyed with the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the weeks and monthsP141that followed we rarely mentioned Sir John Sendall , and then in a casual way . I wrote to him from time to time , careful of wording and spelling . Penny urged me to do so  --  saying it was my duty  --  yet I was always a little ashamed , for wanting to anyway . I suppose I wished to keep another string for my bow . Nor were our relations quite the same thereafter . I did not know where the difference lay , unless it was a kind of urgency upon us , to make the most of every day together , as though these were numbered . We disliked to part even for short periods . When we united our bodies in love , it was as if to seize our last chance ; but we did so less frequently than before , probably because of how much we gave and received , and how intense was each experience . Rarely now did she speak of my becoming a great actor , and then with an air of strain . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew . The Company knew it too . More , they made open acknowledgmentof it , without any self-flattering reservations . The rest of us still hoped for a chance there  --  a fair hope , considering that new theaters were starting up in the city 's outskirts  --  but she could not wait for us much longer . Indeed , it had become so patent that she belonged on the London stage , so manifest at her every entrance on our poor platforms , that Master Purdy had begun to feel guilty over her continued allegiance to him . It came to be September , 176o . Both Penny and I were twenty-four ; I had been seven years with the Company , and she about eight . The coming winter threatened us with the usual hard time  --  meager audiences stamping their feet in cold theaters if we traveled , the spending of our lean savings and likely our properties put in pawn if we holed up . But in the ensuing spring , Penny would try her fortunes in the capital . I was resolved on it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ca n't let you stay any longer than that , baby , " he told her as we sat at supper at Canterbury , and his face was brick-red and puckered . " I 've no right to keep you any longer from your chance . I owe it not only to you , but to the whole English stage . "  | " That 's true , Penny , " said Jack Millford . " We 're stage people , " Purdy went on , cueing himself for a rattling good speech , of which he meant every word . " Its glory anywhere is our glory . It 's our profession , its fame counting more to each of us than his own private fortune and success . If you can help us get a good theater there , well and good . If not , we 'll go on the best we can without you . " " Dick 'll go too , " said Annie , big-eyed . " We would n't have him do anything else . But that 'll leave just five . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , " I said . " Never , " Purdy cried , above the chorus of protests . " If I could have my pick from any company in London , I 'd still want you . But we 'll look for some young talent . If we do n't find it , we 'll go back to doing turns and ends in tavern courtyards . " This last brought us all close to tears . Herbert and Jack , who loved each other more than any brothers I had ever known , touched glasses , their faces flushed and their eyes bright ; then Annie , their faithful sweetheart , kissed both of them . Mrs. Reynolds , sitting by Purdy , squeezed his hand and bit her lips ; Penny sat enflamed . It could not strike me as sentimentality , because it was so utterly real . The trouble with outsiders was , most of them were only half-alive . We players lived to the very marrow of our bones . But only a week later , at Brighton , a new hope shone for us all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most distinguished figures ever present at our shows . Indeed , I was rather pleased with myself for recognizing his distinction , considering that he was a small , spare man , richly , but not gaudily , dressed . From the stage I could see his countenance as though by some inward light , and could not help but play to him . He clapped only once and lightly  --  when Penny sang a love song  --  yet I counted it a higher tribute than the roar of the whole house . It turned out that my companions had noticed him too , and were all in a fine flutter when after the show he sent word thatP143he would like to come backstage to pay his compliments to Miss Penny Price . " ' T is Sir Anthony Beach , " the boy gasped . " En owns half Bristol , and breaks bottles with dukes . ' Ee better look sharp . " Purdy rushed to escort him up , while most of us tried to tidy up the place , stuffing and sticking our litter out of sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as she sat beautiful and calm at the folding dressing table I had made for her . Annie curtsied as the dignitary approached : my girl did not . And it seemed to me that he was pleased by this noble pride , for he smiled winningly . He was an even more winning man than I had at first perceived . He walked with a singular natural grace , and even though small , he suggested to me a good and perhaps deadly swordsman . His age was probably forty-five , perhaps close to fifty , but I would have never guessed it save for his hair , so white on the sides that it had a bluish tinge in the candlelight , and iron-gray on the crown ; his supple body and unlined face were those of thirty-five . His countenance was one of the most handsome I had ever seen , with girlish dimples in his cheeks and a small one in his chin , his brow wide and high , his gray eyes large and far apart , his nose a little arched like a Norman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little feminine in its perfection . He gave Penny a grave little bow , which she returned , and did not touch her hand . " I 'm Sir Anthony Beach , " he said , in an oddly unaffected and modest way . " I wanted to tell you that I enjoyed your performancevery much . " " Thank you , Sir Anthony , " Penny replied . " Now I should like to ask a favor . If you do n't care to grant it now , I 'll understand you 're tired , and will opportune you later . " " I hope I can oblige you now . " " Well , then , it 's to sing for me one or two verses of the love song you sang between acts , Dream of Me Tonight . ' I do n't quite trust my judgment of it , for fear I was influenced by the cordial audience . " " I 'll gladly sing it , " Penny said . And without any preliminariesor flirtations , she opened her round , white throat  --  she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried by a sweet refrain , came forth alive : " Dream of me tonight , adored one . Let my dreamed arms enfold you , Deny not my dreamed lips the bliss of your kiss , As in my poor dream I hold you . Will you forget the moon shining bright , When tomorrow there would rise no sun ? Dream of me , Cynthia , my lost delight ! Dream of me tonight ! " Sir Anthony Beach listened with deep and empty eyes , his child 's lips a little pursed . When Penny finished , he nodded slightly . " Yes , it was just the same  --  perhaps even a little better , " he said . " Thank you , Miss Price . " Sir Anthony turned to Master Purdy , standing there clasping and unclasping his freckled hands . " Sir , will you and your whole troupe oblige me by having breakfast with me in the inn tomorrow morning ? Any time after eight would do . I confess I 'm a rather late riser . " " Why , we 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Perhaps it will be only a social occasion . On the other hand  --  but I 'll let you know tomorrow , when I 've thought it over . " The great gentleman bowed and departed , leaving the Companyagog . Only Penny appeared calm , and I thought that was because she was a little frightened of some great turn of fortune that this visit augured . But we were all in it , Purdy insisted . She was our star , of course , but all of us had been invited to the breakfast ! Although no one said precisely as much , we couldP145almost hear the plaudits of our opening night in our own theater in London . Jack Millford , ever practical , made some quiet investigations of our tomorrow 's host . From the innkeeper he learned that , while Sir Anthony Beach by no means owned half Bristol , he was the founder and main proprietor of the West Africa and Indies Company , great shipowners and sugar merchants . He was richer than most barons . His knighthood had been awarded him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the scion of an impoverished Pembrokeshire family of noble lineage . While hard to guess in such a cultured man , he himself had captained a trading schooner in his younger days . He was an indefatigable patron of the arts . " I knew he was n't a skipjack when I first looked at him , " Purdy declared . " Note his quiet manner and way of talking  --  did n't make one promise , let alone do any bragging . He did n't even tell Penny why he wanted her to sing ! By St. Christopher , a word from a gentleman like that means more than a bushel of bottle-twattle from fly-by-nights ! " But Penny went to sleep in my arms without a mention of Sir Anthony Beach . She believed that some crisis in our lives was very near . At breakfast with our distinguished host , her premonition was well borne out , but in no way that she feared . Indeed , the proposalthat he made to us , although somewhat different than any of our number had foreseen , made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you spare Miss Price for two weeks , to the whole Company 's profit ? " Sir Anthony began , after he had proved himself the most affable of hosts , and we were full to the gorge on bacon , curried eggs , and kidney pudding . " Why , I reckon we can , " Purdy replied . " No , that 's too strong a statement , " the knight went on , with a fine respect for his own word . " I hope and believe ' twill be for the Company 's profit , but I ca n't guarantee it . I can guarantee that if my plan fails , you still wo n't be losers . "   " That 's fair enough . " " I 'll put it to you straight . As you know , there 's a theater in Bristol  --  the building and equipment equal to many in London . The new license-holder , Mr. Joseph Chichester , is a warm friend , of mine ; and knowing my interest in the stage , he asked me to help him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel he can afford one of the more famous London companies , and when I went to your play last night , it was in the hope of discovering some likely talent . " Penny leaned back , a little pale , but the rest of us could not forbear leaning forward . " I did indeed , " Sir Anthony told us , after sipping coffee . " I do n't refer merely to Miss Price , who obviously is fitted for any stage in Europe . The rest of you did well , and I felt you would do better in your own theater . Perhaps I 'm mistaken in that , but it seemed to stand to reason . " " I can assure you , we would , " Purdy said , his voice trembling . " We would n't have to spend so much of our time and energies traveling , and any actor does better in a regular theater . " " My thought precisely . Well , if my friend should engage you , you 'd have headquarters in Bristol , but would also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would appear there at the height of the season , but there 's a fashionable crowd there most of the year , as discerning and as liberal as any in London . Now I do not know that Mr. Chichester could pay what you ask , but I feel that he will . I would even suggest a figure half again as much as your present total salaries and shares . He would add other players , and whether you could keep your company name I have grave doubts . Frankly , I 'm not even sure he will want , you , but the way I have planned your introductions , the danger of that seems remote . " " We 'll take your advice in every way , Sir Anthony , " Jack broke in . " Thank you . Living in Bristol  --  loving the stage  --  I 'm very anxious for good plays to be given there . My plan is simply thatP147Miss Price arrive in Bristol on Friday next , and put up at the Cabot Arms . I will be at leisure then to present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her on the spot  --  I 'd wager a good deal on that  --  and after she sings at the opening of the Merchant Venturers ' Festival on Monday , I 'll propose a performanceof The Merchant of Venice  --  a fitting choice , I fancy  --  for the festival 's close on Saturday . " He paused , his singularly handsome countenance troubled : we thought he was embarrassed . " It just occurred to me  --  perhaps that play is not in your repertoire . That would be most unfortunate . " " Why , we gave it in this very city , only a year ago ! " Purdy cried . " Good ! Excellent ! Well , then , Chichester will protest he ca n't find the players in time . Miss Price will suggest she can find some . You 'll arrange to be at Salisbury on Wednesday night , say at the Poultry Cross Inn . A letter from her will be waiting for you there , saying whether to come on to Bristol by coach  --  you need bring none of your scenery  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some local performers for the minor roles . " " We could go to Bristol the same time she does , if you think best  --  or just happen to be there when you propose the play . " Sir Anthony considered this . " No , I do n't feel it would be wise , " he told us . " Mr. Chichester would guess it was by prearrangement  --  aplan to work in her friends . Knowing the man , I 'm afraid it would spoil everything . Truly I 'd advise against your coming even to Bath ; but at Salisbury it will seem as though you 're merely on tour , with no thought of Bristol . It 's only a short journey . " " Then we 'll be at Salisbury , at the Poultry Cross Inn . " " If the play is a success  --  and I 'm quite confident of that  --  I doubt if Mr. Chichester will look further for his company . Miss Price  --  this is for your travel and tavern expenses . " He held out two gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she cried , almost her first words since the talk began . " I could n't pay you back if  --  " " I 'll get it out of Chichester , never fear , " the great man told her with a faint and most winning smile . " And even if he balks , the money 'll be well spent in trying to get good players for my native city . " Although there had been a theater on the outskirts of Bristol for nearly ten years , our company had never played there . There had been some kind of trouble between the manager , a former London comedian , and the municipal authorities , and strolling troupes had not been welcome there . Thus Fiddling Fingers ' injunction that I " walk wide of Bristol " had not yet been broken , a fact that had seemed a little queer and amusing to me , since I would not mind the stink of slavers in Avonmouth , and was free of any superstitious notion that I would catch any of the bad luck he had had there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least as far as my purse was concerned  --  I might have seven or more fat years on that very forbidden ground . It was as though a wheel of fortune or fate had taken a full turn . At once Sir Anthony rose , waving aside our chorus of thanks . He must ask us to excuse him , as he must take coach for Bristol . Would we sit as long as we liked over our coffee ? Giving us a slight bow , he turned away , and it seemed to me that his mind turned to other matters before he had gained the door . " That 's a man indeed , " said Mrs. Reynolds . We played Portsmouth as we had planned . The show was an outstanding success , for actors are none the worse for being agog ; the plaudits of all Bristol rang as sweetly in our minds ' ears as had London 's heretofore . Penny 's performance had an intensity we were unable to recall . Were it not natural  --  the expression of her present emotional state through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When at the last moment sheP149switched " Dream of Me Tonight " to a sad old folk song called " The Sailor 's Bride , " her listeners living by the sea were almost all in tears . This was Southampton now , and tomorrow morning Penny would leave for Bristol . If her journey prospered , this might be our last stand together as strolling players ; we would unite with her there but it would not be the same . We chose The Merchant of Venice . We needed to practice it , even if the dejected and declining port was famed for its hostile audiences , and we would have played safer with a rowdy farce . Anyway we wanted to give the best and noblest play we knew , and the greatest of Shakespeare 's comedies . Penny would be Portia , of course , Annie a mischievous Jessica ; we had changed Nerissa 's part to fit Mrs. Reynolds 's mature beauty . Jack Millford would double as Antonioand Tubal , I as Bassanio and black Morocco , and Herbert Rutland would be kept busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimately the Duke of Venice . Master Purdy would play Shylock . Although a comedian and character actor , he had always been magnificent in this great role . Tonight he surpassed himself . Barton Booth could not have done it better ; if divine Richard Burbage could have risen from his forgotten grave , he would have come behind the scenes to thank him . Rapacious and hateful , he was yet darkly tragic : both the wild heights of exultation and the profundity of sorrow of a shepherd nation driven from their pasturages  --  scattered , some dwelling as aliens in haughty Venice , yet never forgetting , never doubting high God 's eternal Choice  --  shone forth from the transcendedsoul of that little red-faced actor . It seemed to me he blazed . It was often the practice of the stage to burlesque Shylock , exaggerating his Jewish mannerisms for the galleries ' harsh laughter . Purdy gave to that perverse , passionate character all the dignity it deserved . Yet the audience was instantly arrested . Clever , able Jack Millford in the part of the Merchant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them forgive his spit on the JewishP150gabardine and side with him . Truly the curtain had not been up ten minutes before all of us realized that we were giving the best show in the history of the troupe . We were all intensely wrought-up and could hardly remember we were actors , with such strange verisimilitude had we entered into our parts . In the casket scene I rose to wholely unexpected heights . The long speech beginning " The world is still deceived with ornament " became at once Bassanio 's and my own : Long ago I had looked for my lucky penny in a golden room and had not found it there . It was at this point that she , as Portia , first overwhelmedthe audience and forced them to frantic applause : " 0 love , be moderate ; allay thy ecstasy ; In measure rain thy joy ; scant this excess ! I feel too much thy blessing : make it less For fear I surfeit ! " The part of Portia is extremely difficult to put over to modern audiences , unless they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The notion of a young girl masquerading as a learned judge before a high court insults the intelligence . Tonight we had what amounted to an Elizabethan audience . We had turned these dull Southampton burghers into that , by the fervor of our performance . They were as gusty and emotional and unrestrained as the crowd in the Rose Theatre , when England was glory-swept by the late tide of the Renaissance , and hard , cruel Gilbert , great Drake , and tortured Raleigh kissed Eliza 's jeweled hands . Penny became Shakespeare 's own Portia , radiant , wise as Eve , beautiful as Helen , compassionate , highborn . Purdy gave her cue for her greatest speech . Advancing into the center of the stage , she delivered it slowly , the first part to the audience  --  now a projection of the Duke 's court . In spite of their music , the lines did not seem some that she had learned , but rather came to her , when a lighthearted Venetian maid in love found herself the central power of a tragic drama . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theP151world to hear and know , she turned to Shylock , and with growingeloquence and in the humility of great inspiration made her supreme plea : " Therefore , Jew , Though justice be thy plea , consider this , That , in the course of justice , none of us Should see salvation : we do pray for mercy ; And that same prayer doth teach us all to render The deeds of mercy . " The rest of the scene flamed . Even dull Herbert became an illustrious Doge , bending from his high seat to plead for Antonio'slife . The people in the audience hardly breathed , and we felt their massed emotion chimed with ours . The curtain was halfway down before they could recover themselves to peel forth applause . Of course we players were all in tears . The play ended , but we were too exalted to hold any kind of organized celebration . Only Penny remained sober , from sadness mainly , since some old days were dead , and some new about to begin . Also she was still wrought-up , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I would have to look after her soon , I thought . " If we do as well in Bristol , we 'll be famous overnight all over England , " Purdy was proclaiming , while he poured brandy into a bucket to make a punch , gesticulating with such vigor that we all feared he would spill it . No matter if he did ! There were casks of brandy , barrels of fine French wines , hogsheads of golden mead ! But Penny came and plucked me very lightly by the sleeve , and when I followed her out of the others ' hearing , she was trembling . " Let 's go home , Dick , " she cried . " Home  --  " I echoed stupidly . " The only home we 'll ever have . A room in a tavern . " " No , in Bristol we 'll  --  " " Do n't talk . just come . "   " Do n't you want to stay for a bumper ? " " I want another kind . " It was very rare for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like all wedded lovers , we had secret words and tokens , but ours were mainly from Shakespeare and mythology . But it was not at all rare for Penny to have such passion immediately after an exalted performance on the stage , although usually in a less puissant degree . That might appear strange and perhaps ' depraved to more prosaic people , although I have known instancesof intense religious feeling having the same effect . To me , it was simply one of the lights in Penny 's rainbow . It amused me a little , at times , and delighted me naturally enough ; and truly her need of me was as vital as for food and sleep , after such giving as she had just given the audience . Perhaps most artists have such earthy needs : They feel everything stronger than we run-of-the-mill , so that they may illumine our lives . " I should n't have said that , " she told me , whispering like a child , " but I like to be vulgar and coarse . " " It gets lonely where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For my eyes were open tonight . " Not when you 're with me . It used to be so lonely , but not now . I felt it again a moment ago , when they were all so enrapturedabout my going to Bristol . But let 's not talk . Let 's run . " " All right . " Her face and body changed a little , I know not how , and she was Portia again , giving her curtain speech , although now her sweet , wistful little smile put another meaning into the lines : " It is almost morning , And yet I am sure you are not satisfied ! " It was so like Penny . I loved the ground she walked on . Then it was no wonder that one touch of her lovely flame should enkindle me . We said hardly a word , as we slipped out of the emptied theater and through the balmy darkness to the inn . The stars looked down as strangely as on our night at Breetholm , asP153though privy to our secret ; perhaps their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked swiftly , yet the distance seemed far . Actually it was short , or we might have gone searchingfor a dark doorway or a forsaken courtyard , like a fourpenny street girl and her drunken catch . I would not have put it past Penny , if the notion had struck her . In our cozy room with half the night before us , haste and hunger cheated us after all . What we thought would be our farewell love-making was too gross to be remembered when we were old . But Beauty , rebuffed , had not forsaken us : I knew the goddess well when Penny went to sleep in my arms . She lay there almost without stirring until just before dawn . Neither did I stir much , for I loved holding her there , so sweetly breathing and childlike and relaxed , and any strain on my muscles did not prevent me from sleeping more than I desired , since I wanted to keep vigil over her before she left me tomorrow for the first time in our wedded life , foreboding some great change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep , black tide of night that had thought to drown the world forever finds out it is not omnipotent and must ebb again , and even little birds in trees are sure they will pipe again , my love wakened . I was instantly awake , instantly knew that we still had each other and that unhappy dreams of walls and yawning gulfs and searchingsand lonesome callings were still only dreams . She kissed me sleepily , and after nestling awhile against my side , she asked me to light a candle . " Wo n't you go to sleep again , Penny ? " " No . I dreamed I was afraid of the dark . " So I got up , and with flint and tinder lighted a small blueyellowflame . It showed me her eyes deep and wide , and her hair a nimbus , and little glimmerings precious to me came and went on her arms and shoulders as she breathed . " I 've something to tell you , Dick , " she said . " All right . " " It is  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! Are n't you surprised ! " " No , I 've known it a long time . But I have n't known so very long how I love you . " " You said you did at Malmesbury . " " It was true , but not as I love you now . " " I 'm glad it 's grown . " " It did n't grow . It just spread out and deepened . I think I began to love you mainly because you loved me . But now I 'd love you even if you stopped . But do n't ever stop . " " Darling ! " " I could n't bear for you to stop , even if I died . " " Do n't talk that way , Penny . " " I want to live in your heart always . " " You always will . " " I do n't care about anything more , any more . I used to play for the people out in front , but now I play for you . " " You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply I do mean it . Yes , I want to make them happy , when I 'm so happy , and cry when I want to cry , and always to tell them how we love each other  --  I want to bring them in  --  but it 's all for you . It 's not just to make you proud of me . It 's to give you more , and more . It 's my offering to you . I lay it at your feet . " " I ca n't bear for you to say that , Penny . " " Why not , when you made it possible ? I 'm only returning , in another form , something you gave me . You never stinted me . Without you I would have starved . And I take back what I told you at Breetholm . " " You told me many things , that night . " " I said that when we 're no longer players , we 're no longer married . Let me take it back ! I want our good angels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are bad ones , Dick ; there always are . They hate love , they hate beauty , they hate people . Listen : I swear to you by my soul I 'll go wherever you want to go . If you leaveP155the stage , I 'll leave it too . If you do n't want me to go to Bristol tomorrow , I wo n't go . " " Sweetheart ! I would n't have you miss the chance for anything . What could I do in the world , that 's half so important as upholding your genius ? " " I do n't know about that . You 've grown so much  --  " " Because of you . And I deny your right to leave the stage for my sake . " " I do n't want to , but I will , sooner than lose you . " " You 'll never lose me , while we both live . " " I wish you were going with me to Bristol . " " It will be only a few days . If I went with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They ca n't be doing burlesque and ends in this critical time . " " I 'll be so lonely . " " You 'll be pretty busy . And you 'll be staying at the Cabot Arms . " She lay quiet awhile , then rose on her elbow and gazed into my eyes . " Will you always love me , Dick ? " she entreated me . " Penny ! You know I will . " " Do you swear it , cross your heart and hope to die ? " " I swear it . " " We 've only a little time . It 's getting gray already . Play Adonis with me , Dick . " That was our name for a certain caress that she loved to have me give her . After that we wooed each other , confiding in hushed whispers our dearest hearts ' desires ; until one desire became paramount to us both . And this union in the slowly clearing light was different , more deep and meaningful , than any we had had before . Truly Penny 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whether it was the cause or the effect of the full wakening of womanly love I do not know . She endowed me with it , as this light grew . There was no longer a trace of a great actress needing an adorer : we were a young man and woman who had become one flesh . Darling , will you always remember that dawn ? The sad stars failing , the candle paling and forgotten ? I could see you now . The cold glimmer through the glass loved your warm , glass-smooth flesh and played over it . Each of us was not passiondrivenfor the other , as we had often been before : we shared one indissoluble need and together satisfied it . We expressed in earthwaysthe mystic linking of our souls . I do not know what love is . It confounds my philosophy . I do know that within that gleaming jewel of time , while we performed an act that men most mock  --  even though or because it gave them life  --  we touched the zenith of earth-bound happinessand heard Apollo sing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A cock crowed stridently , for he was lord of many wives , sire to countless chicks . Blue-eyed Aurora could tarry no longer on Tithonus ' gray couch ; she rose in radiant robes that set the whole earth glowing . A drunken roisterer , his money gone , slammed the door of the taproom and went shouting and cursing down the road . Your lips moved over my face , giving me countless eager kisses , but not one unprized . You whispered secrets that at the time I understood ; now my soul closets them from me , lest my blunt thoughts maim them . I loved your every look , sound , touch , and fragrance , and I tasted you like wine , but above all I loved your loving me , because it made my title valid to all the rest . I remember how you tried to consume me , to make me part and parcel with your own felt beauty , and the pride it waked would be my highest pride as long as I lived . I could never part from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we traveled . After the darkest night , you would recur like the dawn . You would be my lucky penny always . P157THE COACH FOR BRISTOL was to leave at seven . Since our companionshad roistered long after midnight , I scarcely thought they would rise to see Penny off , but every one appeared , heavyeyedand not too steady of foot . Annie and Mrs. Reynolds were both concerned over my sweet 's slim satchel . She was not taking enough clothes , they said , to make a sustained stylish appearance at the Cabot Arms . The truth was , she had no others , partly from constant neglect of her wardrobe  --  never taking a stitch in time , and leaving her things about  --  and partly because of her prodigality with money . Nor would Annie or Mrs. Reynold 's garments fit her tall , deep-bosomed form . Then and there I drew on Purdy for some back pay  --  painingthe little man  --  and furnished her with a guinea . With the two that Sir Anthony Beach had furnished her , she could live and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissed us all , and the two women cried , and dry-eyed she took her seat . The driver cracked his whip . The coach lumberedout of the courtyard . I would have run beside it like an urchin , to where the fields began , save for the Company 's dignity ; so it happened she disappeared as swiftly as a figment of a dream . I listened to the rumble of wheels on the cobblestonesgrowing fainter and lonelier until it died away . We played at Romsey and little Stockbridge . We tried hard , God knew  --  all of us resolved to retrieve our loss in the greatest possible measure  --  with the main result of overplaying our parts and giving a turgid performance . Annie , taking the star roles while Mrs. Reynolds took Annie 's , became pretentious and often silly . The audiences were cold . The " bright , particular star "   around whom we had revolved , that had shone on us and lighted us , was under the horizon . Another Shakespearean quotation that came often to my mind was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time I had lived to seemed broken , my hours of sleep passing slower than those of wakefulness , day feeling like night , and night like immortality , and sometimes whole reaches of the river passed by unseen . I was not always aware of missing Penny , but there was something wrong , a sense of ill-being , which suddenly exploded into the realization of her absence . My dreams were unutterably long and desolate . My teeth crumbled or came out in horrible clusters ; I saw the new moon through trees ; I walked in filth ; my legs ran while my body stood still ; a great ball swung on a chain . Once I was in the bliss of Penny 's arms , but Squire Blake of Breetholm came into the room and I was made impotent and ashamed . At Andover we were only a few hours ' walk from Silvester and Marthy 's beehouse , but I could not go there and ask them how they fared . It seemed to me certain that both had died in this long while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers gay and nectar-brimmed but unrejoiced , and the mead in the jar turning sour . However , we gave a better show at this little town , because tomorrow night we were due to be in Salisbury and read Penny 's letter . We were almost to Salisbury most of the afternoon , so skypiercingrose St. Mary 's spire . Our hearts rose with it . But it dimmed in the twilight before we gained the town , and the shadows lay grisly on the Plain . When we stopped at the Poultry Cross Inn , we formed a little , close group before we entered the door . Master Purdy wiped his face as though to rub off its freckles . " I 'm Mr. Purdy , " he told the innkeeper . " There 's a letter here for me . " " Who did you say you were ? " the fat man replied . " Tom Purdy . Our whole company  --  Purdy 's Players andP159Revelers  --  want to put up here . You ought to have a letter for me . " I doubt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's see . " He looked through a little pile of letters , then shook his head . That gesture seemed to take a long time and the room stood very still . " Then maybe there 's one for Dick Drury  --  Richard Drury . " " No , there ai n't . " " Have you any letters from Bristol for anyone ? " " No , Mr. Purdy , not a one . " " It should 've arrived by now ! Maybe the post was delayed  --  " Not that I 've heard of . But like enough ' twill be in tomorrow'spost . " We leaped to that prospect and turned it into a surety ; we saw the fat innkeeper as an authority on the post , liking and revering him . " Well  --  " Master Purdy turned to us , his face reddening . The time passed . Purdy told us a dozen times how easily a letter could have been delayed , and ingenious reasons that did not occur to him were convincingly put forward by Annie . All of us drank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed and quite gay when the coach from Bristol rolled into the courtyardthe next morning . We watched a postboy deliver half a dozen letters to our host . He knew we were watching him , his eyes and his hands and his mouth , as he began to glance through them . He had hardly started when he looked up and spoke in a surprised tone . " Well , here 's your letter , Mr. Purdy ! " The little man hastened forward . " With a handsome seal on it , too , I must say , " the innkeeper went on . Purdy broke that handsome seal and his eyes raced down the lines . Then those eyes , big and empty , turned to ours . " It 's not from Penny , " he said . " It 's from Sir Anthony Beach . "   " What ? " cried Jack Millford . " Give it here , " I heard myself say , and took the page , heavy and expensive-looking , from Purdy 's trembling hand . The precise handwriting read : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As Miss Price has no doubt joined you by now , she will explain the difficulty . Yr. obed. svt. , etc . Anthony Beach . " What do ye think o ' it , Dick ? " Purdy asked , in a shaking voice . " I do n't know what to think . All I know is  --  Penny has n't arrived . " " What 's the date of that letter ? " Jack broke in . " Monday . " " And this is Thursday morning . She ought to  --  " " Master Purdy , I 'm going to Bristol . " He drew a long breath . " I 'll not tell you no , but  --  " " How soon is there any conveyance to Bristol ? " I asked the innkeeper . " In a little o'er an hour . That 's cutting it fine , ai n't it ? " The fat man was quite pleased over the transportation facilities of his inn . " Master Purdy , you owe me a guinea , and I 'd like to sell my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Listen , Dick , " Mrs. Reynolds broke in . " You 're greatly upset , and we do n't blame you . But it 's not likely anything serious . She might be trying to make some other arrangements for us , and her letter was lost . She might have got sick  --  " " She 's never sick . Thank you , though  --  thank all of you . Will anybody buy my tenth share ? " " Do n't sell it , Dick , " Purdy cried . " I 'll pay you the guinea , P161and advance you two more , against the stock . " Plainly he had a secret horde . " Thanks , thanks . " " Steady , Dick , old boy , " said Annie . " I do n't see how anything could happen to her , " murmured Jack . " She 's no child , and she was going to stay at the Cabot Arms . Just the same  --  if you think we can help you , we 'll go with you . " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , and the money will go further . " We were now standing close together , talking in low tones . " We know Sir Anthony 's a fine gentleman , " Purdy said piteously . His loss was not so great as mine , yet stunning . " I do n't like the bastard 's letter , " dull Herbert Rutland broke out . So again the Company  --  what was left of it  --  stood quiet while a coach pulled out . They had told me they would go today to a small market town near Salisbury , and give some " ends " and burlesque ; thereafter they would write me , in care of the Cabot Arms . I did not travel as light as one might suppose , even taking my small make-up kit . Besides all my best clothes , I lugged some shabby , dirty ones used for scene shifting and the like  --  clothes not unbecoming such a man as Dick Fingers might have been , had he escaped the hangman until now . It had come to me that he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were no large towns on the turnpike between Salisburyand Bath . The lightest inquiry made to postboys and hostlers revealed that no pretty girl had ridden the eastbound coach in the last few days . At the big resort town , where we lay through the dark of night , I busied about the stables and the taproom until completely satisfied that Penny had not left Bristol in this direction . Arriving at the thronged city , I felt a sense of darkening fate . Bristol Annie , a woman I had cried to and been hushed by , had come from here . Likely it was Fiddling Fingers ' natal place , and what love or hate had driven hini forth to Cock Street ? Now a circle had come full . Against his command I had visited these scenes , but that was foreordained when he left me his fiddle , a magic fiddle . It had bought me my passage to Penny . Perhaps its music , heard in my infancy , had made me yearn to her song . That song still led me on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the love that had returned me here , in his place . Perhaps I would find hate too , ere I could depart , or perchance death . An ugly and ignoble port it seemed to me , but that was not the reason for my sharp premonition of evil . I went to the Cabot Arms , and in the role of a gentleman in reduced estate , asked for the cheapest room . Mr. Boggs , the innkeeper , looked at me down his thick nose , but I did not care for that , if I gained my point . " If economy is your aim , " said he , " belike you should put up at a less elegant inn . " " ' T is but one of my aims , " I answered . " Another is , to keep my fame among some great folk whom I know in the town , even though I 'm at present greatly pressed . " " My house is a good address , I grant ye , " the man smirked . " Not too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I replied . And already I knew enough about him not to like or trust him . Inn-keepers are famed as kindly , jolly , hearty souls , but we must not take the manner for the man . Many of them watch us eat , and hate us . The key to their affability is commonly made out of gold . He rubbed his coarse mouth with his coarse hand . " We have to be careful , " he explained . " Only last week we were taken in by a young person with a good front . " P163My heart stood still . There was no reason to think I was already on the trail , but a faint , sickening stench steamed up to my soul . I would not admit it was anything but the fumes of morbid , foolish fears . Every week or oftener in this fine tavern , some patron 's score was heavier than his purse . My mind was behaving strangely . It was desperately active and ingenious in discovering terrors , then cleverly laid them . Yes , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penny and caused him to mention her case  --  she so lived in me . But that same living would cause me to see her image everywhere . " I would n't think anyone as knowing as you would be taken in very often , " I remarked . " How did it happen ? " " No matter . We expect to be gulled occasionally . " " If you 've a room cheap enough , I 'll pay for a week 's lodging in advance . " " That 's my kind of talk . But the cheapest room  --  the very cheapest  --  is a tubby over the kitchen at sixpence per day . " It did for me perfectly , as I could go in and out the scullery door . Also I was bound to get well-acquainted with the servants . On my ringing for a chambermaid , fate promptly provided one to my specifications  --  pert , forward , pretty enough not to be astonished when gentlemen engaged her in conversation , always looking above her station . She was not too busy to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Janie , are there any young ladies staying at the inn as pretty as you ? " I asked her , after we had broken the ice with a few general remarks . " Ye can see for yourself , " she answered saucily . " If I 'd got here a week sooner , I 'd found one who would pass . " " Aye , you might . Which lady do ye mean ? " " At least she said she was coming here . A pretty filly I met on a stagecoach . Her name  --  let me see  --  was Price . " Janie 's mouth opened with excitement . I made my face as still as my heart .   " Why , she 's the one what had her pocket picked ! " " What ? " " So she said , and I believed her . Some of the ' elp thought ' t was a trick to get out o ' paying her score , but I believed ary word o ' it . " " Why , tell me about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a gentleman paid her a call and had dinner wi ' her . A very fine gentleman too , but I 'll not gi ' his name , for ' t is agin ' the rule of the house , and ' t would be enough to cost me my post . " " I would n't ask you for his name . " " Well , the very next evening she came in crying . Her purse had been picked o ' more than two guineas , so she swore . " " What happened then ? " " Why , Mr. Boggs , he turned her out , o ' course . I do n't know where she went , when she left here . " I had to say something . When a cue is missed , something must be said at any cost . But before I could manage it , Janie spoke . " Ye must ha ' met more'n on a stagecoach , for ye to turn so white . " A rat can turn and dodge very quickly , and we raised in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any strong relationshipbetween Penny and me to be suspected by anyone , let alone this gossipy housemaid . I employed a device of which Jerry could have boasted to his Jollies  --  ready at hand , it seemed . Quickly I rushed to my satchel , opened it , felt its lining , then stood erect , grinning with feigned relief . " I just remembered that villainous-looking porter , who handiedmy bag , " I told the girl . " I was afraid he 'd robbed me . " " Why , flog me for a slut ! " " It was n't much  --  you can judge that by the look of this room  --  but more than I wanted to lose . " " Why , I thought ye must be mighty sweet on the young ' . lady , " Janie remarked , laughing .   " Just the same , I feel sorry for her . What could she do , in a city like Bristol , without any money ? " " She had a little siller in her kerchief . Two or three groat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crooked sixpence . " I remembered the sixpence well . " Then I guess she could go to a cheap inn for the night , " I said . " I reckon she did . Mr. Boggs gave her the names o ' some . " " By the way , what is a cheap one , if my business here takes longer than I think ? " " You 'll scarce find any , less ' n sixpence a day . Maybe ye could stay at the Crossed Anchors for a groat . " This last with a curled lip . " Not while you 're chambermaid here , Janie . " " Well , they say I do n't drive off no custom . " " What o'clock is it ? " " After ten , and time I went about my work . " I gave her a loutish hug , for I might need her later , and in good spirits she withdrew . My next business was not to visit the Crossed Anchors  --  that chance would be too long  --  but to call on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only at the first moment of my loss had I proposed to go straight to Sir Anthony Beach . After a very little thought  --  or , rather , reverie  --  it had come to me that he might be one of the last people I would go to , and then with great care . It was not that I was reluctant to bother the great man . Like Herbert , I had not liked his letter . Dressed in my best , and wearing my best manners , I made inquiries at a nearby wine merchant as to where to find Mr. Chichester , and was told that the Merchant Venturers ' Coffee House would be a likely place , since he was directing their festivalbeing held this week . This warmed my heart a little , since news of the festival was one note in harmony with our first hope-laden plans . Meanwhile I took care not to look at the piteous figment of my girl , leaving the Cabot Arms with a crooked sixpence clutched in her hand in the gray and sinister dusk . But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the night we were to have played The Merchant of Venice  --  a fit choice , quoth Sir Anthony ! Then he had looked embarrassed . Perhaps that play was not in our repertoire ? That would be most unfortunate ! Why , cried Purdy eagerly , his face tomato-red , we had given it right here in Brighton only a year before ! Give me an ounce of Civet , good apothecary , to sweeten my imagination ! At the coffeehouse I found Mr. Chichester without trouble . Fate was being very kind to me , at this stage of my search  --  almost too kind . He was a tall , lean man , with hollow cheeks and a nervous manner . I would have been inclined to like and trust him at first blush , if I had not been done with that sort of thing . When I asked if he would have coffee with me at a private table , and talk a little business , he agreed courteously . " My name is Drury , " I told him , " and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Players and Revelers . " " I 've heard of ' em , " Mr. Chichester replied . " A good troupe , I believe . " " We think so . I 'd like to have you keep them in mind as possibilities for your theater . " I said " them " not " us " to convey the idea that I was an owner only , not an actor . If later it seemed best to reveal the truth , he would not remember which pronoun I had used . " But my main business is to inquire for one of the actresses who came to Bristol expecting to see you . " " What was her name ? " " Penny Price , a singer and all-round star . " " No one of that name has called on me . " " I thought the arrangement was that you were going to meet her Friday or Saturday , a week ago . She was to be introduced toP167you by a very prominent person here , I believe  --  Sir Anthony Beach . " Mr. Chichester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have brightened , I thought , if only at the sound of this well-known name ; when it did not , I got the idea that for some reason he had frozen it by a distinct effort of will . He took a sip of coffee . " Did Sir Anthony Beach say he was going to present her to me ? " he asked , in casual tones . " Yes , " I replied , in something the same tones . " He saw her play at Brighton and seemed much impressed by her . He said that he believed you might like to have her perform in the festival . In fact , he told us that you had asked him to keep his eye open for talent for your theater . " " Doubtless I did , although I do n't remember it . I do recall his remarking that on his travels he might discover some talent , but I thought he was joking . " " Did you plan on having a permanent company here ? " " No , sir . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Price . " " Not that I recall . " " Then that concludes my business . She failed to return to the Company , and frankly , I was eager to talk to her and try to persuade her to do so . " " You know how these players are . Here today , gone tomorrow . " Then if you have no suggestions  --  " " Why do n't you inquire of Sir Anthony ? " He spoke in a curiously guarded tone . " Well , I was reluctant to approach him , until I found out whether or not you had employed her . I understand he is a man of great affairs . " " Yes , he is . That 's quite true . He owns the West Africa and Indies Trading Company . They have a considerable fleet of black-cargo ships . " " Black cargo ! " " Well , I suppose you know it 's the slaves that pay for the sugar . They catch ' em in Africa and trade ' em for the sweet in the West Indies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His expression changed subtly ; his voice fell . " Just the same  --  every time I put some in my coffee , I 'm surprised it does n't stink . " " Is it true that Sir Anthony once captained his own ship ? " I asked , fiddling with my spoon . " Quite true , I believe . But it did n't pay him very well  --  he lost so much of his cargo  --  and wisely turned the job over to underlings , while he tended to the sugar end of the business . Still  --  they say that once slaving gets in a man 's blood , it do n't die out . " I would sell out now my most hopeful solution of the mystery for the certain knowledge that Penny was a prisoner to Sir Anthony somewhere in Bristol . If so , I could get her back . No matter what fees her jailor had charged , she would have in the course of nature taken no harm that my love could not cure . But I did not possess this knowledge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the notion at all . Certainly she was not in his mansion on Avonbank , where he and his wife entertained the nobility and gentry . Anyway I could not believe that he would move so boldly outside the law . So I would not go to see him yet . Instead I talked with porters and grogsellers on the waterfront , to learn what I could about him without showing any lively concern , and especially to discover the resorts of the leading land-rats and footpads of the city . It was a conviction with me now that the pocket-picking which had lost her the shelter of the Cabot Arms was no casual crime . Toward evening I went to the Crossed Anchors , but PennyP169had not been there . A rat-toothed pimp told me so , when I pretended to be seeking a girl of her description for my use . Yet I was helped on my way . " Who 's the top-dog pimp in town ? " I had asked . " Why do ' ee want to know ? " he responded . I showed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I might want his help , in picking a cherry . " " Well , they say that Gun Jones can get ' ee a duchess , if ' ee 'll pay his fee . " I handed him the coin , and held another  --  this time a crown  --  where he could see it twinkle . " Pimping aside , who 's top-dog ? " I asked . His rat-eyes grew brighter and sharper . " Why do ' ee want to know ? " he asked again . " I 'd charge you a pound for that . " " A runt-croker who do n't want his neck slit , do n't tell all ' ee knows . " I had n't heard that term , a peculiarly obscene one , for many years . It was once well-known to Jerry 's Jollies . " The baskets already know who 's top dog . I want to know too . " Baskets meant hoppers , thus coppers , by the thieves ' cryptographemployed all over England . " ' Ee 's well-posted , for a toff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'er the fence that Billy Clews do n't get smell of . " " Would I see him tonight at the Capstan Rest ? " This was the name of a thieves ' resort close by the Sugar Dock . " I 'm not paying for the tip : it 's man 's to man . " " Since ' ee puts it that way , ' ee might , and again ' ee might n't . But I 'll tell ' ee straight it 's no good place for a toff with a heavy purse . " I took no heavy purse there , only one gold guinea pinned under my belt where no pickpocket 's finger would find it , and a shilling or two in my pocket . For that matter , I took no toff there either , but left him in my room with my good clothes . Those that I wore would fit Dick Fingers ; the mind that my soul wore was instinct of him . I was not nervous over playing the part , it seemed so real . I went out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rest was of itself a more interesting place than I had expected . Its benches and tables were of teakwood , brought from the farther Indies , and likely once the strakes of a Portuguesegalleon , wrecked in Avonmouth ; and their handier surfaces had a silken look in the lamplight , from being polished by the beautifying hand of long use . One of the lamps was blue porcelainand had no doubt been brought from China . Its light flung up and died in an ever-shifting haze of tobacco smoke , proof that no penny-snatchers frequented the resort , for such could not afford the ever-glowing pipes . Behind the bar was a picture of a mermaid , meditating over a drowned sailor on a reef  --  painted by a superb artist when either mad or drunk . The room was quieter than its wont , I believed , as I entered ; but when its little natural noises began again , they were never loud . Long ago I had learned to look at people with the side of my eyes . It did not take me long to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his manner indicated his position , and so did the frequent , intense glances of his companions . It did not have much doubt that the small , dark , square-faced , beaknosedman was Billy Clews . When the tapster put down my second tot of rum , I deliberatelydropped it on the floor . The small clatter drew every eye . Then , turning to the tables with what passed for a humorous shrug , I gazed straight at the little captain and drew my hand back and forth across my eyebrows . To the unitiated it appeared an unconscious gesture , but unless I missed my guess , to Billy Clews it was a sign fairly well up in the masonry of thieves . At the outset it seemed not very likely that pickpockets , pimps , landrats , roadknights , and the rest would indulge in such hocus-pocus but , in the first place , it was useful  --  the signals had saved many a rat about to be trapped  --  and , in the second place , it gave a little cheap romance to their sordid lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew of chivalry , had turned many a trapped rat into a man . Why had I given it so publicly ? Because I wanted others here who knew it to see it passed to their leader . No matter what he found out about me now , or how treacherous his nature was , he would not dare peach me . The least suspicion that he had turned king 's evidence against one who had so addressed him would cost him the last shred of his honor among thieves . He could not even murder me , without having to stand trial in the beggars ' court for fratricide . Only a few minutes later he rose and sauntered to the bar where I was standing . " A stranger round here , I take it , " he told me . His accents were somewhat better than most thieves ' . " I 'm Billy Clews . " " I 'm Jerry , of Jerry 's Jollies , from the Town . " " I thought you was from London . Well , come with me . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind me . From an unlocked chest he drew a bottle of fine French brandy and two crystal goblets . When we had drunk , cordially enough , his face turned to flint . " Well , what do you want ? " he growled . " All you 'll tell me about Sir Anthony Beach . " His eyebrows rose at that . " He 's very rich , and cupmate to the lord high sheriff , " he answered gruffly . " I already knew that . " " What makes you think I know anything more about him ? I grant you , sometimes people know more than they should  --  even signs they 've got no right to . " " Shake hands with me , Billy Clews . " When he had done so , he nodded . " All right , but you better tell me why you want to know , so I can specify in my answers . If it 's a haul , you 're poaching , in the first place , and fixing to get stretched , in the second . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was , why would I swing ? " " Because he 's high , and strong , and vengeful as a snake . You 'd think to look at his pretty face and baby mouth that heP172would n't hurt a flea , but I 'd rather have Lord Jeffreys after me , than Sir Anthony Beach . " The bloody judge had been dead fifty years , but his black flame still lived in the West Country . " There was a chimney sweep , one time , who came down into his parlor and lifted a pretty glass dish , " Billy Clews told me , with small , glassy eyes . " Sir Anthony went to his hanging , talking sweet and wise the whole time . Long before that , there was a sailor who 'd stole a silver-mounted pistol from his cabin , and hid out . Sir Anthony set after him like a country squire a fox , save that his dogs was thieves too , set to catch a thief . Well , the tar shot himself with that same gun , ' cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand it again . " " Do you mean , Billy Clews , that he got the like of us to catch the like of us ? " I asked . " That do n't surprise you . If you do n't know by now how cheap you can buy peaches , you 're a blind fool . The king 's men would ' ve never nabbed the sailor . He knew every hole and corner of the waterfront . But the lads could tell them where to look , and Sir Anthony throwed his gold like slop , till he got his revenge . " He has land-rats working for him now ? " " At his beck and call . " Those same land-rats had been becked and called only last week , I knew , but I did not ask their names . If I had done so , Billy Clews would have quietly closed his leathern-looking mouth , contemptuous as well as afraid of talking to such a fool . " Is he highborn ? " I asked . " They say he comes from an ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth are often two different things . " " Well , then , I 'd wager you he flew out of a dungheap , forall he was captain of a slaver at twenty-one . I once knew a highWelsh lady who 'd fallen low . She said he was Cardiff riffraff . " " What are his weaknesses ? " " He 's not got any . " " Every man has . "   " Well , what he wants , he wants devilish bad . Maybe that 's a weakness , but more often it 's a strength . No amount of money or trouble is too high a price . " I could believe that readily . " Does he get reckless ? " " He might . Anyhow he 's been known to overreach himself . They tell on the docks why he gave up slaving  --  at first hand , I mean  --  when he loved it so . He 'd load his ship so full of niggers that half would die from crowding and plague before he made the West Indies . He 'd pile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sink the vessel . He could n't stand to leave any that he might own . And when they 'd cheat him by dying , he 'd swell up like a poisoned pup with rage and spite . ' ' " How about women ? " I asked quietly . Billy 's hard mouth turned down at the corners in a sardonic smile . " Now we 're getting to it . " " Are n't they his weak spot ? " " No more than I 've told you . But they might be his Achilles ' heal  --  at last . " The classical simile did not sound strange on this thief-king 's tongue , and the augury struck me as well-grounded . " I take it , he wants ' em when he wants ' em just as hard , and is just as vengeful if they escape . Is that right , Billy ? " " Why ask me about him , when you know him so well , Mr. Jerry ? " " But why should he go to great trouble for any girl , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cheap ? " " The harder they are to get , the more he prizes ' em . If one takes his fancy  --  and he 's a fine eye , I 'll say that for him  --  there 's no trouble , no meanness , no cost he wo n't go to . She might as well fall over at the start . " " He saw a girl he wanted in Brighton , about a fortnight ago . He had her come to Bristol , pretending he 'd put her on the stage . She arrived on Friday , with three guineas , and stayed at the Cabot Arms . On Saturday night  --  a week ago  --  her pocket was picked , the inn threw her out , and she disappeared . "   " Yes , there 's some that wo n't fall over even for Sir Anthony Beach , " Billy Clews remarked , his eyes oddly bright . " You 're right about that . " " She was a beauty , I reckon . " " Yes . " " Why did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If I had , and then told you that the man was Sir Anthony Beach , I doubt if you 'd talked so free about him . " " You 're no fool . I 'm wondering now if I have n't talked too rash . " " Could you find her for me , if she 's still alive ? " " I could , maybe , but I wo n't . I like my neck . " " Would you venture an opinion what might have happened to her ? " " Anything might have happened , after she was cleaned . She might have given up , and is laying up somewhere for his con-venience . " " No , I wish it was so , but it 's not . " " Then it 's a pay-back job for her thwarting him , and I 'm sorry for you both . " " Would he have had her murdered ? " " He might , but if ' t were known he had her come here , ' t would be too risky . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will you help me find out what he did to her ? " Billy Clews drained his glass , and sat looking at it . " You gave me the sign and the handshake , " he remarked thoughtfully . " You won ' em honest , I doubt not , and it 's plain you 've been through the mill . But I 'd hazard you 've come a long ways since then , in spite of the clothes . you 're wearing . " " Not so far that they do n't fit me . " " Have you got plenty of money ? " " Very little , but I can get more . " " I know somebody who 'd find out for you , easy . He probablyknows already who picked the girl 's pocket  --  I think I do too , for that matter  --  a former steward on one of Sir Anthony'sp175ships , and dirty as they come . But the most this friend of mine would do would wisen you up  --  not raise a finger to help you  --  and for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have only two , but I 'll pay him a third in a few days . " " I 'll make him do it for two , I reckon . " " Thanks , Billy Clews . How long will it take ? " " Maybe he can let you know tomorrow night . " " That 's too long . I want to know tonight . It 's barely ten o'clock . " " I felt that way once about a bitch , and she peached me . All right . Stay right here . Maybe he can find out tonight , maybe he ca n't . Anyhow , he 'll try . " Up until now I had had no time to think  --  or perhaps I should say do anything but think . I had been so occupied with the problem itself , my mind so obsessed by it , that my fancies had little strength or time to rove , and Sorrow stood only at the doorway , waiting for admittance . But I did not like being left alone , with nothing to do . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Barbarossan sleep  --  if my spirit would consent to close its fevered eyes ; and I dared not put myself out with brandy , in case some crisis rose . It came to me too that I would like to die . Never before had the simplicity of the solution struck me : to be as though I had never been , hence all that was regrettable had never happened . I t would be like waking to find that a bad dream had been only a dream . My longing for death was like a powerful guilty lust such as a good man might have in reverie for his little niece , which he knows he will never gratify , but whose act he contemplates with a frightened titillation . I had a knife and could slit my veins , I thought . When Billy Clews returned , I would be lying in a red puddle and he would swear at the trouble I had caused him , but trouble would be a word I did not know.  | Better yet , I could hang myself with my belt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in jig time  --  a suitable end for Dick Fingers , and fair enough . The few seconds ' agony of strangulation would be a reasonably severe penalty for the debts I had left unpaid . Of course neither of these courses was open to me , or would be for a good while yet . I sat there for the bulk of five hours , only occasionally rising to stretch my legs . When nature 's need became too great to bear , I could not bring myself to leave the cubby against Clews 's instructions  --  toobey him to the letter had become a superstitious compulsion  --  so I used a beer pail that I found . However , I had hit upon a means to make the time pass  --  neither swiftly nor happily , but at least draw me a little nearer to Clews 's return . It was to live over every scene with Penny that I could recall , and in as complete detail as the full strength of my mind could encompass . I remembered the first kiss she had given me , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her gleaming on the stage when she recited the prologue to The Country Wife ; I thought of her and me entertaining the bumpkins , while the rest of the Company fled out the rear door ; she had wanted to sleep in the grass when we had hidden from three fast-riding horsemen , but we had gone on to Silvester and Marthy 's beehouse . If that old couple yet lived , they had likely forgotten our visit , for aged folk have short memories for recent events , although still harboringthings of long ago ; yet perhaps there came a faint , pleasant humming in their ears , like bees swarming a long way off , when on happy occasions they shared a cup of mead . The horsemen had won or lost their race , and the nags were stiff-jointed or in the boneyard . The yokels who had watched the free show did not wonder about it any more ; and someday I would not wonderabout Penny 's beauty or what star from which she fell . Tonightthe Company had played in some little barn or courtyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bright costumesinto the chests , counting up the money . At three o'clock in the morning there came a tap on my door . When I opened it , in walked not Billy Clews , but a larger and far more commonplace figure . No , if one could see him at all , instead of looking through him , he was too featureless to be commonplace . It required an actual effort to be aware of his countenance , coloring , and raiment , they were so neuter . He looked as if God had made him while thinking of something else , using the cheapest materials without the slightest decorative touch to please him and help sell him . No doubt he had the component parts that make up a man , the Master 's hands throwingthem together from habit , but they were for no one 's use or remembrance but his own . Yet he was a man who could see a good deal without being seen . " Are you Jerry ? " he muttered . " Yes . " " I 'm Dick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be me , for all I knew . It was as easy to imagine him being me as being anyone . " All right , Dick . " " Top dog sent me to ye . " " Did you find out what I wanted to know ? " " Maybe I did , maybe I did n't . Have you got them two guineas ? " " I 've one of ' em with me , and I 'll pay it to you now . When you 've told me what I want to know , I 'll go get the other for you . " " I want ' em both ' fore I open my lip . " " I have n't them both , I told you , on me . " " Then I 'll see you later . " He turned to go out the door . I seized him by the shoulder . Instead of jerking away , he stood dead still . That was the way he went through life , I think . Afterwhile whoever had seized him would forget him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had perceived him not as an anonymity , but as a courier bringing tidings of my soul 's life and death . " Here 's the guinea , " I said , jerking the coin with my free hand from under my belt . " I 've promised you the other , one hour after I leave here . Now tell me what you know , or I 'll choke it out of you . " " Aye , Mr. Jerry , " he replied , his eyes filming over . " Did you know that in old days , messengers who brought bad news were killed ? " " Ow , " he grunted , his eyes wobbling . " No matter how bad the news is , I 'll pay you in full , as I promised . But if you hold anything back , or tell me one lie , I 'll kill you too dead to skin . " " 0 good God ! Like enough I 'll be done in anyhow , for mere smelling his tracks . " The man drew a long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll tell ye . " Weak-kneed , he sat down in my chair . I took the one Billy Clews had occupied , and stared at his lips from which his news would presently emerge . " Out with it , " I told him . " The girl had her pocket picked , as ye said . It was done by one o ' the big gun 's men , but do n't make me gi ' his name , for I do n't know it for certain , and I 'm afeared to . " " His name does n't matter to me , at present . If it ever does , I 'll come to you . What then ? " " She had n't gone six blocks from the Cabot Arms , after she was told to leave , when a gentleman  --  leastways he looked like one  --  raised a cry on the street that she 'd lifted his purse off ' m . " " What did you say ? " It was not that he had failed to speak loudly enough ; instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question , I had not been sufficiently braced against the answer , so I must hold it out of my brain until I armed myself . But there was nothing to arm myself with . Rage would be so impotent , so unworthy . The man called Dick repeated what he had said almost word for word . He was a patient fellow . By patience he could wait and wait , until he saw everything . " Who was the man ? " I asked . " I do n't know , and tha 's Jesus ' truth . It could be any one o ' a score that handles such things for him . The lads had seen him at the big gun 's heels afore then , but did n't know him from a sack o ' salt . He 's not one of our kind . " " Did he call for a constable ? " " Aye. , , " Did the copper search her ? " " Aye . " " Did he find any of the gentleman 's belongings on her ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of the crowd found it lying in the gutter , where he said she 'd throwed it . But the gentleman said she 'd lifted his good-luck piece too  --  a crooked sixpence  --  and sure ' nough she had one in her hand , crooked like he said . " " She said it belonged to her ? " I asked , after a pause . " Aye , she said so , ' twixt her crying . " " Was the crowd with her , or against her ? " " Some was sorry for her , for she was a pretty'n , and dressed lady-like , but some said that was the worst kind o ' picker and stealer , and hanging was too good for the like o ' her , and aped and mocked her . " Beasts , monsters , lower than curs , viler than rats , more wicked than wolves in the woods ! " Was she arrested ? " " She was sure to be that . " " What jail was she taken to ? " For my heart was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter what jail she was in , I would get her out . I would prove the crooked sixpence was her own  --  prove she was innocent . I would get help from Sir Charles Willow and Sir John Sendall ; I would call in my old Jollies from London to scourP180for evidence , a last knightly emprize . The wrong would be righted , and my love would cure her wound . " To Bristol Newgate . " But when I started to speak , I perceived that my informant also had been about to speak  --  to add something to his last remark , and for some reason had hesitated . " What is it ? " I asked , slowly and carefully . " That 's all I know . " " Tell me the rest of it , man . " " What 'll ye do ? It wo n't be something ye want to hear . Will ye hurt me ? " " No , I wo n't hurt you , before God . " " She ai n't in Newgate now . " " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's God 's truth . She stayed only till Mondaymorn , in the woman 's room , then the warden let her out . " " Why did he ? Do n't be afraid . Speak calmly . " The man was gray-faced and shaking . " Well , it might be because the gentleman  --  leastways he looked like one  --  did n't appear agin her ' fore the magistrate . Sometimes they do let ' em out , when no one ' pears agin ' em , even that soon . They had n't put no iron on her yet , so e'en if she had no money  --  to pay the ironing fee , which she did n't owe  --  they might ha ' let her go . " " Yes , so they might , but that 's not what you think . " " Well , I heard when she left the jail , she had a cloth on her face . " " I do n't understand . " " It was a bandage , like . " " Yes , I suppose it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I heard ' t was an accident . The turnkey , one o ' the trusties , he 'd brought in a bucket o ' the stuff they use to clean the opensewers and stop some o ' the stink . It 's said to keep jail feverdown , but there 's always plenty o ' it , just the same . Well , heP181was trying to put some high on the wall , and it splashed bad , and flung on her face and burned it . " After endless ages among the damned , I heard myself ask : " Well , where did she go ? " " That 's what I do n't know . " " Is that true ? It had better be true . " " She went out the gate , and nobody I know seen her after that . Maybe I could find out for ye , but ' t is all I know up to now , or ye can kill me . " " I wo n't hurt you , man . I 'll get you that other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You said you thought it was an accident  --  theburning part . Are you sure ? " " Fair sure . The turnkey he burned hisself bad on the foot with the acid . ' T would be hard to do a-purpose , e'en for the big gun . I ' low ' t was an accident . " " Well , it does n't make any difference anyway . " After leaving the jail , Penny had dropped from sight like a pebble cast from the cliffs of Dover . All the next day and deep into the night , Billy Clews , a score of more of his foxes , and the spy called Dick searched for her . Although they did not sniff the tracks of Sir Anthony Beach and only one or two of Billy 's intimates knew the great man was involved  --  the thief-king had looked me in the eyes and agreed that this was best  --  the quest , was remarkably thorough . No girl with a burned or bandaged face could have disappeared so utterly unless she were deliberately hiding or had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house in the city , and if she had left Bristol it was by no public conveyance . The last seen of her was on Monday afternoon . An apothecarynear Horse Fair had been asked by a young , bright-haired girl wearing a bandage whether a penny would buy any balm for a severe burn . He had replied it would not , but he offered to examine the injury , and on removing the bandage , told her that he would apply an emollient free of charge . She had asked if the burn would cause large and disfiguring scars ; sorrowfully he had answered in the affirmative . She had pressed her penny on him , before taking her leave and vanishing in the thronged street . " Well-grounded hope is a sweet , tender thing , " Billy Clews told me in his council room , when all the reports were in . Kingshipgives nobility to a man , even if his subjects are only beggars and thieves : I was not surprised by his language . " But hoping against hope is black misery . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " I 'll find out from him . " " I would n't envy you the job . " " I see its difficulties . It will take planning and , worse , take time , but he 'll tell me . " " That 's crazy talk . There 's no way under the sun you can reach him  --  there would n't be , if you was ten times as high , ten times as strong . What can even the sheriff prove against him ? That he invited the girl to Bristol , and had supper with her  --  not a jot more . She was turned out of the Cabot Arms . She was arrested on the street as a pickpocket . She was freed from jail when no one appeared against her . Well ? " " I know all that , but I 'll reach him . " " Suppose you do . Suppose he tells you all he knows . What have you got ? " I shook my head . " I 'll tell you , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most like . Look at it , Jerry . Maybe he had her killed . He would , if something had happened we do n't know about , to make her dangerous to him . " I knew a thing that had happened that made her dangerous to him  --  her loving me . But that was not what Billy meant . " Maybe she saved him the trouble , " Billy murmured , looking at the table . " She loved life , " I said . " She would n't kill a chicken . "   " Those that love life the most wo n't stand to have it insulted . I 've never seen the girl , but she was no common jade , to put that look in your eyes . " Avoiding his eyes , I chanced to see the beam over our heads . If I had used it , it would be like waking up to find that a bad dream was only a dream . But in brooding about lost chances , we forget the strings on them . If we had opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be different with us  --  but not having been certain what lay within , and so busy with other things , we need n't be too regretful , for it had amounted to the door 's being locked . " What would you do in my place ? " I asked . " I might take the law in my own hands . " " How would that help the girl , if she 's still alive ? " " I would n't think about that . I would n't think about my deck either  --  I hope . " " Well , I 've got to go ahead the best I can . Will you let me poach one night in your park , for the money I need while I 'm waiting . " " Hark to me , Jerry . Do n't you know if you wait  --  if you fool around trying to put screws on him  --  you wo n't find the girl , you 'll find yourself kicking on a rope , and he 'll get off scot-free ? " " It sounds reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on you , to hang for your own sweetheart 's murder ? He 'd dearly love to turn a trick like that . " " A fine finish , would n't it be ? " " Would you give him his life , if he gives you back the girl ? " " If there 's no other way . " " Who are you , in God 's name ? A common thief from London , you said  --  an unknown actor . You might be more , but at most who are you to talk of bargaining with the big gun 's life ? " " I do n't know who I am . " " I 'll tell you . I 'm the king of thieves but you 're the king of fools . "   Wo n't you be one with me , Billy Clews ? I 'm all alone now . Wo n't you at least give me your queer , crooked blessing ? But I can not ask you . " Well , it 's nothing to me , " he went on . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you wanted me in it , I 'd laugh at you . I got where I am by having no heart . Do you understand ? " " I wo n't ask you . " " I 'm the son of a whore by a low-grade pimp . I did n't get where I am by borrowing troubles . But you can poach what you need in my park . " " Many thanks . " " My boys will think it 's Hook Hopper 's gang  --  they 're water-rats from Cardiff who visit us sometimes . I suppose your fingers are still light , and your nose keen ? " The last remark he made in an idle tone . " The craft will come back to me , " I told him . " I need n't ask you to be as careful as you can . You 're crooked as Crawley Brook . But when you 're stretched , I do n't want to be harried and hustled and bothered by my rival , the king of England . " He smiled faintly . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd better not meet again . " " I 'm sorry to lose your company , " Billy told me with a slight , sardonic bow , " but that would be best . " " However , I 'll drop in here the night I 'm ready , and you can do what you see fit about covering up . " " That 's gentlemanly of you , and I 'll thank you kindly . " None of the personal hazards of my enterprise that Billy Clews had pointed out preyed on my mind . I meant to take all practical measures to reduce or avoid them , but apparently I had slipped a little way around the corner from reality as far as my own fate was concerned , where there were soft and mitigating footlights instead of the remorseless sun . P185What did unnerve me were the necessary delays . High though he sat , fortified by his wealth , secure in his cunning , still Sir Anthony Beach would be a little worried over his affair with Penny , and I should give him at least a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay down a little of his guard . Anyway I needed that much time to lay my plans . I needed to know his usual comings and goings , his favorite resorts of pleasure , every possible loop in his armor . Every move upon him must be made with forethought and care . If Penny was alive , I could not bear to think of her waiting any longer for me to come , but if I slipped she would wait forever in vain . Compared to these urgencies , the lifting of enough money for my wants would be a trivial and it seemed enjoyable adventure , like comic relief just before the catastrophe in a play . I chose the second night after my last talk with Billy , and the simplest of stratagems . Indeed , if I had had my way , there would have been no stratagem at all , only a quick brush against some fine-feather buck in a crowd , and a gentle separation between him and his wallet , but I had lost my touch . Picking pockets and slitting purses requires as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry of " Stop , thief ! " raised is harrowingas well as frightening to the artist-dip : he can not bear the sight and sound of pain . My clumsy hand in a gentleman 's pocket would be like salt in an open wound . At the taproom of the inn I had observed a bloated lordling known as Beau Bevis . His purse was thick , and his head likewise unless I missed my guess : he enjoyed abusing and humiliating the barmaids and everyone else who could not fight back . Thus he would be a pleasure to rob ; and because he was a creature of slavelike regularity of habit , he should be easy prey . In discussing various patrons , Janie had mentioned how he always arrived at the tavern , attended to his pleasures , and departed as if by clockwork . No doubt he prided himself upon this self-discipline , when truly he was a marionette of Time . It had its grossly amusing side . Janie had told me that after his tippling , he invariably paid a call on his mistress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inn . Evidently he had told her he would be there every night at eleven sharp , and the poor fool was . It could well be convenient for her , if she had other lovers on her string , and it promised to be most convenient for me . The hall was dim , narrow , and at this hour , ordinarily deserted . I had thought to lay for him on his way home , but my chances of success would be much greater if I intercepted him on this mechanically amorous errand . At a quarter to the hour I went up the servants ' stairs to my room and changed my best coat and breeches to garments suitable to Jerry of Jerry 's Jollies . Also I changed my face in a way that old troupers know  --  indeed , was better at it than most buffoons , for having Tom Purdy as my teacher  --  so that no acquaintance could recognize me without a searching glance , or yet perceive any sign of disguise . It was a matter of a slight deepening of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a redrawing of the eyebrows . For good measure I caused my hair to look like a wig , and darkened the purse beneath my left eye , as though from a blow in a brawl . It was no such plastering and painting as London actors practice . In fact the modern metropolitan theater , with its tricky lighting and high stage disjoined from the audience , is bringing about the death of the art of make-up . We strolling players , often in arms ' reach of the benches and frequently performing in broad daylight , were its real custodians and masters . About five minutes to the hour I climbed to the third floor and took my stand close by the lady 's door . No doubt she was putting the final touches to her own disguise , that of a languishingand lovely paramour , meanwhile scheming how much she could milk him for . His purse will be thin tonight , my pretty , or I miss my guess ! Thinking of the boring business waiting her , thinking of him virtuously slogging up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsettled myself . Perhaps I would not have been anyway even though this was the first felony I had undertakenP187in seven years . So little myself mattered , compared to my necessity , the irons and the dock and the stern judge and the austere gallows all changing to shadows . But it was a comfort to be grinning while I waited , even if that grin were fixed and sour . As by the law of the Medes and the Persians , he came clumping down the hall . I went forth to meet him , a broom that I had found in a corner over my shoulder . Lowering this respectfullyas he drew near , I squeezed against the wall and stooped to him , for only gentlemen may bow . If he were the proprietor of this inn , he was thinking , the maids and dustman would do their work on rigid schedule , and not be getting in the guests ' way at all hours . As he passed by , exhaling sharply so not to smell me and breathe my dust , I hit him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jaw . Since it was an undercut that lifted him a little before it felled him , I had time to catch him before he struck the floor . The total noise was no greater than if he had had one cup too many and stumbled against the wall ; if his sweetheart had heard it , she would strike a pretty pose . I had found his purse before he was well settled in his nap , and was promptly dashing down the back stairs to my cubby . The danger of meeting anyone was remote at this time of night , and my luck held . In a brevity of time that only fellow troupers could believe , I had donned my gentlemanly clothes and restored the customary aspect of my countenance . Then I sped down the stairs , out the scullery door , and dropping the Beau 's now languished purse in the courtyard , entered the main taproom door . It was fully five minutes later that a pale-faced chambermaid brought startled tidings to the innkeeper . He had been charmed with the jingle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Warning the girl to secrecy  --  his signals were a shade more subtle than a barnstorming actor 's  --  he bustled from the room . Later the loquacious Janie gave me a graphic account of the whole affair . Why , a girl was not safe in her bed ! The lady , Madam DeVille , had waited for the poor gentleman for more than fifteen minutes before she chanced to open the door and saw him lying in the hall , and at that supposed he had merely tossed too many pots ! Only when by chance she discovered that his purse was missing-she had been trying to revive him , Janie explained  --  did she perceive that he had been robbed and alarmed the house . Even when revived and questioned , he more sputteredthan spoke , he was that vexed ! " Have they caught the rogue yet ? " I asked . " No , but the law 's on his trail . At first the gentleman thought it might be one o ' us survants  --  maybe a hostler or stableboy  --  maybe e'en a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the boys afore him , to try to recognize the villain , for all Mr. Boggs told him none of ' em had a black eye . " " Did the knave have a black eye ? " " ' T was about all Mr. Bevis remembered about him , that and his ugly jib , and hard , low look . Hanging was too good for ' m , the gentleman swore  --  he ought to be drawn and quartered . Then he demanded Mr. Boggs search all the guests , and their rooms too , which would have fair ruined the house , if Mr. Boggs had stood for't . E'en at that , ' e made him walk with him through the taproom , looking for the rogue . " I recalled the incident . It had seemed to me that as Beau Bevis 's angry eyes had brushed over the crowd , they had halted briefly on mine . " As if such a ruffian could go by the doorman ! " Janie snorted . " The gentleman must have been out of his head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t was a footpad , who sneaked up the servants ' stairs . Still  --  there 's many a wolf in sheep 's clothing ! " " Did the gentleman lose much ? " I asked , to take her mind off this dangerous track . " O'er ten pounds . " I had to respect Beau Bevis 's honesty . Jerry 's Jollies were constantly being outraged by reports of losses from three to fiveP189times as large as we knew to be fact . This gentleman had only doubled the amount . As for my own honesty  --  what I had done did not seem to concern it in the least . Whether Penny would have wanted me to do it , I had no thought or care , it was such a trivial detail of my task . Still she might have been amused by this interruption of Beau Bevis 's precious schedule , while Madam DeVille primped and pouted in turn . . . Ghostly and little and far-off I heard her welling laughter . The horseplay had played out , and so had my lying fancies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not heard my coarse jests ; if from where she had gone she raised any cry , it was not laughter . 0 voices in the night , be still ! Today I must pay my first visit to Sir Anthony Beach . By no means as ready for him as I would like , still the time had seemed very long . Anyway he might be half-expecting a visit from someone in the troupe . He knew that we would be wondering why Penny had not returned , and mere strolling players though we were , fly-by-night people , still we might dare to bother him about it . No doubt he would be ready for such a timid call , and perhaps that very readiness , in which he would take such pleasure , would help shield me . In his mansion on Avonbank , he usually dined with his wife about four , after which he went to his pleasures . I decided to call at five , when he should be in good spirits , and his mind that I so feared perhaps not so alert as before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also I dressed with greater care than for any role I had ever taken on the stage . My aim was to present to him his favorite conception of a strolling player , the kind from which it was patently absurd to expect any trouble over a mishap to a fellow trouper  --  lowborn , vain , greedy for the good things his purse would not buy , weak , dishonest , and dirty- minded . All of these things I was , in some degree  --  certainly enough so that I could play the part well . I put on a dirty shirt and frayed and soiled my best coat . The latter I could clean and mend , with little trouble . My neck was begrimed and my fingernails black ; but my stock was new and gaudy and I reeked of cheap perfume . These preparations would seem to show high cunning . Actually they were elementalin this pursuit , the simplest arithmetic of the mere approach to the problem . I had always been fairly foxy , but only a desperate , inspired , and supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Anthony 's door tried me far . It was something like taking a first cue before a hostile audience , monstrously magnified . Truly the anxiety an actor feels for the success of his part is more intense than the audience realizes . But perhaps there was another , far deeper and more strange reason for the analogy . I think that the whole enterprise had shaped itself in my mind as a play rather than real life . Instead of Dick Fingers employing stagecraft for an off-stage affair , I seemed to be Dick Drury using gutter lore for my last and greatest role as a trouper . Threatened only by popguns and a cardboard gallows , the footlight hero may be fearless , cool , and resourceful . I would be a great actor soon , the gypsy woman had told me . But she had looked in my hand , her body had twisted as though in a cramp , and she had refused to tell me any more . I gave a bold rap with the knocker , then a timid one . Quite possibly it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a servant answered the bell , my pretensions were so apparent that they did not anger him : he could truly feel superior to me , not merely desire to , hence was good-naturedly contemptuous of me , not compelled to be insolent toward me . Yet he was a slave , I a freeman . There was no doubt whatever of his status : black or white cargo was Sir Anthony 's love  --  anyway , I could look into the man 's eyes and see the chains on his soul . The answer was , that willing slaves may obtain an immense conceit , a counterfeitp191but self-sustaining dignity , by immersing themselves in their masters . Truly to enslave a fellow human is an equal crime to killing him , because it destroys his uniqueness that is his prime gift from God . It puts an end to the brief miracle of his distinct identity . This doorman gloried in Sir Anthony 's glory , triumphed in his every victory , tingled at his lusts . " What do ye want ? " he asked . " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too busy . " " He 's pretty busy . Did he send for you ? " It was deductible that he often sent for men who looked like me . " No , he did n't , but if he 'll give me a minute  --  " " Well , tell me who ye are , and what ye want , and I 'll ask him . " " I 'm Dick Drury , who used to be with Purdy 's Players and Revelers  --  they 're actors . I wanted to ask him about a girl in the Company that he took a kind interest in . " " Wait outside , and I 'll let ye know . " I had not liked to reveal my identity to this servant , but it had been necessary , first , to gain entrance to the mansion , second , as an initial move to gain Sir Anthony 's confidence . The man was gone for three or four minutes , I should judge . Perhaps his master had been busy ; possibly he was being questioned closely about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a contemptuous gesture . " Sir Anthony says he 'll give ye a minute , " he informed me cheerfully . " Come this way . " He saw me take uneasy glances at the house 's grandeur . He did not see the glance , at once sharp and comprehensive  --  preternaturallyso , I believe , so excited were my powers  --  that I gave a tall , young woman who crossed the room ahead of me into a curtained doorway . I did not doubt this was Lady Beach . When he had obtained her , she was no doubt his greatest prize , surpassingan argosy of slaves black and white ; if his exultation had since worn off , the trophy was still worth hanging in his hall . The victory had been won eight years before , according to care- fully compiled records . She had been eighteen then , he about twice her age . Her name was Alice and she belonged to an ancient , noble , but impoverished Cornish house . She had been a great beauty and was greatly beautiful yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how she kept her carnal beauty alive . I did not think God had helped her do it , his concern being more for the spirit , which has its own kind of beauty , but not this kind . Perhaps God 's great Adversary had stepped in . I hoped that she had not seen my face . The butler led me into a small library , where an open fire clucked and murmured happily , and grave books in manycoloredleathers lined the walls . In a big chair , smoking a clay pipe , sat Sir Anthony Beach . He glanced up at me with what I might have sworn was friendly interest in his large , handsome , wide-apart gray eyes . He was an extraordinarily handsome man . I stooped to him , then stood ill at ease . " What can I do for you ? " he asked in his rich , low voice , his baby mouth not smiling yet good-natured . Then , before I could untie my tongue : " Why , by God , I believe I remember you ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said , greatly gratified , and glancing about to see if the servant were in hearing of the compliment . No action could have been more effective in establishing my role and laying any suspicions he might feel . It was the finest fruit of my gutter education and my schooling on the stage , and there was lightning playing in my mind . " My man said your name was Drury , " he went on . " I did n't remember it , but remember your face well . You had breakfast with me at  --  Brighton  --  less than a fortnight ago  --  one of that excellentcompany of actors . " " Your honor did n't miss it ! " " It 's a pleasure to see you again , although I 'm sorry that the plan for the Company did n't go through . " " I know you did the best for us you could . "  | " Thank you . It was a pity that Mr. Chichester had made other arrangements . " He paused , his face lighting . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sent for your company after all , and that 's what brings you to Bristol ? " He had no need of such big guns , such a Toledo blade . He was practically certain he had nothing to fear from me . Yet he was treating me as though a mortally dangerous adversary . That was his way  --  that made him an even more dangerous adversary than I had worst feared . " No , sir , I 'm sorry to say  --  " " Perhaps it 's better so . Bristol is my home city  --  I 'm very partial to it  --  but it is n't London , where I 'm sure your company is fated to make a notable success . How is that lovely young actress , Miss  --  Price ? " My heart beat softly , slowly , coldly . " Why , Sir Anthony , it 's her I want to ask you about , " I said . He looked puzzled . " I do n't quite understand . Perhaps you mean you want some kind of recommendation  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We got your letter , but Penny never did come back . " " That 's strange . " " I do n't want to bother you about it , but we were all puzzled , and when I quit the Company and came to Bristol , I thought I 'd ask you if you know where she went , and maybe she and me could get together on some kind of turn . " " I have n't the slightest notion where she went . Naturally I suppose she rejoined the Company . Were you worried about her ? " " Well , not ' zactly worried . Players come and go , you know  --  we thought she might have struck out for London . Master Purdy missed her plenty . She was his star , when you come down to it  --  even though she and me took many a bow together ! I missed her too , I 'll be frank with your honor  --  she and I were fair thick  --  and I wondered why I did n't get no letter from her . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had learnedP194them beforehand . " Of course actors are n't much for writing letters , and us traveling around so much  --  " " The last time I saw her , she mentioned an ambition to play in London . I ca n't remember her saying that she was going there  --  " Sir Anthony paused to reflect , with a great gentleman 's respect for his own word . " No , I 'm sure she did n't ! I got the distinct impression she was returning to the Company . " " Well , I reckon that settles it . She 's either gone to London , or else she met some cove she took to , and went off with him . " " That 's a pity . She was certainly your female star . " " One reason I quit the Company , was we did n't do so well after she left . " " Let me recall the whole matter . She arrived on Friday , I believe and I had dinner with her that night at the Cabot Arms . At that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she game me the impression I mentioned . On Saturday morning I sent her a note that the plan had failed  --  to tell the truth , I could hardly bear to bring the bad news in person  --  and said I would call for her late Saturday , for supper . When I arrived at the inn , the host told me that she had gone without leaving any forwarding address . Of course I supposed she had rejoined the Company . " " Well , she did n't , but I thank your honor , for the time you gave me . " " You 're perfectly welcome . Do you think you 'll go to Londonto look for her ? " " No , sir . If she did n't think enough of me to let me know where she went , she can go  --  hang herself . " I seemed to have had a coarser expression on my tongue , but had checked it on account of the company I was in . Sir Anthony was a man of steel , although the adamant metal was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even so , he could not keep from letting go a faint sigh . How glad he was I had visited him ! His last worry was removed . He was in wonderful spirits now , exultant at his super-P195human cunning and unfailing luck . A little , pretty man , perhaps , but kingly . No one yet had any notion of his real powers ! He was trimmed to sail again for the mouth of the Niger . " That 's a pity , " he said , " if you 're attached to her . " " There 's prettier fish in the sea , though I will say , if you 'll pardon me , she was pretty as a picture , and that ai n't all . " I gave him a suggestion of a wink . He did not take offense at the familiarity . Instead he leaned forward , very slightly . My heart raced , as I lowered the stinking bait into his deep , slime-bottomed pool . " A nice figure too , I recall , " he murmured . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that 's a fact . But I seen some right here in Bristol to match or beat it . " " I dare say you have . You 're thrown with many young girls that move in a different world from mine . " " I reckon that 's true , your honor , but some of ' em would surely like to come up and look around . Why , they 've never seen a room like this . " " I dare say . " " Even the real young'ns  --  in these days you 'd be surprised how forward they are . " " Is that so ? " He lighted his pipe that had gone out . " What did you tell me your name was ? " " Dick Drury . " " You seem an alert , open-eyed , sensible fellow , and I 'm interested in your observations . How young do you mean ? " " Why , some of ' em bare thirteen . " " Do any start that young ? " " They would , if they was handled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're old enough , they 're big enough , and when they 're big enough , they 're old enough . " I stopped , abashed . " I should n't be taking your honor 's time  --  " " Do n't worry about that . I 'm interested in other circles than mine  --  to be frank , sometimes I get a little weary of my own surroundings . "   " Why , I could show you  --  " " What were you going to say ? " " If you 'll forgive my boldness , I was going to say if you was interested in looking at some of them real young fillies , I could bring you some that would take the eye of any lord . I do n't mean anything by it , but some of ' em have just started out , and some not even that . " " I suppose an actor , like you , has the inside track . " " Well , sir , we learn a lot , traveling about the country . I do n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for a gentleman . I mean the daughters of yeomen , and shopkeepers , and the like : why , you 'd think they was lady born to look at some of ' em , when they 're real young . They 're more eager to try their wings than a gentleman like you would ever guess . " " Why , I 'd like to look over one or two , just for the novelty of it . " His expression had changed : he was no longer handsome , and his pretty mouth made me think of a pink worm . I saw him as I think Penny might have seen him , on Friday night after a delicious supper at the Cabot Arms . His pretty dimples in cheeks and chin revolted me . " If you say so , I 'd like to handle it for you  --  provided  --  " " If I want anything , I pay well for it . " " I did n't mean that , your honor . I know you 'll reward me if I serve you well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . They might make a charge against me for kidnaping , if she was a virgin , and anyhow her father and brothers might fair kill me . It could be done safe as winking , though . " " What precautions should be taken  --  to avoid trouble of any kind ? " " Not for the girls or anyone to know my name or yours either . You 'd meet ' em in a quiet , safe place , but bring plenty of wine or brandy , or maybe some trinkets for them . ' T would be best that your own cupmates and servants not know it , ' cept your doorkeeper . I mean , if some of the riffraff I know e'enP197suspected a gentleman of your kidney had any dealings with me , they 'd watch me like a hawk to get in on the game , and that would spoil everything . " It was a dangerous speech . I had prepared it with great care , but had expected to have to postpone it for another , safer meeting . I was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely nodded thoughtfully . " I wo n't come to , this house again , " I went on furtively . " If I 've got word for your honor , I 'll hunt you up at whatever tavern you 're at , and wait outside for you . " I had risen now , but still he did not respond . Why had I not played safer , devil take me  --  merely presented a knavish fellow whom it might occur to him that he could use , let him only smell the bait and not dangle it before him ? I had sworn to take all the time that the game required . If I was a Greek when it came to cunning , he was a Levantine . He had foxed his mother for extra turns at her teats ; he had trained and purified his art by dealing with crafty Arab slave merchants ; he had outtrickedtreacherous and unpredictable seas ; he had gained riches and power by matching wits with the sharpest in the land and coming off best . I had only one chance against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was one that he could not readily ascribe to a fly-by-night actor . Rallying swiftly , I could not believe that he had the least inkling of the truth . Surely he had taken for granted that my game was the usual one  --  for money  --  and was merely waiting for me to try to milk him . I spoke in a flustered tone : " I do n't ask you to advance me any money , your honor . I wo n't say I could do better to flash some on the girls , because it would only scare ' em : if they had it in their minds to be whores , you would n't want them . But if you 're satisfied with my service , you can pay me what you think it 's worth . " " That 's fair enough , " he answered . " You wo n't have any complaint , if you furnish me an entertaining evening . But here's ten shillings now , as an earnest of your wage . " He handed me two crowns . " Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend it in making the arrangements . There 's plenty more where it came from . " " I 'll get at it right away , sir , if you say so . " " I do n't see why not . I 'm not especially busy this coming week , and of a mind to enjoy a novel experience . " " Then your honor will hear from me soon . " It seemed to me that passers-by would hold their noses , I stank so . It was not because I had been in Sir Anthony 's presence . He smelled dangerous , not foul . In fact he seemed to emit a faint perfume , such a perfect flower of his strange kind had he grown to be . Rather the stench was on my own hands . I despised myself for employing the bait I did . Instead of poetic justice , the fact that I was playing on the appetite that had destroyed Penny made it an unforgivable offense to my spirit . More , I was not in the least shocked or appalled by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps the bait itself was the only one I had , certainly the best for this fish ; but I was so wonderfully handy with it ! Like a skilled , enthusiastic angler , I was able to dangle it before him with a wonderfully lifelike motion ! It came to me that I would make a good pimp . The potentialities of pimping were within me , along with the rest of the character presented to him . Under different circumstancesI would have had a fine stable of girls , young and tender and lovely ones for the rich , older , harder , and drier but good workers for the common customer , hags for the poor , and even a virgin now and then , obtained at great expense and risk , for the Sir Anthony Beaches . Worn out soon myself , I would come to take a vicarious pleasure in a good patron 's sport . P199As I came by Horse Fair  --  for I had nothing to do the rest of the night but wait and walk  --  an aging bawd gave me a timid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too cheap for me , she was thinking  --  or rather feeling , for any thought had always taxed her , and of late she had let it slide . I was too young for her too , she felt  --  too sober , too particular . But when I smiled at her , she stopped with her dim lamps lighting up . She appeared to grow taller , there was an illusion of color in her face , she gave a horrid re-enactment of flirtatious posturing that had once served her well . She was not really old , her heart cried . Anyway there were some , even young men who preferred a woman who knew what she was about . " Good evening to ' ee , sweetheart , " she said . " What do you charge , ma'am ? " I asked , my heart burning . " How much do I charge , ' ee ask ? " She had not expected the question so soon , and it was a very difficult one . If she asked too little or too much she might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would have faced Shylock , if he must take his pound of flesh to a hair 's weight . " Why , honeycomb , I a' n't got siller on the brain like them saucy , high-stepping ' ores . ' Ee come wi ' me , and we 'll ha ' no trouble about the wage . " " How about ten shillings ? " I asked . " What say ' ee ? " " How about ten shillings ? " It was as though I had dealt her a mortal wound . " Why do ' ee mock me ? " she whispered , unable to lift her voice . " What ha ' I done to ' ee , that ' ee 'd treat me so ? " " I 'm not mocking you , before God ! Here  --  here 's ten shillings ! Look at ' ern ! Two crowns ! I put ' em in your hand ! They 're dirty money , but you 'll wash them white as snow . " I hastened on in great pain . In a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage , the properties , and the business was concerned . What I was not ready for was a possible last-minute reluctance of the fish to take the bait . He had been eager before , but talking about an adventureis one thing  --  the eyes brighten and the heart expands  --  undertaking it is quite another . As it becomes imminent , its difficultiesand dangers disguise themselves in the mind as a coldness toward it . Spitting on the worm might give it luck , but I must not trust the jade . I was dealing with a slave catcher . His only weakness in the trade had been his propensity to overload his ship with the chained cargo . In spite of his cruel nature , he had a strangely voluptuous imagination  --  diseased , perhaps , by that very cruelty . But I too had lain awake in the midnight hours , breathless with lascivious imaginings . I had dreamed dreams that I would never tell a living soul . I had called on Sir Anthony Beach on a Wednesday evening . On the following Friday evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his favorite taverns ; and walking through the taproom , caught his eye . Presently he came out into the courtyard , from where I led him into a forsaken alley . The sun had not yet set , but it was twilight behind these walls . " Well , Dick ? " he began impatiently . " Your honor , I talked to the girls I had in mind , and they was eager for a good time as a couple of cuckoos . " " Why two of them ? What do I want of two ? " No doubt he suspected that I intended to keep one for myself  --  to make a merry party of four  --  a familiarity he would not dream of permitting . " Why , your honor , I thought you 'd take your pick and send the other home  --  or if you took the fancy , keep both of ' em . " " Well , I might as well look them both over , " he remarked , appeased . " But you 'll have trouble choosing between ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all offensive in a lickspittle . It was offensive enough to myself . " Because both are so comely ? "   " They 're that too , I warrant , but it 's not what I meant . They 're twins . " " What say you ? " " Like two peas in a pod . Their own mother can hardly tell ' em apart . And they 're thicker than any thieves . I mean , what one does , the other wants to do it too , and you 'll have a hard time taking one and making the other go home , I tell you . " Evil had stood very close to me more than once , but never arm in arm , hand in hand , lip to lip as in this wretched alley in the grimy-looking dusk , mouthing obscenity to the pretty , silverhairedknight . Truly I believe that my soul stood in greater danger at that moment than in any in my life . But I had hooked my fish . " How old are they ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourteen . I 'd put ' em down as not quite . But they 're old enough , you can believe me . " " Comely , you say ? " " As pretty as two peaches on a branch . " " Have they had much experience ? " " Why , your honor , I thought I told you . They 've not had any . They 're the daughters of a widow woman , a milliner she is , and one reason they 're so eager to get out , she 's held ' em in such tight rein . " " Where did you plan for me to meet them ? " " It 's just a cottage , your honor , on the edge of the town on the Bath road . They know the place  --  their cousins live there , save they 've gone to Plymouth  --  and they were afraid to go to a finer place . But it 's clean and handy and quiet . " " How much money should I take , do you suppose ? " He spoke eagerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no commonquestion . On its answer would depend whether or not he threw the hook . " Why , sir , you do n't need none . If you 'd offer Doris any  --  or Dorothy either , although Dorothy 's a might bolder than her sister  --  I think they 'd take fright , thinking you deemed ' em doxies . They 're going for the fun , and the taste of high life , for I told ' em you was a fine gentleman like they never got smell of before . You can send ' em some trinkets later , if you 're pleased with them . There 's no danger of you being robbed , for nobody but us knows about it , still it would worry me if you have more than a few shillings . If you 're satisfied with the sport , why , the next day you can  --  " I stopped , abashed . " If I 'm satisfied , I 'll pay you two guineas  --  later . " His voice glowed . " Will you , your honor ! Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my best . " " When do you want to go ? " " Why , sir , that 's for you to say ! Them twin squabs can hardly wait . " " I 'm occupied most of the week . Can you arrange it for tonight ? " " Well , it 's pretty short notice  --  but I reckon I can . " It was almost incredible that the words should sound so clear and casual out of the knot of my throat . I had hoped he would say tonight , yet the sudden striking of the hour chilled my bone 's marrow . " Say ten o'clock ? " " If I can get hold of ' em at all tonight , that 's time enough , and if I ca n't , why , I 'll report to your honor . " " What about equipage ? I can take my carriage  --  " " Why , half the people on the road would know it ! I 'll hire a hackney  --  ' twill cost only a couple of shilling  --  and pick you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stop in the road in front of the door . I 'll look for you at ten . " He turned on his heel and entered the taproom . What he said to any cupmate in the next little while could easily determine whether I would live out the waning of this moon . I repaired to the Capstan Rest and ordered a Hollands . As far as I could tell , the tapster did not give me a second glance , although at onceP203disappeared in an inner room . The white-fire liquor did well by me , at this cold time . It was going to be colder soon . The march of events was quickening already : as I puzzled over the best way to get word to Billy Clews that tonight would be the night , the beggar-king himself appeared from the dim rear . He was a man of wellcontrolled , no telltale countenance , yet I knew by his eyes that something of great moment had happened . " I 'm glad you came , Jerry , " he told me : " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So ? " " That same fellow  --  Dick  --  is back there . He 's found out something you ought to know . " " I have n't much time , but  --  " I did not know why I said that . It was hardly seven ; I need not even go to dress for an hour and a half . " It 'll take only a minute , and you may find it important . Go back and talk to him . " So I entered the same tubby we had met in before . A candle was already burning on the table ; a bottle of good gin and two glasses twinkled a little . If the man called Dick was expecting me , he still appeared startled , perhaps a little gray and shaken , but even that gave him more individuality than usual . He glanced behind me for sight of Billy , and when I shut the door confining the two of us together and alone , he leaned far back from the table . " Where 's Billy ? " he muttered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news for me . " " Billy 'll tell ye . " " No , he said you 'd tell me . " I sat down opposite him . " Ye better call him . He 'll kind o ' remind me like , if I r forget anything . " " No , you 'll remember it all right . " " Pour yourself a drink . I 'll pour one for ye . ' T is Billy 's bottle , but we 're all friends . "   " Good friends . But I 'll not take drink now . Go ahead with what you know , and I 'll pay you ten shillings . " " I do n't want no silver , honest . I just do n't want  --  " " Yes ? " " Ye told me to keep on looking , and I did . Ye wo n't be ' raged wi ' me , when I only did what ye told me . " " No , I wo n't hurt you . Just speak up . Is the girl dead ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't in Bristol . " " Where is she ? " " I do n't rightly know , but she 's gone . " " Tell me from first to last . Speak calmly . " " Ye know the last we heard o ' her , she 'd gone to that ' pothecaryshop . ' T was on Monday afternoon . " " That 's right . " " Well , I found a wharf-rat who seen her Monday night . He said she had a bandage on her face , and that same little cap , but he ' lowed at first maybe the bandage was just a cloth , so if some girls was walking the dock they would n't know who she was . " " What do you mean ? " " She was getting in a rowboat wi ' two sailors , and he thought at first she was going out to one o ' the ships for a lark . But when she spoke to him , he took it maybe he was wrong . " " What did she say ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and went on in a hoarse whisper . " She said that if anyone come looking for her , to tell him not to no more . " " What ? " " Never try to look for her no more  --  not any more . She did n't want nobody to look for her  --  or to look at her . She said to tell ye she was going away , and to let her go in peace . " " Is that all she said ? " I spoke in calm tones , not to excite him , I thought . " She said to tell ye that she loved ye mighty heaps , or something like that , and to ' member how ye played together , in Sou'hampton Town . "   " I see . I mean  --  I will . " " Aye , so she said . " He breathed hard a little while , and then asked , " Can I go now ? " " Wait . Are you sure that 's all she said ? " " That 's all she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell someone before now ? " " He was worried about it in his mind , he was . He said it o'er to himself , and it sounded mighty queer-like , not like a ' ore going out for a lark on one o ' the ships , and he ' lowed he 'd better not get mixed up in it no way . But I knowed he knew something , from talking to him before , so I got some grog down him , and he came out with it . " It was quite natural for Dick to go to that trouble , although not for my sake or for money 's . Having little identity of his own , he was compelled to dwell on other identities , to find out things about them , no matter how dangerous . It was quite natural too that the wharf-rat would confide in him . It would be like talking to himself . " Do you think anyone forced her to go ? " I asked . " No , Mr. Jerry , I do n't . Ye see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the wharf-rat heard . " " Well ? " " They was frighted , maybe afeared she was a lady after all , and they 'd pay high for fetching her to their ship , or where'er she was going . Please take me out , ' she told ' em . I 'll gi ' ye all the pennies what I got left . And nobody in Bristol 'll know where I 've gone . ' And then the three o ' ' em got in the boat and ' t was the last he saw o " em . " A long silence fell . Dick appeared to huddle in his chair , his face very pale . I looked at the beam over our heads , but could do nothing about it . " What ships were in the harbor ? " I asked . " There was a drove o " em , but the Vega 'd be the one she 'd take . Her was sailing on the tide , just before dawn , for the Americas , and the others not for some days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailors  --  they had ' costed her most like , or she had stopped and asked ' em . Their boat was heading toward the Vega , when the wharf-rat seen ' em last . " " Do you know when the Vega will return to Bristol ? " " I thought ye 'd want to know that . The shortest would be two years . " Is that all ? " " Ary word . " " Here 's your ten shillings . " Dick had said he wanted no silver , but he took it anyway with a trembling , gray hand . In spite of his lack of individuality , he had all the members of a man . " Now I got to be going  --  " " That 's all right . I wo n't need you any more . But perhaps Billy will want to see you later  --  before ten o'clock . And please tell him to step in here . " It was a long time yet till ten o'clock . The telling of the news had taken only a few minutes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door that had just closed opened again to admit Billy Clews . He sat down , poured some straight gin in a glass , and gave it to me . I drank it and thanked him . I could not bear to look at him straight as yet , but if I did , there would have been nothing to see on his face . He was not looking at me , either . Our eyes strayed around the room , careful not to intercept each other . " Well , you 'd better say something , Jerry , " he remarked at last , when he had downed his own drink . " What is there to say ? " " Well , for one thing , you 've found out all you need to know around here . " " She knew I 'd come to look for her . " " Yes , and you might have known you would n't find her . " " Maybe I 'll find her yet . " " Figs may grow on thorn , " he told me quietly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @   " Why , I suppose so . " " There was deep water ' twixt the dock and the anchorage . She could ' ve slipped overside , if she pleased . If she got aboard , the journey 's long , and she 's got no money to pay her passage , and the work required of her wo n't be to her liking . Do you think she 'll touch port ? " " Why , she may . " " If you do find her , ever , it will be an accident . I 'll guarantee that . Because you wo n't look for her , Jerry  --  not one so high and proud as her . Keep your eyes open in every crowd , if it comforts you . Then if you run into her , it 's fate 's fault , not yours . " " You 're right about that . " " Build a little house for her in your soul , where she can live and you can love her world without end unchanged . For the rest , be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit him hard , I thought , that he could talk so . Still , after all , he was a king in his way . " I 'll do what I can and bless you all my days , " I told him after a long pause . Then I wished I need not say anything more , but unless I did so , he might think I had not dealt fairly with him , a dangerous thing . " What time is it ? " I asked . " It just clipped half past seven . There 's a clock on the wall behind you . " " Well , you 'd better get Dick and any others you think best , and be able to prove where you are at ten o'clock tonight . " That did not open his eyes that I could notice , but their muscles must have drawn a little in spite of him , for they looked strange . " So soon ? " he asked calmly . " It was already arranged . " " You 're going ahead just the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face faded out , and I could see  | nothing but his gleaming eyes . " No , it wo n't be the same , " I told him after a second 's thought . This had just occurred to me . He poured himself a drink . His hand was completely steady , but the muscles on the back stood out . " I take it , the whole thing 's become a lot simpler , " he said thoughtfully . " A great deal , " I answered . " You might say  --  your hands are no longer tied . " " That 's true . " " It 's nothing to me , you understand . It 's just you and the girl and him . But I 'm glad you told me when it was coming off . If it 's found out I helped you look for her , I 'll be glad to be able to prove I was right here in the Capstan Rest the whole night . I 'll have Dick here too , and any others who 've ever had anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know why I sent for ' em . We 'll invite a constable to have an all-night bout with us . " " Dick will know why . " " He 'll not peach you , Jerry . That 's a fact . He 'd not do it for fifty guineas . He do n't play both ends against the middle . No one would ever let him spy for them any more . And that 's a mild way to put it . " " Thanks . There 's just one more thing . " The clock behind me said it was not yet eight . " If the wrong man is arrested and going to be stretched , 1 ' 11 confess . " " That 's gentlemanly of you , " Billy replied slowly , " but I doubt if it 's rational , if the man 's a bad'n . " He scratched his head , caught and killed a louse while he was about it , and continued in a low , calm , thoughtful tone : " One of the risks of our professionis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law allows for it  --  not in theory , of course , but in practice . You see , Jerry , the crown demands punishment for every crime , preferably the doer , otherwise someone whose neck fits a noose . Mind you , if I was going to swing in your place , I 'd peach you of course . If I was going to swing for some unknown person , I 'd still harborp209hard feelings . You know how a husband may bed down with a score or more women , but if just once his wife accuses him when he did n't do it , why , he 's fit to be tied . I 'd have no real right to complain . The other boys would figure I 'd challenged fate  --  of course they would n't use those fancy words  --  and had got my due . " For the first time I perceived that Billy Clews was under great strain . His sedate philosophizing was intended to cover it up  --  actually it had the fine logic and high honesty of a tosspot approaching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause . Unless he were personally involved , I would not have expected him to become excited about any crime , even another gunpowder plot against his rival , the king of England . He had disclaimed Penny and me and all our affairs . " Granted your point is well-taken , " I remarked like a professorat Oxford , " I 'd still confess . " " Which persuades me , in spite of your trying to save your neck in this business , that you 're a gentleman . " " What has trying to save my neck to do with it ? What you mean is , I 'm passing up a chance to be a martyr . Any gentleman would , I assure you , if he could . Only one of the crowd would want the sympathy and admiration of the crowd in such a personalaffair . As you say  --  there 's just Penny  --  and he  --  and I. " Do you mind , little girl , if I talk so wise ? I too am under great strain . I too must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him know how lonely and cold I am . I am no king , to consider calmly in my closet the fall of a great head ; I am not even a beggar-king like Billy Clews . We are both putting on a show that would interest you , if you were here and some other had gone in your place . Our audience is ourselves . I entreat you to trust me : I will do the best I can . I am not a gentleman yet , and unless you stay by me , in sickness and health , I never will be , and then my best monument to you will never rise . Perhaps this difficult exercise of my stunned mind is cooling and schooling me for the task ahead . If it only amountsp2I0 to showing off for Billy , it is because I need bitterly the courage invoked by his admiration . It is all for you . In this hour I have acknowledged our evermore parting . Think , if in life or death your imagination yet lives , what that means ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you again in this world I will count it as great a miracle as if I see you in heaven . I will not look for you , for that would betray all you gave me , and I will not look for miracles , for they fall like the gentle rain on the place beneath . Still I must not break in the least in sight of this man . Unless he finds me strong , he will interfere with my venture even now , so I must talk in this lofty , imperturbableway . Only when you and I are alone , I entering the little room where you live and I can love you world without end , will I show you my heart . " Well , " said Billy Clews dreamily , " I 've had gentlemanly instincts myself , sometimes . For instance , I did n't strangle the bitch who peached me  --  just because she 'd given me the best tupping I ever got . " " That was splendid . And I wish we could talk longer , but it 's eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine French brandy out of a cabinet , and filled two small crystal glasses . We picked them up , looked at each other , and touched them . But the sardonic toast that was ready on his tongue , that his keen mind had composed for my admiration and his own , did not come forth . Instead his sallow face went white , his eyes went small and intensely bright , and he said in a low , rumbling tone and with white heat : " May a million devils burn his pretty face forevermore ! " Wearing my best clothes , I hired a hackney from a liverymanwith whom I had already established credit . Leaving it at a hitching rack a good distance from the inn , I put on work clothes . P211At ten o'clock I drew up in front of Sir Anthony 's mansion . I had no weapon but my hands . Presently a side door opened to emit a cloaked figure , moving swiftly and lightly as a moth to a flame . In his hand was a basket not often seen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glasses and perhaps things for a midnight supper , for girls of fourteen and under are yet occupied with their bellies . He did not bring the mead that he had once promised Penny . I had brought that , turned bitter in the cup , for him to drink . He made straight for the hackney , and I thought that nothing could stop him now . My heart failed when the front door opened , and a tall woman emerged and intercepted him at the coach door . Her hair looked raven-black in the moonlight and her skin was passing fair . Once she had been both beautiful and noble . She was beautiful yet , but perhaps she had traded her nobility for the unnatural keeping of the other gift , a bargain made in hell . " What is it , Alice ? " Sir Anthony asked gravely . " I thought you said , when you came home early , that you were sickly and going to bed , " she answered in a full-throated voice that reminded me of Penny . " What if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I decided to go out . " " Out of your mind ? " There was a look of mocking laughter on her white face , but she spoke gravely . " What do you mean by that ? " " I think you 're a very sick man , Tony ; you do not know how sick . Such sickness often leads to madness . " " Stop that nonsense and go into the house . " She looked calmly at him , and then , with a slight sharpeningof her gaze , at me . " Good night , " she said , with her head a littlelifted and her lips curled . Gracefully she turned and withdrew . Sir Anthony entered the hackney . I clucked at the horseswith great good humor . When there was no sound other than the212 THE UPSTART THE CURTAIN 213P212clatter of hoofs on the cobblestones and the turning wheels , I was desperately afraid of what he was thinking , dreadfully waiting to hear him order me to turn back . It drove me to a stroke of cunning so far beyond my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Below . " Why , I think your lady remembered me , " I said , in a tone of satisfaction . " I did n't know you 'd ever spoken to her . " " No , sir , I did n't have the honor , but she took a good look at me as I was going to your honor 's parlor , and I could see she knew ' t was the same cove come again . " " That means you 'll have to take especially good care of me , does n't it , Dick ? " His girl 's mouth curled prettily : I could see it in the moonlight . A true word spoken in jest , he thought . " I do n't ken you , your honor . " " Suppose roadknights found me and tried to kill me . I 've very little money on me , but they would n't know that . Well , you 'd have to fight for my life as hard as for your own . My lady would tell the constables that I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a doorman before , so you 'd be easily traced  --  and they 'd never believe it was n't a put-up job . " " Yes , sir , that 's true . I 'd be the first to swing . But if you did n't tell anybody you was going with me , no roadknights will hear of it , and there 's no danger . " " I told only one close friend  --  a high-placed gentleman who is always loyal to me . " Although he did not appear to be lookingstraight at me , I felt as observable in the pallid moonlight as when alone on a brilliant stage . " Oh , that 's no harm , your honor . " " No , I reckon we do n't have to worry , " Sir Anthony remarkedblandly , taking his ease in the seat . I did not take my ease . It seemed to me fairly likely that he had told someone about the venture  --  not a friend , perhaps , since I did not see how his slimy heart could harbor friendship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lecher whose envy heP213desired . I had counted on the cold secrecy of his nature and perhaps in vain ; however , his cunning would cause him to tell me so , whether true or not . Possibly too Lady Beach had looked me over from behind a curtain on my previous visit , and had recognizedme tonight . In any case she had observed me closely tonight , and had no doubt noticed the equipage , since her lordly husband did not often condescend to such plain livery . Certainly she should be able to help the king 's men a good deal , when they inquired as to the fate of Sir Anthony Beach . They would so inquire . That was as certain now as any man-made event of the future could possibly be . It would be like the star 's fading , or tomorrow 's sun . I would not turn back : Penny , in earth or heaven , knew it full well . If Sir Anthony should take warning this moment and seek to escape , he would be too late . He was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know how sick he was  --  but whatever she had meant by that , she slid not know either how sick he was . Such sickness often led to madness , she had told him . It might befall , even as she said . As for me , I was too sane . I could no longer regard the night 's business as a play , or me as an actor in a heroic role . There were no longer any footlights , only the young moon , very bright and beautiful , gleaming through the trees , and the farawaystars . Doris and Dorothy , the milliner 's forward daughters , were stage figments only , existing in the obscene imagination of Sir Anthony and me , but he and I were flesh and blood , in a fleshy and bloody affair . The horses needed clucking at , and an occasional touch of the whip . The left rear wheel needed greasing : it did not squeak yet , but it whined . A black gelding and a brown mare  --  I had nothing better to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse than a man could expect to hire cheap . When with flint-andtinderSir Anthony lighted his clay pipe , I saw his pretty face , his pretty hair that looked almost blue at the sides ; he did not strike me as a man about to die , he looked fine and vital . The match showed something bright gleaming under the seat and I thought it would be a lucky coin or some certain token ; but it was a worthless piece of tin off something that someone had dropped there . I was becoming greatly frightened . I did not have a heroic hair left in my head . I felt awkward , puny , someone that anyone could see through , a palpable fraud . If Sir Anthony spoke to me now , my teeth would chatter and I could not answer .. . " Do you think the young ladies will be waiting for us ? " he asked . " I would n't wonder but they 'd get there before us , " I answered , with just enough hesitation . " But , your honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of speaking . They 're the daughters of a widow-woman milliner . " You ought to feel as safe with them , Sir Anthony , as with a poor schoolmaster 's girl . " I hope they 're not young sluts , " he told me . " I do n't demandthe blood of the Howards "  --  he was being droll  --  " but I insist that they look and smell like ladies , and not offend me with their speech . " Thank you , thank you , Sir Anthony . You do not know how you have strengthened me . Penny looked and smelled to your liking , and spoke with the speech of Shakespeare , the tongue of Portia . I hate you ! That is the long and short of it . That is all of it , and all there needs to be . I do not regard you as a venomous serpent that I am duty bound to remove from the earth . I have not confused myself with God . I will not deal you poetic retribution . But I hate you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill you . I am not taking the law into my own hands . It will not be the arm of the unwritten law : nothing so high-sounding as that . It will not even be revenge , if the word means a self-righteous thing , a virtuous laying of a claim , as its roots imply . This will be murder . No civilized society on earth would dare deem it otherwise . It will be a crime of passion . If I am caught , I will beP215properly hanged for an unpardonable breach of the law . Commonsense tells me I will probably be hanged , in spite of the strangeness of that picture in my mind , but my hate is so extreme that I 'll take the chance . " Is it much farther ? " Sir Anthony asked . " You might drive a little faster . " Sir Anthony Beach was in a hurry ! It took some more of the terror out of my heart and gave the poison freer play . I had a delicious awareness of cruelty . My mouth 's faint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and very bright , felt good . Sir Anthony did not know that instead of going faster , we should be driving at a slow and stately pace ! We should display no unseemly haste , when a gentleman of his eminence is making such a journey . Even that much respect is shown to a pickpocket caught and in the hangman 's cart . " It 's not far , your honor , " I told him cheerfully , " but we 'll go a little faster . " We were already gaining the outskirts of the city . We threaded through narrow , dirty , crooked streets , and perhaps Sir Anthony was glad of the lanterns of the watch dancing in a nearby lane , and to hear a voice cry " All 's well ! " Did there come a faint knocking on his soul 's door that he would not heed ? The moon showed herself young and fair , but low over the rooftops . Sir Anthony looked at her ; she found favor in his eyes , I thought ; she was the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lucky moon , he believed , her every rising finding him risen further . She would soon set , but I had brought a lantern . You do n't know what you will see by its light , Sir Anthony . We turned into a side road , passed a neglected market garden , then a dark house , then a field broader and drearier than he would expect in Bristol 's environs , finally coming to a cottage under a very old , lone , almost leafless dying winter-apple tree . But it was a Sarah among trees ; its soon decay and fall had not put an end to its fruitfulness . Almost ripe apples hung thick on its indecently bare bows . . . . Half-mad , or else terribly sane and trying to ease my mind of the immediate problem , I thought of Sarah at ninety , with frail , blue-tinted legs , gray scraggly hair , dim eyes , and fallen emaciated breasts , yet having to grow bigbelliedthat God 's word to Abraham might be fulfilled , a horrid thing in mere human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ripened before their time , fallen , and rotted . They gave forth a sweet , sickly smell of death . " It 's not much of a place , your honor , " I blathered to Sir Anthony , " but it 's clean and cozy . " " Where are the girls ? " he asked . " I allow they 've not got here yet . We 're a few minutes ahead of time . " I had got out and was tying the horses to a limb of the apple tree . " When they come , how will you pass the time ? " " Oh , I 'll sit out in the hackney , I reckon , or take a walk . When you want me , just whistle . " My stomach crawling , I was taking a lantern from under the seat . " Wo n't that light be seen ? " His tone was faintly nervous . " Not with the shutters closed . Anyway , there 's thick trees between here and the road . There wo n't be anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unlocking the door . " Where did you get that key ? " " The girls sneaked it to me . Their ma was keeping it , while the people who live here are in Plymouth . They 're cousins of hers . " It was all so plausible , hanging together so well , told so plausibly too  --  I was greatly pleased with it . Actually I had broken in a window and stolen the key from inside the door . Sir Anthony got down , his basket in his hand . But when I threw open the door , he let me enter first , an unusual honor to pay to riffraff . " See if everything 's all right , " he ordered . Everything was all right , I was sure , even to ten feet of rope I had concealed behind a chest . P217Nothing that he did now would make any great difference , I thought . If he tried to run , yelling , I would catch him and break him down and haul him back to the cottage . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned it , without an imperfect detail . I had written it down in my mind with the care of a playwright composing the last act of a melodrama . However , it was not a play : I could no longer harbor any such illusion . It had the horridness and sordidness and dirt of life . " Your honor , will you light the lantern ? " I asked , when he had followed me into the cottage . Placing his basket on the table , he did so . A yellow drop of fire crept across the wick and became a flickering flame that caused the whiteness of his countenance to come and go . As he closed the glass , it burned yellow , and steady like my heart . Sir Anthony looked about him , sniffing . The lantern gave forth an oily smell that mixed with the damp , musty fustiness of the longclosedhouse . " The bedroom 's in there , " I said , pointing to an inner door . " How do you know ? " he asked , faintly smiling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your honor , I walked out yesterday and looked the place over , to see if ' t was fitten for you . " That relieved him somehow ; a little uneasiness that he had denied , or scorned to treat with , faded out . " Are the beds clean ? " It was a lordly gentleman speaking now . " They looked so to me . You can see for yourself . " He went through the inner door , carrying the lantern . In his absence I slipped the key into the lock , turned it , and put it back in my pocket . Its faint rattle would not be audible in the next room ; anyway the windows there were shuttered and any noise of his opening one of them to escape would be entirely audible in this room . Yet when he returned I seemed to perceive a change in his appearance . It was very subtle , but the change within him might be quite otherwise  --  indeed , a very pronounced change , a real revolution . I do not think he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard nothing but the silence of this lonely spot . Standing in the bedroom , looking perhaps to see if the mats were clean , perhaps hoping for some strange reason that they were not , suddenly'he had become conscious of that silence . He had stopped to listen to it . His soul found itself alone . In that solitude , it was suddenly deaf to flattery ; it could see itself small and vulnerable . Everything was not well with it always , it was not the darling of the gods . The mills of the gods grind slowly but they grind exceeding fine . He looked very pretty , in the upthrown lantern light . I felt that he was making himself look pretty somehow : it was one of his defenses when he was in any kind of danger . " I 'm going to wait outside for them , " he told me in casual tones , as he moved toward the door . " Why , there 's no need of you doing that , " I answered . " Why not sit down and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lest I suspect that he was alarmed . He was not really alarmed , he told himself . " This room stinks a bit . I 'll get some fresh air . " He started again for the door . " Wait . " He halted again . " If you take the lantern outside , somebody might see it . " " Then I 'll leave it here , " he told me blandly  --  such a simple solution . He set the lantern on the table . " You 'll just have to get used to the stink again  --  " This time he did not halt his easy , graceful advance until he had turned the knob and the door failed to open . " It seems to be caught , " he said , looking at me over his shoulder . His voice sounded calm . His face appeared calm . An extraordinary man , this  --  a most able , powerful man . " No , your honor , it 's locked . "   " How did it become locked ? " He seemed greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked it . " " Why did you ? " " Well , I might not want anybody breaking in , and disturbingus . " " Give me the key . I want to go outside . " " Why , your honor , I 'd think you did n't like my company . " I spoke jollily . " Take a seat , and compose yourself , and we 'll talk things over . " " Dick , I told you to give me that key . " " Well , I 'm not going to do it  --  just yet . What do you think of that ? " " I do n't know what to think  --  unless you 're drunk . " " I was never soberer in my life . " " Then I 'm afraid you 're being insolent . Cut it out , Dick , before you 've gone too far . " " All right . We 'll talk seriously . " " What do you mean ? " " Sit down , and I 'll tell you . It 's a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Dick , but make it short . " " Oh , we 've got the whole evening before us . No girls arecoming . " " What did you say ? " " There are no such girls . " " What 's the meaning of this ? I do n't like practical jokes . " " It 's no joke , I assure you . " " If you brought me here to rob me , you 've been very foolish . I 'll give you the money I 've got , and not say anything about it to anyone . In fact I ca n't say anything , without revealing this silly girl-chasing ; I 'd be the laughingstock of the city . So I suppose you were n't foolish  --  in fact extremely clever . I did n't give you enough credit before . " " No , you 're the clever one . I 've never in my life seen such a clever , quick-thinking man . "  | " You told me not to bring much money , knowing that would make me feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did bring three guineas . I 'll pay them to you for scoring on me . But I think you could better afford to stay friends with me and go to work for me . I can use such a knowing cove . " " Sit down , please , Sir Anthony . " " Of course . We 'll talk it over . I must confess though  --  you certainly turned a neat trick . " He sat down by the table on which he had placed the lantern and covered basket . His movements remained graceful . " I 'm not interested in your money , " I said . " I 'm interested only in what you did to Miss Price . " Although watching him intently , I could see little change in his countenance that he did not wish me to see . Perhaps the lines from nostrils to lip corners deepened slightly . He intended to look puzzled , and he did . " Why , I did nothing at all to her , that I have n't told you , " he replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraged him . But I thought of Penny getting into the boat with the two unknownsailors  --  a street girl going out to some ship for a debauch and hiding her face from her sisters , the watcher thought  --  and grew steady again . " On second thought , I 'd rather not talk about it , " I answered . " What do you think I did to her , in God 's name ? I tried to help her and failed . Is that any excuse for you to  --  " " You could n't stand her balking you , could you ? An old slave catcher like you . " " What in God 's name do you mean ? " " I thought I could talk to you about it  --  before I killed you for it  --  but I ca n't . " " Why not talk about it ? You 're evidently laboring under a horrible mistake . I 'd like to clear it up . " " No , you made the mistake . She was only a strolling player  --  a schoolmaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but , you see , she was my wife . " " Why did n't you say so at first ? Why  --  " " Do you see that overhead beam ? Under the chest behind you there 's two fathoms of rope . I 'm going to put the rope around your neck , throw the end of it over the beam , and hang you . You 're going to choke , and you 're going to kick , but you 'll stop too soon to suit me . I 'm not telling you to give you time to pray , just time to imagine what it 's going to be like . I want you to picture it as clearly as you can  --  but know it 's going to be a thousand times worse . " While I was speaking , the sweat come out on him full blast . His face had been dry and cool a moment ago ; it might still be cool  --  cold as my heart , in fact  --  but drenched and dripping . He sat very still . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain might be sweating too  --  moving in a puddle of icy sweat . " Are you mad ? " he asked quietly , at last . " Yes , of course . And you 're a very sick man . " " Even if you are mad , you know what would happen to you if anything happens to rne . My wife  --  Lady Beach  --  knows who you are . I 've told half a dozen cronies how you were going to get girls for me  --  tonight at the tavern I told two friends that I was going out with Dick Drury , formerly with Purdy 's Players and Revelers . If you try to run , the king 's men will chase you all over England . You 'll be hanged , and drawn , and quartered . " " Yes , if you did tell anybody that . But I was lying when I said your wife recognized me . She did n't even glance at me when I was at your house before . You know whether you told anyone . If you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be caught . It wo n't be much consolation to you , anyhow , as I 'm hauling you up . " He panted a few seconds ; I waited patiently . " I did tell them , " he cried . " You 'll swing before the town . You think you might kill my wife , and stop her lips  --  "  | " No , I wo n't touch a hair of her head . " " You 're a young man  --  clever  --  with a brilliant future . You do n't want to die . " " I do n't mind much . I do n't hate it as you do  --  worse than hell . And yet you know it 's coming in a few minutes more . " " Would you kill yourself to get revenge for a fancied wrong ? " " It 's not revenge . It 's hate . " " You 've brooded over this , Dick , until you 're out of your mind . Listen . I 'll give you another chance . I 'll forgive all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careless in safeguarding your wife , but I 'll make it up to you a thousand times . " " Do n't talk that silly way , when you 've only a few seconds to live . " " Seconds ! You said minutes ! " " Look around you , man . Breathe the air , your last few mouthfuls . Think of all the money you 've made , and the honors you 've had , and the slaves you 've caught . Feel your heart beating , because it 's soon going to stop . Know you 're alive for a few seconds more , for soon you wo n't know anything . It stinks a little in here , you said , but it 's going to stink worse , and you wo n't smell it . Wipe the sweat off your face . " " You said minutes , " he gasped . " It 's only seconds now . " " Wait . I 'll prove what I can do for you . " His wet , flaccid face became almost handsome again , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed , by this burning hope . " Have you got a pencil ? I 've got one  --  and I 'll tear a page from my notebook . When I 've written the note , you can bind me . Tie me up tight  --  I do n't ask you to trust me  --  " " That 's not what I want of the rope . " I started to rise . " Listen to me , in God 's name . Take the note to my wife . It 'll be in plain English  --  you can read it . It will say for her to give you a package in my cabinet in the library  --  I ' 11 send theP223key with you too . Do you know what 's in that package ? Two hundred guineas in bank notes , and they 're all for you ! " " Give me the key . " He scrabbled for it at his belt and handed it to me . " I may need some money , when this is over , " I told him . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Give me a little more time , " he moaned . " You said it would be minutes . Do n't cheat me ! I 'll tell everything that happened  --  confess every-thing . " I did not speak , did not bother to shake my head . He looked at me and perhaps he saw his sands running out of my hands . I thought that his last hope had died . His eyes fell , he sighed faintly , his taut body went limp . " Then there 's nothing more I can say , " he told me in what seemed utter dispair , " but if you 're a gentleman  --  " " Well ? " I queried when he paused . He could not buy one minute 's reprieve with flattery , it seemed : I was merely interested in these last words . " Have n't you got gentle blood in your veins ? You look like it . What 's your real name ? " Great , wicked Edmund , too , in the greatest of all plays , had been desirous that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was known as Dick Fingers , in London , " I answered politely , as seemed the proper thing for a gentleman , even a little gentleman , when questioned as to his quality and degree . " It was given to me by an old street fiddler who raised me  --  " My audience was not listening . I did not have its attention , a little the same as when latecomers entered a theater , and the yokels watched them take their seats with a fascination they never felt for our stage affairs . A little the same , enough like it to provoke a faint off-center memory of it , but not much like it , really . Sir Anthony 's thoughts were not idle , but flying fast . His only interest in my words was that they gave him a little more time . He was not thinking of death either , but of life  --  how he might keep it yet . His brain was working at terrible intensity . Yet against his strong will I had interrupted him . His outer ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the door of his mind , shaking the walls , in its demand for entrance . His train of desperate thought was as hard to check as an artillery train thundering downhill ; the shock of its arrest seemed to jerk and stiffen his body . His indrawn off-focus eyes moved magnetically to mine . " What did you say ? " he muttered hoarsely , his little throat corded . " Did you say Fiddling Fingers ? " I could not reply . I was looking at his dimpled chin . He broke into a wild laugh , a maniacal sound in that devilriddenroom . " Why , you ca n't kill me , you young fool ! " he howled . " You 're my own flesh and blood ! You 're my son ! " I took refuge in disbelief . It was a hole I dived for , like a hard-chased rabbit . My hair had fluffed up like a rabbit 's running in the wind . It was the cleverest of all tricks , I told myself . Somehow my enemy had found out something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact of the name Fingers and the word fiddler on his laboring mind , still the denouement was too fantastic to accept , like the end of a poor play ; and I had little knowledge and no remembrance of some very great plays , such as Oedipus , whose theme was a malign and inexorable fate . There was only one drama that I knew in which such incredible coincidences occurred , and that was Life . " You 're lying , " I said carefully , when the creature 's laughter had stopped with strangled coughing . His face was ashen and his . whole body shaking . " You know better , " he gasped.  | " Yes , you are . " I was shouting at him now . " A crazy lie , if I ever heard one ! I would n't believe you if  --  " " Wait . " He breathed convulsively a few seconds , then quieted . He remained very pale but was now quite calm . I looked at him with loathing . His nose like mine , and his dimpled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste of nausea was in my mouth . " The facts are perfectly plain , " he went on . " You can judge for yourself . Did n't Fingers have a woman with him named Annie ? " " What of it ? " " Rather tall , hair about the color of yours , greenish-blue eyes , lowborn , with no more feelings than a cow ? She 'd be about fortyfivenow . " " It 's a good description of Bristol Annie . I admit that . " " What relation was she to you ? " " None . I 'm sure of that . " Although Sir Anthony 's smile was faint , his dimples showed . " She was an extremely close relation , if you want to know the truth . " " My mother ? " " Yes . " " That 's another lie . She could n't have been my mother . She called me Mr. Dick sometimes . She never loved me . She never kissed me once . " " I presume she did , when you were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and like a cow she lost interest in you , as soon as you were weaned . So she never told you ? Well , I suppose Fiddling Fingers told her not to . He was a crazy idealist . He must have become fond of you and wanted to give you a chance . " " Lies ! Lies ! To try to save your neck . " " Do n't be a fool , Dick . I do n't expect that of my son . " " I was found in the street , with silken swaddling , with agold ring bearing a crest on a string around my neck . " " What nonsense ! Why do you tell me such an absurd story ? "
