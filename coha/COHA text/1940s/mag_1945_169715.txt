Has the Republican Party a real and immediate future ? <P> Some months ago the question might have been answered with a prompt " no " by many a U.S. voter , Republicans included . One reason : President Truman 's popularity stood at an unprecedented high . <P> But by last week the U.S. political climate had undergone a change . Republicans in Washington were looking up . One G.O.P. Senator , assaying the future of his party , went so far as to crow : " It is n't just that the Truman honeymoon is over ; he 's already in the divorce courts . The way he chastised those House committees in his wage-rise speech is perhaps the worst blunder of its kind since Wilson called those fellows a ' little group of willful men . ' If Truman keeps that up he 'll split the Democratic Party wider than it has ever been . " The Senator , with traditional party optimism , thought that the G.O.P. could win the 1946 elections . <P> On the floor of Congress , Minnesota 's egg-bald Representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , and there can no longer be any doubt that the President proposes to give labor all that they ask for , and perhaps more . ... If he wants to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor and purchase his re-election at the expense of the public , the onus for doing so must rest upon him . . . . " <P> The Nerve Center . This feeling of renewed hope in G.O.P. Washington was based on a hunch that the Truman popularity would continue to drop . The hunch might be wrong . But the hope it kindled had several results . It perked up sagging G.O.P. morale . It whipped Republican Congressmen into a determination to draft a program of their own-and soon-probably before the G.O.P. National Committee meets in Chicago on Dec. 7 . It also started the first hot-stove-league talk of 1948 presidential candidates . <P> So far there were no new names . There was still no substantial talk of top-ranking war heroes like MacArthur , Eisenhower or Marshall . The men now discussed were mostly those who had competed for the nomination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were seen in new lights . It made for good political gossip . <P> Tom Dewey had remained almost clam-silent since his defeat last year , plugging away as governor of New York . This week his hand-picked candidate for mayor of New York ( Judge Jonah J. Goldstein ) was slated for a decisive beating at the polls , which was not likely to enhance Tom Dewey 's political prestige . Governor Dewey also had his own personal hurdle ahead : he must win re-election as governor next year . ( Current gossip had Jim Farley as his Democratic opponent . ) But if Tom Dewey won in 1946 , he could be a strong contender for the 1948 presidential nomination . For one thing , he would have New York 's huge block of delegates in his pocket . <P> Man from Ohio . John Bricker was by no means dead and buried . Ready to run for the Senate next year , he was an almost certain winner unless Ohio 's Governor Lausche , the Democrats ' wonderboy , ran against him . One high-placed Republican who keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a G.O.P. presidential convention were held today , John Bricker would win , hands down .
