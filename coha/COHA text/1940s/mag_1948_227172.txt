Haitians , he had been warned , were too poor to be taxed . There had even been mutterings among the coffee-colored aristocracy about an armed rising . But last week , as President Dumarsais Estim 's income-tax law-the first in Haiti 's 144-year history-went into effect , Haitians were too absorbed by the things Estim was doing with his record-breaking $13,000,000 budget to take much notice of the new tax . <P> Chichi aristocrats and ragged mountain peasants alike chattered excitedly about the model town of Belladre , on the Dominican border . At a cost of some $600,000 , government architects and engineers had transformed it from a cluster of thatched huts , huddled beside a dirt road , into a glistening modern village . To feed it , Estime had cut roads through the fertile mountains around Belladre , organized collective farms , and told the peasants that the government would provide five carreaux ( 16 acres ) of land , with tools and seed , for each family who would work the land . <P> Two other such towns were already being planned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As tourist bait , the government had started building broad avenues and pavilions for next year 's International Exposition at Port-au-Prince , and a new law required businessmen in the . capital 's downtown district to install glass show windows and hang out electric signs . <P> The source of all this energy , jet-black Dumarsais Estim , 48 , was elected two years ago , largely on the strength of his opposition to the dictatorial mulatto President Elie Lescot . The grimly ambitious son of a back-country peasant , Estim gets up each morning at 4:30 , breakfasts on orange juice . Before 5 , he tackles the pile of papers on his desk and with 45 minutes out for lunch and slightly more for dinner , works until midnight . <P> In Port-au-Prince last week , peasants were singing : " Estim , c'est bon papa ; he makes his people step ahead . " The pro-government papers printed flowery poems of praise , in which every pronoun referring to Estim was capitalized . To at least one Haitian , that was carrying things too far .
