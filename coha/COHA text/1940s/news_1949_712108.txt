txt WASHINGTON , June 10 ? The National Military Establishment and the Army moved with almost unprecedented speed today to defend , fully and without reservation , the loyalty , character , and public service of Gordon R. Clapp , chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority . Mr. Clapp , by what has since been described as an " error , " had been found " unemployable " for an assignment with the Military Government in Germany . Mr. Clapp said last night that he had never heard of the offer and that he had never been approached on it . Gordon Gray , newly appointed Secretary of the Army , first informed of the Army 's action last night , said today that the Army had never investigated Mr. Clapp and " has absolutely no derogatory information about him which would warrant his not being employed by the Army for security or any other reasons . " " Both personally and officially , " Mr. Gray continued , " I most sincerely regret any aspersions upon // ARMY TERMS BAN ON CLAPP AN ' ERROR ' // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outstanding citizen . " A statement to the press by the National Military Establishment added that examination of its files , including those of the Army General Staff 's Military Intelligence Division , " shows nothing reflecting on Mr. Clapp which , in any way , would cause the Department of the Army to question his loyalty or employability under Military Intelligence standards of security or for any other reason . " The word " unemployable , " this statement explained , was used as a result of " an unreviewed action by a junior officer , acting upon a request for personnel received from Military Government in Germany . " Mr. Gray confirmed that Mr. Clapp " knew nothing of this matter , " and added that the situation developed from " an unfortunate misinterpretation of the word ' unemployable . ' " The unintended reflection on Mr. Clapp was promptly assailed in Congress by Senator Estes Kefauver , Democrat of Tennessee . On the Senate floor , the Senator praised the TVA chairman as " a man of great ability and of unimpeachable integrity and loyalty . " Kefauver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mr. Clapp was being " smeared . " He attacked the Army for its failure either to clarify the meaning of its intelligence reports on Mr. Clapp or to identify the spokesman in Frankfort who made the disclosure . " Certainly , " he declared , " if ' charges are to be made against a person in high government posiItion , the person making the charges should be quoted directly to the newspapers , and we ought to know who the person is who is making the charges , and what the charges are . " Tao many people never read beneath the headlines . I think in this instance , where the good name of an unimpeachable man , a great public servant , has been defamed on the front page of THE NEW YORK TIMES , many people will read the smear and will forever think he is the wrong sort of person to have in Government , whereas later ' on if an explanation is printed , it , is usually on the back pages of the newspapers , not on the front . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some newspapers are to blame also . If they print derogatory statements which have no substantiation , they ought to give the same prominence to the reply . They seldom do . " ? Dispatch from Frankfort THE NEW YORK TIMES dispatcii was a report of facts supplied by a member of the Military Government at Frankfort . It was this official of the Army who said that Mr. Clapp had been found " unemployable " for undisclosed reasons . The Army Intelligence bivision confirmed this to THE TIMES yes , terday , but likewise would not explain further . Last night Mr. Clapp was interviewed at the National Airport , where he had flown from Knoxville . Then , he explained that he had never been approached by the Army about the job and that he knew nothing about the Intelligence Division reports about him . Mr. Kefauver also sent telegrams today to President Truman , Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson and Secretary Gray . To the President , he asserted that " this business of smearing the names of good citizens on unsubstantiated reports has gone too far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " full and complete explanation of this matter . " His telegrams to Secretaries Johnson and Gray also requested a full report , " together with names of any persons making reports or charges . " Tydings Names Committee In response to another request by the Tennessee Senator , Senator Millard E. Tydings , chairman of the Senate Armed Service Committee , named Mr. Kefauver chairman of a special subcommittee to investigate the Army action . Secretary Gray meanwhile wired Mr. Clapp , repeating his statement to the press , as follows : " The Department of the Army has never investigated Mr. Gordon Roger Clapp and has absolutely no derogatory information about him which would warrant his not being employed by the Army for securay or any other reasons . " A preliminary investigation reveals that Mr. Clapp knew nothing about this matter and that the situation has developed from an unfortunate misinterpretation of the word ' unemployable ' which : was contained in a cable in March , 1949 , from the department to Army headquarters in Germany . Both personally and officially I most sincerely regret any aspersions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this outstanding citizen . " The procedures which resulted in this error were changed in April , 1949 . Had the present procedures been in effect in March , the error would not have occurred . The circumstances resulting in the error are being investigated and all the pertinent facts will be made public as soon as they are available . " It is my intention to tell the complete story when I have assembled the facts . Please accept my deep personal regrets that this incident has occurred . " A Partial Explanation A partial explanation was provided by the Military Establishment late this afternoon in a memorandum to the press . The statement said that the original request for personnel received from Germany had asked that the Army obtain any one of seven listed Americans to conduct a series of public forums " on personnel practices in creation of a sound German civil service . " The screening of information on the listed persons led a " junior offider " to the conclusion that " Mr. Clapp 's qualifications did not recommend him as the choice for this assignment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this decision , " it went on , " he used the word ' unemployable ' in connection with Mr. Clapp 's name in a cable he sent to Military Government headquarters in Germany . " Mr. Clapp was not requested by the Army to accept a post or informed that he was being considered for one . " The memorandum concluded : " Steps to assure proper supervision of the processing of such matters were taken on April 28 by Assistant Secretary of the Army Tracy S. Voorhees , who had determined that the then-existing procedures were unsound . The system was at fault ; the system has been changed . " Meanwhile the repercussions were so strong in the Army that a shake-up of personnel in the Intelligence Division seemed as likely as the already-completed revision of " procedures . " There was special criticism of officers here who were inclined to make the mystery and suspicion of the original story even deeper by refusing to explain the term " unemployable " and at the same time to insist that- " further comment " come from Mr. Clapp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
