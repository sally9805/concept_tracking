txt The Senate in a surprise move today passed by 27 votes to 25 the Logan-Walter bill subjecting rules and regulations of administrative agencies to judicial review and sent it back to the House with restrictive amendments which , nevertheless , House sponsors of the legislation predicted would be accepted . If the House concurs on the amendments the legislation will go to President Roosevelt for approval , with Congressional leaders predicting an almost certain veto . Mr. Roosevelt , when asked at his press conference as to his attitude , said he had not read the bill . The legislation has been opposed bitterly by the Administration for nearly two years , and the decision of Senator Barkley , the majority leader , to let it come to a vote took the Senate by surprise . Ten Democrats joined with a solidly voting Republican group of seventeen to pass the bill . All of those voting against it were Democrats . This was accomplished in about an hour . The Senate then unanimously confirmed the appointment of Dr. Harry A. Millis of the University of Chicago to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Senate also confirmed the appointment of Representative John J. Dempsey of New Mexico to the Maritime Commission . Smith Bill Amendments Shelved Dr. Millis 's appointment previously had been approved by the Senate Committee on Education and Labor after he appeared before the committee this morning . The committee chairman , Senator Thomas of Utah , informed the Senate he could see no point to bringing up the House-approved Smith bill amendments modifying the National Labor Relations Act . He declared that there would be a conflict between the amendments and the Logan-Walter bill , The announcement was taken to mean that all hope of Senate consideration of the Smith amendments at this session was gone . Senator Taft of Ohio charged that the committee had sought to prevent senate consideration of the amendments and denounced the Labor Board for what he termed " the grossest perversion of justice in the history of this country . " The Administration 's strategy on the Logan-Walter bill , according to several Senators , was to send the measure to the House with amendments necessitating appointment of a conference committee if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed by the Senate Judiciary Committee . Representative Francis Walter of Pennsylvania , co-author of the bill with the late Senator M. M. Logan of Kentucky , immediately announced , instead , that he would ask the House to accept the amendments , which thus would send the bill to the White House . Senator Barkley also had virtually invited the Senate to go home , thus making most improbable a chance for further Senate action , if it was necessary . House Quorum an Issue The Administration had banked on the House not having a quorum to do business , but Representative Walter declared that if the question of a quorum was raised he would move to obtain one by sending the sergeant at arms to arrest the absent members and bring them in . Representative Walter said the administrative agencies chiefly affected by the bill would be the National Labor Relations Board , the Securities and Exchange Commission , the Federal Communications Commission , the Public Buildings Administration and the Bituminous Coal Commission . Several agencies were exempted from its terms . The Senate , meeting at noon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour , when it twice failed to find a quorum . The sergeant at arms was instructed to round up absent members , and in a few minutes Senator Herring was escorted to the chamber . Senator Bilbo arrived a few minutes later to complete the quorum . Cries of " Vote , vote , " rose as Senator Barkley said the opponents were ready to vote if the proponents wanted to waive further discussion . The roll was called and the Senate for a second time passed the bill . The first time was early last year when it was approved unanimously , without a record vote , only to be recalled from the House on request of Senator Barkley , who , with other Administration leaders , had been taken by surprise . What the Bill Would Do The bill , as amended by the Senate , provides that administrative rules and all amendments to existing rules affecting persons or property shall be issued by the heads of agencies only after publication in the Federal register and after notice of public hearings . Such rules must be published within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without such publication , unless in a public emergency . Within a year after publication of such rules , any person interested may request a hearing , which will be conducted by an intra-agency board of three , one of whom must be a lawyer . Ordinary rules of evidence will obtain , a record must be kept of the procedure and the record may become a part of an appeal from such board ruling , the appeal to be taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia or to other Circuit Courts of Appeals . The bill provides that no person shall he penalized or subjected to any forfeiture or prosecuted for any act done or omitted to be done in good faith in conformity with a rule which has been rescinded or declared invalid on appeal , unless the act was done or omitted to be done more than thirty days after publication in the Federal Register of the rescission or final judgment on such rule . Would Expedite Appeal &; Courts of Appeal are authorized to sit in special sessions to expedite appeals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ validity of the rules , on the following findings : 1 . That the decision of the agency was not supported by findings of fact . 2 . That the decision was issued without due notice and a reasonable opportunity for a full and fair hearing . 3 . That the decision was beyond the jurisdiction of the agency or independent agency . 4 . That the decision infringed on the Constitution or Federal statutes . The courts would have power to impose a reasonable penalty as part of the costs upon a person who clearly intended delay as the only reason for his appeal . Rulings of the following agencies were specifically exempted from appeal : Those of the military or naval establishments ; the State Department , Federal Reserve Board , Controller of the Currency , Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , Railroad Retirement Board , National Mediation Board , National Railroad Adjustment Board , I. C. C. , Civil Service Commission , or any issue concerning internal revenues , customs , patents , trade-marks , copyright , personnel , or longeshoremen and harbor workers ' law , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office is exempted in part . The detailed vote on the LoganWalter bill follows : TABLE The bill was opposed , according to Senator Barkley , because it would place a large part of the executive establishment rules under judicial review , a course which , he , said , would mean the virtual control of the executive by the judiciary . contrary to the dividing line established by the Constitution . Sabotage Penalties Voted By The Associated Press . WASHINGTON , Nov. 26 ? The Senate unanimously approved legislation today imposing drastic penal-1 ties for sabotage in national defense industries or against defense materials . By a voice vote it passed legislation previously approved by the House which would impose a fine of $10,000 and ten years in prison for conviction . The legislation , which now goes to the White House for the President 's signature , amended a 1918 law . The amendments would broaden this legislation to include national defense materials and industries , including utilities supplying factories or military establishments . Barkley Will Advise a Veto By The United Press . WASHINGTON , Nov. 26 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to President Roosevelt that he veto the Logan-Walter bill adopted by the Senate . " I certainly will , " he stated . He added that , although he was not authorized to speak for the President , he would not be surprised if the bill were vetoed . " Why , " he continued , " it would hobble every department of government to such an extent that it would be impossible to do anything . During the Supreme Court fight , Senators complained that the executive department was attempting to infringe on the courts , and now they vote to allow the courts to infringe on the executive departments . " Originally proposed by the American Bar Association , the bill is designed to halt what Administration critics termed a drift toward de-1 struction of judicial powers . AntiNew Dealers charged that thel growth of quasi-judicial agencies threatens to make the executive , branch superior in power to the legislative and judicial branches , contrary to the dividing line established by the constitution .                 @ @ @ @
