IT 'S getting so you ca n't tell some operating rooms from the stage of Carnegie Hall . You hear a Mozart sonata as they stick a needle into your spine , and Beethoven 's Fifth as they roll you over on your back . Then , as the gentlemen in white start rummaging around for your appendix , Judy Garland 's sweet young voice suggests it may be , Somewhere Over the Rainbow . Finally , you are cued back to your room and the inevitable conversation about your operation with They 'll Never Believe Me . Maybe they wo n't believe you , at first . Actually , all this surgical serenading does seem somewhat out of character for a hospital . But it is really a serious effort by experts in anesthesia to soften the emotional shock of operations and to assure a smoother and more rapid convalescence . The music is offered either as a prelude to unconsciousness  --  that is , just before a general anesthetic  --  or as a distraction to keep the patient 's mind off his incision while he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numb , but awake . The great majority of patients who have sampled the medical melodies , as well as the surgeons and nurses , swear they are one of the most welcome innovations in years . To date , only a few hospitals are serving symphonies with the ether . The most elaborate program , aided by a grant from the Office of Naval Research , is that of the University of Chicago 's Billings Hospital , where modern wire and tape recorders are used in the revival of this age-old aid to medicine . Anesthetists in a few other hospitals are employing music on a more modest scale  --  singing lullabies to child patients , for example  --  and many institutions are showing interest in the development . Considering that 9,000,000 people are wheeled into operating rooms to receive anesthetics each year in the United States , the potential load of adult jitters and childish tears to be carried away on the wings of song is a real challenge . Music is only one  --  although to the patients probably the most popular  --  of several recent developments aimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meters have been designed to keep better check on the patient 's air supply and thus to avoid periods of oxygen starvation with their serious consequences . A low spinal , or " saddleblock , " anesthesia is one of the most talked-about subjects in obstetrics . Mothers like it because it not only dulls their pain but lets them stay awake and hear the baby 's first cry . Curare is being employed with intravenous and other anesthetics to increase the muscle relaxation desired by the surgeon . The whole science of anesthesia , in fact , has become exceedingly complex . Once regarded as a rather simple service which could be performed by almost anybody who happened to be on hand ? the doctor 's wife or the patient 's son ? anesthesia is today a fullfledged medical specialty to which approximately 5000 physicians in the United States and Canada are giving all or part of their time . Dr. Henry S. Ruth , head of the department of anesthesia at Hahnemann Medical College , in Philadelphia , and editor of the journal , Anesthesiology , points out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his kit and more responsibilities on his shoulders than ever before . He must select the material and the technique " that will provide the greatest safety for the patient and the best operating conditions for the surgeon . " In doing this he must sometimes try to dissuade the patient who insists upon or objects to a certain anesthetic purely on the basis of personal whim , for the patient 's own condition and the type of operation should be the main factors in making a choice , Doctor Ruth points out . The anesthesiologist must also Watch the patient during every second of the operation , and must supervise injection of blood or other fluids . And before the operation itself he must gauge not only the physical but t lie mental and emotional status of the patient . " For apprehensive patients , " Doctor Ruth explains , " require larger doses of anesthetic and have a less satisfactory anesthesia than the more calm and emotionally stable patients . " Actually , anxiety and apprehension are often the worst part of the whole hospital experience and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than does the surgeon 's knife . Yet the skilled anesthetist can dispel Many of these fears . It takes a little time , a little common-sense psychology and occasionally , as we have indicated , a few well-chosen bars of music . Dr. Vincent J. Collins , anesthesiologist at a New York hospital , editorializing in the journal , Anesthesiology , takes his colleagues to task for having neglected this phase of their work . The psychological aspect , he says , " has been forgotten in our overly scientific approach to anesthesia . Many of us havebeen dealing with machines and not patients . In particular we are to be criticized for our handling of children . The prevalent picture of a crying , struggling , wide-eyed , terrified child seems to be accepted by many as a necessary evil , and the anesthesia is chiefly accomplished by brute force . Such a situation is completely unnecessary and is actually intolerable . Those anesthetists who have children Doctor Collins has a small daughter ) will agree , and those without children should take heed . " A sandyhaired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all kids , he pleads for a return to a few " old fundamentals , " some of which , with variations , are as applicable to adults as to children . Out of this World via Pleasant Dreams T is important to remember , he states , that hearing I is the last of the senses to be blotted out by the anesthetic . It is abnormally active just as the patient " goes under , " and sounds then seem magnified or distorted , as though one were listening to them at the bottom of a well . This being the case , it is simple kindness to eliminate all clatter and harsh noises from the vicinity of the operating room . Such a precaution , says Doctor Collins , will do more than any other single thing to assure a calm second stage of anesthesia . The second stage is a dream state , in which some people feel they are floating or whirling , or that everything is receding from them as they sink slowly down into that well . These sensations can be agreeable or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pleasant sounds will float the patient into pleasant dreams . A low , comforting , reassuring voice ? talkirg or singing to the patient  --  will help a great deal , says the New York doctor , who notes that " vocal anesthesia is the oldest sedative we have , and we ought to use it more . " As far as music is concerned , Doctor Collins ' only equipment is his friendly baritone voice and his wife 's collection of nursery songs . These she acquired in the course of teaching music to officers ' children at West Point while her husband was in the Army Medical Corps . One of the doctor 's favorites is the Lollypop Shop , just alliterative enough to induce drowsiness . After a few minutes of the Lollypop Shop the most spoiled four-year-old quiets down and is ready to take the ether , which is often made even more acceptable with a few drops of oil of spearmint . Of course , it is essential for the operating-room soloist to get into the lullaby mood . An anesthetist friend of Doctor Collins overlooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farm in basso-profundo tones that practically blasted hislittle patient off the table  --  and then denounced the " sing-'em-to-sleep " technique as a failure . The scientific sandman supplements his songs with a few other tricks that help children over the awesome threshold of hospital surgery . He visits the patient the afternoon before the operation , if possible , shows him the anesthesia mask , lets him play with it and pretend it 's the kind the jet pilots wear . Next morning the child greets the anesthetist as an old friend and the mask as a harmless and interesting toy . In the operating room , Dr. Robert M. Smith , chief anesthetist at Boston Children 's Hospital , introduces the shiny , gadget-studded anesthesia apparatus to small patients as a " dream machine , " with one spigot for ice-cream dreams , another for dreams about lollypops , and switches for orange , lemon or peppermint to flavor the dream confections . It 's a wonderful dodge . Parents and children alike will applaud Doctor Smith 's dictum against holding a young patient down on the table as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , to let the child 's hands be free , either to hold the ether mask himself or to clasp an assistant 's hand ? " for companionship , not restraint . " Tact and gentle handling are particularly important in the case of the young one brought in for emergency surgery , even for such minor things as setting a broken arm or sewing up a cut finger . For both he and his parents are usually upset and excited over the accident . " The erroneous methods of handling such unfortunate children , " Doctor Smith remarked at a meeting of the American Society of Anesthesiologists , " include one or more needle jabs , followed by a long , agonizing wait . Then the patient is suddenly torn from his parents and forced down on a table under an ether mask . Stifled cries echo back to the listening ears of the father and mother . Giving of anesthesia is accompanied by intense , prolonged excitement and , if the child has recently eaten , by nausea and vomiting . Relaxation for surgery is poor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours of nausea and vomiting . All this for a cut finger . " If , on the other hand , the procedure is carried out with proper regard for the child 's emotions , and if the parents are allowed to stand by him while the anesthetic is administered , the patient will be much calmer , Doctor Smith said , and will usually be ready to go home within a half hour after the cut is sewed up . For major operations , most hospitals prefer not to have the parents in the operating room . The therapeutic use of music is , of course , not new . It is as old as Egypt and the incantations of the Pharaoh 's physicians . The ( Continued on Page 61 ) ( Cunt ' d front Page 58 ) couple of pieces of meat , walked over to Tana and gave them to him , afterward relaying Loring 's orders . Tana accepted the meat with thanks , put it in the buckskin bag hanging from his empty bandoleer , listened to the orders , rose and started off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , and Ward returned to Linus . " What about it ? " Linus asked , looking at him searchingly . " We 'll see . " " Hell , that 'll be too late , " Linus protested . " I meant , I 'll see . " He watched Tana drink at the springs , then vanish around a point of rock to the east . Linus saw it , too , and he glanced at Ward . " He 's got a head start on you already . " " No ; in a few minutes he 'll be in those rocks above the springs . He 'll watch there for a while to see if he 's being followed , before he moves on . " He picked up the canteen and unscrewed the lid . " You go do your soldiering . I 'll sleep for a while where he can see me . " Ward drank and afterward lay down in the shade of the rock , facing the springs . He mentally segmented the top of the mesa above the water hole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When a trooper passed , he closed his eyes as if sleeping , but at the end of twenty minutes he had seen 110 movement . He waited five minutes longer , then rose and walked back through the lounging troopers past the picket line and the lounging but alert guard at the far end of the mesa . Once clear , he turned north and set out at an easy jog , and on clearing the mesa , he cut east again , holding to the same steady SING ME TO SLEEP , DOCTOR ( Continued front Page 31 ) Greeks believed the soft , melodious notes of the flute would relieve sciatica and almost anything else . Primitive tribes in every part of the world have leaned on the curative value of chants and songs . Their medicine men emphasized the magic or supernatural power of their vocal offerings , but it was doubtless the psychological impact of the music upon the patients which produced the favorable effects . Modern doctors have given music a try from time to time . In 1892 Dr. J. Ewing Hunter reported that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pain in many patients , " and in seven out of ten , fever was lowered . " One of the first to try phonograph music in the operating room was Dr. Evan O'Neill Kane , of Kane , Pennsylvania . He reported it briefly but favorably in the Journal of the American Medical Association in July , 1914 . Music might have been more widely used before now if it had not required extra manpower . That difficulty seems to have been overcome largely by the use of magnetic recording apparatus . Chief credit for this recent step in the development belongs to a redheaded Young veteran named Joel Willard . Now on the staff of the Chicago Musical College , which has a department of music therapy , he was inspired to try the wire recorders in the operating room by a nurse friend who told him one evening that a patient of hers had been emotionally upset by hearing the trot . He crossed one trail , took to the rocks at the base of Cardinal Mesa 's steep slope a half mile north of the springs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mesa was little more than a hogback . Keeping to the rocks and bent low , he crossed the ridge , and when he could see the country to the east and south , he halted , bellied down and searched the far country intently . Presently , on the flats below , Tana came into sight . He was traveling at a trot on the faintly defined trail toward the east . Now and then he would pause like a coursing dog halted by a vagrant scent , and kneel beside the trail . Then , at last , he wheeled away from it and headed up the canyon north to cut the north trail . He was , Ward saw , obeying Loring 's orders , for if he intended flight he would not have bothered with this elaborate pretense . And yet the uneasiness , residue of suspicion , still lingered within Ward . He pulled off the hogback , returning to camp by the same route , and now the heat of midday was bright and cruel . The troopers lay clustered in any shade they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to water in fours , and the camp was beaten into silence by the heat . Someone had rigged up an awning by propping up blankets ; Loring was sleeping under it , and Ward could see Linus down at the potholes . He slacked under an edge of the blankets ' shade , and presently Tana hove in sight , had his drink at the springs , and returned to the partial shade of the boulder . He and Ward eyed each other blandly for a quiet moment , and then Tana reported . A band of five headed east had left the potholes yesterday ; all other tracks surgeons talking and clicking their instruments during an operation done under a spinal anesthetic . " Why not stop up the patient 's ears with earphones , so she ca n't hear the operating-room sounds , " Willard.suggested , " and then play soft music into them ? " " That 's a swell idea , " the nurse replied . Neither she nor Willard had at that time beard of the previous experiments in this direction . " Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willard took his plan to the University of Chicago 's Billings Hospital and to the head of its anesthesia department , Dr. Huberta M. Livingstone  --  associate professor of surgery ? in private life Mrs. William E. Adams , the wife of a surgeon . She and her associate , Dr. Geraldine A. Light , took to'the suggestion at once , and the group pitched into the task of selecting appropriate music and arranging equipment that would not interfere with the other activities of the surgical floor . Willard eventually designed a tape recorder that would play all day without attention , repeating the program only every four hours . The night before the operation the anesthesiologist goes to the patient 's room , slips to the bedside , pencil poised over his chart book like an attentive waiter about to take an order , and asks , " What kind of music will you have , sir ? We have classical , semiclassical , popular , and children 's music and stories . " After recovering from the shock of such unexpected service , the patient makes his choice  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 per cent say popular and only 9 per cent classical . In the " prep " room , where the patient is prepared for surwere more than three days old . There was dust of a party traveling far to the south , too far to see , but they were coming this way . Later he could tell . As he was talking , Ward saw Linus start toward the camp at half walk , half trot . A shower of pebbles cascaded down the talus , and Trooper Corteen , Storrow 's signalman , slid into sight from the mesa top , braking himself , and then coming up to Loring , who wakened . Loring read the note Corteen handed him , and then extended it to Linus , who had joined them . Linus shared with Ward the note , which read : " Engaged band midmorning . Action broken off after skirmish . Big band sixty-eighty pulled off Peak . Holly says for Cardinal Springs . Have lost contact , but am pursuing with also one troop Craig . Wolverton . " " So they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumph . " When 'll they reach us , Kinsman ? " ? " Noon tomorrow , maybe . " Loring turned to Corteen . " Get Sergeant Mack , " he ordered , and then he saw Tana and smiled at him . He turned to Ward and asked for Tana 's report . Ward told him of the dust sighted , and Loring said , " Ask him how far away ? " Ward did , and Tana answered ; and now , listening to him , Ward felt the solid shock of excitement . He said to Loring , " Three hours , maybe . In a couple of hours he 'd like to look again . " " Tell him to , " Loring said . Ward did , and looking at Tana now , he thought , That 's the first mistake you made , my friend . And that one is enough . For Tana had lied . There had been no dust , and yet in two hours he wanted to look for it . ( TO BE CONTINUED ) gery , the anesthetist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready for the operating room  --  assuming he is under a " spinal " ? light plastic stethoscope-type earpieces are fitted over his head and the music turned to " silent . " This means that only the patient hears it , although the anesthetist may monitor it to keep check on the volume . The music is such an effective distraction that frequently , as the operation is about half over a patient will ask : " When are they going to start ' ? " Patients are outspoken in their musical likes and dislikes . One woman was drifting happily along with Beethoven 's Second Piano Concerto , but when the spool switched over to Stravinsky 's Third Symphony , she moaned , " Oh , please ! Do I have to listen to that ? There 's too much discord . " The surgical sonatas have been played for almost every type of operation . They have been unusually helpful to peptic-ulcer patients , who are already so tense and nervous that routine medical sedatives are not very effective . The music does a much better job of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the abdominal operations at Billings Hospital are done under spinal anesthesia , which leaves the patients conscious . Surgeons like the music in this situation because they are then free to talk about their work as they go along  --  a necessary procedure in a teaching hospital ? without fear of upsetting the subject of their discussion . The latter 's ears are tuned only to the music , and he ca n't hear the doctors . Some patients feel this arrangement cheats them of important information . They want to hear the gruesome details then and there . ( Continued on Page 63 ) 61 often said he 'd like a machine " so arranged that when the anesthetic concentration got too high ( and thus the oxygen too low ) it would ring a bell , run up a flag or blow a whistle . " Recently , two of his young associates , Drs . Albert Faulconer and Roger W. Ridley , aided by R. E. Jones , of the Mayo Clinic 's engineering department , have rigged up an elaborate device which achieves this result , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does , however , flash a light , and in wiggly lines on a long roll of paper it writes a running commentary on the patient 's progress . The apparatus makes a continuous analysis of the anesthetic-and-oxygen mixture actually going into and out of the patient 's lungs . It also clocks his blood pressure , heartbeat , respiration , and oxygen content of the blood . It can also record electrocardiograms and brain waves if desired . This electronic watchdog is designed only for research purposes , but it is expected to give useful answers to basic questions . " For forty years there has been an argument , for example , over exactly how much ether is required to produce anesthesia , " Doctor Faulconer said . " The calculations have varied all over the lot . You knew how much you were putting into the mask , but you did n't know how much the patient was absorbing . " Now , with the analyzer , it is possible to measure the actual dose of ether taken up by the patient 's lungs . As a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances . It takes a lot of ether to put an alcoholic under , because ether is Himil4 to alcohol and his system is used to alcohol . A person in shock , on the other hand , needs very little anesthetic . A simpler gadget to safeguard the patient 's oxygen supply  --  one which may eventually become standard operating-room equipment  --  is the " oxyhemograph , " developed at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit . It is the result of research by Dr. Roy D. McClure , surgeon in chief at the hospital , Dr. Frank W. ? Hartman , chief pathologist , Dr. Vivian G. Behrmann , physiologist , and Dr. Charles F. Kettering , the noted inventor and engineer , of General Motors . The perils of oxygen starvation ? an'oxia , as the doctors call it ? have beenof concern to Doctor McClure for many years . The damage may be so severe as to cause death or insanity , he says , or so slight that the effects almost escape notice by the patient 's own family . Doctor McClure tells of a university coed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She came to a Midwestern city one morning to have a tooth extracted , under nitrous-oxide anesthesia . A few hours later she noticed that her sight was blurred . She did not connect this with the tooth extraction , but consulted an eye specialist , who prescribed a change of glasses . On her return to school she began to do poorly in her work , and before the term ended she had flunked out . A possible explanation for this sudden change in her scholastic achievement came some months later , when she went back to the same dentist for another extraction . " For heaven 's sake , " he told her , " do n't let anybody ever give you gas again . You just ca n't take it . " She then learned that during the previous dental operation she had turned blue and bad required artificial respiration . Doctor McClure feels that the period of oxygen lack had so injured her brain cells that her mental ability and vision had been impaired . One should not conclude from this incident that nitrous oxide is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skilled hands if used for very brief or light anesthesia , such as is required for most tooth extractions . But in order to produce prolonged or deep anesthesia with nitrous oxide , it must be used in such heavy concentrations that only a small amount of oxygen remains in the breathing mixture , and this , of course , may expose the patient to serious hazard , Doctor McClure explains . Actually an oxygen deficiency may occur with any type of anesthetic agent or it may result from a sudden drop in blood pressure during the operation , with consequent stagnation of the circulation to the brain . The Ford Hospital oxyhemograph is designed to give immediate warning of a low oxygen level in the blood regardless of its cause . The heart of the instrument is the little ear-lobe oxygen meter , which clamps on like an earring . It was designed by Kurt Kramer , in Germany , ' Pd on Page 64 ) 66 THE SATURDAY ( Con f ? .1 from 1 ' 41 ; 44 , 61 ) improved by the late Dr. Glenn A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used during wartime aviation research to measure oxygen levels in high-altitude fliers . A small light shines through the skin of the ear lobe and falls on a photoelectric cell , or " electric eye . " The latter is so sensitive that it responds to the slight variations in blood color caused by changes in the oxygen saturation of the hemoglobin , the red pigment of the blood . In the Ford Hospital apparatus , the electronic " blinks " of the electric eye are amplified 1,000,000 times  --  this was Doctor Kettering 's main contribution  --  and come out in a wavy line on the record paper , where they can be instantly read in terms of percentage of normal oxygen concentration . By watching this blood line on the oxyhemograph the anesthetist can tell at once when the oxygen supply to the patient has dropped into the danger zone or when , because of poor heart action or obstructed circulation , the inhaled oxygen is not being properly distributed through the body . The oxygen meter has already been a lifesaver on several occasions . One morning a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transferred to a stretcher to be taken back to his room . The ear-lobe device was still attached , and Doctor Hartman noticed that the record had suddenly fallen to 58 per cent , definitely too low for safety . " Nurse , nurse ! " he said . " The tongue ! " The nurse knew at once what was wrong and what to do . The patient 's tongue , still abnormally relaxed from the anesthetic , had fallen across the air passage at the back of the throat and was gagging him . The nurse lifted the man 's chin up , and this moved the tongue out of the way . With the air passage clear again , the blood-oxygen line rose rapidly and reached 92 per cent within a minute . Choking on the tongue is a familiar hazard , and every well-trained anesthetist knows how to guard against it . But this incident was a sharp reminder that patients must be watched constantly until they are far enough out of the anesthesia to manage their own tongues . As a matter of fact , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coupled with respiratory obstruction of this and other types during the postoperative period , was a contributing cause of death in nearly a third of the anesthetic fatalities investigated . In " blue-baby " operations at the Ford Hospital the oxygen meter has been a particularly valuable aid . Here the faulty circulation to the lungs has already made the blood low in oxygen . and hence bluish in color , and while the operation is going on the oxygen may go even lower . The oxyhemograph keeps a constant check on this critical factor and warns the anesthetist when extra oxygen is needed . On one occasion a man of twenty-one , suffering from the blue-baby abnormality , was on the operating table when his blood pressure fell so low it could n't be measured . Nor could the doctors feel his pulse or detect any breathing . Yet the oxygen meter showed that his blood was still circulating and also indicated faint respirations . Guided by these signs of life , the physicians continued to pump oxygen into the lungs and injected adrenalin to stimulate his heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As his chest was opened by the surgeons the oxygen level fell into the danger zone , and again his pulse and blood pressure disappeared . Once more artificial respiration and a heart stimulant were applied , and again the heart and lungs took hold . The surgeons were able to finish their work successfully after a total of five hours , and they credited the little oxygen meter with having caught danger signals in time and with having helped bring the youth through . Safer anesthesia is achieved not only by watchdog instruments but by improvements in the chemical compounds and in the methods of administering them . A technique now being widely discussed and evaluated by the anesthesiologists is a combination of Pentothal sodium and curare . Pentothal sodium itself has been used for a number of years . It is given by vein , and is popular with patients because it puts them to sleep so pleasantly and quickly . However , it does n't relax the abdominal muscles as much as the surgeons would Jan linry 29. 1919 like , and it occasionally produces spasms of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Griffith , of the Homeopathic Hospital , of Montreal , discovered that these drawbacks could be largely eliminated by giving along with the anesthetic a small dose of curare , the South American Indianarrow poison , which produces tempo ' - rary muscle paralysis . Anesthetists realized there was some danger , in using curare , that it might so completely paralyze the patient that he could n't let the doctor know when it hurt , could n't say ouch or even flinch . Dr. Scott M. Smith , of the University of Utah Medical School , proved this by letting himself be curarized to the point where he could n't bat an eyelash and where his breathing had to be done for him by a respirator . When an associate pricked him with a pin , he could feel the pain all right , but he could n't tell about it until later . So far , however , the Pentothal has kept the pain nerves dulled sufficiently so that patients have not felt pain during the operation . Dr. Joe W. Baird , Dr. R. T. Knight and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pentothalcurare mixture on more than 5000 patients of all ages , from four months to ninety-four years . They feel it is particularly valuable in elderly , chronic , debilitated patients , and in those who are extremely poor surgical risks . They warn , however , that it should be employed only by a competent anesthesiologist who has adequate equipment at hand to give artificial respiration , for the curare often paralyzes the breathing muscles temporarily , and the anesthetist must do the patient 's breathing for him . They also advise against curare in the patients with asthma or the muscle weakness known as myasthenia gram 's . Research in the entire field of anesthesia has not only made operatingroom experiences safer and more pleasant for the patients ; it has been partly responsible for the broadened scope of the surgeon 's activities . That surgeons are able to carry out many delicate operations on the brain and within the chest and abdomen , some lasting five or six hours , is largely due to advances in the science and art of putting people to sleep .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
