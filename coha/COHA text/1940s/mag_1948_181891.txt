Almost a year to the day after taking over , La Motte T. Cohu last week abruptly bailed out of his seat as president of Transcontinental &; Western Air , Inc . All the explanation T.W.A. 's stockholders got before he took to the silk was a statement that he had " completed the job " of putting the company back on a straight course . <P> Airline folk thought there was more to it than that . For one thing , T.W.A. was not yet flying smoothly . Due chiefly to Cohu 's payroll slashing , its $8,000,000 loss in 1947 was only a little more than half the loss of 1946 . But only three weeks ago , T.W.A. notified the Civil Aeronautics Board that it was so short of cash that it would be " unable to continue even a semblance of its present service " unless it got a $3.000,000 boost in foreign mail rates-and got it right now . Moreover , only two weeks ago Cohu had been re-elected president-and had said not a word about quitting . <P> Cohu , like Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T.W.A. 's controlling stockholder , Howard Hughes . Cohu asked Hughes for complete authority to run the line , and had suggested that Hughes put his stock into a trusteeship which Cohu could control . Hughes refused and there was nothing left for Cohu to do but get out . Cohu was reportedly set to take a top job with Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corp . Likeliest bet to succeed him in T.W.A. was Lieut . General Harold Lee George ( ret. ) , who ran the ATC during the war , and until recently bossed Peruvian International Airways .
