Abovestairs in his elegant Manhattan saloon , the Stork Club , ex-bootlegger Sherman Billingsley moves with exquisite aplomb . He is the Ward McAllister of caf society . He dispenses a magnum of champagne to a favorite here , a fleeting , boyish smile to an attractive dcolletage there . And he gives mad , mad gifts to the charmed inner circle of his customers . <P> Belowstairs , among the kitchen mechanics , he is the very devil of a fellow , too . There he rations out three beers and a jigger of whiskey twice a day to the cooks and dishwashers . And there , some say , he also goes in for union-busting and Bowery billingsgate . Last week , Local 89 of the A.F.L. 's Chefs , Cooks , Pastry Cooks and Assistants Union had Billingsley up before the state labor relations board . The charge : that by alternate wheedling and bullying he had committed an unfair labor practice and caused the local to lose a bargaining election last May . <P> A Skunk . Sherm was no stranger to the labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told the board that he had bounced them for joining a union ; 2 years later , the state court of appeals bounced them back to Billingsley , told him to cough up back pay . Four of last week 's six witnesses had been fired , a fifth had quit , the sixth had been suspended . <P> Head Kitchenman Manuel Avala testified that , after he had joined the union , Billingsley had him shadowed , hissed at him one day : " You are the skunk of the earth . " Modest Manuel added : " I ca n't tell any of the other things he said . Only on the Bowery is such language used . " <P> An ex-dishwasher named Jos Nozario said that one day before the election he and other kitchen help were summoned upstairs for drinks , cigarettes and neckties-just like Sherm 's customers . Said Jos : " I sat entranced . I never saw anything so pretty . " Sherm advised them to vote against the union . They did . The day after the election , he gave them $100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jos Mercado said he got the $500-and $600 more just before he was to testify at the hearing . He had instructions , he said , to tell the board he worked against the union of his own volition . Billingsley promptly suspended him . Just as promptly , Manhattan 's District Attorney Frank Hogan called for minutes of the hearing to " determine whether there was subornation of perjury . " <P> A Garter . At week 's end , Sherm was waiting to fight back , just as though he did n't have a couple of other legal brawls on his hands . In the U.S. district court in New York , he was being sued for $100,000 by one Raymond Pillois of Paris , who thought that would be a reasonable fee for getting Billingsley an exclusive contract as American agent for a French perfume . In Baltimore , for a change , Sherm was suing . Once more in his career he was trying to get someone to stop using the name Stork Club on a gin mill other than his own . <P> This time it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lurid strip of honky-tonks known as The Block . Bettye not only serves drinks , she has strippers for entertainment . And for free she tosses the mob her garter every night . Such goings-on , Sherm felt , would " impair and cause severe damage " to his reputation .
