Miss Willson is at least 150 years old . If she ever died , nobody knows when or where . If she ever had a first name , nobody knows what it was . About all that remains of Miss Willson is 20 primitive paintings that Manhattan gallery-goers snatched last week ( at prices from $25 to $300 ) from the walls of the Harry Stone Gallery . <P> Faddists of the primitive were fascinated . For Miss Willson 's paintings ( of subjects like General Washington on Horse , The Prodigal Son Receiving His Patrimony , Riotous Living , Henry and His Pet Goat , Lovers ) revealed a forthright , uninhibited graphic touch as clear and gay as sunlight . Typical was General Washington , decorative , naive , fantastic . General and horse were suspended in air , unpropped by Delaware ice cakes or the neoclassic columns of Mount Vernon . The plume on the General 's tricorne hat looked like a Christmas tree . Though utterly alone , the Father of His Country drew rein and fired his pistol . <P> Even more fanciful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow Pelican ( she probably never saw one ) , tattooed with conspicuous crosshatchings , line-and-dot motifs , gaudy flowers . <P> Farmermaid . A spinster , Miss Willson painted in a Greene County , N.Y . farm cabin sometime between 1800 and 1825 . The Willson watercolors are among the earliest primitives in the history of U.S. art . Miss Willson shared her farm life with a hardy settler named Miss Brundage . A kind of 19th-Century Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas , the two women built their own log cabin . Then , while Miss Willson sat down to paint , Miss Brundage tilled the soil . The Willson pictures were sold to farmers and other buyers as far north as Canada , as far south as Mobile . The artist 's colors were as primitive as her style : handmade concoctions of berry juices , brick dust and vegetable dyes , occasionally supplemented with " store paint . " <P> The only known source of information about Miss Willson is an anonymous 19th-Century letter writer . Wrote he : " These two maids left their home in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which continued until the death of the ' farmer maid . ' The artist was inconsolable , and after a brief time , removed to parts unknown . "
