Pierre Gelinas , editor of Montreal 's pro-Communist weekly Combat ( circ. 2,500 ) , had barely settled down to work one day last week when a squad of policemen clumped into his office . Cried 23-year-old Editor Pierre Gelinas : " What the hell have you come here for ? " The cops told him to stand up . They searched him , took away his Labor Progressive ( Communist ) Party card , and hustled him out of the building . They seized 1,000 copies of Combat , and gathered up office files , pamphlets and pictures of Stalin , Molotov and Canadian Communist Leader Tim Buck . Then they sealed the door of the Combat office . <P> That afternoon , many a Montrealer heard the news of the raid and padlocking with shocked alarm . Sputtered Editor Gelinas , at a meeting of Communist students at McGill Union building : " This is just the beginning of Fascism in Quebec . . . . The issue is freedom of the press and freedom of thought . " <P> Montreal 's press kept editorially mum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thundered : " Today the padlock law is used against a paper which is unpopular and weak . Tomorrow it can be used against any political foe which the Union Nationale Government chooses to regard as offensive . " <P> Orders for the raid had come directly from Premier Maurice Duplessis , who ( as Attorney General ) is both executor and sponsor of the 1937 padlock law banning the use of premises for disseminating Communist propaganda " by any means whatsoever . " In the 32 months before he went out of office in November 1939 , Duplessis used the law eleven times . Until last week , he had not used it once since his return to power in August 1944 . Now , with provincial elections just around the corner , the law seemed just the ticket for the anti-Red campaign which is supposed to bring in many Duplessis votes .
