By presidential order last week , Defense Secretary James Forrestal took command of the three top lieutenants who will administer the service arms of his new , unified defense establishment . As expected , they were : <P> Secretary of the Army , hulking , even-tempered Kenneth C. Royall , former Under Secretary of War and Secretary since Bob Patterson 's resignation last month , a onetime North Carolina lawyer , wartime brigadier general in the Army Service Forces , whose ambition is to run for governor of North Carolina . <P> Secretary of the Navy , New Hampshire 's John L. Sullivan , well-traveled Under Secretary of the Navy , onetime Assistant Secretary of the Treasury , a faithful Democrat and good friend of National Chairman Bob Hannegan . <P> Secretary of the Air Forces , Socialite-Industrialist W. Stuart Symington , who left the presidency of St. Louis ' Emerson Electric Manufacturing Co. , became Surplus Property Administrator , then a top-notch Assistant Secretary of War for Air , the aggressive , Yale-trained son-in-law of New York 's defense-conscious Representative James W. Wadsworth.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
