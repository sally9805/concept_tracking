The U.S. people no longer wondered whether the U.S. was in . They wondered now whether the U.S. was winning . <P> From the established evidence it did not look as if the U.S. Navy , famous for equipment and famous for morale , was making a very good start in winning the Battle of the Atlantic . On the docket for all to see were the sinking of the Reuben James ( see col. 2 ) , the nicking of the Kearny , the near missing of the Greer . If the crack U.S. Navy had exacted any price from the enemy , it was not public knowledge . <P> No less a pair of authorities than the Secretary of the Navy and its Commander in Chief last week told the U.S. people that even when the Navy had sunk German submarines , the sinking would not become public knowledge ( see p. 17 ) . <P> &gt; Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox said : " Great Britain has been in the war a long time . The Germans have been attacking them with submarines for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great many subs , but the public has heard very little about them . We will be governed by the same policy . If it seems best strategically not to reveal a sinking , we wo n't reveal it . " <P> &gt; President Roosevelt , when questioned on sinkings , would not answer . But he told a little parable : One day in the last war he had flown over the Bay of Biscay in a French blimp . He had taken the controls himself for a bit . The next day the blimp thought it saw a submarine on the seafloor near Penmarch Point , where a U-boat had periodically attacked shipping entering the Loire 's mouth . The blimp put down a buoy . Airplanes and sub-chasers dropped depth charges . An oil slick showed , but the Allies did not claim a submarine . After the war divers went down off Penmarch Point , and there they found a submarine . <P> German submarines have been known to release oil to make the supposedly telltale slick ; they may even put up some wreckage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wreckage were genuine , it would be harder on German crew morale if U-boats simply disappeared with never a word as to where , when , how . <P> In short it is possible that the Navy has drawn blood . But apparently the Navy is not sure .
