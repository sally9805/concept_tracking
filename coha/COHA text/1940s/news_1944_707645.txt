txt An hour and ten minutes before the time fixed for his death in the electric chair in Sing Sing prison , Louis ( Lepke ) Buchalter , once the master of organized prime in this city and overlord of the Brooklyn murder ring that killed more than eighty men , received a two-day stay late last night through the intervention of Governor Dewey . The stay was granted on purely legal grounds , to give the condemned gangster 's lawyer an opportunity to apply to the United States Supreme Court for his client . Charles D. Breitel , counsel to the Governor , made it plain , in announcing the delay , that no request for a respite had come to the Governor 's office from any official source . It was authoritatively indicated further that if the Supreme Court should deny the writ , Lepke would go to the chair tomorrow night without more ado . However , if the court should decide to hear a petition for the writ , Governor Dewey would , of course . grant a reprieve for as long as might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hogan Talks With Lepke Lepke talked for an hour and a half late yesterday afternoon to District Attorney Frank S. Hogan of New York County , who went to Sing Sing at the condemned man 's request . However , Mr. Breitel 's statement clearly implied that Mr. Hogan had learned nothing from the gangster that he felt warranted asking the Governor for a further reprieve . This in turn appeared to dispose of the persistent and widely circulated rumors that Lepke might involve a nationally known labor leader , an even better known politician and a former high official of the Police Department in a thirteen-year-old unsolved Brooklyn killing . It was these rumors , given national circulation during the long fight waged by Governor Dewey 's administration with the Federal Department of Justice for the custody of the condemned man , that accounted for the extraordinary interest that has developed in the case . Spared with Lepke were two of his underlings in the murder ring , Emanuel ( Mendy ) Weiss and Louis Capone . Two other men scheduled to go to the chair with them for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the appointed time . They were Joseph Palmer , 26 years old , and Vincent Sallami , 28 , who killed a detective in Brooklyn Dec. 7 , 1942 . Announcement by Dewey Mr. ' Breitel made his announcement to the reporters waiting outside the Governor 's office in the State Capitol in Albany at 9:50 P. M. His statement was as follows : " Counsel for Louis Buchalter has advised me that he has arranged to make application to the Supreme Court of the United States for a writ of certiorari to be sub-1 mitted at noon on Saturday , March 4 . Accordingly . I have requested Commissioner Lyons to postpone the executions of Louis Buchalter , Emanuel Weiss and Louis Capone until later in this week . Under we circumstances there is no need for a respite by the Governor at this time . " It was explained by persons familiar with the penal law that no formal reprieve by the Governor was necessary , because the sentences imposed on the three men by the courts merely specified that they were to be put to death some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custom , it was pointed out , that executions are normally performed on Thursday nights . When the Governor made his decision , Mr. Breitel telephoned it to John A. Lyons , State Commissioner of Correction , who in turn telephoned Warden William E. Snyder // n his office at Sing Sing . The warden received the call at 9:35 M. and as a customary precauion immediately called back Paul Lockwood , executive secretary to he Governor , who confirmed the ? equest . Priest Gives News to Lepke The Rev. Bernard Martin Roman Catholic chaplain of the prison , hurried to the pre-execution cells , where all five of the condemned men had been waiting since early morning . He broke the news of ne stay for Lepke , Capone and Weiss , while Palmer and Sallami realized that their last hope had vanished . Prison officials who had access to the death house reported that Lepke apparently had remained confident of a last-minute stay . He said nothing when the priest announced the news , but retained the same outwardly cool , pleasant demeanor that has marked him throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the I trio who made an audible remark , and he contented himself with muttering " fine , fine . " Rabbi Jacob Katz , Jewish chaplain of the prison , who was to have accompanied Weiss and Lepke to the chair , was with him at the time . Capone looked astonished , according to those who saw him , but remained silent . Lepke 's wife , Mrs. Beatrice Wasserman Buchalter , had been with him almost the entire day , except for the period in which he was closeted with District Attorney Hogan and two of the latter 's assistants . However , she left the prison at 9:22 P. M. , only a few minutes before the dramatic , lastminute news . Mrs. Buchalter Angered As she was walking to her car outside the prison gates , accompanied by two men whose identities were not learned , she was angered by the activities of newspaper photographers , who rushed up and snapped scores of flash bulbs almost in her face . One of her companions took off his coat and threatened to fight a photographer , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their car and drove off . J. Bertram Wegman , counsel for Lepke , who was in touch with Mr. Breitel frequently during the afternoon and evening , arranged for the filing of the petition of the writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court by long-distance telephone yesterday afternoon , after a three-judge court of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals I had closed the last legal channel here . Mr. Wegman will endeavor to induce the Supreme Court to pass on the constitutionality of the transfer of his client from the Federal prison where he was serving a fourteen-year sentence for narcotics conspiracy to the custody of the New York State authorities . Federal Judge Clarence G. Galston denied Mr. Wegman 's request for a writ of habeas corpus for ' Lepke on this ground Wednesday , and the Circuit Court of Appeals , meeting out of its regular order because of the pressing nature of the issue , affirmed Judge Galston'a ruling yesterday . After the Circuit Court handed down its decision , Mr. Wegman called the clerk of the Supreme Court in Washington by long distance telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ertiorari tomorrow . He announced he would ask Governor Dewey for a respite of at least a week to permit the court to pass on the writ . Outside the gates of Sing Sing , a swarm of reporters and photographers was waiting when Mr. Hogan arrived . He was accompanied by Sol Gelb , chief assistant district attorney , and Joseph A. Sarafite , the new head of the rackets bureau in the District Atorney 's office . Mr. Hogan only smiled when the reporters crowded around him , trying to get him to say whether his visit was in connection with Lepke . But after he and his aides had disappeared within the grim walls of the prison , Clement Ferling , secretary to Warden Snyder , confirmed the fact that they were in the death house talking to the former gang chieftain . Hogan Silent on Interview When they reappeared at 6:55 P. M. , Mr. Hogan admitted he had talked to Lepke at length . He refused , however , to give any indication of whether he would ask Governor Dewey , his friend and political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I came here at the request of Lepke and ' talked to him for about an hour and a half , " he said . " The warden called me . " Reporters pressed him with every question they could think of that might elicit further information , bit Mr. Hogan kept snapping " No comment " to one thrust after another . At last he wearied of the questioning and said : " I have said all I 'm going to say . Any further questions would elicit no information . " When Burton Turkus , the assistant district attorney of Kings County who obtained the murder convictions against Lepke , Weiss and Capone , was informed of Mr. Hogan 's visit , he said : " If District Attorney Hogan and his aides have gone to Sing Sing to see Lepke , then it is my belief that they have gone there to get from I him disclosures about crimes committed in New York County . " This apparently obvious truth offered a puzzling complication , as Ithe murder that has been the subject of the innumerable rumors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brooklyn . It was that of Guido Ferreri , a clothing manufacturer who operated a non-union shop . He was shot and killed on July 31 , 1931 , in the driveway of his home at 1616 Ocean Parkway , Brooklyn . Officials Gathered at Prison Gathered at the prison last night were the principal officials whose presence was required . In addition to Warden Snyder , they included Dr. Charles C. Sweet , prison physician ; Dr. James A. Kearney , assistant prison physician , and Mrs. G. Kenneth McCracken and Joseph Boyle , junior physicians . The executioner who threw the switch that put Palmer and Sallami to death was Joseph Francel , who is paid $150 for each prisoner put to death under his auspices . Palmer entered the death chamber at 11:02 and was pronounced dead at 11:05 . Sallami followed at 11:08 and was declared dead at 11:11 . Sallami had nothing to say , but Palmer protested that he had been " framed . " Mr. Wegman arrived at the office of United States Attorney James B. N. at 2:20 P.M. and they went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerk of the Circuit Court , on the seventeenth floor of the Federal Building . " Mr. Wegman has an appeal to make to the Circuit Court , and it is a very pressing appeal , so that time is of the essence , " Mr. said . Mr. Bell replied that he was sorry , - but that the court was not in session and the appeal would have to wait until its regular hour for sitting , 4 P. M. Mr.+Wegman and Mr. then proceeded to the chambers of Judge Learned Hand on the twenty-fourth floor , where they explained the situation . Judge Hand agreed to convene the court forthwith . Sitting with him were judges A. N. Hand and Thomas W. Swan . Mr. Wegman repeated to the court substantially the same argument that he had advanced in his unsuccessful effort to get the writ from Federal Judge Clarence G. Galston yesterday . He said that the personality of Lepke had little to do with the legal question involved , but that " a vital principle of law " was at stake . He charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is constitutionally the exclusive prerogative of the President , that of attempting to commute a sentence imposed in a Federal court . " I 'd like to concede immediately that if the President had commuted Buchalter 's Federal sentence , Buchalter could interject no objection whatever , " Mr. Wegman said . " But no one but the President has the power to pardon or commute . What the Attorney General is attempting to do is , in effect , commute the Federal sentence by interfering with the judgment of the Federal court 1which sentenced him . " IAnother Reprieve Suggested Mr. Wegman told the court that he had been advised by Governor Dewey 's counsel that the Governor would grant another reprieve in the event that the Circuit Court granted the appeal . While Mr. briefly denied the contentions of the condemned man 's lawyer , acting District Attorney Thomas C. Hughes and Mr. Turkus of Kings County entered the courtroom and listened to the rest of the argument . Judge Learned Hand , senior member of the court , quickly disposed of the issue . " The order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has any interest in being imprisoned . There can be no color for this appeal except on the theory that a convict has an interest in being incarcerated in one place rather than in another . " Lepke Reported Unruffled Meanwhile , the five condemned men waited anxiously in the death house of the prison . Sing Sing officials said all of them were apparently bearing up well and that Lepke , outwardly at least , seemed the most unruffled of the lot . They were removed from their regular cells in the morning , in accordance with the usual procedure , and were bathed and dressed in the black trousers and white shirts that are the customary attire for condemned men to wear to the chair . Then they were transferred to the pre-execution cells , adjoining the passageway leading to the execution chamber . This room , known in prison slang as the " dance hall " because of its large size , is so arranged that the prisoners can not see one another but can hear each other call out . In their regular cells Lepke , Capone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Persons having access to the death house reported that Lepke had been heard to remark : " Something good may happen yet . " Weiss was reported to have said : " I 'll be of good courage . " Capone merely inquired , " Is there any word from the Governor ? " Palmer said : " I have a few hours left , at least , " and Sallami observed that " I 'm hopingg , that 's all . " To allow the five men doomed to die as much time as possible with their families , the seventeen other inmates of the death house voluntarily waived their visiting hours yesterday . All five of the condemned men had visitors , although Palmer 's only caller was a fellow convict , a cousin who was permitted to see him by court order . In , accordance with the traditional death house custom , the condemned men were permitted by Warden Snyder to choose their final meals . Lepke selected a menu of steak , French fried potatoes , lettuce and tomato salad , rolls , pie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roast chicken , potatoes , lettuce and tomato salad , rolls and coffee . Prison officials admitted yesterday that Lepke , soon after his admission to the death house Jan. 21 , had asked that the Rev. Robert E. Brinkman , Protestant chaplain of the Federal House of Detention in Manhattan , where Lepke formerly was held , be admitted to visit him occasionally . He said he desired IMr . Brinkman 's presence as " a spiritual adviser , " although he had described himself as Jewish when he entered the prison . Mr. Brinkman , who visited Lepke for the last time on Monday , declined to discuss the subject of their conversations . New Warden to Be Present Warden Snyder , who assumed that post Jan. 24 , when he succeeded the late Warden Robert J. Kirby , told reporters that he to the chair had not yet been determined , but would be decided by Principal Keeper Thomas Kelley on the basis of the condition of the various individuals . The warden denied that Lepke had made any statement to him . In response to questions from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had heard nothing from the Governor and added : " If the Governor does anything , you fellows will probably hear it before I do . " In this city , meanwhile , Holgar Johnson , head of the Institute of Life Insurance , took cognizance of rumors that Lepke had had his life insured for $1,600,000 . He said he had made a long and exhaustive clieck of the report and that " there seems to be no evidence of any substantial amount of insurance " on the convicted man .
