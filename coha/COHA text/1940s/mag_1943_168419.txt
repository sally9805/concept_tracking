They used to call it the " Misery &; Short Life , " and the " Maimed &; Still Limping . " But last week the Minneapolis &; St. Louis Railroad Co. finally came out of one of the longest receiverships in railroad history . And the bondholders who have stayed with it through 20 long years of bankruptcy finally had a good thing . <P> Worms &; Snails . The M. &; St. L. was a rackety , poor man 's railroad long before it slipped into receivership in 1923 . Begun in the ' 70s by Minneapolitans eager to challenge Chicago 's monopoly of Midwestern railroading , the line stretched itself into 1,690 miles of jerkwater track running north &; south across Minnesota and Iowa , with branches to Peoria and Leola , S. Dak . It never got to St. Louis-and from the day its first track was laid , it was more often in than out of the courts . Its debt was too high , its farm traffic too meager and too seasonal . In the Midwest its sway-backed boxcars , rusty rails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> But somehow , deficit by deficit , worms , snails , puppy dog 's tails and all , the M. &; St. L. creaked along . It took the courts six and a half years - from the time a small creditor threw it into bankruptcy in 1923 - even to get around to ordering a foreclosure sale . Forty-two times Howard S. Abbott , Minneapolis master in chancery , solemnly offered the road for sale , heard no bids . But last year , while Abbott was sick abed , another master made the sale , and for some $2,000,000 the road 's reorganization managers , Coverdale &; Colpitts , transportation engineers , bought in its $79,000,000 of " assets . " Last week the directors met and approved the final legal technicalities . <P> Out of the Nowhere . On a balance-sheet basis , M. &; St. L. 's bondholders got mostly a $53.000,000 deficit ( the water logged stockholders were washed out com pletely ) . But for the future they got all the stock ( 150,000 shares ) in an almost debt-free road . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's receiver for eight years , as president . <P> White-haired , Illinois-born Railroader Sprague came up the hard way : callboy telegrapher , machinist 's apprentice , fireman , etc . After he had gone back to railroading , and had been promoted a few times , he picked up a new hobby : training race horses , particularly has-beens . Year after year his broken-down nags won purses for him ( one big grey won 16 out of 20 races , after Sprague bought him for $175 , pulled a tooth that had made him " outlaw " when the bit touched it ) .
