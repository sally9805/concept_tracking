Much information and an occasional twinge are provided the layman in the newly published History and Evolution of Surgical Instruments by Dr. C. J. S. Thompson ( Schumann 's ; $8.50 ) . Among many practical saws , knives and pincers illustrated therein , none is more interesting in a mechanical way than the 17th-Century triploides . This was not part of a torturer 's tool kit but , as the Latin inscription conveys , a surgeon 's device for raising a depressed fracture of the skull . <P> Many of the chief instruments of surgery were known and used at the time of Hippocrates , 400 B.C. , and some of them have changed little since . Some Roman scalpels would hardly look out of place on the instrument table of a modern operating theater . <P> To surgeons Dr. Thompson 's book is doubly important . It is the only available record of the great collection of surgical instruments at London 's Royal College of Surgeons . Shortly after Dr. Thompson had finished his book last spring , the collection was blitzed to smithereens .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
