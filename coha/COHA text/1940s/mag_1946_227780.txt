The most surprised men in the world this week were the seven members of the UNO committee to choose a site for the world capital . After 29 days of being wined , dined , high-pressured and deluged with mail by ambitious mayors and governors , they finally announced their choice - and discovered that the chosen community was aghast . <P> The committee wanted UNO to live just where a big chunk of New York City 's wealthier commuters already live - in 42 square miles of southwestern Connecticut and New York 's suburban Westchester County . Yugoslavia 's Dr. Stoyan Gavrilovic pointed out the area 's ad vantages . It was within easy commuting distance of Manhattan , where UNO dele gates would meet until the world capital was finished . It was close to railroads , the famed Merritt Parkway , the Westchester County Airport . The country was beautiful - green , rolling , dotted with fine houses , clubs , old towns . <P> Glowing with an enthusiasm which some 5,000 residents had discovered long before him , Dr. Gavrilovic described what was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small nation in itself . Big buildings would rise . There would be hotels , restaurants , shops , a railroad station . Thousands of tourists would flock to visit it . <P> But people who live in the 42 square miles shuddered at the mere thought . <P> One Drink or the Bottle ? County officials moaned that millions in taxes would be cut off forever . Said one : " It 's like asking a man to have a drink and watching him take the bottle . We thought UNO wanted about 300 acres . " Cried J. David Finger , operator of a flying school at Westchester Airport : " I got chased out of Floyd Bennett Field when the Navy took over . I got chased out of Idlewild when LaGuardia wanted it . If I get chased out of here I swear I 'll go to Mexico . " A dubious housewife , who guessed UNO would n't want her 100-year-old house , asked : " If I stay here could I keep on being an American citizen ? " <P> The uproar failed to disturb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club . " Nothing will happen to this club , " he predicted . " The members will be inviting those UNO fellows over to play golf and everything will be all right . " <P> Capital or Fair ? Residents of towns around the area could n't quite decide what to think about being neighbors with UNO . Snapped the Greenwich , Conn , assessor : " We 're going to be like living in the middle of the World 's Fair . " One Nick Trerotola , a garage owner , decided , somberly : " It may change my whole career . " A Republican politician named Harry J. Hunter looked at it from UNO 's point of view . " They 'll have to pay too much money . . . Westchester is the wealthiest county in the world . They 're not being economic . " <P> More than slightly baffled , the UNO committee set off for London to report their decision to the delegates of all nations . Their departure passed unnoticed by the citizens of Connecticut-Westchester , who were too busy arguing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and petitioning Congress , which must agree to give up sovereignty over the area before UNO can have it .
