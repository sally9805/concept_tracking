 | I am a selfish Mother Condensed from McCall 's As told to Helen Colton LAST YEAR when a piano teacher solicited pupils among the children of our neighborhood my friends urged me to let Via , my five-year-old daughter , take lessons . I told them our budget could afford inexpensive music lessons for one person in our family , but my daughter was n't going to take them ? I was . I explained that learning to play the piano meant nothing to Via 's happiness yet , but singing lessons meant a great deal to mine and a professional singer had offered me lessons at a price I could afford . If Via ever wants to learn to play the piano she will do so when she gets older and can make her own decision about it . Then she will cherish music all the more , because it will be her own idea . My neighbors were shocked by my attitude . I overheard one woman say , " Fay Jones is a selfish mother who deprives her child so she can take singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinary notions young mothers of my generation have about the obligations of motherhood . Most of us seem to believe that to be a good mother a woman must prostrate her life before her children , curtail her own cultural interests and make her own wardrobe and appearance second-best to those of her children . Too often the birth process which brings forth a new human being is also a burial service for the mother as an individual . When the first baby comes she ceases to have a personality of her own . She puts aside the once precious husband-wife relationship and replaces it with the mammapapa relationship . Her love affair with her husband is supplanted by one with her child ? not on the same emotional basis , to be sure , but just as time-consuming . It 's not surprising that in about a fourth of the country 's divorces the husband cornplains in court , " My wife cared more about our child than she did about me . " In this worship of the child we young mothers are breeding a generation of weaklings who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which they are no longer king . We  | are making our husbands the displaced persons of the American family . We are selling our appearances , personalities , intellects and marriages down the river all under the noble . guise of being good mothers . My friends do not share my feeling that it is more important to a mother 's morale , poise and sense of well-being to be well dressed than it is to her child 's . Children will be unhappy , of course , if their clothing is conspicuously different from that of their playmates , but they are much less concerned about clothes than grownups are . Accordingly , I do n't spend a lot of money on Via 's clothes , but 1 buy for her the most becoming colors I can find . Usually I take her shopping with me and offer her , for in stance , a choice of a blue or a pink dress . Via likes her clothes . tier human need to feel important is satisfied by making her own selection . When she starts to school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make her want to wear whatever the other kids are wearing . So I will sec to it that she has the same kind of clothes the rest of the gang wears , but not necessarily in the same degree . While there arc some things I wo n't give my child at the expense of my husband and myself , there are other things I give her gladly . Via wears utilitarian clothes but she also has the prettiest , frilliest party dress my lingers can concoct . She is n't taking music lessons , but we often sing and dance together so she can develop a sense of rhythm and music can become a part of her life . Getting my husband to back me up in toy attitude toward our daughter 's upbringing has not always been easy . At first his impulse was to do unto her as most other . parents do unto their children . If she screamed in a store for an expensive toy , he felt that he should get her that toy ? a cheaper substitute would not do . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we saw Johnny 's mother go out looking shabby it was he who said : " I feel sorry for Johnny 's father . If I were he I 'd feel better if my wife spent less on my kids and more on herself . L 'd want to he proud of the way she looks . " I 'm not pleading that mothers neglect their children so they can dress well and keep alive a perpetual flirtation with their husbands . But I do suggest that mothers should give at least as touch consideration and attention to themselves and their husbands as t hey give to their children . Last year I got a job as campaign manager for a Congressional candidate . I had to be away from home morning , noon . and night . I paid a next-door neighbor to take care of - Via during the day and to give her lunch . This meant that Via led the same existence as when I was home . She played with the same children , ate the same food , probably had the same feeling of security a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had some moments of insecurity , I am not sorry . As Dr. Karl bowman , psychiatry professor at the University  | of California Medical School , points out , " Occasional insecurity is necessary for a child to learn to live in an insecure , world , as he must when he grows My job broadened my horizons as a human being , as a citizen and as a mother . It took me way from my child for a while , but it gave her back a mother ho was more patient and compassionate . To my mind the parent who rods her intellectual needs completely satisfied in her companionship with her child is a bad mother . She is lazy , unwilling to cad and learn enough of what 's going on in the world so she can take part in discussions . I am keeping in touch with what 's going on around me , so that when Via breaks away from home with school activities , friends and interests 9f her own I will not feel that I 've given up the best years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to her happiness ? love , understanding , companionship , education ? but none of them so extravagantly and so obsessively that my husband and I are deprived of them . Since I want my Via to have a childhood without strain , a welladjusted adolescence and a mature womanhood independent of Mamma , I must have a life of my own independent of Via ? even if the world calls me a selfish mother .
