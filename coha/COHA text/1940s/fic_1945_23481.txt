SISTER MALONE AND THE OBSTINATE MAN A Story RUMER GODDEN S ISTER MALONE had an extraordinary capacity for faith . She was in charge of the Out-Patients ' in the Elizabeth Scott Memorial Hospital for Women and Children which was run by the Anglican Order to which she belonged . She needed her faith . Terrible things came under her hands . All sorts of patients came in all sorts of vehicles : rickshaws , curtained or uncurtained ; hired carriages that had shutters to close them into shut boxes ; a taxi with an accident case lying on the floor so that its blood should not soil the cushions  --  perhaps a case that the taxi itself had run over , it was astonishing how often taxis did run over patients ; a few patients came pillion on a bicycle ; some walked and some were carried . There were fathers carrying children , mothers carrying children , small children carrying smaller children ; there were whole families bringing one patient ; servants of the rich bringing their charges , bringing their mistress , bringing themselves ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birkas , white coverings like a tent that hid them from their heads to the ground ; there were hill women walking free ; there were beggar women ; high caste , low caste , untouchables ; all sorts of skins , dark , brown , pale ; all sorts of flesh , soft , pampered , thin , withered , sweet , ill-treated . There were diseased women , diseased children , burnt children , very very often burnt children ; very very often tubercular children . There was gonorrhea and syphilis , more and more gonorrhea and syphilis and more and more tuberculosis . There was a great deal of ophthalmia and rickets and scabies ; cases of leprosy and poisoning and fevers ; there were deep and dreadful tubercular abscesses on breasts and in groins , and armpits ; and there were broken bones made septic by neglect . There were bites from rabid dogs and sometimes bites from human beings , and like a chorus , always , burns and gonorrhea and tuberculosis . This was not the result of famine nor of war , this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of the hospitals in the city , an everyday sample of its pain and poverty and indifference and the misuse of its human beings . Sister Malone needed her faith , The Sisters who were detailed to help her always asked to be transferred after a few months . They became haunted and could not sleep . Sister Malone had worked there seven years . " But , Sister , I . . . you .. I . . I can not bear it , Sister . " " You must have faith , " said Sister Malone and she quoted as she had quoted a hundred hundred times , " And now abideth these three , faith , hope , and charity ' . " She paused . looking through the thick lenses of her glasses that had the effect of making her look a little blind . " God forgive me for differing , " said Sister Malone , " but you know dear , the greatest to me is faith . " A question , a little persistent question reared its head : was Sister Malone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no . Surely not . She was so splendid with the patients , but there was one small sign that nobody noticed : the patients called her " Didi , " " sister " ; she spoke of them as " they , " a race apart . " If only , " she said and she said this continually , " if only:they could have a little faith for them-selves ! " She tried to give it to them . In the corner of the treatment room there was a shelf on which lay little paper-covered gospels translated into Hindi and Ghurkali and Bengali and Urdu . Sister Malone gave one to every patient . She walked sincerely in what she believed to be the footsteps of Christ . " It is seeing so much eye trouble and lepers , " said Sister Malone , " that makes it so very vivid . Of course Our Lord knew that lepers are not nearly as infectious as is commonly thought . People are so mistaken about lepers , " said Sister Malone . " I have always thought it a pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known some quite clean lepers . Think of it , dear , " she said wistfully , " He put out his hand and touched them and made them whole . So quick , and here it is such a slow , slow business . But of course , " she said and sighed , " they need to have faith themselves for that . " Sister Malone herself was a small , firm , flat woman . Her hands probably knew more of actual India , had probed it deeper , than any politician 's brain . These implements  --  yes , implements , because the dictionary definition of implement is " whatever may fill up or supply a want " and that is a good description of Sister Malone 's hands  --  these implements were small and firm and flat too ; they needed to be firm . The backs of them were covered with freckles , the mark on Sister Malone of her years of Indian sun . She could not oftengo out into the sun herself , her day was heavily divided between hospital and chapel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she often , spoke about the sun to others . " Go and sit in the sun , " she told the patients . " God gave it to you for medicine and it is free . It is God 's medicine . " If they had asked , " Whose God ? " the answer would have been " Sister Malone 's . " EIGHT o'clock one blinding white morning in June , just before the break of the rains , Sister Malone , Sister Shelley , and Sister Latch walked into the treatment room . Over their white habits and black girdles and the ebony crucifixes on their breasts , they put on aprons ; the crosses showed through the bibs . They turned up their sleeves and went across to the sink where the tap ran perpetually , to scrub their hands , nails , wrists and forearms , then immersing them in a basin of water blue with bionide of mercury . " Remember , dear , " said Sister Malone to the young Sister Latch , " you scrub your hands between each patient and between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't let your hands touch your clothes . " Holding her own hands high in the air to dry , she turned to the instrument table . Sister Shelley and Sister Latch were helping in the treatment room that morning . Sister Shelley was pale , her face drawn and sensitive between the bands of her coif ; her eyes looked as if she had a headache . Sister Latch was newly out from home . Her steps were firm and certain , her pink face was made pinker by the heat , her body , well-fed , solid , was already sweating through her clothes . She was cheerful and observant and sensible and interested . It was her first morning in the Out-Patients ' department . Through the window as she scrubbed her hands , she noticed two little green parakeets tumbling in a gold-mohur tree . She would have liked to have drawn the other Sisters ' attention to them , but she did not . The Out-Patients ' was divided into the doctors ' rooms , the waiting hall , the dispensary , and the treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The patients waited in the waiting hall that was only furnished by pictures ; they sat in rows on ti floor . They went to the doctor in turn and then , with their tickets in their hands , were admitted to the dispensary for free medicine , and to the treatment room for dressings , examination , slight operations , or emergency treatment . " You let no one in without a ticket , " said Sister Malone to Sister Latch , " and you treat no one unless the ticket bears today 's date and the doctor 's signature . You can let the first two in . " . Sister Latch went eagerly to the door . There was already a crowd and they pressed round the door , a collection of dark faces , clothes and rags and nakedness and smells . Sister Latch held up two fingers and cried " Two " in her new Bengali , but seven edged past her into the room . " It 's all right , " said Sister Shelley in her even toneless voice . " There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced for permission at Sister Malone and set silently to work on the first . It was nothing , a septic ear ; it was a woman of the sweeper caste who sat herself down on a stool and , clasping her ankles so that she was bent almost double , inclined her head to her shoulder so that Sister Shelley could conveniently clean her ear . She had a baby across her knees and two little boys with swollen stomachs , wearing coats as short as boleros and nothing else , pressed behind her . The next two came and then another , an old woman . " You can attend to her , " said Sister Shelley to Sister Latch . " She is an old case and knows herself what to do . " Sister Malone was in the examination room with the doctor , Sister Shelley herself was dressing a burn on a child . Sister Latch went slowly up to the old woman . She was an old underdressed crone , wound in a meager gray-white cotton sari that showed her waist and breasts withered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare . She sat down on a stool and began to unwind a dirty , swollen-looking bandage on her thumb . " Do n't do that , " said Sister Latch . " Let me . " " Nahin , baba , " said the old woman unwinding steadily , " you can go and fetch the bowl for it to soak in . " Sister Latch looked round . " That is the bowl , " said the old woman pointing to a kidney dish on the table . " The hot water is there and there is the medicine . " She had come to the last of the bandage and she leaned her head back against the table and shut her eyes . " You can pull it off , " she said . " It makes me sick . " Sister Latch pulled and a tremor shook her that seemed to open a fissure , a crevasse in her from her knees to her stomach to her heart . The thumb was a stump , swollen , gangrened . It had a terrible smell . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ran to the back veranda . When she came back the thumb was soaking in an E.C . bath and Sister Shelley was preparing the dressing . " She is a maidservant in a rich house , " said Sister Shelley without emotion , " and they make her go on working , scouring cooking pots and washing with the thumb continually in water , and so of course it can not heal . " Sister Latch was dumb with sickness and pity and indignation . " It will never heal , " said Sister Shelley . At that moment Sister Malone came bustling back . " Ah , Tarala ! " she said to the old woman in Bengali . " Well , how 's your disgraceful thumb ? " She took it gently from the bath . " Ah , it 's better . " She examined it . " It is better . It actually is . Look , Sister , do you see how it 's beginning to slough off here ? Is n't that wonderful ? Sister , give me the scissors . " Tarala @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We must cut a little here and here . Hold her shoulders , dear . That 's right . Give her a little support . Hush now , Tarala . You want the use of your hand back , do n't you ? There now , it 's done . Now the dressing , Sister , quickly . " Her fingers wound on the bandage swiftly and steadily . She finished and lifted the hand and put it in the bosom of the sari . " There , that 's beautiful , " she said and the old woman crept out , still seared with pain , but obscurely comforted . " But how can it heal ? " asked Sister Latch with tears in her sympathetic eyes . " What is the use ? " " We must hope for the best , " said Sister Malone . Sister Shelley was silent . " We must temper our work with faith , " said Sister Malone . Through being steeped in ritual and reality Sister Malone 's words were often accidentally beautiful . " We must have faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this child is for operation . " She put a piece of brown paper under the child 's feet as he lay on the table . He began to scream as Sister Shelley cleaned his forehead with spirit . Sister Malone lingered a moment , looking at Sister Shelley 's face as she bent above the little boy . He had an abscess on his forehead ; he was a dark little boy and the skin round the abscess was stretched and strained with colors of olive green and fig purple . His eyes rolled to show the whites with fright , the charm he wore round his neck rode up and down and the muscles of his stomach were drawn in and tensed into the shape of a cave under his ribs . He screamed continually in short shrill screams like a pipe . The doctor came out of his room . Suddenly Sister Shelley began to scream as well . She was holding the boy 's hands out of the way while she cleaned him and now she beat them on the table . " Stop that ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Stop ! Stop that noise ! " Sister Malone knocked her hands away and spun her round by the shoulders and marched her outside and came in quickly and shut the doors . " Take her place , Sister , " she said curtly . " The doctor 's here . Orderly ! " she called . " Come . Hold his feet . " And to Sister Latch , " Be strong . " " But  --  no anaesthetic ? " asked Sister Latch . " There 's no money for anaesthetics for a small thing like this , " said Sister Malone sadly . " Never mind , " she added firmly , " he 'll be better soon . It is over in a minute . " Sister Latch , more sick than ever , held her place , her hand each side of the child 's head . Sister Malone took his arms and folded them on his chest and leaned the weight of her arm on them . The orderly pinned his feet as the doctor came in . Sister Latch trembled but she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole affair . The doctor took his knife from the bowl put ready and at the same moment Sister Malone covered the child 's eyes with her hand . A cry rang to the ceiling . In a moment the doctor was gone . " Qu  --  ick , " quavered Sister Latch . " Yes , " said Sister Malone swabbing and dabbing . " Give him a sweetie , Sister , " and she nodded to a glass jar of sweets on the cupboard . The little boy stopped crying as if a switch had been closed . Into the sudden quiet came other sobbing from outside . " Sister  --  Shelley ? " " I 'm afraid so , " said Sister Malone . " She 's maybe not strong enough for this . " Pr i-tE morning went on growing steadily hotter , the smells steadily stronger , the light more blind and white . The heat in the treatment room was intense and both Sisters were wet , their hands clammy . In half an hour Sister Shelley , made curiously empty and blank by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malone said nothing . The patients came until Sister Latch lost count of them , and the wounds and the sores and disease and shame were shown and the room echoed with cries and screams and there were endless tears . " Rivers of tears , " thought Sister Latch and she remembered in her tired confusion that she had learned that India was a land of large unstemmed rivers . She looked up and out of the window . The parakeets were still there in the bright air . Then in the middle of the hubbub , quiet descended . A car drove up , a large car , and from it two young men jumped down calling for a stretcher . They were two well-dressed young Hindus in white and between them they lifted from the car something small and fragile and very still wrapped in vivid violet and green . Sister Latch saw a fall of long black hair . The stretcher was brought straight into the treatment room and the girl was lifted from it to the table . She lay inert , with the brilliant colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought Sister Latch watching Sister Malone 's fingers on her pulse , " she had not finished dressing or the sari had fallen away . " Her face was a pale oval turned up to the ceiling , her mouth pale , her nostrils wide as if they were stamped with fright , and her eyes were open , glazed , the pupils enormous , her hair hung to the floor . Shc was very young . " Perhaps seventeen ? " said Sister Latch aloud . " Sixteen ? How beautiful she is . She is dead . " " She is breathing , " said Sister Malone with her flat little hand spread on the girl 's breast . One of the young men was terribly unnerved . Sister Latch wondered if he were the husband . He shivered and shivered as he stood by the table ; his lips shivered and the thin folds of his fine spotless shirt . " She t-took her own I-life , " he said involuntarily . The other man , darker , stronger , said sternly , " Bc quiet . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gaze , blinded by the lenses of her glasses , turned towards him . " She t-took her own life . " " And why ? Why ? " said Sister Maione 's glasses but her lips said evenly , " Well , she did n't succeed . She is breath-ing . " " You th-think , th-there is  --  hope ? " " There is always hope , " said Sister Malone , " while there is breath . " Then the doctor and orderlies came in with pails and the stomach pump and the young men were sent out of the room . Sister Shelley went to the window and stood there with her back to everyone and Sister Malone , after a glance at her , let her stand . " You will have to help me , " said Sister Malone to Sister Latch . " Be strong . " " But  --  only tell me what it 's about ? I do n't understand . I do n't understand , " cried Sister Latch . " She has poisoned herself , " said Sister Malone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But why ? " cried Sister Latch again . " Why ? She is so young . So beautiful . Why should she ? " " It  --  is best not to be too curious , " said Sister Malone . " No , " said Sister Shelley suddenly with her back to them . " Do n't ask . Do n't understand . Only try and drag her back ? for more . " The doctor was busy with the pump . Sister Malone and Sister Latch were covering the gauze and chiffon with hospital blankets and began to rub the limbs . Sister Latch noticed the foot of the leg she was holding ; the nails were perfect little half moons painted with crimson and the heel was stained with red ; it was a little , jewelled , gaudy foot , ice cold . The permanganate water flowed lifelessly from the tube into the pail . " There 's no reflex , " said the doctor . All the heat in the world seemed to be in Sister Latch as she rubbed , but none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her bands stuck to her face and neck , her habit stuck to her back , and her hands oozed out on the powder that Sister Malone kept passing her . There was a sudden gurgle , a bubbling in the tube and the eyelids made an almost imperceptible little motion like a twitch . " There now , " said Sister Malone . " Rub harder , dear . Rub harder . Harder . " A few minutes later the doctor paused , waited , bent , waited another minute ; stood up and slowly , still carefully , began to withdraw the tube . " No ? " said Sister Malone , her hands still on the other leg and thigh under the blankets , her face glistening , her glasses blurred . " No ! " " Yes , " said the doctor and the last of the hideous tube came from the girl 's mouth . A little pink water ran down her chin , staining the sheet . He wiped it and gently closed her mouth and drew down her lids , but the mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0 that looked childish and dismayed , inadequate to the sternness of the oval of the face and sealed lids . " Snuffed out , " said Sister Malone as she stood up and gently put the draperies back and looked down on the girl 's shut face . " They have nothing to sustain them , " said Sister Malone . " Nothing at all . " " A case for the police , " said the doctor . " We shall have to give our statements . " Sister Latch began to cry quietly . The young men came in and carried the girl away and , from the window , Sister Shelley and Sister Latch saw the car drive away with a last sight of violet and green on the back seat . A tear slid down Sister Latch 's cheek . " Forgive me , " said Sister Latch but no one answered ; her tears slid unnoticed into that great river . " Forgive me , " said Sister Latch , " she wore  --  exactly the same green  --  as those little parrots . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in stone , Sister Malone was tidying up the room for the next patients . " Nothing to sustain them , " said Sister Malone and sighed . " Nothing at all . " T THE very end of the morning , when they had finished and taken off their aprons , an old man came into the waiting hall from the doctor 's room . He moved very slowly and led a small girl by the hand ; he held his ticket uncertainly between his finger and thumb as if he did not know what he had to do with it . He was a very emaciated old man . " Another , " said Sister Shelley . " Oh no ! It 's too late . " " No , " said Sister Malone with her faithful exactness . " It 's one minute to , " and she took the paper . " it 's nothing , " she said , " only stitches to be taken out of a cut on the child 's lip . I remember her now . You may go , Sisters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung up their aprons thankfully and went . Sister Shelley 's head was bent with resolution as she quickened her steps ; Sister Latch followed , stumbling a little ; she was terribly tired and her face was not pink any more but flamingly red and her whole body was wet through . Sister Malone was left alone with the man and the child . As she lifted the scissors out with the forceps she caught his gaze fixed on her and she saw that he was not old , only emaciated until his flesh had sunken in . His skin was a curious , dead , gray-brown . " You are ill , " said Sister Malone . " I am ill , " said the man and his voice was calm . Sister Malone turned the little girl to the light . The child began to whimper and the man to plead with her in a voice quite different from the one he had used when he had spoken of himself . He trembled with the effort as the soft Bengali words cameout , " She will not hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course I will not hurt you if you stand still , " said Sister Malone . " See , if you hold her shoulders you can keep her still . " The man and the child stood breathlessly still while Sister Malone quickly nicked the stitches in the healed cut , and with her forceps drew out the two tiny threads . The child gave two small cries but she did not move , only the tears ran out of her eyes and the sweat ran off the man . When it was over and he could release his hands , he staggered . Sister Malone thought lie would have fallen if she had not caught him and helped him to a stool . His arm in her hand was burning hot . " You have fever , " said Sister Malone . " I continually have fever , " said the man . " What is it you have ? " asked Sister Malone . " What illness ? " " God knows , " he answered , but as if he were satisfied not wondering . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Not know ? But you are very ill . Have n't you seen the doctor ? " " No . " " Then you must come with me at once , " said Sister Malone energetically . " I will take you to the doctor . " " Thank you , no . " " But you must see a doctor . " " I do not need a doctor . " " But  --  how can we know what to do for you ? How can you know ? " " I do not need to know . " " But you should have medicine . . treatment . " He smiled . " I have my medicine . " His smile was so peculiarly calm that it made Sister Malone pause . She looked at him silently , searchingly . He smiled again and opened the front of his shirt and showed her where , round his neck , hung a silver charm on a red thread of the sort she saw every day and all day long round the necks of men and women and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his eyes . " My medicine , " he said . " God . " Sister Malone suddenly flushed . " That 's absurd , " she said . " You will die . " " If I die , I am happy . " " But , man ! " cried Sister Malone , " you mean you will give yourself up without a struggle ? " " Why should I struggle ? " " Come with me to the doctor . " " No . " " That 's sheer senseless obstinacy , " cried poor Sister Malone . " If you wo n't come to him , let me fetch him to you . " " No . " " Obstinate ! Obstinate ! " Her eyes behind her glasses looked bewildered and more than ever blind . Then they fell on the child . " You came for her , " she said , " then why not for yourself ? " " She is too young to choose her path . I have chosen . " There was a silence . " Come , Joya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sahib and we shall go . " " Wait . Wait one minute . If you wo n't listen to me let the doctor talk to you . He is a wise good man . . . . Let him talk . . . " She had barred his way and he seemed to grow more dignified and a little stern . " Let me go , " he said . " I have told you . I need nothing . I have everything . I have God . " ISTE R M A LONE was furious as she washed her hands . Her face was red . Her glasses glittered . " Mumbo-jumbo ! " she said furiously as she turned the tap off . " Mumbo-jumbo ! Heavens ! What an obstinate man !
