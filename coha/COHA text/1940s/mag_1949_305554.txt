Not long ago Dr. Mont Follick , Labor member for Loughborough , interested his fellow M.P.s by demonstrating from the floor of the House a rotating toothbrush of his own invention . Last week Dr. Follick nearly won a victory for another invention , a system of simplified spelling . <P> The son of a Cardiff draper , Dr. Follick was born in Wales where every schoolboy is expected to learn the spelling of such names as **59;13040;TOOLONG . At 17 , he left Wales for Australia . Perhaps Down Under he heard about the New Zealand hilltop called **58;13101;TOOLONG . He developed an English alphabet containing no C , Q or X. <P> Last week for nearly five hours the House of Commons debated the pros &; cons of his bill to make simplified spelling compulsory in all British schools , films and copyrighted literature . No foreigner , the bill provided , would be naturalized until he had mastered the new spelling . " Fourteen million schoolchildren , " pleaded Dr. Follick , " are wasting their time over the old spelling . " ( One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " hear , hear ! " ) A simpler English comprehensible to foreigners , he went on , would be of inestimable value to international relations . Tory M.P . Christopher Hollis made a shrewd comment on this motion . Said Hollis : " I do not think we should like Mr. Molotov any better if we understood everything he said . " <P> Tory M.P . and Punch Editor Sir Alan ( A. P. ) Herbert wanted to know how Follick 's phonetics would cope with the word water . " I think , " said Herbert , " the Hon. Member for Loughborough proposes to spell it ' uoorter . ' Some cockneys leave out the T and call it ' wa'er . ' Americans say ' watter , ' but how do the Scotsmen say it ? " Glasgow 's John Rankin volunteered : " We pronounce it whuskey . " <P> When the final vote was taken , the bill was defeated by a narrow margin of 87 to 84 . " It 's a great moral victory , " said Dr. Follick . " We shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Daily Express , " ar welcum to Docter Folics nu Inglish . WE PREFER IT AS IT IS . " But the Evening Standard felt constrained to point out that " spelling reform is supported by many of the leading intelligence of the country . " One of these , of course , was G. B. Shaw , who long ago had pointed out that under the present system the word " fish " might just as well be spelled GHOTI ; GH as in enough , O as in women , TI as in nation . GH-O-TI = fish .
