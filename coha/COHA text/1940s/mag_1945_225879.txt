WESTERN WORDS - Ramon F. Adams - Universify of Oklahoma Press ( $3 ) . <P> When an oldtime cowboy wanted to tell how drunk he had been , he said he was so drunk he could n't hit the ground with his hat in three throws . The cowboy liked his coffee strong . If a horseshoe would sink in it , he said , it was n't ready . He called all coffee Arbuckle , after the brand commonly used on the range . <P> Western Words is a dictionary of 3,000 expressions , many still current , " of the range , cowcamp and trail . " It begins with ace in the hole , meaning either a shoulder holster or a hideout , and it ends with zorrillas , cattle of the early longhorn breed . <P> One of the liveliest and most informal dictionaries since Dr. Johnson 's , it is also one of the easiest to read . It gives a vivid characterization of cowboys and their life . <P> The oldtime cowboy was extremely ceremonious and intensely democratic . In the presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal . He referred contemptuously to fistfights as dogfights . Oldtimers in the cattle country were said to be alkalied when " they knowed all the lizards by their first names , except the younger set . " A young fellow , or a small man , was said to be fryin ' size . When the cowboy got drunk he liked to have everyone know it - he said he cut his wolf loose . Once four young cowpunchers rode their horses into a New Mexico saloon where an Eastern drummer was having a drink . When the drummer complained to the bartender that the horses jostled him , the bartender snorted , " What the hell y'u doin ' in here afoot , anyhow ? " When two friendly riders met on the trail , they stopped and sooner or later swung off their horses , squatted on their bootheels , began scratching in the dirt with broomweed stalks . " A cowhand kin jes ' talk better when he 's a-scratchin ' in the sand like a hen in a dung heap . " This was known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . <P> Westerners carried five beans in the wheel - five cartridges in their guns . Some - mighty unpopular - " were so tough they 'd growed horns and was haired over . " Their gun battles were called corpse and cartridge occasions ' , the aftermath " looked like beef day at an Injun agency . " A bad man was a curly wolf , a bandido , cat-eyed , or just a plain killer . Sometimes a curly wolf could stay on the dodge , among the willows , or lookin ' over his shoulder for quite a spell . But once caught , his fate was sealed . With a rope around his neck he was hung up to dry , or exalted .
