FO'CASTLE WALTZ-Louis Slobodkin-Vanguard ( $2.75 ) . <P> In the doldrum days between World Wars I &; II , Louis Slobodkin , then a broth of a boy , now a ranking U.S. sculptor , decided to ship as a deckhand on the tramp freighter S.S. Hermanita , plying between the Port of New York and Latin America . Fo'castle Waltz is his 352-page total recall of this nautical episode . <P> Soon Sailor Slobodkin ( self-described as " a fat , soft guy with glasses " ) found himself loading cargo , eating slop and doing soogie moogie ( scrubbing paint work ) with a crew as oddly assorted as flotsam &; jetsam on a beach . There was a union-conscious Portuguese named Perry . " His cross eyes seemed to set the motive for all his movement-when he 'd sit down , he 'd cross his legs , cross his arms . . . . I never saw him standing with his legs straight . . . . " <P> There were a couple of seagoing prep-school boys , Al , an amateur boxer whose short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was unpleasantly popeyed . There was Georgia Boy , a snake-hipped harmonica player and dancer , who used to talk nostalgically about his " mammy . " And there was Joe , whose father was a Yorkshireman , whose mother was a French Tahitian and whose English was a splendid massacre . Joe once referred to the " United Steaks Conscience , Washington , Disease " which , translated , turned out to be the United States Congress , Washington , D.C. Sometimes he would dream about his abandoned South Sea Eden : " No , sir , dere 's no snakes , no sharks , nevaire ' ot , nevaire col ' . . . . You do n't have to work on de Island- jist pick fruit off de tree . . . . Same when you 're hungry for girl . . . . She 's laugh and go wit you . . . . An ' all de girls . . . is vierge virginal-all de time . " <P> The highlights of Fo'castle Waltz ( some of them are quite high ) are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Argentine port , the perilous voyage back to the U.S. ( which the rickety S.S. Hermanita made in ballast with the pumps choked and the lifeboats rusted to the davits ) , and Author Slobodkin 's one-man mutiny when he was fed up with cleaning sewage from the bilges . <P> Author Slobodkin has an artist 's eye for significant detail and the kind of gossipy fluency that makes many women 's letters easy reading . He has also managed to smuggle into print ( suitably disguised ) a verb seldom seen in polite English prose since Lady Chatterley 's Lover . In fact , Slobodkin has assimilated himself so completely to the somewhat rancid life of his crewmates that some readers may feel that they have listened to a five-hour monologue by a seafaring stablehand.
