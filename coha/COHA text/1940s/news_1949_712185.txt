txt The United States , Canada and Britain , the three principal countries concerned in the sterling area 's dollar crisis , reaffirmed today their faith in the possibility of achieving " a single multilatepal system " of trade in which dollar and non-dollar countries could operate together . The three-power talks on the crisis were concluded formally this afternoon at a luncheon given by Prime Minister Attlee at Chequers , his country home , for John Snyder , United States Secretary of the Treasury ; Douglas Abbott , Canadian Finance Minister ; and Sir Stafford Cripps , British Chancellor of the Exchequer . The luncheon was mainly a social affair , for the communique on the talks , which was issued afterward , had been written during Saturday 's meetings and was not changed in any important detail . The statement emphasized " the profound and long-term character " of existing problems . The communiqu ? conspicuously failed , however , to suggest any new plan or proposals for tackling the problems or ' establishing a system in which dollars and sterling could meet as equals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries for the future pattern of world trade . Snyder Calls Talks " Useful " Before leaving by air for Brussels , Mr. Snyder told reporters he thought the conference had served " a useful purpose " but he would not elaborate on this . With the United States Congress possibly in Mind , the three Ministers wrote into the communiqu ? that Britain , as well as Canada and the United States , shared the view that " remedies other than financial assistance such as that provided by the United States and Canada must be explored . " The next step in efforts of the three countries to find a long-term solution for the sterling area 's difficulties , the communiqu ? said , will be technical and fact-finding discussions between the three Governments . These will lay the groundwork for further ministerial talks , which , it was hoped , will be held in Washington early in September . During the two-day talks , there was what the communiqu ? described as a " comprehensive " examination of the factors that had brought about the recent acceleration in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British Chancellor and his experts outlined the steps already taken , such as the suspension of new purchasing in the dollar area . New Steps to Be Weighed Emphasizing Mr. Snyder 's views that the immediate crisis must be solved by British efforts , the communiqu ? said it was agreed that the number of supplementary measures suggested to strengthen the present position should be " the subject of further consideration . " In this connection , it was added that there was no suggestion that sterling be devalued . The communiqu ? said the threepower talks had reaffirmed the objective of the three Governments ' economic policies to be those set out in the articles of agreement of the International Monetary Fund and the Havana Charter for an International Trade Organization . The trade organization has not yet come into existence . The Communiqu ? added that particular stress was laid on finding solutions to maintain high levels of employment and to enable world trade and international payments to develop on a multilateral basis . All these are part of the aims of the Monetary Fund along with the promotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among members . Everybody concerned , the communiqu ? said , must be prepared to review their policies with the goal of the establishment of a single multilateral system . In connection with the state- ment on no devaluation of sterling it was noted here that the original Bretton Woods agreement on ' the Monetary Fund provided that currency par values were not to be altered except whore fundamental disproportion existed in the balance of payments . The technical language of the communiqu ? , much the same as that in which all Government pronouncements on the crisis have been couched , is not going to help the average Briton realize the gravity of the situation . He understands the strikes , and in . any discussion of British troubles to . day he will make a point of condemning the present work stoppages . But the dollar crisis is unreal for most of the people . It is remote because jobs are plentiful , wages are good and retail sales are higher than at any time since 1938.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
