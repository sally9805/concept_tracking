The Emperor of Japan is not a man . He is 39 years old , has six human children , weighs about 135 pounds , eats , sleeps and fans himself ; but he is not a man . Hirohito , Son of the Sun Goddess , is a lot of things . He is fierce samurai battles , snowcapped volcanoes , the flowering mimosa , fat carp in mountain pools . He is exaggerated politeness , intense ambition , orchidaceous sensitivity . He is the rising sun . He is also a big navy , and a crying need for cheap rice and living space . He embraces Japan . He is Japan . <P> Last week Japanese reverently celebrated the 2,600th anniversary of the assumption of divine rule by Hirohito 's ancestor Jimmu , first of Japan 's unbroken ( but , thanks to some perfectly divine concubines , occasionally knotted ) string of 124 emperors . To Occidentals , the celebration looked like so much hocuspocus . This scoffing attitude was symptomatic of the blind misunderstanding of Japan 's ways which last week threatened-in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's troubles-to get the U. S. into war . <P> U. S. citizens have misunderstood every step in the downward path of U. S.-Japanese relations . They thought the Nine-Power Treaty of 1922 was designed to maintain the integrity of China ; whereas to the Japanese it was merely " a gangsters ' agreement to divide China 's spoils . " They thought Japan invaded Manchuria in 1931 ; whereas Japan merely " established Manchukuo " in defense of her own rights . They certainly failed to realize the real reason for the China Incident which began in 1937 : Japan 's solicitude for a fellow race being plundered by alien powers . But the worst mistake the U. S. made was to think that by penalizing Japan ( by abrogating her trade treaty-TIME , Feb. 5 et seq. ) she could change Japan 's silky beliefs and stubborn course . <P> Japanese statesmen arose in the Tokyo Diet last week to insist that nothing would change that course . If the U. S. implemented the treatyless situation with an embargo , Japan would not sit there and take it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter ) ; or stop being the U. S. 's third best customer ; or throw U. S. citizens out of China ; or fight . <P> In Washington there were three schools of thought on the Far Eastern situation : 1 ) Messrs . Pittman , Schwellenbach , Izac , Coffee , Fish , et al. - proponents of an embargo against Japan ; 2 ) a growing group , underwritten by Secretary Morgenthau and the Export-Import Bank , which favored the roundabout maneuver of giving China a $20,000,000 credit ( China had asked for $75,000,000 ) ; and 3 ) a sudden cloud of alarmists , frightened mainly by Columnist Walter Lippmann , who thought the risk of war was growing by the minute , but that the U. S. should hopefully do nothing . <P> Last week the U. S. State Department apparently favored doing nothing about Japan . But it looked as if this might be the surest way of all to bring on war . Having threatened action , a sudden backing down would give the Japanese the impression that the U. S. dares not fight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. insults and misunderstandings -a few more arrogant U. S. cheeks slapping Japanese sentries ' palms , a few more compounds impudently getting in the way of Japanese bombs-might mean that Japanese battleships as well as beetles would plague the U. S.
