For the Democrats , in the gloomy summer of 1948 , money was hard to come by . Even tried &; true contributors of other years were reluctant to bet on what seemed to be a sure loser . Then Louis Johnson stepped in , raised enough money ( $1,500,000 ) to pay for Harry Truman 's whistle-stop campaign . Some of the men on whom Johnson put the bite were longtime Democrats ; some were strong for one plank or another in Harry Truman 's platform ; some simply found it good business to be on good terms with the Administration ( as others were supporting the G.O.P. for the same reason ) . Whatever their motives , Harry Truman-who puts great store by such things-has reason to be specially grateful to the following : <P> Nathan Lichtblau , 45 , Manhattan plastics manufacturer who also owns interests in Palm Beach real estate . A perennial assistant to Democratic treasurers since 1936 , Lichtblau served as Johnson 's deputy , wheedled many a sweat-stained dollar from New York 's minority groups when the going was tough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launched in the campaign 's closing days . Says Lichtblau : " I do n't want a job or anything . I work purely as an amateur . " <P> Floyd B. Odium , 57 , slim , publicity-shy president of the octopoidal Atlas Corp. , a Wall Street investment company . One of the nation 's most spectacular financiers ( e.g. , RKO , Greyhound Lines ) , Odium has made a specialty of buying up control of companies , putting them in good running condition , then selling out at a handsome profit . A recent buy ( 1947 ) : Consolidated Vultee ( he is board chairman ) . Other Atlas interests : United Fruit , American &; Foreign Power ( a subsidiary of Electric Bond &; Share ) . A longtime Democratic angel , Odium was at first none too wild about Harry , but stoutly supported him . He gave $3,000 himself , got his associates to add $20,000 more . <P> Tom Evans , longtime Kansas City personal and political friend of Harry Truman . Tall , white-haired Tom Evans lent Truman $5,000 to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $3,000 himself , raised $100,000 more in the Midwest . He owns Kansas City 's station KCMO , is board chairman of Crown Drug Co. , a chain with 85 stores in Missouri , Kansas and Oklahoma . <P> Albert M. Greenfield , onetime Republican and heavy contributor to the Vare machine , who switched allegiance in 1932 . Born in the Ukraine in 1887 , Greenfield is one of the biggest real-estate operators in the country , controls banks , department stores , a candy store chain ( Loft ) , theaters and several of Philadelphia 's big hotels . He is active in both Christian and Jewish charities , a prime promoter of National Brotherhood Week . He was vice chairman of Johnson 's fund-raising committee . During the campaign , he got an SOS : funds were so low that the Democrats could broadcast only 15 minutes of an important Truman speech . Greenfield wired back : buy the air time , and make it half an hour . When Truman rode through the streets of Philadelphia , short , chubby Albert Greenfield rode with him .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
