In February 1916 , in the second year of World War I , the German Army launched its attack on the fortress of Verdun . Although forced to yield ground , 59-year-old General Henri Philippe Ptain held Verdun and the German drive collapsed . Last week Germany found Marshal Ptain , now 84 , the same stubborn tactician . <P> There were vast differences between Verdun of 1916 and Vichy of 1941 . Behind Verdun was an Allied Army of hundreds of thousands ; behind Vichy is an ill-supplied North African Army and a badly damaged French Fleet . The France of 1916 could draw on the resources of the British Empire ; the France of 1941 is , officially , not even friends with Great Britain . France of 1916 was fighting for dominance of Europe ; 1941 France is fighting for its life as a nation . <P> But Henri Philippe Ptain stood in the same position : squarely in the path of Germany 's ambition . When Super-Politician Adolf Hitler dictated his-armistice terms to a shattered France last June he undoubtedly planned to proceed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A shrewd conqueror will always enforce his exactions on the conquered only by stages . Then he may expect that a people who have lost all strength of character will not find in any of these acts of oppression . . . sufficient grounds for taking up arms again . " This time , however , Adolf Hitler found at the head of the conquered nation , not a politician of the sort he had been used to dealing with , but a soldier . <P> And that soldier was determined to recreate in his people precisely the thing Hitler was determined to break down : strength of character . In eight months the Marshal has achieved a good deal of success . His people see him as the personification of patriarchical strength of character . The Church , both Catholic and Protestant , supports him for his endorsement of religion . And last week Chief of State Henri Philippe Ptain felt strong enough to stand against the Germans again as he had done 25 years ago at Verdun . <P> Strategic Retreat . The crisis in Franco-German relations had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Marshal dismissed Pierre Laval-a politician of the sort that Adolf Hitler can deal with . The Marshal 's trusted aide , Admiral Jean Darlan , was in Paris conferring with Laval and with Hitler 's Ambassador , Otto Abetz . Admiral Darlan was empowered to offer Laval reinstatement in the Government on an equal footing with himself and War Minister General Charles Huntziger , the Marshal retaining supreme authority . That was the Marshal 's strategic withdrawal to positions he had previously prepared . <P> Laval wanted more . As on the night of his dismissal , he demanded authority for himself , with the Marshal as a figurehead . To back up his demand he offered tempting concessions on the part of the German conqueror . More war prisoners would be released . The cost of occupation would be reduced from $8,000,000 to $3,600,000 a day . The boundaries of unoccupied France might be extended , possibly to include Paris . Admiral Darlan took a train back to Vichy , half won over to Laval 's cause .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
