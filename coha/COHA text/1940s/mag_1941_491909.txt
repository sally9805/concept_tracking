15 , M OST people think of the long rifle that Daniel Boone carried through the wilderness of the Ohio Valley as something to hang over the mantelpiece as a relic of a day that is gone . In the country that Daniel Boone explored more than 100 years ago they think of the long rifle as something to be used . They are nearer than the rest of us to the tradition . They know how necessary the rifle was to Boone and the men who followed him . How could Boone have done what he did if he had carried an English Brown Bess , with its smooth bore , its heavy bullets , and its inability to hit whet it was aimed at , instead of the instrument of precision he had ? He lived by the rifle . He could n't have lived by a blunderbuss . In Ohio and Indiana , in Kentucky and Tennessee , they have revived the art of loading and shooting muzzle-loading rifles . Not that it ever died . There never was a time since Daniel Boone when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States shot with muzzle-loading rifles , often for the five choices of a beef . The live choices were the two hindquarters , the two forequarters , the hide and tallow . In the Great Smokies , where you ride a horse up the branch because there is no better road than the creek bed , there is a sixth choice . That is the privilege of cutting out the wood of the tree in which the bullets have buried themselves and recovering the lead , which is quoted at five and a half cents a pound on the New York commodities market , but is often more useful than silver or gold in the mountains . Ten years ago , a club in Portsmouth , Ohio , led by a Y. M. C. A. secretary named E , M. Farris , sent out an invitation to a muzzleloading-rifle match . They liked the old guns and they wanted to shoot them and find out how good they were . Over in Indiana , Boss Johnston , who broadcasts on hunting and fishing , got into a chance match with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went on the air he told his audience about the match . He was astonished at the number of letters he got . So was Powel Crosley , Jr ? the owner of the station . Mr. Crosley offered a cup for a muzzle-loading match open to all corners . Neither Mr. Farris in Ohio nor Mr. Johnston in Indiana guessed that presently men who had been shooting modern guns would be getting grandfather 's rifle out of the attic and that others would be hunting the country for muzzle-loading rifles in shooting condition and that gunsmith/3 would be called on to make new muzzle-loading rifles to satisfy a growing demand . Since then everybody who in interested in rifle shooting has heard about the muzzle-loading matches in the Middle West and , more lately , in Connecticut and California . I have shot muzzle-loading ritles made by Harry Pope in offhand matches at 200 yards when there was no restriction on the kind of rifle used , because nothing else quite so good for this special kind of shooting has ever been made . I load the bullet from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But my Pope muzzle-loaders are built on breech-loading actions and can be shot as breech-loaders . They are not what the muzzle-loading fans mean by a muzzle-loader and they are not permitted in muzzle-loading matches , which require either a flintlock or a percussion lock , and a patched bullet . I knew nothing about such guns except what 1 had read and heard . So I was happy to be asked to go out and see the annual matches of the WLW National Muzzle-Loading Continued an Page 351 ( Continued from Page 15 ) Rifle Association at Friendship , Indiana , and to meet Ivan Dmitri , the photographer , there . I knew that I would have a grand time watching the work of rifles I have wanted to know more about and talking guns to men I have wanted to meet . I did feel that Mr. Dmitri was out of luck . What could he find to photograph at a rifle match ? Rifle matches are as hotly fought as any other kind of contest . But in the nature of the case , rifle shooters make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk when they are in a match . They do n't want to laugh or hear anybody else laugh . If they have any walking to do , they walk slowly . They do n't want to raise their heartbeats . They know that one mistake  --  one bad shot -- -will make all the difference between a good score and a poor . one . Their sport requires its own special kind of nerve , the nerve to wait under pressure , to resist the natural human impulse to snatch at the trigger as the sights swing fast across the bull , to hold until the gun steadies , slows down , edges toward the center , and then , promptly but without haste , to put the last necessary quarter-ounce pressure on that trigger . When everything is going well , the gun seems to fire itself . But it wo n't do that for a man who is excited , or even for one who hi trying too hard . What is there for spectators in watching competitors who get quieter and quieter as the going gets tough ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting a world 's record score , that he was having the time of his life . You 'd think he was bored . You ca n't see what is happening down there at the target . The competitors take quick looks through their spotting scopes at rival targets , but they often do n't know for sure who won until the next day , after the officials have spent half the night judging doubtful shots and checking and rechecking scores . J. F. Cooper 's Error Mr. Dmitri and I found ourselves , of an Indian-Bummer day , in a forty-acre field with an American flag on a pole in the middle . To the south was parking space for several hundred cars , a tent for the officials , and a long awning protecting the oil stoves at which the ladies of the Baptist Church of Friendship were making coffee and the tables where they were getting ready to serve sandwiches . Under the flag was a loud-speaker mounted on a truck . In front of us was a single wire that divided the spectators from the competitors for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long loading benches for general use and smaller individual benches , made to fold like an ironing board , so they could be carried in a car or on the front bumper . One of them was an ironing board . They were used by shooters in what were called prone matches , but which permit the choice of sitting at a bench rest or lying an the ground with the rifle barrel ! supported on a stake or on some special contraption . Close at hand we saw men loading flintlock rifles , some of them heirlooms and some of them fresh from the rifling machine . To the left , 100 yards away , we saw forty-rod guns in action . One of them weighed forty-two pounds and shot 130 grains of powder behind a slug of nearly two ounces ? more powder and lead than the biggest of the Sharps buffalo guns . As I watched , the gun leaped off the rest , the man behind it rose in the air as if he had been lifted off his camp stool by a giant hand , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust jumped out of the dry hillside and went down the wind . There is never any swank about a rifle match . There was no swank here . It was all as American as a church sociable , or the Fourth of July , or a horseshoe-pitching contest , and reminded me of all three . Some of the shooters were farmers , and some were mechanics , and some were doctors , and some were businessmen , and some were lawyers , and some were white-haired old ladies with pink cheeks . But blue-denim overalls were more common than slacks , and if there was a tweed jacket , I missed it . I was watching something / had never seen before  --  the loading of a flintlock rifle ? when Dmitri nudged me . " This , " he said , " has everything . " So I quit worrying about what he would photograph and watched the man with the Kentucky rifle . It is a highly specialized kind of gun with what , to eyes accustomed to the lines of modern rifles , seems an exceedingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curve down from the line of sight , and an excessively long barrel . Fenimore Cooper betrayed a certain innocence of the hard facts of life when he represented Natty Bumppo as knocking out an Indian by clubbing him with the butt of his rifle and then using the rifle to shoot with . If Bumppo knew what he was about , he hit the Indian with the barrel of his rifle and preserved its delicate stock from being broken in two at the wrist , or slenderest part . The usual explanation of the Kentucky stock is that it was designed for Indian fighting in forested country . You could stand behind a tree with the muzzle pointed at the Indian and the curve of the butt plate on your upper arm . You were covered by the tree , but you were all set to make a quick shot without exposing more than part of your head , by simply raising your elbow . A straighter stock would have made the trick more difficult . The man with the Kentucky rifle took a wooden stopper out of his powder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and struck it off flush . He poured the measured charge into the muzzle . " Why , " I asked , " did they make the barrel so long ? " " They thought it burned more powder , " he said . " But it did n't . I think it was a mistake . Did you ever try to carry a rifle as long as this one through the brush ? " I nodded . The rifle that had made me so much trouble in a laurel thicket was n't so long as that Kentucky , but it was long . My friend picked up a yard of blueand-white striped bed ticking and put one corner over the muzzle of his rifle . He put a round hull of shining new lead on the cloth , taking care that the flat place Left where he had cut off the sprue , meaning the lump left by the pouring , was up . He pressed the ball down flush with the muzzle and cut off the surplus cloth with a sharp knife . Then he took a starter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a knob , and a mallet . He tapped the starter with the mallet , driving the ball well down . He pushed the ball the rest of the way with a ramrod . Finally he took a small flask of fine-grained powder and poured a little on the pan , where it would catch the sparks when the flint struck steel . It sounds like a lot of trouble , and it is . This is what interested the man who was loading the gun . He had so much more to do with the result than a man who buys factoryammunition to fit a factory gun . When the light failed between four and five o'clock in the afternoon , everybody drove to Dillsboro , a town of more than 500 , with a hotel built beside two wells of mineral water . The hotel was jammed with gun cranks . You could get an argument there over the merits of the gaintwist , or the virtues of famous American makers of muzzle-loading rifles  --  Edwin Wesson , William Billinghurst , Morgan James , H. V. Perry , Horace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their successors  --  some of them present in person  --  or anything else involving guns . Forty-Rod Guns had too brief a chance to talk to Adolph Niedner , whom I have heard about since I was a small boy . isleidner made things over a period of ten years for the late Franklin W. Mann , author of the classic American work on exterior ballistics , The Bullet 's Flight from Powder to Target . I met John Buhmiller , station agent at Eureka , Montana , who spends his spare time making rifles and shooting them , and who gets worried when some enthusiast reports shooting from one of his barrels that sounds too good . I listened to Bull Ramsey , who told me marvelous tales of backwoods gunsmiths , such as Win Woods , who made himself a muzzle-loading squirrel rill , using the steering post of an automobile for the barrel . I saw N. H. Roberts , who shot his first bear in a blueberry patch in Vermont with a muzzle-loading rifle . I talked to Walter Cline , of Chattanooga , who knows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself an authority on muzzle-loading rifles . if I went to bed at four o'clock in the morning , it was only because I was told that I would have to appear for breakfast before eight or go without . The next day , which reached the peak of Indian summer , except that there was a bit of wind , I had a chance to get closer to those forty-rod guns . They are just as American as the Kentucky rifle , But they were not intended for any everyday purpose . They were designed and built by men who wanted to know what a rifle could be made to do nt the target , and they led to contests still debated among riflemen . I have recently read a book by John Chapman , called The Improved American Rifle , published in 1848 , but written several years earlier , which is chiefly devoted to forty-rod guns . Chapman admired above all other rifles those made by Edwin Wesson , of Northboro , Massachusetts , and fitted with the Clark false muzzle . He shows targets shot at forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove that accurate rifles are not something that came in with the motorcar . There were no Wesson rifles on the firing line at Friendship , but there was ( Continued on Pave 17 ) ( Continued from Page 27 ) hunting fur a muzzle-loading rifle to shoot in their matches before you know it , and even tip you off where to find one . Sunday proved a perfect day for shooting . But no one knows when the wind will pick up on a perfect October day . So I was startled when , at half past nine in the morning , the loudspeaker announced that we were all going to church . What is more , we all did . Men who had got sighted in and were ready to shoot their matches picked up their rifles and marched a quarter of a mile to the Baptist church . The sermon was short  --  so short that it was plain the pastor sympathized with men who were all set to shoot before the wind came up . After the service the men shouldered the guns they had left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the range , and again the dust rose in puffs from the dry hillside as the bullets from the long rifles struck , and the ladies of the Baptist church went to work to cook a big dinner for a crowd which by now numbered five or six hundred , including more spectators than I ever saw at a rifle match before . There is more to see at a muzzle-loading match than at most rifle matches . It was rumored that going to church was a compliment to the ladies who did the cooking , who might otherwise have felt it improper to cook on Sunday . But the march to church may have been a tribute to Boss Johnston , president of the National Muzzle-Loading Rifle Association , who asked everybody to go . That night , when the matches were all over , though the scores were n't in , I met two men who wanted to shoot , but who had n't been able to find muzzle-loading rifles in good condition . One of them , L. M. Wolfe , is a garage mechanic . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had both solved the problem in the same way . They had made their own rifles , from butt to false muzzle , with tools they had made themselves . That might be called the American way . When I got home I remembered that I still did n't know why the Kentucky rifle was a long rifle . I asked Harry Pope if he knew why . " Yes , " he answered ; " it was to get holding weight without carrying weight . " I felt simple-minded . I should have known that answer . Of course a rifle must be muzzle-heavy . That 's where the weight counts in slowing down the swing . And if the barrel ca n't be thick , then it must be long . Daniel Boone was n't following a fashion . He knew what he needed .
