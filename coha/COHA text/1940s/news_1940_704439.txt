Storm troopers have issued an Invitation to 50,000 men who have been , at the western front and who have no relatives , to spend their leaves with them . Workers have been told that they henceforth would be entitled to their vacations , which were abolished at the outbreak of the war . Hanover has requisitioned one of its big hotels for use during train waits by men returning from the front . Special loud speakers have been installed to announce the time of train departures because the-war coal shortage has disrupted German train service and only a few trains are running . To end overcrowding of trains , resulting from the few now running , the railroad administration has announced it will sell only as many tickets as there are seats . It also has abolished low rate tickets for weekends and vacations.
