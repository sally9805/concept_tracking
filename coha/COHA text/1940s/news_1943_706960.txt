To 149 reporters who crowded into his White House executive office for a special press conference to hear the President tell of his unprecedented trip by plane to the North African theatre of war , he emphasized that the conferences between him , Prime Minister Winston Churchill and their respective military advisers had been primarily to make plans for war on land and sea and in the air during 1943 . The hint that a European invasion had been , planned , and the time and place selected , came when the President picked up a copy df this Jan. 7 " State of the Balkan area might have been chosen for the American-British Invasion and that Turkish permission - for unhampered transit through the Dardanelles was sought .

Mr. Roosevelt replied that he did not think he could talk about whether there was agreement or disagreement on such highly confidential matters , but he could state that things were going extremely well . He cautioned reporters , however , not to infer that disagreement did exist because he would not read them all the cables passing between him and the Russian war leader . At the same time the President vigorously assailed critics who had expressed regret that Mr. Stalin and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek were not included in the Casablanca , talks . Wendell L. Willkie , 1940 Republican Presidential nominee , is one who has expressed this view .

Hope springs eternal , was the President 's reply . Reporters drew the impression that , ' besides the second front problem , the President and Prime Minister , and , later Mr. Roosevelt and President Getulio Vargas of Brazil , had given considerable attention to efforts to eliminate the submarine menace in the Atlantic . Mr. Roosevelt said that as a result of his talks with President Vargas it was hoped that Brazil 's contributions in the form of air patrols and surface vessels against the submarine menace could be expanded .

They now are working two shifts . Mentions Japan and Italy In his press conference discussion of the Casablanca war planning the President mentioned Japan and Italy only once . The reference to Japan was in explanation of why Premier Stalin could not sit at the same war conference table with Generalissimo Chiang . The reference to Italy came when the President laughingly described Casablanca as a rumor factory that outdid Washington . He said one of the reports in the Moroccan town had King Victor Emmanuel Of .

Asked if this meant post-war demilitarization of West Africa , the President said it was difficult to state the method of achieving his goal , since the method had not yet been decided upon . It might be demilitarization or any other of a half dozen solutions , he added . The President also talked at some length of the steps that must be taken after the war to improve the standard of living and control diseases among the populations on the West African coast .

Day in and day out we shall heap tons upon tons of explosives upon their war factories and utilities and seaports . " It was in fulfillment of that statement , the President continued , that the United States and Great Britain had worked through their combined staffs and reached a unanimous agreement . The decisions , he said , have been communicated to Premier Joseph Stalin of Russia and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek , who were kept in close touch with the proceedings of the conference . When the Casablanca war planning was concluded , Prime Minister Churchill flew to Cairo and on to Turkey for talks with President Ismet Izionu , which Mr. Roosevelt said were in.regard to a closer re-= lationship. with-Turkey in the prosecution of the war . - - This led to speculation . that the                   @ @
