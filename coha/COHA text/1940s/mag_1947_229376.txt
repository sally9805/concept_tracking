" These that have turned the world upside down , " is what the Apostles Paul and Silas were called at Thessalonica . In Christianity 's early days , the gospel of Jesus Christ was a revolutionary religion indeed . <P> It still is . Though Christianity has taken on age , respectability and power-and though some Christians seem to assume that God is always on the side of the status quo-the basic teachings of Jesus still challenge the accepted ways of the world . Published last week was a book about five religious thinkers called Modern Christian Revolutionaries ( Devin-Adair ; $4 ) , edited by British Catholic Donald Attwater . First published piecemeal in England , this collection of studies by different authors is what Editor Attwater calls " a very mixed bag . " Two of its subjects are Protestants , two Catholics and one is Russian Orthodox . Three are especially notable for general readers : <P> Sren Kierkegaard , a lonely , God-hungry Dane , waged his revolution against the excessive rationalism of the mechanistic 19th Century in which he lived . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but dealt with the universe in terms of man 's own suffering , fearing , loving and hating-much as does present-day psychology. * For contemporary Denmark 's official church Christianity , Protestant Kierkegaard had nothing but contempt , though he himself had been trained for the Danish ministry . His anger boiled over in such pronouncements as " Parsons canonize bourgeois mediocrity " and " Official Christianity is both aesthetically and intellectually ludicrous and indecent , a scandal in the Christian sense . " On his deathbed in 1855 at the age of 42 , Kierkegaard refused all churchly ministrations , saying that " the parsons are royal functionaires , and royal functionaires are not related to Christianity . " <P> Author Gilbert Keith Chesterton passionately accepted the orthodoxy that Kierkegaard scorned . A devout member of the Church of England from his youth , at the age of 48 he became a Roman Catholic . But though he accepted and stoutly defended every word of Roman Catholic dogma , he denounced the economic orthodoxy of modern capitalism . <P> Though he adopted some of the analyses of Marxism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future ( with the dictatorship of the proletariat ) but in the past . In the Middle Ages , said he , men inhabited " a world more wonderful than the eyes of men have looked on before or after . . . and saw St. Francis walking with his halo a cloud of birds . " <P> Chesterton advocated communal ownership of large-scale industry and decentralized agriculture . But as a revolutionary he was very much of an Englishman . The threat of World War I forced him to choose armaments produced by capitalists rather than socialist-pacifist unpreparedness . <P> Arthur Eric Rowton Gill said : " I am an ordinary man who refuses to be bamboozled . " But Eric Gill , born in 1882 as the second of a poor nonconformist minister 's 13 children , was far from ordinary . One of England 's top sculptors and wood carvers , he was also a Christian whose religious simplicity led him to beat a hasty and disgusted retreat from the great names of the art world .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
