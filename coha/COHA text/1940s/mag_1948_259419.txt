Lend an Ear ( sketches , lyrics &; music by Charles Gaynor ; produced by William R. Katzell , Franklin Gilbert &; William Eythe ) blossoms out , after a long , wintry start , into a really gay intimate revue . Hailing from the West Coast , it often has a rough-diamond , loud-check sense of fun about it ; and can be strenuously youthful as well as unpolished . But it has the greatest of assets for an intimate revue-a satiric eye and sassy tongue ; and when it manages to be deft and daft at once , is thoroughly hilarious . <P> Its best jokes are family jokes , jabbing aspects of the entertainment world that age has withered or custom staled . There is a lush spoof of a road-company opera that the unpaid musicians have walked out on ; and opera done without music can be flayed without mercy . There is a tearful but cheerful lament by three washed-up queens of the silent films ; above all , there is " The Gladiola Girl , " a wonderfully funny , insanely accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see cut ) . <P> Lend an Ear attempts other targets with varying aim : those squalid Latin American tourist villages where hot sex and heavy gunfire are hourly occurrences in the public square ; a bandleader and his wife sweating to live up to the lurid-and contradictory-bulletins the columnists issue about them ; an old-fashioned Friday afternoon dancing class , in which the Penrod motif loses out to the pretty-pretty . There are the **25;8945;TOOLONG numbers in Lend an Ear , and some pleasantly forgettable tunes . <P> As is pretty much the rule with intimate revues , Lend an Ear is almost completely new faces and unknown names . But a number of these-as is pretty much the rule , too , when the revues are any good-may before long be pleasantly familiar . Among the others : Yvonne Adair , George Hall and Carol Channing , a large doll-eyed blonde who can be almost spectacularly funny . <P> . . . <P> It took seven years for Lend an Ear to get to Broadway . It took Author Charles Gaynor 19 . Ever since Dartmouth he had wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opening , he did such odd jobs as playing the piano at weddings and writing college songs for a Fred Waring radio program . Having now performed the rare feat of writing the music , lyrics and sketches for a hit revue ( almost always a collaborators ' patchwork ) , he is planning a musical comedy . <P> Lend an Ear was written for the Pittsburgh Playhouse just before the war . One version lasted two weeks in a summer theater in 1941 ; another opened this June in Los Angeles , where it is now entering its 26th week . The 18 numbers in the Broadway version include only four from the 1941 original . It had incubated so long that a straight-faced Latin number had to be rewritten as a parody of itself .
