While other planemakers raced to produce cheaper planes for a wider market , soft-spoken Leroy Grumman galloped off in the other direction . This week his Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corp . announced its postwar commercial model , the Mallard , an eight-to-ten-passenger amphibian with lush-plush custom-tailored interior . Price : $100,000 &; up ( depending on the interior arrangement selected ) . <P> The plane was built for well-heeled businessmen and corporation executives who want to go anywhere , any time at 180 m.p.h . Other possible buyers : sportsman pilots , newspapers , which have already shown an interest in Mallards with built-in darkrooms , the Navy and Coast Guard , long Grumman 's best customers .
