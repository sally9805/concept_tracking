Tin Pan Alley always keeps only a jump behind the international situation . The preoccupation of songwriters with U. S. patriotism put three flag-waving songs on Variety 's best-selling list. * The assault on England has boosted A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square to No. 3 on the list . But the fall of France has inspired the best tune : The Last Time I Saw Paris , by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II . Not yet a bestseller , this song was well on its way last week . Kate Smith had had exclusive radio rights to it for six weeks . There were half a dozen records of it , of which silky-voiced Hildegarde 's ( Decca ) best captured its nostalgia for the boulevards : <P> The last time I saw Paris , Her trees were dressed for spring , And lovers walked beneath those trees , And birds found songs to sing . . . . The last time I saw Paris , Her heart was warm and gay . No matter how they change her I 'll remember her that way. + @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Composer Kern ( Show Boat , Sunny , Music in the Air ) .
