In Rome , where housing is just as scarce as in New York , London , Paris , * Moscow , Cape Town or Shanghai , one Carlo Levi , an Italian writer , painter and sculptor , was in a universal predicament . His landlord wanted to throw him out of his studio in the venerable Palazzo Altieri , so the place could be remodeled into smaller apartments . Levi , of course , had nowhere else to go . <P> The landlord decorated the studio 's marble staircase with ripe garbage , cut off water and telephone service , and finally tried to budge Levi by painting insulting inscriptions on the studio walls . Samples : " Carlo Levi is a bandit and a rascal . . . . Since Carlo Levi refuses to make way for the worthy and the homeless , ca n't he have the decency to instruct his girl friends not to slam the door when they leave him at 4 a.m. ? " <P> Artist Levi fought back the only way he knew how . He began painting in the halls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his landlord . <P> <P> * The Georges Bidaults , who since 1944 ' have lived in a comfortable apartment in the French Foreign Office , were embarrassed last fortnight when Bidault ceased to be Premier-President and Foreign Minister and thus lost his home . The Bidaults could find no place to go . But his successor Lon Blum told the flustered Bidaults that there was no hurry about moving out .
