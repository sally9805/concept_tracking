So far this year 274 of the news stories TIME has printed have been contributed ( or substantially contributed to ) by our Chicago news bureau . Of all TIME 'S 13 domestic bureaus ( whose function is to give TIME its own intimate coverage of nationally interesting local news ) . Chicago has the most difficult geographical assignment . Its territory extends west to the Black Hills of the Dakotas , south as far as Oklahoma . <P> To cover the news ( from politics to art ) in this great slice of the American Midwest requires not only the expert services of reporters in Minneapolis , Omaha , Kansas City , Des Moines , etc. , but also demands plenty of travel from Chicago 's five-man staff . Indicative of this kind of personal coverage are these anecdotes from Chicago reporters James Bell , Serrell Hillman and Eleanor Steinert : <P> Bell was in Omaha examining the Nebraska senatorial race when Chicago telephoned to pick up UNRRA 's Fiorello LaGuardia in Fargo , N.Dak. , before noon the next day . After badgering two airlines into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was on hand to meet LaGuardia at the airport , rescue his hat from the prairie wind , and go with him to Climax , Minn . Bell managed to catch a few hours ' sleep in the sample room of a local hotel . <P> When a photographer tried to get LaGuardia to pose in a truckload of wheat , he refused , saying : " It 'll hurt the wheat . " " Wo n't it ? " he asked , turning to Bell . " No , " said Bell , " farmers often pack it that way . " " How do you know ? " LaGuardia demanded . Said Bell : " I 'm from Kansas . " " Well , " LaGuardia decided . " I wo n't stand in it . It 'll look silly . " So he did n't stand in it . <P> When mystery story writer Craig Rice was covering the Heirens murder story for a Chicago paper , Hillman called to get some dope on her assignment , was invited to go along on " a terrific clue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be some strange pencil scribblings on a package that one of Rice 's readers had received from Sears , Roebuck and Co . It was , of course , a dud . <P> Steinert likes to recall the embarrassment she underwent in being misquoted about music czar James Caesar <P> Petrillo . Petrillo had told her : " We do n't want any victories or any fights . We just want to live . " The copy , garbled in transit by Western Union , which was on strike , came out in TIME : " We just want to love . " When Steinert sought to placate Petrillo by suggesting that the mistake might not have happened if the communications company had not been struck , he laughed and bellowed : " That 's right ; these damn unions are gon na ruin the country ! " <P> And so it goes , so far as the Chicago bureau is concerned . It was the need for this kind of local-national coverage that moved TIME to open its first out-of-town news bureau - in Chicago - 17 years ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a funnel for the news of the U.S. 's second largest city and the great slice of the Midwest stretching out from it . By virtue of being there , Chicago bureaumen , working closely with TIME correspondents in major cities within their area , can be expected to supply
