TN 1828 Bronson Alcott , who had .1peddled Yankee notions in Virginia and New York , approached at last , in breathless awe , the city of Boston . It surpassed his dearest hopes . " There is a city in our world , " he was soon to write , upon which the light of the sun of righteousness has risen . . . . It is the same from which every pure stream of thought and purpose and performance emanates . It is the city that is set on high . It can not be hid . It is Boston ! " ' I his was indeed Athens , with culture , Mr. Emerson , and the Athenaeum . In 1855 a more realistic student of " Anglo-Saxon " Boston , himself one of its intellectual glories , declared it the central battleground of all America , " for here the two extremes meet in closest contact , in sternest strife . " To Theodore Parker Boston was Athens not so much because it produced culture as because it generated passion and conflict .

Parker , the far from temperate leader of one extreme , had a name for the other : " Call that opposition Hunker-ism ; call the opponents Hunkers . " Hunkers obliged their foes to show a vigor equal to their own : " Talk about the Catholics voting as the bishop tells ! . There are a great many bishops who never had a cross on their bosom , nor a mitre on their head , who appeal not to the authority of the Pope at Rome but to the Almighty Dollar , a pope much nearer home . " Nineteenth-century Boston , in short , was a boom town , plenty tough , and thus it made both history and money . By now all this seems far away and long ago . What could have made Alcott lyrical or Parker furious ?

It is peopled with amusing eccentrics , who above all have no relation to present social problems . ' It is an island of complacency , almost as ideal a refuge for nostalgia as Father Day 's parlor . It has achieved the apotheosis of a literary stereotype , a theme for witty books that undoubtedly circulate more copies in Omaha than in South Boston . It ought to be a commonplace of scholarship  --  too often it is forgotten  --  that a literary convention on this level of popularity is primarily a creation of the public that embraces it . The lay figure may bear no close or even any resemblance . to the subject he is supposed to represent ; he is a symbol of what the at , dience wants , not of the fact . Buffalo Bill was an invention of American mythology , only incidentally Colonel Cody . Sometimes the Colonel Cody strives to merge himself with the legend until he ceases to have any self , but often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finds a certain protection , not to say profit , in the existence of his alter ego . t'or reasons that it would take a sociological treatise to expound , the banker and the merchant no longer become heroes very easily . This may be disconcerting ; Hunkers prospered enormously while being denounced as Hunkers , but can they operate with confidence when they are supposed to be on the way out ? Then it begins to appear that the new figure of comedy will do as well as , maybe even better than , the image of the Hunker . Any group will try to survive , by one means if not ' by another . Against a declining economy or against new competitors , if it can be established as quaint and queer , it may remain as a fixture . So Boston sooiet , to judge by the documentation , appears to be offering itself up as a willing sacrifice . Again it is pioneering a stage in the history of the middle Class by arraying itself before the delighted public as a curiosity , an almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Actually , of course , it is doing nothing of the sort . But the legend serves , and perhaps internal tension in Boston can ' be handled behind this fa  --  ade more neatly than in Detroit . There is indeed a local idiom , but the realities of Boston , as experience teaches and Mr. Gunther confirms , are astonishingly like those of Chicago . Ultimately one most regrets the vogue of this convention because among readers in other parts of the nation it encourages the superstition that regional differences are fundamental . It obscures the fact that they all grew up in the age of Hunkerism . The latest addition to this literatiZe of Boston is Mr. Amory 's " The Proper Bostonians. " - It is weak on history but rich in anecdote , and written con amore . It is great fun to read for about half of it  --  any half . Thereafter this convention , like any other convention of local-color fiction , like Bret Harte 's miners or Colonel Carter of Cartersville , when kept going too long , becomes repetitious and tedious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE UNITED STATES AND JAPAN-1941 . By Walter Millis . ' William Morrow and Company . $4 . N EARLIER book by Mr. Millis , " The Martial Spirit , " was an ironic and admirable study of the way we got into the war with Spain and destroyed Cervera 's fleet , stormed San Juan Hill , and in general carried out the instructions of Manifest Destiny . Mr. Millis was very severe in his criticism both of the Hearst press , which he thought was mainly responsible for the war , and of the bungling but finally successful efforts of our admirals and generals to -4 , assert our superiority over the ill-equipped forces of the Queen Regent . " This Is Pearl ! " is a riper and wiser book . It tells two stories  --  one of the diplomatic negotiations which led up to the Japanese attack on our Pacific fleet , the other of the incredible lack of preparation at Pearl Harbor , which alone made the attack a success . The two stories are interwoven with the skill of a Dumas ; by frequent references @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task force was assembling in the Kuriles , it was steaming toward Oahu , its planes were warming up on the flight decks  --  he gives heightened significance to the account of the negotiations in Washington . It is typical of the disillusionment which has already seized America that some people now contend that President Roosevelt and Secretary Hull deliberately " forced " the Japanese to attack us and with Machiavellian cunning left the commanders on Oahu uninformed so that the Japanese attack would succeed . The object , we are told , was to get us into the war with Germany , and the Roosevelt-haters have not dropped the story , even though Hitler and Mussolini followed up Pearl Harbor by declaring war on us . Any decent American feels unclean from merely setting down such calumnies , and we are all in debt to Mr. Millis for making the record clear . There are , as he admits , gaps in his narrative , and the publication of all the documents in the archives of the State Department and the Combined Chiefs of Staff will no doubt alter some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation , together with the memoirs of Grew , General Brereton , and others , were available to Mr. Millis , and this would appear to be the definitive account , for our time at least . Mr. Millis is convinced that the July 25 order freezing all Japanese assets in the United States rather than Secretary Hull 's note of September 26 was the turning-point of the negotiations , and that from then on the Japanese militarists , who had been torn between the northward program against Russia and the southern program against the Dutch , the British , and ourselves , knew what they had to do . He emphasizes his belief that economic sanctions , instead of slowing up the militarists , only made them hasten their preparations , and , he thus seems to uphold the State Department 's policy of not cutting off scrap iron or oil until the eleventh hour . All in all , Mr. Millis 's account must inevitably increase the world 's respect for the President and his Secretary of State . He concedes that they followed " policies which , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but adds that , to his mind , " the Roosevelt Administration 626 had no other choices than those which it successively took . " In view of the sentiments expressed at the time by Herbert Hoover , Charles A. Lindbergh , et al. , which Mr. Millis rescues from oblivion to explain the difficulties of standing up to aggression , Americans can congratulate themselves that they had such leaders  --  and that the folly of the Japanese attack vindicated their leadership . Not all was perfect , of course , in Washington . It was a loosely knit government , and Mr. Stimson did not know until the next day whether Mr. Hull had actually delivered the first United States note . Since we were intercept . ing and decoding all the Japanese instructions to their Washington envoys , the failure of the War and Navy departments to require real preparedness at Pearl Harbor was a blunder . General Marshall and Admiral Stark were busy building up an army and navy to fight a year later , and their war plans and intelligence officers were not equal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , Short and Kimmel  --  together with Rear Admiral Block , commander of the Pearl Harbor base  --  had only to read the newspapers to know that war was approaching . As he says , they " somehow managed to violate nearly every precept of history and of military security , and thus to lay the great base as open as possible to the precise form of attack which all of them had recognized , theoretically , as the most to be feared . " It is a shocking story . Arnericans have a right to be proud , however , of the G. I. on Oahu who spotted the attack by radar , of the navy lieutenant in Washington who tried to make the top brass understand the significance of the hour when the Japanese would give Mr. Hull their final answer  --  which was - dawn at Pearl Harbor . Mr. Millis , incidentally , holds General MacArthur responsible for the still more inexplicable lack of preparedness in the Philippines , when the Japanese , hours later , followed up their attack on Pearl Harbor by destroying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
