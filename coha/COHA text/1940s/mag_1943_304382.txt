Elegant Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle Jr. , the world 's only sextuple ambassador , turned up in Washington last week . He skated down the marble halls of the ancient State Department to see his chief , Cordell Hull , emerged 35 minutes later , debonair , gay , loquacious as always . <P> " So glad to see you , old boy , " he said to the first reporter he saw . " I 've never seen you looking better . " The reporter had never seen Mr. Biddle before , but Tony Biddle is always glad to see everybody , invariably hail-well-meets him as " old man , " " old boy , " and sometimes " old fellow . " <P> Tony Biddle regretted , in his best diplomatic manner , that he would not be able to talk of his work as U.S. Ambassador to the exiled governments of the Poles , Czechs , Norwegians , Belgians and Dutch , and Minister to the Luxembourgers . ( " Really , old boy , I 've just scratched the surface in my talk at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite willing to give newsmen the pitch on other things , if you like , old boy . <P> " Would he be Senator Joe Guffey 's candidate for the other Senatorial post from Pennsylvania ? " <P> Tony Biddle clutched his hand to his heart , caught his breath , replied : " Do n't tell me they want me to run . Honestly , I have n't been talked to as yet . There will be but one answer : ' No . ' I plan to go back to London very shortly , boy . " <P> Tony Biddle paused to brush a few long , white dog hairs off his blue business suit . He was , as always , faultlessly dressed : white shirt with horizontal black stripes , grey tie , red pocket handkerchief . <P> He was disturbed by the flu epidemic in London : " Everybody is coming down with it , you know . It 's really only a very light kind of flu , keeps you in bed only four or five days . The only really bad part is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . The aftereffect is really alarming , old boy . Understand you 're getting a similar epidemic here . Better watch the blood pressure , you know . " <P> The British , said Tony Biddle , had found a cure for the flu , an old and trusted remedy : anyone who shows the slightest symptoms is given a healthy shot of whiskey . <P> ' ' And really , it 's not a bit hard to take . Quite painless , you know . " Asking another question , the reporter 's voice suddenly grew hoarse . " God bless you , old boy , " said Tony , " you 'd better take some of my advice on all this . " <P> He was off , down the long corridor , off for a weekend at his Philadelphia home . " Just to dust off the family cobwebs a bit , old boy . "
