txt ACTION BY TRUMAN ON STRIKES IN VIEW TO AVERT DISASTER Aide Declares President Will Step In Unless Steel , Coal Tie-Ups End This Week CHING PUSHES MEDIATION Talks With Both Sides in Steel Due Today as Murray Comes , Here for Garden Rally By A. H. RASKIN A high Administration official asserted yesterday that President Truman would make a perAnal effort to end the crippling steel and coal strikes if they were not settled by this week-end . This and other press association reports from Washington of prospective Presidential intervention to prevent a general paralysis of American- industry persisted in the face of continued denials by Charles G. Ross , White House press secretary , that the President had any plans for taking a hand in either strike . Any chance that the six-weekold coal stoppage would end before the week-end was removed when representatives of the Southern coal operators and the United Mine Workers recessed their fruitless negotiations until Tuesday . Talks between the union and the Northern operators collapsed last week and no Government mediation conferences are in prospect . Cyrus S. Ching , director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been devoting all of his energies to mediating I the twenty-six-day-old steel strike , is expected to decide today whether to inform the President that further mediation is futile . Mr. Ching , assisted by his two principal aides , William N. Margolis and Peter Seitz , conferred for three hours yesterday with officials of the United States Steel Corporation .. They scheduled another meeting for 10 A. M. today . It was believed likely that Mr. Ching also would arrange a meeting with Philip Murray , president of the United Steelworkers of America , CIO , who is coming here today to speak at a Madison Square Garden rally in support of former Gov . Herbert H. Lehman and Mayor O'Dwyer in the Senate and mayoralty races . By the end of the day , the mediators believe , they will be in a position to judge whether a settlement of the steel dispute is possible through further conferences or whether the sole hope rests with the White House . A flood of reports from all parts // Truman Ready to ' Act if Strikes Go Into Next Week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of the heavy , blows being ' dealt to the economy by the two big strikes . In Huntington , W. Va. , heart of one of the richest mine regions in the country , the largest hospital reported that it was down , ' to a ten-day supply of coal : School officials there said they would be " sunk " if a stretch of cold weather . hit the city . - Railroad layoffs ? mounted under the impact of 600 train cancellations made to conserve coal . The Ohio Rubber Company dropped 100 workers as tire orders fell off from automobile companies affected by the steel strike . In Youngstown , Ohio , authorities sought permission to issue $100,000 ' in rehef notes to meet requests for aid from steel strikers and their families . Administration Aide Quoted The assertion that the President had decided to act in the two strikes came from an official who declined to permit use of his name . The Associated Press quoted the official as saying in Washington : " We ca n't let this thing go on beyond this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the economy . " There was no hint of the specific course Mr. Truman might take in his strike-settlement efforts . Federal laboradvisers said they believed the first move would come in steel , because Government surveys indicated that the lack of steel would cause a more immediate collapse of industrial activity than shortages of coal . These officials predicted that the President would call top executives of United States Steel and Mr. Murray 's union to the White House early next week and tell them in the bluntest terms that the country 's welfare required a prompt termination of their dispute over pension and welfare funds . According to these officials , Mr. Truman would then set a twentyfour or forty-eight hour deadline for effectuation of an agreement by the parties through direct negotiations in the White House itself . If no agreement was reached the Prseident might publicly call on both sides to accept the recommendatidns of his steel t'et-finding board as a basis for terminating the walkout , it was added . Basis of the tispute This would constitute a full victory for the union. ; which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel companies to'comply with the report . United States Steel and other large companies have agreed to pay the 10 cents an hour proposed by the board for pensions . and social insurance , but have insisted that their workers make a supplementary contribution . Irving S. Olds , chairman of United States Steel , said Tuesday that he felt any pressure by the President to_the compel the companies to go along with the panel 's recommendation that employers pay the full cost of pensions would represent a breach of Mr. Truman 's advance assurances to both sides that they would not " be bound by I the board 's report . The big question that remained unanswered was what the President would do if none of his suggestions for a direct settlement was voluntarily adopted by the industry or the union . Several officials said unequivocally they did not believe the President would invoke the strike-halting provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act , which he is seeking to eliminate from the statute books . Under the Taft-Hartley Law Mr. Truman could take steps , to ebtain an eighty-day injunction against continuation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use of this procedure in Steel . One was that the union had voluntarily postponed its strike for seventy-seven days at the President 's request . The second was that there was nothing in the law that would prevent resumption of the strike at the end of the " cooling-off " period . Murray Cites Strike Delay Mr. Murray , who is president of the Congress of Industrial Organizations as ' well as the steel union , said in Cleveland earlier . this week that he felt invocation of - the TaftHartley Law to end the steel tie-'i up would be unfair to his organization because of its pre-strike agreements to keep its Members at work while the Presidential factfinders Made their study . There was widespread speculation in Governmental circles that , the President might seize the steel ' industry as . a means of restoring production , but no clear-cut legal authority for such action was cited . The Smith-Connally Act , under which the President seized the coal mines and other key industries in wartime , is no longer in effect . The Selective Service Act of 1948 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted there was doubt of the applicability of these powers to seizures in labor disputes . It was suggested that Mr. Truman might apply the " inherent " powers of his office to take over the industry . *These were cited by Attorney General Tom Clark , before his recent elevation to ' the ' Supreme Court , in testimony before Congress on repeal of the Taft-Hartley ' Act. , The extent of these powers has been questioned by Senator Robert ' A. Taft , coaiithor of the Taft-Hartley Law , and others . ? A last possibility on which there was some speculation was that the President might call Congress back into special session and ask it to pass legislation specifically designed to authorize seizure of the steeled coal industries . This possibility was discounted by most officials because of the time required to got Congress back into session and because it would represent an admission that the Administration was powerless to cope with an emergency . Coal Factors Different Some officials said they believed the President might use the TaftHartley Act against John L. Lewis 's United Mine Workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ td those already held in steel . Mr. Lewis has indicated that he would resist such fact-finding and has stated ? that Government seizure represents the only kind of Federal intervention that would be effective in ending the mine strike . ? In telegrams yesterday to Mr. Ching a group of small . steel companies urged that the steel factfinding board be recalled to explain what it meant by " good faith , individual collective bargaining " between the steel companies and the union . The small companies contend that their financial position does not allow them to match the 10= cent-an-hour pensionand inurance offer made by the larger companies , but that the union is insisting on forcing a pattern on the industry without regard for individual " ability to pay . " Aides of Mr. Ching , said that there were only two ways in which the board could be recalled . One was by a joint request from the union and the companies , the other-by a call from the President . Among the companies that , asked special consideration of their case was the Allegheny Ludlum Steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its contract with the union expires at midnight Monday , when its 14,000 workers are scheduled to join the national walkout . The other companies , involved have been shut down since Oct. 1 . No-New Move for Talks A suggestion Tuesday by Mr. Olds for resumption of direct negotiations between the union and " Big Steel " was not folhneed up yesterday by any formal request from the company for new meetings with the Murray group . Company officials said they felt it was up to Mr. Ching to decide whether such meetings should be held while mediation was going on . Mr. Ching told reporters that he was " a ' great believer in direct negotiations , " but declined to indicate whether he would sponsor a call for joint meetings at this time . It was expected that a definitive decision on the advisability of such meetings would be made after the mediators had held their expected conferences with each side today . There have been no face-toface meetings between company and union officials since the strike began . The recess in the Southern coal negotiations was taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that accomplished nothing . In announcing that there would be no further sessions until Tuesday , Joseph E. Moody , president of the Southern Coal Producers Association , said : " It looks like a very bad Christmas for the coal areas . " The Lewis union is seeking a cut in the work day to seven hours , a rise in daily wages and an increase in the welfare fund royalty of 20 cents a ton . The operators have refused to make any concessions that would involve higher labor costs . The Brooklyn Union Gas Company reported that it had a thirtyfour-day supply of coal ' ' For the coking ovens it uses in manufacturing gas for the families it serves in Brooklyn and Queens . The State Public Service Commission will hold a hearing tomorrow to determine whether . the situation creates an emergency fo : the company in view of the time that would be required to refill its coal piles even if the strike were settled soon . The commission may Unlit the company 's right to extend service to new house-heating customers if it decides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
