THE LOAN A STORY BY NEIL S. BOARDMAN Illustrations by Bernarda Bryson F oR the third time he walked past the entrance to the building . Yesterday he had gone by once , encircled the block and returned to his room ; this morning , before work , he had penetrated the red brick hulk as far as the lobby . Now was the last chance . It was Saturday afternoon . He told himself that his head ached from too much close work at the office , but he knew that he was only hungry . In his pocket was a dollar bill , for dinner and Sunday 's meal in case . . . . But there was a date tonight with Ethel , and he 'd have to eat on Monday and on Tuesday morning too . Tuesday would be payday . The days ran Wednesday , Thursday , Friday , Saturday , Sunday , Monday , and Payday . On an envelope in his pocket was written : Tues Mr 16 ? Roomrent On coat Radio Carfare Meals ( @ 1.10 day ) Insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to more than he 'd get , but still the thought of payday warmed him . If only he had enough for tonight . He could n't stall Ethel off a second time by saying he 'd lost his wallet . Turning back he walked slowly toward the building . People were going in and coming out , and why should n't he go in and come out and how could anyone notice him in particular ? No one paid any attention to a fellow going in and out of a large building . As he approached the entrance he ran over in his mind , for the hundredth time , the names of friends and acquaintances who might possibly be touched for a loan . But he owed everyone ? fifty cents here , a quarter there , and that awful ten dollars to Charlie . He hated Charlie for that ten spot he owed him . If he could pay him tonight , if he could settle with his landlady , if he could get his laundry out of hock  --  well , it was worth a try , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was n't it ? And nobody need see him ; that was the main thing , he hated being seen . Everybody thought him such a level-headed young man , not the kind to skulk around like this ; what the devil was he stalling for ? He got as far as the cigar stand in the lobby when he ran into Eddie Chlebeck . Eddie was shaking dice at the counter . He had on his fur-collared coat and was smoking a pipe and looked prosperous as hell . Eddie said : " Hello , Clarence . " " Hello , Eddie . " " Whatcha doing these days ? Still at the store ? " " Yes , I 'm still at the store . " " You been at the Arcade a long time now . " " Pretty long . " " Good job ? " " Oh , so-so . Got to do something , you know . " " Yeah . Heh-heh , " Eddie laughed . You could see he did n't think much of the Arcade . Eddie looked at him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to the elevators , he was pretty sure Eddie 'd guess where he was headed for . Tossing his dollar bill on the counter he said : " A package Camels . " The man behind the counter hated to leave the dice game even to sell a package of cigarettes . He threw the Camels on the counter . He hated to make change , and threw the eighty cents on the counter too . Then he leaned on his elbows and looked at Eddie . They waited for Clarence to go . " Well , so long , Ed . " " Be seeM ' ya , fella . " Eddie called him fella whenever they met . He and Eddie were the same age ; they had graduated from high school together . H E STARTED to go outside again , but stopped half way to the door to open the package of cigarettes . It was snowing in the street , a drizzling March snow . People kept coming and going . Now he hated two people , Charlie and Eddie Chlebeck . Glancing round , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the man behind the counter had their heads together over the dice . " To hell with him , " thought Clarence , swinging round and walking past them . He had to wait for the elevator and several people came up and waited with him . As they entered the car a thin man , dressed in faded clothes , said : " Two . " That was Clarence 's stop , but he did n't want the man to see where he was going so he said : " Three . " Because the elevator man looked sharply at him he wondered what was up on three . Getting off , he saw that all of three was occupied by the offices of a big insurance company and that they were closed for the afternoon . That was why the elevator man looked at him . Slowly he walked down the worn old marble steps to two , stopping once to light his cigarette , which he had been carrying in his hand . There was a woman standing near the foot of the stairs , waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the hall he felt her eyes on his back . He stopped to get a drink at the bubble fountain , and took a long time sucking in the flat warm water until he heard the elevator door open , and then he went on . At the end of the hall was a door with the inscription on its frosted glass : LOOP LOAN COMPANY WALK IN Without looking to either side of him he opened the door and went in . I T WAS a small office , with a counter running all the way across , from wall to wall . A tall girl with long blonde hair was behind the counter ; she was taking care of somebody , writing on a little pad , but she looked up as Clarence came in . There was no place to sit down so he eased up to the counter and rested his elbows on it . Doing that made him feel unconcerned . The customer turned away with his receipt in his hand , and Clarence could see that it was the thin , beaten-looking man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't look at him but hurried to the door , and as he went out the girl called to him phonographically : " Goodby . " The thin man did n't answer , and when he was gone the girl finished filling out something on a long blue card and then she looked up at Clarence and smiled , though she did n't seem particularly pleased to see him and he felt a blush spreading from his cheek bones to the back of his neck . " Something ? " she said . " I should like to make arrangements for a loan , " he answered , using an opening he had practiced to himself all morning . Putting the blue card in a Iong envelope she asked : " Have you ever borrowed here before ? " " No , " he said . She placed the envelope on a desk behind the counter and said , " Just a minute , " and walked into another office . Stamping his half-smoked cigarette underfoot , he looked beyond the counter and office equipment out of the window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked rather pretty because the snow screened the ugliness of the buildings across the street . He wished the girl would hurry , and kept turning round and round , glancing furtively at the door . A second door , on his side of the counter , opened into the back offices , and now the girl called through it : " Will you step in here , please ? " He followed her into a small room ' where there were two desks and a man sitting behind one of the desks smoking a cigar . The man had sandy red hair brushed back over a bald spot , and pale splotches of freckles on his small bulldog face . He said : " Yes , sir , what can I do for you ? " Clarence tried to draw himself up and look his years , but he knew this man took him to be only a boy . He was glad now that he had on his new topcoat , because it made him look more prosperous . At the same time he remembered his socks had holes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ragged ; and it seemed to Clarence that the red-haired man , himself immaculately dressed in a salt and pepper suit and white linen , could see that there were holes in his socks and that his underwear was ragged . " You want to borrow some money ? " " Yes , I ? " " How much ? " " Well  --  fifty dollars ? " Fifty dollars seemed suddenly a staggering sum ; perhaps he ought to have made it twenty-five . " Where do you work ? " " At the Arcade ; I " " Have you ever borrowed here before ? " " No . " The moneylender had by this time produced a printed form and was beginning to write on it in big scrawly letters ; from where he sat Clarence could see the loop of the A in Arcade . " What 's your name ? " Clarence told him . " Address ? " As he wrote in the answers the man did not glance up , but went on to ask how long he had worked at the Arcade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of all things , Clarence hated to tell what he made . " How old are you ? " " Twenty-four . " Twenty-four , and making one hundredand-thirty-five dollars a month ! Even Ethel did n't know his salary ; nobody knew it but his employer and himself  --  and now this man . He was asked what his debts were . He tried to think of them : so much left on his overcoat , so much for the dentist , so much for that wrist watch he had given to Ethel last Christmas and put on account ; and the more he tried to juggle those untidy little sums , with their fifty and ninety-eight cent endings , the more confused and less competent , arithmetically , he became . Looking at the moneylender , cool to his pink eyebrows , Clarence tried to smile as MAGAZINE if to say , How confusing it all is and how stupid I am , heh heh ; but he was sure the smile was n't coming off , and that the moneylender thought him a damned fool . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " said the man in a faintly reassuring voice . " Oh , sure , sure , it 's . .. way under . . . that . " " Now , " resumed the man , " can you give me the names of a couple of friends ? " T HAT was a stumper Clarence had n't anticipated ; the Loop Loan Company 's advertisement had stated , " Strictly Confidential  --  No Co-Signers-No Embarrassment . " Embarrassment he had looked for , ad or no ad ; but " Confidential " ? that was absolutely essential . " Just for reference , they wo n't know a thing , " the moneylender , who apparently read people 's minds , added . " Oh , " said Clarence . " Sure . " But he could n't think of any friends ; he could n't think of any acquaintances ; he could n't think of anybody . Names of prominent customers at the Arcade ; names of moving picture stars ; names of politicians , foreign and domestic unat-tached names , long-forgotten names , heathenish sounding names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticker-taped through his brain until he was certain he had lost his senses and there was nothing left to do but run out of the office and hope that the moneylender would n't send the police after him . He went so far as picturing himself hurtling down the stairs , out through the lobby past Eddie , past  --  Eddie ! By God ! Eddie ! He smiled again ; the moneylender was looking at him with deep interest , there was almost a human expression on the bulldog face . In an apologetic voice Clarence said : " Well , there 's Eddie Chlebeck . " " Where does he live ? " ? snapping the sympathy out of his expression and reaching for the City Directory . " He lives " ( 0 Lord if he 's moved ! ) " on Georgia Street . " " What number ? " " Well , I do n't know , exactly . It 's out near 16th . You see , I " Clarence trailed off , observing that the man was satisfied . " 1609 ? " suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the finely-printed page . " That 's likely it , " said Clarence . So the man put Eddie 's name and street number and occupation on the form . Then he said : " One more . " Next to Eddie , Clarence hated Charlie the most . So he thought of Charlie , and named him ; and Charlie , whom he owed ten dollars , was put on the record . " Any relatives living in town ? " " N-no . . . " " None ? " " Well , an aunt " He and Aunt Mabel were n't on very good terms ; he had n't seen her for a year . " What 's her name ? " " Mabel Brett . " " Where does she live ? " " Morris Street . " " Work ? " " She 's a school teacher . " After he had checked Aunt Mabel in the Directory the man wanted to know about his brother , who lived in Chicago , and his sister and mother back home . There 's nothing left but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man said . ( As long , of course , as the payments were met . ) The very people he least wanted to know about this business were the very ones whose names were inscribed on that damnable sheet of paper . Excepting , of course  --  but there , it came next . " What 's the name of your superior ? " Clarence figured he must have lost at least two shades of color , for even the moneylender looked surprised , and for a fleeting instant , sympathetic . " He wo n't know , " he said . Other questions were asked , but Clarence 's mind became such a jumble he could n't remember them or whether he had given the proper answers or not and to hell with it anyhow , he thought . He could n't imagine what he had been thinking of to want fifty dollars as badly as all this ; and again an impulse came to him to get up and walk out : first to make a crushing remark , oily with sarcasm , and then walk out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , not even " Good afternoon . " Toward the end of the inquisition the man asked him for identification . He searched through his pockets and found , besides the eighty cents change , the key to his room , a bus taken he had forgotten he had , the package of cigarettes , a book of matches , a comb , two pocket-grimy mints , an empty business envelope addressed to the boss on the back of which he had written his next week 's budget , and a note from the Acme Clothing Company urging him to remember them . The bill from the Acme Clothing Company satisfied the man behind the desk , who had begun to be impatient . Glancing once again over the form , the man looked dubiously at Clarence , then cleared his throat . The moment has come , thought Clarence , his palms damp . " One more thing , " said the man . " What d' ya want this money for ? " Clarence was conscious of a dull ache behind the eyes , an ache that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only now he became aware of . What did he want the money for ? He saw himself being able to look Charlie in Charlie 's ugly face ; he saw the Acme Clothing Company no longer sending him duns ; he saw his landlady in a civil mood ; he saw Ethel . Ethel on his arm , content , no longer casting roving eyes on carefree , well-heeled young idiots . Charlie , the Acme Clothing Company , his landlady , Ethel , were a jumble in his head . " For . . . bills , " he stammered . T HE Loop Loan Company was satis- fied . It rose from its desk and left the room . Clarence sat alone , studying the calendar , the ash tray , the paper knife , the blotter on the desk . The walls of the room were pale gray . Once the man had gone the place seemed quiet and empty . He looked out of the window and could see the snow still falling on the narrow street below . The man was gone a long while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he returned and in his hand were two sheets of white paper and a long blue card . Placing the white sheets in front of Clarence , he took out his fountain pen , made light X 's at the bottom of the sheets , and said : " Just sign here . " After writing his name under the Whereas 's , the fine printing and blank spaces , Clarence learned from the man that he could pay off the debt in six installments of $11.15 each or in four installments of $16 each . Clarence said he would take the six payments of $11.15 . He tried to multiply $11.15 by six in his head but could n't manage it , and he was ashamed to ask the man what it would come to . What difference did it make anyway ? It was too late to back out now . While the man filled in the blanks Clarence watched the snow fall past the window and felt his head pound with vast surgings of blood . Nothing was clear to him after that , until he was out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at what dates he wanted to make his payments , and they had come to an agreement . Then the man had left the office again but this time was gone for only a short time . When he returned he brought the money with him : four tens and two fives . Clarence had taken the bills and pocketed them feeling like a thief . He was on the street again , and free . He had made it safely through the empty second floor corridor , down the stairs , past the pimply-faced elevator operator standing in his empty car , past the broad back of Eddie , still squandering his money on dice . He was on the street again , with the damp fresh snow blowing against his cheek , the white clean snow under his feet . It was like Christmas day ; all the world glowed and was joyous . He was free . He was rich . The magic of fifty dollars , extra cash , above and beyond his salary , given to him , as good as found , was like strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His eyes were bright , his nerves steadied , he was full of courage against the world . He swaggered through the streets . Men and women passing him , the Eddies and the Charlies and the Ethels of the universe , looked on him and saw that he was good . Stopping at a cigar store at the corner of Euclid Street and Fourth Avenue , he began his evening 's date with Ethel ( what an evening it would be ! ) by buying himself three fifteen-cent cigars . He liked a good cigar . " I like a good cigar , " he told himself , plunging down Euclid Street toward the Jefferson Flower and Candy Shoppe , eying an attractive necktie in Warner 's window . " It gives you the right feeling . The feeling of being a man of the world . The feeling Of being free . "
