Ever since Eleanor Roosevelt left Washington last April , the 70 members of the Mrs. Roosevelt 's Press Conference Association ( founded in 1941 ) have faced technological unemployment . Bess Truman simply was n't giving them anything to write about . Last week the President of the M.R.P.C.A. , who is the New York Daily News 's bland , blue-eyed Ruth Shick Montgomery , served notice on the new First Lady that she had better change her attitude-or else . <P> Taking over vacationing Washington Columnist John O'Donnell 's envenomed spot in the News , she unreeled 800 words of innuendo directed at Mrs. Truman . When Madame Chiang Kai-shek visited the White House she had been so sorry , Ruth wrote , that Mrs. Truman was away in Missouri . Ah . but actually-Ruth confided to the Daily News 's 2,000,000 readers-Mrs . Truman had been in the White House all the time . <P> Then she cooed : " Now , most Washingtonians are convinced that Mrs. Truman intended no slight in not receiving Madame Chiang . It is the sort of misunderstanding which could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began grinding out their bitter chaff-if the distaff side of the White House maintained any sort of ' diplomatic ' relations with the press . " <P> The chickabiddies of the club , who had been complaining that Ruth had not been forceful enough in presenting their case , wondered whether they had not underestimated their president . She has been underestimated before . She likes to tell about the morning she slipped into a hotel suite under a waiter 's arm , and made herself an unwelcome third party at Jimmy Cromwell 's breakfast with Wife Doris Duke ( who was wearing a sable coat and hair curlers ) . <P> For this and similar contributions to journalism , Ruth Montgomery was assigned to Washington last year , in January was elected president of the White House girls ' club . She was the only woman among the twelve reporters permitted to attend President Roosevelt 's funeral in the East Room . Since then , what with Mrs. Truman refusing to hold press conferences , she has had only scooplets to boast of : she was first with the backstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff , first to discover what colors the Trumans had painted the upstairs rooms . <P> The day the Madame Chiang column appeared , Ruth Montgomery met Mrs. Truman at a cocktail party . She was re-introduced to the First Lady by a friend who said , " Of course you read Ruth 's column . " " Oh , yes . I certainly did , " said Mrs. Truman-and smiled sweetly .
