txt 6o SOUND AND FURY American Telephone and Telegraph Company were suffering their secret doubts as to the commercial future of radio , one shrewd individual saw in the infant industry advertising potentialities to which most businessmen were blind . That man was Dr. John Romulus Brinkley , destined to stick large thorns in both the American Medical Association and the not-yet-born Federal Communications Commission . Personable , goateed and affecting diamonds ? then comparatively small , but in a few years to reach the size of a dime ? Dr. Brinkley was enjoying his first taste of fame beyond the bounds of Kansas . In Kansas , where he had set up his hospital in the rundown town of Milford , he was already a prominent figure . The notoriety of his rejuvenation operation ( in which he transplanted goat glands into human bodies ) had already marked him . Dr. Brinkley was a man of superlatives . He drove a sixteencylinder Cadillac , later bought his own cabin plane and hired his own pilot . Typically , one history would not have been enough for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annals of the American Medical Association ; in the columns of the press ; and in the records of the FCC , by those who opposed him . And one written by a hired writer and offered for sale over his radio station , called , " The Life of a Man . " The factual disagreements between the two versions appear at almost every turn of a page . A brief view of Kansas ' " Goat-Gland Doctor , " as he presented himself to a nation just beginning to accustom itself to his name in 1923 , had him born in Beta , North Carolina , in 1885 . He says that his father was a mountain doctor ; his mother , a worker for the Methodist Church . He began his education at Tuckasigall , N. C. , and , according to an application he filed to practice medicine in California that fall , he continued it at the Milton Academy , Baltimore , Md . His medical education began in 1908 at the Bennett Medical School , in Chicago , but a lack of funds halted this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he received a medical diploma ? and that diploma was issued by the Eclectic Medical University , of Kansas City , Missouri . In 1919 , he received a second , honorary diploma from this same school ? traveling at that time under the name , " Kansas City College of Medicine and Surgery " ? for services he performed as a teacher and member of its faculty . // This was the man America knew in the fall of 1923 . During the summer of 1923 , stories of the Brinkley operation had caught the eye ? and the imagination ? of able publisher Harry Chandler , of the Los Angeles Times . Intrigued , Chandler invited Brinkley to come to California and operate upon an aging editor on his staff . " If the operation is a success , " the publisher laid down his challenge , " I 'll make you the most famous surgeon in America . If it 's a failure , I 'll damn you with the same gusto . " The aging editor , at least , must have been satisfied with the results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his " goat-gland " operation a household word . Dr. Brinkley had received his first medical license in Arkansas . By reciprocal agreements between Arkansas and other states , the license to practice medicine was thus extended to more than a dozen states . California was not among these , but as a courtesy to Chandler , the state granted him a thirty-day permit . At the same time , Dr. Brinkley made formal application for a permanent license to practice in California . Chandler was then building KHJ , for the Times , and Brinkley , visiting the station , learning how it operated and finding that Americans in larger and larger numbers were beginning to buy receivers , decided that radio was for him . It offered him an opportunity to streamline old methods . For generations , Kansas had known the medicine men . They first came in gaudy red wagons with negro banjoists , minstrel men and feather-bedecked Indian chiefs . Rolling into the busiest street of a territorial town , they would make as much noise as possible and , when a crowd had collected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of speech , the slow of thought . These were Brinkley 's models . Only , where his predecessors reached one prospect , he ? by radio ? would reach thousands . Returning to Milford , he started work upon his radio station . He said that it was being erected to amuse and enlighten his convalescent patients ; and with the station well under way and the call letters , KFKB , assigned to it , Brinkley and his wife set off on a motor trip through Canada and the East . His stay in California had netted him $40,000 . His first , crude transmitter ? by the most liberal estimates ? could not have cost more than $25,000. // And then , the first great tempest burst about his ears . Brundige 's investigation of the Missouri diploma mills had shocked the nation ; and organized medicine , anxious to wipe out the dark blot which threatened to undermine public confidence in its legitimate representatives , had joined Brundige in his expose . A prime offender in the matter of issuing fake diplomas was the Eclectic Medical University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The two medical degrees which Dr. Brinkley held were from these two institutions . Caught in the dragnet of the investigation , Brinkley hurried home to Milford and to the microphone of his newly completed radio station . There , over the transmitter set up to amuse convalescent patients , he poured out his story to the world . He told how he had started as a telegraph operator in North Carolina , became a traveling relief agent for the Southern Railway in 1902 . A year later , he went to work in New York for the Western Union Telegraph Company ; became traveling auditor for the Central Railroad of New Jersey ; yard agent for the Delaware , Lackawanna and Western . Working at night , he enrolled at Bennett , later practiced for six months in North Carolina and returned to New York and Chicago for postgraduate work . In 1914 , he became plant surgeon for Swift and Company , in Kansas City , where he was afforded " an unparalleled opportunity for studying the diseases of animals , especially of the glandular parts of animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the army . " Due to the scarcity of Army doctors during those hectic days of 1917 , " he told his radio audience , " it became necessary to do the work ordinarily required of ten men , being on duty twentyfour hours out of the day . " This was the burden of KFKB 's earliest broadcasts to its listeners , but not the whole burden , as we shall see . But with his enemies already beginning to write a different biography , Brinkley was finding KFKB a vital mouthpiece for his own defense . The Brinkley application to practice medicine in California had been rejected by the State Medical Board after the American Medical Association made public certain facts behind Dr. Brinkley 's career . The A.M.A. revealed that Brinkley did not graduate from Bennett and that his application for a California license // listed him as attending Milton Academy , in Baltimore , during a period when one of his advertising pamphlets had him working for the Western Union Company . In that same application , he submitted a sworn statement that he was attending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from September , 1911 , to June , 1913 . The certificate submitted with the application was signed by " Dean " W. P. Sachs . But a study of the institution 's records failed to indicate Brinkley as a student during this period , and when Sachs , in turn , was bared as a diploma-mill operator , he admitted that the Brinkley certificate , dated June , 1913 , was issued in 1918 , without examination and for a cash consideration . Swift and Company 's records showed Brinkley employed as " physician and clerk " from January , 1913 , to February , the same year . His active army service was of about the same length , the War Department revealed . Sent to Fort Bliss , El Paso , Texas , as assistant to the surgeon of the 64th Infantry on June 9 , 1917 , he was transferred to Base Hospital No. 2 at Fort Bliss the next day upon his own statement that he was physically unfit for service . On August 14 ? after only thirty-one days of active service ? he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period following his discharge that he established the small hospital at Milford and performed what he later advertised as the " first goat-gland operation in the world . " During these earlier months of KFKB ( initials which Brinkley has variously asserted stood for " Kansas First , Kansas Best , " and " Kansas Folks Know Best " ) Dr. Brinkley , at frequent intervals throughout the broadcasting day , told his own story of his career . But he never forgot that his radio station had been set up to draw to his hospital and operating room in Milford patients from the aged and eternally hopeful . In this , he was enormously successful . There were no commercially sponsored programs transmitted from KFKB at this time . His verbal ? Land usually ad lib and unprepared ? defense , given in a fiery and sometimes bitterly vitriolic manner , took better than 50 per cent of the broadcast time . The remainder of the time on the air was consumed by music , played by local orchestras , and an appeal to the aged and infirm to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in de64 SOUND AND FURY fending himself against A.M.A. charges and in pointing out the benefits of his operation , Brinkley bitterly assailed organized medicine as " a monopoly against the public interest . " But when he went on the air as a medicine man seeking busitiess , his manner was sedate , dignified , almost ministerial . I have here a letter from a farmer Dr. Brinkley would say , a tiller of the soil who has given himself without stint , with his simple generosity that the great cities may live . . . . This sufferer requires an immediate operation . I suggest to him that he go to the Brinkley Hospital in Milford , Kansas , for an examination . Yet , I want this man to be confident , to be satisfied . Unless he has explicit faith in Brinkley , let him go to his own doctor or to any good hospital . . . . If you have any doubts as to the appeal of his message to men who had lost their vigor , look first at his message and then at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A man is as old as his glands , " Dr. Brinkley would tell his audience ? perhaps as large as that of any other radio station of the middle twenties . " I believe the sex glands are the master glands of the body . I believe the basis of all energy is sex energy . The first evidence of decline comes to people in decline of the sex desire or ambition . After that comes loss of energy , ambition , nervousness , insomnia , organic disfunctions of many sorts . " Here is an old trick of the medicine man : to include in the list of symptoms for which his medicine is an antidote such a wide and universal assortment of ailments that at least one of them has been suffered by the prospective customer . Who has n't suffered from one or more of the above ailments ? Now I 've found that when these folks are restored to normal sexual strength he continued they have an entirely different view of life . It becomes sweet to them again ; they want to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Contrast the castrated animal of any species with the natural male or female . Note the difference between the stallion and the gelding . Here again , Dr. Brinkley shows a consummate understanding of his rural audience from which most of his patients were gained , speaking to them in language they understand best . The stallion stands erect , neck arched , mane flowing , champing // the bit , stamping the ground , seeking the female , while the gelding stands around half asleep , going into action only when goaded , cowardly , listless , with no interest in anything . And this is the clincher ! Take man himself , castrate him , and he begins to revert to the feminine . His voice cracks , his beard disappears , his hips round and his breasts enlarge . He loses his pep and pugnacity simply because he has been deprived of his sex and energy glands . Surely these homely examples demonstrate the vast importance of the sex gland . And the Compound Operation provides a new artery and a new nerve to the depleted sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total failure , and of the thousands of our patients , I believe everyone received real and lasting benefit to a greater or less degree . From day to day , the phraseology of the Brinkley appeal would vary , but the message was always the same . Who wants to be old and sexless when a way to youth and energy lies so close at hand ? Men , some as old as eighty , rushed from all parts of the United States to Milford . William Battenfield , of Gilbert , Ark. , later testified that , during these early months of KFKB 's history , he shipped an average of forty goats a week to the hospital . Each goat represented an operation at the advertised price of $750 in advance ? or a gross return of $30,000 per week . Thus , at a period when managers of most of the nation 's radio stations were buying red ink to make ledger entries , Brinkley 's station was serving as the magnet for a new type of gold rush . Milford had changed little in size or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it boom . Brinkley erected a $25,000 Methodist Church in memory of his mother . He built a larger hospital , at a cost of $roo , 000 , and a large apartment building to house his staff . The Post Office Department found it necessary to build a new post office to handle the radio-inspired mail and to dispatch the follow-up letters scores of girls from the hospital office sent out to radio-gained prospects in the best gogetter fashion . Sewerage and electric lights in Milford were extended and Brinkley became the town 's patron saint . As for Brink-. // ley ? he bought larger diamonds , automobiles and airplanes for himself and family . Then , early in the year 1924 , the crude little transmitter which sent Brinkley 's word out through the ether waves caught fire and burned . Plans were drawn up immediately for a new and more powerful station to be erected at a cost of $65,000 . Then , with money pouring in from his surgical activities , the Brinkleys took a long trip to the Orient and on around the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offing for radio had been given broadcasters when the Communications Commission , forerunner of the FCC , banned the bitter and profane attacks upon chain stores by Colonel W. K. Henderson , from his radio station in Shreveport . And already members of the American Medical Association were speaking of taking the case of Brinkley and KFKB before that body to seek the revocation of his broadcasting license . Shrewdly , Brinkley , upon his return , moved to block such efforts . By 1925 , most of the nation 's stations had gone upon a commercial basis and were devoting much of their time to broadcasting programs sponsored by advertisers . Still Brinkley carried little of commercial broadcasts ? excepting his own ? when the new KFKB went on the air . One of the first strictly educational programs went out from there . Sam Picard , a student at Manhattan State College , in Kansas , had an idea for a University of the Air which would broadcast lectures by professors on Manhattan 's faculty . He enlisted the aid of President Jardine , of the college , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jardine was to become Secretary of Agriculture under Coolidge . So , when the Communications Commission looked at the programs of KFKB , it found that the percentage of programs ? there were other similar broadcasts ranging from book reviews to travelogues ? transmitted in the public interest at KFKB compared favorably with those of other stations . The matter of medical ethics on his programs was not gone into . But during these two years , the American Medical Association had not been idle . By 1925 , many of the states in which Brinkley had reciprocal licenses to practice had revoked those licenses . And now , the state of California ? which had rejected Brinkley 's // application for a medical license ? moved to indict him on charges of conspiracy to violate the state medical laws , succeeded in securing the indictment , but never succeeded in extraditing Brinkley from Milford to Los Angeles to stand trial . As pressure from his adversaries grew , Brinkley again went abroad , this time to Italy and to the Royal University of Pavia , where , upon presentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was awarded a degree from that ancient university . At the same time , he was also licensed to practice medicine by the London Medical Board on the strength of his American diplomas and licenses . The year 1927 was an important one for Brinkley , Milford and KFKB . In that year , Brinkley made application for an increased power for his station . A thousand-watter already , he now asked ? and received ? a license to operate under 5,000 watts . Oddly , a similar application for power increase from WDAF , owned by the Kansas City Star , was rejected . The increased power permitted Brinkley to reach an even wider audience than before over the Middle West , and as his station increased in power ? and importance ? he laid down a set of principles for it which were published and broadcast by a man who appreciated that eventually he would find himself locked in battle with an FRC which was ? though newly formed ? already extending its powers and its watchfulness over air which belonged to all the people . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a selling medium , " he proclaimed and , if you ignore the salesmanship exerted on behalf of his own hospital and , later , pharmaceutical association , this tenet was followed . Outside of a few spot commercial announcements for local merchants , KFKB carried little advertising . " KFKB shall be kept clean so that none shall be offended . The programs shall be of such a nature as to be welcomed in every home . " And , " No records shall be played . Records are cheap , but full time talent is far more valuable than its great initial outlay . " During the period from 1927 to 1930 , according to testimony later given before the FCC , KFKB had around 25 staff artists on its roster for which it paid approximately $5,000 per month . This talent consisted of singers ? cowboys , yodelers and crooners ? // a cowboy orchestra , a regular 12-piece orchestra ( for which the station paid " approximately $5o per week " ) and three announcers . It was on the air 151 hours daily . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ votes in a poll conducted by Radio Digest in 1930 was due not so much to these paid entertainers as to Dr. Brinkley 's Medical Question Box program , started in 1929 . In 1923 Brinkley began a series of lectures to expectant and new mothers . When the response proved great , Dr. Brinkley expanded the program six years later to include any medical problems which might arise . In short , listeners were invited to write in , tell Brinkley the symptoms of their illnesses and , over the air , he would tell them what to do to cure these ailments . Dr. Brinkley , through his radio Medical Question Box , was giving America wholesale medicine in 1929 boom fashion ? and as successfully as he had sold such a large segment of the " overfifty " population his goat-gland operation . His organization consisted of more than 1,500 pharmacists ? members of the Brinkley Pharmaceutical Association ? scattered widespread across the United States . When a listener would write in and describe an ailment , Dr. Brinkley , during a broadcast , would prescribe for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program for April 1 , 1930 . You are listening to Doctor Brinkley speaking from his office over station KFKB . We must dig into our question business this morning . The first question is from Somewhere in Missouri . ( Questioners often used pseudonyms ) . She says she enjoys our talks . She states her case briefly , which I appreciate . She had an operation , with her appendix , ovary and tubes removed a couple of years ago ; she is very nervous and has dizzy spells . She says the salt solution and constipation and liver medicine has already benefited her . In reply to your question No. 1 , I am more or less of the opinion that while the symptoms are to a great extent those of a premature menopause , I think they are not , but yet they are due to the fact that you have a very small amount of ovarian substance remaining . In my practice in such cases as this I have for many years used Prescription No. 61 for women . I think you should , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would go on a vegetable diet , a salt-free diet , for a while and use // Prescriptions No. 64 , 50 and 6i , you would be surprised at the benefit you would obtain . In regard to your Question No. 2 , I do n't know . None of us know . Anything I say is simply an opinion , and you will have to wait and see . . . . SUNFLOWER STATE , from Dresden , Kans . Probably he has gallstones . No , I do n't mean that , I mean kidney stones . My advice to you is to put him on Prescription No. 8o and 50 for men , also 64 . I think that he will be a whole lot better . Also drink a lot of water . Physicians of the A.M.A. were later to point out that Dr. Brinkley was suffering from a genuine doubt because the two prescriptions given in this case were ( r ) for kidney stones and ( 2 ) for gallstones . On the same broadcast , Dr. Brinkley gave this prescription to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For three months take Doctor Brinkley 's treatment for childless homes . Of course doctors say it is vulgar for me to tell you about this , but we are taking a chance and we do n't think it is obscene down here . If I can help some father and mother that do not have children in their home , to bring a little darling into their home , just one , through my suggestions , I will take all the cussings and a lot more than I have already taken from my ethical friends . If this lady will take Nos. 50 and 61 and that good old standby of mine , No. 67 , for about three months , and see if there is n't a great big change taking place . Do n't have an operation . A much discussed Brinkley prescription was given to an Olathe ( Kans. ) woman whose difficulty lay not in childlessness , but in overfruitfulness . By way of the radio , Dr. Brinkley advised her : " I suggest that you have your husband sterilized and then you will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in anybody else 's cow pasture and get in with some other bull . " It 's easy to understand why such a spicy program ? quite aside from its appeal to those genuinely concerned about their health ? should enjoy a vast listening audience . And KFKB was fast becoming the most listened-to station in the Middle West . The income for KFKB during the months of February , March // and April , 1930 ? as reported to the FCC by station auditors ? is significantly broken down into these divisions : Disbursements for the same period amounted to $33,483.67 . Throughout Kansas , Nebraska , Missouri and Oklahoma , physi cians ? and particularly those practicing in small towns and rural areas ? helplessly watched their patients drift away . When farm hands became ill , they no longer called the local doctor , they wrote to Brinkley 's radio station . Also , other radio stations in the area ? whose source of income had been augmented by patent medicine accounts ? began to find these budgets sadly curtailed , when patent medicine sales took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by newspapers and to the already raised voice of the embattled A.M.A. was added the bitter , con demnatory voice of the press . Particularly was the voice of the Kansas City Star raised in indignant protest against the " nefarious " activities of the " Milford Messiah . " The American Medical Association , under guidance of Dr. Morris Fishbein , continued to fight . Facts connected with Brink ley 's medical education were placed before the medical boards of the various states in which he was still permitted to practice , before the faculty of the University of Pavia , the London Medi cal Board . Quickly , Brinkley 's diplomas and licenses began to melt away under the onslaught . Brinkley fought back wrathfully via his radio station . He called the American Medical Association a " meat cutters ' union , " and referred to Dr. Fishbein as " Fishy . " His was a sardonic and , fortunately , rare sense of humor . Both in his authorized biography and on broadcasts , he gleefully recounted his first goat-gland operations and told how ? before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his operations ? he had successfully rejuvenated a pair of patients from California only to find that , after a few days , they exuded the peculiar and distinctive goat odor from their per-sons ! Later , while running for governor of Kansas , he encountered the bitter pen of William Allen White . Undismayed , Brinkley expressed a crated goat to America 's best known and beloved country editor . The foul-smelling animal , in his crate , occupied a corner of the small editorial office through the better part of a warm summer day until one of the reporters found a boy who was willing to accept it as a gift . The Kansas City Star , aware of the close supervision being given broadcasts by the FRC , concentrated its attacks upon Brink-ley in the columns of its newspaper , ignoring him on its radio station . Star editors put their ace reporter , A. B. MacDonald , on the Brinkley case . Early in 1930 , MacDonald wrote , in an in terview with Brinkley published in the Star : ... I began mentally to weigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the biggest , the one in his necktie , the one set in a ring of platinum on a finger of his right hand or the one on his left hand . They glittered as he moved , and my decision was that the one in his tie , as large as a hazel nut , had it over the other two . .. . Diamonds , travel , a yacht for summer cruises , a cabin plane with a full-time pilot ? all these cost money . To find where it came from in 1930 one had only to tune in radio station KFKB . In between the broadcast answers to his critics , the cowboy band , the yodelers , Brinkley issued his clarion call to the aged . And now about wives , Brinkley would say . ) Do n't get the impres sion that women are icebergs and are content with impotent husbands . I know of more families where the devil is to pay in fusses and tem peramental sprees all due to the husband not being able to function properly . Many and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor , my husband is no good . .. . Now this operation , which I call " Compound Operation , " consists of adding a new artery and nerve to the patient 's own sex glands . . . which act as a charger . . . . My batting average is high . That is what // counts . Well , what is my average ? Oh , about 90 to 95 per cent ! How 's that ? But already in the spring of 1930 , the Federal Radio Commission was being flooded with complaints ? result of those campaigns waged by the A.M.A. and the Kansas City Star ? against Brinkley 's air activities . On May 21 , 1930 , the FRC summoned Brinkley to appear before it and show cause why his license to operate KFKB should not be revoked . Guiding dictum of the commission in issuing licenses is that stations be operated " in the public interest , necessity and convenience . " Three charges had been brought against KFKB . First , that it had deviated from its assigned wave length ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the radio ; and , finally , that his answers to patients in the Medical Question Box program were contrary to the public interest . Testifying on behalf of Brinkley at the hearing were a number of his satisfied patients who said they had traveled to Washington at their own expense to defend their benefactor . On the other side of the table , Dr. Hugh H. Young , of Johns Hopkins University and Hospital , expressed his opinion that the practice of prescribing wholesale and by radio was highly dangerous . " Personally , " he said , " I would never be willing to send out prescriptions or to make a diagnosis on any such information as that ( contained in the letters from lay listeners ) without examination and without a study of the case other than the opinion of a person who knew no medicine himself or herself . I would think that such a practice carried out by broadcasting would be of the greatest possible danger . " The hearing continued for three days with attention centered only upon the last of the three charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public interest . " Brinkley 's staff was called one by one , and medical and technical authorities gathered by the FRC testified in rebuttal . Significant was the presence of Dr. E. S. Edgerton , Wichita , Kans. , president of the Kansas State Medical Society . Later , upon invitation of the Commission , // Dr. Edgerton took the stand , testified against Brinkley . Brinkley was represented by his counsel , refused to testify himself . At the end of three days , the commission voted three to two not to renew Dr. Brinkley 's license to broadcast in the United States . In addition to the testimony of medical experts that the Medical Question Box was dangerous and decidedly not in the public interest , the commission considered also the treaty signed at the International Radiotelegraph Convention of 1927 which prohibited licensees from making point-to-point broadcasts and decided " that is of itself abuse of KFKB 's license to broadcast sufficient to warrant refusal to renew that license . " For answers to the questions sent in were broadcast directly to the individual questioner and constituted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the man who , perhaps , more than any other , foresaw the great potentialities of radio as an advertising medium should now be ignominiously silenced by what the FRC termed his misuse of radio . And because the Brinkley power , of late , had been builded so entirely upon radio , the blow was a devastating one . Immediately , Brinkley filed an appeal from the commission 's verdict in the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia , and posted bond which permitted him to continue his broadcasts from KFKB until the court passed upon his appeal . But still another blow was on the way . At about the time Brinkley was preparing his case for the FRC hearing on renewal of his license application , Dr. Morris Fishbein , editor of the A.M.A. 's Journal , had written a damning article about Brinkley and his activities . Now Brinkley filed suit against Dr. Fishbein , asking $600,000 damages for libel and defamation of character . He fol lowed the suit with a full-page advertisement in a number of news-papers under the headline of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this advertisement , he asserted that none of his doctors could belong to the A.M.A. because " in our institution we devote our efforts to curing our patients and not to covering up mistakes of malpracticing members of your association . " He issued a ringing challenge to the A.M.A. to come out into the open . Nine days later , the A.M.A. did come out into the open . It filed formal charges with the Kansas State Medical Board , in Topeka , asking the revocation of Brinkley 's license in that ? the // only ? state where he still held a license . Specifically , the A.M.A. charged that he had given false information as to his educational background ; that he had pleaded guilty to selling liquor and maintaining a public nuisance ; that he had been put under bond to keep the peace after threatening to shoot one Jesse Wilson ; that he had been indicted in California ; that his compound goat-gland operation can not be performed in the manner described by him and that it is a fraud and deception upon the public ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old fools " for coming to him in the hope that their diseases can be cured ; that a number of his patients have died in the hospital after his operation ; and that his radio-advertising practices were unethical . The hearing before the State Medical Board opened on July 15 , 1930 , after Brinkley 's attorneys had vainly gone before the Kansas Supreme Court in an effort to halt this " crucifixion " before a " prejudiced board . " Again , testimony , affidavits , bitter recrimination and vitriolic cross-examination . But the dramatic high light of the proceedings was provided by Brinkley . While members of the A.M.A. were stoutly maintaining that the operation could not be performed in the manner in which Dr. Brinkley advertised , Brinkley , through the press and the radio , challenged the board to come to his hospital at Milford and witness such an operation . It was impossible for the board to refuse . On September 15 , 1930 , before the State Medical Board , a large group of newspapermen and members of the medical faculty of the University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two patients . One member of the board later told this writer that , while it was very doubtful that the goat-gland operation would prove of the least benefit to the recipient , the operation itself was as skillful and deft a demonstration of surgery as he had ever witnessed . It should have been ; Brinkley had performed it thousands of times . The board went back to Topeka , back into executive session in the Hotel Kansan where the earlier hearings had been held , and revoked the license of John Romulus Brinkley . For a man of less hardy spirit , these two blows ? falling almost simultaneously ? would have been sufficient . But whatever // other charges one cares to bring against Brinkley , cowardice is not among them . And where before , only a comparatively few people gave second thought to the activities of Brinkley , now he had become truly a national figure . In Kansas , he was more than that . There , Dr. Brinkley had become a martyr . And Brinkley , with his finger as closely upon the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a patient , sensed the new possibilities of the situation . First , in order to keep the funds rolling into his treasury , he placed properly accredited and licensed surgeons in his sanatorium at Milford to carry on his work . And again a new ? yet old ? pattern was beginning to take form in the fertile brain of the promoter-physician . Old as mankind is the practice of border raiding ; so , if the United States would not permit Brinkley to broadcast to Americans from within her bounds ? and he had no illusions about the verdict the District of Columbia appeals court would hand down in the case of KFKB 's license ? then he would broadcast to Americans from without her bounds . This was possible because of the strained ether-relations of the United States and Mexico . In early days , each nation had a sovereign right to control its own air waves and broadcasts . Soon , however , neighbor nations learned that unless these rights were abridged by treaty , stations of one nation broadcasting along the same channels as stations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1924 , Canada and the United States had agreed by treaty to divide and share certain channels so that interference would be eliminated . Mexico was the third great country of the Western Hemisphere to come into the broadcasting picture ? but her entry was late in the twenties , when the best radio channels had been taken already by Canada and the United States . Broadcasting in 1930 was big business , and operators of important stations in Canada and the United States refused to share their valuable channels . So , treaty agreements with Mexico reached a conference-table stage but went no farther . Moving rapidly while his adversaries were congratulating themselves upon a job well done , Brinkley went down to Mexico City , // signed a twenty-year agreement with the Mexican Government for a permit to build a transmitter at Villa Acuna , just across the Rio Grande from the Texas town of Del Rio . Here he started construction of what was , at that time , the most powerful transmitter in the world ? XER . With his 5,000-watt KFKB , Dr. Brinkley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With the 1oo,000-watt XER , he would be able to blanket the entire United States and Canada . And with construction well under way , he hurried back to Milford for a daring surprise stroke . He announced himself as candidate for governor of Kansas on an independent ticket . It was already too late to have his name printed upon the ballot , but he conducted a whirlwind campaign , flying from county to county and town to town in his plane . KFKB , still operating until the courts had passed upon his appeal , was also opened wide to Brinkley 's political orations , and he used the radio mercilessly in his campaign to educate his followers to write in his name correctly upon the ballot . He sought at the polls vindication " as a man persecuted like Christ and St. Luke . " He promised free textbooks , low taxes and a lake for every Kansas county . He spoke to 8,000 cheering followers in a cow pasture at Wichita . At Kansas City , he drew a crowd twice as large as Vice-President Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brinkley attracted the Methodist vote and that of the Ku Klux Klan by virtue of his large church benefactions at Milford . His role of martyr drew him thousands of other votes , to which radio added countless more thousands . He also received the wide support of the Kansas discontents , who , more than in any other state , have supported the Populists , Carrie Nations and other strange phenomena of the socio-political order . The New York Times editorialized : In Kansas politics forty years ago , the political uprising that threatened went under the name of Populism . It grew from the grass roots and acquired its leadership as it grew larger . The only difference today is that it goes under the name of Brinkleyism and has been cultivated among the grass roots . The conditions causing the people to be dissatisfied are very much the same ? high taxes , low // prices for agricultural products and a belief that the party leadership has deteriorated . Long before election day , old-line Democrats and Republicans began to realize that the goat-gland man they had laughingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next governor of Kansas . They hurriedly sent out instructions to the various election boards that , unless the ballot on which Brinkley 's name was written in had the name correctly and flawlessly spelled ; unless it bore the full and complete designation , " John R. Brinkley " ( under which he had registered ) , the ballots were to be thrown out . Day after election , conservative Kansans breathed a deep sigh of relief . The official vote showed Harry Woodring , Democrat and later to serve as Secretary of War under Roosevelt , had been elected with a vote of 216,000 ; Frank Hauke , Republican , was second , with 214,000 votes ; and Brinkley was third with 183,000 votes . The most biased old-line party leaders in Kansas today will admit that , if all the ballots intended for Brinkley , but thrown out for technical reasons , had been counted , Brinkley would have been governor of Kansas in 1930 . And that with a write-in vote for a name not on the ballot ! In February , 1930 , the courts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's license to broadcast from KFKB , and Brinkley sold the station to the Farmers and Bankers Life Insurance Company , of Wichita , for the sum of $90,000 . The glories of the Brinkley operation ( in which he no longer used goat glands but had substituted a chemical formula in combination with surgery ) poured in alike upon the ears of Canadian trappers and tropical banana planters from his transmitter in Mexico , now . Often , too , in these broadcasts , the exiled Milford Messiah dropped hints to worry the Kansas politicians . My dear , dear friends , my patients , my many supplicants . Your letters ? hundreds of them since yesterday ? lie here before me , touching testimonials of your pain , your grief , the wretchedness which is visited upon the innocent . I can reply now to a few ? just a few . Others I shall answer by mail . But oh , my friends , you must remember that your letters asking my advice in your physical suffer78 SOUND AND FURY ings must be accompanied by two dollars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , office rent and so forth . I am your friend , but not even the greatest Baron of Wall Street ? Wall Street , where the untold millions of money are ? could withstand the ruinous cost of helping you unless this small fee accompanies your letter . ... My dear friends , I wish that I were near to you tonight ? in my home in Milford , Kansas ? but I am down here speaking from my new radio broadcasting station at Villa Acuna . . . But I shall be back with you again , my dear , dear friends . . . . And in 1932 , Dr. Brinkley was back , again a candidate for the office of governor of the state of Kansas . This time , without a radio station at his command , he used a motorcade headed by his sixteen-cylinder Cadillac in which he , his wife and Johnny Boy , his son , rode . A big loud-speaker platform truck , with equipment capable of throwing a speaker 's voice a half mile , followed with cowboy singers and entertainers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off oldline politicians , polling 243,038 votes this time , while Alf M. Landon , later to be Republican standard bearer in the Presidential race of 1936 , was elected with a vote of 275,100 . Unusual fact about this election was that Brinkley had carried more counties than either of his opponents , and he used this fact in protesting that he had been robbed of votes in the heavy population centers . When Brinkley went back to Villa Acuna , there was no longer even the semblance of an effort to maintain a broadcasting station " in the public interest . " Koran 's fortune-telling scheme ; the sale of stock in a gold mine ; oil burner sales announcements ; even standard patent medicine advertisements shared time with his new prostate-gland lectures and his old rejuvenation comeons . XER was following , more and more , the lines of least resistance . In the wake of Brinkley came a whole raft of radio racketeers ? phrenologists and fortunetellers , yogis and mentalists , character readers and false-faced religionists with a single purpose ? to milk the gullible of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plague of these get-rich-quick quacks until the FRC put its foot firmly down upon such broadcasts . The commission was aided in this by a watchful Post Office Department , averse to having its facilities used for fraudulent purposes . When these programs could no longer find voice over American stations , their sponsors , too , drifted southward to Mexico , which rapidly became the mecca for every type of broadcaster kicked off the American air . On March 29 , 1941 , radio stations of the Western Hemisphere underwent what broadcasters termed its " moving day . " Of 833 commercial stations in the United States , 755 could no longer be found at their old addresses . In short , the channels over which these stations had been broadcasting ? some since 192o ? had been changed . Reason for the change was Mexico 's final ratification late in 1940 of the Treaty of Havana , drawn up and signed in 1937 by Cuba , Canada and the United States . This meant a wholesale reallocation of wave lengths for American stations ; and it was a death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had dotted the southern bank of the Rio Grande and harried American broadcasters by transmitting along the same channels American stations were legally licensed to use . Like other parasites , the border raiders lived upon food already digested by their victims . They could not earn their bread unless they were permitted to broadcast their come-ons into the ether waves over the United States . And like other parasites , they died when that privilege was taken away from them . In February , 1941 , on his own petition to the Federal District Court of San Antonio , Texas , John Romulus Brinkley was adjudged a bankrupt . In the testimony given at his hearing , he admitted that he had operated upon 15,000 patients between 1933 and 1938 ? not nearly peak years ? and received for most of these operations a fee of $750 each . He listed his liabilities at $1,625 , - 565 ; assets at $221,065 , of which much was in personal property ? automobiles , a yacht , an outdated cabin plane . Chapter Five SEEDS OF AMERICAN FASCISM IF THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and subsequent oblivion , his niche in broadcasting annals would be a minor one . But while Brinkley had faded from the radio scene , the pattern of broadcasting he formulated in those early years of commercial radio was destined to play an important ? almost a vital ? part in our national life . For there were inheritors to take on the Brinkley mantle and , beside them , the Goat-Gland Doctor from Milford seems a piker . Make no mistake , Father Charles E. Coughlin and the late Huey Long were playing a dangerous game and they played for keeps . The Fascist revolt they headed in the early months of 1935 might have been disastrous to the American way of life had not fate , in the form of an assassin 's bullet , intervened . There have been two periods in recent American history when the seeds of Fascism have been scattered widely across the land to fall upon fallow ground . The first of these periods coincides with the last two years of the Hoover Administration when a government unwilling or unable to act watched despair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agricultural countryside alike . Fortunately , the very first essential of a successful Fascist revolt in that period was missing . There was no demagogue of sufficient stature and voice to lead a revolt , and when the Democratic Convention met in Chicago in the heat of the summer and nominated Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt , of New York , for the Presidency , the seeds of Fascism lay barren and fruitless beneath his eloquence and the promise he held out of a New Deal for the forgotten man . The second period when a Fascist revolt might have flared into 8o // the open in the United States came two years later , when the original impetus and lift of the New Deal had run its course and a period of reaction , called " Recession " by Mr. Roosevelt , had set in . By a wise use of the media of information ? radio and press ? during the early months of his first term , the President had restored confidence and allied the various factions of the country in a brave struggle upward out of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " All that we have to fear , " he assured America in his dulcet baritone voice and Groton English , " is fear . " America 's response is already history . Confident that the New Deal would bring about a more equitable distribution of economic power , Americans voted Mr. Roosevelt more power than any peacetime President had ever had . Yet , in 1934 , the unemployment rolls were growing ; the Supreme Court had dealt severe body blows to the President 's program by declaring keystone measures of the New Deal unconstitutional ; and Big Business ? which had feared for its very existence in 1932 and supported the New Deal as its sole means of salvation ? had now turned against it in full fury . By 1934 , Big Business had adjusted itself to the depression and was actually making money out of it . In 1934 , dividends were 50 per cent above the 1926 level . But , pay rolls in 1934 were 40 per cent below the 1926 level . As a result , the middle classes and labor demanded action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were concerned , was almost as dire as in 1932 . In this crisis , Mr. Roosevelt faltered . Just as in 1932 , the stage for revolt was set , but this time there was an important difference . Now there was not one demagogue capable of leading such a revolt ( and by revolt , I do not necessarily mean a physical revolt ) but two . To add to the peril of the situation , the two ? Huey Long , now a United States Senator , and Father Coughlin ? had joined forces to this end . The road to Fascism in America was marked by thousands of Huey Long " Share-the-Wealth " clubs , sprung up overnight across the country . So , the road to Fascism in Germany had been marked by the promises of Hitler to right the wrongs done Germany by the Versailles Treaty . The Coughlin panaceas were of the same visionary pattern . A sign of the tunes ? and a red light of // danger ? was the fact that either Long or Coughlin , in that period , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States with a family income under $4,000 per year ! At a banquet given him by Redbook magazine in 1935 , General Hugh S. Johnson said : You can laugh at Huey Long ? You can snort at Father Coughlin , but this country was never under a greater menace . . . . Added to the fol-de-rol of Senator Long , there comes burring over the air the dripping brogue of the Irish-Canadian priest .. musical , blatant bunk from the very rostrum of religion , it goes straight home to simple souls weary in distress . We can neither revere nor respect what appears to be a priest in Holy Orders entering our homes . . . in the name of Jesus Christ , demanding that we ditch the President for Huey Long .. . . On the Sunday before , Coughlin had definitely allied himself with the Long movement , saying that the Long program offefed more for the " plain folk " of America than that of the President . Between the team of Huey Long and the priest Johnson continued ) , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . possessed by Peter , the Hermit , Napoleon Bonaparte , Sitting Bull , William Hohenzollern , Hitler , Lenin . . . boiled down to two with the radio and the newsreel to make them effective . If you do n't think Long and Coughlin are dangerous , you do n't know the temper of the country in this distress ! Far from accomplishing its purpose of spiking the CoughlinLong guns by pointing out their Fascist dangers , the Johnson damnation served only to focus the national spotlight more strongly upon the demagogic pair . They were important national figures before , but Johnson 's broadcast served as a formal induction into that status . Next day , Long answered on the floor of the Senate Chamber . The galleries were jam-packed , as they always were when Long was expected to speak . He struck at Johnson through Baruch , Johnson 's boss during World War days , calling Johnson a man of " voluble loyalties . " // But his real attack was leveled at the Roosevelt Administration , and it was made that night over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large networks . Broadcasting executives recognized showmanship when they saw it , and this threecornered battle between the country 's outstanding masters of invective out-shaded any studio spectacle they might concoct . Even before the Johnson attack , Senator Long had been averaging three nationwide broadcasts every two weeks on facilities furnished him without charge , while most members of the Senate would have been grateful for one hour per year free . " So it has been , " he told the estimated more than twenty million pairs of ears tuned to his voice , " that while millions have starved and gone naked ; so it has been that while babies have cried and died for lack of milk . . . the Roosevelt Administration has sailed merrily along plowing under and destroying the things to eat and wear . . . . " It had been conceded that Long would be a candidate for the Democratic nomination for the Presidency in 1936 . Now he gave a clue to the rabble-rousing type of campaign he would wage . He called upon the people to wage a class war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the populace . " Let 's make the fight ! Let 's make the politician keep his promise or else vote into office somebody who will keep the promise that in this land of abundance , none shall have too much and none shall have too little ! " At the time that General Johnson was blasting away , Father Coughlin , ill of a cold in Royal Oak , was sleeping comfortably . But the next day , rising from his sickbed and without waiting for his regular Sunday broadcast , the priest made his answer , too . He disposed of Johnson with a few scathing phrases . . . A cracked gramophone record squawking out messages of its master 's voice . . . . The first great casualty of the New Deal experiment . " But , like Long , he leveled the big guns of his attack on Bernard Baruch . " Bernard Manasseh Baruch , " he said , " is another Manasseh like the prince of that name who sawed the body of the Prophet Isaiah in twain . " He made much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle name a deep secret from the public until now . As a matter of record , Baruch 's middle name is Mannes . Facts have never bothered Father Coughlin . Then he ended his broadcast with the first indication of racial prejudice ever to creep into a Coughlin broadcast . " I shall fight to my dying day to hand America back to Americans ! " The dangers inherent in our free system of broadcasting are simply the dangers inherent in the principle of free speech ? but multiplied many times by the immeasurable reach of radio . Nor have these dangers been better exemplified than in the hydraheaded assault upon freedom and democratic principles by the Coughlin-Long combine . Both Coughlin and Long were products of radio , Coughlin solely so and Long to a large extent . Without radio , it is unlikely that Coughlin 's voice would ever have been heard and heeded beyond the confines of his minor parish . Huey Long was different . He possessed natural qualities of leadership and a bluff , earthy manner of stump speaking few figures in public life have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to Long 's bitter enemy , Lieutenant Governor Dr. Paul N. Cyr , once told the writer and other newsmen and magazine writers : " Huey Long is the best political radio speaker in America , better even than President Roosevelt . Give him time on the air and a week to campaign in each state , and he 'll sweep the country . He is the most persuasive man living . " Long , himself , gave radio full credit for its part in his successes . " The blankety-blank newspapers , " he growled to me once during an interview , " used to have things their own way once . But no more . Radio 's changed that . " And in 1926 , before he had learned this lesson , he went down to a one-sided defeat in his race for the governorship because the press opposed him . In 1928 , with radio to carry his silver-lined campaign pledges into every home , he won in a walk ; and one of his first acts as governor of Louisiana was to instruct the legislature to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of punishment . Americans complacently feel that Fascism is something that can grow only in foreign soil . . . or in Louisiana , where Long frequently asserted ( with excellent reason ) that " I am the constiSEEDS // tution here ! " In 1933 , few realized how serious a situation was developing at breakneck speed , and today , there is even less understanding of how perilously close we walked at that time to the peoples of Germany and Italy in our choice . Raymond Gram Swing , a most conservative observer , writing in the Nation , in the summer of 1935 , had this to say : A few months ago , Huey Long was a myth to most Americans , but by Spring he was one of the most-mentioned men in the country . This has been distinctly " his " year . Everything broke for him . It saw the inexplicable collapse of the New Deal , the mysterious failure in leadership at the White House , the breakdown of the huge Democratic majority in the Senate . Had Roosevelt maintained the pace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained clamoring on the outside for entrance to the national stage . But when Huey pushed against the Roosevelt defenses , they yielded . The Senate became his personal arena . He had mastered its tricks , and he could fight with every conceivable parliamentary device . . . . The Senate majority began going to pieces ; it was Long who contrived many of the intrigues which shattered it . Suddenly , without premonition , the man was a power . He could stretch out his elbows , fill his lungs ; no one silenced him or could silence him . He was leader of the opposition to the President in the upper house . Concurrently , he received invitations to broadcast over the nation 's hook-ups . . . . He was news , he was entitled to the air . And at the microphone , he began acquainting the whole nation with his curiously effective radio presence ... . By the summer of 1935 , Long had developed into a man to watch . His " Share-the-Wealth " clubs , organized with the averred intention of " making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimum income of $5,000 a year , had sprung up in more than 8,00o cities , towns and villages with club memberships ranging from three to 2,000 members for a total membership of close to 20,000,000 . Add to these the 16,000,000 followers of Father Coughlin , thrown into the Long camp the March before , and you understand that what happened in Louisiana might well have been but a dress rehearsal of things to come for the nation . // The Coughlin-Long movement , brought definitely out into the open by the Johnson radio attack , gained momentum throughout the summer of 1935 with the Thunderer of Royal Oak ( also known to those in his home parish of Royal Oak , Michigan , as the " Mad Monk of the Shrine of the Silver Dollar " ) pounding away at growing radio audiences . His position was further fortified by the establishment of his ironically named Social justice magazine . Long spent the summer touring the country and building more and better political fences through personal appearances . He spoke , during that summer , four times over large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in various cities . Then , late in August , he returned to Baton Rouge ? his own little Berchtesgaden , surrounded on three sides by Democracy and , on the fourth , appropriately , by the turbulent Mexican Gulf . On September 8 , I interviewed Long as he lay , in blue pajamas , on a downy bed in a luxurious suite of a Baton Rouge hotel . He assured me that " the President was a back number " and that the next election would find a new horseman in the saddle . I spent more than an hour with him while bodyguards lurked outside the door , and , during moments of silence , peeked in suspiciously despite the fact that they had searched me carefully before permitting me to enter . Two members of the state legislature also came to the room during that hour , received instructions , nodded and departed . Two days later , I was walking within two blocks of the capitol when a noise as of a car backfiring split the quiet . Suddenly everyone started running and the whisper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wildfire through the streets . I rushed to the capitol , tall tower by the Mississippi which will always seem to me a personal monument to Huey Long ; and from its terrace , now jammed with people , I could see the shanty-boats , with their penniless occupants , moored almost within stone 's throw of its entrance . Later , I talked with some of them , and they were like mourners for a departed God or , more important , like men who have lost a new-found world . By the time I had elbowed my way through the throng , Long had been removed , but the body of his hapless assassin ? Dr. // Carl A. Weiss ? lay in the corridor still , covered with a piece of tarpaulin . State troopers moved busily about , and the bloodstains , still unwashed , marked the spot where Huey had fallen . And as I stood there staring at this spot , I had the awesome , unshakable feeling that the hand of God had been in that corridor this day ; that I had missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a man who , but for the hand of the assassin . . . or God . . . might have become the first dictator of America . . . . Huey Long made his entrance into the realm of politics as a lad of fourteen , in 1907 , at the time he was running the Southern Sentinel , a weekly newspaper in Winnfield , Louisiana . For the sum of five dollars on the line , he undertook to manage the campaign of a fellow townsman for the job of tick inspector for the parish . One of the speeches Huey wrote for his candidate is still considered the last word in that sort of thing down in those parts , and many feel that he never succeeded in improving upon it in later years . The last paragraph contained this pledge : " If I 'm elected , I will inspect every last cow , male and female , for ticks . Them that 's got ' em will git rid of ' em , and them that ai n't got none wo n't get none ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiplied his powers a thousandfold . In 1926 , without radio , he ran a poor race for the governorship ; but by 1928 , he had studied and mastered radio as a political weapon . He would start his talks with an effective , audience-building entree . Hello , folks , this is Huey Long speaking . And I have some important things to tell you . Before I begin , I want you to do me a favor . I 'm going to talk along four or five minutes just to keep things going . While I 'm doing it , I want you to go to the telephone and call up five of your friends and tell them Huey Long is on the air . Later , he used the same technique in his national broadcasts , and because radio audiences had come to look for the unexpected and the bizarre in any Long broadcast after his election to the Senate , the device was even more important in the national arena // than in Louisiana . Radio listeners recognized in him a remarkable broadcaster . His style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the uneducated man . He quoted Scripture as no northern political orator has quoted it for a generation . Religious listeners were impressed and Huey Long pleased the plain people more than any other who came bearing , if not gifts , then the gilded promise of gifts . Those in the North who were not lured by his promises were misled into dismissing him as a clown . They had no true understanding of his talents and of his almost unbeatable mass appeal . Politicians of Arkansas , however , were under no such misapprehension . When Mrs. Hattie Caraway entered the primary to succeed her late husband in the United States Senate , she was generally expected to run last among the five candidates . Huey took his sound-van into Arkansas on Mrs. Caraway 's behalf , spent six days covering a small part of the state and made two radio appeals . Mrs. Caraway won by a majority over the combined opposition ? and an analysis of the vote showed that the districts where Huey appeared or talked by radio gave her a landslide ; other districts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your viewpoint , more or less fortunate than the ill-fated Huey . Where Huey met both his political and physical end in one sudden volley from a hidden revolver , Father Coughlin has died , politically , twice since then . The first occasion was the defeat of his substitute-for-Long candidate in the 1936 Presidential election . Committed to an against-Roosevelt movement , the priest plopped for Farm-Laborite William Lemke so hard and in such positive tones that the outcome of the election and the burial of the said Mr. Lemke , Coughlin label and all , under the avalanche of Roosevelt votes , marked the Royal Oak prophet for oblivion . Coughlin was effective as a collaborator of the Kingfish ; he was n't big enough to stand on his own two feet . Huey was a doer ; Coughlin was simply a talker . And Lemke was n't either . The second occasion when Coughlin became one with those for whom the bell tolls was the National Association of Broadcasters convention , three years later , in Atlantic City . // The convention , in an effort to stave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted a code , one clause of which prohibited members from broadcasting over their radio stations political and economic talks by speakers wearing an ecclesiastical false face . In short , no longer could Father Coughlin come into American homes through the facilities of the leading broadcasting stations of the land " in the name of Jesus Christ and wearing what appeared to be Holy Orders " to disseminate his philosophy of hate and intolerance , plagiarized in so many instances from the utterances of the Nazi propaganda minister , Paul Goebbels . The result was a greatly curtailed Coughlin network ? in fact a network so negligible in its effectiveness that the priest was forced to an antic more ridiculous than any ever dreamed up by Huey in his heyday . Prominently posted on the wall of the waiting room at WJR , Detroit 's " Good Will " station , is a beautifully framed code of ethics which reads , in part , as follows : ... We recognize that the radio audience includes persons of all ages and all types of political , social and religious belief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any matter which would commonly be regarded as offensive . . . and exert every effort that no dishonest , fraudulent or dangerous person may gain access to the radio public ... . Father Coughlin 's Sunday talks originated from WJR and there , on February 4 , 1940 , originated as weird a piece of radio broadcasting as ever went out over the air waves ( not excepting Orson Welles 's " Mars " episode , which was a purely unintentional pandemonium raiser ) . That night , as Coughlin followers were gathered about their radios in anticipation of the weekly talk , Franklin Mitchell , Coughlin announcer , exhorted them to " call all your friends by telephone and tell them to listen to this program ! " A musical interlude followed . Then the announcer stepped back to the microphone . And now for the first significant announcement : I am instructed to say , " Father Coughlin will not address you today . No person will ad90 SOUND AND FURY dress you today over this microphone . I am not authorized to give any explanation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructed to say , " Pay no heed to idle rumors which will be circulated this week . Be assured Father Coughlin knows what he is doing . He knows why neither he nor any other person is speaking over this microphone today . Probably events transpiring this week will enlighten you . " But no events transpiring that week ? or since ? have cast light upon the intriguing and mysterious performance . When the week had passed , Father Coughlin returned to the microphone to give an innocuous talk on the annual report of the National Catholic Welfare Conference . He made no mention of the mysterious proceedings of the week before . The next Sunday , he spoke on the meaning of Lent . Still no mention . The only event transpiring which might have had a bearing upon the case was the announcement of the United States Department of Justice that it planned to investigate the Coughlin activities . Rumors flew back and forth , the most persistent being that he had planned a violent attack upon the Justice Department and had been muzzled . Other rumors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had refused to give it , as well as that the network had refused to permit the talk he planned to make that night . All of these reports are false . Investigating them I went to Detroit for a talk with the priest . I called first at WJR , where I talked with Assistant General Manager Owen F. Uridge in the absence of General Manager Leo Fitzpatrick . I learned from Mr. Uridge that Father Coughlin had submitted his script two days before the broadcast ? as was his custom ? and that Mr. Fitzpatrick 's secretary had read and approved it . Later , on Sunday morning , Father Coughlin had called for the return of the script . " The announcements made on that program , " Mr. Uridge said , " were handed direct to the announcer by Father Coughlin . " Thus , Mr. Uridge 's statements finally set aside any possibility that Father Coughlin 's planned talk had been censored off the air either by WJR or the network carrying it . They // also show that Father Coughlin was in Detroit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one at the station would comment on the canceled talk beyond indicating that there was nothing of a harmful or argumentative nature in it . So , I crossed the street to visit with a Mr. Gibson of Aircasters , Inc. , the agency which handles the Coughlin broadcasts . " You understand , " Mr. Gibson made it perfectly clear , " that we have nothing to do with Father Coughlin . We just handle his account like we do any others . " But I finally managed to persuade Gibson to call Miss Rhodes , Father Coughlin 's secretary , to arrange an appointment for me with the priest . I went to the Shrine of the Little Flower , fifteen miles out in Royal Oak . Under the tower of the shrine ? and after considerable searching ? I found the offices of the Social Justice Publishing Company . Father Coughlin has often asserted , in defending himself against use of his clerical position in politics , that the publishing company has no connection with the shrine . There were no signs directing pilgrims to these basement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably have had as difficult a time finding them as I had . The outer office is a heavily barred , fortresslike room , and a girl , busy sealing hundreds of newly mimeographed letters , paused long enough to ask me what I wanted . I explained that I had an appointment with Miss Rhodes and wanted to see Father Coughlin . The girl talked into the phone , finally said : " She says to tell you that Father Coughlin is out of the city . " So I walked over to the little house which , unlike the Social Justice offices , is clearly and unmistakably marked , " Souvenirs . " Inside on a table were things to sell ? countless little anti-Semitic pamphlets under labels like , " Am I an Anti-Semite ? " by Father Coughlin ; " The Real Rulers in Russia , " and latest copies of Social Justice magazine bearing a large picture of Abraham Lincoln and a paragraph from John Reeves 's biography of the Rothschilds , horribly misquoted and twisted in the Social Justice version to prove that the Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white-haired keeper of the souvenir shop did n't know where Father Coughlin was , did n't know anything about his // business . Finally , his curiosity bursting all bounds , he asked me " Who you representing ? " I told him . " I do n't know nothing , " he repeated doggedly . I 'll say this for Father Coughlin 's employees ; they 're discreet . Perhaps they have to be discreet to stay on at the shrine . I called at the Chancellery , and to church officials there , explained what I was seeking and gave a detailed recital of the morning 's occurrences . " You 'll understand , then , " they smiled , " why the Chancellery issues no statements about Father Coughlin . " I asked whether the Church had censored any parts of the Coughlin talk which did n't come off . Very pointedly they admitted that a Church board of review does pass on the Coughlin talks , BUT only for matters which concern the Church . Two of the three possible sources of censorship had now been eliminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body could possibly have interfered with the broadcast , the Federal Communications Commission . In reply to a telegram George B. Coleman , assistant counsel for the commission , replied , " I have no hesitancy in speaking for the Commission when I say that no Federal intervention has occurred . " That left only one other possibility ? Fathcr Coughlin , himself . Father Coughlin , by his every word and act , admits ambition . Once his ambition was to be known as the maker ? and intimate friend ? of Presidents . In 1932 , no louder voice was raised ' on behalf of Roosevelt than that of Coughlin . His talks following the election were filled with " what I said to the President and what the President said to me . " He fancied himself a Richelieu or a Savonarola . Then something happened . The same voice that shouted , " Roosevelt or Ruin ! " was now shouting " Scab President ! " and referring to the President as " that great betrayer and liar , Franklin Doublecross Roosevelt . " In the Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of difficulty . Father Coughlin took to the air . " The restoration of silver to its proper value is a Christian concern , " Father Coughlin thundered . " I send you a call for the mobilization of all Christianity against the God of Gold . " This exhortation was followed by the government 's amazing revelation // that Father Coughlin was the holder , through his secretary , of more silver than any other person in Michigan ? five hundred thousand ounces . It was at this period , too , that he was urging the expulsion of the " moneylenders from the temple " and con-demning Wall Street . It was then revealed that the priest was playing the stock market and his defense ? that he was simply investing money ? was identical with the defense of those he condemned . Father Coughlin 's ambition to be a maker of Presidents was undimmed by his first sad experience , and the next time he tried , it was by climbing on the already ascending band wagon of Huey Long , only to have the wagon shot out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he decided to climb on no more band wagons , but to make his own choice of a man to rule the nation . In 1936 , he chose his own candidate , William Lemke , who was so unmistakably labeled with the Coughlin trade-marls that there could be no renunciation in case of a victory . In the bitter heat of the campaign , Father Coughlin made a promise . " If I can not swing 9,000,000 votes to Mr. Lemke , I 'll stop broad-casting educational talks on economics and politics . " Mr. Lemke polled exactly 891,858 votes and Father Coughlin , cornered for the moment , made his farewell broadcast : " I am withdrawing from all radio activity in the best interests of all the people . I am doing this without offering one word of alibi , thus proving that my word is better than my bond . " Those who had followed Father Coughlin 's broadcasts closely could not fail to discern in them the seeds of a perfect Fascist demagogue , even to the racial intolerance . And when he returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer in the role of a king-maker , but as an advocate of a new era for America . The Father Coughlin who returned to the microphone in 1937 made no bones about his love for Fascism and Nazism , nor did he attempt to conceal his contempt for democracy . On November 6 , 1937 , he contemptuously denounced the " magic of numbers . " Speaking of the French Revolution , he said , " A new king was set upon the throne of Notre Dame in Paris ? the king symboliz-ing the magic of numbers ; the king which said , Mankind is king and the majority shall prevail . ' " This magic of numbers ? we call // it democracy ? he blamed for having kept religion out of government , disdaining to recognize that freedom of worship and the separation of church and state is a cardinal American principle . In the same vein , his Social Justice magazine declaimed , " Democracy ! A mockery that mouths the word and obstructs every effort on the part of an honest people to establish a government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coughlin long leave his listeners in doubt as to what he proposed as an alternative to our present form of government . Flatly he came out with a proposal that we scrap our Congress , abolish our representative form of government and set up in its place a Fascist creation he labeled the " Corporate State . " His talk of March 13 , 1938 , dealt exclusively with this " Corporate State , " expounded fourteen points as its essentials . The fourteen points were but condensations of the twenty-five point Nazi program outlined by Dr. Frederic I. Schuman in " The Nazi Dictatorship . " Following his solemn promise to forsake broadcasting , the priest 's militant return to the air marked more than an attack upon the American Government ; it marked the employment by the priest of every Nazi technique in effecting his purposes . At his enemies , he shouted " Jew " and " Communist ! " He revived the long-discredited " Protocols of Zion , " papers purporting to show a Jewish conspiracy for world domination which , time after time , have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the papers might not be authentic , but they were factual . In the face of all this , Father Coughlin 's paper , Social justice , carried this amazing statement : " The only source of truth is Father Coughlin ! " That is a position even the Pope does n't take in the Roman Catholic Church . If the rise to powerful and influential stature of men like Long and Coughlin is an argument against free broadcasting , then the reaction of the American public to the Royal Oak priest ? now entirely stripped of pretense and baring his true colors for all to see ? is an argument on behalf of free broadcasting . Where once Father Coughlin had boasted sixteen million followers , his listening audience had dwindled to less than two million . Other events now moved with a tragic swiftness for the Richelieu of 1932 . Seventeen Christian Fronters , arrested in New York City on conSEEDS // spiracy charges , were linked to the priest . Coughlin at first denied any connection with them , later recanted and espoused their cause . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he left ? intentionally ? the impression that he was being censored ; that sinister forces were putting the muzzle on his talks . Why ? The one conclusion which is logical and inevitable is that the mystery and melodrama which shrouded the Coughlin broadcast of that day was the pitiful , planned and deliberate attempt on the part of a frustrated and ambitious man to regain by trickery the audience he had lost by his lust for power , an audience which is as essential to the egocentric appetite of the man as the bread he eats . If there is any other reason , only God and Father Coughlin know it . And Father Coughlin is n't talking . Chapter Six THERE WERE GIANTS N THE FORTRESS OF THE LORD WHICH IS ZION ( AND WHICH lies in northern Illinois , halfway between the Sodom of Chicago and the Gomorrah of Milwaukee ) there is revolt . You can read it in the eyes of old-timers as they walk dazedly along the streets , eying youths with cigarettes between their lips or the new drugstore where love-story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displayed . But mostly you can see it in the laughing eyes of the younger generation ? girls with bobbed hair and silk-stockinged legs showing brazenly beneath short skirts ; boys who openly sip Coca-Colas at public fountains . There is no longer a fear of damnation and sudden death . And no longer do signs on the streets of the Lord 's stronghold warn : " Traitors , Buttinskies , Unbelievers : The fires of hell burn everlastingly ! " Something has happened in Zion . I sensed it as I walked down its sleepy little streets ? Bethlehem and Bethesda and Lebanon . Revolt had come from the air into which Zionists raised their imploring hands ; revolt was borne on the ether waves by radio , an instrument which Zion 's founder probably would have banished along with the theater and the drugstore and the physician , if such banishment were possible . Revolution is born of knowledge , and to Zion the radio had brought knowledge . It is a fascinating story . It is , too , the story of an early broadcasting giant who built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to preach that the world was flat ! In igoo , John Alexander Dowie , sainted founder of the Church of Zion , officially the Christian Catholic Church , led his faithful followers to a 6,5oo acre tract fifty miles north of Chicago . A stranger band of pioneers I defy you to find anywhere . They were 96 // cripples and invalids of every description who , under the prayers of Dowie , had thrown away their crutches and laughed at the medical men . These were the builders of Zion , men and women grateful to the Lord for the cures He had effected ; and they reared a great tabernacle which they called Shiloh , in His name . Dowie had dreamed of " one city , one faith , one people , one industry . " Zion was the city , faith healing was the faith , cured cripples were the people . There was not one industry , but many which the Church sponsored and nurtured and controlled ? a bakery , a candy factory , a printing plant , a lace factory , a department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And because faith in Him was the greatest healer , no doctors or druggists were allowed to practice in the city limits . As General Overseer of the Lord 's work in Zion , Dowie 's powers were complete and dictatorial . But he kept his iron fist well concealed beneath a glove of geniality and warmth that held his followers . His successor , and current General Overseer , Wilbur Glenn Voliva , is less fortunate in his personality . To those who disagreed with him , lie thundered the threat of a burning hell-fire from the pulpit , not hesitating to use names in his denunciations . The verbal strong arm was all right . But when dissenters insisted upon dissenting despite anything Voliva said , . he resorted to the physical strong arm . His police force administered ? by night , mostly , and sometimes by the light of day when there was a legal leg to stand upon ? brutal beatings to those who dared to disagree . There is probably no more eloquent statement of city policy anywhere than is contained on a signboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zion is under the control of " Wilbur Glenn Voliva . Outside factories not allowed here and no other families wanted . " It was in 1923 that the General Overseer , finding seditious ideas being circulated about Zion and suspecting the radio inasmuch as outside newspapers were not allowed , decided to fight fire with fire . By 1924 , WBCD ? erected at a cost of $140,000 and one of the most widely heard stations in the country ? was completed by the Church of Zion . Programs were strictly of a re98 SOUND AND FURY ligious nature : sermons , Bible studies , sacred music and the wizard 's persistent predictions that the world would come to an end on such and such a date , as well as his persistent maintenance that the earth was flat . Once he took a trip around the world to prove his theory ; never once saw evidence of curvature . The Overseer warned parents against the devastating effect of listening to programs other than those of WBCD : warned them to keep a close watch upon the type of program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comedy were taboo on Zion loudspeakers . " Do n't listen to the devil , " Voliva warned . The first physical sign of a widespread revolt in Zion was a direct result of radio broadcasting of Sunday baseball games . It came in the fight of the youth of Zion , backed by an adult sympathy also evoked by radio , for the privilege of playing baseball , and a test case , carried to the state Supreme Court , resulted in a declaration that the city ordinance banning baseball was unconstitutional . Early on the morning of April 2 , 1937 , Zion was awakened by the shrill screeching of the fire siren . Shiloh Tabernacle , where the radio station was housed , was ablaze . Three hours later , the building was razed . Later a young man confessed to the crime of sprinkling kerosene and starting the fire . His was a grievance , he said , against Voliva for mistreatment of his family . Later still , the youth recanted , was tried and acquitted . Now , the Zion station was no longer on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They call Chicago and Milwaukee " outside . " Events followed rapidly , one upon the heels of the other . Voliva 's policemen arrested a youth for smoking , and the state Supreme Court set him free . Ladies bobbed hair , donned silk stockings . Ball games were played openly as Voliva sulked in his twenty-three room apartment in the Zion home and watched his flock slip away from him by hundred lots . Three physicians ventured to move into the faith-healing stronghold without suffering physical violence ; a drugstore followed . Then , as a climactic finale to the whole amazing revolt , three boys who had once been condemned from the pulpit by Voliva as shining examples of scarlet sin gained control of the city government in the 1939 election . Mayor Richard Hire had sinned // only in withdrawing from the Church of Zion . But Chief of Police Alvin Ruesch and his brother , Martin , now supervisor of police , had both been badly beaten and tossed in jail for . . . smoking . The revolt has touched in strange places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Today , the only place in Zion where you can see popular motion pictures is in the Church of Zion . And in Shiloh Park , church teams play a regular schedule of softball , . and you may witness the strange spectacle of girl players wearing abbreviated shorts manufactured in the lace factory the sainted Dowie built at Zion . Voliva was not a peculiar figure in broadcasting 's early days . Noncommercial broadcasting appealed almost solely to men with a hobby , a hate or a personal viewpoint to foist down the ears of listeners who felt that the very miracle of words , transmitted through the air , was sufficient reason for staying up all hours of the night to listen . Who does n't remember the " Listen , World , " with which Colonel Henderson , from Shreveport , egotistically ushered in his profane attacks upon the chain stores ? Dr. Brinkley 's Medical Question Box was always a good , spicy half hour 's listening . In fact , some vivid personality invariably identified almost every pioneer station for the growing army of listeners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Judge , was the reason folk tuned in WSM , in Nashville . Out in Chicago , an announcer , Jerry Sullivan , was slaying listeners with his peculiar pronunciation of " Chicago , " which was something between a sneer and a sneeze . Lincoln , Nebraska , had " Gloomy Gus " ; " The Little Colonel " was carrying on from Atlanta . The early days also boasted a ghost that talked . This was out in Los Angeles where a crank station operator played records over the air until they grew monotonous . Then he would imitate Garbo and John Gilbert . Sometimes , he would broadcast his phone number , invite calls ; when people would comply he 'd insult them over the phone . A favorite Hollywood party sport was calling the number and parrying answers with the quick wit of the chap . People knew where his studio was located but he always kept the doors locked . No law ? except that of economics ? barred him from broadcasting . But that law finally got him down and deI00 SOUND AND FURY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite . One of the startling ? in his literal rise and fall ? radio per-formers to hold a mike was The Great DeWese , hired by a Chicago station to leap from a soaring plane with a portable trans-mitter and , descending to earth via parachute , describe his sensa-tions for the listening audience , DeWese was a barnstorming stunt man with little knowledge of broadcasting , but he faithfully promised to talk into the mike on his way down . With this sacred promise , the broadcasters felt free to publicize the stunt ? and hardly a prospective listener in the great Midwest failed to tune in for the sensational broadcast . Because DeWese was using a portable transmitter ? really a miniature broadcasting station ? a license to operate it had been obtained , and the broadcaster had impressed upon the stunt man the necessity for beginning his broadcast with a station identifi-cation , which happened to be some complicated experimental combination of letters and figures , like W2XF . To be even more certain that DeWese did n't forget the identification , he called the stunt man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure . As the plane took off and soared high in the heavens , an an-nouncer described each move to an interested audience , subtly built suspense . Then , DeWese ? a tiny speck against the deep blue of the heavens ? was hurtling downward . Like a puff of dust , the ' chute opened , checked the swift descent into a lazy white bubble floating against the blue . The announcer said , " He 's corn-ing . Now we 'll hear from the Great DeWese ? first man ever to broadcast from a parachute ! " But there was no word from DeWese , no slightest sound . Slowly the parachute drifted down , settling at last to earth . The announcer apologized to the audience , explained that technical difficulties had interfered . Then , fit to be tied , he rushed over to where the barnstormer was untangling himself from the mesh of ropes . " What happened ? " DeWese calmly extricated himself and stood up . " I forgot them letters you told me to say , " answered the Great THERE WERE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to do no jail stretch for a lousy fifty bucks . " DeWese for all his sad record as a broadcaster , inaugurated the stunt broadcasting that was to become such a fad in the twenties , a fad from which grew the man-on-the-street broadcasts , the stra- tosphere balloon programs , eventually the world news roundups . It is not odd , however , that the giants who really dominated the early world of broadcasting should be , largely , the announcers . In the first place , the announcers were the only performers about the studios who were paid for their services and made a full-time job of broadcasting . In the second place , the early announcers of radio were a versatile lot , hired not only to announce but to entertain audibly in some other fashion ? as singers , pianists , patter artists . Dean of American announcers is Milton Cross , perhaps the best announcer radio has yet developed . Today , Cross handles some of the biggest NBC shows , and his name on a new program is the hallmark of that program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stump the experts . ... You 've heard him say that week after week . You 've also heard him say , " This is Milton Cross speaking to you from Box 44 at the Metro politan Opera House . " It is on musical broadcasts that Cross is really at his best . His voice takes on a tinge of reverence , almost of awe , as he solemnly introduces the Saturday opera broadcasts . One feels that each moment he spends in Box 44 on the rim of the Golden Horseshoe is one of complete satisfaction ; his pride in the opera and the artists is almost paternal . Cross has a right to feel paternal . He 's the second oldest broad- caster in the business . A native New Yorker , he was studying at the Institute of Musical Art to become a school music super- visor at the same time he developed a fine tenor voice when a friend persuaded him to try out for a singing job with WJZ  --  then a cubby-hole in the Westinghouse plant near Newark . Radio was a self-deprecatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so delighted to have a real musician show an interest in broadcasting that he hired Cross on the spot . He did song recitals for several months and when the station felt IO2 SOUND AND FURY that it had grown sufficiently to support two announcers , he became the second one . Announcing was soon his paramount work , and he was one of the first to recognize what a fine career could be made of it . By 1929 , his smooth diction and the vast background of technical knowledge which entered into each minute introduction or announcement he made caused the American Academy of Arts and Letters to award him its gold medal as radio 's finest announcer . Big ? he is over six feet tall ? and husky , his gold-rimmed glasses encircle a pair of kindly , laughing eyes . He conducts one of the best children 's programs on the air ? " Cross Country on a Bus " ? but talking about music over the microphone is his greatest pleasure . He still sings for his own enjoyment , accompanied by his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York church . Unlike most present-day announcers , he prepares his own musical scripts through long hours of research in the library and through close acquaintanceship with many of the greatest names in music . Among those announcers he " broke in " to the business ? and they are almost endless , for NBC always points the finger at Cross in explaining what it seeks from newly hired announcers ? was Ted Husing , another giant of radio 's antediluvian age . Ted ? his real name is Edward B. ? Husing is also a native New Yorker , born over a saloon in the Bronx . The son of a migratory club steward who traveled about New York State , Ted 's earlier years may largely account for his wanderlust . Later , Husing , Mere , settled down in New York City long enough for his son to get kicked out of both Stuyvesant and Commerce high schools , then to go on a freight-train barnstorming trip that took him into the wheat-harvesting circles of Kansas , Nebraska and Illinois and , when the United States declared war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was assigned to intelligence work . After the war , the youth ? he had gotten into the army with a phony name , Hastings , and a phony birth certificate which upped his age two years ? tried his hand at real estate , eventually answered an advertisement for a radio announcer in the New York Times , again using a phony college degree to qualify , a degree then being one of the essentials of such a task . The blind ad led to WJZ // and a job . Incidentally , Husing was probably one of the first announcers hired to just announce . He could n't sing , and he boasted no other entertaining dualities than the gift of talk . At WJZ , he joined an announcing staff which included Milton Cross , Norman Brokenshire and John B. Daniel . Brokenshire was a great favorite on commercial programs . From the stiff introductions which marked announcers ' work in those days , he had evolved something new ? the intimate conversational type of introduction and sales talk , and listeners loved it . John B. Daniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polished , with a wide range of ready knowledge . He drew the most difficult assignments at WJZ , handled them all , excepting sports , in his stride . A career which might have been comparable to that of Cross came to a tragic conclusion in 1927 when Daniel died of appendicitis . But the biggest thing in early broadcasting happened to be sports . Major Andrew White , giving listeners a blow-by-blow description of the Dempsey-Carpentier brawl from Boyle 's Thirty Acres differs but little from a modern Clem McCarthy describing the Louis-Nova battle . Sports-casting had no crawling or creeping stages . It jumped down from the obstetrical table , kicked its heels in the air and started out to do a job . Sports broadcasting was a chore to which broadcasting was ideally adapted . It is not strange , then , that the early announcers who won the widest popularity were those who specialized in sports . Sports gave the young Husing his big break . On Thanksgiving Day , 1924 , Husing attended a game , as Major White 's assistant , which meant telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Major missed . The experience made up Husing 's mind . And although it took him five years to make the grade ? until he joined the newly organized Columbia Broadcasting System in 2929 ? it is largely as a sports announcer that Ted Husing is known by the public . Meanwhile , at WJZ he handled some of NBC 's biggest broadcasts , the President 's speeches , the World Court debate , in addition to commercial assignments . During the interval when Husing was getting his broadcasting feet , another announcer , with sports-casting as his springboard , had leaped from the obscurity of an unknown concert singer to // national fame . Graham MacNamee is still a favorite with listeners and with the newsreel for which he does commentaries . MacNamee 's story is typical of broadcasting 's early days . He was hired as a singer when he strolled into WEAF early in 1922 to see for himself what broadcasting was all about . He was doing jury duty in the old Post Office Building and during a recess happened to pass the A. T. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the elevator , he got into conversation with a man who turned out to be assistant manager of the station and , before MacNamee left , he had been hired to sing . Like Milton Cross , he was soon impressed into announcing as a side line , and soon the side line was the main line . The World Series of 1925 , between the New York Giants and the Washington Senators , skyrocketed the St. Paul youth to a renown of which he had never dared dream . An exciting series ? in which Washington was participating in a World Series for the first time and Walter Johnson , idol of every baseball lover , got his long-sought chance at baseball immortality ? was coupled with MacNamee 's enthusiastic word pictures . His descriptions , as some critics remark , may not have been too accurate in the heat of the moment , but they did convey excitement . In fact , excitement was his stock in trade . He never went before the microphone cold , but did anything ? from physical exercise to arguing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air . No matter how dull an event , listeners knew that , if they tuned in an NBC station , they would have color and warmth from MacNamee . Today , listeners are more exacting . They got that way after several heavyweight battles in which , according to the announcers , the loser had won . The jolt of learning that the judges had given the decision to the winner was too much for tense nerves and heavy bettors ; the broadcasters and fight promoters got together and insisted that sports-casters stick closer to the truth . One day early in the twenties , WEAF decided to take its microphones into Carnegie Hall and air the concerts of the Philharmonic Orchestra . The Philharmonic Society welcomed the idea ; so did the Philharmonic 's director , Breslau-born , gentle , // missionary-minded Walter Damrosch . But Dr. Damrosch felt that just the broadcast of a symphonic concert to the masses , untrained to hearing such music , was not taking full advantage of an op portunity . He 'd like to explain the meaning of the different movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why certain selections were considered great music . " Suppose , " Dr. Damrosch suggested ? he was deeply interested in this new medium for bringing his beloved music to the masses and anxious that no little note of it be lost ? " that I run over the score first on the piano , explaining as I play the significance of it ? " That seemed an excellent idea to WEAF officials who saw that such talks would not only add to , but would lengthen the broad-cast . In those days , filling even the few hours that radio stations were on the air was a major matter . Dr. Damrosch , seated at the piano , ran over the score , all the while chatting informally about the composer , his life , his works and the particular work he was playing . WEAF officials were pleasantly surprised at the mail that poured in next morning from gratified listeners . Out of this simple broadcast grew NBC 's Music Appreciation Hour , one of the oldest NBC programs and one of its best-known sustaining and educational shows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely the same as it was back in those early days except that , today , it is required listening for eight million children in public schools equipped for the reception of such programs and supplied with manuals by NBC . By the end of the twenties , listeners were beginning to tune for programs , rather than distance , and among the favorites of those early days ? 1928 is an early date in broadcasting ? were the Smith Brothers , a vocal duo advertising cough drops ; the Silver-masked Tenor , who sang for a tire company ; Roxy , the im presario who produced such sparkling radio broadcasts that he was able to build his own theater by selling shares in it to his radio listeners and his gang ; the Gold Dust Twins ; Harry Reser and his Cliquot Club Eskimos . The Eskimos were one of radio 's big ? and early ? commercial broadcasts , and the man who originated , wrote and produced it , Io6 SOUND AND FURY Raymond Knight , was one of the most brilliant figures in early broadcasting . Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its puns ? and there are few puns hitting the airways today which can top them ? directed its actors and even acted himself . One of the difficulties NBC had with Knight arose from his versatility . He was hired as a continuity writer , but an inviolable NBC ruling barred script writers from doing their own production . Everyone knew that Ray could do a better job on his own scripts than anyone else , but a ruling was a ruling . Suddenly some bright boy at the studio had an idea . Rather than employ Knight to write script , which would bar him from producing , they would hire him as a producer because the ruling said nothing about producers writing script . That 's how broadcasting was born ; it 's where it is today because someone in the industry always can find some way to get around bans , rulings and the FCC . Broadcasters , on the whole , are a resourceful lot . Jack Pearl , better known to early day listeners as Baron Munchausen , was another prime favorite with the fun-loving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was among the first of the comedians to gain commercial sponsorship . Pearl set a precedent for other stage stars : Ed Wynn , who in 1932 headed up radio 's first really big-time show , Texaco 's Fire Chief broadcast , Eddie Cantor , George Jessel , the Duncan Sisters . The Maxwell House Showboat , coming late in the twenties and modeled after the Kern-Ferber stage hit , was a pioneer of the big-time variety show . Set on a showboat in the Mississippi , it starred Charles Winninger , grand old character man of the screen and stage , as Captain Henry , and Lanny Ross , a youth with a rich , romantic tenor voice . Showboat was a grand setting for Ross ' voice and after his first few broadcasts , his fan mail was as heavy as any in the business . On his own song program today , his fan following is terrific , his appeal to women ranks second to none . Once , the coffee people got tired of the showboat idea and ordered the agency to alter the program . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the question . To bring about a logical transition , the agency decided to stage a fire , have // the showboat burned and then take the troupe into the tent-show business . Unfortunately , one of the soap manufacturers , presenting the Gibson Family , also decided to pep up its dramatic program by adding music and variety . They planned to do this by having the stage-struck Gibson youngsters go into the ? you guessed it ? tent show business . The two decisions were reached simultaneously in the rival agencies . When the agencies learned of each other 's plans , a race to see who would get into the tent-show business first was on with the Gibsons winning . There was nothing for Maxwell to do but cancel its arson and let the showboat , like the river it traveled , go rolling along . A few years back , the showboat idea was dropped for the Hollywood Good News idea , worked out in conjunction with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios . Not a giant in his own right , but the great-granddaddy of several current broadcasting giants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a whole raft of other quiz programs , is W. M. Hickey , president of a tire company in Hartford , Conn . Back in 1928 , Mr. Hickey got the idea of adapting a currently popular parlor game to radio and started his " Ask Me Another " series on Hartford 's WTIC . Different from anything then on the air , this prehistoric quiz show featured Jack , the Tire Expert , who asked a question and waited seven seconds for the listeners to figure out an answer before giving the answer . Ask Me Another is still on the air from WTIC ; it sometimes draws as many as a thousand letters a day in response to special offers . Ask Me Another not only has the distinction of being the oldest quiz program on the air , but is one of the oldest radio programs on the air . Perhaps no early broadcaster achieved the following that bristling , red-mustached , ex-Briton Boake Carter boasted at the height of his career . Carter was one of the first commentators to achieve national radio renown ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his shoulder . In a way , Carter belongs to the personal journalism age of Greeley , Dana and Pulitzer . In a strictly broadcasting sense , he belongs to the era of Brinkley , io8 SOUND AND FURY Henderson , Baker and other strongly opinionated ? to be charitable ? broadcasters . Carter first stuck his head up above the surface of broadcasting levels during the Lindbergh kidnaping case , when his criticism of the handling of the case caused listeners to begin to wonder if , perhaps , his criticisms were n't just in view of the failure of officials to break the case and the gaudy spectacle New Jersey officials were making of it . Alert to an opportunity when it knocked the first time , Carter found other things to criticize . Neither the Army nor the Navy was being run properly and , besides , there was obviously a crying need for a separate air force . Soon Carter had managed to penetrate the usually thick skins of Washington politicians who , it was reported , were considering a move to deport him on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only had naturalization papers , he waved them under official noses and asserted his naturalized right to speak as he pleased . Carter was broadcasting under the sponsorship of Philco at the time of the Army-Navy run-in , but Carter 's constant antilabor stands in his broadcasts soon brought the picket line to stations airing his talks , the boycott to Philco products . Philco decided to discontinue its association with the fire-eating commentator , and General Foods picked him up . The labor trouble happened again . But this time , Carter went into a huddle with his sponsors and worked out an armed truce . Carter announced that he would suspend all comment on labor ? adding significantly that he would thus let the labor group flounder in ob-scurity ! His troubles with the Roosevelt Administration were not so easily ironed out . Strongly anti-New Deal , his blasts succeeded in irking the brain trusters , inspiring countless protests to General Foods against his talks , and , finally , the dropping of Mr. Carter by General Foods . Other sponsors seemed as little anxious to be associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foods or Philco . So Mr. Carter began a syndicated newspaper column which many Hearst papers use and finally , after several years away from the microphone , reTHERE // turned last year to level his chief attacks against his native England . Carter can air his bitterness ; the sweetness and light boys try to keep theirs off the air . Back in 1925 , for example , there was the case of Uncle Wip , whose chore on a pioneer Philadelphia station was to tuck the kiddies into their unseen trundle beds with a cheery tale designed to induce pleasant dreams and improve the behavior of the youngsters . The broadcast came under the head of good will , but one night Uncle Wip , an embittered man to start with , reached the breaking point . He did manage , however , to keep the sugar-coating on his words till signing-off time . Then , with a vicious flip , he closed the switch ? so viciously that it bounced back open again . " I 'm a son of a b . . . , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of unbelieving youngsters , " if this is n't a hell of a job for a he-man ! " Another classic tale of the early days is supposed to have occurred during an early prize-fight broadcast over KDKA . A local sports writer had been hired to broadcast the match . Unfortunately , the scribe had a financial interest in one of the preliminary fighters who was n't doing so well . Loyally the scribe predicted that the youngster was a slow starter , would soon get out from under his wraps . In the middle of just such a prediction , the kid ran into a haymaker and went down cold . " Jumping Jesus ! " the scribe yelled into the mike , " that dirty b . . . knocked him out ! " Then , suddenly , the writer realized that he was talking to hundreds of unseen listeners , whose protests would mean the loss of his job . Turning his head away from the mike , he cried , " Gentlemen , gentlemen ! Please restrain yourselves . This broadcast is going to thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he explained , " Sorry , ladies and gentlemen , but a fan got a little excited and yelled over my shoulder . It wo n't happen again . " As long as she lived , Madam Schumann-Heinle was a favorite IIO SOUND AND FURY performer on Christmas broadcasts . Something about this kindly , motherly woman who for fifty years had held the esteem and love of great audiences not alone by her magnificent voice , but by the wholesome and inspiring manner in which she lived , tied her intimately in with the spirit of the season which is particularly that of mothers everywhere . She became a Christmas legend in the broadcasting world . Once , while making some records under the direction of Josef Pasternack ? then music director for the Victor Recording Company and later music director of the " Carnation Contented Hour , " and , himself , a pioneer in bringing good music to the airways ? she turned to him and told him she had a last request to make . Madam Schumann-Heink was in excellent health , but Pasternack , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time came , she told him , she wanted him to conduct the Siegfried funeral music over her bier . Pasternack pointed out that she lived on a ranch in California and that it might not be easy to assemble an orchestra capable of playing such music on so short a notice . " Nell , my poy , play it on a piano then , " she laughed . " And suppose , " Pasternack said , " there is no piano at hand . " " Den , my poy , fistle it ! " It was many years afterward that they met again . The singer was about to embark on a screen career . . . and with the same enthusiasm and courage she always brought to new and difficult undertakings . She seemed very happy , and Pasternack was shocked to learn , a few days later , that death had taken her . " Perhaps , " the maestro said to Nelson Eddy , a mutual friend , " God wanted the immortals to enjoy her art . " And he set about the task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Legion planned a great memorial service . Pasternack had no way of convincing them of his obligation to the immortal soul of Schumann-Heink . Other arrangements had been made . But there was his promise ? a solemn thing , given in good faith by one artist to another . He went to the Nelson Eddy home where he was a house guest . There he waited by the piano until the hour set for the last THERE WERE GIANTS rites . Then , with only the mother of Nelson Eddy present , he played the funeral music from " Siegfried , " just as he had promised . Many of the early giants of broadcasting no longer walk the earth . Will Rogers , Joe Penner , Floyd Gibbons , Chic Sale . . . . And in the summer of 1940 , Josef Pasternack dropped dead in a Chicago studio during the rehearsal of a Carnation Contented Hour program , perhaps ? as the Eddys suggested ? because God wanted a great conductor to accompany Schumann-Heink when she sang for the immortals . Chapter Seven FORUM FOR THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF THIS richest nation on earth , unable to withdraw a penny of their savings , asked each other , " What will the government do ? " Newspapers did n't know ; the man on the street , with cash rapidly dwindling , knew that the passage of hours might find him hungry . The unemployed planned desperate measures . There was much loose talk of revolution , and in the large cities , police leaves were canceled . Then , word came from Washington . On Sunday , March 12 , 1933 ? eight days after his inauguration ? the President would speak . Reassuringly , he called it a " fireside chat . " America remembered the man 's great warmth , revived its hopes that he would lead them out of depression . They turned on their radios and listened ? sixty million hopeful , anxious Americans sat by their loud-speakers and listened . The White House announcer said , " Now , the President of the United States . . . . " I want to talk for a few minutes with the people of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many ways , that first fireside chat of the President was a remarkable document . In simple language , the President explained the practices of banking , scored those few unscrupulous bankers who had gambled away other people 's money , and explained his purposes in calling the national bank holiday . He ended with a plea for the confidence of the people . After all , there is an element in the readjustment of our financial system more important than currency , more important than gold , and that is the confidence of the people . II2 // Confidence and courage are the essentials of success in carrying out our plan . You people must have faith ; you must not be stampeded by rumors or guesses . Let us unite in banishing fear . We have provided the machinery for restoring our financial system ; it is up to you to support and make it work . It is your problem no less than it is mine . Together we can not fail ! For all practical purposes , that was the first broadcast from the White House . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coolidge had stood before the microphone and spoken to the people . But the people had n't listened . The combination of a drab speaker and dull issues drove listeners to the livelier competition provided by " Amos ' n ' Andy . " Hoover did n't lack issues but his total disregard of the human equation in talking before the microphone , the almost slide-rule precision and monotony of his talks , proved no listener magnet . In fact , during the period between 1929 and 1932 , Hoover made ninetyfive radio appearances ? only nine less than Roosevelt made from 1932 to 1936 . Hardly a listener now will recall the subject of one such talk . The warm , inspiring phrases of Roosevelt ? " The Forgotten Man , " " All that we have to fear is fear , " " Together we shall not fail " ? will long be remembered . More than any other individual , Mr. Roosevelt has a feel for audiences , a feel for the microphone which has made the vital core of the nation 's activities not the formal reception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Green and East rooms ? but the Oval Room , which , oddly enough , does n't have a fireside . Radio was first used as a political weapon in 1924 when Coolidge and Davis went before the microphones to reach potentially large audiences . As a political weapon , radio had not yet come of age ? which was n't radio 's fault as much as it was the fault of candidates who came to the microphone bearing no gifts of diction or persuasion , no spark of warmth . By 1928 , however , broadcasting was ready to play a larger part . The " Sidewalks of New York " accent brought to the microphone by Al Smith , was // a first touch of color or glamour for political broadcasters . And radio played a large part in that campaign . That campaign , utilizing radio on a widespread basis for the first time , brought one important fact to light . No longer could a candidate , speaking to the wheatgrowers of the Midwest , promise a high tariff and , later , reverse himself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South . Words that a candidate spoke in Chicago were heard simultaneously in Memphis . Radio , eliminating distance , was serving to eliminate political false promises and ambiguity and to force upon candidates , if not truth , then at least partial consistency . But it was the Groton English , the excellent diction , the confidence-inspiring campaign speeches of Roosevelt during the desperate summer and fall of 1932 that made radio really effective in political debate . For the first time , a man who understood the might of the microphone was using that instrument to speak intimately to the people . And the people listened . In the far , left-hand corner of the egg-shaped basement room of the White House ( which , in formal moments , is termed the Diplomatic Reception Room , in informal moments the Oval Room ) is the curio-cluttered Presidential desk from which the fireside chats are broadcast . In the recessed doorways of the room stand the improvised announcers ' booths ? there were only two for that first chat , Mutual being formed a year later ? which network technicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room is decorated in cream with a maroon carpet , gold chairs , the portraits of other Presidents and their ladies on the walls . In the front of the room , when such a broadcast is to be made , is a battery of newsreel cameramen which will not go into action until after the broadcast when the President reenacts those important excerpts you see upon screens throughout the world . On the occasion of that first fireside chat , most of the original brain trusters were present ? Ray Moley , Warburg , I-Iugh Johnson , names almost forgotten in their White House connections . Today , the Oval Room is apt to be filled with Hollywood stars , rural schoolteachers , biggies and nobodies. // Network technicians and announcers work smoothly to iron out details before the President 's arrival . Carleton Smith ( NBC ) , Bob Trout or John Charles Daly ( CBS ) , and Walter Compton ( MBS ) , the Presidential announcers , agree on the number of seconds for their simultaneous introductions . They already have a confidential copy of the speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from script on momentary inspiration is a catchas-catch-can business . In earlier broadcasts , the President was always accompanied by Jimmy Roosevelt , a member of his secretariat . Jimmy used to prop a foot up on an empty chair and listen to his dad . One night he propped his foot on the lid of a box in which broadcasting equipment had been carried . In the middle of the speech , the lid came down with a resounding bang . The audience jumped , secret-service men rushed forward , Jimmy grinned sheepishly ? and President Roosevelt went right on talking . The President gets along fine with the broadcasters . He 's a firstclass performer and audience magnet ; he seldom runs over his allotted time ; and when the choice of time is left up to Mr. Roosevelt , networks know he will pick an hour when most stations are noncommercial so that rebates to the advertisers from the networks are held to a minimum . Despite the President 's gift for making complicated problems of government and economics understandable to the masses of listeners-in ; despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many who neither believed in his policies nor listened to his persuasive chats . The unfortunate thing then was that such opponents of the President 's policies not only refused to listen to the President but they had no way of making their own views and policies known . Of course , they could buy time on the air ; many stations would even give them time . But when the President spoke , millions listened . When Tom Jones , who did n't give a hoot about the New Deal , or Alf Landon ? who was traveling in the same boat with Tom Jones ? said their say , there were few to hear them out . There are few men who can compare with Roosevelt as a radio speaker ? and Landon was n't one of these . // One night in the spring of 1934 , after George V. Denny , Jr. ? then assistant director of the League for Political Education ? and a friend had been listening to a fireside chat , the friend told Denny of a neighbor who refused to listen to anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that neighbor 's attitude , together with the Fascist blasts against democratic processes and the growing belief among many Americans that democracy was a thing of the past , decided to convert this one man 's intolerance into a bright sword unsheathed on behalf of a living democracy ? the Town Meeting of the Air . Denny , who serves as moderator for the Town Meeting , is a thirty-nine-year-old North Carolinian and today , president of New York 's Town Hall , Inc . He is married , has three children , loves music , dancing , seldom loses his temper , even under the heckling anyone on Town Hall 's platform invariably gets at the hands of the New York crowd participating in each broadcast . He wears silver-rimmed glasses over a pair of twinkling , alert eyes ; has a high forehead which has grown even higher with a receding hairline , and is a sucker for all types of hair tonics . Even now , his first love is the stage and he just missed success as an actor , became a drama instructor as the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall , Inc. , incidentally , is the more popular title he bestowed upon the League for Political Education when he took over as president . To Denny , would-be actor , the reasons for democracy 's failure to function ? as expressed in such acts of intolerance as refusal to hear the other side ? stemmed first from a failure on the part of the nation 's leaders , as a group , to dramatize their messages . In the second place , the spirit of fair play inherent in the American make-up was not being appealed to . What a marvelous medium , he thought , was radio for such a purpose . The very basis of the democracy upon which the various states had been originally founded was the town meeting in which each citizen might have his say . By radio , the entire nation might be converted into one gigantic town meeting in which all shades of political and economic thought could be expounded and kicked about . One day , at a luncheon , Denny told of his idea for a town meeting via radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thenFORUM // vice-president of NBC , was present and urged him to take the plan to John Royal , program director at NBC . He did and Royal ; ever alert to a vital radio idea , agreed to try six programs . NBC would furnish the network , the wire charges and pay the speakers ' costs ? they average a hundred dollars per appearance . Town Hall , in co-operation with NBC 's educational department , would plan and supervise the programs . The first program went on the air on May 30 , 1935 . Denny acted as moderator . The first subject was , " Which Way America ? Fascism , Communism , Socialism or Democracy ? " The broadcast originates in the auditorium of New York 's Town Hall , where some fifteen hundred average Americans gather . Before the program goes on the air , the audience is warmed to the discussion by an hour of free-for-all debate on the issue by the audience , led usually by Arthur Bestor or Dr. Harry Overstreet . A neat arrangement of portable microphones permits people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion . The same system permits them to question the speakers during the question period following the debate . That the first broadcast ? which went on the air without publicity ? drew a response of three thousand letters , was due partially to the fact that Denny 's handling of a ticklish chore is so precise and tasteful . " Ask all the questions you want , " he tells the audience at the opening of the question period , " but do n't call names . " The guests ? from all walks and strata of life , of all nationalities and religious sects ? question at will , and it 's a sad day for the speaker who hedges in answering . Mr. Denny has the idea that what happens to democracy in the future depends largely upon the 20 per cent of American voters who are affiliated with neither political party . They decide elections , they make the issues . So , Town Hall is aimed at this 20 per cent . Even more broadly , it is aimed at drawing away from the political parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of nonconformists . It seeks to do this by making people think about public affairs . At the same time , the Town Meeting of the Air is the best answer broadcasters have been able to cook up to the arguments that radio is not free and that its stand on controversial discussion I18 SOUND AND FURY is a milk-and-water half measure . Town Meeting is built solely on controversy . It boasts an audience far in excess of the collective editorial pages of the American press . Ironically , one of the warmest discussions ever to find its way over Town Meeting ? or any other ? microphone was on the subject , " Do We Have a Free Press ? " Frank E. Gannett , publisher of reactionary newspapers , defended the press ; Harold L. Ickes continued his role as a press critic . The American press is as free as it wishes to be Ickes argued . So far as government control is concerned , the American press is free . . . In fact , the American government annually pays an enormous subsidy to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Yet , while the American press is free as far as the government is concerned , it is nevertheless far from free . . . . Mr. Ickes then listed three accusations which , he maintained , the people level against the press : First it ( the press ) has financial affiliations or is subject to financial pressure which limits its freedom . Second , it is subject to the influence of advertisers , causing omission , distortion or improper slanting of news and affecting its editorial opinions . Third , it is unfair to certain groups of citizens , especially workmen , whose interests conflict with those of the newspaper or its financial backers or advertisers . Mr. Ickes then became specific . Town Meeting folk love facts , and Ickes set out to show how Mr. Gannett 's papers , in particular , were under such influence as he listed . He cited the Federal Trade Commission 's investigation showing certain Gannett papers were largely financed by the International Paper and Power Company . He charged that such financing muzzled any free discussion by those papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part Gannett 's papers had played in opposing passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act , in 1933 , when many of the large advertisers were against its enactment . For the third accusation , Mr. Ickes produced an article from a Gannett paper reporting a Town Meeting program a year before in which Gannett had engaged in debate with Edward O'Neill , of Illinois , a farm leader . The newsFORUM // paper had a column and a half of Gannett 's remarks but not a single reference to O'Neill . Mr. Gannett 's replies were largely in generalities , although he did assert that the financial arrangements for his newspapers were made with the International Paper Company , not Interna tional Paper and Power Co. ? a fact which Ickes , in rebuttal , denied . He dwelt upon the services of the press , accused Ickes of denouncing the press because the press had " defeated " the Roosevelt " court-packing " bill . It was an Ickes night . No one ever captivated a Town Meet ing audience with generalities , and the Secretary of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten even his gun . When the question period for the Gannett-Ickes debate opened , a man arose . Why , Mr. Moderator , was your policy changed tonight to permit a personal attack on a speaker ? Mr. Denny : The policy was n't changed . I want to make this per fectly clear : there is a difference between an attack made anonymously from the floor on an individual , and a speaker who is well-known saying his say from the platform . The man attacked is right here on the platform and can answer back . Woman : ( To Mr. Gannett ) Do you think that distortion of the facts is the privilege of a free press , as manifested during the cam paign for the Presidency in 1936 ? Mr. Gannett : I do n't think any real newspaperman distorts the facts deliberately . There may be a misunderstanding of the facts . I do n't know what you refer to by the distortion of the facts in 1936 . Freedom of the press is freedom to print . You can print your paper and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privilege in America . Man : ( To Ickes ) Did you come here tonight to discuss a free press or to reap vengeance on a newspaperman who happens to disagree with you ? Before Ickes could answer , Mr. Denny spoke : " Now you see , that is the difference between an anonymous attack from a man you do n't know and an attack by Mr. Ickes on Mr. Gannett ? who is here to answer whatever Mr. Ickes has to say . That is a personal question .
