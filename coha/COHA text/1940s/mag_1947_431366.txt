HIGH on a rolling Brazilian plateau , on May 20 , 1947 , we kept a date with the vast , black , racing shadow of the moon . On schedule to the split second , the shadow came speeding at 2,000 miles an hour across our camp site in the semi-jungle , and after more than a year of preparation and a flight of 6,500 miles we were there to meet it . From within the shadow 's cold halftwilight we saw Nature 's most dramatic and awe-inspiring spectacle ? a total eclipse of the sun . Our Army Air Forces ? National Geographic Society Expedition did not travel so far merely to see a sublime celestial show . We made the trip to grasp a rare and fleeting opportunity , only 228 seconds long , to learn something more about that great hot star , our sun , around which our earth circles year after year and on which we depend for life itself . That is the real drama of an eclipse ? man , riding through space on his tiny planet , snatching one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him at all other times , secrets not only of the great star to which his fate is forever tied , but of other stars resembling the sun , and secrets as well of the vast universe far beyond his ken . New Life Comes to Bocaiuva Exciting rumors already had begun to spread in the sleepy little Brazilian town of Bocaiuva , nestling in the green hills of Minas Gerais State , 400 miles north of Rio de Janeiro , back in August , 1946 , many months before that great day of May 20 . An advance party of scientists , khakiuniformed officers of the U. S. Army Air Forces , and officials of your Society had appeared suddenly one day in this out-of-the-way corner of the world . Exploring the countryside far out into the tangled bush that covers the region roundabout , their bustling jeeps had startled the oxcarts and pack trains plodding along the rough , dusty roads ( page 287 ) . Mysterious observations had been made by the visitors and there had been talk that the sun was to be blotted out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear a large area on a hilltop at a remote spot out in the scrub forest , and to carve a long new airplane landing strip in the red earth at the edge of Bocaiuva itself , where large airplanes previously had been almost a curiosity ( page 290 ) . And meanwhile , out in the empty depths of space , the barren , lifeless moon was slowly moving toward a point where , many months later , it would come between the earth and the sun and draw the end of its long , trailing , pencillike shadow across South America , the Atlantic Ocean , and part of Africa ( map , page 295 ) . The inevitable coming of that shadow was stirring up preparations all over the world to observe the eclipse in Brazil . In the United States , scientists of six different institutions  | under the auspices of your Society were building complicated instruments , testing cameras , and making precise calculations in their notebooks . From Army headquarters orders were going out to assemble water-purification equipment , medical supplies , electric generators , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , radios , and DDT spray bombs . Officers and sergeants of the Air and Ground Forces who had seen service on the fighting fronts of China , India , North Africa , Europe , and the Pacific islands were getting travel orders again ? this time for Brazil . Thus preparations went forward at increasing tempo to keep our date with that shadow , which astronomers knew for a certainty would one day come racing across that very clearing that was being carved out on the hilltop beyond Bocaiuva . Led by Dr. Lyman J. Briggs , chairman of your Society 's Research Committee , 16 scientists , 55 officers and noncommissioned officers of the Army Air and Ground Forces , and five members of the National Geographic staff took part in our expedition . Thanks to the enthusiastic cooperation of Gen. Carl Spaatz , commanding general of the AAF , it was the first large eclipse expedition ever to be completely airborne . A1 : personnel , and 75 tons of supplies and apparatus , were transported by aircraft of the AAF 's Air Transport Command from the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saving incalculable time and making transportation infinitely easier . General Spaatz further arranged for the AAF to operate our camp , make weather observations , and supply rations and pure water . The AAF also handled numerous details of arrangements in Brazil , through Brig . Gen. Gordon P. Saville , Chief of the Air Section of the Joint Brazil ? United States Military Commission . Keeping a Date with a Shadow Keeping our date with the moon 's shadow , we carried out one of the most complete programs of observations of a total eclipse of the sun ever undertaken . Our scientists , working feverishly through precious minutes , made hundreds of photographs and other observations . From these will come information obtainable in no other way concerning that all-important giver of life , the sun ? how it affects the earth on which we live , how it  | rules some phases of our daily lives , and other knowledge which will reach deep into the heart of the atom and far out into the mysterious distant reaches of the great universe itself . As we strapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge fourengined C-54 of the Air Transport Command , we already were talking about the weather ? not that day 's weather , but the weather to come on May 20 at our destination in Brazil . For every eclipse expedition is a gamble on weather , a gamble in which thousands of dollars , months of preparation , and weeks of travel are staked on the chance that the sky will be clear over the observation point at eclipse time . An Astronomer Needs Luck A total eclipse of the sun occurs somewhere on earth about every year and a half , but much less often does one take place in a location accessible enough and of a duration long enough to make it worth observing . No total eclipse can last much more than seven minutes , and most of them are much shorter . so that even with the best possible luck an astronomer can hardly hope to have as much as an hour of total time for observing eclipses in his entire life . No wonder , then , that the scientists joked a little hollowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we gained a vivid impression of the far-flung , time-telescoping operations of the great Air Transport Command , and realized anew how today 's air age has shrunk the globe . The big C-54s that carried various sections of our party could make the 6,500-mile trip from Washington to Rio de Janeiro in only three days ! Our course south followed the chain of great airbases built during World War II for the planes that flew by the thousands down to the territory of our loyal ally , Brazil , and  | thence across the Atlantic to the African , Indian , and Chinese fronts . While we were gazing down from above scattered clouds at the vast , swampy , jungleclad delta of the mighty muddy Amazon far below , our navigator came aft to remind us that we would cross the Equator in a few minutes . The Polliwogs aboard , who never had crossed the Line before , began to fidget uneasily in their seats , while knowing grins appeared on the faces of the initiated oldtimers . Suddenly the pilot waggled his wings as a signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern . In the excitement nobody happened to see Jupiter Rex come aboard , but there he was , complete with rope-yarn beard , crown , and flying jacket . ( Jupiter initiates those who cross the Equator in the air , just as Neptune handles it on board ship . ) One by one the sheepish Polliwogs were herded back to the rear of the cabin , where they knelt before the Ruler of Winds and Weather to receive initiation into Jupiter 's Empyrean Realm . Rising , they received a smart wallop on an appropriate portion of their anatomy , for flyers do not follow the shipboard ritual of ducking in a tank . Over Rio 's Famed Harbor Late the next day we were circling for a landing over Rio de Janeiro 's incomparably beautiful mountain-rimmed harbor . Brazilian Army bugles from a fort on a near-by point , sounding shrilly through the pounding of the surf on world-renowned Copacabana Beach , woke us in our oceanfront hotel early next morning . Soon we were flying again , this time in an AAF C-47 two-engined plane , over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that lies between Rio and Bocaiuva , 400 miles to the north .  | Less than three hours later we had landed at the airfield specially built for the expedition 's planes and were bouncing in jeeps over the 14 miles of country road out to camp , swallowing generous quantities of red , dryseason dust . This road , originally a rough , narrow track through the bush , was widened and graded , and its primitive wooden bridges strengthened so that it could be negotiated by the Army trucks that transported our scientific instruments , equipment , and food supplies from the landing field to camp ( page 291 ) . Your Society 's Funds Build Base Camp Incidentally , the entire cost of the airfield , improvement of the road , and construction of the camp , as well as the purchase of fresh food used in the mess , expenses of the scientists , and construction of their apparatus , was financed by research funds of your Society . Bocaiuvans wondered why our camp was placed so far from town , out at " Extrema , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be located as near as possible to the center line of the path to be followed by the moon 's shadow . Duration of the eclipse is longest at the center line , and our scientists wanted to make use of every possible second of the alltoo-short period of totality . A Cattle Rancher Aids Science Use of the land was donated by its owner . Senhor Joao Antonio de Sigueira , a cattle rancher whose little adobe house sat beside a stream in a pleasant glade about a mile down the road . A friendly host , he visited us often . and the women of his family were kept busy doing our washing . At the camp site , the advance party of Army personnel and Brazilian workers , starting weeks before in the mud and discomfort of the rainy season , had erected three dozen pyramidal tents in neat rows , and a semipermanent building of adobe brick with a tile roof to serve as our mess hall and kitchen ( Plate IV ) . Under the efficient direction of Col. Paul C. Schauer , project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistant , Maj. Jerome Alexander , and our hard-working camp commander , Capt . John M. Rice , the camp , run in standard Army style , became a little bit of home set down in the midst of this far-off patch of Brazil . Almost everything , even to the heavy portable electric generators and our seven jeeps , had been flown to Bocaiuva by AAF transport planes , most of it all the way from the U. S. A. ( page 287 ) . Only the big six-wheeled truck and three lighter trucks , or weapons carriers , had been driven under their own power from Rio as far as the condition of the roads permitted , then loaded on the narrow-gauge wood-burning railway that runs through Bocaiuva . We had electric refrigerators for the kitchen , lent by the Brazilian Air Force , electric lights in the tents , mess hall , and camp " streets , " and a public-address system that made it possible to page anyone in the broad camp area . Field telephones linked the weather tent , radio tent , scientific laboratory tent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melvin M. Payne , who was busy from dawn to bedtime with never-ending administrative details . The sheets on our Army cots were flown each week to Rio for washing , an 800-mile round trip to the laundry ! Under supervision of our doctor , Lt. R. V. Ramirez , water from a near-by stream was filtered and chlorinated ( Plate XVI ) . Just before sunrise each morning , at 6 a.m. ,  | our leather-lunged veteran Army cook , Sgt. Bill Vaughan , banged on his iron gong and shouted in stentorian tones , " Let 's go ! Let 's go ! A h-a-p-p-y good morning to you all ! C-o-m-e and g-e-t it ! " ( Plate XVI . ) Sleepy , tousled campers emerged protestingly from their warm blankets and lined up Army style in the mess hall for " chow . " A typical breakfast was fresh grapefruit , pancakes and bacon , bread , jam , and coffee . By 7 a.m. everyone was at work . From the scientists ' " workshop " tent came the steady " beep , beep " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which our chronometers were checked daily ( page 406 ) . At the same time could be heard the loud hiss of hydrogen gas being released from a steel cylinder to inflate one of the weather unit 's radiosonde balloons , sent up four times a day around the clock . As the balloon soared off into the blue , soon disappearing from sight , the little radio hanging beneath it sent back a continuous code message telling the temperature , pressure , humidity , and wind conditions far aloft . Constantly in the background , day and night , was the unceasing hum of the electric generators , all-important heartbeat of the camp , supplying power for lights , radio , refrigerators , and scientific instruments . As work went forward , the scene in camp reminded me of the arrival of the circus in town back home . Against the background of colorful flags and dark green tents , trucks chugged across the field , piled high with varicolored boxes and packing cases . Gangs of swarthy Brazilian workers , directed by Army noncoms and scientists , unloaded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hammered , sawed , and mixed concrete . Cumbersome native carts , with huge solid wooden wheels , drawn by six or eight patient , plodding oxen , hauled lumber and sand ( Plates XII and XIII ) . Adding to the circus atmosphere , Brazilian cowboys often rode into camp , sporting leather hats , colorfully dyed sheepskin saddle blankets , and huge spurs sometimes strapped on bare feet . Tame green parakeets squawked in their cages . The final touch was furnished by our Brazilian visitors , who came almost every day to stare curiously at the unfamiliar sights , peer discreetly under tent flaps , and ask questions . As the sun climbed higher , shirts came off and men worked stripped to the waist in the tropic heat . In the cosmic-ray tent the Geiger counters clicked steadily along , recording the passage of the invisible rays raining down constantly from outer space . Every two hours , day and night , an alarm clock rang to remind Harvey Taylor , the observer , to read his meters . Sound of the gong from the mess hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vegetables , bread , coffee or lemonade , and dessert of canned or fresh fruit , pudding , or homemade pie . Snakes and Giant Ants Men off duty played horseshoes and volleyball or explored the woods by way of the innumerable cattle and oxcart tracks that crisscrossed the region , hunting rock crystals or game . Every so often someone killed a snake near the edge of the clearing or stopped to watch the long processions of industrious giant ants excavating underground nests and carrying in bits of leaves for food . By late afternoon a steady parade of towelbearing figures was wending its way toward the outdoor showers . Camp Eclipse had no hot water except in the kitchen , but everyone became hardened ( more or less ! ) to shaving , bathing , and even washing clothes in cold water . Soon after 5 the supper gong sounded and another hot meal of meat , vegetables , fruit , bread , and coffee was dispatched . Card players sat down around a mess table covered with a blanket . As the sun sank behind the western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for tent flaps to be rolled down and sweaters put on . At night the temperature often dropped to the middle 50 's . People congregated in little groups to look at the stars and point out the  | Southern Cross and other constellations of the Southern Hemisphere not visible in the northern skies . " Now hear this , " droned a voice over the public-address system . " The movie tonight will be . . . " That final touch of home was provided through courtesy of the War Department Motion Picture Service . Soon after 9 o'clock most of us were in bed , but for some work went on through the night hours . Out in the darkness of the scientific observation area a tiny electric motor hummed quietly , keeping a telescope pointed at the Milky Way shining brightly in a broad band across the sky overhead . Father Francis J. Heyden , S. J. , of Georgetown College Observatory , stood by patiently , now and then clicking a switch to keep his instrument focused accurately . He was taking advantage of our presence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast aggregations of stars in the Milky Way , at inconceivable distances from the earth . Halfway through the night he awoke his assistant , Father Laurence C. McHugh , S. J. , to relieve him at his lonely task . At an hour past midnight the soldiers on the night shift in the weather tent sent another balloon soaring aloft toward the stars to radio back its message on conditions high in the sky . Over a wood fire , in a big caldron , other weather men were busy boiling their synthetic rubber balloons to restore the " stretch " after long storage . Long before dawn the cooks and their Brazilian helpers were busy in the kitchen mixing pancake batter and making gallons of coffee for another breakfast . Food and Supplies Brought In by Plane Not all of our people shared the comparative comfort of the big main camp . Two of the scientists , James Watts and Franklin Kral of the National Bureau of Standards , and half a dozen officers and soldiers , under command of Lt. Charles Webb , served as a small but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all our food , mail , and supplies were transported by plane from Rio . Their tents and the open shed which served as combination kitchen , mess hall , and repair shop for planes and motor vehicles , were baked by the tropic sun and swept by clouds of dust that blew off the field whenever a plane landed or took off . For a time they  | had to drive two miles by jeep to take chilly shower baths under a small waterfall ! Watts and Kral manned the radio apparatus used for observing behavior of the ionosphere before and during the eclipse . They had to be well removed from the main camp so that their signals would not interfere with the radio we used for communicating with Rio and receiving Naval Observatory time signals ( pages 288 and 310 ) . One never-ending task at the landing strip was fighting the ants which built subterranean nests . These nests , undermining the field , were capable of causing an accident if an airplane wheel should break through . Whenever a new ant nest was discovered , Brazilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milky Way As the weeks passed , some of our scientists carried out projects not connected with the eclipse . One was Father Heyden 's program of photographing the Milky Way , the great wheelshaped galaxy of stars within which our sun and earth are located , about four-fifths of the way out from the center of the " wheel . " Looking up at the Milky Way , we see a dense  | mass of stars because we are looking out through the thickness of the wheel from the inside toward the rim . Years ago Dr. Frank E. Ross , now of Mount Wilson Observatory , made a series of fine photographs of the northern Milky Way which constitute a standard atlas of reference . Father Heyden borrowed his camera and photographed the southern part of the Milky Way , not visible from the Northern Hemisphere , on the same scale . His photographs , added to those taken by Ross , will give a continuous picture of how this great star wheel looks from within , so to speak , looking outward all the way around from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rays , raining down into the earth 's atmosphere from outer space , were measured on the ground , and at altitudes up to 50,000 feet by Geiger counters carried aloft by " trains " of eight balloons launched from camp and on an AAF B-29 and B-17 ( p. 313 ) . The balloon trains , sent up by Martin Pomerantz and Peter Morris , were equipped to radio back to earth the number and intensity of cosmic rays , which increase with altitude . At 50,000 feet the total number of cosmic rays was 50 times that at sea level , and the intensity of the more penetrating rays was 10 times greater than on the ground . All this was part of the great cosmic-ray measuring project being carried out under joint auspices of your Society , the Bartol Research Foundation of the Franklin Institute , and the Army Air Forces . Weather information was collected continuously for more than two months by Maj. William E. Walk and his 18 enlisted specialists of the AAF Air Weather Service . They measured temperature , pressure , humidity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to altitudes as high as 69,000 feet . Their job was not to forecast the weather , but to gather data to be used by some of the expedition 's scientists in calculating results of eclipse observations ( page 311 ) . Their weather facts also will be added to the collection of world-wide weather information which is constantly being gathered by the Army Air Forces and filed for use by commercial air lines and others interested . Measurements of the light from all parts of the sky at various times of day were made by Dr. E. O. Hulburt and Ralph E. Richardson of the Naval Research Laboratory . This information will be utilized in development of an instrument which airplane navigators may use for seeing stars in the daytime at altitudes of 10,000 feet and above as an aid to navigation . Brightness and polarization of the sky 's light determine what stars can be seen in the daytime at various altitudes ( pages 294 and 310 ) . As eclipse day drew nearer , preparations were intensified . One essential task was establishing the exact location of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth , for the observations to time the motion of the moon would be worthless unless the precise point from which they were made was known . This job was done for us by genial Dr. Allyrio Hugueney de Mattos and three of his assistants from the National Council of Geography of Brazil . Bringing with them from Rio a complicated array of precision instruments , they calculated the latitude and longitude of a concrete monument in our camp within less than 20 feet of perfect accuracy , no small accomplishment on a globe nearly 25,000 miles in circumference ! That monument , incidentally , will become a permanent landmark in Brazil 's national survey system ( page 297 ) . Other Brazilian friends , too , came to visit us in increasing numbers ? civil and military officials , newspaper reporters and photographers , groups of scientists , engineering students , even school children with their teachers ? all made the trip out to camp over the miles of rough , dusty road ( Plate XI ) . One Sunday afternoon the Bocaiuva Boy Scout troop arrived in full uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All Brazil displayed a genuine , friendly interest in our expedition . Military and civil officials alike smoothed the way for us , lent us road-building machinery , tents , water pipe , water-tank trailers , and many other things . A Brazilian engineer had charge of building our airport and improving our road . Brazilian Air Force planes helped fly our equipment from Rio to Bocaiuva . Many of us were hospitably entertained by friends both in Bocaiuva and in the progressive city of Montes Claros , near by . Why Observe an Eclipse ? Why is it important , people ask , to travel so far and spend so much time , effort , and money to observe only a few fleeting moments of an eclipse of the sun ? What can you learn , and what good comes of it ? Scientists can do a surprising number of things during the short space of an eclipse of the sun . They can time very accurately the motion of the moon through the sky . They can measure how much a ray of light from a distant star is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way of checking the Einstein theory of relativity . They can get a quick look , indirectly , at the hot gases seething in the outer layers of the sun and make records which will tell something about what those gases are and how they are behaving under conditions of temperature and pressure impossible to duplicate on earth . Such data furnish clues not only to what is happening on the sun itself but help explain the structure and behavior of other more distant stars . The sun is the only star near enough to us to appear as a disk , on which different parts of the surface can be studied . At an eclipse , too , it is possible to gather facts about the huge , nebulous , gaseous corona of the sun , extending far out into space around the sun proper and visible in its entirety only at eclipse time ( Plate I ) . Something also can be learned about how the upper levels of the earth 's own atmosphere are affected by the sun 's rays , by noting what happens in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What good is it all ? In the first place , man is always trying to push the frontiers of his knowledge farther out into the unknown . Moreover , it seems only common sense to try to learn everything possible about the sun , since in the long run it is the most important thing in our lives . Out of its white-hot inferno , very probably , our earth was born . As the sun speeds on through the vast reaches of space , we are inexorably dragged with it on the end of an invisible but unbreakable chain of gravitation . Without its light and heat no life on earth could exist . Ways the Sun Affects the Earth Coming closer to home , the sun 's rays produce effects on the earth every day that are of vital importance in our daily lives . The sun is the motive power of our weather . Its rays , raining down into the upper levels of our atmosphere , create the reflecting layers of the ionosphere , 60 to 250 miles up , which reflect radio waves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winds , little-understood conditions of temperature , and layers of ozone and other gases in the upper atmosphere which we need to know about in this age when stratosphere planes , high-flying rockets , and guided missiles are penetrating into a brand-new world at ever greater altitudes. * This last , incidentally , plus the desire to support the advance of science in general , was one of the important reasons why General Spaatz was interested in having the Army Air Forces take part in our expedition . The Practicality of Relativity Out on the advancing frontiers of modern science , Einstein 's famous theory of relativity plays an important role . It takes a mathematician to understand fully relativity 's strange ideas that space can be curved , that things can have a fourth dimension , which is time . and that energy and mass ( roughly described as weight ) are the same thing . But even relativity has its " practical " side . It has helped explain the structure and behavior of the atom , and thereby is playing an indirect part in the development of atomic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our expedition 's most important projects was to make a check on relativity . You do n't need to understand Einstein to grasp the drama and amazing precision of that experiment . Einstein years ago predicted that one of the tests of his theory of relativity would be that the rays of light from distant stars would be bent slightly as they passed near the sun . He said that this bending would be equivalent to a very small angle , a tiny fraction of one degree of a circle , one and three-quarters seconds of arc . That is the angle made by two straight lines a mile long , touching at one end and only about half an inch apart at the other ! The bending of starlight is caused by the gravitational attraction of the sun , pulling the light rays slightly away from a straight path as they go past , as though they had actual weight . Dr. George Van Biesbroeck of Yerkes Observatory set out to measure that bending . He did it by making two photographs of the same group of stars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheduled to make as this story goes to press , for he returned in August to our camp site where his telescope was left in position . In August that group of stars that surrounded the sun during the eclipse could be seen and photographed in the night sky at the same position in which they were located on eclipse day . On the photograph made during the eclipse . the stars appear around the edge of the sun , but because their light was bent in passing by it on the way to the earth , their images on the photograph are slightly displaced away from where the stars actually are located in the sky . On the second photograph , taken at night when the sun is not there , the light rays from p 300 the stars will not be bent , and the stars will appear in their true positions . Measuring the difference in the stars ' positions on the two photographs , Dr. Van Biesbroeck can determine how much their light was bent in passing the sun and see if it was as much as Einstein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it will be new evidence that the theory of relativity is correct . Dr. Van Biesbroeck had to make his first photograph during the eclipse because only then , when the sun 's light was blotted out , was it possible to catch on his photographic plate the faint images of stars that are drowned out by the sun 's brilliant light at all other times ( Plate VIII ) . Earth 's Atmosphere Bends Starlight , Too Others have measured this bending of starlight at previous eclipses , but their results varied . One difficulty was that the starlight was bent not only in passing the sun but also by refraction as it passed through the earth 's atmosphere . To allow for the bending caused by the atmosphere , you need to know the temperature , pressure , and humidity of the air , since they govern the refraction . During the eclipse the AAF weather men sent up balloon-borne radiosondes that radioed back the temperature , pressure , and humidity of the air up to 50,000 feet , and Dr. Briggs measured temperature near the ground ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biesbroeck to calculate more accurately how much bending of the starlight was caused by the atmosphere and how much by the sun . As a further aid to accuracy , he photographed on his two plates not only the stars he will measure for the bending of their light but also another group of stars off to one side in the sky , reflected into the telescope tube by a mirror . Since the light from these stars did not pass near the sun , it was not bent ; so this " check group " of stars will be in the same position on both pictures , providing an unvarying standard of reference in case temperature or other changes in the telescope cause a slight variation of scale in the two pictures taken three months apart . Results of Dr. Van Biesbroeck 's work will be awaited with the greatest interest by scientists all over the world . More on the practical side were the measurements of the motion of the moon , made by Fathers Heyden and McHugh of Georgetown . They measured precisely the times of the four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times when the edges of the sun and moon appear to touch ? first , just at the moment when the moon begins to move in front of the sun ; second , the instant when it has completely covered the sun ; third , when the sun begins to reappear from behind it ; and fourth , just as the moon and sun part company at the end . Checking Schedule of the Solar System Timing those contacts is a method of checking up on the solar system to see if it is running on schedule . It shows whether the astronomers who forecast the eclipse made a correct calculation of when it would begin and end . It also applies to predictions of future eclipses , and is useful in calculating backward to learn the dates of eclipses in the past , knowledge which sometimes helps in fixing the dates of historical events . It furnishes another check also on the complicated motion of the moon around the earth . This enters into the accurate prediction of the times of high and low tides , information essential to mariners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for it is gradually picking up speed as it moves around the earth . To time the contacts , Heyden and McHugh made a series of photographs which show the moon gradually covering and uncovering the sun . On these pictures , by careful measurements , they can determine the times of contact more accurately than if they had tried to catch the actual moments when the edges of the sun and moon seemed to touch . Looking into the outer layers of the fiery furnace of the sun itself was the job of our spectrograph operators , Dr. C. C. Kiess of the National Bureau of Standards ( Plate VII ) and Dr. Harold F. Weaver of Lick Observatory . For countless millions of years , atoms of hydrogen in the sun have been combining to form atoms of helium . In the process a small amount of matter is left over and is converted into the energy which keeps the sun shining with its terrific heat . Each chemical element in the sun and stars , when excited by heat , sends out light waves vibrating on certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectrograph it is possible to split the sun 's light into a rainbowlike spectrum , an arrangement of lines in which each element can be identified by its own lines which represent its special frequencies . The spectrum lines of each element furnish as characteristic and certain an identification as the fingerprints of a human being . By studying the spectrum it is possible to tell what chemicals are present in the sun 's  | outer layers , and the intensity of the lines indicates the temperature , pressure , and density of these layers . Ordinarily , you can not get a good spectrum of the individual outer layers of the sun because the light from the various layers is mixed together . But at the time of an eclipse , just before the moon covers the edge of the sun , each layer appears by itself for a brief moment along the edge of the moon , and its spectrum can be photographed with no light from the other layers mingled with it . Mysteries of the Corona Out around the sun extends the vast halo of the corona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still is not fully understood ( Plate I ) . One of the mysteries of the corona is that it contains atoms of iron , argon , nickel , and calcium that are highly ionized ? that is , many of their electrons have been stripped off , a process requiring tremendous energy . Some astronomers believe this atom stripping takes place in the corona ; others that the atoms are ionized deep within the interior of the sun by the great heat prevailing there , and then ejected into the corona through openings in the sun 's surface . Study of the spectra of the corona , photographed during the eclipse , would help solve this problem . Unfortunately the spectrographs , which had worked well during rehearsals before eclipse day , failed to function properly at the crucial time , so that the full program of observation could not be carried out . Some answers to the secrets of the sun 's torona were captured , however , by the big cameras of Dr. Irvine C. Gardner , a veteran eclipse observer ( Plate VII ) , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Bureau of Standards . Using special filters and color film , they made photographs of the corona to determine the intensity and color of its light , the extent of its long streamers , and how its light was polarized . ( Light that is polarized vibrates in only one plane . ) The amount of polarization of the corona 's light will help indicate how much of it , if any , is sunlight reflected by solid particles . Pictures of the corona also were taken by Father Heyden . They show streamers extending out to distances equal to two or three diameters of the sun . Other members of the expedition probed into the upper atmosphere many miles above the earth to investigate what happened there when the sun 's light was cut off during the eclipse . They used two kinds of probing tools , sensitive photometers to record intensity of light from the upper atmosphere and highfrequency radio waves . Dr. Hulburt and Ralph Richardson measured the temperature of the air at great altitudes , up to perhaps 40 or 50 miles , beyond where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rockets are perfected . As the moon 's slanting shadow gradually moved over the camp , they could look up through it to the lofty heights above where molecules of the rarefied air were still sunlit . Measuring with great precision the light reflected back to earth from these molecules , it was possible to estimate how many molecules there were in the region beyond the shadow on out to the top of the atmosphere . From this can be calculated the temperature and pressure at these lofty altitudes . Builders of high-flying airplanes , guided missiles , and rockets will use this information in designing their craft to operate efficiently in the cold , rarefied air at great heights . Dr. Hulburt also measured the diminishing brightness of the sun as it was gradually covered by the moon , which will help reveal the amount of light-energy emitted from various layers of the sun 's outer surface ( p. 294 ) . From the ionosphere measuring station . James Watts and Franklin Kral bounced radio waves off the radio-reflecting region in the upper air , seeking to learn what happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this region lie at heights of approximately 60 to 100 , 100 to 150 , and 150 to 250 miles . Long-distance radio signals travel around the earth in great bounces between this region and the earth ( page 288 ) . The ionosphere is created by ultraviolet light from the sun which breaks up molecules of the upper air and makes them electrically conducting . ( Scientists call this process ionization ; hence the word " ionosphere . " ) Effects on Radio Signals The radio signals echoing back from the ionosphere indicated that , as might be expected , when the sun 's light was cut off during the eclipse the layers decreased in ionization somewhat as they do at night , but the effect on the individual layers was different from what it is at night . The echoes were recorded on movie film both before the eclipse , to indicate normal conditions , and during the eclipse itself . When the film is run through a projector it shows images of the layers fluctuating up and down and varying in density . At the time of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thickness , and density . After totality the ionization increased again ,  | but in a different way from that at sunrise . Study of the pictures will help determine whether some of the ultraviolet light that creates the ionosphere layers comes from the sun 's corona rather than from the sun itself . It also will furnish a better idea of processes that take place in the ionosphere region , giving a better understanding of its behavior both at night and in the daytime . All this information eventually will be useful in improving long-distance radio communications . Several Brazilian scientists joined us at camp to make eclipse observations . Dr. Mario de Souza , representing the Brazilian Geographic Society , measured the apparent alti- tude of the sun during the eclipse , which will supply further useful information on the refraction of the atmosphere for Dr. Van Biesbroeck 's measurements of starlight bending .  | Others made observations of the ionosphere , cosmic rays , and the influence of the eclipse on the ion content of the air and its electrostatic condition . On the day before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather would be , began to feel pretty nervous . But Dr. Van Biesbroeck , whose entire success depended upon making one single , crucial photograph , was cool as a cucumber . Just before supper I found him in the washroom , calmly doing some laundry , as if tomorrow were just another day ! " Are you an optimist ? " I asked . " No , " he replied , with a twinkle in his eye . " On eclipses , I 'm a fatalist ! " Eclipse day dawned bright and clear , but soon narrow , thin waves of high cirrus clouds , composed of myriad tiny particles of ice , began to move across the sky from the west , with wide spaces of clear sky between . Would the clouds dissipate before eclipse time ? If not , would the eclipse come in one of those open spaces between the waves of cloud ? That was the question in everyone 's mind as we gulped an early breakfast and hurried to make last-minute preparations . A number of distinguished visitors were in camp to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brazil , Hon. William D. Pawley , Brig . Gen. Gordon P. Saville , Brig . Gen. Francis L. Ankenbrandt , official observer from AAF headquarters , and many high Brazilian military and civil officials ( page 296 ) . Spectators began to drift in . Ben Grauer of NBC and the announcers of four Brazilian radio stations began their preliminary broadcasts . Two airplane loads of Brazilian and American newspapermen arrived from Rio . having left there at 3 a.m. to reach the camp in time . Meanwhile , at 3:30 o'clock that morning .  | the AAF 's photographic crew , in the Heavenly Body , a B-17 equipped with 10 still and movie cameras , took off to photograph the eclipse from high altitudes ( Plate V ) . They flew above 30,000 feet for six hours , breathing oxygen during the entire time as they cruised back and forth within the moon 's shadow , taking eclipse pictures ( Plates II and III ) . First Contact ! Everyone was at his station . It was 8 o'clock now , and first contact , when the moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due in 20 minutes . The loud-speaker system was already broadcasting the amplified ticks of a chronometer , counting off the seconds as a guide to the scientists in their precisely timed operations . Then the timer 's voice broke in ? " Ten minutes to first contact . . . five minutes . . . two minutes . . . one minute . . . first contact ! " Exactly on schedule , as if it had been waiting for the cue , the round edge of the moon began to bite into the upper edge of the sun . A murmur went up from the crowd . At the same instant , Father Heyden 's team sprang into action like a well-drilled gun crew ( Plate X ) . He and Father McHugh , assisted by Lts . Edgar Smith and John Kramer of the AAF , were to photograph the eclipse every 15 seconds from then until the end . Dick Stewart and Roy Phelps started their movie cameras ( Plate IX ) . Stewart was making a documentary film on the entire expedition . Phelps 's movies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing over the NBC television network . The loud-speaker continued to sound its second-ticks , with the timer 's voice calling off five-minute intervals . Through my piece of exposed photographic film I could see the moon moving gradually down over the sun .  | Father Heyden 's crew was working feverishly . Every so often he would dash back with an exposed plate to the darkroom in the tent behind and rush fresh plates out . Darkness and Chill Creep over Earth " Nine twenty-five , " said the voice . " Nine thirty . Five minutes to go . " Now , within a few minutes of totality , it was growing noticeably darker . The sun was almost covered . A perceptible chill crept into the air . Some people pulled on coats ( page 292 ) . Dr. Van Biesbroeck wound up his driving clock . Under his direction , Oliver Westfall adjusted the " Einstein " telescope until the guide star came into view in the small telescope on one side . " One minute to go , " said the loud-speaker . " Ten . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was much darker now . Hardly a sliver of the sun was left along the black advancing edge of the moon . The " Diamond Ring " of Totality " Zero ! " That was the signal for totality . At that instant a ring of bright light burst out all around the edge of the black disk of the moon , and on its lower edge a blindingly brilliant point of light shone forth , a bit of the sun still shining through between two mountains on the edge of the moon . It was the beautiful " diamond ring " effect ( Plate III ) . Alongside the brilliant point of light , others less bright , the Baily 's beads , also shone for an instant between other lunar mountains . Then the sun was completely covered , and around the black moon shone out the great halo of the corona , with faint streamers extending out in all directions ( Plate I ) . Here and there along the moon 's edge could be seen red spots of light , prominences on the sun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the moon 's obscuring rim ( Plate II ) . " Ready , go ! " called Dr. Van Biesbroeck . An assistant lifted the shutter off the end of his telescope tube . " Ten . . . twenty . . . thirty , " said the voice , counting off the precious seconds of totality . Dr. Kiess and Dr. Weaver were bending over , peering through their guiding eyepieces , keeping their spectrographs focused on the sun . One of the weather balloons soared off . Soldiers held another ready to go . Above , as the moon 's shadow passed over , the sky was dark , and below the sun Mercury was shining brightly , with Venus and Mars a little above . A few bright stars could be seen . The darkness was not the darkness of night but more like that of a semi-twilight. and around the horizon there was a ring of light where the sun was shining outside the limits of the moon 's shadow ( page 286 ) . A hush fell over the spectators . We strained our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud was in front of the sun during this crucial period of totality . Some clouds were there , but so thin that they were no hindrance to most of the observations . Inexorably the count of time went on . Already we were in the second of the four short minutes . " Twenty . . . thirty . . . forty . . . middle . " Totality was half over . Eclipse Drama Reported by Radio On a high platform overlooking the scene , Ben Grauer , NBC 's special-events announcer , was describing the spectacle in dramatic and thrilling words for early-morning listeners back home ( page 293 ) . " Ten . . . twenty . . . thirty , " said the voice , counting off the fourth minute . " Ten seconds to go ! End of totality ! " On the instant the beautiful Baily 's beads and diamond ring again flashed out , this time at the upper edge of the sun . Then a crescent of light appeared , gradually widening as the moon moved on downward . In a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the uncovered sun drove off the chill . Newspapermen crowded around with swiftly written news bulletins , and I rushed them to the radio tent . They told the world that our observations had been successful . Then everyone relaxed ? all but Father Heyden and his team . They labored on for 80 minutes more until fourth contact and the end of the eclipse , still timing their actions to the continuing count of the loud-speaker . Between 8:22 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. they took 600 pictures , one every 15 seconds for more than two and one-half hours . When the nerve-wracking job was done they dropped exhausted on their cots . Everyone was congratulating Dr. Briggs , Dr. Kiess , and those who concurred with them in choosing this part of Brazil for the observations . Their judgment in locating the site well away from the cloudy weather of the coast had been fully vindicated . Two weeks later only two Army sergeants , James Kerns and George Williams , were left in the bare deserted clearing . They had volunteered to stay and guard Dr. Van @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they finally leave will our 1947 eclipse expedition really come to an end .  |
