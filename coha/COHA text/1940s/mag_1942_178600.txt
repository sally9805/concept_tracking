Comedian Jack Benny , to whom Comedian Bob Hope presented a special Oscar for being " sweater girl of the year " ( in Charley 's Aunt ) , got another present last week-not to be opened until autumn . Next season , Sponsor General Foods confessed , Benny will plug some other General Foods product , not the Jell-O with which he shares his present fame . Reason : JellO , being 60% sugar , may not be made nor sold in sufficient quantities to warrant the expensive exertions of Funnyman Benny , whose new two-year contract calls for a salary of $22,000 a week for 35 weeks-highest pay in radio . General Foods last week meditated giving Jell-O to Kate Smith , shunting Grape-Nuts Products to Benny . Benny was elaborately unconcerned . In an unprecedented deal last year he persuaded NBC to give him , not General Foods , a personal ten-year option on the choicest half-hour in radio ( Sun . 7 p.m . E.W.T. ) . He can take Grape-Nuts Products or leave them alone .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
