Again war secrecy blotted the President out of sight . His brief emergence to greet Queen Wilhelmina of The Netherlands had been only a breather . <P> The President conducted a press conference composed mainly of evasions ; conferred with soldiers and diplomats from the United Nations in the routine atmosphere of hush . What he was doing , where he went , what he was thinking , the public as usual was not told . Behind anonymity more complete than that of his passionately anonymous secretaries , the Cornmander in Chief wrestled with his troubles . On Dec. 9 , Franklin D. Roosevelt had told the nation : " If you feel that your Government is not disclosing enough of the truth , you have every right to say so . " Many U.S. citizens were saying so last week . But the President offered the people little but silence . Silently they waited , worked , wondered . They would have to get used to waiting , which is one of war 's big hardships .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
