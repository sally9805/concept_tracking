Last week Secretary of War Harry Hines Woodring addressed the nation on the subject of Moral Rearmament . He approved it . This surprised only those who think of the Secretary of War as a warlike character . Mr. Woodring is in fact a gentle character who asks only to be left at peace in his job . Said he last week in a speech over a coast-to-coast radio network : " Nations , like men , are their own worst enemies . The menacing might of human selfishness in every country is mankind 's chief danger . It is because the war to end selfishness has never been fought that the war to end wars has never been won . Our goal should be a new civilization , built not on the quicksands of personal and national self-interest but on the bedrock of personal wellbeing , national security and international peace and good will . " <P> These sentiments did credit to Dr. Frank Buchman , who first interested Mr. Woodring ( and many another Washington politico ) in moral reformation last spring . But , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm really not a Buchmanite . I think Moral Rearmament is a great , tremendous influence for good , and it ought to be encouraged . I 'm very strong for it . But I 'm not a convert . " Uplifted by a pile of commendatory messages and cablegrams from as far off as Ireland , Mr. Woodring then went back to his business of rearming the U. S. Army . The Secretary : <P> &gt; Sent his annual report to the President . This document told remarkably little about the Army . But Secretary Woodring did get at the main difference between the U. S. Army as it traditionally has been in peacetime , and the Army as Commander in Chief Roosevelt wants it to be from now on . The old Army was a feeble amoeba , unfit even for its theoretical role as the core of a fighting force to be raised after war starts . What is now wanted is an Initial Protective Force ( Regular Army plus National Guard ) , manned , equipped and ready to fight at the drop of an enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Whatever is the decision as to the size of our Army-our Initial Protective Force-450,000 , 500,000 or 600,000 , I must urgently insist that that force decided upon be complete as to personnel , as to materiel , and that it be 100% efficient as to training . Our Military Establishment must be an ' Army in Being ! ' " * <P> &gt; Announced that seven Air Corps observation squadrons , 260 of the Army 's 500 tanks would join the 50,000 Regulars receiving winter training in the south and southwest . This is the largest concentration of U. S. tanks , just ten more than the number of Russian tanks the Finns have destroyed in three weeks ' fighting ( see p. 20 ) . <P> &gt; Announced the formation of a new Air Corps unit , concentrating all defensive aircraft ( such as pursuit ships to drive off enemy bombers ) , anti-aircraft batteries , ground warning systems , in a single , centralized command . Hitherto these defensive functions have been scattered among Coast Artillery , Signal Corps , the Air Corps 's General Headquarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it was intended to be-a powerful , offensive striking arm for attack on enemy centres . <P> <P> * To Mr. Woodring 's Army in Being , upwards of 750,000 volunteers and conscripts would be added after war begins .
