Most Sears , Roebuck &; Co. stores are plain , functional buildings with big show windows and large , eye-hitting signs . But last week the mail-order chain opened a new store that was a sport ; it had only a few small windows and it looked like a citadel in Spain . Its single sign was restrained and inconspicuous . <P> That was the architectural price Sears paid to get into the Country Club District in Kansas City , Mo . The District is the second biggest , and , with its Plaza shopping center , the most successful privately run residential development in the U.S. Sears figured the price was small enough for a chance to tap the area 's purchasing power . Sears was right . Opening day , 100,000 potential customers came to gawk at the tile and ornamental grillwork . Many went inside and spent a total of $185,000 . <P> Raw Land . Such a performance was an old story to Jesse Clyde Nichols , long-range planner who has expanded a ten-acre plot into the Country Club 's 5,000 acres with 10,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five golf courses and 50,000 well-heeled residents . Nichols , who has proved himself a top city planner as consultant on scores of real estate developments , holds strong views on city planning and architecture . He habitually forced them on customers and tenants . <P> Again &; again he had proved that his well-integrated city-within-a-city ( it comprises the richest tenth of Kansas City 's residential area ) paid off : profits to merchants ; the good life to residents . <P> Nichols , son of a well-to-do Kansas storekeeper , first learned about neat , compact towns on a trip to Europe . At Harvard he wrote a thesis on the development of raw land . In 1904 , with $21,500 put up by farmers , he began to develop raw land himself at Olathe , Kans . <P> When the venture proved a success , he bought ten acres , then more , on the south side of Kansas City . With a partner , John Cyrus Taylor , now president of the J. C. Nichols Co . ( Nichols is chairman ) , he worked at building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the evening . <P> He restricted merchants to eleven compact areas , built them shopping centers ( against rent and a percentage of gross receipts ) in Spanish , Elizabethan and Colonial styles . Home builders got a choice of one of three areas ( large , medium-sized or small houses ) , where each could build a house according to his own pocket-book-and Nichols ' choice of architecture . <P> Decorated Town . In return , Nichols Studded the area with Grecian urns , Italian marble fountains , Spanish gates and birdbaths imported from Europe . Sixteenth Century Italian columns bought from the William Randolph Hearst collection adorn a Kroger superstore . Though these ginger-bready decorations are anathema to severely functional planners such as Frank Lloyd Wright , the Country Club residents like them . Despite his weakness for the 16th Century , Nichols has also pioneered some 20th Century improvements , such as shopping areas in outlying districts , parking lots , rigid zoning laws .
