The Speaker 's gavel pounded the desk . Cried the Speaker : " The time of the gentleman from New York has expired ! " But thin , grim Representative Mike Edelstein , fighting mad , talked on . <P> He was replying to Mississippi 's fuzzy-headed Representative John Elliott Rankin , No. 1 Jew-baiter of the House , who has busied himself lately trying to convince the House that the time is ripe for a negotiated peace between Britain and Germany . Rankin had just told a deathly-still House : " Mr. Speaker , Wall Street and a little group of our international Jewish brethren are still attempting to harass the President . . . and the Congress of the United States into plunging us into the European war , unprepared . . . . These international bankers are so afraid that this peace movement . . . might take root . . . before they can get us into it the war that on yesterday they held a rally in Wall Street and . . . made a plea to that effect . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York 's Edelstein jumped to his feet . Most popular of the six Jews in the House , esteemed by Democrats and Republicans alike , Mike Edelstein rarely made a speech , yet he was well equipped to answer this slur on his race . Born in Poland 53 years ago , brought to the U.S. when he was three , Mike Edelstein grew up on Manhattan 's East Side , studied law at night . After his good friend Dr. William I. Sirovich died in 1939 , Mike Edelstein took his seat in the House . Mild and devout , unmarried , he lived with his 85-year-old mother . <P> Cried Mike Edelstein : " Hitler started out by speaking about ' Jewish brethren . ' It is becoming the play and the work of those people who want to demagogue to speak about their ' Jewish brethren ' and ' international bankers . ' ... I deplore the idea that . . . men in this House . . . attempt to use the Jews as their scapegoat . I say it is unfair and I say it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gavel banged in vain as Mike Edelstein said his say . " All men are created equal , regardless of race , creed or color , and whether a man be Jew or Gentile , he may think what he deems fit . " <P> Then Mike Edelstein walked down the well of the House , out through the swinging glass doors into the Speaker 's lobby . In a corridor he stopped to speak to his secretary . Suddenly he slumped and fell against a door . From the lobby , Congressmen and attendants came running . <P> They were too late to help ; Michael Edelstein 's heart had stopped . The time of the gentleman from New York had expired .
