Cuba 's election of June 1 , which was encouragingly open &; aboveboard , almost resulted in a military dictatorship . The news came out last week . Two nights after frail , professorial Dr. Ramn Grau San Martin was elected President , his Vice President-elect Dr. Ral de Cardenas* trotted nervously across a shadowy lawn where U.S. Ambassador Spruille Braden was dining with friends . Drawing the Ambassador aside , he spluttered that rough , tough General Manuel Benitez , Chief of the National Police , planned to seize President Fulgencio Batista , prevent Grau from assuming the Presidency by setting up a military dictatorship . <P> Once he was sure that the danger was real , Ambassador Braden acted vigorously . Making a nice diplomatic distinction between " intervention " and " intercession , " he sent word to both Batista and Benitez that such undemocratic shenanigans were not in order . If Dr. Grau were kept from his lawful office , the U.S. would throw an airtight blockade around Cuba . <P> <P> Impressed by this warning , many of Benitez 's officer friends deserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At one formal gathering , in Ambassador Braden 's presence , Benitez denounced both Batista and Grau , kept calling each of them " cabrn " ( Cuban for son-of-a-bitch ) . Then Batista struck . He fired Benitez from the Army , packed him off to Miami . For Seor ( no longer General ) Benitez , Ambassador Braden issued a rush-order visa . <P> * Not to be confused with Mexican ex-President Lazaro Cardenas.
