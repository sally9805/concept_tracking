FROM ten to fifteen million men ? perhaps more ? will serve in the armed forces of the United States during this war . If not the largest body of fighting men ever mustered by a single nation , it will have been the most swiftly mobilized . Englishmen were trained for the sea ; conscription in France was traditional ; and every Russian youth had been taught to revere a place in the Red Army . As for the Axis powers , deification of the warrior ? from Mussolini 's inane " live dangerously " advice to Japanese hara-kiri after defeat ? is of course a leading doctrine . Not only were Americans physically untrained for combat , but the thought of ever participating in war was foreign to the two generations fighting or preparing to fight . Consequently the shift from civilian existence to life in barracks , on ship , and in bivouac tents was ten times more difficult than for the soldiers of any other nation . Many doubted that it could be accomplished , and no one has been more amazed than **25;111;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require that a soldier enjoy Army life ; high officers who during tours of inspection inquire of a man how he likes Army life do not appear displeased at forthright negative responses . In the pressing need for forging a powerful fighting instrument in the shadow of the enemy the recruit 's body is battered , his soul tried , his egocrushed ; and he realizes that his powers of physical and mental recuperation are beyond his wildest expectations . It is doubtful if the civilian , no matter how many war novels he has read or how careful his digestion of newspapers and magazines , ever gets much of an idea of life in the Army . The soldier writing home to his parents , his wife , his girl , or his children makes a few attempts at placing the whole complex situation ? his feelings , the new and strange things about him ? down on paper , and then he gives it up and confines himself to a few routine details before getting to intimate things . It will probably always be so ; a man can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he will never be able to explain adequately what he sees and feels after he gets there . Soldiers are well aware of the fact . We had read everything , yet from the day of induction we were in a foreign climate . I do not entertain any hope of suddenly clearing the atmosphere . It is only that the national experience ? the men going , their close ones seeing them go ? is so tremendous that every soldier , in a letter , in a moment to a friend , or in print , feels the necessity for making his small attempt . II sex day at induction stations for more than two years now the nation has been cut down the middle and its cross sections exposed . In the rural areas the county-seat lawyer , his office closed for the duration , lines up with the farmhand , the college boy with the lad who left high school to go to work in the garage . At Governor 's Island , where New York men were inducted prior to the opening of Grand Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in carnation and Homburg , sharing a bench with a Bowery bum who was sleeping off a jag . Zoot-suited youths mingled with muscular , o pen-shirted longshoremen . At that time men up to forty-five years were being called , and the two generations of the recruits were more discernible than ever . A solid , conservatively dressed man stood near a bareheaded Princeton student ? shift the scene , and the picture might be that of a father visiting his son on the campus . The dividing line between these generations falls at about twenty-nine or thirty years . Above this are the men who have some memory of the last war , who were jolted by the depression as they came of age , and who at last were becoming to some degree settled in their way of life . Below the line are the younger men ? the large majority ? who have greater stamina , are gayer , and on the whole are more adaptable . At the induction center there begins a lesson in the prime essential of Army life ? patience . The prospective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporal or a sergeant tries to put him into it , and he moves reluctantly , as in the civilian world . Naturally infuriated , the noncommissioned officer gives a sort of preview of what may be expected should tardiness be shown in the future . For the soldier wilt stand in line when he wants to eat , to be paid , to board a bus from camp ? in short , whenever he wants to do anything that more than a dozen others are intent upon doing . In time he will lie motionless for hours in his foxhole or other concealment or cover . Now he waits for his turn to be measured , weighed , tapped , questioned , and judged . In the mind of all is one question : " Shall I be accepted ? " In a room at the end of the line total strangers inquire of each other : " Did they take you ? " Men stuff red-stamped " rejection " papers into their pockets and stand aside : . dressing . slowly their thoughts theirown . Some can not hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( A frail lawyer who was placed in charge of my group from the draft board was turned down . Two weeks later at Camp Upton , the reception center , he bobbed up in uniform ; he had demanded re-examination and this time had gained entrance . ) Final touches are put to papers , and those accepted raise their right hands and become soldiers of the United States . We poured off the dark ferryboat into lower Manhattan 's streets , notices of time and place to report in our pockets , to swallow a last concentrated capsule of civilian life . In this war the passage of men into the Army is without much public fanfare . " The Rotary Club gives each man a candy bar and he gets on the bus and that 's the end of it , " a small-town veteran of Belleau Wood told me . Probably the fact that the men are taking a bus has something to do with it ? somehow it would be more fitting to take a brass band to the railway station . In more worldly New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pack of cigarettes and a booklet containing hints on how to get along in the Army . We shuffled down the subway steps , and to the homebound commuters rushing into Pennsylvania Station we were another of the endless lines of men waiting for troop trains . Once we were aboard , the wooden benches replacing cushioned seats reminded us of the Legion 's humorous offshoot , " Forty and Eight , " so named for French railway cars ' capacity of forty men and eight horses . At dusk the train rolled through Yaphank , and again there stirred in us vague recollections ? this time of Irving Berlin 's " Yip , Yip , Yaphank , " and another generation of soldiers who sang it . The swiftness with which America has mobilized its vast manpower became clear to us for the first time at the reception center . In the innocence of our civilian pasts we had believed that we should be put to bed until , fresh and clear-minded , we were aroused for aptitude tests , and , in good time , fitted for uniforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lieutenant told several hundred of us gathered in a long warehouse . We were split up according to initials of our last names ; I have since seen not a single one of six acouaintances who were with me , and of the four I have heard from no two are in the same branch of service . We K 's set our traveling bags and our overnight cases and our brown-paper bundles in the barracks streets assigned to us , marched into our first mess hall , and marched out again to the testing buildings . After some hours of forcing brains fatigued by sending-away celebrations to cope with strange aptitude problems , we retrieved our civilian relics and crept to bunks assigned us ? to be up a couple of hours before dawn . The general details of a soldier 's classification by the Army are now pretty well known . He is interviewed and his employment record , his schooling , his grades on aptitude tests , and other more or less intimate facts of his life are noted down on a card which accompanies him wherever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best niche he can fill in the Army . Confusing himself slightly with Sergeant Quirt , he is taken to a movie on sex hygiene ? where ushers are stationed about to carry him out in case he faints . In due time he stuffs a barracks bag with shoes , hats , half a dozen assorted uniforms , overcoat , raincoat , leggings , etc. , which , due to an intricate system of sizings , fit him remarkably well . ( Few soldiers keep their civilian shapes for very long . ) As the line approaches the inoculation section , veterans of half a day 's longer service call out in frightening tones , " Watch the hook , watch out for the hook . " ( This phrase appears to be a colloquialism peculiar to the East , but everywhere there are men who double with laughter upon warning recruits of the supposed terrors of the needle . ) Less than twenty-four hours after enter-ing the reception center we had boxed our civilian clothes and sent them home . We caught such glimpses of our uniformed figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did not look to ourselves much like soldiers , the Army thought that we came close enough ; for since reception centers depend largely on recruits for roustabout labor we were wanted at once for duty . Thus on the second day of their Army careers men found themselves on kitchen police . For my part , after being linifnrmPTI. and inoculated . I was induced to plod to a warehouse for an eight-hour hitch unpacking boxes and counting barracks bags . None of us doubted that we had entered upon a new life . A soldier never speaks of himself , unless he is an officer or has been in the service long enough to be given special missions , as being " sent " anywhere . He is shipped . When non-commissioned officers came through barracks calling out names of men wanted for shipment I assumed that they were to go to the warehouse , as I had , to load or unload equipment or foodstuffs . It developed that once a man has been classified and outfitted he waits until his name appears on the typed shipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulletin board in the barracks in which he has been sleeping . At 4 A.M. he is asked by a noncommissioned officer ? who , unless he has a powerful and penetrating voice , has just blown a whistle ? to arise and look at the list . If his name is on it ? usually it is there within one to three days ? he distributes his new belongings between his two barracks bags , and , hanging them in balance over his shoulders , he joins a new line . Because some men fail to see their names on the lists , causing non-commissioned officers to go through the barracks and the streets shouting for them , and because of the time taken in checking equipment , it is usually evening before the station is reached . When the soldier rides back into Pennsylvania Station two , three , perhaps four days after his departure , a unit in the endless line of men with barracks bags and awkward in new uniforms , he already feels himself a long way from the civilian world . For a million men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter what their later experiences . All about are the hurrying figures of men in mufti going home , the flashing silk stockings and the clicking high heels of women . He shifts scenes in his mind : his memory of himself in the civilian throng noting the duffel-bag-laden soldiers ; himself now in that line gazing upon the civilians . Lonely , unaware of his destination or even the branch of service to which he is going , he grips the iron handholds of the train and swings himself and his barracks bags silently aboard . Strangers destined to Iive side by side are not long in beginning to feel one another out in preparation for adjustment one to the other . The task among new soldiers is complicated by the fact that the conventional knobs by which to get hold of a man 's personality are lacking . Men can not he judged by clothing , since it is new and strange to them , nor by the manner in which they wear it , since for a while they will certainly wear it badly . Even facial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that tired men will curl up on the seats or ? if slated for a very long trip ? in their berths and sleep while the train speeds out across the country , direction unknown . The first meal helps more than anything else to break clown the barriers . In an express or freight car the cooks have set up a long low range , banked earth about it , and stoked it with lengths of firewood . The stovepipe hung from the roof and passed out the door is only fairly adequate , and the cooks and the KP 's work half-naked in the smoke and steam . But the food , washed down with hot coffee , works miracles . Names , occupations , home towns , streets , and hundreds of other bits of information are exchanged . Men who a few hours before were heartily sick of one another 's faces have started friendships which will blossom in the months ? perhaps years ? ahead . A few poker games are started . But the major pastime is that of guessing the destination . Terrain is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities are noted . Some men draw maps of the nation and attempt , from their sketchy information , to establish their position on it . Pools are organized , each man choosing a camp according to his best judgment . At last the outskirts of the actual camp are reached and the men adjust themselves to the knowledge that they are to be in the Air Corps , the Engineers , Infantry , the MP 's , Signal Corps , Chemical Warfare , mechanized outfits . Barracks bags riding their shoulders , they climb down from the train under the scrutiny of officers and non-commissioned officers assigned to train them ? officers and non-coms anxious to see what manner of potential soldiers they have drawn . After a hot meal in the mess hall and assign-ment to barracks each man seizes pencil and paper to spread news of his whereabouts . III lir , standard barracks is a roomy , two- storey structure , usually painted white , with two small rooms at either end but with the majority of the floor space devoted to single or double-decker iron cots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early rising would disturb the greater room . A wide stairway enters the building at the side near one end and ascends to the second storey . At this end , and a few feet lower than the first floor , is the soldier 's combination drawing-room , meeting hall , and information center ? the latrine . Here originate the latrine rumors , which account for about one-half the soldier 's conversation , and here the recruit is taught the magic results of Government Issue ( GI ) brushes and soap applied vigorously to white porcelain . Here , and on the familiar boards of the barrack rooms floors , he masters the Army 's valuable precision tool , the mop . He rails at scoundrels from other barracks who steal his mops ; and finally utterly unscrupulous himself , he crawls out in dead of night to steal others . On a mopless morning , the breath of the inspecting officer hot on their necks , sergeants themselves go wheedling to sergeant friends in other barracks , and find those friends false . The sanctity of a man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army law and tradition is the soldier 's bunk his castle . It must of course be made correctly , the floor about it swept and mopped every day , and clothes and personal belongings arranged on shelves and in the trunkiike foot lockers according to regulations . But round his bunk the soldier raises substantial if invisible walls inside which he retires as the king to his intimate chambers . With the men about him he eventually establishes the neighborly relations of a farmer . When he rises early for KP a neighbor makes his bed ; should he fall ill someone steals extra oranges from the mess hall or carries ice cream from the Post Exchange . Having established his home to his liking , the humblest private becomes a lion before a sergeant trying to move him to another barracks or even to a point a few bunks distant . But the settling of strangers , of widely varying temperaments , of different backgrounds , into anything like a peaceful communal life is not easy . Men of my own outfit came about equally from New York and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was some tendency toward clannishness . The Southerners , more homesick than the others , stayed close together , in leisure hours leaning moodily on their breast-high , double-decker bunks . Occasionally there would come a snatch or two of a hill ballad . one man sang dolefully and repeatedly . He expected to confine himself to a single line , he said , until letters arrived from home . Subsequent lines , it turned out , had more cheer in them . For a while officers and non-coms referred to " the Southerners " and " the New York men , " but this became less common as personalities and abilities began to emerge . Nor do differences in ages cause much difficulty . It is true that younger men , particularly if of gregarious nature , find adjustment easier ? perhaps little harder than at college or a summer camp . Older men have had a considerably more difficult time of it and , particularly in basic training , where men of forty-five have undergone the same rigorous training as youths of twenty , many have suffered greatly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it has been , psychologically , as if everything had gone to smash and they were reduced to the honorable but unfamiliar occupation of digging ditches . They do however have the advantage of a generally larger perspective , which helps them to overcome physical handicaps . Since heroics are rare and unpopular ? men like to joke about the " board of friends and neighbors , " who according to draft notices , " selected " them for service ? younger men have concluded that their elders are not well suited for the hard life of soldiers and consequently no stigma is attached to over-age men who seek to be discharged . The rough edges which have to be worn off result , in the main , from the wide variance in men 's temperaments . The great cleavage is over the matter of noise in barracks . Some men indubitably like noise ; take it away and they suffer . Their opponents , members of the quiet camp , are at a disadvantage for the obvious reason that quiet disturbs the noisemaker for only the time it takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn on his radio . Unfortunately the American custom of allowing the radio to go full blast , no matter what the program , is carried into the barracks . The noise lover has another advantage in that , lacking sensitivity to what goes on about him , he may disturb a score of men without even knowing it ; while each of the others hesitates to complain for fear of getting a reputation as a grouch . Some men do not care much about the noise either way , preferring at first to withdraw within themselves , living as far as possible in the past . They are the letter writers . They sit obscurely on foot lockers during the daytime , when they must keep off their hunks , and they sit or lie on their bunks before lights-out . In their laps , serving as desks , arc stationery boxes or writing folders , and they scribble endlessly . Sometimes they achieve an almost terrifying efficiency . One man who lived near the top of the stairs worked out a system which permitted him to write letters even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gallon tin can which served as a receptacle for cigarette butts . When he heard the approach of the sergeant from downstairs ( which was easy , for the sergeant was always shouting orders behind him ) he would seize the butt can and patter down to the latrine , ostensibly to empty the can . This procedure was repeated several times each morning . The sergeant never caught on , and the man 's neighbors , somehow recognizing that he had a problem to work out with himself , did not complain . In time a sort of armistice is worked out between the noise lovers and the quiet men . Gradually the noise lovers come to realize that they are not alone in the barracks ; and of course the step from theft of mops to sabotage of radios is relatively short . One soldier , disturbed by two men who conversed long after lights-out , grew tired of asking them to be quiet . He awakened them an hour before reveille one 1110I-11111g ? their favorite hour of rest and insisted on chatting until the bugle sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had not been able to realize that others wanted to sleep when they did not . Magazines fill up their pages with what has been palmed off on editors as picturesque Army slang . It is a waste of paper . A few common expressions are used ? for example , a loafer is sometimes referred to , mostly by recruits , as a goldbricker ; soldiers who draw menial details are occasionally referred to as yardbirds ; meals are commonly called chow ; a bad report or a mild bawling out is a gig . Officers have originated a term for other officers who at unexpected moments appear to check their work . They call them submarines , and criticism on some point or another is torpedoing . " I was subrnarined three times to-day and torpedoed twice , " one officer will report half dejectedly , half jokingly to another . But the real Army language will never be known to good folks . It is unprintable and unrepeatable in polite circles , though wondrously rich and varied . Much of it comes from the old Army , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The tone of the average soldier 's language goes down about thirty per cent during his early days in the service , and then it mounts toward the normal , without ever quite reaching it . Only a limited number have the memory , the imagination , and the desire really to master the Army vocabulary . The point at which a man ceases to think of himself as a recruit can not be placed exactly , but in most cases it comes with the firing of the small weapons toward the end of his basic training . By that time the original aches and pains have vanished . His muscles are hard and he has spring in his step . He has gained a little weight or lost a great deal . He feels right , even jaunty , in his uniform . He knows his duties and , if he performs them adequately , his fear of non-coms and officers has evaporated . It is the firing of the actual weapons of war however that permits him to feel that he is at last on the way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifles and sidearms in civilian life , and the percentage who have never even had a gun in their hands is high . It is found that the kick of the gun is not so overwhelming as had been expected ; bull's-eyes are hit at surprising distances . Mastery of machine guns , artillery , planes , and other weapons or tools of whatever branch they are assigned to lies ahead . Farther away is the greatest experience of all ? going into battle . But each is well aware that he is not the same man who reported to the induction station on the day which seems to him a long time ago . 1/ TN EVERY war , and afterward , civilians . ' ? " and soldiers have some trouble understanding one another . Not long ago a debate was started by Sergeant Jimmy Cannon , not a particularly profound writer , when he declared in his column for PM that " Soldiers are only civilians in uniform . " He was roundly denounced ? chiefly by civilians . One of his sterner critics , a New Yorker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a general review of pieces written by soldiers and printed in the New Republic , to set him straight . " The civilian , " Hyman stated , " is a man devoted to being happy , holding a job , getting ahead , reproducing his kind , and so on . The soldier , like the tank , is a machine devoted solely to killing , and there is no other point to his life , at least while he is a soldier . " Rather grumpily , he went on to say that , while soldiers were not civilians in uniform , various men who had written about the Army ? E. J. Kahn , Jr. , Marion Hargrove , Cannon , etc. ? were civilians in uniform because they had merely gone through adjustment to military life , had not yet seen battle . Hyman 's comments are not entirely lacking in truth , but I quote them chiefly because they express an attitude , generally unconscious , of a great many civilians . There is a tendency to think of the soldier as a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be nicked un after the war is over . " After all , " the soldier is told a thousand times over , " your day is all planned out for you ; you do n't have to think . " There are other clich ? s which , unless something is done about them , may well result in a general massacre of parents , sweethearts , wives , and bosom friends of soldiers . Worst of all is the inane , " Well , how do you like the Army ? " ? a comment admittedly as difficult to avoid as mention of the weather . Probably the soldier does n't like Army life at all , and yet he would not be out of it ? anyhow , the way he feels is a long story which he does not want to tell and which , in most cases , the questioner does n't want to hear . Another favorite is to remark that , with food rationing and all , a man is better off these days in the Army than out . Army food is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratio to the cooks ' abilities , palatable ; but it is a rare soldier who would not sacrifice quantity for choice , timing , and serving conditions . The list of clich ? s could be continued indefinitely . The soldier is not impressed by the Arrow Collar drawings of his supposed self in the advertisements , nor by the glory-writing of the hacks ? material which seems to be aimed at the civilian market . He has little patience , for that matter , with glory-writing about civilians . One extreme example of this sort of thing was the great rumpus raised about movie and radio stars who remained " heroically " at microphones for some fourteen or more hours a day pleading with listeners to buy war bonds , even going so far as to allow the patriotic laity to speak personally with them over the telephone . An ecstatic radio reporter for the New York World-Telegram compared the efforts of Charles Laughton favorably with those of Stalin-grad 's defenders . Fourteen hours is a relatively short shift for KP duty . The soldier would prefer that high-pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first person . Given even fighting conditions , American soldiers feel they will conduct themselves as well as others , perhaps a little better , but there is no sign of the old " one Yank can handle ten " attitude . Consequently Hollywood movies are often jeered , though on this no ; nt I would not want to sneak from the point of view of the general morale . I recall one movie in which John Wayne , portraying a swashbuckling American hero , took on a belligerent simper , called a Gestapo officer " hub , " and knocked him down . ( In the movies a Hollywood star is always worth a division . ) The men who cheer Gene Autry , Buck Jones , and Errol Flynn cheered ; others laughed . On the other hand , it may very well appear to civilians that soldiers and sailors on excursions back into civilian life are demanding and even a little overbearing . If so it is because the man away from his camp or his ship is in a hurry . For days , weeks , months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked forward to his hours away . When he finds that he can not secure a hotel room , board a train , buy liquor , get into a show , or do numerous other things he has planned he is naturally upset . I have noticed however that , probably owing to practice , the patience of soldiers as a rule surpasses that of civilians . On one train traveling far across country I counted one hundred soldiers and sailors in a coach which was without washing facilities of any kind ; the next car was a Pullman , containing eighteen comfortable chairs . The conductor complained that he had a hard time keeping the soldiers and sailors out of the Pullman washroom ; and no wonder . This may sound as if men in military service were preoccupied with criticism of the civilian population or at least some of its manifestations ? which is not true . It is only that Sergeant Cannon is to a considerable extent right . No one would prefer more than the soldier that he become a sort of tank for the duration ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not work out that way . The civilian-soldier early had a profound effect on the Army , as indicated by the wide currency of the terms " old Army , " and " new Army . " The American Army never was cut on the Prussian pattern , but certain castes did exist . The first three grades of sergeants ? master , tech , and staff ? held themselves aloof from other enlisted men , while " buck " sergeants and corporals fraternized little with privates . In the small force several years were required to rise from private to corporal . Men came to attention when the first sergeant walked into the barracks , and it was necessary while talking with him in the orderly room to stand at attention , while the appendage of " sir " to the sentence was only good judgment . To rise from the ranks was next to impossible . The change was gradual at first , but the flood of new men beat at the bulwarks of the " old Army " traditions and , with the implicit and sometimes explicit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . The top-kick is a man to respect , but his pedestal is gone . Perhaps two-thirds of the members of the armed forces have never had a harsh word spoken to them , except in general warnings to groups . " Army regulations , " a saying goes , " are for men who can not live without them " ? by which it is meant that some men need constant pressure to ensure that they accomplish their tasks . Emphasis is placed on leadership . The non-corn who constantly hands out extra duty or other punishment is more likely to get a reputation for incompetency than for efficiency . Men who try to play the movie version of the hard-boiled non-corn often find themselves broken or refused a rise in rank . It is not uncommon for unfair non-coms to be ostracized socially by other non-coms as well as by their own men . The general disrespect for the lower ranks of commissioned officers , particularly second lieutenants , which was often observed in the last war is not likely to be a feature of this one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers . Theymarch the same distances , eat the same food , and are subjected to even harder duties . In combat they face equal , or greater , dangers . In officer-candidate schools greater emphasis is placed on leadership and ability to get along with others than on high scholastic marks . Students are called on to grade one another in character and judgment in human relations . ( It is well to remark that old Army officers and non-coms-become-officers found no difficulty in adjusting themselves to the new scheme . ) Everything published about the Army by the gurgle writers is not accurate , but it is true that the spirit of camaraderie is encouragingly strong . This is not to say that discipline is lacking or that soldierly conduct is not required . The difference is that the American fighting man is permitted to remain an individual . That is good , and the more efficient way . The civilian-soldier could not , even if he wanted to , put aside his past . He will remember the world he left , and in his mind will always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he wants to return . Toughening of the mind is no less important than strengthening of the body . The soldier needs the issues of the war constantly placed before him ; he needs to see films and read factual , realistic , and well-prepared literature ; he knows that he must accustom himself to the possibility of death . But it is no good to expect him to become a cold , emotionless fighting machine . Americans will have to fight as they are .
