txt Not All Covered by Health Insurance VINCENT R. STAATS . Letters to . The - Times Not All Covered by Health Insurance To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : With regard to a recent editorial , you should be aware of the fact that both the Board of Education and the city transit system are excluded from participation in the Health Insurance Plan , due to " lack of funds . " The writer and other non-participating employes feel that a correction is in order , unless you may feel disposed to assist us in securing the benefits to which your editorial alluded as already accomplished by Mayor O'Dwyer 's Administration . VINCENT R. STAATS . St. Albans , N. Y. , April 19 , 1947 . Our editorial on Mayor O'Dwyer 's accomplishments said that " the pay of city employes , including teachers , nurses , transit workers and others , was raised , and a health insurance plan for them was set up . " Our correspondent is in error in saying that Board of Education employes are excluded . Albert Pleydell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health Insurance Plan , states that all city employes except those in the Board of Transportation are eligible to join the plan , with the city paying half of the charges for their membership . We believe that transit employes should also be covered , and urge extension of the health insurance benefits to them. ? Editor , THE TIDIES.
