txt Trucking throughout Greater Boston continued to be disrupted today as leaders of Local 25 of the Teamsters International Union stood by their decision to . reject arbitration until an offer is made by the employers . Hope that the local 's meeting tomorrow would vote for arbitration of the wage issue was virtually eliminated last night by James V. Hurst , President of the local . " We do not propose to recede from our position until some counter offer is made by the employers , " Mr. Hurst stated . At , the same time , however , he said tomorrow 's meeting would be urged to bring an immediate halt to all violence and keep the highways open to all authorized trucking . The meeting also will seek ways to improve the handling of food and other essentials during the walkout , he said . " Our men walked off the job for a just cause , and we do not propose to abandon that cause , " he asserted . " Any report that I or any other officer of the local has offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Solution Fades With both sides equally insistent that the other make the first move toward agreement , prospects of a solution coming from the meeting by both sides on Jan. 13 appeared removed , unless there is a change of policy in the meantime . The union officials and representatives of the Employers Group of Motor Freight Carriers will gather around a conference table presided over by Prof. Douglass Brown of Massachusetts Institute of Technology , appointed Moderator by Governor Bradford . If the deadlock continues after that meeting , the Governor will have to decide whether or not to carry out his threat of having the National Guard take over the operation of the trucking firms on Friday , Jan. 16 . In one respect , the strike picture has improved . Although the Attorney General 's office received 22 complaints from drivers or concerns whose trucks were stopped on highways by pickets , none mentioned violence . George B. Rowell , First Assistant Attorney General , said more than 200 complaints had been received in the three days prior to that , many of them reporting violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 6,000 AFL drivers , is being hampered by an evident Inability of the two sides to agree on what should be arbitrated . The union has refused thus far to arbitrate wages . It has appeared willing , however , to have other conditions settled by an impartial board . The employers group has gone on the record as willing to arbitrate wages , but only if the union accepts the rest of the old contract without such arbitration . Additional misunderstanding prevails on the matter of wages . Union spokesmen claim the drivers are paid an average of $43 or S45 a week under a contract ealling for between $51 and $55.15 for 48 hours . The employers contend that the drivers now average 569 a week . $65 Sought The union is seeking $65 for 40 hours . Meanwhile , the dispute took on a new aspect yesterday when 11 unaffiliated New Hampshire trucking firms filed affidavits with the National Labor Relations Board in Boston , charging Local 25 with stopping their drivers . If this should be proven true , experts say it would constitute an unfair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bernard L. Alpert , New England Regional Director of the Board , can ask the Federal court for injunctions if investigation backs up the charges . Under the same provision of the labor law , the companies could sue the union for damages . While the dispute continued , the union announced that 121 trucking firms had signed contracts granting $65 for a 40-hour week .
