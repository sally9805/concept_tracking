Inside a barbed-wire enclosure , where the crews of a troop carrier squadron were confined like some kind of rare and precious birds , a whistle skirled . Pilots , copilots , navigators turned out , listened to the briefing . They squinted at the sky . It was a squally night with a fitful , pale moon . <P> The Briefing Was Over . The men climbed into trucks , whipped off to the airfield . Already a clattering rumble spread across the night-hung countryside : engines on the warmup . They piled out of the trucks at the darkened stations and went to work . <P> Paratroops , grotesque and awkward in their equipment , climbed into the C-47 transport planes . In swift succession the aircraft took off and crawled up toward the cloudy sky . With formation lights on because of the dense traffic , a parade of transports , gliders , tow planes , which in single file would have stretched more than 200 miles , droned across the English Channel . <P> In the carriers the paratroops dozed , or pretended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys - lean , wiry men clad in green camouflaged battle dress , faces stained with cocoa and linseed oil . ( " We 'll have something to eat if our rations run out . " ) They carried the fanciest arms , and the most primitive . <P> Near midnight the first planes reached their objective near Cherbourg . Men snapped their rip cords over static lines , waited , crouching . The command came , and they leaped . White , yellow and red parachutes blossomed in the night . Men by the thousands , weapons by the thousands floated down upon captive France . <P> Sweepers . Across the Channel another fleet moved-an ungainly motley of fishing trawlers , old coal-burners and new , specially designed craft . Their dirty , dangerous chore : to sweep the waters clear of mines . They moved with care , ploughing the Channel in straight furrows towards the coast , where midget submarines for the past three days had laid out beach markers . They went to work . <P> German coastal guns barked . The coast flamed and thundered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The hell that flared as the minesweepers worked was raised by the most savage bombing in history . <P> Climaxing a steady , 96-hour bombardment , a thousand Fortresses and Liberators rained explosives , pinpointing German installations in the uncertain light . <P> Medium bombers and fighter bombers swept low , peppering the countryside , shooting up an occasional enemy tank . Fighters strafed while others circled overhead . The Luftwaffe , either unwilling or unable to fight against such odds , stayed on the ground . It even passed up its chance at the Allied warships , which followed in the wake of minesweepers , wheeled into line and added their terrible blows . <P> Battleships , cruisers , destroyers stood off the coast , wrapped themselves in smoke screens and hurled steel from 640 guns . They arrived in two divisions . On the east they were British and Canadian vessels under the command of Rear Admiral Sir Philip Vian . On the west they were U.S. , under the command of Rear Admiral Alan G. Kirk . Never before , not at Tarawa or Kwajalein or Salerno @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from air and sea .
