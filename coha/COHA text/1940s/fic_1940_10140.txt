DEATI-I THUMBS A RIDEthough I hardly more than glanced at the other I had a distinct impression that she was an older , droopy sort of person who was chewing gum steadily . In the center of the room four people , a touring family , I imagined , were eating at one of the tables . I asked the proprietor how far we were from Mount George . " I do n't know , but I 'd say Mount George was twenty-five miles from here , more or less . You 'd better stop and ask at Everett , if you 're going up the mountain , it 's not much settled . " I thought it was fortunate we had not pushed on into unsettled country we did n't know , it might have been hours before we 'd found Perkins ' house . I considered telephoning him , but remembered we had said Wednesdayor Thursday ; time enough to call him tomorrow if we were delayed longer . I glanced at the clock above the counter and just as I did the big second hand swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine . The redheadedboy at the table cried , " Look , Sis ! You told Jed we 'd all be in bed by now ! I heard you on the ' phone  --  " " Be still ! " his sister interrupted rather sharply . " You 're so noisy ! " " Aw , you 're just mad ! I 'll bet you 're planning  --  " " Never mind , now , " the mother spoke firmly . " You are going to be in bed in about ten minutes , both of you ! " She added to her husband , " The Strongs here again ! " despondently . I had reached the door and heard no more . THE " HOME FROM HOME " CAMP 21I found Hale on the narrow porch of the cabin . " I 'm afraid I 'll have to bunk with you , if you do n't mind , " he said . " If Eunice really gets to sleep and can sleep until morning , she may be all right ; otherwise we may be held up here another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than one night at this place . I looked around it at the dark , dismal little shacks  --  only one , at the other end , showing a light inside  --  and thought of the contrast with what we had expected that night , a warm lighted house with friends waiting for us , something to drink by an open fire , some good talk , and a book to take to bed . I did n't care , either , to share my bed with Hale , whom I 'd never seen two days before , so I told him with more cordiality than was necessary that the arrangement , so far as I was concerned , could not be better , and that if there should be anything I could do for him or Mrs. Hale not to hesitate to wake me up . The last proved to be a figure of speech only . The bed was comfortable , the sheets smooth and fresh , the pillow sufficiently hard , and yet I could n't sleep . In the first place , people began to come into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be getting drowsy when some noise roused me . Headlights flashed into the windows , motors raced , gears crashed , and voices called as people settled themselves for the night . Once or twice from further away I heard laughter , and once someone singing . At another time I probably should n't have paid any attention to any of it , but now and then Hale cursed softly , afraid his wife would be disturbed , and it might have been my fear of the same thing that kept me uneasy . She made22 DEATl1 .1 . IIUMBS A RIDEcomplaints once in a while , and he was up half a dozen times to look after her . But at last I must have gone to sleep , for there was a period in which Mrs. Hale 's restless murmurs ceased , when I heard nothing at all , and was riding again in the back seat of the car . Then  --  it might have been three in the morning  --  I was suddenly and tinglingly awake again . For some reason 1 felt that it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For several seconds there was nothing but silence , the perfect silence that comes just before daybreak . The room was in such black darkness that for a while I could n't find the pale square on my side of it that had been a window when I went to sleep . It confused me ; I could n't tell in which direction the outside door was , or the door to the other room . I waited ; I knew I should hear something , and beforelong it came  --  an oddly familiar sound I could n't place . It was like something being brushed slowly , or dragged along a thick rug . It ended abruptly with a froglike , metalic croak . My ears were strained to locate its direction , when I was startled by a moan which seemed to come from nowhere . It must be Mrs. Hale , I thought , but why was it so close to me ? I held my breath this time  --  waiting  --  , and there came a longer groan . The night air was suddenly very cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that before , I was sure . Her complaintshad been those of a young , ordinarily healthy and somewhat spoiled woman against unaccustomed pain . This was something I dreaded to hear again . There was a tragic resignation in it , as though the sufferer realized there would be no help for her . I put out my hand , HaleTHE " HOME FROM HOME " CAMP 23was not there . Did that mean it was Mrs. Hale I 'd heard ? Before I had more than put the question to myself I heard another sound , a long , shivering " Oh-h-h-h " of unbearablepain , which ended in an animal-like cry of mortal agony ; a gurgling seemed to choke it off and I was horrified . " Good God ! " I muttered , sitting up abruptly , " she must be dying ! " I listened again . But all I heard now was a slight rustle , as though someone walked , outside ; then a decided sniff and the whimper of a dog . There was nothing to indicate that another human , besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get up when the door between the rooms opened and Hale came in . I could see a little better now , and reached for my slippers as I asked , " How is she ? " " Better , I think . She 's still making a bit of noise now and then ; did it wake you up ? " Did she wake me up ? I did n't know . I still felt prickly , as though I had just waked from a horrible nightmare . I heard Hale yawn , and he struck a match and fumbled for cigarettes , knocking over a glass of water on the table where he had left them . Then he went into the lavatory with the glass , and turning on the water let it run , though it had been ice-cold the night before . I hoped that if Mrs. Hale were asleep he would n't disturb her . I got up too , and prowled about as cautiously as I could . I got my own cigarettes and matches and went out onto the shelf-like porch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a quick patter and a little dog jumped onto the end of the porch and trotted up to me. 24 I ) I:n'I'II TIIUMBS A RIDE " I kilo ! " I said , stooping to pat the smooth head , " I thought you were a big dog , you made so much noise walking around out here a minute ago . " I strolled up and down , smoking and thinking . It occurredto me that this dog might have heard those groans too , and that was why he had whimpered . I walked to first one and then the other end of the shelf and gazed towards the cabin on either side of us . Though it seemed to be pitch dark there was enough faint light in the sky to be reflected in the gloss on the hoods of the cars parked in their cubbyholes . The one on the left was ours . The other one had been there when we went to bed . Gradually the tension left my body . I thought I began to understand what had happened . The trap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or fifteen years ago , when I 'd read that old story , and at any time when I was sufficiently tired and found myself in a situation anything like that old plot , the trap would be sprung . I had behavedlike a hysterical fool , I decided . Mrs. Hale had groaned louder than she had before , and it had been intensifiedand colored by that thick darkness in which I had been lost ; that was all there was to it . And yet  --  and yet  --  Well , I would n't think of it any longer , I was going to sleep . I went back to bed , and I refused to move or think after I got there . When I opened my eyes again the sun was bright in the window . My watch said eight-thirty . Hale , already dressed , stood in the open door . He looked around and said , " I 've investigated the eating-place down there , and I think we can get a decent cup of coffee . Want to try it ? " THE " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shower they advertise out in front ? " " Better leave it alone . There 's hot water in the pipes here , though , and plenty of towels . " I asked then about Mrs. Hale and he said she seemed to be sound asleep . " You can leave her ? " " Oh , yes . She wo n't wake up for a while . " In twenty minutes we closed the door quietly behind us and walked down to the restaurant . Both of us stared a little at the handsome limousine standing on the gravel before the door , with a chauffeur in the driver 's seat . Even for so unpretentious a place there seemed to be very poor management inside , for the tables were n't set and there was no one in attendance . The proprietor , however , was behind his counter talking to a good-looking young fellow in dark clothes , whose face was pale and whose eyes betrayed that he was in trouble of some sort . He looked as though he had n't slept . But he had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future overweight , which is supposed to accompany an easy-going disposition . The two men went on talking in low tones without looking at us , to the unconcealed disgust of Hale , who was in a hurry . He was about to demand attention when the young woman of the night before came hurrying in with a tablecloth and silver and began to set places for us . " Sorry to keep you waiting , we 're behindhand this morning . " She looked pale and tired too . We gave our order and had the place to ourselves until she came back , for the other men had gone outside when she came in . " Everybody 's upset this morning , " she told us as shez6 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEput our eggs and bacon on the table . " Was it you who wanted the toast , sir ? I 'm sorry , here are the muffins . " The coffee was fairly good and we drank it gratefully . I thought I saw a truck go by the window beside our table and glanced out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good Lord ! " he exclaimed . " What 's a hearse doing here ? " He put down his knife and fork as though he had lost his appetite . I turned towards our waitress and saw her quickly and almost furtively cross herself . She explained without reluctance , " We had someone die here last night . It never happened before . It 's upset us terrible ! " " That 's too bad , " I murmured as Hale said nothing . " One of your guests ? " She waved a hand in the direction of our cabin . " Yes a woman down there in a double cabin . She had acute indigestion , I guess . The doctor 's there now , but it 's too late for the poor soul . All night her husband worked with her , except when he went to get medicine , ' bout half-past twelve , and then we  --  " I Talc 's chair rasping over the 800r halted her . His face had gone perfectly white . I sat staring and hardly noticed him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why  --  what 's the matter with him ? Is he sick ? " The girl 's face was so distressed that I was sorry for her and tried lamely to explain that he 'd forgotten something , that he 'd be back , that he was n't feeling well , all a mixture of unintelligible words and phrases that only half reassuredher . I picked up my fork and began pushing and THE " HOME FROM HOME " CAMP 27turning my food and she walked away . I saw that she was watching me and I swallowed a few mouthfuls , thinking hard as I did . She made me jump when she spoke again . " Would you like some more coffee , sir ? " " Yes , thank you . Which cabin did you say the woman died in ? " " One of those up there by the bank ; why , that 's where you were , is n't it ? Well , it never rains but it pours . Yesterdaywe was all at sixes and sevens on account of that storm , the day before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  no current , you know  --  and everything went sour on me . They got it fixed about noon and I give you my word I was n't out'a the kitchen all morning  --  trying to save some of the food . I 'll get your coffee . Will the other gentleman be back , do you think ? Shall I try to keep his breakfast warm for ' im ? " " No  --  yes , perhaps that would be the best thing to do . " It would give her something to think about , anyhow , besidesus . I forgot to eat when she had left the room , for I had something to think about too , at least I thought I should have but I did n't know what it was . I had a confused , hurried feeling as though there were a name I must rememberright away , and could n't . One thing was clear , I had heard someone die in the night ; it had not been a morbid imagination . Then , suddenly , the affair moved back from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the strain slackened . And if there had been a death , and if I had heard the last despairing protest of Life , what then ? 28 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEWhy should I get the wind up about it ? Had I got a habit of looking for drama  --  mystery  --  in everything that happened ? Did I want to find something macabre in the death of this poor woman because I was tired and thereforebored ? That was a most disagreeable thought . But still I was n't satisfied to let the whole thing go . I 'd tell Perkins , tell the story in every detail , and let him make what he could of it . Having come to this conclusion I felt better , and ate a little breakfast . I was still eating when I heard voices outside the door . One I recognized as my host 's , the others were different , assured and wellbred , and too low-pitched to be recognizable even had I known them . Then a new voice , nasal and penetrating , said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here right away , I do n't think I could 've done anything . " Next I heard a car drive off and the proprietor , whose name  --  I learned later  --  was Teggart , came back in . " That , " he said importantly , " was Governor Metcalf  --  you 've probably heard of him  --  and his own doctor he brought here . Just to see about that woman who died here last night . " I had met the Governor , of our state , incidentally , and not Teggart 's , at the Perkins ' house . He was not a man one should have expected to find at this camp . InvoluntarilyI had exclaimed , " The Governor ! That 's  --  " and stopped . " Yeah ! It 's a surprise , all right , to find him in a place like this , ai n't it ? " There was nothing to say , I thought , to this . THE " HOME FROM HOME " CAMP 29 " Well , I 'll tell you something else that will surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you saw in here with me as he does of his own brother , and 011ie Belding is as good a friend as I ever had ! " I decided that I was to understand , from this , that the speaker was the equal of the Governor , and had , in a roundabout way , his friendship . I made a suitable noise about it and continued to wonder what Governor Metcalfhad been doing there . I could hear someone singing , kitchenwards , in a voice that was n't bad of its kind  --  the vaudeville kind  --  and wondered about that too . Then my waitress backed into the room , carrying a tray of clean dishes and saying in a reproachful tone to someoneout of sight , " I do n't see how you can be so carefree , Honey , with poor Lauretta hardly cold ! " She let the door swing shut and put on a pleasanter expression for me . " Anything else , sir ? " " No , thank you . Was the woman who died here last night a tourist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if the " poor Lauretta " referred to her . " Oh , no ! She was 011ie Belding 's wife ; we 've known ' em for years . They stay with us a few days every year when the Metcalfs are up here in the summer . He 's awfullygood to 011ie. 011ie shoves him summers . " " I see , " I said , after a pause for reflection , " he 's the Governor 's chauffeur . " Teggart spoke abruptly , " No , he is n't any chauffeur ! He 's the Lordamighty 's bodyguard , and he saved his life once , too , I 'd have you to know . He drives him around up here in the summer-time because he wants to , that's30 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEall ! And because Metcalf do n't trust anybody else to . " There was the usual mixture of assumed contempt of any man 's superiority and boasting servility in everything Teggart said . If they ever got that mixture out of their minds , I thought , the proletariat might be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lon ! The Metcalfs are fine people , everybody says so , and you know it . It 's a shame that a man like that has to have a bodyguard at all . He 's so kind and charitable . " " Who the hell wants his charity ! " Lon burst out ferociously . " And if you had a soft berth like his you 'd be willing to be protected . " He turned his back , but continued to grumble under his breath . The subject seemed to have reached a dead end , but Mrs. Teggart gave me then what she obviously thought was the cream of her story , saved for the last . " Well , poor Mrs. Belding ! She 's no more , as they say , and no mistake . They 've cre-ma-ted her ! " " Not already , have they ? " " Wei-1 , maybe not yet , but they 're going to . Mr. Metcalfpersuaded ' em to it , and I ' spose it 's all right for them that can bring themselves to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to think of anyone being  --  just ashes ! " Then she added a quite irrelevant opinion , " I can tell you he 's going to miss ' Cr too , though she was a sickly woman . She looked after ' im like a mother ! " Further talk was , finally , stopped by the reappearance of IIale . " Arc you ready ? " he said briefly to me . I was , and settling the bill went out to our car . A pale and subdued Mrs. I-Iale nodded to me from the back seatTHE " HOME FROM HOME " CAMP 31where she was lying . I forebore to question her ; it was pretty evident that she did n't feel very well . Hale told me , later , that he had found her in hysterics ; she having opened her eyes to find a hearse drawn up outside the door of our cabin . She insisted on leaving at once , as soon as she could get herself in hand . So we left the Home from Home , and all of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the way to the Perkins ' . CHAPTER IIHIGHLAND HOUSEIT was a gloriously clear day and the mountain air was thin and clean after the storm . We probably should have had trouble finding our way if we 'd tried to go on the night before , though after we once got onto the dirt road which wound up through the woods , beside a full , noisy brook , there was nothing to do but follow it until we came to the low sprawling house , whose verandas and terraces overlooked miles of lower country . Mrs. Hale was put- to bed , and I late disappeared to make himself , as he said , decent again . After I 'd produced certain trinkets for the Perkins children , who then lost interest in me , Natica took them away , the dogs settled down for a nap , and I intimated to Bruce that I had a story to tell . With every mile we 'd driven that morning the nightmarish quality of the happenings at the camp had faded , nevertheless I had stuck to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it he was , for the first time since I 'd known hun , unresponsive ; I thought he was bored at the idea of listening , and though I 'd often wondered at his unfailing patience in letting people tell him stories  --  almost everyone wanted to  --  I was a little nettled now . I.le had an insatiable curiosity about anything that was queer or sinister . I 'd known him to rememberfor months a phrase or two , overheard on the32HIGHLAND HOUSE 33street , which struck him as odd ; and often it was this ability to carry in his mind the abnormal and unusual which helped him fit together the pieces of a criminal puzzle , in a way that had given him the reputation of alwayshaving incredible luck . It was n't luck . It was the habit of logical thinking and a remarkable memory  --  especially for the bizarre . He had come up here to the mountains for a much needed rest . He 'd been rather mettlesome and jumpy all summer , and I could n't make Natica see it . He was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me they were leaving for Mount George the next day . " He 's taken to quoting Wordsworth , " she explained . They had planned two weeks of complete seclusion before the Hales and I should join them ; no one else knew where they were going . I had expected to find Bruce feeling like himself again ; he was youngish  --  thirty-five or six  --  and he should have responded more quickly , I thought , to rest . I felt the sudden drop of spirits that comes sometimes with the thought of age  --  of the time when man works no more . Then I caught Perkins eyeing me with the smile which completely put to rout his habitually somber expression , " I dare say I 'll last a few years yet , Chace , " he said , " with proper care , special attention to diet , no alcohol , of course , no smoking , early to bed , never hurry , and all the rest of it . " My grin admitted the truth of his guess , and he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I 've already listened to one today , that 's why I was n't enthusiastic . I may as well confess right now that we were foolish enough to34 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEbreak down  --  scrap our good resolutions  --  we went out to dinner last night and I 'm well paid for it . " " Up here ! I thought there was n't another house for ten miles or more . " " Almost as good as that . No , we went to Patterson . Senator Frary has a big place there , where he spends his summers . He went to the office before he left New York and insisted on having my address . He gave them the impression that something really important had come up , and in case of anything like that , you remember , they were to hand over the address . Then the Frarys came up here a few days ago and asked us to dinner there last night . I was riled at his having got my address that way and should n't have gone , but he was having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and I wondered what Frary would say to him if I refused . I like Governor Metcalf too well to offend him , Natica likes Mrs. Metcalf , and  --  in short  --  we went ! " Perkins closed his lips and I waited . I knew , when he shut his mouth like that , he was in the state in which some men commit murder and others pick a fight with their wives ; Perkins would do neither , but someone was going to be sorry . I le threw away one cigarette and lit another . I checked the inclination to say , " Did n't Doctor Watson say something about chain smoking ? " What I did say was , " Well , I do n't see how all this explains a yarn you heard this morning . " " Naturally not . " Ile drew a long breath and faced me . " Someone , " he said gloomily , " picked out last night to come and steal the Leydecker diamond from Mrs. Frary . " HIGHLAND HOUSE 35 " Good Lord ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never out of their sight except when it was in a bank vault . Where was its own little secret service man ? Did n't it have one ? " " So I supposed . But they had the pleasant idea , last night , of playing they belonged to the proletariat , and Mrs. Frary wore it and tried to act as if it were a trinket she 'd picked up at Woolworth 's . Mrs Metcalf wanted to see it , and Mrs. Frary thought that if she made no fuss about it the rest of us would n't notice it  --  think it was costume jewelry , I suppose ! The woman 's a fool ! " " Mrs. Metcalf being in on the game ? " " Oh , yes , she could gaze her fill , and everybody would be happy . " " A damn funny way to act , " I said , " but quite like them , I should say . Would n't anyone who saw it know it was n't glass ? Anyone , I mean , . that the Frarys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , is the fact that the Senator seems to think I have some responsibility in the affair , having dined there . " I could n't help smiling at the disgust in Perkins ' face , but it was plain he 'd not been able to laugh at the situation . He went on with the story . " He came tearing up here this morning to tell me all about it , and he took a couple of hours in the telling . He got here while we were at breakfast  --  " Just then Natica came out of the house . At the look onher husband 's face she too smiled , though a little ruefully . " He 's been telling you about our visitor , I see . I'm36 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEafraid it was all my fault . I should have held out about last night and refused to go . I could have had a headache or sore throat , or anything else that good wives get when their husbands want an excuse . But I like Mrs. Metcalf so much , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean  --  would wear the famous diamond . I wanted to see it , though I could n't be paid to own it . It would be too much responsibility . " From most women I should have taken this with a grain of salt , but Natica was singularly indifferent to what she called " things , " a characteristic sometimes trying to her friends , for she was always leaving her possessions here , there , and everywhere , and we were always picking them up and restoring them to her . " Oh , my dear , how nice ! " she 'd say , then , " But this is mine , is n't it ? Where did you find it ? How sweet of you , I 'd never have missed it ! " " ' Vhat did you think of the diamond ? " I asked her . " It 's marvelous , of course . I do n't suppose I shall ever see anything like it again . It 's enormous , and the color is incredible  --  pure sunlight ! They think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare try to sell it in America anyhow . " " He  --  the Senator  --  wanted you to hunt for it , I suppose , as though you were running a private inquiry agency ? " I knew what Perkins ' answer would be ; people with more modesty and less claim to friendship than Senator Frary had wanted Bruce to solve their problems for them . The curt decisiveness of his reply showed how he still felt towards Frary . HIGHLAND HOUSE 37 " He did . I told him that it was entirely outside my jurisdiction to begin with , that the local police would be justifiably angry if I interfered with them , that I was taking a much needed vacation and would n't investigate a burglary if it had happened in my own house . " " He hinted then , " Natica put in , " that a burglary in our house  --  since we do n't collect anything  --  would be comparatively unimportant . " It was plain that she had enjoyed the interview . Frary had certainly behaved oddly , I thought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " He attached altogether too much importance to the thing , " Perkins was still grave , ignoring his wife 's amusement . " People have no business buying stuff like that unless they 're ready for the constant menace there is in owning it . " " That 's what I meant when I said I should n't want it , " Natica said . " I 'm afraid I might lose my balance , too , if someone stole it  --  the diamond  --  from me ! " " The Senator ca n't lose what he has n't got , can he ? " " Well , he has his moments , when a thing does n't concernhim , personally . " Even now Bruce would be just . " What he can not understand at all is that the damned diamond would n't get two minutes ' serious thought from the average man , who has too many other things to worry about . And he 'll never believe that I , as an officeholder , am more interested in the average man than in him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for doubting me there , but that 's beside the point anyhow . They 've got a perfectly efficient police department down there38 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEin his town , and the affair is their business . If he is n't satisfied with them he can hire a private detective ; I gave him the name of a good one . " " Did you tell him all of this ? " I wanted to know . " I was forced to , finally . " " What was his reaction ? " " It was then he lost his head . He reminded me that his political influence was considerable and that I might regret  --  " A car had come up the hill , and now rolled by below the screened porch where we sat . Perkins raised his voice a little as it passed . " I told him that if the people who supported me wanted me to spend my leisure chasing stolen bric-a-brac  --  " " Sh-h ! " Natica 's tone was sibilant , urgent . The big car stood just beyond us , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a handsome woman was getting down . Bruce stared at her in horror . She wore a wide-brimmed hat that almost hid her face , but she gave the impression that she was  --  or had been , I corrected myself , after a harder look  --  a beautiful creature . She looked up at us with a smile . " Oh , there you are ! " she called in a sweet , soprano voice , and Bruce 's stealthy retreat was neatly flanked . He went over and opened the porch door . " Mrs. Frary ! " Natica cried with false surprise , and introducedme . I got a smile too , then she turned appealingly to Perkins . " You are n't really going to let us down , are you ? " she asked . " The first thing I said , when we found out what had happened , was Thank God Bruce Perkins is up here . ' HIGHLAND HOUSE 39I felt as though the wretch who 'd taken my diamond were already safely locked up ! And then  --  " Her look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , though her eyes were very sad , and it was not too soft , just a little wistful . But Perkins ' lips were straight . " It 's curious that you should think I am letting you down , " he said , " because that 's exactly what I think you are doing to me . " " Oh , you could n't ! How can you say that ? " " Well , you see I actually did need a rest when I came up here ; I came up here to hide , to tell the truth . Then  --  I was persuaded to go out to dinner when I was only fit , really , for an old men 's home . And in spite of a delightful evening I found myself very tired when we got back here , which was proof that I should n't have gone . This mormng " Oh , I 'm so sorry ! I see how you feel , I do indeed . I 'm afraid , too , that Tom was unfortunate in the way he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clumsy , poor darling ! But you know how little he really means of what he says , when he gets excited . If you 'd only understand  --  it seemed like a special intervention of Providence to have you staying here , and for you to have been right at our house on the very night ! " " I did n't take the necklace , Mrs. Frary , " Perkins said grimly , and ignoring her little sound of protest , added , " and neither did I see anyone who showed any signs of sinister intention . If Providence arranged my being there I 'm afraid They slipped up this time . Now really , Mrs.40 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEFrary , what are your excellent police going to think if I push myself into a case in which I have no concern ? I know what I should think in their shoes !

That 's almost unkind , is n't it ? I tell you I suffer when I think of anyone else handling it . I 'd grown to love it like a child . I know now how mothers feel when their children are kidnaped ! " Perkins made a sudden motion of impatience , but all he said was , " I wonder ! " and when Mrs. Frary looked puzzled he went on , " Do n't , I beg of you , say anything like that to the reporters if they get at you ! It would n't help your husband . " " Oh , I wo n't ; they have been told all that Tom wanted them to know . " " And I should be unkind if I were to let you think for an instant that I could change my mind about this .

" The last clause had an absent sound , Perkins was tired of the subject . But he added after a short silence , " We understood from Senator Frary that the loss was fully covered . " Mrs. Frary 's soft lips drooped . She was not the sort ofHIGHLAND HOUSE 41woman , evidently , whose femininity was ever threatened by a shrewish sharpness . She said sadly , " That does n't help , for I never could replace the diamond . " Then she looked imploringly at Bruce and lowered her voice , " I have something very difficult to say . I know that money  --  that you  --  " He helped her swiftly . " No , I do n't need money . And the Senator explained about the check that might be made out to any charitable organization I chose to name . He was more than generous , but  --  I was not tempted ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see why Bruce should have been tired when we had got there that morning . " Then I may as well give up all hope of ever seeing my lovely diamond again . If you had any feeling for jewels you could n't do this ! There probably is n't another stone like it in the world . " " I admit I do n't share your passion for stones . I 'm sorry . But why do you lose hope so easily ? Why are you so determined the police ca n't do anything ? " " At their best they 're always slow , Tom says . And there have been other cases up here in which they failed completely . Then , right now , they are all excited about the death of that man . By the time they decide who killed him  --  oh , it 's maddening to think my Beautiful may be cut to pieces ! " She made a little gesture towards wringing her hands . " What man are you talking about , Mrs. Frary ? " Perkinsasked with tepid curiosity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't he ? I suppose he did n't think of it . One of our42 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEgardeners was killed last night . Struck by a car , evidently , poor thing ! " " By a hit-and-run driver , you mean ? " Perkins ' face had become more intent . Reckless drivers were a detestationto him . " Yes , I imagine so ; I really do n't know . " " When did it happen ? " " Early this morning , I think they said . " " Near your place ? Or in the town ? " Perkins ' voice was quiet , but it was obvious that he was interested at last , and Mrs. Frary looked at him with genuine surprise . " What difference does it make ? " she asked with more resentment than she 'd shown before . " It 's too bad , of course , and I 'm sorry for his family ; they 'll be taken care of . But these accidents are happening all the time , and it is n't always the driver 's fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Everyone is so concerned about him , and it ca n't help any now to know who killed him ; why should I pretend that it means as much to me as the loss of my diamond ? " " Do n't say that in many places either , " Bruce warned . " I should n't , of course . But we have a dozen or more gardeners out there . These younger ones come and go all the time . Only the oldest ones have been with us more than a few years , or even months . One ca n't be interested in them any more ; they do n't want it , everything is so different . What 's the use of hypocrisy among ourselves ? I did n't even know this man by sight . " Perkins repeated his last question . " I think it was right on our place ; no  --  it was just outHIGHLANDHOUSE 43side the gates . Tom knew how much disturbed I already was and he did n't want to bother me . I know nothing but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Accidentsare very painful to me . " Perkins gazed off towards the blue peaks that were like waves of an aerial sea . He seemed to have forgotten Mrs. Frary . Natica took the lady in hand and Mrs. Frary listened with an abstracted expression . Even yet , I thought , she was not convinced that Perkins would n't pat her on the head and tell her to go home and not worry , that he 'd take care of everything and bring her diamond back to her . She made a final effort . " I 'm very sorry that you feel as you do about this . I think I 've been unfortunate , too , in the way I 've  --  expressedmyself , perhaps ? I should have gone to Governor Metcalf and asked his help , he might have had some idea , or suggestion , as to what we could do , but he is disturbed and busy today . His chauffeur 's wife died last night , and the Metcalfs are quite devoted to the fellow . They 're looking after all the  --  arrangements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't suppose she died at your place , too ? " " Fortunately not ! He drove them there and they stayed , of course . But he , the chauffeur , has a friend near Patterson , I think they said , and he and his wife were staying with this friend . " " The woman died there , while the husband was at your house ? " " No , he 'd got back . He was devoted to her , the Metcalf'ssaid . When they heard , this morning , that she'd44 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEdied , they were so relieved that the chauffeur had been able to get there before it happened . " I became aware that Natica was looking hard at me . " What are you doing ? " she murmured . I glanced down at my hands , Natica was staring at them , and saw I 'd been trying to light a match with a cigarette , which I 'd been drawing across the match-box . Most of the tobacco had run out of the cigarette , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it . " Nothing , nothing at all , " I said quickly . I tossed away the cigarette , lit the match , and sat wondering what to do with it . When I came back to my surroundings Mrs. Frary was saying a reluctant good-by , looking her sweetestreproach at Perkins while she told him to get a good nap and then call her up . After her car had at last dropped from sight down the steep grade I spoke , " That woman  --  the chauffeur 's wife  --  is the one I wanted to tell you about . She died in our camp last night . There was something queer about it , I thought . " " There 's something queer about the whole business , " Bruce agreed . " Let 's have the story . " But it was characteristicof him that , before I began , he wanted a description of the tourist camp and the way it was operated . He 'd never been in one , but when I had answered his questions he probably knew more about them than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've told it here ; at least I got in the essentialpoints . Perkins made no comment when I 'd finished ; we sat in silence for several minutes . Natica watched us apprehensively , I thought . HIGHLAND HOUSE 45Then Perkins asked three questions , and if I had known why he asked them , another life might have been saved . " Why was the dog whimpering ? Did you have any opinion about that  --  at the time ? " " I thought he might have been distressed by the same sounds I 'd heard . He might have been Mrs. Belding 's dog . " " That 's possible , of course . But let 's suppose he was n't . Do you think he was hunting ? Could you hear him digging ? " " No , but he was sniffing , the way a dog does when he 's digging . " " He smelled something , then , I should say . Maybe a rabbit or chipmunk . Your cabin and the Belding 's were about ten feet apart , perhaps less , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?  --  then there was not the distance of an ordinary room between you and Mrs. Belding if her bed was in a position corresponding to yours ? " " No . I was nearer to her than to Mrs. Hale , though she and I were in one cabin , more exactly , under one roof in adjoining rooms . " " I understand that . You are quite sure you have told me everything you heard , Chace ? Or everything you saw ? " " I did n't see anything at all , except the dog . And I 'm sure I could n't have forgotten a sound that I heard in that darkness . " I referred to the dark as though it had been of a special kind , of greater density than usual , as indeed , it had seemed . There was another silence , and at the first words Per-46 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEkins said to break it , Natica got up with a hopeless gesture and started to go away . Bruce went on talking , but he reached for her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have  --  then  --  these facts to begin with : Mrs. Frary 's diamond was stolen at about midnight , the Senator said ; sometime later one of the Frary 's gardeners was killed just outside the Frary place ; at perhaps the same time , around three in the morning , the wife of Governor Metcalf 's chauffeur  --  chauffeur for that evening anyhow , in spite of what the man Teggart said  --  this woman dies in a tourist camp where she and her husband are staying  --  the Metcalfs staying with the Frarys . I 'll grant you , Natica , that there would n't seem to be any very obvious connection between those facts , but my nose is twitching ; I think I smell something , like Chris 's dog at the camp . " Natica laughed , rather forlornly , " I 'm convinced that most dogs never smell anything ; they only pretend they do , to give themselves an excuse to dig ! " Bruce 's laugh was a little forced this time . " You do n't really mind , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course not ! Run along and dig up all the dirt you can ; maybe you will catch something ! " She touched him lightly on the face with a finger as she left us , and the look they exchanged was one of perfect understanding . " You are going to hunt for Mrs. Frary 's diamond , then ? " I inquired after Natica had gone . " Certainly not ! If it turns up I shall deserve no credit . What I want to do is to discover who killed that young gardener , whose name I do n't know yet . " CHAPTER IIIELMER KELLERCORDELL , in charge at the Patterson policeCApTAIN station , had a double right to his title , having served as an officer during the last war . He had known the elderPerkins  --  Bruce 's father  --  well , and knew Bruce as one knows a man whom he has watched grow up . He had been partly responsible for the line of work Bruce had followed , and liked to remind him of that . Needless to say , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to put obstacles in the way of what he wanted , which was to see the body of Frary 's gardener  --  victim of a hit-and-run driver . Perkins gave no explanation , and if the Captain thought it was an odd request he did not say anything to show it , though he looked very thoughtful , very thoughtful indeed . The gardener  --  his name was Elmer Keller , we learned  --  was a pitiful sight , and one that would have stirred the anger of the most disinterested person . His age had been around thirty-five , but his short , slight figure made him seem younger . He might have been good-looking once : the face was so bruised , scratched , and cut that it was hard to tell , and the back of the head was smashed as though it had been hit with a heavy hammer . He had been found by the driver of the two o'clock bus . " That 's queer , is n't it ? " Perkins asked . " How do you4748 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEthink a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automobile accident ? " " Yes , it 's queer all right . It looks as though the car had been carrying something , like a length of iron pipe , that projected beyond the fenders and front bumper , at about the height of his head . " " Yes , that could have done it . It could have been done with a heavy pole , too , could n't it ? Or how about a ladder ? " Cordell looked up sharply ; his face a little redder . " Gad ! I never thought of that ! That 's nearer the truth . " There was a pause . The Captain frowned at Perkins , who was bending over the dead man . Then , " You 've heard of the robbery there last night ? " the older man asked . " Yes , I 've seen Mrs. Frary . " " Did she tell you that the thief used a ladder ? " " No , she was n't concerned with method . " " She would n't be . Well , he did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , were n't you ? We 've got a list here somewhere . Yes ? You know the house then ? You do n't ? I see . Well , there 's a porch or terrace across the big center wing , with pillars running to the roof . At each end of this main wing there 's an extension , a good story high , and the terrace  --  only without any roof over it  --  is carried along in front of the extensions . Get that ? Now in the center of each of these smaller wings , or extensions , there 's a bay window . The burglar evidently got to the top of the left-hand bay window , and fromELMER KELLER 49there to the roof of the wing by means of a small ladder . Mrs. Frary 's room , in the center portion of the house , opens onto this roof . She had some garden chairs and other truck up there ; took sun baths there , they said . There 's a low balustrade around the edge . It was easy enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out through , reach in and help himself to what was on the dressing-table . It was just inside . " " She 'd left the window unlocked , of course ? " " She 'd just come up to bed , and was in her bathroom , getting ready for the night . Her maid was putting away the clothes she 'd worn and had gone into a big closet in the corner of the room . Mrs. Frary said she had the water running and could n't have heard anything . She says the screen would have been locked , and the jewelry put away before she went to bed ; in fact , I think she said the diamond would have been locked up in less than ten minutes . The burglar picked the only five or ten minutes when he could have got away with the thing . " " Then he must have been familiar with the ways of the house , or houses of the same sort . Have they considered the thief may have been someone inside , that the ladder was merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man could have slipped in from the hall as well as the roof . " " I suppose he could 've . The only overnight guests were Governor and Mrs. Metcalf , you know ; you would n't suspect them , would you ? The rest of the people , except you and your wife , were from right in the neighborhood , and all went home . We put the servants through a pretty hot grilling and got nothing at all from them . " 50 DEATH THUMBS A RIDE " What about the night watchman ? Did he see any-thing ? " " Not a thing . The ladder was drawn up to the top of the bay window , you see , and it would n't be noticed from the ground . Well , however it was done , it did n't take long to gather the thing in and scoop up a necklace from anothercase that was lying there open  --  pearls , and from what she said , I judged they were of medium quality . " I was somewhat surprised that Perkins should be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had no interest in the Frary diamond . I concluded he must think Keller had some connection with it . The next question was about the ladder  --  what kind it was . " Why , " the Captain said , " they have a number of them like it out there ; they were made to order for them years ago . It 's a short ladder they use in pruning trees , picking fruit , and such jobs around the place . Frary 's superintendent , a capable young fellow from the State College , said he thought it belonged to them , but would n't swear to it . He 's been there only a few months , says the place was run in rather a loose way before . He 's taking inventory , does n't know exactly what he has got yet . But it had n't occurred to me that it was n't one of theirs until you suggested that the car that hit Keller might have been carrying one . " " Maybe you 're right and it did belong there . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made that hole in a man 's head ? " " Nothing that I can think of . Of course it could have been done with almost any tool that a car carries , butELMER KELLER 5 ' that implies deliberate murder , and we have n't got to that yet . " He was silent , but once or twice his lips parted as though there was something more he wanted to say , and there was a certain expectancy , too , in the look he gave Perkins . " He could have been thrown against something that penetrated the skull , I suppose . " " Yes , that 's how it must have happened . " But the Captainsounded uncertain . Perkins went on with his examination . The clothing was gone , but it had been dirty and ripped open . One shoe had been torn off the foot and was picked up some distance away . The hat was found still further off . " All that makes it look as though he 'd been thrown , " Perkins suggested . " What we thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , as if the car had passed over him . Of course , if he 'd been dragged some distance under the car his head might have come in contact with some part of the chassis and have been smashed , but in that case the injury would have been more general and not look so much like a hole made with a hammer . The body was lying right on the roadway , which does n't look as though he 'd been thrown , does it ? " They bent once more and studied the crater-like depressionin the man 's head . Captain Cordell shook his own head in a puzzled way . Finally Bruce straightened up . " I hope you get the man who did it , " was all he said until we were back in the Captain 's office , and then not52 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEmuch more . " No , thanks , I ca n't stop to smoke now , I have to go out into the country . May I suggest , Captain , that you have someone find out who supplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any extra ones made , over his order ; and if so , were they sold in this neighborhood ? It might be useful to know . I suppose there was nothing found to indicate what you could look for on the murderer 's car ? No paint marks , broken glass , or anything like that ? " " Oh , no , I 'm glad you mentioned that ! It 's another thing that 's bothering me . Does n't seem possible that the car should n't have been damaged , does it ? " " That also would point to something that projected beyond the body of the car . " " Yes . Well , I 'll look up the ladders , Bruce . Come in again and find out what they learn . " " Thanks for letting me interrupt you , and I will come again if I may . " Then at last we did go . At the door Perkins signaled our waiting taxi . He told the driver to take us to Senator Frary 's estate . It was a short distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with bits of farm land , small houses , and one or two fruit stands . Then we came to the narrow road , on our left , leading to the service entranceof the Frary Place . The whole estate , including the Farm , was walled with stone along the main road . A quarter of a mile past the side road was the main entrance , a rather formidable affair of heavy iron gates and stone pillars topped with zoological freaks which reminded me of the brothers Grimm . ELMER KELLER 53 " No lights on the gate , " Perkins murmured . " I did n't notice that the other night , last night  --  was n't it ? " The heavy gates stood open . We got out onto the road before them . Keller 's body had been found about two hundred feet from the gate and on the opposite side of the road , where he should have been walking , facing the oncoming lights , if he 'd been coming from the Edgemont direction. * Perkins and I walked half a mile along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock , the tree boles for knobs , and the ground for stones or anything else that a man might have broken his head against . " It 's useless , of course , " Perkins said , " for unless someonegot out after knocking him off the road and put him back onto it , he was n't thrown by the car . " Our taxi driver , who had left his car and followed along listening to all that we said , put in an opinion . " Mebbe he was n't dead then , an ' they wanted ' im to be found quicker . " " Do you think they would have cared when he was found if they were so callous as to go off and leave him ? " " Well , folks are queer that way . They 'd run , ya ' see , fer fear they 'd get in a jam if the feller died ; or becuz they did n't have any money fer a fine , or damages , but they 'd think they was doin ' somethin ' fer this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road . Mebbe someone around here did it , an ' they knew this Keller , or his fam'ly , an ' that 's why they 'd want ' im found right away . " Perkins said all that might be true , and as if he 'd been reminded of something else , added that he 'd like to look up the Keller family. *See map next page . ELMER KELLER 55So we went back to the taxi and were taken around to the service drive , which led past a group of brick cottages on the edge of the old orchard . In one cottage all of the blinds were down , and a woman with red-rimmed eyes came to the door when Bruce knocked . Yes , she was Mrs. Keller , she said dully . What seemed to be apathy in her manner may have been only the constraintwith which the decent and self-respecting poor cover their grief , as if it were a luxury to which they had no right . But upon Perkins ' suggestion that he might be able to help her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If you 're another of Mr. Frary 's friends , " she said , " I do n't want  --  I ca n't talk to any more of them  --  or any of the police  --  again today . " Her voice broke , but as much from weariness as sorrow , I thought . She put a hand up to hide her trembling mouth . " I have n't come from Mr. Frary , " Perkins told her gently , " and I 'm not representing him in any way . The police only want to help you , Mrs. Keller . " The sagging shoulders went back a little . " Yes ! That 's what they 've told me all day . Then they search the house , and they hint , and ask questions , and nag me , and I know that Elmer  --  " Her voice had risen and become almost indignant , and at the end she lost control of it . She put her hands up over her face and cried helplessly . Then a girl of sixteen or thereabouts came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger and half shame went up to Mrs. Keller and put her arms around the sobbing woman . " Never mind , Mom , " she said , and56 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEthen to us , " What do you have to make her talk for ? They 've been hounding her all day ! As if it was n't enough to have Dad killed ! " The girl 's hard voice sounded defiant , though it was n't entirely steady . Her face was not pretty , except for somewhatremarkable green eyes , but there was a crude and arresting force about it . She had thrown her head up and looked at us rather dramatically , as though she were acting , consciously , the way she thought a girl in her position ought to act . Perkins seemed puzzled . " I 'm sorry , I do n't understand , " he said . " I assure you I came here with no purpose but to be of service to your mother . And if they 've been annoying her , I think I can help her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of jewelry  --  whateverit is  --  that Mrs. Frary 's lost . They do n't care about anything else ! And I do n't care about their damned old  --  " " Lutie ! Please be still ! That wo n't help us . I hope that Mrs. Frary finds her jewelry , I 'm sure . Why should n't I hope so ! And you ought to , too  --  " Mrs. Keller 's voice trailed off exhaustedly , but the girl 's was loud and vigorous . " Well , I do n't ! I do n't care if she never sees the foul thing again . Why should we care ? What do they care about us ! " In spite of the bold words I suspected there was some uncertainty behind them . They were a little forced . Perkins addressed the girl again , instead of her mother . " I wish you could tell me just what has happened . WhyELMER KELLER 57do they think you know anything about Mrs. Frary 's diamond ? Is that what they 've been questioning Mrs. Keller about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she blurted out in a natural and milder tone , " Why , that 's funny ! Do n't you know ? What did you come  --  why  --  it 's the jewel-case  --  the leather box it was in ! They found it in Dad 's pocket ! That 's what they said , anyway . Probably they said something like that  --  made up some excuse  --  to go through every house on the place and tear things to pieces the way they did here ! " " I know Elmer did n't take it ! " Mrs. Keller tried , weakly , to make us believe her . " He was as straight as a die . Just because he was a ' working for Abbott when they had that robbery there , he had to be under a cloud all the rest of his life ! " Perkins ' face had cleared . " Ah , yes , I see . And you were saying ? " " Nothing , only it was no good to hunt here . Elmer never came back at all after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he could of hid anything here even if he 'd a taken it ? " " But they did n't believe you , Mom , when you said he did n't come back ! You ca n't seem to get that into your head . Well ! They did n't find anything for all their trouble ! " There was a sour satisfaction in the girl 's tones . When Perkins glanced at her she put on her curiously self-conscious look of defiance again . His next question was put to Mrs. Keller. 58 DEATH THUMBS A RIDE " Senator Frary knew of your husband 's employment with Mr. Abbott ? " " Yes , I ' spose so . Elmer was n't really fired from Abbott 's ; but a lot of the others were , and Elmer did n't think it was fair , so he quit too . " " That was about two years ago , was n't it ? It begins to come back to me . They never found the stuff that was taken or the man who took it , did they ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago this last April . And I swear that Elmer never knew a thing about it  --  who did it , I mean . " Mrs. Keller 's voice steadied on the last words , and she looked earnestly at Perkins , who asked then , " Have you any idea , Mrs. Keller , as to how the case got into your husband 's pocket ? " " He might of met the fellow who had the jewelry  --  and tried to get it away from him  --  or something like that . If I only knew where Elmer was between half-past seven and the time he was found ! He never stayed out like that before ! I 'm all so mixed up I ca n't think at all ! " " 1 think the real burglar put it in Dad 's pocket to make everybody think he took it ! " Lutie 's opinion was n't even heard by her mother who , in a moment , was telling her own story again ; going over , as she probably would for the rest of her life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clue as to what her husband did , a reason for his being found dead on the road hours after he should have been in bed . She thought he was in bed , she said . They 'd had supper just like always . No , she could n't remember that he acted a bit different than he ever did . After that he lit his pipe and started to walk over by theELMER KELLER 59forcing beds , and to lock up the tool-house , and the pottingsheds , which was part of his job to do every night . Then he might have strolled through the orchards , just because he liked to , he did n't have anything to do with the fruit trees . And it was n't unheard of , though it was unusual , for him to walk down the road a piece to buy a paper at the stand on the edge of Patterson , or to go up to the stables or dairy to chew the rag with some of the men up there . So she did n't worry about him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine . She woke up , sudden , at one o'clock and the first thing she thought was , it was funny she did n't know when Elmer came to bed . Then she discovered that he had n't . She went and woke up Lutie and the two of them put on shoes and coats and walked up to the greenhouses , the potting sheds , and finally over to the stables . Everything was dark and quiet . Perkins , whose eyes had never left hers , interrupted here . " Did you see anything , or hear anything , that struck you as unusual at the time ? " " No , sir , not a thing . Except , of course , that there was lights on at the house . I could just see them through the trees . I only thought , for a second , that it was late for a dinner party to be keeping up . But sometimes some of them play cards half the night . " " You knew , then , about the dinner ? " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they sent down for flowers for the table ; something blue they wanted , but I did n't take much notice . Well , we came back  --  and after a while we went to bed . But I did n't go to sleep again . Around two I heard some cars go6o DEATH THUMBS A RIDEout . I lay and worried , the way a woman will . Finally I began to think that maybe something had happened up at the house , something that could'a taken Elmer up there , and I ' spose I kind'a hoped there had . All I cared about was him . I did n't know what it could be that would call him up there , I just kind'a hoped . Then  --  early this morning  --  theycame and told me . " She stared at Perkins as at a superior being who should , by his simple interest , be able to restore Elmer sound and whole to her . But Perkins ' next question brought back , instead , the tragic reality . He asked her if she knew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had left there when her husband did . Yes , she knew a few of them . One of them went back home  --  England he came from . She 'd known two or three of the women pretty well . There was a Mrs. Bartlett , she took a place in Patterson , and that reminded her that a couple of days ago , when she and Elmer had been to a movie in Patterson , they 'd met a man who 'd been there  --  at the Abbotts '  --  Gage his name was . He 'd got into some other trouble about the time of the robbery . They 'd caught him selling vegetables off the place . He 'd had charge of the kitchen gardens and stuff like that , and they 'd raised a lot . Gage was caught doing quite a little business of his own on the side . " They 'd rather have them rot in the ground , " Lutie interrupted , " than have anybody make a penny out of them ! " " Lutie ! Stealing is stealing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs. Keller added apologetically to us , ELMER KELLER 6 " She 's young , and all mixed up in her mind about lots of things ! " " Naturally . Where is Gage working now ? " " He had n't got a place , he said . He and his wife have been driving around looking for a small truck farm . He says he 's got enough saved to buy one . They 'd been to Florida , but they did n't like it there . He was staying at a tourist camp down near Birmingham . He 's got a trailer . " " What camp is it ? Do you know the name of it ? " " No , sir . But there 's only that one anywhere near here , folks do n't seem to favor them much in this section . " " Probably not . Do you know , Mrs. Keller , what your husband thought of Gage ? Did he think Abbott was justified in discharging him ? " " Well , yes , he did , in a way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that . He was young , and kind'a mixed up  --  like Lutie here . It was hard luck it came out , about his taking vegetables , just at the time of the robbery . Of course he did n't stand a chance then . I guess the police was pretty hard on him . " It was easy to imagine that the Kellers had spent hours of rambling , conjectural talk about Gage and his troubles , about the whole Abbott affair , in fact . Perkins had evidently learned what he wanted to know , or perhaps all he thought he could learn , for he got up to go , thanking Mrs. Keller for seeing him and promising to do anything he could to help her . " Thank you , sir , " she replied , " but there 's only one thing  --  now  --  that anybody can do for us , and that 's to clear him  --  Elmer ; I know he never stole anybody's62 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEjewelry  --  he could n't ! You 'd say the same thing if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center once more and spoke her final lines . She said them to Perkins , with a fierce intensityand a gesture which reminded me of a certain screen favorite rising to a dramatic crisis . " If you can prove that my father did n't have anything to do with their damned jewelry , nor with anything else shady  --  " here she became herself for a moment and said simply , " they could n't believe it in anybody as honest as Dad , " then finished the sentence she 'd begun , " if you can prove that , I 'll worship you all of my life ! " Perkins , looking sheepish , got us outside as quickly as possible after this . " Is n't it rather queer that Captain Cordellshould n't have said anything about the jewel-case having been found on Keller ? " I asked as soon as we were a few feet from the house . " I do n't know that it is . He did n't know that I had any interest in the case , except as a ghoul , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep Keller out of the burglarybecause he thinks Keller did n't have anything to do with it . That would mean that the jewel-case was a plant , and a somewhat clumsy one , I should think . At present I 'm inclined to think Keller was honest , though we ca n't overlook the significance of his having been at the Abbotts ' when the big robbery came off there , and now here at the Frarys ' when they 're robbed . I must get the story of the Abbott business . I wish I knew someone who was there that night . " " What about Governor and Mrs. Metcalf ? Would n't they have been there ? " ELMER KELLER 63 " They 're the only people up here that I can ask about it , at any rate . The Frarys were probably there , but I can hardly ask a favor of the Senator just now ! Let 's run out to the Metcalfs ' . " But before we did that we walked over the probable trail that Keller followed on his last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchards , then graduallycurving towards the hilltop where the house stood . Halfway up , on the right , was a large clearing where the greenhouses and some other buildings were sheltered and partly hidden from the road . Between them and the hilltopwas a stone retaining wall , above which the road we were on swept in a long curve , and still above that the terraced gardens lay before the house . A steep flight of steps led from the clearing to the upper road . We stopped in the clearing . The doors of the various buildings stood open and we had no trouble finding the tool-house . Inside , besides a few large ladders , there were several smaller ones stacked against the back wall . They were all alike and were doubtless the ones we had been told about . While we were looking at them a man came in with a telegraph pruner which he hung in its place . He gave us a curious glance and Perkins said something about our having come to look at the ladders . " It was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he suggested . " Yes , sir , the same kind . But the police took that one away with ' em . " " Did they ? By the way , did you happen to see Elmer Keller at any time last night ? I 'm more interested in him than in the burglar . " 64 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEThe man 's face sobered . " No , sir , I did n't see him any-where . " " Maybe you were n't around last night  --  near these buildings , I mean ? " " No , sir , I was n't . I was up at the stables . " " How early did you get here this morning ? " " I happened to be the first man here this morning . I had some pruning to do and I wanted to get through with it by noon . So I was here early . I got the things I wanted from the tool-house here , and was off before anybody else showed up . " A distinct satisfaction showed in Perkins ' face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Keller had already been here ? Because the door was unlocked ? " " Yes , of course ; but he had n't . He 'd been killed ! " " And when you heard about that you wondered why a careful and conscientious man like Keller had not locked up the buildings here as usual ? " " That 's just what I did ! And I 'll tell you what I decided . I do n't think Keller was on the place at all last night . I think he went off somewheres right after he had his supper . I 've talked to people an ' no one saw him here at all after he went home to eat . " " Do you know of anyone who was in this part of the grounds last evening ? " " No , sir . It 's  --  it was Keller 's job to shut things up here for the night , look to the heat in the buildings an ' all that . " " So it was n't unusual that no one else came here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here after supper . " Perkins seemed satisfied , and we walked back downELMER KELLER 65the road , he calling my attention several times to the beauty of the big , spreading , gnarled old trees , in contrast to the neat ranks of the pruned trees in the new orchards . With some men I might have said about the testimony of the gardener at the tool-house , " That was a stroke of luck . " But I 'd known when that contented expression came to Perkins ' face that he 'd got exactly what he 'd gone up there for , and that if the gardener had not found us , we 'd have hunted until we found him  --  the first man to go to work that morning . CHAPTER IVTHE GOVERNOR AND THE ABBOTT AFFAIRN our way back to Patterson we stopped at the little O newsstand on the outskirts and Perkins asked the man in charge if he had known Elmer Keller , one of the gardeners on the Frary place . He had known him by sight , the man said , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came down for an evening paper ; a nice man he had seemed to be . He had n't seen Keller , though , for several days , and now they said he 'd been killed by an automobile ; it was too bad . " That fits in with the place where Keller was found , does n't it ? " I asked as we got under way again . " He must have been coming from the direction of Edgemont , and not Patterson . " Perkins sounded gloomy . " It would look that way , and it does n't help . When we started out today I thought it was possible that Keller might have run foul of the burglarlast night and have been killed by him ; or that the two might have been working together and have had some little misunderstanding . Not knowing anything about Keller or his habits I could have no idea of what he 'd been doing when he was hit . Now we have a rather definite picture , if we can believe what we 've heard so far about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly , and more or less contentedly following a regular routine. 66THE GOVERNOR AND ABBOTT AFFAIR 67That 's the way I see him . Last night , for the first time , he broke the pattern . He lit his pipe as usual after supper and started out to do his round of chores . He never did them . The break is sharp and complete , you see . Keller disappears for about seven hours . You can say that he ran across someone he had n't expected to see , for if he 'd planned to go out for the evening he 'd certainly have told his wife , but that explanation does n't quite satisfy me . A man who never goes off the place except to walk down for an evening paper , or to take his family to a picture show in Patterson , is n't likely to have any intimate friends outside that same place , is he ? And neither does it seem likely that he should have gone away for that long  --  whatever the reason or however unexpected it was  --  without saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tricked into going by some hocus-pocus , or that he was forced to go . He might have started for Patterson to get his paper , for instance , and have met someone on the way who got him into a car ; he could have been killed , then , with any tool in the car kit , and the accident faked some time later . " " But why ? If that is what happened he must have been killed by the burglar , because of the jewel-case having been found on him , and at the time of the robbery he should have been in bed . What did they have to fear from him ? " " That is the problem , and it looks as if I 'd have to solve it by trial and error . " We were well on our way to the Metcalfs ' by now . They owned one of the old farmsteads north of Birming-68 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEham . It was in the range of mountains  --  more truly hills  --  running through the western end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pioneer settlers . The house was a stone and stucco building , later additions givingit a rambling look , and altogether it was an attractive and substantial place . The Metcalf 's themselves , whom I 'd seen before at the Perkins ' , were not unlike their house . No one who saw them could doubt that they were people of some importance , though their manners were as informalas the architecture of their farmhouse . She was rather roughhewn , with a tall , sturdy figure and a strong face . But voice and bearing bore witness to an inner grace and gentleness . He was the public 's ideal of a portly , white-haired statesman . They were both unusually serious today . The Governortold us he had been arranging for the burial of Lauretta Belding 's ashes . The cremation was , by that time he thought , an accomplished fact . He owned a large lot in the Patterson cemetery , where his ancestors were buried , and where , in time , he expected to join them . Belding , he told us , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was utterly at a loss to know what to do . So his wife 's ashes would be buried on the Metcalf lot , because Belding thought there ought to be a conventionalburial somewhere . He , Metcalf , had suggested cremation , as he always did if it was a death about which he had anything at all to say , as everybody knew , he said . It was a great pity , he added , that they had gone to the Frarys ' last night . Belding was frightfully disturbed because he had not been with his wife all day . " She would eat all sorts of things she was n't supposedTHE GOVERNOR AND ABBOTT AFFAIR 69to , " Mrs. Metcalf explained , " and I imagine he thinks he could have prevented that if he 'd been there . You see , she drove herself to that camp yesterday morning , becauseOliver wanted to drive Webster to Bristol for the unveiling of that monument  --  Webster had to go and say something , it was an ancestor of his , you know  --  " Mrs. Metcalf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and her husband took up the tale . " Nothing under heaven could have prevented the woman 's eating anything that was offered her , or trying any remedy that was suggested to her ! As for 011ie 's leaving her , Green , our regular chauffeur , could just as well have driven us , but I like to have 011ie drive , and , frankly , Green makes me a little nervous on the open road . He 's very good in traffic . " " He 's being kind to me , " Mrs. Metcalf laughed . " I 'm the one , really , who is nervous about Green 's driving . But the point is , as Webster says , the visit to the Frarys ' was a mistake . I did n't really want to go . I knew we 'd be tired  --  after Bristol  --  and they 're apt to play cards all night . You know Webster at a bridge table ! But we arranged to get there early enough to rest before we had to dress for dinner ; and finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others did , we 'd be in bed by midnight . Then she got that diamond from the bank so that I could see it , and it was stolen ! And now we 've heard that one of their gardeners was killed outside their gates last night , though I do n't suppose , " she smiled briefly and without any gaiety , " that our going there can have had anything to do with that ! " " I did n't realize you were at Bristol yesterday , " Bruce70 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEsaid . " You came straight from there to the Frarys ' , then ? " " Yes , we knew there would n't be time to go home , so we had suitcases with us , and we got to the Frarys ' with plenty of time to rest  --  as we 'd planned . " " That 's nice , " Perkins said absently , and did n't notice when we all looked at him with some surprise . He went on . " I 'm sorry to trouble you today , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand and come back anotherday . I 'm trying to find out who killed that gardener you spoke of , and some rather curious things have come to light . I think you can answer a question or two for me . " The Governor 's face became alert . " They said the fellow was killed by a hit-and-run driver , and if that was so I shall be only too glad to do anything I can to help you get him . I have all the rest of the day to talk , if you want that much time ; I 've done all I can for poor Belding today . " " Thank you . You knew Chauncey Abbott pretty well , did n't you ? " " I knew him as well as anybody did , a few years ago . I have n't seen much of him lately . " " Did you ever hear him say why he discharged so many of his servants after that jewel robbery at his house , a couple of years ago ? " Governor Metcalf gave Bruce a sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's was one of them ? I see  --  ah -- yes , I see ! Well  --  we were there that night , as a matter of fact . No use denying that ! The house was full ; everybody in this part of the state was there . It was one of the showy affairs that Chauncey liked to have once in a while . WeTHE GOVERNOR AND ABBOTT AFFAIR 71had come up here to spend the boys ' Easter vacation that year , and we  --  yes , we spent that night at the Abbotts ' . " " I had hoped you 'd know something about it . And the servants  --  do you remember how they figured in it ? " I thought the Governor regretted his hastily offered help . After a noticeable pause he said to his wife , " Just what did happen that night , Edith ? I remember we all insisted on being searched ! " " Trying to make a joke of it , " Mrs. Metcalf reminded him grimly . " Ah , yes ! Just so ! Most of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through our bags and our cars  --  anythingwe had with us . Most disagreeable ! But what could you do ? The stuff was stolen that night , and the police swore no one could have got in from outside . " " They had the most elaborate burglar-alarm system and it never made a peep , " Mrs. Metcalf contributed . " And did n't they prove , ' Webster , that the thing had n't been tampered with ? " " Yes , my dear , they did ! Most disagreeable ! " repeated the Governor . " I will confess , Perkins , that I 've tried hard to forget the whole business . The most unpleasant affair I 've ever had anything to do with ! " " I 'm sorry ! " Perkins apologized , but I knew he was n't . " Never mind , Bruce , " our hostess comforted . " Now that it 's come up again it will be fun to tell you about it . Maybe you can guess who it was ! " " Maybe ! If that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my best for you . Now , can you remember if all the servants slept in the house ? I mean , of course , those who did n't have houses of their own on the place . " 7 2 DEATH THUMBS A RIDE " Yes , all the house staff slept in the house , and all of them , except the housekeeper , in a separate wing that had only one door into the main part of the house . It sounds odd , but that door was locked by the housekeeper at night , after the servants had gone to bed , and unlocked by her in the morning.The entire household was under her charge , and they seemed to have perfect confidence in her ; the Abbotts did , I mean . " " He was rather a suspicious person , then ? " " Almost a pathological condition ! " Governor Metcalf exclaimed disgustedly . " And worse now than ever , I understand . It was a difficult situation ! That 's why we made them go through our things . He 's begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night , did n't you ? " " Collection of what ? " Perkins asked with a smile . " Jewels , of course . You evidently did n't know about them , then . That was why he had the burglar alarm put in , to protect the stones . " " How could he trust his housekeeper ? It would seem that the success of the whole thing depended on the in- tegrity of one frail human , and he does n't emerge as a man who thought too well of his own species . " " I suppose there had to be one person . I 'll tell you something that even Edith has n't known before now . One of the men who was there that night told me , a year later , that he had had a private investigator look up that house- keeper . Anson Mowry , the man , is head of  --  well , you know who he is , Perkins , and he did n't like being searched any better than the rest of us , even though we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was collusion beTHEGOVERNOR AND ABBOTT AFFAIR 73tween the housekeeper and some of the servants , and that they took the jewels . But the investigator reported to Mowry that she was above reproach  --  a regular female Bayard , you know . " " Then when the housekeeper unlocked the service wing in the morning she also disconnected the burglar alarm ? " " That was automatic , I think , and controlled by some sort of clock . I do n't know anything about them . We had one on the city house once , and it gave us more trouble than it was worth . " " But , Webster , that was before they were perfected . I think they are much more efficient now . " " I dare say ! " the Governor returned drily . " But after our experience at the Abbotts ' the bare thought of one of them acts almost like an emetic on me ! " " Let 's say then , " Perkins proposed , " that the alarm was efficient and that the housekeeper was blameless , that puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone in the main body of the house ; in other words , one of the family or one of the guests . " Governor Metcalf said nothing ; his jaw was set stubbornly . But his wife answered . " That 's what the police said , and that 's why they searched all the cars , before anyone left . Because after the alarm was off in the morning , you see , any of us could have got out and hidden something in a car . " She laughed a little , as she would at an obvious absurdity ; but her husband 's face had turned a bit red , and he was n't laughing . Mrs. Metcalf did n't fail to see this . " Of course , " she went on in extenuation , " the Abbotts74 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEtold us repeatedly that it all did n't mean a thing ; that they knew positively that we were as innocent as they themselves , but that the police would n't be satisfied until they had done everything they could . " " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we were sure that Abbott was fairly hounding them  --  every minute  --  to do something ! He had to make a pretense of being decent to us , of course ! Most of us left that next morning , as soon as we could , and I 've understood that after we 'd gone the servants were put through what almost amounted to a third degree . " " After what you 've told me I can believe it , " Perkins said . " Did you yourself ever have any suspicion as to what actually happened that night ? Who the thief was ? " Governor Metcalf 's white mustache twitched as he smiled slightly . " There were one or two people whom I was inclined to suspect more than others , but since that was entirely due to my personal tastes , it could hardly be taken as evidence against those people . " " You were convinced , then , that the thief was one of the guests or one of the Abbotts ? " " He or she , that would be ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , then he cleared his throat , fidgeted a little , and glanced appealingly at his wife , but finally he had to speak . " I 've never admitted it in so many words , and it goes against the grain to do it now , I assure you , but  --  what else could I think ? If we did n't think that , or for that matter if we did , the whole affair was uncanny ! The stuff that was taken , and there was quite a lot of it , disappeared as completely as though one of us had eaten it ! " THE GOVERNOR AND ABBOTT AFFAIR 75 " Was it all Mr. Abbott 's ? " " Oh , no ! Everybody there lost something . As a matter of fact a good deal of Abbott 's collection would n't have been worth much to a thief , unless he 'd found some unique way of disposing of it . But almost every woman there was wearing some good pieces of jewelry , and Mrs. Abbott lost all of hers . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies tied themselves into knots , I 've been told , trying to discover something fraudulent , but they did n't succeed . " " It would have been a pretty difficult matter to avoid payment when the claimants were people like you , Governor , and Senator Frary , and Anson Mowry ! " " We lost comparatively little , " Mrs. Metcalf said . " I do n't often wear jewelry , except my rings , and they were insured ; the Abbotts suffered most , of course . " " I 've always thought , " the Governor contributed , " that he relied too much on that burglar-alarm system . He thought it was proof against any kind of tampering and he 'd grown careless in consequence . They took no other precaution , I mean ; there was only an old-fashioned safe in the house , that any amateur could open without difficulty . " There was a moment 's silence , then Mrs. Metcalf spoke decisively , as though she 'd suddenly made up her mind to say something she had n't intended to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I still think that letter had something to do with it . " The Governor looked distinctly annoyed , and under ordinary circumstances an abrupt change of subject  --  I76 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEthought  --  would have followed . But he knew Perkins too well to think he 'd drop the lead suggested by Mrs. Metcalf'sremark , so with a sort of grim patience the answer came . " Why must you select that particular letter for consideration ? Simply because it preceded a successful burglaryin a house we happened to be staying in ? Really , my dear , I should think you 'd have forgotten that by now ! " " A crank letter ? " Perkins hinted . " I 've had hundreds of them , " he was told , " and as far as I know nothing ever came of them . It 's nonsense to pay any attention to them . Every officeholder who tries to do anything is threatened . " Perkins turned to Mrs. Metcalf . " You 've interested me very much , " he said . " Was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what was in it that you remember it , and attach some importance to it ? " " Both ! " was the prompt reply . " It was from someone who knew we were going to be at the Abbotts ' that night  --  " " If they knew that , why , then , did n't they know we 'd changed our minds and were n't going  --  not until that note came , anyhow ? " " Oh , I 'll grant it was someone who did n't know all about your plans  --  " Perkins seized upon her hesitation to slip in another question . " Could n't you tell me , as well as you can remember , just what the note did say ? " " It was the typical crank letter , threatening me with disgrace , or worse , if I went out of the house that night . It was Abbott they seemed to be hating at the moment , THE GOVERNOR AND ABBOTT AFFAIR 77his spending money in that way just then ; we were at the bottom of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older man . " It was the word disgrace , ' of course , that settled the question of your going . Not that I blame you at all . A clever bit of character readingthough , by the author of the note ! " The Governor 's grin , half-shamed and half defiant , admittedthe truth of this opinion . " Naturally I had to go and see what was up , " he said softly . " The note said , actually , " Mrs. Metcalf corrected her husband , " that you would be disgraced or that something worse would happen to someone dear to you . And curiouslyenough , it was n't until we had got there that it occurredto us that the boys  --  who had just come home from school that day  --  might be in danger . Do you remember , Webster ? " " Certainly I remember ! I sent for Belding and told him to go right home and keep an eye on the boys until we got there . Green came back with the car for us , next day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't expect Belding actually to sit beside the boys while they slept , but I knew they 'd be all right with him on the place , and I was sure I could look after Edith and myself at the Abbotts ' . " " Did Belding think you were in any danger ? " " I do n't think anyone , besides Edith , thought so . 1 think the whole thing was a hoax of some sort . " " Did anyone put into your minds that your children might be in danger ? In other words , indirectly suggest your sending Belding back home ? " After a few seconds ' pause Mrs. Metcalf answered this78 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEquestion . " I should say that someone did , though I ca n't tell you who it was . But  --  do n't you remember , Webster  --  while I was dressing , all at once I said , Do you suppose the boys really are in danger ? ' and I think the idea had been put into my mind , for if it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone . " " They were all talking about that sort of thing when we got to the Abbotts ' house , " the Governor reminded her . " Yes  --  they were ! " The two stared at each other for an instant before she burst out again , " How could we have forgotten that ! That was why the Grants did n't come . " It was Perkins ' turn to exclaim . " The Grants were going  --  that night  --  to the Abbotts ' ? " " Yes , it 's odd , is n't it , that the two people who happened to know you best both got those letters ? " " Great Heavens , Edith ! Do you want Perkins to think we suspect him of sending them to us ? " " Do n't be absurd , Webster , he 'd never think that . I was only wonderingwell , let it go ! What I was going to say is that the Grants had got a letter , too . He was very unpopular at the time , you remember the strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is terribly nervous , insisted on their staying at home . We did n't think at the time  --  Webster and I  --  that there was any connection between the two letters , and we did n't mention the one we 'd had . " " A tempest in a teapot , the whole business , " was GovernorMetcalf 's conclusion . " If the burglary had n't followed , you 'd never have given it another thought . " THE GOVERNOR AND ABBOTT AFFAIR 79But Perkins , I thought , did n't agree . " Was there anything else , " he asked Mrs. Metcalf , " that struck you as the least odd or unusual that night ? " Mrs. Metcalf laughed and glanced apologetically at her husband . " Yes , there was . It was a little bizarre , but it gave me the most eerie feeling when it happened , and it can do no harm to tell you , anyhow . " The Governor watched her apprehensively , as though he wondered what folly she would confess this time . " We had the room we always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been there , have you ? Well , the new wing has a game room and a bar downstairs , which the young Abbotts  --  God save us  --  thought they could n't live without , and two bedrooms and two baths upstairs . They all open into each other  --  " The Governor interrupted . " Make a sketch , Edith , it 's much simpler . " Bruce seconded this , so she made the sketch below : 8o DEATH THUMBS A RIDEPerkins studied it and for some reason seemed to be delighted with it . " A very neat design , and very convenient , " he commented . " Who was in the other bedroom ? " " The Grants would have been if they 'd come . As it happened we were the only people in that wing . We used both baths when we dressed , and I had the inner one . Knowing there was to be no one in the other bedroomI turned the bolt on that door before we went to bed . In the morning , when the hue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had done it . Then  --  my rings were gone ! And I went to that door and it was unlocked . Even now I can feel the cold shiver that ran over me when I discovered it ! " " And I , my dear , still think you did n't actually lock the door , but only thought you did , or dreamed you did ! " Mrs. Metcalf shrugged her broad shoulders in a tolerant gesture , as though she realized the futility of argument . But her face kept the tightened look that had come to it as she spoke . Perkins had got a scent now ; that was plain to me , for his eyes gave him away , but his voice was a little quieter . " You 'd locked the other bedroom door , that is , your own , too , I suppose ? " " She had ! " the Governor answered . " And she had looked under our beds before we got into them , and into our closet if I remember . " " You may laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied imperturbably , " but that letter  --  that particular letter  --  had made me nervous . I was miserable until they telephonedthat Oliver had got home and the children wereTHE GOVERNOR AND ABBOTT AFFAIR 81all right . I could n't have eaten my dinner with any peace if I had n't known ! " She smiled then , as she added , " I began to worry , after that , because Oliver was n't here to look after Webster . " " She really is n't a chronic worrier , you know , though this may sound like it , " Governor Metcalf put in , and indeedit was difficult to imagine anyone with such a wellbalancedmind and body being so upset by so slight a cause . " What happened in the morning ? " Perkins wanted to know , and the Governor seemed , for the first time , amused . " You can imagine what happened , ca n't you , when Abbott discovered that right under the nose of his prize burglar-alarm someone had walked off with a small fortunein loot ? Taken , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to be impregnable ! " " And we forgot , Webster , that that housekeeper declaredshe knew that every servant who was there that night was in the service wing before she locked the door . So it looked , at first , as though someone must have got in from outside . " " Yes , that 's so . She 'd taken care to find out because thehouse was full and there were strangers  --  strange servants  --  there . Yes , indeed I remember ! And I remember thatgathering in the library , too . Abbott had got everybody in the house there as soon as he discovered his own loss . " " Including servants ? " Perkins asked , and gave a snortof derision when he was told the servants were there too . " That explains one thing , at least , " he sighed , and got82 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEup to go . " You 've both been too patient with us , and we wo n't put any further strain on your kindness . But do you think it 's possible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Belding a minute ? I know it 's the worst time I could choose , but I want to ask only a question or two that wo n't in any way remind him of his own trouble . " " Certainly . It may do him good to talk to you about something else . You know where to find him , do n't you ? Ah  --  just a minute , Perkins , did you  --  ah  --  get any light  --  on the Abbott affair ? " " I hope so ; but it 's too soon to know . I 'll tell you as soon as I am sure . " Then Perkins asked a question which was the first sign of his interest in Lauretta Belding 's death , though the tone he used implied only a mild interest . " What sort of a fellow is Belding ? " " One of the best ! I 've come to depend on him more than I should on anyone , I suppose . But he 's absolutely reliable , and willing to do anything . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He acted rather foolishly about her , to tell the truth , " Mrs. Metcalf said . " But he 's one of the best-tempered men I ever knew , anyway . " She hesitated , then said impulsively , " The wife must have been trying . She was quite pretty when she was young , judging from her pictures , but she faded very quickly , and I do n't wonder , the way she ate and lay around all day ; never exercised , you know . " The Governor looked as though he thought some of this unnecessary . He moved restlessly . THE GOVERNOR AND ABBOTT AFFAIR 83 " The point is , " he said with finality , " that Belding 's done enough for me to make it almost obligatory that I help him now , even if I did n't want to , and I do . He really saved my life once , when some idiot threw a bomb into the car . He grabbed it and threw it out ; coolest thing you ever saw . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , that if I want some information , later on , which Belding had , he could be relied on to give it to me straight ? " " Oh , no doubt of it ! Not the slightest . As I said he 'll do anything from acting as bodyguard to servicing the motorcars in an emergency . " " Well , that 's that ! " Perkins said when we were outside . " While I was pretty sure of how Belding stood with the Governor , I wanted to hear it from him . That may be more reliable than the eulogy you got from Teggart . " The Beldings had occupied a few rooms over the offices in which the Governor attended to his business . They were in a small wing , and an outside staircase led up to them . We found 011ie Belding sitting there with a book which , he said , he had been trying to read , and he was relieved to put it down and talk . Here , in this unobservedsolitude , he seemed far less composed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man obviously troubled in spirit and as restless as an idle man usually is . Perkins asked him to tell us what he remembered about the robbery at the Abbotts ' , and his story differed in no detail from the Metcalfs ' . He had n't known much about any of the servants at that time , he said , and he had no idea as to what had become of them. 84 DEATH THUMBS A RIDE " You did n't know , " Perkins asked , " that the man killed at the Frarys ' last night was one of them ? " Belding 's eyes widened abruptly . " Man killed ! Who was that ? " he exclaimed . " He was run down in the road there , " Perkins explained . " Oh , I understand . I did hear Governor Metcalf mentionthe road accident . Yes , he was one of Mr. Abbott 's old servants . That 's rather  --  it 's odd , is n't it ? I always thought he was too hard on them . I suppose they all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know this man  --  Keller , his name was  --  at all ? " Belding hesitated a second before he spoke . " No , Mr. Perkins , I do n't think I could say I knew him . I saw him once or twice at the Abbotts ' , he was one of the gardeners there , I even talked to him once , but I could n't say I knew him . When you first mentioned the Abbotts I 'd forgotten him , so you see I did n't know much about him . " " You have no opinion as to his character , then ? " " No , I have n't . I think I heard the Governor say once that there was a man there who was caught in some sharp dealings , but I do n't know that it was this man . " " I think it was another man , unless there were two . " " I was n't sure there were any . Mr. Abbott was a very suspicious man . It 's not my business to criticize him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there that night it sounded more like a show than what would take place in a gentleman 's house . " THE GOVERNOR AND ABBOTT AFFAIR 85There was a pause and Belding seemed to forget we were there , as he gazed out of the window with lacklustereyes . But he had n't , for all at once he turned to Perkins , looking more like the good-humored , amiable man I 'd first seen . " I 'm afraid I 'm not much help to you , Mr. Perkins . But I 'm going to tell you something I thought at first I would n't . The Governor has never wanted to hear anything about that business at the Abbotts ' , it was very unpleasant to him , and I wish  --  I hope  --  you wo n't say anything more to him , but there is a man here who was at the Abbotts ' that night . He might be able to tell you more . I can get him in just a minute . " Perkins said we 'd wait . When we were alone I asked if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Abbott servant . " Not necessarily . We did n't ask them if they knew where any of them had gone . It 's like the Governor to take one of them on here . " I let it go at that , and in a few minutes an elderly but sturdy man in work clothes came in . " Good-day , sir ; 011ie Belding said you wanted to speak to me , " he greeted Perkins . " Good afternoon . I 'm investigating the death of an old acquaintance of yours , Elmer Keller . I wonder if you 'd answer a few questions about him ; it might help me . " " Yes , sir , if I can . I heard about the accident . It was a shame . Elmer Keller was a fine fellow  --  I never knew a better . I hope you get the man that killed him , there 's too many being done in like that on the roads ! " 86 DEATH THUMBS A RIDE " I hope so , too , though I did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night ; do you know of any friends he had  --  intimate friends  --  whom he might spend an evening with , without saying anything to his wife about where he was going ? " " No , sir , if he had any such pals I do n't know who they were . Elmer kept to himself most of the time , I 'd say . " " There 's a possibility that he was in a car with someone who threw him out , in the midst of a quarrel . " " You do n't say ! That do n't sound like Elmer a'tall . He was a quiet , peaceable man . " " How did he happen to leave the Abbotts ' ? Was he discharged ? " " Well , quite a few was ; I guess Elmer left because he was disgusted . I 'll never believe he had anything to do with that stealing there , no mor'n I did . Abbott was a pigheaded old fool ! That 's what I think , and I do n't care who hears me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them  --  what d'ye call ' em  --  canals ?  --  round his house . " " Moat and drawbridge , " Perkins supplied . " Yes , I 'm inclined to agree with you . Did you see anything , yourself , or hear of anything that would throw any light on the robbery there ? " " N-o-o , 1 did n't . " " But I take it that someone else did ; I thought there must be some reason  --  however thin  --  for a man 's dischargingthat many people . Do you know what it was ? " " Nothing but someone 's saying they saw one of the gardeners up near the house early that morning . " THE GOVERNOR AND ABBOTT AFFAIR 87 " A-h-h ! So that was the way of it ! Was he recog-nized ? " " No , sir ; all they knew was , ' t was a man in coveralls like the gardeners wore . He was at the southwest corner working in the shrubb'ry there . " " How many people saw him ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's the one that told it . " " They could n't learn which gardener it was ? " " No , sir ; they all swore they had n't been near the house , though they had a right to be if they wanted to , without being accused of stealing ! ' Course one of ' em must of been lying , so he fired the lot of ' em . That is , all but Keller , he proved he 'd been somewheres else , but he quit anyway . " " Was the Senator able to give any description of the man ? " " Not much . The man was leaving the shrubb'ry when he saw him , and walking off across the lawn . So he only saw his back . He did n't think much about it , he said , ' till Mr. Abbott called ' em in and talked to ' em all about what had happened . Leastways that 's what I heard . " " Could it have been Keller he saw  --  I mean as to height @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think so . Keller was a little fellow . But anyway , I told you  --  " " Yes , I understand . I only wanted an idea of the size of the man who was seen . " A few minutes later we all went downstairs together and found Belding talking to our driver . Perkins thanked88 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEhim for the use of his room , and added an apology for intruding upon him on this particular day . " D'ye know , " confided the driver , as we went out through the white painted gateway , " today 's the first time I 've ever been on a place like that , and now I 've seen two of ' em . What surprises me is that they keep cows and grow their own veg'tables . You 'd think they could afford to buy all that kind of stuff , would n't you ? " CHAPTER VTHE SENATOR REMEMBERST HE man was more inclined to chat  --  on our way to Patterson  --  than either of his fares , and Perkins did n't discourage him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did , but I did n't try to find out whom he suspectednor what his plan of attack was . I had found that it interfered with what he paid me for doing , which was also , fortunately , the thing that most interested me in my association with him , and that was to study people 's behavior , how they looked , how they acted , and what they said . To do that with honesty and without prejudice requiredthat I remain detached . He spoke to me once when the rumble of a passing truck made his words inaudible to the driver . " I want to go back and rent that cabin you had last night . We 'll stay there tonight . " That gave me something to think about the rest of the way to Patterson . We said good-by to our driver then , who left us rather reluctantly , I thought . Perkins had asked him to drop us in front of a department store . " Go in here , " he said to me , " and buy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow . And oh , yes , a small flashlight . We have n't time to go home for anything . I 'll pick you up here in about an hour . " Pick me up in what , I wondered , and in an hour , punc-89go DEATH THUMBS A RIDEtually , my question was answered . Perkins drove up in a somewhat battered and dirty-looking car . " Wait until you see how she can go , " he said in reply to my dubious look . And I learned later that when the dealer in used cars had wanted to have it cleaned and polished , as was customary before a car went out , Perkinshad insisted that every spot and dent was dear to him and must be left where it was . But they had greased it until there was n't the hint of a squeak in the chassis . The tires were good , and as we proved on our way back to the Home from Home , we could break the speed law by a very satisfactory margin . Before we went back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to see Captain Cordell again . I did n't go in with him but I heard about a part , at least , of the interview while we were taking another look at our car afterwards . The Captain had been expecting Bruce to come back , having been sure there was somethingbehind his interest in Keller 's death . Perkins had been given the necessary authority to investigate that death , and in return he had told the Captain about what he designated , to me , as an idiotic idea that had come to him that morning at Highland House when the Frarys and I had told our stories . " It sounded so mad that I was almost ashamed when I told him , but he thinks there may be something in it , and since I 've stirred up all this fuss I hope he is right . " " Did he find out about those ladders ? " I asked . " Yes ; there were a dozen or more sold in this neighborhood , but they were cash sales , most of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE SENATOR REMEMBERS 91 " Does Captain Cordell think Keller was guilty ? " I felt some desire , myself , to see the man cleared . " Not at all , but Frary  --  " Perkins was staring over my shoulder . He murmured , " Good Lord , Chace , is it devil or angel ! " And at the same moment Senator Frary 's nasal , dominatingvoice came from behind me , " How d ' do , Perkins . Thought you intended to keep clear of anything that smacked of the police while you were up here . Did n't I see you just coming out of the Municipal Building ? " " I 've known Captain Cordell all my life , " Perkins replied with truth . The Senator moved around in front of us , and his enormous expanse of waistcoat struck me with astonishment , as some natural phenomena do , no matter how often they 're seen . He gave Perkins a hard look , with a half grin lifting one corner of his mouth . " Heard you were out at my place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perkins was cheerfully looking over his newly acquired car . " Sorry I missed you ! " " You did n't , Senator Frary . I went out to see Mrs. Keller . " Frary had known that , of course , but he tried to look amazed . " You 're better than I thought you were , " he said , " If you got onto Keller as quick as this . How 'd you do it ? " He had offered us cigars , and was lighting one for himself . " I do n't think I understand you . I 'm not onto ' Keller ; why should I be ? " 92 DEATH THUMBS A RIDE " Did n't your friend Cordell tell you they found the case , the one the Leydecker diamond had been in , on Keller ? " " Oh , that ! Mrs. Keller told me about it . A rather crude attempt to frame the man , I thought . " " What 's your reason for thinking that ? " Perkins countered with another question . " What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Hid it somewhere , of course ! And before he had time to dispose of the case he was hit by that car . " Perkins made no immediate reply to this . He went off on another tack . " I 've been talking to several people about Keller , and I 've got the impression that he was a simple , straightforward man , with a clean record , whose life was centered in his family and his work . That much alone is convincing proof to me that he did n't suddenly stage a daring and successful robbery . " " I 'll tell you what 1 think . You know , do n't you , that Keller was working for Chauncey Abbott when Abbott was robbed a couple of years ago ? Well , Keller had established a record there , too , that was almost too good to be true . Nov I think he was trying to do just what he has done , build up a reputation , it was all part of the scheme . Then he pulls off this affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thinking he was square , and he does the same thing over again as soon as he thinks it 's safe . " " How did he know Mrs. Frary was going to wear the diamond last night ? " Senator Frary frowned . There was a little bluster in his tones when he went on , " Oh , what 's the use of quibTHESENATOR REMEMBERS 93bling about that ? How did anyone know she was going to wear it ? Those things get out . Her maid knew it , and Mrs. Metcalf may have mentioned it before someone . It 's too damned queer , and you know it , to have this man in two places where the same thing happens ! But by Jove , this is not going to be a successful ' robbery ! " " But if what you 've just said is true , then Keller was an extraordinarily clever man . And would such a man have run the risk , for one second , of being caught with that jewel-case in his pocket ? He was found at about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man on the one o'clock bus says there was nothing in the road there when he went by . So we can assume that Keller was killed between one and two-thirty in the morning , on his way home from an unknown place . Do n't you think he would have realized that the police , at that time , knew the diamond had been stolen and that he might walk right into their arms when he set foot onto your premises ? If he had hidden the diamond in some place too small to hold the case too , could n't he easily have buried the case or simply thrown it away ? It seems to me that this clever fellow forgot his cunning when he failed to get rid of such incriminating evidence ! " The Senator 's face had reddened . He did n't like oppositionand never took it well . His voice was raised . " They always slip up somewhere , the best of them . If they did n't you 'd never catch any of them ! " " We 'll hope your burglar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " By the way , when did the police leave your estate last night , Senator Frary ? " 94 DEATH THUMBS A RIDE " At two exactly . I 'm sorry now they did n't make a more thorough search of the grounds ; they went over them , of course , but they were convinced beforehand that they would n't find anything . " " You mean they thought the fellow  --  whoever he was  --  had got away ? " " That 's what they said . But this man Keller might have been with his family then , and have gone off after-wards . " Perkins did n't dispute this . He shifted in another direction . " You were at the Abbotts ' on that night you mentioned , were n't you , Senator Frary ? " The Senator brushed a bit of ash from his coat , and looked thoughtful . " Yes , " he said in a more moderate tone , " we spent the night there . The house was full . " " I 've been told that you saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house early in the morning , and that all the gardeners denied having been there . " " That 's right , I did . " " Did you think at the time that he looked like Keller ? " " No , I did n't , I thought he was too big for Keller , who was a shrimp . But I 'll tell you something I just thought of . It would be easy enough for a little man to make himselflook bigger , would n't it ? Even putting one of those coveralls on over a thick suit would do it . A woman looks bigger if she puts on men 's clothes . So I do n't think size means much in the instance of the man I saw . " " I 'll agree with you that it 's easier for a small man to increase his girth than for a big man to hide it . Had you any idea , then , as to how the thief got into the house ? " THE SENATOR REMEMBERS 95 " Keller could have done it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked up at night ! " " I wo n't deny that that would have been possible , but not quite simple , I should say . The housekeeper they had seems to have been both incorruptible and very efficient . Do n't you think it would have been difficult for a servant who had no business in the house to walk in and hide himself there , where that argus-eyed woman would n't have found him before she locked up for the night ? " " Well , Perkins , I do n't understand this ! " The Senator 's tone had sharpened , his words were like sharp slaps . " You refused , this morning , to make any effort to find the man who robbed my house . Now it looks as though you were determined to clear the person who is suspected , with good reason , of being guilty . " " I 'm sorry , " Bruce said , " but you see I do n't think he is guilty . " " All right ! If you want to kid yourself into swallowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , go ahead . Maybe the police can get somewhere in this case without you ! That would surprise you , would n't it ? " " Not at all ! I told you earlier that they were quite capable of handling the affair . " The two men faced each other a second , Perkins smilingfrostily , Senator Frary making no attempt to soften his belligerent expression , then with brief nods they turned their backs on each other . We got into our car and Perkins took the wheel . He did n't mention the Senatoragain on our way back to the camp . We got into the Home from Home at a time when the96 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEearliest tourist might be stopping for the night . I went in to arrange for the cabin and found our host in better humor than he 'd been the day before . " Found you liked it around here , did you ? " he said with almost a smile . " Well , it 's all right  --  this part of the country  --  for them that 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right almost anywhere for people who had plenty of money . As for me , I did like the country there , and I wanted to see a little more of it . I had persuaded a friend to come back with me . We might climb the mountain , but at any rate  --  I was rather vague here  --  we wanted to look about a little . We would take the cabin for two nights . Perkins made this partly true by looking about the camp pretty thoroughly . There were ten cabins built in a wide semicircle . Between the fifth and sixth was an open lot , and on it was parked the only trailer in the camp . Out in the center , halfway between the main build- i ing and the cabins , was a long shed , in which were the advertised showers , a couple of stationary wash tubs , a row of toilets , and a huge rubbish can which attracted Perkins ' attention for half a minute . I was relieved that he did n't want to delve into it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deposit all refuse in this can . " I suppose it has been emptied this morning , " Bruce said regretfully , and I said heartily that I was positiveabout it . Next , in an apparently aimless wandering outside the cabin , while smoking and waiting for dinner , he had looked over every inch of the sod surrounding our cabin and the next one , in which Lauretta Belding had died . THE SENATOR REMEMBERS 97I sat on the edge of the narrow platform they called a porch , and watched a white-clad nurse leading a frail , middle-aged woman in a slow walk along the further side of the camp , next to the woods . Then Perkins went off down the dirt road , which ran behind the camp and joined the main road half a mile towards Patterson . While he was gone a girl , whose yellow hair suggested she was the one I had heard called " Honey " that morning , came up with bed linen and towels for the cabin , and went in with them . She had the blank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue eyes , and she gave me a smile that might be called the professional smile of a girl whom people had paid to look at . I was curious , for it did n't look like an imitation , it was too confident and its brevity was too well timed . While she was still inside Perkins came back and I gave a backward nod towards the cabin without saying anything . He went in , and I heard him say , " I wonder if we could get dinner now . We 've been outdoors all day , and we 're almost ready to eat each other . " " Yes , I think you can ; Mrs. Teggart said , just as I came out , that she was ready whenever people wanted to come . " The girl 's voice was as assured as her manner , and a good imitation of the best radio-Hollywood vocalization . " Oh , yes , she is the proprietor 's wife ? The young Irish woman ? " He knew , of course , but he sounded as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The girl laughed with an indulgent derision , as though the bare mention of Mrs. Teggart 's name were reason for laughter. 98 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEThen I heard Bruce say , " What a surprise it is , seeing you here ! " My ears felt as if they had suddenly become bigger , in astonishment at what they had heard . " Your 're one up on me , " the girl returned , " for I do n't remember you . " " I saw you on Broadway , or somewhere near there . I have n't forgotten your face , but I 've forgotten the show . " There was a laugh and the voice was more cordial . " The show was Three Mile Limit , sounds funny now , does n't it ? And you have a memory like the elephant , for it was ages ago . " " Really ! If you 're posing as a retired actress , I suggest you use make-up of some sort to subdue your  --  what shall I say , radiant youth is the usual phrase , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Thanks for your encouragement . I am here because I had a breakdown , and this outdoor life , in the mountain air , is what I need , they said . " It sounded like a part she 'd learned . " It seems to be working all right , " Bruce assured her as he opened the door . " I hope you 'll be able to go back next winter . " He came out , followed by another " Thank you ! " He said to me , " Shall we go down and get something to eat ? " and as soon as we were out of earshot added , " If she looks into that suitcase she may wonder why everything we have is new , but we 'll have to chance it . " Involuntarily I glanced back . The girl had come out of the cabin and was staring after us with an intent and sober gaze . It was n't at all the look of a kitten . THE SENATOR REMEMBERS 99 " Where in Heaven 's name did you meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know. " l never met her , and as to who she is I have n't the foggiest ! But I did see her once , on Broadway , and I was perfectly sure she belonged in a show . She was standing talking to a man I could n't see . I do n't mean that he was out of sight , but as I passed them his back was towards me and she faced me . She was saying , And where do you think you can ever find that much money ? ' Then she laughed , and it was not at all a comforting laugh . I did n't look around , or I 'd have seen the man . I wish I had ! It was some time ago , late in winter . Naturally I should not have expected to see her again . It may have been two or three years ago . " It was odd , of course , that the girl had turned up in this place , but I could see no reason for the excitement in Perkins ' eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? " I asked . " It means that my crazy idea may be taking shape . It leads to nothing at this minute , but it may later on . See if you can find out what her name is , and I 'll have someone down in New York trace her . " " Her first name is Honey , I think . " " Good ! That 's all we need . There probably were n't two of that name in the show . " Then we put the girl out of our minds to order the really good , though plain dinner that was presently brought to us . Mrs. Teggart hovered near to watch our enjoyment of food she knew was well cooked . We told her as much , and she thanked us , trying not to smile too elatedly. r oo DEATH THUMBS A RIDE " I do my best , " she said , " but I ca n't equal my motherin-law . She 's the prize cook ! She was teaching me all she knew , until she got sick a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a very apt pupil , and since it was plain we were willing to talk she went on . She 'd have to do most of the cooking from now on , she supposed , because while the older Mrs. Teggart was going to get well , the doctor said , she 'd never be able to work again the way she had . And if anyone thought it was n't killing hard work to run a camp , he did n't know what he was talking about ! That was what broke Mrs. Teggart down , that and the hard times . Worrying was worse than work , really , did n't we think so ? We did ; and we added the usual inanely hopeful opinion that business was beginning to pick up a little , this being in the early years of the depression . Maybe , she said ; they had n't noticed it . Lon  --  that was her husband  --  thought that things were worse , if anything . But of course he 'd been worrying terribly , too , about what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hospitals , doctors , nurses , it was awful what they cost . But as far as she was concerned it was worth it to have Mrs. Teggart getting well , a fine woman like her deserved all they could do for her . " Now it 's funny , is n't it , there was Mrs. Belding , the woman who died here , " this last phrase was an aside to me as one who had been there when it happened , " she never did a hard day 's work in her life , and going off like that quite young ! " Perkins had been listening intently to every word , but by the sudden stillness of his hands , the slight narrowingTHE SENATOR REMEMBERS to iof his eyes , I knew she had reached a topic that he wanted to hear more about . " What was her age ? " I asked , which was as good as anything to keep the subject alive . " We were figuring it out today . She would be about thirty-two . She was a little mite older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes to show that all they say about a woman 's being older spoiling a marriage just is n't so ! He thought the world of her . We 've seen a lot of them and he was always good-natured and easy with her . " I said something about her having been in poor health , remembering what the Metcalfs had said . I did n't know what Perkins wanted , nor how he connected Mrs. Beldingand Elmer Keller , so I was working mole-like , but I suspected he was too . Mrs. Teggart shook her head . " Practi'cly an invalid , " she said , " suffering from gaster-i-tus . And she would eat things she should n't . We always told her it was playing with fire  --  an ' her with gaster-i-tus  --  to nibble along through the day the way she did . But the funny thing is she never ate anything at all yesterday . She had her dinner here , that is , she was ' sposed to , an ' she would n't touch a thing . She an ' 011ie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us had some beer , and crackers and cheese , but she did n't . That was the first thing Lon said , Thank the Lord she did n't get anything to eat here ! ' " The soft Irish voice , with its inimitable pronunciationof Lord , ' stopped as Lon Teggart came through the door . " I 've been talking my head off , " she threw at him witha smile . Then to us , " An ' you 're sure you wo n't have anything more ? All ready for dessert ? Well now , the buckle-102 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEberry pie is special , and of course there 's always apple , an ' ice  --  " " The huckleberry pie , please , " we interrupted with one voice . " And coffee ? " she murmured , and without waiting for an answer hurried into the kitchen . " She 'll talk your heads off if you let her , " Lon Teggarttold us , but without malice . He went behind the counter and began straightening things on it . " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Perkinssaid . " I 'm surprised at that . We 've seen very few tourist camps about here , and this part of the country has always been popular with tourists  --  I should think you 'd have something like a monopoly . " " It 's the same as any other business ; you 've got to have a little capital to make a go of it . My mother started this place about ten years ago , and she made out all right until the depression got going . The land belonged to her , it was my old man 's farm , and she put all she was good for into it ; she worked like a slave . " While Teggart 's tone was not as surly as it had been the day before , it was still not a pleasant one , with its slightly swaggering assumption of knowing all about everything . " As for tourists , " he told us , " there 's plenty of ' em in the big hotels , I guess , but we are n't crowded . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp where folks rent by the week from you , kind of a vacation camp , with sixty or eighty cabins . " " Where would that be ? " Perkins asked . Our pie had come , its flaky crust lying lightly on a thick filling of berries , and cups of clear coffee steaming beside our plates . Teggart leaned on the glass case and became almostTHE SENATOR REMEMBERS 103amiable as he watched us eat . Finally he said , " I 'd get a place up on the Maine coast somewheres , where there 'd be swimming , and maybe fishing , leastways people 'd think there was . Far 's that 's concerned they 'll go and walk up and down for hours looking at the ocean , as though water was the scarcest thing on earth ! " " Have you a place in mind ? " I thought Teggart hesitated before he answered , " Well , there 's a place I 'd like to own , but so 'd I like to own the Ford Motor Company . What chance does a fellow have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I believe a great many people have got hold of enough for some pet scheme , and by perfectly honest means . " " Oh , yeah ? I know that poor-boy-makes-good story from A to Z. We do n't bite on that one any more ! " Perkins tossed his napkin onto the table , and with a questioning glance at me , got up . I had finished the last crumb of my pie , too , and we went over to the counter . As Teggart made change , Bruce said , " I often wonder what you , or the others like you , would do if some one handed you your camp in Maine , all paid for and ready to operate . Would you begin thinking right away how much money you could make if you only owned a nice ocean liner ? " To my surprise Teggart grinned . " I get you ! " he said , then his face turned hard . " All I can say is just give me a chance , one good chance . I ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to know anything we 've been in debt . And by God , you get fed up after a while ! You get to where you 'd  --  " He was stopped by the red-headed boy I 'd seen the104 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEnight before . He burst in , slamming the screen door behind him . " Where 's a good vet ? " he demanded in a high voice . " Tippy 's awful sick ! He 's poisoned , Pop says ; he dug up something back there ! " " Now ! Now ! " Teggart advised . " Keep your shirt on  --  " But Perkins ' face was as white as the boy 's , and he said quickly as he started for the door , forgetting his role of tourist , " We 've had Doctor Fields since we came up . Tell your father he 's just off the square in Patterson . He can ask when he gets into that neighborhood , they all know him . " We followed the boy out , and a minute later saw him drive off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perkins walked over to the cabin where the mother stood watching them out of sight . " Do you know , " he asked her , " if the dog had been digging up by the double cabin they call Riviera ' ? " " Yes , he had . How did you know ? Oh , dear , I do hope he 'll be all right when the doctor treats him ! " Perkins expressed a friendly concern for the little animal , and the woman thanked him absently . She looked worried , and murmured as if she 'd been alone , " Oh , dear , I 'm afraid this will keep us here another day ; what shall I do ? " CHAPTER VIWE MAKE A TEST RUNBEFORE we had got under way towards our own quarters , the girl who 'd been with this family the night before , in the restaurant , rushed out of their cabin , buttoning a white dress as she came . " Mother ! " she called , " What 's the matter ? Was n't that Daddy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , are you ? " " No , I 'm all right . Tippy got hold of something that 's made him sick . He 'll be all right , I guess , when they clean him out . I ca n't imagine what he got into . " As we walked on I could still hear the girl 's voice , " Oh , Mom ! Poor Bud will be heartbroken if anything happens to Tippy ! " Perkins went straight to a hole half under our cabin . " I saw , before we went to dinner , that someone had been digging here , " he said . He knelt and began to scrape out , with his penknife , the dirt that lined the cavity . He worked as thoroughly as a dentist always seems to work , putting what he got into an envelope . " It would have been better , of course , to have done this after dark , but the dog has left me no choice . However , I do n't think we can be seen , can we ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what had happened to Tippy , I think . She was standing , I05z o6 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEstaring when we came up ; but she ca n't see you now . " " And I 've heard it said , " Perkins concluded , as he was refilling the hole , " that dogs have no memory . I wish some people 's were as good ! " Perkins put the envelope into his pocket , and the next thing we did was what most of the tourists in the camp did , we found , if they were staying over another day , and sometimes even if they were n't ; we got into our car and went out . As we drove onto the highway , with Perkinsat the wheel , he said , " Chris , you will think I 'm insanebut I think the solution to our problem -- who killed Elmer Keller and why  --  is right here in this camp , if we can find it . " " Here ! Good  --  well , go on . I 've sworn I wo n't let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me this morning , when it began to look as if there were some peculiar tie-up between this place and Frary 's . Your stopping at the camp seems to have been pure accident , but from there on there 's too much queer coincidence for even the dullest to miss . " We 'd been moving at a good rate towards Patterson , and we stopped now at the first filling station we 'd seen . " I could n't use Teggart 's telephone , and I want to call Dr. Fields , " Bruce said , and left me for a few minutes . He left me for a minute longer while he stopped in Patterson to speak to Captain Cordell , and after that he explained what he meant to do . " I want to time a run from Frary 's place to the camp . The idea I have is going to be worth something or not depending on the time it takes to make that distance . " WE MAKE A TEST RUN 107Then he seemed to forget he 'd ever heard of Elmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the violet dusk , watching the sunset colors fade from the sky above the line of mountains on our left . I was thinking of the contrast between men like Frary and Teggart , and yet , I wondered were they so different ? - Was n't the contrast all on the surface , that surface with which both of them were so much concerned ? Frary spent his days trying to preserve the surface of his life ; he liked the existing order because it had made him and given him what he had ; he was adroit and resourceful in campaigning for that order . Teggart would destroy it because he blamed it for all his misfortunes , and for his own incompetence . He wanted to resurface his life , and he would n't be overnice as to how he procured the means of doing it . The beauty I was watching in the changing sky belonged to anyone who claimed it , but neither Frary nor Teggart cared anything about that , though the Senator might be more apt to mention a sunset . Perkins broke in here with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less alike . " That Mrs. Teggart seems to be a genuine sort of person , does n't she ? She 's made an art of doing what she has to do ; she cooks a plain meal in a way that deserves a medal . Wonder why she ever married a fellow like  --  oh , good Lord ! forget that I said that ! As far as I know , the only marriage that ever failed to raise that question was the owl and the pussy-cat 's . " " Maybe he was n't like that when she married him ; itI o8 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEseems to be easy enough today , to turn a man into a chronic grouser . " We had turned around , now , in front of the Frary estate , and Perkins was intent on the problem in hand . " I 'm afraid we may spend most of the night doing this . Once over the route would n't prove anything at all . Do you mind ? " " As long as I can keep awake , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . " I looked at my watch as we passed Senator Frary 's gates , and again as we passed the entrance to the Home from Home . " Twenty minutes flat , " I announced . " That wo n't do ! It wo n't do at all ! Of course it took us five minutes to get through the center of Patterson , but you 'd have to count on missing some lights , always . " " The traffic is bad at this time of day , " I offered . " Peopleare driving in for theaters and that sort of thing . " " Yes , but it would n't be much better at any time beforemidnight . " Perkins was turning the car . " Let 's try it again , anyhow . All right ? " He shifted gears . " Eight fifty-six , " I said as we passed the camp restaurant . I have never ridden with a man who could snake a car through traffic with both the speed and smoothness of Perkins ' driving . I 'd see a hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would be in it , and through it to a short spurt in the open before we overtook the next mass . We never rubbed fenders or skidded when the lights went red . When they changed we 'd be off before most of the drivers around us had seen the green . He was n't one of those people who always wanted to drive , but when heWE MAKE A TEST RUN 1 09did he gave everything he had to it , and he liked it . I suspected him of making a game of this so-called trial , but it was as much fun as anything we could be doing , I thought . Luck was against us again . We missed one light we could have made when a stout housewife walked across the street in front of us , against a red light , as unconcernedas if she 'd been walking across her own kitchen floor . Bruce said when we went on , " I could have sounded the horn and got by her , and if I 'd been taking someone to a hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illegal errand , and that 's what we 're pretending in this game , I should take no chances of calling attention to myself . That 's why we ca n't steal any bases . " And we did n't . We went through Patterson with perfectdecorum , though we certainly did n't lag . But we missed all the lights around the square , and though Perkinscovered the last stretch of clear concrete at better than seventy , we had added a minute to the twenty at Teggart 's camp . Bruce was really disturbed at this . " A man might get through once by a fluke , but he could n't count on doing it , and if I 'm guessing right , he 'd have to be able to count on it . Shall we try it once more ? " We did . This time we were able to cut the time to eighteen minutes , but still it did n't satisfy Perkins . He drew off the road and stopped the engine , just beyond the camp . " If you 're wondering why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " That idea of mine , about this camp , struck me as perfectly sane and obvious , this morning . Right now it looks rather anemic . I hope I 'm not getting a habit of turning every ordinary happening into a calam-r i o DEATH THUMBS A RIDEity . Take warning in time , Chace , before it strikes roots into you too , and do n't get a taste for melodrama ! " " I was wondering last night if I did n't have the makings of a good yellow journalist in me . " " Maybe it 's too late and we 're both lost ! Maybe , for by Jove , I still think there 's too much coincidence in this affair to be credible . There 've been two big robberies in this neighborhood in two years , by jewel thieves , with similarities in technique that ca n't be ignored . I do n't think , either , that the police will ever find Mrs. Frary 's jewels , any sooner than they did the things from the Abbotts ' . Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crumb of evidence , nor any idea where to look for any . The only man who might have given them any  --  Elmer Keller  --  is dead . The police were convinced that the booty from Abbotts ' was smuggled out of the country in some way , and they were probably right . They put all the machinery  --  customs , coast guard , secret service  --  to work . For months , the Captain said , they watched all the people they 'd ever had any reason to suspect ; they went through their luggage thoroughly when any of them left the country , and you know what thoroughnessmeans with those people . But they never found anything , and I do n't believe they should have this time , either . " Perkins stopped to light a cigarette . I was surprised at what looked like a sudden shift in the talk afterwards . " I knew a man once , an actor , who was playing with a stock company in Canada . It was during prohibition , and that man crossed the border , unmolested , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canadian Club hanging in his wardrobe trunk . " " You are n't suggesting bribery , are you ? I do n't  --  " " He did n't know they were there , " Perkins finished . " he was probably the only man in the company who never took a drink . But some of his fellow members in the company made use of a fact that customs officers soon learn , and that is , you ca n't counterfeit innocence ; I 'll forestall you and say hardly ever . ' They realized this man was telling the truth when he said he had n't any liquor , and they did n't bother him . " " And you think that 's the way the stuff from the Abbotts ' got out of the country ? " " It would be a good way , would n't it ? " He did n't wait for an answer . " Though I do n't think Keller was the thief , it is queer , his turning up in both these cases . But somehow I believe in him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding Mrs. Frary 's diamond for her . And I think it will mean that , for the man who killed Keller will know where the diamond is . He told us that himself when he put the case into Keller 's pocket . That was one mistake he made ; there may be others . " " You 're sure that one man is responsible for both the Abbott and the Frary robberies ? " " Fairly sure . " He turned the ignition key and waitedfor a chance to swing'into the road and turn around . " But I do n't see yet what he could have done with thediamond  --  " We were back in the camp , and Bruce stopped at the restaurant . He looked around at the semicircle of cabins . " There you have me ! I wish I could say , It 's in one ofr r z DEATH THUMBS A RIDEthose cabins , ' and mean it ! Then Captain Cordell could take over my crazy idea , and I could go back and finish my vacation . But there 's too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Frary 's last night , and Lon Teggart 's tourist camp . Come on in and see what Teggart'sclock says , I think my watch is off . " The place was empty except for a boy and girl at a table back in the corner , and Teggart himself . " I want to check my time with your clock , " Perkins told him . " Sure , go ahead . It 's a pretty reliable old timepiece yet . " " Is your camp full tonight ? " Perkins was evidently making talk as he wound his watch . " Not quite . Got four families staying over , counting your cabin , and the people with the trailer are staying . One family came in a few minutes ago , and maybe some more will come later . Sometimes they 're late . We never put our lights out if we 've got a cabin empty . " " That 's not bad , is it , to have five cabins filled and four families staying over ? The others were here for only one night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too ? " " Well , the two singles at the ends were filled with Boy Scouts ; they were on their way to Washington with a scoutmaster . They did n't stay but one night , came in late and went out early . The single on the left of you was taken by a couple of schoolteachers . They ate their supper here and said they were on their way back from Yellowstone . " Teggart was getting a certain pleasure in showing off his good memory , or perhaps it was a sort of vicarious pride in the travels of his lodgers . " There wasWE MAKE A TEST RUN 113another couple in the single out here on the right side of the cabin 011ie Belding had , they were going to Florida . He was a peppy old bird ; doing his own driving , hope he gets there in one piece . " " You are a good landlord , keeping those people in mind as you have , but what about the sixth cabin ? Was that empty last night ? " Teggart looked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couples in that , just tourists . Yeah , the place was full last night , and it 's got to be , every night , this time of year , to make anything . " His tone was sullen now . " There 's a long winter ahead when there 's damn little coming in . " " How do you manage in the winter , do you have centralheat ? " " Hell no ! We 'd be sitting pretty with central heat . We were talking about putting it in . It took about a thousand dollars and we thought we could manage it . My wife had a thousand dollars ; that was her dowry when I married her . " He said " dowry " with an unctuous leer . " She 'd worked all her life , " he explained , " and she 'd managed to save that . I do n't suppose it looks like much to you , but it did to her . She got it by going without anything to eat at noon , by walking instead of riding , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by sitting up half the night making her clothes and punching the clock next morning  --  on time  --  as usual . You ought to hear her tell it , you 'd get a laugh out of it . " In spite of the slur he could n't resist , in his last sentence , Lon Teggart seemed , for the first time , to haveI14 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEforgotten his own grievances ; there was an integrity in what he said that had been lacking before . He smiled unpleasantly as he went on , " Then , my mother got sick . She was in a hospital for about six months . Had to hire a girl here . And we did n't have to worry about that thousand any more . It may last out long enough to pay the bills if I do n't have to keep the nurse I 've got now too long . No , mister , we do n't have central heat . We use oil stoves and people do n't like ' em . They stink . " " They do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I should n't think they would give enough heat for this climate . Why could n't  --  " I did n't listen any more . My attention had wandered to the couple in the corner . I had no business watching them , of course , but they were so completely engrossed by each other that they might have been alone on the moon . With my first glance at them , they had seemed poignantly beautiful , but with my second look I saw that the girl was the same one I 'd seen before in the restaurant and had considered just a pretty , fluffy-haired girl with nice eyes ; while the boy had something in his face I did n't like , a weakness about the mouth and chin . It was only the way they were looking at each other that made them extraordinary . They seemed not only lost in each other , but in a sort of wonder at what they were feeling . Helplessness was the word I thought of , and I thought , too , that that word could have been applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose stories had ever been worth telling . I hoped the future of this pair would not be so ill-starred as most of them had been . They hadWE MAKE A TEST RUN 115some food they were pretending to eat , and they talked a little , very softly , but for the most part they let their eyes talk for them . The girl was dressed in white . A smart little red hat covered a spot of her blond hair , and on the table beside her was a dainty white bag , with a device on the front of it in tiny red stones which matched the hat  --  and her lipstick  --  sufficientlywell so that the effect was entirely charming . I turned around to the two men . Teggart was making a sketch on a piece of paper , and Perkins was watching first him and then the two at the table , who were reflected in the mirror at Teggart 's back . " I still think I 'd put it here , " Bruce said , laying a finger on the paper . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teggart stared at the drawing , absorbed in it , and did n't notice us as we moved away . Perkins went back and tossed something into the little fireplace . As he passed the boy and girl he glanced at them as anyone might , but coming back he looked so hard at the table , from over their shoulders , that he almost stopped . When we were outside he said , " I 'd like to know who that is with the girl in there . Did you see him here last night ? " " No , but I 've an idea I know his name . The girl 's family , you know , were eating here when I came in last night . And the youngster , the red-headed boy who owns the dog , called the girl 's attention to the time , and said he 'd heard her telephoning Jed that they 'd be in bed by then , or something to that effect . She shut him up rather abruptly . I wonder if that was n't Jed with her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it . " After a few seconds he said with more seriousness . " You know the phrase in the grip ' of some emotion or other ? Those two are illustrating that phrase perfectly and literally . Neither of them is thinkingat all , just feeling . It 's rather dangerous ! " " Probably ; but rather wonderful too , is n't it ? " Perkins did n't answer . He was in the grip of somethingtoo , I decided , when he said nothing for several minutes . He was excited , but not entirely pleased by whatever had caused the excitement ; that was my diagnosis . Probably things were n't going as he had wanted them to , or had expected them to . We went into our cabin and Bruce pulled down all the window shades , somewhat to my surprise . We talked until after midnight when the big lamps outside , three on the semicircle of cabins , went out , leaving only the sign down by the road lighted . All the cabins then , I thought , were not taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . He was unnaturally quiet . Earlier in the evening I had shown him where I had slept the night before , and now he opened the door into the room Mrs. Hale had had . He said , " I 'm going out , Chace , I want to try out another idea . Will you go in there where Mrs. Hale slept and stay for ten minutes ? This room we 'll leave dark . When the ten minutes are up turn out the light in there and come back in here . You can feel your way to the bed and lie down right where you slept last night , beside this window . You said Belding 's car stood where ours does now , did n't you ? All right ! Then will you please stay here on the bed , without any lights , until I come back ? Strain your ears for any sound . Try to putWE MAKE A TEST RUN 1 17yourself into the mood of last night , if you can ; that would help . " I did try . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat on Eunice Hale 's bed and went back over all the details of our trip down from Canada . It was very quiet . Once I thought I heard a radio somewhere , one car went over the back road , and two dogs barked during the ten minutes . It seemed more like half an hour . Then I put out the light and groped my way , in complete darkness , to the other bed and lay down . There was no sound now . Last night there had been an occasional moan from Mrs. Hale . I continued to ponder the smallest happenings of the previous night , wondering which of them Bruce considered significant . What had brought him here tonight ? Did he think the same thing would happen again ? When that idea came to me my pulse grew a little stronger . And it was just then that I heard the queer swishing sound I 'd heard before , as though something were being dragged outside my window . My neck felt , suddenly , very bare at the back . And my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to prick them up . There was a very faint click , as though someone had tapped two pieces of metal , like two silver knives together . It was no sharper than that . I had n't heard quite that sound before , it had been slightly different . There were some muffled , indistinguishable noises , and then the movements that I had taken for those of a big dog . Now there should be the whimper of a little dog , but that could n't happen again because Tippy was sick  --  or dead , I wondered which . After a short silence I was startled by an entirely unexpected noise , a man 's voice , pitched so1 18 DEATH THUMBS A RIDElow I could n't make out any words , but it sounded as if something had gone wrong . Was it Perkins ? Had someonefound him there ? Was he in danger ? I wanted to rush out , but he had asked me to stay there and stay there I did , getting more uneasy each second . I did n't look out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direction of the voices . One voice , Perkins ' this time for sure , suddenly came clearly through the window . " Chace ! " it said , " Chace ! " and then , as I started to get to my feet , " Stay there . I do n't need you . I 'll be right in . " Did he want someone else to know I was awake and listening ? A few seconds later our door opened and Perkinsswitched on the light inside . He came over to the bed , his eyes glowing . " Well ! " he said , and waited . I told him all that I 'd heard and just how it had differed from what I 'd heard the night before . " Who else was there ? Whom were you talking to ? " I finished . " I 'll tell you tomorrow , " he promised , and took one quick turn across the room and back . " Now we must get some sleep , we 're going to be busy tomorrow ! " We did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and woke me up . When my eyes were clear enough to see him I thought he could n't have been asleep at all , but he said he had . " I 've got another idea about that test run to Senator Frary 's , it came to me after you were asleep , but I wanted to try it by daylight . It was having that on my mind that woke me up . I 'll get the car started  --  hurry , Chris ! " I was glad , as I dragged on my clothes , that it had not been possible to try this new idea in the dark . WE MAKE A TEST RUN 119We slipped through Patterson easily enough this morning , with no traffic and no lights  --  yet  --  to stop us . When we got to the side road at the first corner of the Frary estate , Perkins turned into it . " Let 's see what 's up here , " he suggested . It was a narrow road , with a graveled surface hard enough for the little traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woodland were on our left ; the house , gardens , orchards , and more woodland on our right . We could see the stables and dairy on the farm side , with a crossroad cutting through to the opposite side in a short , straight line . Our road bore somewhat to the left . We drove slowly , taking all this in . There was enough upwardgrade to make it just possible to run in high gear at our slow speed . At the top , which was the upper corner of Frary 's place , the road ended at a slightly better and wider highway , running at right angles to ours . " Ah ! this is what I wanted ! " Perkins said , and without hesitation turned to the right . A mile more or less brought to sight the great white pile of the Frary house , its back to us . I was surprised to see it so close , but Bruce was n't . " I suspected there must be a road rather close to it back here , " he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner where we turned and see where this road goes in the other direction . " We had to run half a mile further , though , before we found a place wide enough to turn in conveniently , and that was where a lane branched off to the left . A rude gateway arched over it , and at the top , in rustic lettering , we read : BERKSHIRE CAMP FOR BOYS1 20 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEOn the opposite side of the road was one of Frary 's famous orchards . As we drove back we saw that from the Frary house there would be a wide view of all the valley , with the spires of Patterson showing above the trees of the farm . Our road led us to Patterson , but not through the center of town . It met the main highway on the further side of Patterson , about half a mile short of the Home from Home . When we reached the junction Perkins turned around and started back . " Now , " he said , " we 're ready for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run from a point back of Frary 's house , on that upper road , to the entrance of the Home from Home . Though I knew this must be exactly what Bruce , for some reason I did n't understand yet , wanted to happen , he stopped the car after I 'd called the time , and sat there without saying a word . The camp , early as it was , was coming to life . The family in the first cabin were all out , stowing bags and bundles into their car for an early start on their road . Perkins fairly scowled at them as if they , in particular , annoyed him . " That 's just the trouble , " he broke his silence to say as they finally got into the car and drove out past us . " Who are they ? Where are they going ? How would you ever find them again ? They 're as anonymous , as irresponsible , and as free as a flock of birds . What an opportunity , for someone with brains enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone did see it ! " I began to see what he was getting at and what his difficultieswere going to be , and I had them in mind when IWE MAKE A TEST RUN 12 1said , " Captain Cordell would back you up if you had everyone here arrested on a charge of conspiracy to blow up the Panama Canal . " Perkins laughed . " I do n't think I 'll need to go that far , " he said more cheerfully . " But I may have to deviate from the strict truth in some cases . The Captain put me onto a few tricks ! " Then we drove in and stopped at the restaurant for breakfast . For some reason Teggart 's eye was wary this morning . His mouth was shut in a straight line , and he opened it for only the shortest answers to our remarks . But Mrs. Teggart was as chatty as before . When she was alone with us for a minute Bruce asked her how many people would be leaving the camp that day . " Nearly all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three nights at the most , even when they 're sightseeing . The people in the trailer are n't going yet . There was a man took a cabin , night before last , for a week , but he came in this morning and said he had to leave ; his businessplans changed , I guess he told Mr. Teggart . " Then Teggart came back and we asked no more questions . Later , outside the restaurant , Perkins looked around the oval and nodded towards one cabin whose occupants were evidently getting ready to vacate . " There 's the first man we must question , he 'll be lost to us in half an hour . " " How are you going to do it ? " " I have a chance , " Bruce said slowly , " for one whack at each of these families before they get away . I can at least take their license numbers and find out where they're12 2 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEgoing . For anything else I shall have to be guided by what they say and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if shaking off some misgiving . " Come on , " he said briefly , and started towards the cabin on our right , at the Patterson end of camp . As it turned out , Perkins had one talk with each family there , and that was all he needed to fill in the gaps in the theory that had taken vague shape in his mind the morning before . When he was through he knew what had happened at the Abbotts ' two years before , and at the Frarys ' two days before . Moreover , nearly all of us met once more , after we 'd left the Home from Home ; and that meeting I do n't like to remember even now , because all of us did n't come out of it alive . CHAPTER VIIA YOUNG MAN OF CHARACTERA YOUNGISH , very pretty woman sat on the narrow porch of the ninth cabin and watched a man and boy pack a sedan , a car that was in the upper middlepricedclass . There seemed to be a great deal of baggage , but by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baggage . The boy 's efforts were only a-fourth-hearted , I thought . He had one eye on the back door of the main building , where Mrs. Teggart was slowly turning the handle of an ice-cream freezer , and his steps , when he took any , were almost like those of a cripple , they were so halting . " Junior ! " the woman called in honeyed tones as we came up , " Pick up that cushion you dropped . Pick it UP , Junior ! Now put it in the back of the car . " " I do n't want that old pillow ! " the boy said firmly . But his mother was equally , though sweetly , firm , with an amused glance in our direction . " But it does n't have to touch you , dear . You can sit on one end of the seat and put the cushion on the other . " " It 's hot ! It gets in my way ! Every time we go ' round a curve on two wheels that old thing falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corners on two wheels he slid a Puckish eye towards his father ; then he brightened . " Say ! why ca n't I sit in front with Pop and you ride behind ? You can  --  " 123124 DEATH THUMBS A RIDE " We 've gone into all that too many times already , dear  --  " The man 's curt tones cut in . " Junior ! Put the cushion on the back seat ! " He went on wiping an imaginary speck from the shining spotless- ness of his car , and did n't glance at his son , but the latter said , " Yessir ! " and threw the cushion through the win- dow , scrowling at it . I heard him mutter , possibly to him- self , " Danged old pillow ! I 'm not sick , I do n't have to be propped up ! " Perkins was speaking to the man . " I 'm sorry to inter- rupt , but may I ask you a question or two ? About a road accident that happened night before last . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , at having to stop polishing , but that was all . Perkins picked up a folder that the boy had thrown out of the car , and glanced at it absently as the man answered . " Yes ? I did n't see any accident . If it 's a witness you want , why do n't you advertise ? " " We have , of course ; but it 's not exactly that , that I want of you . Your number was taken yesterday as you went through Woodstock , because you turned on a red light . You were n't summoned because of your nonresi- dent license , but if you 're staying here long I suggest you pay more attention to the local laws . You were also driving at excessive speed , " Perkins said this as solemnly as if he 'd never broken a speed law himself . His air of authority had nothing dubious about it , and some people would have been ready to answer questions quite meekly . But this man , as he himself told us , was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority . HeA YOUNG MAN OF CHARACTER 125was huffy at his unaccustomed treatment . He took a card from his pocket and handed it to Bruce . " I 'm in the automobilebusiness , " he said , " as you can see . We make bumpers , and half a dozen other things  --  accessoriesandsell ' em all over the country . I 'm on the road just now , driving all the time , and I do n't get stopped either . You ca n't tell me much about handling a car ! I may have gone a little over your speed law , I do n't know exactly what it is in Woodstock , " there was a large carelessness about this last which made it sound as if he thought speed laws were not for such as he , " but you can be sure I wo n't get into trouble . " " You bet he wo n't , " Junior piped up , " and if he does you ca n't do anything to him , can they  --  " " Keep still , Junior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper from a wallet . He handed it over and Perkins read it , then returned it with a slight bow . " You are prepared for trouble , at any rate , are n't you , in case you do meet it ? That is , in your own state . The opinion of one of your state officials might not count for so much here , of course , so do n't trust too much to it to get you out of difficulties . I 'm sorry I ca n't match your credentials , but I do have enough authority to ask you a few questions . " Then Bruce smiled suddenly , and the air cleared at once . " I 'm not going to say anything about your speed , Mr. Sawyer . We all put on a burst now and then . But I should like you to be quite sure you did n't see anything that could help us find this hit-and-run driver . You were out on the road that night , were n't you ? " This was such an obvious game of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't wonder Mr. Sawyer looked puzzled , though less aggressive . He spoke laconically ; he probably always avoided speech except when it referred to business . " Do n't know what you 're after . I did n't see anything . We got in here just before dinner . Could n't very well eat here , so we went into Patterson for dinner . " " We had a very good dinner here , " Perkins told him . " Did you ? Well , my wife was nervous about it  --  the kid , you know  --  so we did n't try it . " " You probably did n't see that sick woman wandering around , " Mrs. Sawyer said . " Nobody knows what might be the matter with her . I did n't dare risk it . " " I understand . And after your dinner , Mr. Sawyer , did you drive any further ? " " Went to a show . " " We did n't stay there , though , " Junior crowed . " It was a rotten , mushy show . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that lots of times ! It 's fun ! " " That 's enough ! " Sawyer senior said . " We did try another ; saw the feature . Then we did n't feel sleepy , so we cruised along , listening to the radio . Finally got to Lakeside . Had a soda there . Did n't see anything of an accident . " " Aw ! Why did n't you wake me up for a soda ? " " Junior , dear , you needed the sleep . It was quite late then , almost midnight . " " Did you , either going to or coming from Lakeside , see a car carrying a ladder or a length of pipe projecting beyond the bumper ? The man who was killed seems to have been struck by something like that . " A YOUNG MAN OF CHARACTER 127 " Did n't see a thing . What time was this fellow hit ? " " He was found early in the morning , between two and three . " " I was n't on the road anywhere near that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began stroking his car again with a soft cloth , as he asked , " Was n't the man marked in some way that would give you a lead ? I know a fellow who 's a whiz at tracing hit-and-run drivers , from little things you would n't even see . He 's a member of the Accident Investigation Unit of the police force in my town . " " We have n't been able to find a clue , either on the dead man or on the ground where he was found . That 's why we think he was hit by something that projected beyond the car . " " I 'll bet I could find something if I could look ! I read once all about how you do it ! Was he all chopped up  --  " Junior was able to get this much in before his mother 's disgusted , " Jun-ior ! what aw-ful things you think of ! " stopped him . Perkins had waited until the boy was subdued , then he said , " There 's one more question I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have anything to do with the death of the man found in the road . It 's this , when you came in last night , did you see anyone in this camp , or hear anything that attracted your attention ? " For the second time Sawyer put aside his polishing cloth . He looked long and hard at Perkins before he answered . He pushed his hat  --  set at exactly the slightly rakish angle which suited his ugly face  --  pushed it care-128 DEATH THUMBS A RIDElessly and unconsciously to the back of his head . Finally he said in a flat , quiet voice , " What 's all this about , anyway ? I want to know what I 'm getting into . " Perkins ' voice changed too ; it took on an uncompromisingtone with which I was familiar . " I am going to question every person in this camp , becausemost of you are tourists who have been sight-seeing in this neighborhood , and there 's a bare chance that someonemay have seen something that will help me . But I came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed your mind and were leaving here several days earlier than you had intended to . Is there any particular reason for your doing that ? " For a second or two , I think , Sawyer dallied with the idea of a direct refusal to answer . He must have known he should be within his rights as things stood then . But another straight look at Perkins made it discouragingly plain that he was not playing a practical joke , and that he could produce proofs of his right to question if he were challenged . Then Sawyer turned on his wife . He did n't raise his voice , but his eyes were as unpleasant as a shout would have been . " This is what comes of your fool ideas about saving money . I hope you 'll be satisfied , after this , to go to a decent hotel ! " Mrs. Sawyer snapped back , as one should have expecteda woman to do , when she obviously thought too well of herself to be patient under reproof . " If you are n't so hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHARACTER 129are ! Anyway , it was your friends who recommended this place not mine ! " Junior said nothing  --  for once . Sawyer looked at the boy , then turned to Perkins again . " This is the first time we 've ever stayed in a tourist camp , and it will be the last , too . Some folks back home told us this place was clean and respectable . I had about a week 's work in these towns and my wife wanted to come along . ' Well , a week 's bill at any of the hotels around here is pretty steep when you have your family with you . Money is tight , everybody knows that , but my wife  --  well , women worry too much about everything , I guess  --  she got it into her head we were headed for the breadline . She persuaded me to try a cabin camp ; I do n't like it . That 's about the whole story . " " But is it quite the whole story ? " Sawyer hesitated . Mrs. Sawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke up , " You might as well tell them why we do n't like it here . You ca n't get out of it ! " If I do n't , you will , eh ? Trust you to do that ! Junior , you can run over and see that dog you 've been wanting to play with . " Junior did n't act grateful for the permission . " I 'd rather stay here , " he said , his round eyes agog for the story he knew was coming . " We 'll be leaving pretty quick , this is your last chance if you want to see that dog ! " " If I go , can I have a dog ? " Mrs. Sawyer answered . " Why , dear , what would you130 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEdo with a dog at a camp ? If we send you to that nice one we saw , next summer , what would happen to your dog then ? " She glanced at us to see if we appreciated how talented she was in managing the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was deadly serious as he appealed to us , " Do n't they let you have dogs in camps sometimes ? " " What camp ? " Perkins asked judicially . " Berkshire Camp ; it 's swell ! There 's a lake there and a great big orchard , I found it , I got some apples . " Mrs. Sawyer smiled indulgently . " But those apples did n't be-long to your camp , dear . Daddy told you that when he found you . " Junior winked at us , a rapturous wink that distorted half his face . " They 're mighty handy to that camp , just the same . I ate a lot before Daddy found me , must have been a dozen ! " " Jun-ior ! it 's a wonder you are n't sick . " Perkins returned the boy 's grin . " I think I know that orchard , it 's on Senator Frary 's place . " " Gee ! I 'm glad he did n't find me ! " " I do n't think he 'd miss a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little irritation , " Well , I do n't think these men are interested in any more details about your camp , Junior . And do n't let me hear of your ever being caught in that orchard again if we send you to the camp . Now run along , and be back here in ten minutes . " Mrs. Sawyer protested , " We do n't know anything about those people  --  " and Sawyer 's reply was a bark , " Junior , scram ! " A YOUNG MAN OF CHARACTER 131Evidently he could be master in his house . Junior scrammed , and Mrs. Sawyer said nothing . " Now , gentlemen , " Sawyer began to us , " you 've put me in a bad position . I 'd rather leave here and keep my mouth shut . " " I understand your feeling , Mr. Sawyer , but I think that what you can tell me may be of use to me . I 'll tell you this much , first ; this may not be a simple case of accidental death , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost sure that the person whostruck  --  theman found in the road , has been in this camp within twenty-four hours . " I was probably more surprised than Sawyer at the last sentence . Sawyer 's mouth twisted downward in a grimace that might have meant anything . He went on with his explanation as if Bruce had not spoken . " I 'm not in the habit of interfering with other peopledon'thave time . But I came near to it night before last . There was a bunch of folks in the cabin next to us who raised the devil until after two o'clock . We were tired after we got in and we wanted to sleep . These people were having some drinks , I should say , and when they got to singing so loud you could n't help hearing , I thought I 'd have to interfere . But about that time they shut up and we got to sleep . We had n't seen them come in , but  --  we saw them go out , early in the morning . " He gave us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one car . An hour later two girls drove off in another . I decided then I did n't want to keep my wife and child here . I thought I 'd get through at that boy 's camp in time to get out last night , but I could n't . So I went u DEATH THUMBS A RIDEthis morning and told the fellow who runs the place that I was leaving . " " Did you tell him why ? " " No . I mind my own business , generally . " " What do you call minding your own business ? If you do n't like that sort of thing , how  --  in Heaven 's name  --  is it to your advantage to ignore it ? " " I 'm not ignoring it  --  I 'm leaving ! " " What good is that if the proprietor does n't know why ? These places are run for decent people , there 's no question about that . You do n't think the management of a hotel cares a hoot about the public morals , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that 's a profitable clientele . It 's the customer who calls the tune , in morals as in anything else . As a successful business man , you know that better than I do . " Sawyer , I imagined , saw all business in a rosier light than Perkins did , but the last statement , nevertheless , went a long way towards mending the hole in his selfesteem , which had been made there by his having been caught staying in a tourist camp . " It was n't very pleasant , either , having that woman die here . " Mrs. Sawyer added this irrelevant opinion plaintively . She had evidently considered it unbecoming for her to take any part in the talk about their indecorous neighbors . " Well , you can hardly blame the owners of the camp for that , " Sawyer said hastily . " They probably did n't like that , either . But I 've had enough . After this , if we ca n't go to a good hotel , we 'll stay at home . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife , who smiled the Griselda smile of superior women , and her husband added to Bruce , " I tell you what I 'll do ; I 'll stop in and tell the fellow why I decided to go . It may be that he did n't know what those people were , and a word or two will put him wise . " " I 'm very glad you 've made up your mind to do that  --  for several reasons . I 'd like to hear what he says , if you do n't mind . " " I 'll be through here in fifteen or twenty minutes , and I 'll stop on my way out , " Sawyer promised . " Are you going back West by way of Canada ? " Perkinsasked the question as indifferently as he would have said , " How d' you do ? " but the effect it produced was not the same . " Good Lord ! You 're the third or fourth person who 's wanted to know that . That 's one thing  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 'll see you later , then . " As we strolled back through the coarse , uncut grass on the oval , we met Junior . " Hi'ya ! " he called , and flung up a hand . " How 's Tippy ? " I asked , and brought on a deluge of chatter . " Fine ! Say ! did you know that dog was poisoned ? But he 's all right now . Say ! I 'd like to have a dog like that . I do n't see why I ca n't . I 've always got ta ride alone . Tippy would be comp'ny . They 're always saying there would n't be room for a dog in the car , but I notice there 's always room enough for any junk they want to carry ! 134 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEOnce I had to ride clear home from Maine with a busted ole chair jammed in with me . An ' a dog would n't take up any more room than that ole pillow that has to be stuck in with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gosh ! that 'd be fun ! " He had talked so fast that he finally had to pull a long breath , and Perkins said , " Yes , I think that would be very nice for you . I should n't give up all hope yet , if I were you . When is Tippy 's family taking him away ? " " Pretty soon now . They 're going up to Canada an ' we are too . Maybe I 'll see him up there . " " That will be something to look forward to , wo n't it ? " We went on , with Junior 's voice following us until he was in earshot of his parents , when he began shouting a repetition of all he 'd said to us . At the restaurant we bought cigarettes . We lingered over getting lights , and leisurely compared our time with the clock , Teggart watching us with a speculative and inhospitable eye . What had happened , I wondered , to change his attitude so suddenly . He 'd been friendly enough the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were revenue officers and he were operating a still on the premises . Mrs. Teggart , who was arranging field flowers on the tables , seemed unchanged . Then Sawyer came in . Since Teggart might have seen us talking to him , we nodded indifferently . Sawyer 's hat was back at its jaunty tilt , he had on a freshly pressed suit , and he was his own man again . There was a hint of a swagger in his walk as he went up to the counter . " I 've decided to let you know why I changed my mindA YOUNG MAN OF CHARACTER 135about staying here , " he began abruptly . Mrs. Teggart 's movements stopped with his words . " There 's no use beatingabout the bush ; when I 've got a complaint against anybody I let ' em have it straight from the shoulder , and it 's this , there was a bunch in that cabin next to us last night that could n't have got into a decent hotel or touristhouse . They were drinking and one of the girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife and boy hear . No  --  wait a minute now  --  they went off in separate cars , the men in one and the girls in another . I heard their goodbys , that was enough to prove anything I would say about them . " Whatever Teggart 's real reaction was , there was no suggestion  --  on the surface  --  that he might have winked at the charge . He was plainly flustered as he began a haltingdefense , " Why  --  what do you  --  who do you think  --  why , those men were  --  " " Never mind who the men were , if that 's what you 're going to say . I know they do n't amount to much , and if you want to have respectable people staying with you , you 'd better be careful . " By this time Teggart was steadier . I saw him look at his wife , and her white , sick-looking face may have made it easier for him to mutter something like an apology . " Well , I 'm sorry . The men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  who ought to know about things , and I thought they were all right . I only saw the one who paid the bill . I hope it wo n't happen again , that 's all I can say . " 136 DEATH THUMBS A RIDESawyer nodded and strode out . Perkins and I followed , but I shamelessly listened , as I went , to Mrs. Teggart 's dismayed , " Oh , Lon ! what 'll we do ? Now we 've lost another customer , and he 's the kind we want . That 's what your mother  --  " I had to lose the rest . I felt a genuine sympathy for Mrs. Teggart , but Perkins was almost cheerful as we walked away from the restaurant . CHAPTER VIIIRECAPITULATIONAT our cabin a plain-clothes man from the Patterson police force was waiting for us with a note from the Captain . " I 've been here about ten minutes , " he said , " but the Captain said you would n't want me inquiring around for you , so I just waited . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the note , sent one in reply , and then went into his bedroom to re-read his letter , while I sat down in mine to work on my notes . After I 'd been at them awhile I heard some people coming from the back of the cabin on my side . They would have trouble , I thought , squeezing past our car . Their voices became audible and stayed so , they had evidently stopped right outside my window . A girl spoke and a boy answered . " Just think , if our families had n't happened to stay in this camp two years ago , we 'd never have seen each other ! Did you ever think of that ? Is n't it funny ? Do you think you 'd ever have felt the same about someone else , as you do about me ? " " You do n't really think that 's funny , do you ? It 's horrible ! And you know I could n't feel the way I do about you with anyone else ! Sue ! you do love me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 38 DEATH THUMBS A RIDE " Of course I do ! Why do you ask me that so much ? I think we ought to celebrate the day we met here , honestlyI do . Can you remember the date , Jed ? " " Do I remember ! Better than you do , for it 's over two years ago now . Almost two years and a half . And what gets me is that we 've only seen each other six times in all those months . Honest , Sue , I ca n't stand this much longer ! I mean it ! How much do you think we 'll have to have to get married on ? The very least ? " " Well , Mother is always telling me you ought to have at least  --  " " Oh , never mind ! If you 're going to listen to them it 's no good . You know they 'll never let me marry you if they can help it . " My conscience finally triumphed and I scraped my chair noisily over the floor . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on as if the young people did n't realize the noise meant a listener , or did n't care if it did . " Well , never mind , Jed . We do n't have to pay any attention to what they want , we 're old enough to know what we want . " The next words from the boy were in so rough a tone that for an instant I thought some older person had come along . " My God ! How can you be so cool , Sue ? When I think I wo n't see you for another two or three months I 'm just about crazy ! I 'd like to kidnap you and carry you off to some place where we 'd never see anybody again ; just us two ! Think of it ! But you do n't care , that 's the trouble ! You 'll spend next winter running around with some other fellow and having a good time , just like you did last year ! " RECAPITULATION 139The girl 's light , flirtatious little voice was deeper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! how can you say things like that ! I feel as though I could n't stand letting you go , I do n't  --  " The voice broke now , in a sort of whimper , like something in physical pain . " By God ! if you do feel so bad we wo n't wait ! I 've got some money . It 's not much  --  now  --  but it 's my own  --  " " Jed ! there 's Daddy looking for me . No  --  no ! I 've got to go . Listen  --  " They moved away . I sat and thought about what I 'd heard until Perkins came in , then I repeated it to him . He was very thoughtful , too , after he had heard it . " I wonder how old the girl is , " he said . " Oh , seventeen  --  eighteen maybe . Jed must be twenty . " " It looks as if I were going to be fairly industrious  --  not minding my own business , as Mr. Sawyer would put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he went on his face was , for a few seconds , the stagnant , apathetic one of the average man on the street . " I 've been wondering if Sawyer is n't right ; if the supreme good is n't for one to refuse to meddle , even in crime , if only becauseit 's the most difficult thing to do . " " That 's your Puritan ancestry speaking . It tells you the hard thing must be the right thing . " " All right ! But look at it this way , do you believe that human development can be forced ? Assuming , of course , that human development is not a myth . My Puritan ancestryis worsted there , Chace , because I do believe that people must reform themselves ; anything else is a house built on sands . " I40 DEATH THUMBS A RIDE " Wonder what Mr. Sawyer would say about that ? I have an idea he 'd lean rather heavily on the police when it suited him to . Also that he 'd imagine mountainous difficultiesin the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 'd be right there ; but I 'd still say that man must get up the mountain on his own legs , or climb on his hands and knees if he has to , but never be hauled up by a cable railway . They 're dangerous ; did you ever ride on one ? " " Never , have you ? " " Once ; during the ride I meditated on the fallibility of all mechanical contrivances . " " But it took you to the top ? " " It took us to a place they said was the top . But I did n't really believe it . My legs did n't say it was the top ; nor my lungs ; I was n't sweating ; as I should have been , you see . " " Did n't you like the view ? " I asked , laughing a little . " I could n't see the view . I was remembering that what goes up must come down , and I knew I was going to like that even less . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we rode up backwards , like a horse being dragged by his tail . We were advised not to regard the immediate abyss too steadily , but to fix our minds on the distant scene and our trust in the cable . Sounds like a song of some sort , does n't it ? Oh well , we got down that time  --  I felt that it was a miracle ! " " Yes , I can see that it would be hard to believe you were going forward when you knew you were moving backwards . " RECAPITULATION 141We grinned at each other and Bruce said , " We got loose again , did n't we ? What I meant to say was that all we 're doing  --  detecting and punishing crime  --  is rather futile ; does n't improve society , you know . Preventing crime  --  or criminals  --  is another matter . Society is n't interested in doing that  --  not at present . " " They want the law enforced . " " So do I , oftener than it is . But it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll find a remedy ; probably crime itself will cure crime  --  like a strong poison , used medicinally . But if you had a dose or two left over , that you or someone else had been using for medicine , what would you do with it ? You would n't dig a hole and bury it , would you ? " " What in the name of  --  a dose of crime  --  oh , poison ! In a hole ! They found it then ? That 's what your note was . No , you 're right , I would not dig a hole and bury it . I think I should empty it down a drain . " " But if for some reason you could n't get to a drain ? " " Well , I 'd wait until I could . After all , under ordinary circumstances , a short delay should n't matter . " " True . But suppose the circumstances are unusual , that you had no legitimate use for poison , and that you were in danger of being caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should get rid of it as quickly as possible , in whateverway suggested itself at the time . " " Certainly ; and as far away from the place likely to be searched as was convenient , at the time . In that dirt , from the hole under this cabin , they found a partially dissolvedgelatin capsule and some arsenic , and inside Tippy142 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEthere was more arsenic and some chocolate . It 's almost too simple , is n't it ? The two things that Lauretta Belding could n't resist , I should say , from what we 've learned about her , a sweet , and a new remedy of some sort , had to be hidden very quickly . And Lauretta  --  poor soul  --  is now , as her friend Mrs. Teggart had said , just ashes . ' It 's as clear as day that the woman was poisoned , and the chances are it never can be proved . Almost anyone can get hold of arsenic , and any capsule can be emptied and refilled . " " I still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two , " why anyone could n't have kept those things long enough to wash them down the sewer , over in that bathhouse . " " Suppose they knew the bathhouse was occupied , and they did n't dare wait ? That 's one reason  --  there might be others . " Perkins was abrupt . He got up and began wandering around , a sure sign of dissatisfaction . Finally he stopped in front of me , his black brows pulled down and giving him the look of an angry , brooding , gigantic bird . " Can you tell me , " he asked , " how Elmer Keller 's and Mrs. Belding 's deaths are connected , and how they have anything to do with the theft of Mrs. Frary 's diamond ? " " Certainly not ! " I said cheerfully . " Did I ever say they had ? And I do n't know where the diamond is , if you were going to ask me that . " " I do n't give a damn where the diamond is ; but it 's probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours and mine , at this instant ; it may very well be out on Frary 's estate somewhere , that might be a safe place to cache it until the hue and cry dies down . I do n't sup-RECAPITULATION 143pose you can tell me , either , whether Teggart really is under some malign influence or just pretending to be ? " " I should say that passing the buck is one of the commonhabits of Teggart 's type , if that is any help . They ca n't help it , can they ? The words are out before they know their mouths are open . His mother  --  " Perkins did n't often interrupt , but he did now , with impatience , " Naturally ! A doting mother is what producesthe type , usually . " " Why did he stop liking us so suddenly ? " I was still curious about that . " Oh , well , I thought he would . " Bruce turned and dropped onto his knees beside my bed and pulled out the suitcase I had bought . He opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I set a trap for them this morning , before we went out , " he told me , " and they 've sprung it . Not that they learned anything ; but I was afraid they did n't trust us . Sad , is n't it ? " " The girl , the one who calls herself Honey , did up this cabin this morning , I think . I saw her coming from here while we were talking to the Sawyers . " Perkins ' spirits were surprisingly lifted by this news . " You must keep your eye on that girl , Chris . She is a pronounced misfit in this place ; I should like to know where she does fit in ; she does somewhere , you know . She 's not here by accident , nor , I think , for the reason she gave us . " He pushed the case back under the bed , and looked at his watch . " We 've got to be getting on if we catch the rest of these people before noon . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , you seem to know where you 're going ; but me'Before him not the ghost of shores , Before him only shoreless seas . ' that 's the way I feel . Were you serious , Perkins , when you told Sawyer that you thought Keller 's murderer had been in this camp ? Or was that apocryphal ? Along with the yarn about his having turned on a red light in Woodstock , and the rest of it ? " " My dear Chace ! Neither was entirely without foundation . That folder advertised a hotel in Woodstock ; they toss them into cars . The man had come through Woodstock . I looked at him and I heard his child speak to him of his reckless driving . As for the other  --  " Perkins considered , then he recited two verses of the ballad he had been reading to his children when I had found him the morning before .

" It used to make my flesh creep when they read it to me , though I did n't quite know why , and I had a second or two of the same feeling when I saw , here in this camp , RECAPITULATION 145a thing I shall call birk , and that birk grew only in the Frarys ' house , on the night they were robbed . " I tried , and failed , to think of something we 'd seen that could have had a special significance for him . I suppose I looked dubious for he added , " There 's no reason why you should have seen anything , Chris . You were n't at the Frarys ' , you would n't have recognized the  --  thing I saw . " " That 's some small comfort , at least . If you have proof that a person here was at the Senator 's  --  uninvited  --  the other night , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Because I 'm not convinced that he himself brought the  --  ah  --  birk from the Senator 's paradise ; it might have been given to him . And in that case , if I took any notice of it , the real offender would be warned . That must n't happen  --  yet . Now we really must get along . Do n't forget , the thief and murderer must have had opportunity to take the diamond and to dispose of it . Probably someone in urgent need of money , or with a sharp desire for something that requires money to buy  --  or to support . " We walked towards the cabin where the little dog 's owners were staying . Our way led us past the back entrance to the restaurant , and at that point Perkins stopped suddenly and stood staring at the ground near the door . My eyes followed his ; I saw a big rat moving deliberately across the bare ground . " Ugh ! " I exclaimed . " Horrid creatures , are n't they ? " " Obscene beasts ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before going on . He seemed to be doing some hard thinking . CHAPTER IXTHE HOOPER FAMILYTIE family to whom the dog belonged  --  we learned later that their name was Hooper  --  were also packing to leave camp . They were surrounded by baggage which they evidently meant to get into one sedan . It looked impossible , but they seemed cheerfully confident that they could perform a miracle . We had something to talk about here , we asked how Tippy was feeling . The girl Sue sat on the step before the door , knitting on something gay . Her demure , quiet face gave no hint of the passionate protests I had heard from her a short time before . She smiled shyly at me when I put the question about the dog and said , " Oh , Tippy 's fine now . We were so glad you could tell us right where to go so we did n't waste any time . Dr. Fields said he got him just in time . " " I should think you 'd hardly dare let him run loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fear of this sort of thing happening , or of his wandering away . He 's a nice little fellow , I should n't want to lose him . " " Oh , he almost never goes out alone ; there 's a rule in most camps against letting dogs run loose , anyway . Of course , " she smiled again , " we do n't go with him every time , ' specially when it 's dark and no one can see whether he 's alone . He 's very smart , he always comes home . " 146THE HOOPER FAMILY I47 " Yes , he looks intelligent ; has a good memory , prob- ably . " " Oh , my yes ! He never forgets anything  --  unfortu- nately . He 's so persistent , when he wants anything . " " Did Fields tell you what he thought the dog had got hold of ? " Mr. Hooper , who was cleaning out the trunk compart- ment of his car , doubtless with the idea that he could then get more into it , backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . He answered . " I forgot to ask him . I think myself it was spoiled meat . Some that some- body had with them and did n't use . Probably did n't know where the trash barrel was , or were too lazy to hunt for it , so they just dug a little hole and put this meat into it . " Perkins ' amazement was ludicrous . It broke out in one word , " Meat ! " Then , when Hooper looked astonished too , he elucidated , " But meat ! Why in the world should anyone be carrying meat in his luggage ? " Hooper smiled . " I guess you do n't know much about camping , do you ? Lots of them cook their own meals , that 's why they have meat . " " But how do they do it ? There are no stoves of any sort here , are there ? " " They have their stoves with them , alcohol stoves , or electric plates . Of course they are n't supposed to use them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Perkins finally understood , though reluctantly , the knowledge was so distasteful to him . " Ah , yes , I see ; they attach the electric plate to the fixture in their sleeping rooms ! It must be quite  --  cozy ! " ' 48 DEATH THUMBS A RIDE " Most of us who stop at these camps are always hun- gry , and we 're not very fussy about where we eat . " Mrs. Hooper laughed . " I should say you were always hungry ! You eat like farm-hands whenever we stop and even then you are n't satisfied . You have to carry stuff with you  --  no matter what it costs . " She looked pointedly at a basket of rosy , polished apples that stood amongst the other impedimenta on the ground . Hooper drew his head out of the trunk compartment and grinned . " My family think I overreached myself a mite this time , " he said , pointing to the fruit , " and I guess maybe I did . I still think the price was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know 's I can get ' em in here any-He thrust his head back into the cavity , and the boy , who had been playing with the dog , reached towards the basket . " Bud ! " his mother called , " put that apple back . That makes five . If you keep on we wo n't have to worry about carrying them . " Bud laughed . " I wo n't take up any more roorn with ' em inside me , " he pointed out , " and that 'll help you just that much . Please let me have this one , it 's no good any- way , it 's got a hole in it . " Mr. Hooper 's head came out again . " Mind your mother , young man ! " He took the apple in question and tucked it down against the side of the basket . He looked a little flus- tered when his daughter said slyly , " I thought you told us , Daddy , that those apples were guaranteed perfect ! " THE HOOPER FAMILY 149 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be , " his wife agreed , " and I understood that was why they were so high . " She winked at us . " I 'd take that bad one back and make them replace it . " " Now  --  now , Milly ! Do n't start that ! Say , if we carry this overnight bag of Sister 's in the car , I think I can get the apples in back here . " " Oh , no , let 's carry the apples inside ! " Bud cried eagerly . " Yes , and have you munching and making a noise like a horse all the time ! Not while I have to ride beside you ! " his sister retorted indignantly . " Well , all right , Bert , put the bag into the car . " Mrs. Hooper settled the dispute . " It 'll have to go on the seat , there 's no room for anything more on the floor . Fold the small blanket over it and Tippy can lie on that . You chil- dren can squeeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a few hours anyhow . " Perkins , who had been petting the dog , sauntered over to the group . " They are beautiful apples , " he said . " May I ask where you found them ? I should like to buy a basket for my children . " He politely declined to try one on the ground that he never ate them raw , but he thought his children 's appre- ciation would equal Bud 's . If they would be so kind " Sure ! We got them at a farmer 's stand out beyond Patterson . He said they came from a big estate right near there , do n't remember whose . " " Why , Bert , he said it was a senator 's , who raised fruit150 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEfor a hobby , and I still say he makes his hobby pay for itself , all right , because those apples were about a dollar more than they 'd be anywhere else . " " Well , Milly , you ought to be willing to pay something extra for eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something about taking them back , yet , if she had her way . " Thank you , " Perkins said to F-Iooper . " I think I can find the place easily . And if you 'll forgive me for interruptingyou further , I am asking a question or two of all the people here about a road accident night before last . A man was killed and left in the road in front of Senator Frary 's place . " " That 's the man who raises the apples ! " Mrs. Hooper interrupted , and added ambiguously , " That 's too bad ! " But we knew what she meant . Perkins went on . " I am investigating his death , and since the driver left no clues at the scene of the accident , and the usual search has n't turned up a witness , as a last resort we 're questioning all the tourists in the neighborhood , on the chance some of them may have been driving in the vicinity that night . " " Let 's see , " Hooper mused , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we got here , was n't it ? Well , I 'm afraid we ca n't help you . We got in here around four , and we just rested . We had our dinner there at the restaurant , and we were all in bed by nine-thirty  --  we 'd been driving since five that morning . " " That was too early , as you say ; the man was killed around midnight . " THE HOOPER FAMILY 151 " You were out then , Dad , do n't you remember ? " Bud reminded his father eagerly . " Oh , yes  --  you went out to get medicine for me , Bert . " " I did n't go that way , though , I went into Biimingham . Why in the world should I have gone to Patterson ? " Hooper was annoyed . " Well , you would n't , if you knew the country , " Perkinsagreed . " But even though you went to Birmingham you might have noticed what we are looking for  --  a car with a piece of pipe or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front . " " Oh , you think he was hit that way ? I 'm sorry , but I did n't see a thing , that I remember , anyway . " " You were probably in a hurry , and anxious , and would n't have noticed . " " He got excited about nothing , " Mrs. Hooper gave her husband a look of affectionate ridicule . " He 's scared to death when I get these attacks  --  asthma it is  --  and I did n't have one after all the other night . " " Well , you acted like you were going to , and you did n't have your medicine with you . " Hooper 's gruff tone sounded as if he were ashamed of being too apprehensive . " And nobody wants to travel with a sick woman . Perkins smiled . " I understand . There 's one thing more . Did you see anyone else going or coming , as you went out and came in ? " Hooper looked around the camp . His eyes were narrowedand he took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , " he finally said . " When I ran my car out I15 2 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEnoticed that every cabin in the place seemed to be taken . I did n't give it much thought , just happened to see how they fitted in , a car beside each cabin , except for the space where the trailer is . But when I came back , as I drove in I saw a gap back there , and all I thought was I 'd been wrong the first time . But maybe I had n't . " It was a forlorn clue , I thought , but Perkins pursued it . He asked which cabin Hooper had in mind , and the man pointed to the one next to ours , in which Lauretta Beldinghad died . " Do you know the exact times when you went out and came in ? " " Well , I know you began to act funny about a quarter past eleven , did n't you , Milly ? Was n't it then I heard you prowling around ? " " Y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to persuade you I was all right  --  that wasted some time  --  but you went on dressing  --  " Mrs. Hooper 's vague ideas did n't come to anything definite . " Oh , say it was fifteen minutes , more or less , before I got out . But I know it was n't more than a minute or so after twelve when I came back in , for I saw the clock in the drugstore when I left and it said eight minutes to . The store was the first one on the outskirts of Birmingham , and I came right back . Do n't see how I could have been very long . " " I already knew , " Perkins told him , " that Belding left here at midnight to get medicine for his wife . So you were right in thinking that his car was here when youTHE HOOPER FAMILY 153went , and gone when you came back . That all you saw ? " " Yes . Sorry I ca n't help you more . " " Mom ! " Sue Hooper spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belding  --  fed something to Tippy ? She was so queer when she was in here that day ; I 've been wondering about it . " " Oh , no ! She would n't do that , dear . " " Well , I do n't mean on purpose to poison him , but just because she would n't know any better . She might have coaxed him in there , and given him something spoiled . " " No , I do n't think so . " Mrs. Hooper 's tone was absent . " Her death was quite unexpected , was n't it ? " Bruce asked without too much interest . " Well , of course we did n't know her , but I should think it would have been . She was all over the place that afternoon , visiting around . She came here because she was interested in Tippy . She said she loved dogs but that they always died on her . ' She wanted to feed Tippy . We had some candy here and she ate some , and we told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it in spite of all we could say . " " That 's rather odd ; Mrs. Teggart told us she did n't eat anything at all the day she died ; that she was fasting . " Sue 's blue eyes opened wide . " Why  --  e ! She did eat ! Besides the candy in here she ate some ice cream . I saw Mrs. Strong carrying some in there . Do n't you remember , Mom , she said she never could resist sweet things . Mrs. Strong is so good-hearted . Mrs. Belding probably told her , too , that she loved such stuff , and that 's why they took the ice cream to her . " 154 DEATH THUMBS A RIDE " She was an excitable person , " Mrs. Hooper said reminiscently . " Do you mind , Bert , how she acted when she found that scrap of paper ? Her blood pressure must have been clear up . " Mr. Hooper , who had been storing away the luggage with the dexterity of a man long used to making two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusted off his hands and grinned . " Do I ! I thought for a minute she was going to die on us , as she said about the dogs . " " And all over a scrap of paper ? " Perkins encouraged . " I do n't think it amounted to a thing ! The woman was just crazy ! " Sue 's soft voice sounded strained . " I know what that paper said , I saw it ! I was the one who found it , was n't I , Mom ? I read it out aloud and then she grabbed it and the fun started ! It said  --  " " Bud ! Mind your own business ! You 're the most meddlesomeboy I ever saw ! " The girl was close to tears now , and her father intervened mildly . " Careful now , son ; you do n't want to make trouble . " But Bud had only raised his voice above the others andfinished his sentence without a pause , " Feemy 's in a jam ! " I knew Perkins had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The whole thing , I suspect , was simply the excuse for a flare-up of an excitable temper , " he said . He smiled at Bud . " Did she exercise it on you ? " Bud gave his sister a look which meant he was gettingeven with her for her anger at him the instant before . " Not me ! It was Jed Strong ; he was here as usual . " Hooper spoke again . " That was a funny one , wasn'tTHE HOOPER FAMILY 15 5it , the way she flew at Jed ? As though he knew anything about it ! " Perkins sounded shocked . " You do n't mean she used physical violence , do you ? " " Oh , no , she did n't bite and scratch . She only threatened to let the police see the note . She said she guessed now he 'd wish he 'd treated her with more respect ; probably the young cub had been impudent to her that afternoon . " " She acted just like a child who is proud of knowing something he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sue looked helpless reproach at her parents , then her father added a final opinion which was too much for her to bear . " I guess , come to think of it , it was Jed who dropped the paper , was n't it ? " " What makes you think Jed dropped it ? I thought it was you ! " Her face was white and almost ugly . " Sue ! " Mrs. Hooper cried with scandalized indignation . " How dare you speak like that to your father ? You should be ashamed ! " " Should I ? " The girl 's bewilderment and pain was genuine , I was sure . Her face worked , but she did n't , as I thought she would , start to cry . She picked up her knitting again , and kept her eyes upon it . Her mother 's expression was puzzled and distressed . For an instant I think both Perkins and I wished heartily that we had n't interfered in the affairs of Lauretta Belding and Elmer Keller . Hooper was ready to close the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife , wisely ignoring his daughter 's flare-up . " You 're sure you 've got everything from inside ? We do n't want to have to come back again . " " Yes , I looked the last thing before I came out . " She tried too , now , to overlook the unpleasant fracas by changing the subject . " Do n't forget that if Tippy 's being sick had n't kept us here another night , we 'd never have decided to look for your great-grandfather 's grave . " I tried to help her . " Did some of your ancestors live up here , Mr. Hooper ? I have a great-grandfather buried in the Patterson cemetery , too . Perhaps I should pay him a visit while I 'm here . " Hooper opened his mouth to say something , glanced almost apprehensively at his daughter , and shut it again . It was , doubtless , another idea connected with the Beldingwoman that had occurred to him . Suddenly I wondered if he would see Lauretta 's ashes buried if he stopped at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess we 're ready . " He walked around the car , looking at it and at the ground to be sure he 'd not left anything out . And I saw Jed Strong fairly running across the camp from his father 's cabin . He hardly glanced at the rest of us but went straight to Sue . When she saw him all the strain went out of her face , leaving it soft and flushed , and her whole figure seemed to relax . I heard him say as they walked past me towards the next cabin , " I could n't get away any sooner . The old man  --  " " Sue , " called Mrs. Hooper after them , " we 're going , right away now . " THE HOOPER FAMILY 157The rest of them got into the car . " Thank you for letting me bother you when you were so busy , " Perkins said . " I hope you have a delightful trip ! Where did you say you were spending the rest of your vacation ? " " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes ; you 'll find it a charming old town , quite unAmerican . You can cross the border tonight , I suppose . " He was talking with one eye on the young couple in the background , trying to give them an extra minute perhaps . " I do n't know . Depends on how much trouble I have finding the old grave . Now I 've decided to hunt for it I 'll find it . Been wanting to do that for years . " He touched the horn button gently , and his daughter and Jed Strong came slowly back . She got into the car , which was then backed out of its space and swung towards the road . Jed looked wretchedly unhappy . He stared at the ground as though he could n't bear to look at Sue . When she said good-by , softly , he met her eyes and tried to smile , but his face only twisted in a quivering grimace . Then he managed to say , " Good-by , Sue ! Good-by , Mr. Hooper  --  Mrs. Hooper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car out of sight . Then he turned to go , and as he did , stooped and picked up a large screw driver from the ground . " Did Mr. Hooper forget something after all ? " Perkins asked . Jed 's face had the most peculiar expression , as though158 DEATH THUMBS A RIDEsomething he wanted had dropped from the heavens before his feet . All he said was , " I 'll take care of it . " He held it closely , and I thought I understood then . In some way or other this was going to give him a reason for seeing Sue again , soon . Perhaps he was going to try to overtake the Hoopers in order to return the forgotten tool . He did n't say anything more to us , but scuffed his way through the long , dry grass , back towards his father 's cabin . CHAPTER XMR . STRONG AND PARTYWE both watched him go , Perkins with a slight frown on his face , but when he spoke it was not about Jed Strong . " What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person , called Feemy ? And how did Mrs. Beldingknow that they would be interested in that note ? " " She and Jed had evidently met before , " I suggested . " Obviously ! I wonder  --  Chris , should you say that young Jed is a man who would lead the innocent and unwary into the paths of unrighteousness ? " " I do n't know  --  " I hesitated and Perkins went on . " Mrs. Belding thought so . I suspect that was why she did n't like him . She thought he was a bad influence . Oh , well  --  who knows ? We 'd better be getting over to the Strongs ' , we 've just time to chat with them before noon . " As we went I hummed , " Who is Feem-y ? what is she-e ? " and Perkins inter-rupted , " Remind me to put a call through and find out , as soon as I can get to a telephone , will you ? I dare n't use Teggart 's telephone . " The Strong family was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their side of the camp . There were four of them , a daughter who looked a little older than Jed
