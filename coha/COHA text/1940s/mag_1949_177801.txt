Since mid-June , the heat-humid , tropical , inescapable-had pressed down on great areas of the U.S. In the region around the Great Lakes , in New England and the middle Atlantic coast , the hottest summer on record was in the making . It had been equally hot or hotter in the South and parts of the Southwest , where such weather is more normal , but not more bearable . Last week , temperatures pushed even higher . <P> The burning days &; nights tried the tempers of millions . In Detroit during the week , 45,000 automobile workers walked off the job because of " heat strikes . " In Philadelphia , gangs of young hoodlums drove the water department crazy by smashing hydrant couplings and thus assuring themselves continuous shower baths . Across the hot belts scores died from heat exhaustion and drowning . <P> The crowded inhabitants of big cities tried to live cannily . They avoided hot subway gratings and steaming manholes as martens avoid traps ; when walking they tried to route themselves past the doors of air-conditioned movies , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a barber 's hot towel , or the simple process of swallowing hot coffee , was enough to make a shirt go limp or a woman 's make-up shine greasily . In the packed and airless slums , tens of thousands slept on rooftops or fire escapes . The heat seemed even more pitiless out across the farm states , where farmers often worked from sunup to sundown , sweating in the fields or jolting behind the oven-like engine of a tractor . <P> At week 's end , miraculously , there was a respite . A cold air mass from Canada moved across the Northeast , cooling off-at least for a few days-both farm houses and city tenements.
