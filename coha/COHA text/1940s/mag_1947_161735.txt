Would it actually be possible for the U.S. , as many Americans believe , to gain Russia 's trust by conciliatory moves ? Recently , as this contention became more and more publicized , it was examined by an American who has concerned himself long and closely with the U.S.S.R. TIME herewith presents his prognosis and prescription : <P> People who think that the golden touch of their particular personality and the warmth of their sympathy would modify , to some important degree , the actions of the Soviet Government , are not only flying in the face of some of the most basic and unshakable of Russian realities . They are insulting the ideological firmness of men who have followed the sternest of doctrines since the days of their youth ; followed it through extreme danger , through extreme hardship , and through the sacrifice of every other value known to human life . These men would not be grateful for the implication that they , the guardians of the Revolution , are a group of neurotic , wistful intellectuals , to be swept off their feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an engaging smile , a few kind words , and some gestures of self-abnegation on the part of the other fellow . <P> Figleaf . It would be a great mistake to underrate the importance of ideology in the official Soviet psychology . Ideology is the only positive feature in a regime which has otherwise brought little but harshness , cruelty and physical misery to the human beings who have fallen within the range of its influence . In the name of ideology , it has committed acts which , deprived of any ideological motive , could be classified only with the most stupendous crimes in the history of mankind . <P> Ideology is the figleaf of Soviet respectability . Tear it away , and the Russian leaders stand exposed as only the last of the long series of cruel and wasteful rulers who have driven a great people from one military ordeal to another throughout the course of centuries in order to assure the security of their own oppressive regimes . No one is more aware of this than the Soviet leaders themselves ; and no one is more conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine of Marxism for the acts they have perpetrated in its name . <P> The realizations and recognitions which we would have the Russians make lie closer to the surface of the Russian mind than we might think . In fact , the more closely they approach the surface , the more violently the Russian tries to inhibit them and to conceal them by vehement protestations in the other direction . It is our business to help him with this problem . <P> In secret , though he would rarely admit it , this is perhaps what he wants from us more than anything else . <P> " Wait a Bit . " In one of Chekhov 's short stories , some city people , whom we may take as symbolic of the Western world , try to make friends with the peasants of a nearby village , only to be repulsed time after time . The last attempt is made by the mother of the family , Elena Ivanovna , who goes to the village with her little girl , and tries to have a heart-to-heart talk with the peasants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells us : <P> " Elena Ivanovna suddenly became timid . She turned pale and shrunk together as though she had been touched with something coarse , and walked away without saying another word . . . .
