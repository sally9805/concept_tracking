The Acropolis was unharmed. * So said delayed dispatches from Athens , after the Greek capital fell bloodlessly to the British last fortnight ( TIME , Oct. 16 ) . <P> * That is , by World War II . In 480 B.C. the Persians partially destroyed the Acropolis ; in 86 B.C. Romans under Sulla plundered it ; in the 17th Century , Acropolis temples were damaged by both Turks and Venetians . In 1801-1816 , Lord Elgin carted off a large part of the Parthenon 's remaining sculptures , sold them to the British Government for London 's British Museum .
