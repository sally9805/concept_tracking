1 INT . STAIRWAY - HIGHCLIFFE ACADEMY - DAY The CAMERA HOLDS ON the stained glass window . Beneath the painted figures is a scroll , and on the scroll , a part of the stained glass window , is an inscription : I RUNNE TO DEATH AND DEATH MEETS ME AS FAST , AND ALL MY PLEASURES ARE LIKE YESTERDAY . John Donne , Holy Sonnets VI . As the CAMERA CONTINUES TO HOLD , the jumbled sound of classroom recitations can be heard . &nbsp; GIRL 'S VOICE ( o.s. from classroom above camera level ) Amo , amas , amat , amamus , amatis , amant . &nbsp; SECOND GIRL 'S VOICE ( o.s. from classroom below camera level ) One times nine is nine .

Suddenly , from overhead , a gong rings with a harsh , jarring noise . Doors are heard opening , feet scuffling over the floor and the light , high sound of girls ' voices chattering . A moment later a cascade of uniformed schoolgirls of all ages pours down the stairs past the camera . Against this tide one single girl makes her way . The CAMERA PANS WITH her up the remainder of the short flight of stairs and across the hallway to a door marked , PRINCIPAL . The girl knocks and from inside an over-cultured woman 's voice is heard in response . &nbsp; MRS . LOWOOD 'S VOICECome in , please . 2 CLOSE SHOT Mary Gibson at the door . She hesitates before opening it . She is young and her youth gives her prettiness , but something in the quiet serenity of her face and the clear candor of the eyes show the innate niceness of the girl ; a quality of character which will give her real beauty as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by her unexpected summons by the Head Mistress . 3 MED . CLOSE SHOT of Mary as she opens the door and looks expectantly toward the desk . No one is there . &nbsp; MRS . LOWOOD 'S VOICEHere we are , Mary . 4 MED . LONG SHOT as Mary walks into the room . It is a large room and every effort has been made to invest it with authority . A large Sheraton desk with side trays stands at one end . On the wall behind this desk hangs a gloomy , dour-visaged portrait of the founder of the school . The wall opposite the door is pierced by a large window . There are several bookcases with dull-looking volumes ; books of reference and encyclopedia . On top of one of these cases is the white , plaster head of Athena . The walls are covered with enormous , framed , sepia-tinted prints of the Acropolis , the Colosseum , Trajan 's Column and other celebrated ruins . Mrs. Lowood , the Principal , a solidly built lady with iron-gray hair and her assistant , Miss Gilcrist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are at a small table at the end of the room . They are cutting out paper hearts . As Mary comes up to them , Mrs. Lowood finishes cutting out a paper heart and lays down the scissors with an air of satisfaction .

LOWOODI have a most painful matter to discuss with you , Mary . Mary looks concerned . Mrs. Lowood has reached her desk , while Mary stands wondering what might come next . Mrs. Lowood deliberately seats herself and puts her fingertips together firmly . Over this Gothic arch she speaks to Mary . Miss Gilcrist takes her accustomed place beside her . &nbsp; MRS . LOWOOD ( cont 'd ) Your sister  --  have you heard from her lately ? &nbsp; MARYNo , Mrs. Lowood , she does n't write often . &nbsp; MRS . LOWOODHave you any other relatives , Mary ?

We 've been unable to get in touch with your sister . &nbsp; MARY ( relieved ) Sometimes she can be quite careless . Why do n't you try Mrs. Redi ?  --  5  --  &nbsp; MRS . LOWOODI have written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi . She vouchsafes no information whatsoever . ( pauses ) It is six months since your tuition has been paid , Mary . Naturally , it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil . &nbsp; MARY ( in a small voice ) Of course . &nbsp; MRS . LOWOODMiss Gilcrist and I have talked it over . You can remain here and work with the younger children as a sort of assistant teacher . These Valentine cut-outs for instance  --  ( holds one up )  --  it 's something you could do . She starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARYBut , Mrs. Lowood , I ca n't just stay here not knowing what 's happened to my sister . Maybe if I went to New York  --  if I saw Mrs. Redi myself  --  &nbsp; MRS .

Of course , my dear , if you do n't find your sister , you can always come back here . &nbsp; MARY ( catching the note of highminded dismissal ) Thank you . She turns and starts for the door . Miss Gilcrist goes with her .  --  6  --  5 INT . HALLWAY OUTSIDE MRS . LOWOOD 'S OFFICE - DAY Mary comes out of Mrs. Lowood 's office , closely followed by Miss Gilcrist , who closes the door softly behind her . &nbsp; MISS GILCRISTMary , do n't come back . No matter if you never find your sister  --  no matter what happens to you  --  do n't come back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( cont 'd ) ( in a kindly , more explanatory tone ) My parents died when I was a pupil . I left , as you are leaving , but I did n't have courage  --  one must have courage to really live in the world  --  I came back . The two stand looking at each other for a moment , while Mary realizes what her future may be  --  what Miss Gilcrist is  --  then suddenly the ringing notes of Mrs. Lowood 's voice come from the other side of the door . &nbsp; MRS . LOWOOD 'S VOICEGilcrist ! Miss Gilcrist starts , turns automatically to open the door , then looks back at Mary . With a fond glance , she pats her arm before opening the door and going on into Mrs. Lowood 's office . DISSOLVE 6 INT . STAIRWAY - HIGHCLIFFE ACADEMY - LATE AFTERNOON The stained glass window .

She carries her bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily classroom recitations . &nbsp; FRENCH STUDENT 'S VOICEJe cherche Tu cherches Ell cherche Nous cherchons Vous cherchez Elles cherchent  --  7  --  The French lesson dies away and we hear Mrs. Lowood 's voice . &nbsp; MRS . LOWOOD 'S VOICEAgnes  --  ! John Quincy Adams did not follow John Adams as President . Mary smiles . In the distance some young girl 's fingers falter awkwardly over the melancholy chords of Traumerei . Mary reaches the bottom of the stairway and passes the big , fumed-oak grandfather 's clock which stands with majestic infinity of time , reminding all tardy students that it is later than they know . As she passes it , it rings the hour . She looks at its friendly , familiar face , and gives it a little pat of farewell . O.s we hear a sweeping girl 's voice reciting the final verse of " The Chambered Nautilus .

Let each new temple , nobler thanthe lastShut thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length art free , Leaving thine outgrown shell bylife 's unresting sea ; With this burst of poetic encouragement , Mary crosses the hallway , opens the door and passes out of Highcliffe Academy , closing the door behind her .

The powder falls into a large barrel , but the column of powder and its attendant dust hide from view the three figures behind it . We hear the throaty voice of Mrs. Redi . &nbsp; MRS . REDI 'S VOICEThat 's enough . There is a click as the apparatus is turned off . The powder stops falling . Three people are disclosed . Mary , still in her travelling suit ; Mrs. Redi , a neat , businesslike woman , with firm features and a steady eye .  --  8  --  Her hair is extremely well coifed . Not a strand is out of place . Her clothes are covered by a long , white surgeon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a workman , dressed in a white smock and wearing a long , snouted , inhalator mask , which he removes , revealing a benign and smiling face . Mrs. Redi rubs a bit of the powder on the palm of her hand . She examines it critically . &nbsp; MRS . REDI ( to Joseph ) It seems all right , Joseph . ( turning to Mary with a strained smile ) You see , we do keep up the quality of La Jeunesse products in spite of Jacqueline 's absence . She and Mary start down the line of machines toward a funnel and tube arrangement set up for filling bottles . The CAMERA DOLLYS WITH them . &nbsp; MARY ( as they go , evidently resuming a previous discussion ) But you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister . &nbsp; MRS .

REDI ( cont 'd ) Your sister had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was only the manager of her plant . She sets down the bottle and they move on . The CAMERA GOES WITH them . Mary , embarrassed , looks at her . They have reached a machine which pours luke-warm cleansing cream into great jars . As one of the jars slides out from the machine , Mrs. Redi picks it up , rubs a bit of cream from the top of the jar onto the back of her hand , and judges the rapidity with which the cream dissolves at body temperature . Evidently it meets with her approval , for she passes on and goes toward her office . Mary goes with her . At the door they stop a moment .  --  9  --  &nbsp; MARYMrs . Redi , there 's one thing  --  with Jacqueline gone , how do you carry on the business ? What do you do with the receipts ? How do you sign checks  --  ? &nbsp; MRS .

REDI ( still smiling ) Yes  --  and I must say I 've done very well with it  --  perhaps even better than Jacqueline . They move on toward Mrs. Redi 's office . 8 INT . SALON - LA JEUNESSE - DAY Mary and Mrs. Redi come into the salon . Beauty operators are at work on patrons in several of the booths . The modernistic glass walls , some patterned with stripes , the mirrors , and the gleaming gadgets make of this ordinary room a rather fantastic and distorted place . &nbsp; MARYThere 's nothing you can think of  --  old letters , anything , that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline ? &nbsp; MRS . REDILeave me your address , and if I find anything , I 'll get in touch with you . &nbsp; MARYI 'm stopping at the Chatsworth . &nbsp; MRS . REDI ( with an air of dismissal ) Thank you , my dear .

This is Frances , a tense , nervous young woman , with bleached blond hair and excited , nervous eyes . &nbsp; FRANCIS ( with great friendliness ) Why , Mary ! &nbsp; MARYHello , Frances . &nbsp; FRANCISHow 's Miss Jacqueline ? &nbsp; MARYI do n't know . That 's why I came to see Mrs. Redi . I 'm trying to find her . &nbsp; FRANCISYou mean Miss Jacqueline 's gone , and you do n't know where she is ? Mary nods . Frances beckons to Mary , and they pass through a side door into a corridor that connects the plant with the street . 10 INT . CORRIDOR - LA JEUNESSE COSMETICS , INC. - DAY It is a narrow , gloomy passage . The two girls come into it from the side door . Frances fishes a package of cigarettes from her pocket , takes one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get this . Miss Jacqueline was always so fond of you  --  she was always talking about you  --  had your picture in her office . &nbsp; MARYI know . For the first time I 'm beginning to be frightened . I almost feel as if I 'd never known my sister . &nbsp; FRANCISNothing 's happened to her . It 's just that I ca n't understand her not getting in touch with you .  --  11  --  &nbsp; MARYI ca n't understand it at all . &nbsp; FRANCISWell , do n't worry . I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago . I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to  --  an Italian place down in the Village  --  " The Dante . " &nbsp; MARY " The Dante ? " &nbsp; FRANCISIt 's on Peary Street . Just ask the people who run it . They 'll remember her .

She starts to return to the salon , but Frances indicates to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the long hallway . The two girls smile at each other . Frances turns back into the salon , and Mary starts down the corridor . 11 EXT . DISPLAY WINDOW AND SIDE ENTRANCE - LA JEUNESSE COSMETICS , INC. - DAY Mary comes out of the side entrance and passes the display window . She looks up for a moment at the words " La Jeunesse " and at the peculiar trade-mark of the company . It is on this peculiar trade-mark , a geometric figure , that the scene DISSOLVES Section Details 12 EXT . STREET CORNER - PEARY STREET - GREENWICH VILLAGE - DAY It is after three o'clock , and the street is alive with children . A covey of them flash past on roller skates , tailed by one poor urchin with only one skate , who strives desperately to keep up with the tail end of the procession . Mary , coming around the corner , has to draw back half a step to get out of his way . A horse-drawn laundry truck stands at the curb on the opposite side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of soiled wash . On the other side of the street is the Dante . It is an Italian restaurant , a half-flight below the street level . The name and the word " Restaurant " are written on the glass in gold letters .  --  12  --  In the lower left hand corner of the window is a cardboard sign , hand-lettered to read " Rooms for Rent . " Above the doorway is a polychrome bust of Dante . Mary crosses the street to enter the Dante . A young man , Jason Hoag , comes around the corner . He is a man about thirty-five years old , and rather poorly dressed in an ordinary business suit and trench coat . Under one arm he carries a load of books . He stops and looks at Mary with interest . She continues on , going down the steps , under the Dante statue , and into the restaurant . Jason looks after her . 13 INT . DINING ROOM - DANTE RESTAURANT - DAY This is a fairly good-sized room , with benches along the walls and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a reproduction of the famous painting which shows Dante 's first meeting with Beatrice . Dante is passing along the cobbled street , and Beatrice , with two companions , large , flourishing wenches , is casting him a coy look over her shoulder in passing . Directly under the feet of the poet is a small table for one patron . On a back counter stands an enormous , shining metal coffee machine . This is a patented contraption for making coffee . The entire machine is contrived to serve only one small purpose  --  to make a cup of coffee by driving steam through ground coffee . Near this machine and flanking the door into the kitchen are fake palms in wooden tubs . There is a door leading to the house hallway , and through this door we can see the newel post of the stairway leading to the rooms above . On most of the tables , platters of antipasto have been arranged in readiness for the dinner hour . When Mary enters , the restaurant is empty , but echoes to the sound of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " Caro Mio Ben . " Mary looks around , hesitates a moment , and then starts toward the back of the restaurant , as if following the source of the singing . At the swinging door which separates the restaurant from the kitchen Mary hesitates a moment , then knocks timidly . The singing continues , and realizing that her knock will not be heard above it , Mary shyly pushes open the door . 14 INT . KITCHEN - DANTE RESTAURANT - DAY This is a cluttered , busy , stoaming kitchen . In one corner at a little table Mr. Romari , the proprietor , in a waiter 's uniform , is busily folding napkins . Mrs. Romari herself , from whose bosom come the sounds of " Caro Mio Ben , " can be seen through a cloud of steam behind a boiling kettle of spaghetti . She is a tall , gracious Italian of sentiment and humor . Her pet pigeon is in close attendance at her feet . This bird follows her wherever she goes , hopping about the floor at her heels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the stove and carry it to a center table , she softly kicks the pigeon out of her way with a practiced backward sweep of her slippered foot . Her turn brings her face to face with Mary as she enters . Both the Romaris look at her questioningly.  --  13  --  &nbsp; MARYI 'm sorry to bother you . I want to ask you about my sister . &nbsp; ROMARI ( getting up ) Yes ? &nbsp; MARYI thought you might know her . She was seen here about a week ago . Her name is Jacqueline Gibson . &nbsp; ROMARI ( shrugging ) I do n't know no Gibson . This is a restaurant . Many people come here . &nbsp; MARYShe 's very beautiful . Romari shrugs again . &nbsp; MARY ( cont 'd ) I wish I could tell you what she looked like  --  I know you 'd remember her . She is tall  --  with dark hair  --  Romari shrugs . This all means nothing to him . &nbsp; MARY ( cont 'd ) Once you 'd seen my sister you 'd never forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romari ) Giacomo  --  la bellissima madonna  --  &nbsp; ROMARIMaybe . &nbsp; MRS . ROMARI ( to Mary ) Let me look at you  --  you could be her sister  - -  -  &nbsp; MARY ( smiling ) Yes  --  yes , if she made that much impression on you , I 'm sure it was Jacqueline . &nbsp; MRS . ROMARIShe 's not been here for a long time . &nbsp; MARYBut she was here ?  --  14  --  &nbsp; MRS . ROMARIOh yes , yes . One day a beautiful car comes here . This beautiful lady in furs gets out . There is a handsome man with her , and the chauffeur . The lady rents one of our upstairs rooms . The chauffeur changes the lock on the door . Then the lady never comes back  --  not to live , anyhow . She came back three , four times , but always alone and just to eat . Mary shakes her head in puzzlement . &nbsp; MARYYou mean she just came here , rented the room , locked it , and left ? &nbsp; MRS . ROMARIYes  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me see that room ? If it is hers , there might be something there to help me find my sister . &nbsp; ROMARI ( shaking his head ) No  --  the rent is paid . The lady asked us to promise . I would n't open the door . &nbsp; MARYPlease . Romari shakes his head . &nbsp; MARY ( cont 'd ) ( turning to Mrs. Romari , pleading ) It 's important  - -   - -   Mrs. Romari looks at her kindly . DISSOLVE 15 INT . UPPER HALLWAY - DANTE - DAY Mary and the Romaris . It is a bleak hallway with a narrow strip of worn carpet running down the exact middle of the floor space . A picture of St. Francis of Assisi , surrounded by fluttering white birds , hangs on the wall , a little bit askew . Mrs. Romari and Mary stand near the stairway railing , with the pigeon in close attendance on Mrs. Romari . Romari , with a toolbox at his feet , is at the door , on which is the number " 7 . " He has taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few blows to remove the pin from the top hinge .  --  15  --  As he works , a girl  --  " Mimi "  --  crosses in the background from one hallway door to another . She is a tall , thin blonde and is wearing a faded bathrobe . She has a handkerchief over her lips , and is coughing dismally . She closes the door behind her . &nbsp; ROMARIFo come ti pare . Io desiderare sempre di vedere che cosa c'era in quella stanza . &nbsp; MARY ( turning to Mrs. Romari ) What did he say ? &nbsp; MRS . ROMARI ( translating ) He says he always wanted to see the inside of that room anyway . The top hinge comes off . Mr. Romari opens the door , and the three press forward . 16 INT . JACQUELINE 'S ROOM - DAY The CAMERA IS SHOOTING OVER the shoulders and PAST the half-lost profiles of Mary and the Romaris , as they look into the room . It is a room that is empty except for two objects . From a pipe overhead is suspended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gilt chair . There is nothing else . DISSOLVE 17 INT . DINING ROOM - DANTE - DAY MED . SHOT of Jason Hoag . He is standing shyly beside the coffee machine while Mr. Romari draws a cup of the coffee . Jason watches Romari while he pulls the various levers , releases the clouds of steam and finally pulls out the little demi-tass and puts it on a little tray . While Jason watches , he listens to conversation going on nearby , &nbsp; POLICEMAN 'S VOICEI tell you , young lady , when a thing like this comes up , you 've got to go to the police . What do you think people pay taxes for ? It ai n't just to keep us chasing after crooks and regulatin ' traffic . We 're supposed to help everybody .

The policeman is in a heavy blue sweater , with his coat over his arm , his uniform cap on the back of his belt and all the metal weight of his impedimenta can be seen hanging from his belt , handcuffs , revolver , billy , etc .

He addresses the policeman . &nbsp; JASONI 've had some experience with the Bureau of Missing Persons  - -  -  &nbsp; POLICEMANYeah  --  well , Mr. Hoag , lost persons are the concern of the Missing Persons Bureau . &nbsp; ROMARIYou 're a poet , Jason . You stick to your poetry . &nbsp; JASONIn a way that makes everything my business . &nbsp; MARY ( a little hesitantly , to Jason ) Were you going to make a suggestion ? &nbsp; JASONYes . I was going to tell you to look into your own heart  --  do you really want to find your sister ? Mary looks affronted . Mrs. Romari bursts out laughing in rich good humor . &nbsp; MRS .

BUREAU OF MISSING PERSONS - DAY FULL SHOT . A long counter divides the room in half . On one side are the filing cabinets , records , and office equipment used by the policemen who service this heartbreak house . Behind the desk , protected by steel wickets , sit half a dozen policemen taking down dates . CAMERA DOLLIES SLOWLY FORWARD parallel to the counter . As it moves along , we hear the voice of the petitioners describing their loved ones . The same flat , unemotional professional voice seems to ask the routine questions at each of the different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only sixteen  --  &nbsp; FIRST POLICEMAN 'S VOICEHad she ever run away before ? &nbsp; SECOND POLICEMAN 'S VOICEWhat did he have on when last seen ? &nbsp; SECOND VOICE ( a woman ) ( tearfully ) He went out without his hat or his coat .

Mary starts to sign . 19 REVERSE ANGLE on the other side of the wicket . Two men stand in the f.g. , but not together . In the b.g. we see Mary 's back as she signs the police report . The man in the center is Paul Radeau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely oblivious of everything around him . The second man is Irving August , a skip-trace artist . His derby is dulled by the mists of many winters , and his dark eyes are fastened upon Mary . It is obvious that he has been listening as she made out her report . Mary finishes signing the report and turns away from the wicket . She takes scarcely more than a single step when she finds herself confronted by Irving August , who smiles at her . &nbsp; AUGUSTI 'm Irving August , private investigator . I think I can help you . Here 's my card . He produces a business card which he hands to Mary . Mary takes the card and glances at it as August continues . &nbsp; AUGUST ( cont 'd ) The name may not mean anything to you , young lady , but say the word and I 'll have your sister for you in forty-eight hours . &nbsp; MARY ( impressed ) You can ? &nbsp; AUGUST ( gesturing expansively ) Look , sister , Manhattan is only nine miles long and four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off it .

Mary turns away and goes out of scene . August is standing , staring disgustedly after her when a hand touches him on the shoulder and he turns to face Paul Radeau . &nbsp; RADEAUYou know who I am , August ? &nbsp; AUGUST ( suddenly tense and cautious ) Sure I do . &nbsp; RADEAUThen you know that if I give you a little advice , it 'll be good advice . &nbsp; AUGUSTYeah  --  sure . &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget it if I were you . &nbsp; AUGUSTOkay , Mr. Radeau , it 's forgot .

The policeman turns to the file . DISSOLVE OUT DISSOLVE IN  --  20  --  20 EXT . BELLEVUE HOSPITAL MORGUE - DAY The bulwarks and gangplank are in the f.g . The street and wharf at river level . Beyond that there are the sidewalk and the two doors leading into the morgue . The river is not seen , although the sound of tugboat and barge whistles comes o.s .

Today I found out such strange things  --  frightening things .

You look as if you were coming back to life . Are you sure you did n't faint because you were hungry ? Mary looks astonished , and then laughs to herself . &nbsp; MARYYou know . . .

August looks at her . &nbsp; AUGUSTI do n't like this . &nbsp; MARYWhich room is it ? &nbsp; AUGUSTIt 's the last door at the end of this hall .

Nearer the CAMERA a broad streak of light from a partially open door is between the darkness and the CAMERA . Mary comes out of the darkness and into this light . At the same moment , August comes out of the partially opened door , blocking out the light for a minute . His shadow goes ahead of him - contorted and strange . He stands a moment before Mary ; both of his hands clenched tightly against his stomach . She speaks to him in a whisper . &nbsp; MARYMr . August  --  the night watchman  - -  -  August makes no answer , but starts walking blindly , swaying a little , toward the street door .

Mary nods .  --  30  --  &nbsp; CONDUCTORYou 've been to the end of the line and back again  --  hope you enjoyed the ride . He passes on . Mary looks after him , frightened .

COFFEE COUNTER - DAY This is a very small counter and stand with a few tables near the window  --  the sort of restaurant that is open only for breakfast and lunch and is patronized by office workers who can content themselves with a sandwich and a cup of coffee . The scene opens on the newsboy as he comes into the restaurant and goes up to the counter . The waiter behind the counter buys a paper and brings it with an order of one cup of coffee and a glass of milk to Mary and Ward , who are sitting at a small table .

GREGORY WARD 'S OFFICE - DAY Dr. Judd comes in and walks calmly across the room . &nbsp; JUDD ( as he crosses ) I 've come from Jacqueline . She needs money . &nbsp; GREGORYI thought you told me you did n't know where she was . &nbsp; JUDD ( sprawling into a chair ) I did n't . She came to me a few days ago . To put it delicately  --  her care imposes a financial burden upon me . She thought you might lighten that burden . &nbsp; GREGORYIf Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself . &nbsp; JUDDI 'm afraid she ca n't do that , Ward . I would endanger her . &nbsp; GREGORYWhat sort of danger ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you , but I 'm fond of Jacqueline . I do n't want her to run any risks . &nbsp; GREGORYThis is nonsense ! Unless I know where Jacqueline is , and how she is , I wo n't give you any money . &nbsp; JUDD ( almost musingly ) You 're a curious man . You 're willing to jeopardize Jacqueline 's life in order to satisfy your own curiosity . &nbsp; GREGORYYou come to me with some wild story about her being in danger  --  naturally I want to know what kind of danger . I want to know where she is.  --  37  --  Gregory Ward rises and starts around the desk toward Dr. Judd . &nbsp; GREGORY ( cont 'd ) It 's not just for myself I 'm asking . Her sister is here . The kid 's half crazy with anxiety . &nbsp; JUDDAs a man , you distrust me  --  perhaps you believe me as a physician . Judd looks coolly at Gregory and Gregory nods grudgingly . &nbsp; JUDD ( cont 'd ) Well , then I can tell you that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jacqueline losing her sanity . I would advise against you seeing her . &nbsp; GREGORYBut why ? She 's been ill  --  erratic , but I 've never heard of anything like that ! &nbsp; JUDDI told you I was speaking as her physician  --  not as anything else  --  You can believe me or not , just as you choose . Gregory looks at him a moment , then turns and sits down in his chair with an air of resignation . &nbsp; GREGORY ( wearily ) How much does she want ? &nbsp; JUDDShe could use a hundred dollars . &nbsp; GREGORY ( making a motion toward his desk ) I 'll give you a check . &nbsp; JUDD ( shaking his head ) She can only use cash . Ward takes out a billfold and examines its contents .  --  38  --  &nbsp; GREGORYI have n't got that much in cash . &nbsp; JUDDHow much have you got ? &nbsp; GREGORYAbout forty-five dollars . &nbsp; JUDDFor the time being , I imagine that must do .

Judd starts for the door . &nbsp; GREGORYBut tell me  --  &nbsp; JUDD ( shrugging ) She 's nervous , naturally , under the circumstances . &nbsp; GREGORYWhat circumstances ? Judd has reached the door . He turns and grins . &nbsp; JUDDYou know that I ca n't tell you . He starts to open the door , pauses and looks back . &nbsp; JUDD ( cont 'd ) ( insolently , with the door half open ) As her physician and I am speaking as her friend now , too , I warn you that it would be extremely dangerous to attempt to see her .

You 've got to sleep two more minutes . Nancy lets herself relax on the hard floor in quiet desperation . By this time Ward has finished dialing his number . Someone has evidently answered . &nbsp; GREGORY ( into phone ) May I speak to Mr. Irving August ? From the telephone comes the sound of unintelligible conversation in an explanatory note . Ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( into phone ) I 'm very sorry . Thank you . He hangs up the receiver and turns to Mary . &nbsp; GREGORY ( cont 'd ) You were right .

FOYER FLANDERS APTS. - DAY This is a marble , gilt , and plaster horror of the General Grant rococo period . Glass and gilt iron doors give entrance to the hallway , which is floored with soiled marble slabs . At either side of the hall twin stairs rise to the apartments above , going upward with an accompaniment of gilt iron handrails . Some mail boxes , a worn velvet bench , and moth-eaten moose head complete this charming and delicate interior . A young woman is laboriously getting a baby carriage out from under one of the stairways and stowing her infant safely in its wicker hold . She has tucked him in , steered the carriage out from behind the stairway , and is crossing the hallway , when the door opens to admit Judd and Mary . &nbsp; JUDD ( holding the door open for Mary ) It 's amid such marble splendors as these that Jacqueline dwells.  --  44  --  Mary looks around . &nbsp; JUDD ( cont 'd ) You can take either stairway  --  I prefer the left  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascending the left stairway . 56 INT .

He goes to his door , inserts the key , twists it and swings the door open , allowing Mary to precede him . 57 INT . JUDD 'S APT. - LATE AFTERNOON It is a cheap , furnished apartment . An Aubusson carpet is on the floor . The furniture is Grand Rapids Sheraton and the pictures on the wall are representative of hotel art at its worst , colored prints showing French canals , poplar trees and old towers . An incongruous picture , however , a huge chromo in an ornate fretwork frame dominates one wall . This is the famous picture of the guardian angel which shows a little child , gowned in white , who is about to fall over a precipice were it not for the benign hand of her guardian angel , a figure complete with white robe and white wings . Under this picture is a bureau . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expedient of removing one drawer and re-inserting it so that the bottom of the drawer can be used as a base for a typewriter . On this overturned drawer stand a portable typewriter , a box full of paper , some loose manuscript and a marmalade jar full of pencils Between a pair of bookends are about four volumes with the author 's name - Louis Judd - plainly evident on the dust jackets . They are the only books in the room . At the end of the room is a small , useless sort of desk . This has been made into a dressing table by putting a fitted toilet case on top and opening it .

FLANDERS ARMS - JUDD 'S APARTMENT - DAY Judd , dressed in a dressing gown , is seated on the straight chair before the makeshift desk , talking with Mrs. Cortez who is dressed in street clothes and who has perched herself on the arm of a large , overstuffed chair . They have evidently been talking for some time . The scene opens with a slight lull in the conversation , while Judd takes a cigarette and lights it , blows out the first inhalation of smoke and looks squarely at Mrs. Cortez . &nbsp; JUDDI know the others  --  Redi , Fallon , Leo , Bruns .

Mary is humming or whistling the song that Mrs. Romari was singing downstairs . She lifts her hand to soap the back of her neck .

An alcohol stove keeps the tea water hot and a slight steam rises from the tea kettle . Among the guests can be seen certain familiar faces . Frances Fallon stands near the door talking with a young man , Mr. Durk , who can be recognized as one of the two drunks who supported the body of Irving August on the subway . The other of the two drunks , Mr. Leo , is seated by himself in an armchair looking through a record album .

Behind it the night sky can be seen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a bed , an easy chair and a desk with a typewriter stand beside it . The walls of the room are almost hidden by bookcases and books , and even the mantel bears a burden of numerous volumes . Jason is seated at his desk , turned toward the typewriter . He types a line , reads it inaudibly and at the same time beats out the rhythm with his left hand on the desk top . Evidently it scans , because he types another line and is about to repeat the rhythmic test on it , when there is a small knock on the door . He gets up , crosses the room and opens the door . Mary stands outside . She is dressed in the little traveling suit she wore in the first sequence and wears a hat . &nbsp; JASON ( pulling her into the room ) Mary !

WASHINGTON NEWS - NIGHT Jacqueline comes out of Mrs. Cortez ' apartment and stands for a moment in a broad patch of light thrown by the open door . Behind her this door closes and she is suddenly in darkness . She looks apprehensively into the shadows and then quite hesitantly begins to walk to the right . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avenue can be seen . Washington News , itself , is full of dark shadows . She is exhausted and unnerved . She walks slowly . She passes one place where the out-jutting of the building casts a deeper shadow on the sidewalk . A garbage can is set behind the out-jutting , this and the bough of an old ailanthus combine to cast a man-like shadow beside the shadow of the building . Jacqueline pauses , peers intently into the shadow , then summons up courage enough to pass . She walks quickly past the out-jutting building . Somewhat relieved , she walks a little bit more confidently . Suddenly , there is a clatter and bang of metal behind her . She gasps , startled , and whirls around 116 A white dog with a long bony tail slinks away from a garbage can . The lid of this can is still oscillating from its fall and roll . 117 Jacqueline draws her coat more closely about her and goes on . Ahead of her , thrown by the thin light from a transo above a door , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and across the street . She hesitates then starts to cross the street diagonally , looking back all the while at the doorway . From the center of the street it can be seen that a man stands there . With him stands a woman , her figure somewhat lost in the doorway . They are saying good night . On the opposite side of the street , Jacqueline hurries toward the Avenue .  --  105  --  118 EXT . THE AVENUE - NIGHT With evident relief , Jacqueline comes out of the darkness of Washington News to the more brightly lighted avenue . Traffic is passing and people are all about her . She starts off up the avenue with confidence . Then , some premonition makes her turn . Only a few paces behind her is Leo , and there is a grin on his lean , satyr-like face . She hurries her step . Behind her Leo quickens his pace . She peers into the faces of passers-by , seeking some unpreoccupied person who might be sympathetic and helpful . People pass her , intent on their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leo merely lengthens his stride . It is easy for him to keep up with her . A few people turn their heads to watch her run , but Leo 's long strides attract no attention . Suddenly , in desperation , she dashes across the street . A cab narrowly misses hitting her and a bus , coming from the other direction , has to stop with an appalling scream and roar of brakes . Jacqueline , shaken , out of breath and trembling , reaches the other corner of the street . She pauses for a moment to take a deep breath . She looks back of her . There is no sign of Leo . Again she starts on and from the shadow of a light standard a deeper shadow detaches itself and steps out behind her . It is Leo and he is grinning . She sees him and begins to run down the cross street . She runs wildly . Leo , at first lengthens his stride , and then suddenly breaks into a lope  --  a lope that will bring him up to her within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost in the darkness . She hides in a corner amid some debris , crouching back out of the light . Leo plunges ahead in pursuit . Jacqueline stands a moment as the sound of his footsteps diminish , then turns back and begins running down the street . Ahead of her , a dark , slim figure , not unlike Leo 's , is walking up the street toward her . She dodges into the next alley . This is an alley behind a theatre . It is cluttered with all sorts of strange impedimenta ; flats , crates , etc . There is an overhead lamp burning in the center of the alley , but the periphery of the light beneath it , does not extend to the walls of the alley . The area immediately adjacent to these walls is heavy with darkness and strange shadows . Jacqueline stands in the middle of the pool of light and listens . It seems to her that she can hear in the darkness the soft tap-tap of someone walking on his toes . She shrinks back from the bright light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall . She is going from left to right . A sound at her right attracts her attention and she looks off , but continues to grope her way along the wall to the left . Her hand passes from the roughness of the wall to the smoothness of cloth , and a split second later , Leo , whom she has touched , grins as he seizes her wrist . She screams and then silently struggles to free herself . Still smiling , he holds her firmly with his right hand . With his left hand he draws something from his pocket . He presses a button on this and a four-and a-half inch knife blade flashes out . Jacqueline stands stock still with fright . Leo 's hand goes back for the blow . At the opposite side of the alley a door is suddenly thrown wide open and a great patch of light is thrown on Jacqueline and Leo . He puts the knife behind his back .  --  106  --  Out of the door come half a dozen people in costumes . They are members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerges the sound of loud and merry music . The actors are in a gay mood , laughing and shouting . One of them breaks into a half dance step . It is infectious and the rest join in , making a sort of Carmagnole that sweeps down the alley . Jacqueline breaks from Leo 's hand-hold on her wrist and runs in among them . One of the dancers is an enormous man dressed in Roman half armor to represent the god , Gambrinus , with gilded hop blooms as a garland about his shoulders and wearing a papier mache mask , surmounted by crown of similarly gilded hop leaves and wheat . The face of the mask is a grinning , jolly , rubicund visago . It is next to this enormous man that Jacqueline finds herself . In sportive mood , the giant dancer sweeps her up with one arm , forcing her to dance his grotesque steps . &nbsp; JACQUELINEPlease . Please . Let me down . There 's a man following me . &nbsp; DANCER ( in a booming voice ) I should n't wonder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious  --  help me . &nbsp; DANCERI 'll help you to a beer and a sandwich . Come along , babe , come along . The whole party of dancers with Jacqueline among them , go roaring out of the alley . 119 EXT . STREET CORNER - NIGHT On the street corner is a beer saloon . The dancers , some of them still skipping and dancing , come around and go into the brilliantly lit saloon . The dancer with Jacqueline tries to pull her into the saloon . She fights away from him . Laughing and slapping his thighs in mirth , he leaves her and passes into the saloon . She is left alone in the street . She makes a half-hearted movement to adjust her disarranged clothing . Slowly , with great weariness , she begins to walk away from the saloon , going further and further into the darkness . She looks around . The darkness frightens her . She looks back . There is the warm glow of light from the saloon windows . She starts to go back . From the lighted end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the street as Jacqueline .

The draft in the hallway stirs this little flame and the shadows move with it . Jacqueline comes up the stairs . Now that she can be seen more closely , it can be seen also that she is exhausted , her eyes wild , her hair in disorder . She almost staggers as she reaches the landing and goes slowly supporting herself on the banisters , toward Mary 's door . Her way brings her past Room #7 , the room with the noose .

But Mimi has already turned back into her room . Jacqueline stands watching until the light snaps on in Mimi 's room and then the door closing , plunges the hall into weird half light again . In this semi-darkness , she turns away from Mary 's door and walks down the hall toward room #7 . She opens the door and goes in .

Children are hurrying by on their way to school . At a table near the window Mary sits with Gregory . She has been crying and has her sodden handkerchief in her hand . Gregory has a pre-occupied air and is tracing figures on the table cloth with his fork . Jason comes in bearing a small tray with three tiny cups of coffee on it . He puts a cup in front of each of them and keeps one for himself . He sips his coffee . Neither Mary nor Gregory touch theirs . Jason pushes Mary 's cup toward her to attract her attention . She picks it up and brings it to her lips .  --  112  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , Mary , you should n't mourn for Jacqueline . Life for her was full of the agony of a disordered mind . It 's better this way . &nbsp; MARYI keep telling myself that . &nbsp; GREGORYWell , tell yourself , Mary , that this is a world that does n't pass with the passing of anyone of us . All three of us are going to start afresh . He looks up and across at Jason with a meaningful glance at Mary . &nbsp; GREGORY ( cont 'd ) You and I have new hopes  --  and new plans can come from them  --  Jason looks at him across Mary and shakes his head . &nbsp; JASONNot I  --  I am alive , yet every hope I had is dead . ( turns to Mary ) Death can be good . Death can be happy . If I were really dying I could speak like Cyrano  --  " My courage like a white plume "  --  and all the other lovely words with which he greeted death . Then perhaps you might understand . &nbsp; MARY ( reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JASON ( suddenly smiling ) Good . We all understand each other . You , Gregory and I. We all know . There is sunlight in the streets and work to do . Both of you  --  you 're off to work . He gets up and takes Mary 's arm , helping her to rise . &nbsp; JASON ( cont 'd ) Off with you . You ca n't sit here in this cellar with the sun shining .  --  113  --  He hustles her toward the door and Gregory follows . Mary and Gregory ascend the steps to the street level . Jason steps back a pace or two so that he is backgrounded by the mural of Dante . He stands there , and the smile leaves his face . His whole body reflects his hopelessness and despair . It is at this moment that Mrs. Romari comes hustling in from the kitchen . &nbsp; MRS . ROMARIAh ! Good ! They have all gone ! Now you and I can laugh and joke again . He turns to her , forcing a smile . FADE OUT THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
