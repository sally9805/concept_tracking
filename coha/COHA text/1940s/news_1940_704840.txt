txt FRANCO MEDIATION SEEN IN STOCKHOLM Sweden Hopes a Negotiated Peace Will Avert Danger of German-Russian War By OTTO D. TOLISCHUS Wireless to THE NET , YORK TIMES . STOCKHOLM , July 2 ? Voicing the opinion of authoritative Swedish quarters the Svenska Dagbladet today issued an appeal for a compromise peace between Germany and Britain and urged that a mediator step forward to initiate negotiations to that end . After pointing out Britain 's weakened strategic position following France 's capitulation and the consequences in the Far East and also Germany 's growing concern regarding Russia 's forward march in the Baltic States and in the Balkans this leading Swedish newspaper says : " There must be a middle way between a British catastrophe and a German triumph . A mortal German-British struggle must in the end destroy irreplaceable cultural values and weaken the entire political and economic position of all Europe to such an extent as to endanger the world political leadership of the white race . " Such an outcome would serve neither Germany nor Britain even if London should for a moment be speculating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Many an outside observer finds the moment has come for a mediation attempt . But who is to take the initiative ? " Franco Believed Negotiating It is no secret that this leading article also expresses the hopes of the Swedish Government . Informed quarters here believe General Francisco Franco is already making soundings regarding peace in Berlin and London . There is an inclination here to regard the thunderous threats and defiances issuing from Berlin and London as covering manoeuvres that will turn into grim reality if the peace efforts fail . The very loudness with which Berlin announces the forthcoming invasion of Britain while assuring the world of the modesty of its peace aims , though part of the war of nerves , nevertheless is regarded as strange when compared with the strenuous German efforts to enforce silence regarding the German // FRANCO MEDIATION SEEN IN STOCKHOLM , // plans for the first offensive in the West . On the other hand Swedish newspapers that are susceptible to German influence are full of defeatist reports regarding Britain 's defenselessness and the fear of social revolution in British financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the same time Swedish peace hopes are supported by Sweden 's own wishful thinking because continuance of the war is bringing the country into an ever more difficult political and economic situation . The Russian advance into the Baltic States and the Balkans , it is realized , was made possible only because of the war in the West and it is feared that as long as that war continues Russia will continue the advance , which makes a GermanRussian conflict all the more likely . It is difficult to see how Sweden could stay out of such a conflict . Sweden and Reich Now Close This future possibility has already brought about a closer rapprochement between Germany and Sweden which in case of real danger might become too close for comfort . In such a conflict Sweden is bound to side with Germany , who is believed to be making preparations for such a contingency in the north . Any new Russian attempt against Finland , it is feared , might be the spark that might bring the war to Sweden as well . Meanwhile developments in the Baltic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports from the Russian-occupied States appear exaggerated , the drift of events appears clear . In all three States , Lithuania , Latvia and Estonia , the old authoritarian regimes , based on extensive State capitalism , have been replaced by governments of extremely Leftist Democrats , who are coming more and more under the influence of Communist elements working for outright union with Russia . Developments appear to be furthest advanced in Lithuania , where the recently legalized Communist party is the only legal political party in the State . The old authoritarian league , which had dissolved all other political parties , has now been dissolved by the new regime . The new Communist party already has many of its leaders in the government , is organizing a workers ' militia and conducts its mass meeting under the slogan , " Long live the thirteenth Soviet Republic of Lithuania . " The results of the present conferences between Russia and Lithuania are awaited , therefore , with great interest .                    @
