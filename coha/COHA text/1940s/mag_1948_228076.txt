On England 's rain-soaked Royal St. George 's links last week , two men slashed through the finals of the British Amateur golf championship . Because of the rain and high winds , neither Britain 's Charlie Stowe , a $28 a week mechanic , nor Toledo 's playboyish Frank ( " Muscles " ) Stranahan was staying abreast of par . But they stayed even with each other , with 795 on the first round . Then Stowe , completely unstarched , bowed to Stranahan 5- &-4.; At St. Louis , in the $30,000 Professional Golfers Association championship , cool Ben Hogan systematically went about chopping Mike Turnesa to pieces in the final . Hogan won 7- &-6,; collected first prize ( $3,500 ) and left for Fort Worth with a motorcycle escort sendoff . The way he felt about the P.G.A. : " You have to finish first or second to make it worth the effort and then you 're dead for weeks afterwards . "
