Iraq 's King Feisal I used to spend his spare time playing with a tame leopard . His son , King Feisal II , 11 , a more progressive monarch , has spent his summer holidays in Britain studying Western industrial methods . At an oil refinery the boy king from Bagdad sat in at a round-table discussion of scientists and technicians . In the course of the discussion one expert said : " I always find I can think much quicker when I am riding a bicycle .
