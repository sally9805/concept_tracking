From Athens last week Newsman Leland Stowe ( Chicago Daily News ) cabled his opinion that Ralph Waldo Barnes , crack war correspondent of the New York Herald Tribune , deserved a Pulitzer Prize for his work in 1940 . Eleven years before , when Stowe was head of the Herald Tribune 's Paris bureau , he himself had won a Pulitzer Prize with the aid of young Reporter Barnes , who had managed to get a beat-the full text of the Young Plan-from a delegate to the Reparations Conference in Paris . But Stowe 's suggestion was no mere logrolling . <P> A big bear of a man , endowed with inexhaustible energy , a hunger for facts , Ralph Barnes was at 41 one of the best informed journalists in Europe . He had covered most of the Continent at top speed-but his most remarkable year was 1940 . When the year opened he was reporting a somnolent war with the B. E. F. Then he was transferred to Berlin , the first newsman to cover both sides of World War II .

When the pilot realized he was off his course , he dropped a flare that lighted up the hills , showed the sheer rock face of a bluff looming ahead . He dropped one bomb to lighten the plane , had no chance to release another . On a desolate peak near Danilovgrad , in neutral Yugoslavia , Ralph Barnes died in action with three men of the R. A.
