ON an autumn morning of the year 1800 , the Reverend Abiel . Holmes , aged thirty-six , handsome , widowed , and lonely , sat down in his study near Harvard Square in Cambridge , Massachusetts , to begin the writing of his new book . It was to be called American Annals , and the very contemplation of it caused its author 's blood to run faster . Since that clay when , a boy of fifteen , as poor as he was eager , he had traveled down from Woodstock to enter Yale College , there had run in the veins of Abiel Holmes this unremitting sense of adventure where things of the mind were concerned . So would it run , and so would this excitement mount in the veins of his son Oliver Wendell ' Holmes and his son 's son of that same name . Minister of the First Parish in Cambridge , Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table , Justice of the Supreme Court ? none made liters titre his calling . But all three lived hard and wrote what . they lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the living . Abiel Holmes , lifting his eyes from the piles of scribbled , carefully documented notes on his desk , looked out the window across the parsonage yard to where bare maple branches swept low over a board fence , hiding the red bricks of the college beyond . In the middle of the yard the free end of the long CATHEMNB DausEiNt BowEN , essayist and the biographer of Tchaikovsky and the Itubinsteins , grew up in Bethlehem , Pennsylvania . She now lives in Bryn Mawr . For more than three years she has been at work on her biography of Justice Holmes . She says , " why did I , being neither lawyer nor professional philosopher , undertake to write a book about Justice Holmes ? I think because these are times when it is good to know about . Americans who believed in their country , who worked for their country wit h all their might , and who had a good time doing it . I wanted to Ihrots ' myself into the long study of just such a man . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' I think it is required of a man that he should share the action and passion of his Cane at peril of being judged not to have lived . ' ' Certainly Holmes shared I he action and passion of his country on the soldier 's field as well as on the judge 's bench . And the ritlantic and its readers are privileged to share with Mrs. Bowen her study of that splendid Man and servant of his country . 134 , pump arm slanted skyward . Old Liza had left it up again , Abiel noted . Why did n't she wait and let him carry in the water as he had told her so often ? Liza was getting too old to keep this big ramshackle house . Even Mary Holmes had hated it . The image of his young wife , dead five years , rose dimly before Abiel . . . Mary Stiles . What this parsonage needed , Mary 's widower reflected now , was a wife . Frowning , Abiel turned back to his desk . This was no time to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would begin these Annals at the beginning , with Columbus , and he would keep on with them , God willing , until his hand was too palsied to hold a pen . Abiel Holmes loved challenge and looked as if he loved it . Under the clerical gown and bib his shoulders were broad ; his thick dark hair hung to his shoulders , curling crisply at the ends ; his level , deep eyes sparkled with health , his color was high . He wore the dark robe of Calvinism with an air and loved the religion it symbolized . Abiel had a warm pride in his country ? and a Calvinist conscience that translated pride quickly into a sense of debt . When you were proud of something , you got out and worked for it . Ablel came honestly by his patriotism . His father , Captain David Holmes , had fought in two American wars and , worn out , lead died at fifty-seven , leaving seven sons and a daughter to help build the country he had fought for . Abiel was fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Canadian wilderness . Captain Holmes , fighting Indians in the Old French War of 1758 , had walked single file through the forests with his men , dressed in a soldier 's hat and fringed leggings , carrying his flintlock on his hip . Was it history , Abiel wondered now , sitting at his desk by a quiet Cambridge window ? was that history which had happened to one 's own father ? Was it history that his father 's friend , Major Putnam , was captured outside Fort Ann and tied to a tree by the Indians , fagots piled around him ? Was it history how he escaped and how , seventeen years later , the Major and Captain Holmes , on hearing the first news of Lexington , joined the Continental Army and served four long years ? Surely , these things were at least the footnote to history ! Surely , thought Abiel Holmes , his quill gone dry above his paper ? surely a man could put these things into footnotes without being charged with immodesty ? Well , he hail his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain 's own hand during the wilderness campaigns of ' 58 ; if he worked from them rather than from word of Judah , it should be as authoritative as any other source . ' there was so much of history that Abiel knew by word of mouth ! How could he pass it by ? It was in his blood . His mother and his mother 's mother had told him stories . If the men of the family were advent ( treys and soldiers , the women had been remarkably articulate for their clay , even learned . Grandmother newel. , for instance . Abiel rememliered her , at eighty-five , pink and pretty , with gentle Ina/iers and a spicy way of talking . She had taught herself to read Latin back in the times when you might wake any black night to find a tomahawk quivering in your cabin door . " When I was a girl , " she had told Abiel , " I begged to go to school with the boys . But the elders were angry , and said Latin was not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' they said , ' and learn to spin and weave . ' So I taught myself to read Virgil . ' Forsan et haec olint meminisse juvabil , ' " said Grandmother Hewet soh ly , in her light old voice . " Abiel , 1 still find it beautiful . " Abiel was a passionate antiquarian and scholar . Some of his sermons had been printed , and he had published a biography of his late father-in-law , President . Ezra Stiles of Yale College . He had read histories of states and histories of towns , clerical accounts and military accounts and the records of travelers who wrote in Spanish and French and Latin and English . As lie read , it seemed extraordinary that no one had written of the country as a whole . It was fortunate for the Annals that Abiel was also a I veled man . lie had been twice to Georgia and hack , traveling by stagecoach and saddle horse . Indeed , he had not only been to Georgia but he had lived there four years as a minister in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he settled in Cambridge as minister , Abiel brought with hint ? 1 view of his country that went far beyond the First Parish . Almost immediately , he began writing to his friends in faraway places , begging historical facts . To friends in Georgia and in Virginia , in t lie Carolinas and westward in Tennessee . ary facts , economic facts , facts of American church history , jumbled together , set clown any old way . Abiel Holmes lived history day by day , writing it on the run , setting it down as it happened . And now the facts were gathered , they lay on Abiel 's desk , overflowing the shelves of his study , neat in their folders , ready to be " written . " Abiel clipped his quill : ? he wrote on the title page . AIJICI left a blank for the second date . How long would lie survive ? It was a clan of octogenarians. he continued , and paused . he wrote , and put his pen down and looked with satisfaction at the page . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin looked well , under his name . Abiel put the sheet aside and took a fresh one . This was , now , the true beginning . Should he say a prayer , ask the guidance of Him without Whose inspiration no man could write a hook about anything ? But the first sentence was already formed ; the words burned in their author 's mind . Abiel Holmes did not wait to pray . The blood came up in his face , and moved by the panorama of his country 's history , his prose that had been so dry , so correct , swung out with a bold cadence that was new to him :  --  A NEW WORLD has been discovered , which has been receiving inhabitants from the old , inure than three hundred years , A new empire has arisen , which has been a theatre of great actions and stupendous events . . . . 2 Jose after New Year 's day , 1801 , a young Boston girl named Louisa Storrow wrote a el/ditty little note to an absent mother : ? Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Abiel Holmes , of Cambridge , whom we so kindly chalked out for Miss N. W. , is going to be married , and , of all folks in the world , guess who to . Miss Sally Wendell . I tun sure you will not believe it ; however , it is un alisolide fact , for Ilarriot and daekson told Miss P. Russell so , who told us ; it had liven kept secret for six weeks , nobody knows for what . I could not believe it for some time , and scarcely can now ; however , it is a fact they say . Sally Wendell did not wait till June for her wedding . At our age , she told Abiel , there is no tune to lose . We will be married at the end of March in your Meetinghouse , and we will invite everybody in Cambridge and Boston . Abiel smiled . Be did not like the practical details of life . 1 low good it was to have , suddenly , this brisk tiny creature arranging everything ! The Wendells knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Abiel they were related to everyone . Wendells , Jacksons , Olivers , Dudleys , Cabots , Idiots , Quineys , Bradstreets , Phillipses ? these were Sally 's cousins and forebears . They had had their port rails painted by Copley and Stuart ; they had gone to London and dined with titled cousins of the great world and had brought home silver plate and furniture by Chippendale . It seemed to Abiel Holmes extraordinary , when he stopped to think of it , that he , the son of Captain I In vid and Temperance II-oh-nes , was marrying the granddaughter of Colonel Wendell who had lost forty buildings in the great Boston fire of 1762 . To lose forty buildings ? It implied a kingdom ! Abiel could live on ? 150 a year and had clone it ( wit h " findings " from the parish ) . But I his fact of the buildings stuck in his imagination as it would stick also in the imagination of his son Oliver fifty years later . Abiel occupied , most certainly , a position of leadership in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether different from the prestige that comes from being n Wendell , ; t . Quincy , a Jackson , with silver plate by Lanierie and a table set with Siwres porcelain . In March , 1801 , Thomas Jefferson was inaugural ed Ibird president of the United States , bringing wit I ) him a new era and a new philosophy . He strode through the Capitol , fiery-eyed , tense with purpose . And John Adams , staunch and stubborn , representative of a century that was past , rose to his feet and , turning his back on the White House and a world that had treated him unkindly , went home to his farm at . Quincy , Massachusetts . In his barnyard he found it hundred loads of seaweed . A tine load of manure , said Mr. Adams , paraphrasing Horace , was fair exchange for the honors and virtues of the world . And in that same month of March , in the First Parish Church of Cambridge , Sarah Wendell became Mrs. Abiel Holmes and , without benefit of wedding journey , walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge of the parsonage . Already the old house wore a different aspect . Its new mistress had had it swept and garnished and had brought roomfuls of handsome Mrniture ? cabinets and tables and lowboys and highboys of dark satiny wood . Every cockroach had been banished and the long pump arm no more slanted crazily . It had been replaced with a newfangled thing one pumped up and down ; even the cracked old bucket was gone . Abiel Hohnes found life suddenly extraordinarily pleasant . He was deeply in love with his wife . In his study , writing the Annals , preparing his sermons , he thought of Sally , listened for her high , clear voice down the steep stairway . It troubled him , this passionate connubiality . Was it quite in keeping with God 's representative ? and a man of nearly forty at that ? In his diary Abiel recorded a story his mother had told him ; it came very close to home , bothering Abiel with a little feeling of shame concerning himself . After his father died , his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she rejected , apparently , with scorn . When Abiel was nearly twenty , a very respectable man had begun visiting her , with obvious intent . Mrs. Holmes desired to put a stop to this before it reached an open declarations . One evening , leading her suitor into the parlor , she prayed MID to listen while she read some favorite lines from Young 's Night Thoughts . The suitor was all smiles and ears . Was not poetry , after all , the prelude to love ? read Temperance Holmes serenely , her face bland , " our thoughts and aims are green , Like damaged clocks , whose hand and bell dissent , Folly sings six , while Nature points at twelve . " Her success was complete ; the disheartened suitor disappeared without further importuning . That , said Abiol 's conscience , was the way to treat love in middle age . But the story bothered him . One night he told it to Sally on the way home from prayer meeting . It was summer and the maple leaves beside their door were heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice and laugh were elaborately casual . But Sally did not laugh at his story . " Abiel , " she said , " why are you afraid to be happy ? Surely the Lord loves a cheerful heard And besides , did n't the Reverend Dr. Mather himself have t hree wives before he was done , and fifteen diihlren ? ? her voice quickened ; there was a matter-of-factness in it that never failed to reach Ahiel , culling straight through the tortured la hyrin th of his introspection ? " people do n't have to be dreary to be good . " lvil b Sally in the parsonage , Able ! Holmes found little time for introspection . The house seemed filled with people , coming and going . Sally knew the private troubles of everyone in the parish , worried over them , sympathized , shed tears . She was always buying presents for somebody 's baby or fflitchody 's grandinot her . Within a year after they were married , Sally presented her husband with a daughter . Mary Jackson Holmes , they named her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep happiness . Around him life moved and flowed , quietly , but with a cease of accomplishment , fruition . in 1805 the .. linerieas Annals appeared , Iwo stout volumes which were received everywhere with acclaim . Edinburgh University gave Abiel an honorary degree in absentia , and in London the Quarterly Review gave praise most unusual for an American book . LIE favourable reception of this work in the United States , and its republication in London , encouraged me to extend my researches in order to wader it more full and exact . . . . , " wrote Ablel in the Preface to the second edition of his work , twenty-three years later . " To literary gentlemen and correspondents I have been indebted for answers to historical inquiries , and for the use of rare books . My particular tteknowledgments are due to the late president JEurEasotst , who , approving the plan of the work , sent me from his own library several books , of which I have never seen any other copies . " A second term . It was amazing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , in March , 1805 , that the country had weathered the past four Republican years as well as it had . Abiel smiled . How vehement the Judge became and his friends with him ? when the name of Jefferson was ment ioned ! Abiel had heard the Judge ictsally follow the word " Jefferson " with the word - tyrant . " When their pockets were touched , men 's judgment became instantly distorted . The temper of Boston , Abiel thought sometimes , ? and did not sac it ,  --  was changing . She cared less for outrages to the Rights of Man , and more for outrages to her brisk shipping interests . Touch a Massachusetts man in his pocket and the thrust went through to the heart and was immediately defended in terms of great principles . Jefferson 's embargo was not spoken of as a nuisance . It was , said Boston , a threat to our Federation , a threat to freedom , to the principles of Washington and the Founding Fathers . Thomas Jefferson , Judge Wendell said , would not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . Was he not an avowed atheist ? Abiel Holmes was not afraid ; he knew the old religion would stand . lie was not even made apprehensive by the recent appointment , at Harvard , of it Unitarian as professor of theology , although the appointment had caused as much talk around town as the presidential election . Henry Ware was a brilliant man , certainly , and a very dangerous influence to youth ; several parents had already withdrawn their sons from the university because of him . This new doctrine of Unitarianism was insidious . Expose your son to it and before the month was out he was talking about " free will " and gibing openly at the notion ? stamped plainly in the New England Primer ? that " In Adam 's fall , We sinned all . " Deliberately , Abiel omitted Ware 's appointment from the Annals for 1805 , although he saw fit to include the new professorship of natural history and the erection of a college rooming house . The best way to silence these new creeds was to ignore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aide ! Holmes had as yet 110 conception of the fires that smoldered beneath his very pulpit ; nor that these embers , bursting at last into flame , would be a con.lt.gration to drive him from his own Meetinghouse door . He thought of himself as a liberal-minded man . Was not one of his best ft ands a Unitarian ? Young William Ellery Channing , who had come from Newport three years ago as proctor at the University , had promptly joined Abiel 's church . The next year , when Charming was ordained minister in the Federal Street Church , Abiel himself had delivered the introductory prayer . I t was too soon for Abiel Holmes to see that the real significance of the Unitarian movement was social , not theological ; that it had far more to do with the Rights of Man than with the denial of the Trinity . A dissenter himself , Abiel had not as yet the dissenter 's fierce opposition to all who disagreed with him . He was forty-one ; he was still growing . He looked forward , not back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other temptations that beset a man of God ? the Devil walked always behind one . The fascination of compiling the Annals grew daily , hourly . Abiel told himself he must beware of neglecting his spiritual , pastoral duties in favor of history . The Sunday School had eighty members , the new library was receiving books too fast to house them . A man 's sermons could be used twice and thrice ; Abiel exchanged pulpits with many churches in and around Boston ; in particular his sermon on the death of George Washington was often asked for . Abiel kept the church records in his own hand , he would not have trusted them to another . 1809 . June , July . Leaving his study with reluctance , Abiel walked downstairs and across the road to his Meetinghouse . And as always when Ile set foot . in God 's house , his heart lifted instantly . Of the modest house of God that was his own particular care , Abiel loved every foot . The slim spire with its graceful belfry topped by the big gilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of square white pews , the tall windows that let in the morning sun . Of course , there were things that could be improved . The pew seats , for instance , raised on hinges to give standing room during prayer . After the long Prayer they were released , and came clown with a bang that was not conducive to worship . Sally did not like the choir and the music . She wanted an organ . There was nothing sinful in a church organ , she said , and besides , the bass viol was always out of tune and the strings broke regularly on Sabbath evening as if by design of Satan . I3ass viol and flute , Ablel had replied , were music enough in God 's house . But afterwards , he visited half the churches in Boston to examine the organs and inquire as to the cost of installation . From the doorsill of his Meetinghouse , Abiel Holmes looked out on Cambridge Common where a seventeen-starred flag hung now front the staff and the Revolutionary cannon sat fat and cocky , not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green with summer , good to take one 's spade behind the house and dig in the vegetable garden . The months passed , and in his almanac Aidel made occasional notes of meetings and appointments , addling little that was personal . But on August ' 29 , 1809 , Abiel broke his rule . Alongside the date and the printed prediction that the day would be " pleasant , " he added a little mark :  - -  - I'leasant tagto. , / : 10 t'onunetteement , Cambridge College . = - - sun 1 ) . Then he threw black sand on the ink to blot it . son b . " Thus modestly was announced the advent of Oliver Wendell Holmes , doctor , pro . fessor , Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table ? and poet laureate to Boston for half a century . 4 1815 . A boy growing up in a quiet college town , Not even a town ? a village of tree-lined lanes , of open fields where raspberries grew wild , of salt marshes where the tide rose and fell and where the heron built its nest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aged five , heard the bells peal for victory and ran all the way some from dame school , waving his hat with the other boys and shouting , " Hurrah for America ! " The hurricane came that September , blowing fiercely in from the sea , leaving salt crystals on Cambridge windows . Oliver 's grandfather , driving out from Boston next day , said most of the beautiful English elms that Mr. Paddock had planted near the Common were lying in the street , blown clown . The American elms stood up because they were more slender and yielding . It was like the willows and oaks in the fable . Well , it was always good when something American stood up and something English fell down . Oliver 's father insisted the British were no longer our enemies and it was a Christian 's business to foster peace , not strife . But in the attic hung an old flintlock musket that had belonged to Oliver 's grandfather , Captain Holmes . Abiel told his son that when he was ten he could have it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of battle , the words of peace spoken by his father were to the boy entirely unconvincing . Oliver spent a lot of time in church . On Sunday there were three services ; the long one was held in the afternoon . Until Oliver was six , Harvard College held all its services , including morning chapel , in the Meetinghouse ; the students sat upstairs in the east gallery . When University Hall was built the students stopped coming to the Meetinghouse except for Commencement exercises . And Commencement , as every Cambridge boy knew , transformed the Meetinghouse and the whole town into a place of carnival and delight . The Common was covered with tents made , in thrifty Yankee fashion , of old sails . Candy booths , Punch and Judy shows , lined the sidewalks round the Square . On Monday morning the men began putting up the tents and kept at it all night ; you could hear their hammers plainly from your bed . Every August , Oliver counted the tents , telling his brother triumphantly there were many more this year than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Meet inghouse , you heard first of all the Lighthorse earning with their trumpets . That was the Governor , arriving to take his scat in the Meetinghouse . By nine o'clock every pew was filled . The Harvard Washington Corps was gorgeous with cockaded hats , tall polished boots , and clanking swords . And how grand the Honorable George Cabot looked , descending from his carriage in black breeches and silk stockings , wig and buckled shoes ! h e scholars themselves were almost eclipsed in all this festivity . About fifty were graduated each rear ; they clashed about among the crowd in the August sun , their gowns floating behind them , their tau beaver hats looking hot and magnificent . Oliver Holmes knew each of them by name . With every Cambridge boy it was a point of pride to know the list of every class alphabetically from Amory to Wentworth , and not only the names but the nicknames , their owners ' haunts and favorite panics . Oliver looked forward to that day when he himself would thus be listed and could tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cronies had been over to Gallagher 's last night , for beer and oysters . On Sundays , Abiel Holmes often exchanged pulpits with ministers in and around Boston . As Oliver grew older , his father began inviting the boy to come along to Dorchester or Lexington to hear him preach . The two would jog off together in the two-wheeled chaise behind a quiet horse , and the boy loved it . They would leave on Saturday and come home on Monday . Abiel , on these trips , talked religion to his son . Oliver listened vaguely . By the time he was ten the Westminster Catechism had lost its bite not only for Oliver Holmes but for most of New England . Oliver was still afraid of the Devil , but the doctrine of transmitted sin , justification , sanctification , meant no more to him than the mystic syllables by which his friends counted each other out in their games . But to Abiel Holmes the old doctrines had become more important than ever . It seemed to him that New England was rushing toward Unitarianism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant God as One rather than God as Three in One . As long as the movement had been confined to theology , Abiel had paid little heed . Any good historian knew such quarrels were forgot ten in a generation and the true doctrine prevailed . 13ut Unitarianism had obviously gone far beyond doctrinal matters . The old morality was disappearing with the old religion . Abiel , who had cautioned his congregation against singing Watts hymns with levity , saw crowds go to church gayly , in their best bonnets , as if they were going to a show . Pipe organs and mummery took the place of solemnity and the Long Prayer ; if men still loved God , they most certainly did not fear Him . And fear of the Lord , Abiel told himself passionately , was the beginning of wisdom . The truth was that the Unitarian movement was a natural concomitant to events that were not churchly but sociological ; not local but nation-wide . The Jeffersonian ideal of individualism , opportunity for all , refused to jibe with the notion that man was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter what one 's politics , the ideas of Jefferson and of Rousseau before him had penetrated too far to be revoked . The Rights of Man ? was this consistent with a doctrine of total depravity and everlasting damnation ? if you could get ahead on earth , said Yankee common sense , you could get ahead in heaven . And to this notion the new applied science was a potent ally . A man who had seen his mother die of the smallpox , and who now saw his son saved by vaccination , could no longer believe that prayer was the only salvation against , present danger . Lavoisier had said that matter was indestructible ; even smoke was but another form of the wood it rose from . John Dalton advanced his atomic theory . Down in Monticello , Thomas Jefferson was experimenting with the rotation of crops , using the calculus as well as common sense on his farm , and at , the same time planning a university that was to embrace all creeds . With every step that science took , Abiel was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether it was a mere tally of the number of spindles in Baltimore 's cotton factories in 1813 or the incorporation , in 1811 , of the Alassachusetts General Hospital in Boston . 1311t to the new spirit that Well ( along with science ? the new agnosticism , Unitarianism , whatever name men called it by ? Abiel was deeply opposed . When a man invented a cotton loom , a water-driven spindle , let him dedicate it to the glory of God ! Let him go down on his knees and thank the Father who had put this invention into the mind of His humble servant . Life was becoming easy , conditions of daily living much softer . And man , Abiel Holmes observed , no longer feared his Maker . His house warmed by stoves , man looked out at the raging blizzard and smiled , forgetting to propitiate his God . Abiel ceased exchanging pulpits with such men as William Ellery Charming . On Sundays the Meetinghouse saw no more Unitarians . It was good , thought Abiel , that he had long ago entered his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Academy was a very bulwark of Orthodoxy . Par-Imps Oliver would go to Andover Theological Seminary and be a minister . 5 OLIVER HOLMES did nothing of the kind . When he was fifteen he went for a winter to Phillips Academy , sailing pleasantly through the semesters without being marked even slightly by moral or religious suasion ; the virus of Orthodoxy did not touch him . In October , 1825 , he found himself a Harvard freshman ? and very pleased with the fact . He was sixteen , quite sure he was a man , but he still lived at home in his old room facing west under the eaves . Every morning he rose in the dark at the clanging of the college bell and ran across a brown , grassy field to chapel . John Kirkland was still president of Harvard , Josiah Quincy was mayor of Boston , John Quincy Adams was president of the United States . Missouri was a state , come in after Maine .

Along its banks the drivers walked , their lines slackening across narrow water : " I got a mule and her name is Sal , fifteen miles on the Erie Canal . " 1825 The ceremony of breaking ground for the continuation of the great national road westward of the Ohio was performed at St. Clairsville on the 4th of July . ?

Mr. Whitney , at the instance of the government of the United States , next directed his mechanical ingenuity to the manufacture of fire arms , in which he was eminently successful ; . . . and his death . . . was regarded as a public calamity . " How the face of America was changing ! thought Abiel Holmes . In Cambridge lanes the college boys teetered about on huge , high-wheeled velocipedes . There was gaslight on the streets of Boston .

He would write his last paragraph on the same desk , looking out on almost the same Cambridge landscape he had looked out on a quarter century ago when the Annals were begun . Preparing to compose his peroration , Abiel turned back to the old edition of 1805 : ? A NEW WORLD has been discovered , which has been receiving inhabitants from the old , more than three hundred years . A new empire has arisen . . . . Once more Abiel Holmes felt a stirring of his blood . When he wrote those words , America embraced sixteen states , five million people . Now it had twenty-four states , ten million inhabitants . Searching his original Preface , searching also his first pages of actual history , Abiel was startled to find no mention of God , no credit given duly to the Heavenly Father of all these Americans , the Good Shepherd without whose help no flock could cross the western mountains , no ship arrive in harbors west or east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had forgotten , in his country , his God .

He read again the sentence by General Washington which he quoted then and would quote now ? a sentence he had often used in sermons : " No people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the invisible hand , which conducts the affairs of men , more than the people of the United States . Every step , by which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation , seems to have been distinguished by some token of providential agency . " Then , with a rolling phrase , a succession of capital letters , Abiel wrote the last words of his book : Following his own valedictory counsel , and favoured with the benediction of Heaven , may the Republic be preserved through all the revolving years of future Time . 6 ABIEL missed the Annals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interest and a hobby : they had been a solace , a refuge from very present trouble . And as the months passed , Abiel needed a refuge and a solace . In 1827 the First Parish became involved in a very serious controversy . It concerned Abiel 's refusal to accept the new Unitarian doctrines which in the last years had become so popular . The more popular they became , the more Abiel turned away his face . On exchange Sundays his congregation was greeted by no more Channings in the pulpit , but only with the strictest Congregationalists , men with the old-fashioned hell fire in their sermons . And the congregation did not like it . They said so , and when Abiel would not listen they held meetings , made impassioned speeches , and finally , after months of wrangling , dispatched a letter to Abiel , signed by many ? but not all  --  the leading men of the parish . The letter was long and polite , oiled with the very unction of piety . But it said in effect that if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his flock desired another shepherd . Abiel read the letter and did not yield an inch . Thirty-five years ago he had come to this parish to teach certain doctrines . The doctrines had not changed . Abiel saw no authority in this parish to change them . Sally Holmes stood staunchly by her husband . Liberal-minded herself , reared in liberal surroundings , she had never , during all the years of her marriage , been able to espouse the old religion . She was both too practical and too cheerful to accept a doctrine that sent her children to hell before they had learned to speak . She had never said so ; there had been no occasion to say so . Her husband was the kindest of men ; never once had she seen him strike fear to his children 's hearts by any doctrine whatever . But as he grew older , Sally had watched him sadly . Whether right or wrong , Abiel , plainly , was going to lose his church . How easy it would be for him to escape this bitter cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they could go on happily as before , with the whole parish sustaining them . But Abiel would not twist his words . The battle , he said , was not his but the Lord 's . Yet his voice , when he rebuked his flock , was neither bitter nor denunciatory . It was firm , but as always it was gentle . Leaning a little forward , his long , fine hands ' resting on the arms of the pulpit , he spoke quietly , his face serene , benign . Strife was not fitting in God 's house . The congregation , glancing at each other , stirred restlessly . Their pastor was out of line with the times . Did he not understand what was going on around him ? The older church members supported him staunchly , but to the younger , Abiel 's gentleness irritated more than if he had screamed back . " If I seem to disregard the wishes or the taste of my hearers , " he wrote to some of his parishioners , " it is because I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The congregation , angry , desired to be saved in its own way . More meetings were held and on June 18 , 1829 , it was voted that " the Rev. Dr. Abiel Holmes be , and he hereby is , dismissed from his office of minister of the gospel and teacher of piety , religion and morality in said parish , and that all connexion between said Holmes , as such minister or teacher , and said parish , do and shall henceforth cease . " On Sabbath evening , Abiel heard that another preacher would be there before him . It was the end ; Abiel left the First Church . He did not go out alone . Sixty of the members went with him ; it , was the parish at large , the noncommunicants , who had opposed him . Abiel and his flock held service in the old Courthouse on the Square . They had hopes some day of building a new Meetinghouse . But no new church , Sally Holmes knew , could take the place in her husband 's heart of the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 OLIVER HOLMES , a senior now at Harvard , was sorry for his father . But he was young and extremely occupied with his own affairs . He was Class Poet , he was vaguely in love with a different girl each week ; graduation was only two months away and he had not the slightest idea what he was going to do after he had received his diploma . Everyone else in the class of ' 20 , it seemed to him , had settled upon a career . Sam Smith was going to Andover Theological Seminary ; Ben Peirce was going to teach mathematics , Curtis and Bigelow were going to the Law School under Judge Story . The last thing Oliver desired was to be a minister , and the next last thing , a mathematician . There was not , in truth , much choice of careers . He had written successfully for the college papers ; Ile would like to be an author ? but how could a man keep alive on a few poems and stories ? In the end he settled on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law courses at Dane Hall , and spent a hideous winter brooding over Blackstone and Kent . By January he was in despair . " I am sick at heart of this place , " he wrote a school friend of Andover days . " I know not what the temple of the law may be to those who have entered it , but to me it seems very cold and cheerless about the threshold . " Spring came , and instead of writing law Oliver sat by the window looking out on a green world , and wrote poetry . How easily the verses came , pouring out upon the paper , quips and puns , conceits and figures ! " I spend my time , " he wrote his friend , " writing poetry like a madman , and talking sentiment like a turtle dove . " Cambridge had the most delightful girls , and lately Oliver had made excursions into Boston too . There was one girl in particular who seemed quite perfect , Miss Amelia Jackson of Bedford Place . She was almost as small as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and she said she loved to listen to him talk . Her father was Judge Jackson and her uncle was Dr. Lines Jackson , who taught physics at the Aledica I School ? the most fascinating man , Oliver was sure , that he had ever met . Miss Jackson liked poetry , Oliver soon discovered , especially the poetry of 0 . W. Holmes . Oliver wrote more verses than ever , covering the backs ofhis old law papers with lines evenly matched . In September of 1830 he conceived a poem that had nothing to do with love , purple shadows , or Miss Amelia Jackson . It had to do with an old , worn-out ship , but it came from the heart all the same and was written furiously , in anger and indignation , The frigate Constitution , ? Old Ironsides , ? whose victorious return to harbor Boston had once greeted with such wild joy , lay now rotting at the wharf . The government announced suddenly , tersely , that tine vessel was taking up too much room and must be scrapped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no result . Abiel Holmes was almost ill over it ; Oliver , bursting into the door one afternoon late , found him sitting moodily at his desk , trying to compose a letter to the Boston Daily Advertiser . Now that the second edition of the Annals was in print , what weapon , said Abiel Holmes , had he against such outrage ? Oliver went upstairs and , sitting down by the western window , got out pen and paper . The lines poured from him , swept from him in a tide . It was as though he were writing someone else 's poem , dictated carefully by its author and transcribed by Oliver Holmes :  - -  There were three stanzas . Oliver copied them , finding very little to change . It was late when he took the poem downstairs . His father was still at his desk ; Saurin 's Sermons lay open before him . Silently , Oliver laid his poem on the desk and left the room . A moment later his father called him . When Oliver came in , Abiel Holmes was standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He began to speak , and his voice choked . With enormous surprise and a great lift of the heart , Oliver , looking up , saw ( elm in his father 's eyes , saw that the hand holding his verses was trembling . The poem , published next clay in the Advertiser , swept Boston like wildfire , then reached beyond Boston all over the country . Printed in broadsides , the verses were sold on the streets of Washington . The government , overwhelmed , gave orders that the frigate C on stilu i on be preserved . In Boston a shout of triumph went up . And in Boston , Cambridge , and far beyond the river Charles , Oliver Wendell Holmes , son of the Reverend Dr. Abiel Holmes of Holmes Place , was famous . 8 SUDDEN fame did not determine Oliver Holmes , at twenty-one , to be a poet by profession . The conditions of being the first American gentleman of letters were as baffling as ever ; " Old Ironsides " brought fame but not money . Moreover the whole episode , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody had heard of him ; on Thursday night , lie was celebrated . By Friday week , Oliver told himself , he would be forgotten . For all his frivol i t y there was a practical Yankee streak in this young man . What success did for Oliver Holmes was to give him courage to abandon the law . There had been no doubt in his mind that he hated the law , from Blackstone to Kent . But with no alternative in mind it would have been impossible to go to his father and announce he was dropping the law because the law was disagreeable . His talks with Dr. Jackson , Oliver found increasingly fascinating ; lately he had been looking into medical books and seeking out his brother-in-law , Dr. Parsons , to answer his questions . Here , in medicine , was a profession that concerned MAN . Here was a way to earn money and study mankind at the same time , To Oliver , Dr. Jackson was the wisest man he knew . He would ask Dr. Jackson now ? tomorrow ? if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Jackson said yes , he would go to his father that night and be done with the law forever . To Abiel Holmes , his son 's decision did not come as a great surprise ; Abiel was aware the boy had been wasting his time at the law . If Oliver wished to study medicine , then let him begin immediately , and let him apply himself with more diligence than heretofore . " You are twenty-one , " Abiel told his son gravely . " You have had many advantages of education and background . At your age I had my own parish in Georgia . " There was more of the same . Oliver , standing on one foot and then the other , listened automatically . how often during his lifetime he had heard about these " advantages . " But this time his father was justified and Oliver knew it he had thrown away a whole year at the law . Oliver went into Boston and found a boardinghouse ? it was at 2 Central Court ? and flung himself into medicine , certain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson 's lectures fulfilled his every hope and expectation . But when the young student went down to the hospital and saw the white faces of the sick , row upon row in the long corridors , he was horrified . That night gray faces , wasted limbs , pursued his dreams . It . was worse a few days later when he walked into the operating theater for the first time , notebook in hand . Dr. Bigelow stood there , a saw in his hand . his old black suit was splashed with the blood of a score of operations ; beneath him on the table a man , made mercifully half-drunk with whiskey , screamed while Oliver 's friends of the medical class held him clown . Even the skeleton that hung over the table in the students ' room made Oliver wince . All day and for many days when he should have been memorizing the names of bones , he found himself moralizing upon the mortality of man . At home he was quiet , disposed to seek out his father and start conversations on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abiel was astonished . He did not know that his son had witnessed , that morning at the lying-in ward , a young mother die in the agonies of childbed fever . " I knew Oliver was clever , " Abiel told his wife that night in their room . " I knew he was talented , too . But lie never gave evidence , before , that he could think on spiritual subjects . " I must announce to you the startling position that I have been a medical student for more than six months , and am sitting with Wistar 's Anatomy beneath my quiescent arm , with a stethoscope on my desk , and the blood-stained implements of my ungracious profession around me . I do not know what you will say , ? but I can not help it . . . . I know I might have made an indifferent lawyer , ? I think I may make a tolerable physician , ? I did not like the one , and I do like the other . And so you must know that for the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston , attending medical lectures , going to the Massachusetts Hospital , and slicing and slivering the carcasses of better men and women than I ever was myself or am like to be . It is a sin for a puny little fellow like me to mutilate one of your six-foot men as if he was a sheep , ? hut live la science ( I must write a Mere and call it records of the dissecting-room , so let me save all my pretty things , as plums for my pudding . If you would ( lie fagged to death like a crow with the king birds after him , ? be a school-master ; if you would wax than and savage , like a half-fed spider , ? he a lawyer ; if you would go off like an opium eater in love with your starving delusion , ? be a doctor . " I must write a piece . . . let me save all my pretty things , as plums for my pudding . " Oliver Holmes was finding himself . Action was important ; one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of carcasses or the shove that sent a wherry from boat-slip to river . But what really mattered was to remember the slicing , remember the glint on the river beyond the bridge 's shadow . Not to remember dimly , as a vague , completed pleasure . The act of memory must be one with the experience itself . While the thing was happening , Oliver experienced it with a joyful , painful vividness , phrase by phrase as it were , dimly conscious that later , when pen in hand he called upon these phrases , they would come back . It was a kind of double living , the success of which could be proved only by Oliver 's readers . Strangers , reading what he wrote , must feel as Oliver had felt . If they did not so feel , then Oliver knew that he had failed , and his own experience turned to ashes within him . There was in this no shred of altruism ; Oliver Holmes had no desire to give , boat trips to the poor of Boston or to the rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's necessity to record and thus to fix forever ? shake off forever ? the impressions that crowded so mercilessly , demanding release . Around the supper table at 2 Central Court , Oliver observed his fellow boarders with acutest interest , trying to place them , each in his proper niche . He ended by putting them all into an essay and calling it The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table , ( This was not the real Autocrat that we know today ; it would be twenty-six years before Oliver wrote for the Atlantic Monthly the series that made him famous . This was only the germ , the first beginning of the Autocrat . ) Signing the essay with his initials , Oliver sent it to the New England Magazine . It was published in November . Nobody noticed it . Oliver followed it with one more paper on the same subject and then turned again to medicine . In January , 1833 , Oliver completed his studies under Dr. Jackson . The next step was a foregone conclusion : he must , go abroad and laconic familiar with the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to go was London ; Jackson himself had worked as a " dresser " at St , Thomas 's . Now he recommended Paris . The best physicians in the world , he said , were to be found at La Piti ? and at the Mel Dieu . Oliver sailed for France . For two years he sat at the feet of the great in medicine ? and for every one of them he had a description . Andral the do . ( Flew , 13roussais the old volcano , Iticord whom Oliver called the Voltaire of pelvic literature , Oliver 's hero was Dr. Louis who told his students : ? In November of 1835 , Oliver sailed for home . The Parisian medical world , he said , had taught him three principles of the profession . He listed them : " Not to take authority when I can have facts ; not to ? guess when I can know ; not to think a man must take physic because he is sick . " Before he left Paris , Oliver had been able to procure one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Jackson kept up with the times . In his stateroom Oliver unwrapped the instrument , fingering it lovingly . If he could manage to slant the pipe a trifle , the eye would not water looking down . When be got home he would rig up an arrangement by which a candle could be fastened to the platform , throwing light onto the slide . The trip from Le Havre to New York took forty-three ( lays ; it was December when Oliver reached Cambridge . Snow had fallen . How white and deep it was , and how quiet the lanes of Cambridge after the noisy cobblestones of Parish His mother looked well and as brisk as ever , but when he saw his father , Oliver was shocked . Why , his father was an old man , white-haired , frail . His hickory cane stood always by the door ; walking down the icy path to the gate , he leaned heavily on it . Oliver , watching , saw him stop to speak to a child , reach a mittened hand in the pocket . of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oliver could remember , his father had carried candy to give to children . : Bill . this Lino it was an old man 's gesture , Tears scalded Oliver 's eyes .
