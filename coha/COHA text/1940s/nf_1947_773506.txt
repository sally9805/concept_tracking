txt // While the O'Rielly men might suffer temporary setbacks , they never lost their lead so far as the over-all project was concerned . March found them in Nashville with Shaffner trailing ; June found them setting the last posts to New Orleans with promises of wire to follow , while Amos Kendall 's subcontractor on the southernmost section had done nothing . The early success of the O'Rielly forces , unfortunately , was more apparent than real ; serious troubles were beginning to make themselves felt . Their advance in the future was to be less rapid . 6 MONEY difficulties were O'Rielly 's chief obstacle . With hundreds of miles of wire yet to be strung his forces found themselves with no funds . Furthermore , O'Rielly had told the merchants of New Orleans and of other commercial centers along the route that no assistance would be asked of them until the line was operating successfully . Nor did they care to assist while the legality and practicability of the Columbian telegraph remained uncertain . Along the extent of the route public sympathy was with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile O'Rielly , trying to carry the line alone , had fallen into serious financial straits.29 Up to the time that he reached Louisville in the autumn of 1847 , O'Rielly 's building program had been sound . Plans for both the Atlantic &; Ohio and the Pittsburgh , Cincinnati Sc Louisville lines had been carefully made and intelligently carried out . It looked as if O'Rielly had laid the foundations of a handsome fortune . Then reason was sacrificed to impulse . Stung into hasty action by the efforts of the Morse patentees to void his contract , he determined to occupy the territory in question as rapidly as possible and thereby forestall any patentee attempt to do so . Nor was his effort to be purely defensive . He would " carry the war into Africa , " O'Rielly lines would be strung beside patentee lines as rapidly as he could make the necessary arrangements . Just how they were to be financed or how profitable they might prove were secondary considerations . Lines were projected in all directions with reckless abandon . At the time // that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Rielly was also constructing the Ohio , Indiana &; Illinois , the Illinois &; Mississippi , and the St. Louis &; Fort Leavenworth lines . Moreover , plans were being formulated for an invasion of the East . While his telegraph organization was in this greatly overexpanded condition , O'Rielly was caught in the financial disruption which followed the Mexican War . The agents established at key centers to handle O'Rielly 's affairs ? James Ward at Cincinnati , Richard Woolfolk at Louisville , Sanford J. Smith at St. Louis , and Charles Doane at New Orleans ? worked feverishly to meet maturing drafts.30 Sanford J. Smith wrote O'Rielly on April 4 , 1848 , that the preceding week had been more trying to him than any other time since he had become involved in telegraph matters . Business and financial failures on every hand had produced a panic in all the western cities , and it was next to impossible to raise money at any price . Ward had written Smith from Cincinnati in great distress saying he could not raise a dollar there to meet the payments coming due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discounted at any rate . Smith had devised ways and means to ease him . Then came Woolfolk with the same story ? drafts on him and no way to meet them . Smith also gave him assistance . At this point the hard-pressed St. Louis agent had to look after his own affairs . " Thank God , " he declared , " I believe I have passed the crisis without anyone knowing but what I had my pockets full of rocks . " In conclusion he urged O'Rielly to press matters in New Orleans and raise every dollar he could and " not be satisfied with their good wishes as that will not pay debts or build lines . " 31 Anxious appeals to the group in Rochester that had first financed O'Rielly brought assurances of a willingness to help but a complete inability to do so . Money was as tight in the Genessee Valley as in other sections of the country . Even Elisha D. Ely , the wealthiest member of the original Atlantic , Lake &; Mississippi organization , was unable to meet a draft for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drafts began " to go protest " for nonpayment . There was scarcely a community along the route where the O'Rielly forces did not owe money . Under these trying circumstances the promoter turned to Joshua // Hanna of the Pittsburgh banking house of Hussey 8c Hanna with a request that the banker take over supervision of the entire enterprise until conditions were stabilized . " Hanna , with his business associate , John I. Roggen , countered with the suggestion that a three man committee composed of Roggen , Sanford Smith , and himself , be set up to take complete charge of O'Rielly 's financial affairs . Were it not that neighbors and friends had purchased stock and made loans upon his recommendations , Hanna assured O'Rielly that he would never entertain the idea . As it was he felt obligated to protect their interests , and he agreed , therefore , to give the matter his attention despite the constant protestations of his partners that he was devoting too much time to the telegraph . " Altogether , " he concluded his lengthy letter , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begging , some scolding and some threatening . Things have come to a crisis . Something must be done or Fog Smith and Kendall will triumph over you yet . " 34 On July 8 , 1848 , in accordance with Hanna 's suggestion , O'Rielly made Joshua Hanna , Sanford Smith , and John I. Roggen his trustees with full power of attorney and right of substitution . The management of all his telegraph interests were turned over to them with the understanding that they would employ all available resources to liquidate his liabilities . " The trustees set to work at once to bring financial order out of the chaos . O'Rielly was told that under no circumstances was new work to be commenced . " To forestall a number of law suits which threatened , arrangements were made to pay creditors on a pro rata basis as funds became available.37 The entire O'Rielly program was to be treated as a unit . Resources and materials were to be pooled and apportioned to various lines under construe tion on a strictly business basis . Those lines most nearly completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so heavy and his credit so badly strained , that the stabilizing measures of Hanna and his associates could have proved successful only if no further complications had arisen . But the attempt to save the enterprise came too late . ' 1 ' he ) , // committee had scarcely undertaken its work when a fatal blow fell upon the already tottering O'Rielly structure , and specifically upon the ill-starred People 's line . On September 11 , 1848 , an injunction against the Columbian telegraph was granted to Amos Kendall.39 KENDALL had planned his campaign well . He knew that he was no match for O'Rielly in the field . It would have been an uphill fight to turn public support away from the affable Irishman whose efforts throughout his lifetime had been enlisted in the interests of the people . With Kendall 's knowledge of government and his legal training , he realized that his approach could be made most effectively through the state legislatures and the courts of law.40 Accordingly , special acts of incorporation were obtained for the New Orleans 8c Ohio Telegraph Company in Tennessee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Louisiana passed protective legislation and gave the company the right of eminent domain . More subtle was the legislation put through the Tennessee Assembly on January 14 , 1848 , as a rider to a bill which bore the innocuous title : " An Act to authorize William Hickson of the County of Bledsoe to open a Turnpike Road and for other purposes . " 43 Innocent enough on its face , the last sections of the act provided that the owners of any system of telegraphing should have the same right of way in the state as had previously been conferred upon the New Orleans 8c Ohio Telegraph Company provided such system did not conflict with any private right // secured by government patent . Persons desiring to avail themselves of the privilege were to submit an accurate description of the system under which they proposed to operate to the Board of Internal Improvements . Only after approval by that body would they be allowed to proceed . This clever stratagem raised a bitter outcry from O'Rielly who branded the legislation a mere artifice to establish indirectly what never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Much more devastating was Kendall 's attack in the circuit court of Kentucky . Shortly after the Louisville-Nashville section of the People 's line had been put into operation , Kendall had brought action against the Columbian telegraph as an infringement of the Morse patents . He contended that the Columbian instrument which had been hastily devised by two telegraphic handy-men , Edmund F. Barnes and Samuel K. Zook , was a mere modification of Morse 's . On September 11 , 1848 , the circuit court upheld his contention and ruled that the instrument could no longer be used within the district of Kentucky . " The action could not have come at a more unfortunate time for O'Rielly . His financial affairs had reached a crisis the previous July , and the committee composed of Hanna , Roggen , and Smith was fighting desperately to keep him from bankruptcy . Even without the injunction it was doubtful whether they could have succeeded ; with it , the outlook for O'Rielly was almost hopeless . " The result of the Frankfort suit had prostrated all our expectations , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the South say there is no hope of assistance there . No capitalist will embark where risk or litigation is to follow . I have called our true and only reliable friends together for consultation . " 45 From the South , Charles Doane , agent at New Orleans , reported that the public considered them and their line " used up , " and those who had taken a little stock were alarmed , fearing the loss of their investments . " I am looked upon as a visionary fool , " he wrote , " who has embarked his all in a precarious speculation . . . and even looked upon in the way of credit with all suspicion ? In truth I am literally floored and can not get on without assistance . " " // After recovering somewhat from this blow which momentarily paralyzed their efforts , O'Rielly 's associates determined to fight the action . That section of the line which had been completed was to be kept open , not alone for the income , but for its effect on company morale and public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Observing the letter but nullifying the spirit of the law , Edmund F. Barnes in the Louisville office put aside the register which was said to infringe Morse and began receiving messages from Nashville by sound . Within a month he was cited for contempt in violating the injunction and made to execute bond to Kendall.47 Immediately after the proceedings against Barnes had halted him another device was contrived . The People 's line was extended from Louisville across the river to Jeffersonville , Indiana , which was not within the scope of the injunction order . From this point the line began to operate once more . Although messages were no longer to be transmitted from Louisville , the company maintained an office in that city where communications for transmission were collected and transferred by regular carriers to Jeffersonville . This attempt was no more successful . Once more the court intervened , and this time there was a finality about the proceedings . On November 15 the marshal was ordered to seize as much of the People 's line as might be necessary to prevent its further operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way to extricate the line , O'Rielly and his associates were obliged to suspend its operation . THE fate of the People 's Telegraph was of vital concern to those member companies of O'Rielly 's original Atlantic , Lake &; Mississippi system which formed the seaboard-St . Louis connection , notably the Atlantic &; Ohio , the Pittsburgh , Cincinnati Sc Louisville , and the Ohio &; Mississippi lines . They , too , were at war with the Morse patent interest and they looked to their southern ally to provide the important connection with New Orleans . With the paralysis of the important Louisville-Nashville section of that line by the injunction against the use of the Columbian instrument , Joshua Hanna came for- // ward with a plan for overcoming the difficulty . He suggested that the leaders of the Atlantic 8c Ohio and the Pittsburgh , Cincinnati 8c Louisville free themselves of dependence upon the Morse patents by undertaking , as a personal venture , the purchase of the House printing telegraph patent not only for the New Orleans line but for all the lines comprising the O'Rielly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the O'Rielly lines , and the stock and accrued dividends reserved for the Morse patentees on the original lines , in accordance with the terms of the O'Rielly contract , could be apportioned among those who joined with Hanna in the House purchase.49 It sounded like a good speculation , but the plan never materialized . Whether satisfactory arrangements could not be made with the holders of the House patent ( Samuel L. Selden , Henry R. Selden , and Hugh Downing ) , whether the House machine was itself adjudged inferior , or whether capitalists found the risk too great can not be ascertained . The fact remains that after heated discussion of the subject for several months the plan was dropped . Meanwhile O'Rielly , casting about for a means of liberating his line , had become convinced of the superiority of a new electrochemical telegraph which had been brought to this country in 1848 by its inventor , Alexander Bain , a Scotch scientist . Bain 's telegraph , which had been patented in England a year and a half before , was in many respects similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished by a key similar to that of Morse ; to get around any objection of patent infringement , Bain substituted for the key a perforated paper ribbon through the holes of which electric impulses intermittently flowed . In the receiving device the electric . // current , acting through a fixed metal stylus , produced a series of blue marks upon a paper ribbon by decomposition of the potassium prussiate with which the ribbon had been treated . Bain 's apparatus also employed a relay magnet and an alphabet of signs similar to Morse's.50 The new telegraph had many features to commend it to the industry . Its operation was simple and rapid . It was said to be twice as fast as House 's , three times as fast as Morse 's , and eight times as fast as the needle telegraph of Cooke and Wheatstone . It was capable of sending to greater distances without the aid of relays and with a smaller battery than any of its rivals . On the other hand , there were certain disadvantages to the Bain machine . It was frequently troubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribbon were unhealthy ; and the fine spiral lines made by the receiving apparatus upon the paper were hard for the operator to read and a strain upon his eyes . In spite of its shortcomings , O'Rielly had grown increasingly enthusiastic about the Bain apparatus with each passing week . By the autumn of 1848 he was predicting that its introduction would bring about as great a revolution in telegraphing as steam had done in connection with the printing press.52 On the strength of glowing reports , arrangements were made by O'Rielly and his associates for the American rights to the Bain machine ; and O'Rielly undertook to assist the inventor in getting the necessary patents for its use in this country . " All will go well no matter what troubles we may now meet , " he wrote to Hanna on the eve of the purchase of the Bain patents in October 1848 . Although his affairs were in confusion , and he was on the verge of bankruptcy , he naively concluded , " I tell you I see the way of making more out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of good cheer , my friend . . . I never felt in better courage . " Once the Bain instrument was in operation on the People 's line , predicted O'Rielly , he would bid defiance to the Morse or any other system of telegraphing.53 While there was general discussion of the relative merits of the I louse , Morse , and Bain instruments at this time , a number of farseeing leaders warned that there could be no peace and little pros- // perity in the industry until the three rival systems were combined . Negotiations , with this end in view , were set in motion by the representatives of the Atlantic , Lake &; Mississippi Telegraph . Henry R. Selden , president of that organization , presented definite proposals to O'Rielly . " Now is the time for all concerned to make an arrangement which will benefit all and put the telegraph business on a footing that will insure its usefullness sic and render it profitable and pleasant to those concerned in its management , " he wrote . " As long as the rival systems are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Can they not now all be combined ? " Selden suggested that 50 percent of the stock of all lines be divided equally among the proprietors of the three rival systems in full payment for their patent rights . The Morse , House , and Bain interests could make more through their joint efforts , he contended , than any one group could possibly make through independent action.54 Selden had put his finger on a major telegraphic ill , and many concurred in his views ; yet attempts to harmonize the rival systems in the fall of 1848 failed . Personal ambition , suspicion , and greed precluded all possibility of a union of interests at this time . While it was clear that competition would have to give way to cooperation if the industry was to prosper , the effort was premature . 9 - .. - ALTHOUGH the seizure of its vital Louisville-Nashville section crippled the People 's Telegraph , that organization continued to struggle along . As rapidly as funds could be obtained the line was pushed southward toward New Orleans . But so long as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to get . Such meager help as was obtained came in part from subscriptions for the northern line ( Illinois &; Mississippi ) , and in part from O'Rielly 's personal funds and those of his friends . The whole line was finished in January 1849 , but with the Kentucky section still in the hands of the marshal , it could not operate over the full extent of the route.J6 Even had this section been free , it is questionable whether the line could have been made to work // throughout its length . Its construction had been too hasty and it was too cheaply done to insure any degree of efficient service . Over great sections of Mississippi there were no poles at all ; the wire was borne by brackets nailed to trees . Insulation , likewise , left much to be desired . Instead of being made of glass , the insulators were of glazed earthenware , imperfectly vitrified . The wire soon sawed its way through the thin outer crust of the insulators , leaving the soft pottery cores exposed to the rain which readily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in the warmest weather , the insulators became receptacles of moisture , and virtually worthless . " The public soon formed a bad opinion of the line . Investors refused to buy its stock . Farmers , business men , and the press found the mails more reliable and often quicker than the telegraph . Scarcely a day passed that the operators did not have to turn to the steamboat or the mail service to assist them in transmitting dispatches between New Orleans and Nashville.53 O'Rielly had hoped that the " waybusiness " would pay for the line 's upkeep , while the " through-business " would provide the profits . Conditions being what they were , there was little through-business ? in fact , little of any kind . Receipts were not sufficient to keep the line in repair , let alone pay the operators ' salaries , or retire any of the numerous debts . " The line is a humbug and I fear it will never be much else , " was the hopeless comment of Charles Doane , O'Rielly 's agent at New Orleans . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California to keep it up and pay its debts . The community have all lost confidence in it and I can not wonder . " 59 Meanwhile in Kentucky the inactive Louisville-Nashville section was " going sadly to ruin . " 60 Strenuous efforts were made by O'Rielly to free the line from the injunction order . All possible aid was given Bain in procuring his United States patent , but the procedure was long and tiring . It was March 1849 before the court ruled that Bain was no infringement of Morse , and June before O'Rielly obtained t he release of his line upon his sworn statement that he intended to substitute the Bain for the Columbian telegraph along the route.6 ' 16o ERA OF METHODLESS ENTHUSIASM The deliverance of the Kentucky section of the line from the custody of the court brought satisfaction to O'Rielly but little relief . The line had suffered such great damage while in the possession of the marshal that it actually required more time to repair , or rather to reconstruct it , than had been required to build it originally . Repairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inferior nature of the original construction and the depreciation which had occurred during the paralysis of the Kentucky section . If the People 's Telegraph was to salvage anything , it would have to carry out a comprehensive and costly job of rehabilitation . With an empty treasury and little likelihood of replenishing it , the company 's situation was hopeless.62 Typical of the earnest but futile attempts to get the line into working order was Samuel K. Zook 's account of rehabilitation efforts in Mississippi . Jacob Campbell , foreman of a crew which had been engaged to repair the lines , had progressed only as far as Jackson when he was halted for lack of funds . He asked aid of Zook who , being powerless to help him , had referred the matter to O'Rielly . " Jacob Campbell and party are still in camp here . I managed to get them stuff for a tent which they made up themselves . They have a blanket a piece sic , but no bread nor credit ? They have part of a ham &; some coffee &; sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained them . " In a day or two more , they can begin to practice living on their fat , as they will have nothing to eat . We spent the last money we had in office yesterday repairing the line 35 miles north , where some one had taken a turn in it with a stick &; twisted it off for amusement ... . " There must be some provision made for setting Jacob 's party in motion soon . The requisites are one horse , a camp chest for provi sions , ground auger , and other tools , provisions , more blankets &; money . The past month has been wasted ? utterly thrown away . " " ' Aware of the sacrifice being made by O'Rielly , and influenced I ) y // his indomitable spirit , the operators on the People 's line had displayed patience and forbearance . Month after month ? often with no salaries ? they attempted to keep the fragile line in repair , to adjust complaints of patrons , and to turn aside law suits which threatened . When in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their boarding houses and had no funds to meet their personal needs , unrest developed among them . By summer the disaffection was general . In a letter written to O'Rielly on June 17 , 1849 , M. Jewell and C. Carroll Butler , operators at Jackson , Mississippi , told O'Rielly of their plight ; it might have been the story of almost any operator whether in the main office in Louisville or a remote office in Mississippi . " We have had promises so long , " declared the discouraged operators , " we place no reliance upon them and we conclude we have reached a point where forbearance ceases to be a virtue in consideration of which we submit our designs and intentions to you . " They went on to point out that they had had no money of consequence since the office had been first opened and that what they had received had been used to keep the line in repair . Yet receipts had not been sufficient even to do that . For days at a time the line was out of operation for want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such limited funds that they were not able to do much . Business people had long since lost confidence in the line and as a result its credit was no longer good . Several creditors had already placed their accounts in the hands of lawyers . " As far as we are personally concerned , " warned the operators , " we have put up with all the inconveniences conceivable since connected with the line , and have done it with as good grace as possible under existing circumstances . . . we have been boarding at the only place , on credit , in town . . . and yesterday we had orders to procure another place . " Now in consideration of the above facts and statements , " con ( ! tided the discouraged pair , " we shall , unless our affairs be adjusted , he compelled to close this office and leave town on the first of July , in which case , we shall , of course , take the best measures for the wt t lenient of our matters , and the final security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forced to execute . " 64 . // The enterprise was bankrupt . The telegraph operators began to salvage what they could from their respective offices , and local sheriffs soon held the keys to many of them . Against this background of ruin a sad-faced group convened in Louisville on November 23 , 1849 , to organize the People 's Telegraph Company . Capitalization was fixed at $66o,000 which was to be divided into 13,200 shares of $50 each . Four shares of stock were issued for each $loo subscribed . All of O'Rielly 's prospective stock had , of course , been hypothecated long since to secure the completion of the line , but technically he was the largest stockholder . A glance at the list of principal stockholders will show how completely the People 's Telegraph Company had been the undertaking of O'Rielly and his friends : Henry O'Rielly , 3,000 shares ; Charles Doane , 2,000 shares ; Alexander Bain , 1,98o shares ; John I. Rielly , 600 shares ; Bernard O'Connor , 300 shares ; M. Lefferts , 200 shares ; James W. Ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares. ? As a fitting climax to the luckless venture , the Mississippi burst through the frail levees on the Louisiana shore in the spring of 1850 . Not only was the telegraph wire washed away , but the telegraph office in New Orleans became accessible only by boat . All business was suspended . The penniless proprietors of the company once more congregated in Louisville to determine on a final course of action . Never was an enterprise so apparently broken up and demoralized . A little irregular business on the Louisville-Nashville section alone kept it alive . Just at this time James D. Reid , superintendent of the Atlantic &; Ohio and the Pittsburgh , Cincinnati R Louisville lines , came to Louisville on business . Aware of the value of the New Or leans connection to the lines he served , Reid offered to lease the People 's line for a term of years at an annual rental of $13,500 , or approximately 2 percent on its capitalization of $66o,000 . This proposition was gratefully accepted by the proprietors of the line and a lease was duly executed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the People 's line which had once been O'Rielly 's brightest hope , hut had proved to be the grave of his fortune.00 // KENDALL had succeeded in checking O'Rielly on the Mississippi Valley route to New Orleans , but the victory had been dearly won . The measures taken by Kendall to check the opposition had seriously interfered with the progress of his own New Orleans &; Ohio line . The Morse patentees were regarded by the public as a group of selfish monopolists , while O'Rielly and his associates were the champions of free enterprise . Attempts to raise money for the New Orleans &; Ohio line yielded but meager results . Slowly and painfully the Morse line pushed its way southward , beset by problems on every hand . Even among his own subcontractors Kendall found disaffection and a distressing lack of loyalty . But the story of the New Orleans &; Ohio can best be understood by following the different contractors as they struggled to complete the individual sections . As planned , the easternmost terminus of the New Orleans &; Ohio line was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kendall had organized a separate company , the Western Telegraph , to build from Pittsburgh to Baltimore.He had entrusted the construction of this line to E. D. and E. W. Townsend , along with section one of the New Orleans &; Ohio , which extended the short distance from Pittsburgh southwest to Wheeling . Through misrepresentations in soliciting subscriptions these dishonest contractors not only defrauded Kendall of $18,000 before they deserted him , but also left more than $3,000 of debts along the Western Telegraph route which Kendall was obliged to make good before he could resume operations in this region . " On section two , Eliphalet Cases ? directed his energies to the construction of a line from Wheeling to Cincinnati and Lexington . Work on this section progressed with relative ease and rapidity , but the line was of inferior construction and could not be relied upon . Six months after its completion section two had deteriorated to the place where it was almost worthless.70 Farther south , Taliaferro P. Shaffner and William Tanner had received the contract for section three . Here the race to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kendall and those of O'Rielly hastily threw up parallel lines along the Lexington-Nashville route.71 Due to the acute competition in Kentucky and Tennessee , Shaffner and Tanner frequently had to draw on Kendall for funds . Nevertheless , their section was carried to completion ; and though frequently out of order , it was the most satisfactory of any along the entire New Orleans and Ohio route.72 Section four , extending from Nashville to Waynesboro , Tennessee , had been contracted for by H. M. Watterson . Despite the fact that he had less than one hundred miles of line to erect , Watterson became discouraged by the financial handicaps and took to drinking . When no more than half his task had been completed , he " quit , " already in default to Kendall approximately $2,500.13 Construction on the fifth and last section was the most difficult of all . For three years Kendall tried to close the 65o mile gap which separated Waynesboro from New Orleans . William B. Lloyd and J. J. Haley had been detailed to this section originally , but their efforts had been abortive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Lloyd 's actions brought disfavor on the entire undertaking . They passed from the scene leaving Kendall an inheritance of bad debts and " bad odor. " 74 Kendall 's nephew , John E. Kendall , and T. C. H. Smith took over the building operations on this section , and by January 1851 the New Orleans &; Ohio line was at last completed to New Orleans.75 // In summary , it may be said that of the five contracts entered into by Kendall for building the different sections of the New Orleans and Ohio line , only two were completed in accordance with the terms of the original contracts ; and only one of those ever gave any measure of satisfaction . The subsequent history of the New Orleans R : Ohio is the counterpart of that of the hapless People 's line . In the case of the O'Rielly company , it will be recalled , bankruptcy had forced it to lease its line to more powerful northern neighbors , little more than a year after its completion . The Kendall company had operated no more than three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to creditors in Louisville who reorganized it as the New Orleans &; Ohio Telegraph Lessees.76 Kendall had triumphed over O'Rielly , it is true , but in the heat of battle the victor had come to look much like the vanquished . CHAPTER X O'RIELLY 's announcement in the autumn of 1848 that he would construct a line of telegraph from Boston to New York heralded what might be termed total telegraphic warfare . ' Should he invade the East , there would remain no section of the country that had not served as a battleground for the rival protagonists . Why O'Rielly should have determined on so rash a course at a time when he was already seriously involved in the South , and still building in the West , may be explained largely in the light of his impetuous and vindictive nature . Deeply angered by his treatment at the hands of the Morse patentees , he was quick to seize the opportunity which the Bain patent gave him for a swift invasion of the East . Apart from personal reasons , he believed that a wisely administered opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monopolistic Morse lines along the seaboard . But he was not the first to take to the field . The attack on the Morse companies had been launched the previous year by Hugh Downing , wire manufacturer of Philadelphia and former associate of O'Rielly in his telegraph enterprise . Hugh DOWNING , it may be recalled , had become interested in the telegraph through his manufacture of wire cord for the O'Rielly lines in Pennsylvania . He had played such an active part in the promoter 's early endeavors that he had been made the first president of the Atlantic &; Ohio Telegraph Company , section one of the original Atlantic , Lake &; Mississippi range . In conjunction with O'Rielly and Samuel L. Selden he had purchased the House patent rights for that line on November 16 , 1846 , shortly after the Morse patentees had served formal notice of the abrogation of the O'Rielly contract . // Downing had been carried away by the prevailing enthusiasm for the telegraph enterprise ; convinced that there was " millions in it , " he and Samuel L. Selden had secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . ' ' By the terms of an agreement entered into with Royal E. House , in the fall of 1847 , Downing was allotted the patent rights for the states bordering the Atlantic seaboard with the exception of New York ; and Selden was awarded like privileges for the Empire State , along with an option for the remainder of the country : O'Rielly had declined to share in the purchase . All his available capital was already pledged for the construction of lines in the Nest . Moreover , a practical trial of the House instruments on his Cincinnati-Louisville line a short time previously had proved only moderately successful.s O'Rielly 's lack of enthusiasm for the House apparatus did not cool Downing 's enthusiasm . Proceeding energetically , he organized the New Jersey Magnetic Telegraph Company for the purpose of constructing a line from Philadelphia to New York to serve as unit one of his proposed eastern system. ? The pioneer Morse line , the Magnetic Telegraph Company , which already occupied the route , viewed with concern the progress of the House wire as it made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee . Nor were the reports of the superior construction of the line , and its announced intention of building directly into New York City by means of masts over the Hudson River , calculated to allay the fears of the Morse line which had been obliged to stop short on the Jersey shore several years before.s " The new company have got their line stretched across the Hudson River by means of a 20o foot mast on the Jersey side and one of 350 feet on the opposite shore , " reported the uneasy Magnetic operator at Jersey City to Alfred Vail on March 27 , 1848 . " Expect it will hurt our line considerable sic and some of our operators may be discharged . " 9 A month later Downing 's New Jersey Telegraph // Company ' ? was opened for business , and stood ready to demonstrate its efficiency against the established Morse Company . Both public and press desired to see the House line succeed ; competition , they believed , would have a salutary influence on the somewhat arrogant Morse company . Typical of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two days after the opening of the House line . Speaking of the relative efficiency of the rival systems as demonstrated in a trial transmission of news for the press , the editor wrote : " Saturday settled the question respecting rival telegraph lines between this city and New York . The old line Morse . . . was no where sic . House 's or the new , brought over the news , nearly the whole of it , before the old sent a word to anyone . Nearly all the papers issued extras before three o'clock , containing a hurried digest of news brought by the new wire ? the first day of its operation . " Moreover , concluded the editor , " the operators were obliging and skillful ; everyone drawing a contrast between them and the surly , unaccommodating officials who mismanage the old line in this city . " ' x Notwithstanding so promising a start , the House line did not live up to expectations for a number of reasons . Its three-strand cord of unprotected iron wire , although strong and of comparatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masts over the Hudson , while substantially constructed , were a source of constant trouble . The most serious obstacle to the success of the company , however , lay in its administration . Downing 's enthusiasm was no substitute for executive ability . Indiscretion and willfulness caused him to become exceedingly unpopular , especially among the business interests . Unwise interference where he lacked technical knowledge of the problems involved , and his failure to respect the confidential nature of the telegraph business , contributed further to the downfall of the company . ' 2 The House line , when working , took a fair amount of business on the New York-Philadelphia route , but its service became too erratic to make it a serious competitor of the well // established Morse line . In fact , it proved useful in shielding the Magnetic Telegraph Company from charges of monopoly . Of far graver concern to the Magnetic was the appearance of still another rival on the New York-Washington route during the spring of 1849 . The North American Telegraph , or " Bain line , " as the newcomer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the beginning . Under the vigorous administration of Zenas Barnum and Henry J. Rogers , the initial link of the new line from Washington to Baltimore was opened in April 1849 ; within two months it was well on towards Philadelphia with the old line anxiously speculating as to what the interloper could do.15 " If they get on no better than House , we wo n't be put to the expense of suing sic them at all , " Kendall wrote to Morse in a moment of wishful thinking . He concluded in more sober vein , " We should be ready to attack them should they become formidable . " 16 No more than six months had elapsed before the Magnetic Telegraph Company , finding competitive efforts insufficient to hold the field against its aggressive adversary , 17 resorted to legal means . In November a bill in equity was filed in the Circuit Court for the eastern district of Pennsylvania charging Alexander Bain with infringing the letters patent granted to Samuel F. B. Morse , and for the next two years another case of patentees vs. pirates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attack on the Morse interests more bitter or more justified than on the New York-Boston route . F. O. J. Smith 's line had been badly managed from the start . There was some reason to believe that it was part of a deliberate plan by means of which Smith hoped to gain possession of most of the stock of the New York k Boston Telegraph at depreciated values , and then to use his power to // establish a personal monopoly over one of the nation 's great communications arteries . He had disregarded the wishes of both the public and the press , and had alienated those who should have been friends of the line . There were few who felt other than satisfaction when , in the fall of 1847 , Hugh Downing announced his intention of constructing a House line ( Boston Rc New York Printing Telegraph Company ) from New York to Boston , immediately upon the completion of his New York-Philadelphia wire ( New Jersey Telegraph Company ) . F. O. J. Smith , thoroughly aroused by this threat to his sovereignty in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patent under which he proposed to operate . In a challenge which received wide publicity , Smith offered to bet $1,000 that his Durham bull weighing over 2,500 pounds could carry a message of 1,000 words from Boston to New York in less time than the House line.20 Downing , aware of the favorable publicity which he was getting at Smith 's expense , made a counter-proposal . If Smith would substitute Morse 's instrument in place of his celebrated bull and if he would have the trial made between New York and Philadelphia where each party had a line in operation , then Downing would bet him not $1,000 but $lo , 000 upon the following conditions : " to wit , $1,000 that he Smith can not transmit by Morse 's instruments a message of l , 000 words 6o minutes sooner than I Downing can the same message with House 's instruments ; $1,000 he can not do it 50 minutes sooner ; $1,000 that he can not do it 40 minutes sooner ; $1,000 that he can not do it 30 minutes sooner ; $1,000 that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can not do it 10 minutes sooner ; $1,000 that he can not do it on even time , and $3,000 that I will do it in less time than he can . " Furthermore , concluded Downing , if Smith was really desirous that his bull should figure in as a third competitor , he agreed to " start against both Morse 's instruments and the Bull " providing that Smith should ride his Durham.21 Hoist on his own petard in the House controversy , Smith observed // Boston.31 In addition to Smith 's pioneer New York &; Boston , or " Morse Line , " there was Downing 's Boston Sc New York Printing Telegraph , or " House Line , " 32 and O'Rielly 's New York and New England Telegraph , or " Bain Line . " 33 The cheaply built and badly administered " House Line " offered slight competition . The " Bain Line , " on the other hand , under the able direction of Marshall Lefferts and backed by such substantial capitalists as Edward Cooper and Abram S. Hewitt , was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicidal rate-war . Prior to the paralleling of his lines by competitors , he had been receiving fifty cents for Boston-New York messages of ten words or less , and three cents for each additional word.35 Determined to throw his full economic weight into the fray , the pioneer promoter reduced the tariff on his lines to two cents , and then to one cent a word , as the contest grew more heated.38 In addition , without even waiting to try the strength of the opposition , he filed suit against the Boston Sc New York Printing Telegraph Company in October , 37 and took similar steps against the New York Sc New England Telegraph Company in December 1849.38 Smith was trying to demonstrate the doctrine of invincibility , not only to his curious lieutenants , but to the entire telegraphic world . q THE situation in New York State was little different . Concomitant with the incursions upon the pioneer Morse lines along the seaboard // came a series of attacks upon the New York , Albany K. Buffalo Telegraph Company . Under Theodore Faxton 's shrewd direction this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent on the results of its first five months of operation . As the first telegraph dividend ever earned in the United States , its payment on February 15 , 1847 , had caused considerable comment.39 A second disbursement of 4 percent in October of the same year , further emphasized the practical aspect of electrical communication and drew especial attention to the profitable New York-Buffalo route.40 Financial success , coupled with an unpopular administration ? for Faxton held both public and press in utter contempt ? offered strong inducement to rival organizations.41 Following the established pattern on other routes , House and Bain lines were shortly contesting the field with the pioneer Morse line . But in the case of the New York , Albany &; Buffalo the situation was further complicated . In the spring of 1848 a second Morse company had started building from New York City to a point on Lake Erie just west of Buffalo thereby paralleling the New York , Albany &; Buffalo line . OF those who had scanned the financial reports of the New York , Albany &; Buffalo Telegraph Company , none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith . Under the broad powers given him as the Morse agent and regional director in New England , New York , and the old Northwest Territory by the Divisional Contracts of June 1847 , he had set about establishing a vast combination of lines under his personal control.42 The Erie &; Michigan , main artery ( ) I ' the proposed system along the Great Lakes , had been informally organized in 1847 ; and by the close of that year its line was under construction between Buffalo and Milwaukee . Moreover , arrangements had been made for hundreds of miles of feeder lines in Ohio , Illinois , Indiana , Michigan and Wisconsin . With plans in the Northwest well organized , Smith was ready for the next step in his program , // namely , the establishment of an eastern outlet for his prospective western business.43 To achieve this purpose , he worked out an ingenious plan for constructing a line from Dunkirk , a town some sixty miles west of Buffalo on the route of the Erie &; Michigan line , across southern New York State to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a line seemed doubtful . At the time that Smith and Kendall had drawn up the Divisional Contracts , it had been understood that the plans for construction of all the main lines had already been arranged . Subsequent grants of power , therefore , were supposed to apply only to the sale of patent rights for subsidiary , or branch lines.44 A line from New York City to Dunkirk such as Smith contemplated was clearly not a subsidiary line . He believed , however , that legally there was nothing to prevent him from building it as a subsidiary of the Erie &; Michigan , and operating it under the Morse patents . He was not concerned with the fact that his line would become a direct competitor of Faxton 's New York , Albany &; Buffalo system , and thereby constitute a violation of the contract which the patentees had already made with that company . Accordingly , in February 1848 , Smith had entered into an agreement with his associates , Cornell and Speed , to build the New York &; Erie line . Operations were to begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and construct the new line so as to intersect the Erie &; Michigan at Dunkirk . The New York &; Erie line , as projected , would largely parallel Faxton 's New York , Albany &; Buffalo . Passing across the southern part of New York State via Fredonia , Pike , Nunda , Dansville , and Ithaca , to Binghamton , it was to make its way through Montrose and Honesdale in Pennsylvania ; and then back across the New York State boundary to Middletown , Goshen , Newburgh , and West Point . There , it was to cross the Hudson and continue to New York City via Peekskill , Ossining , and White Plains . Construction was to be at the rate of $250 a mile for the first wire with an additional $loo a mile for all subsequent wires . Of this amount only $50 a mile in cash was to be paid for the patent right . According to the building contract , the line was to be erected with wire of the best quality , well insulated , and with forty lodes to the // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty poles to the mile , it suggested that the line was to be used as something more than a feeder of the Erie &; Michigan system . Of the excess over the actual cost of construction , whether in cash or stock , one half was to go to Smith , while the other half was to be divided between Cornell and Speed.45 Kendall was much concerned when news of the New York &; Erie project reached him . It was a grave threat to the New York , Albany Buffalo line , and he immediately questioned the legality of the action.46 Smith was ready with an answer . Apart from feeling confident of his legal position , he had a statement written by Kendall the year before , suggesting that just such a line should be built . The suggestion had arisen as a result of a quarrel between Kendall and Faxton respecting the rights of side lines that might connect with the New York , Albany &; Buffalo.47 Thoroughly aroused by Faxton 's opposition to what he regarded as the best interests of all parties concerned , Kendall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have briefly argued the question . . . have stated that if we can not obtain from them the connection we are morally bound to furnish and which is necessary to give value to the side lines , we shall be compelled to run another line through the State for that purpose , leaving them a branchless trunk . " 48 It had been a threat which Kendall had no intention of carrying out except as a last desperate resort . He could not afford to jeopardize either his own or Morse 's position in the most successful of the early Morse organizations , and a settlement had shortly been arranged . But Smith had not forgotten that letter . He now wrote reminding Kendall of it and expressing a willingness to help him triumph over Faxton . Instead of suspending work on the controversial New York // &; Erie line as Kendall requested , Smith urged Cornell to press forward with the enterprise as rapidly as possible.49 6 ALTHOUGH Smith , Cornell , and Speed were jointly interested in the construction of the New York &; Erie line , Cornell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith and Speed were occupied elsewhere . Smith was busy trying to cope with the rival companies which had invaded the New York-Boston area , while Speed was concerned with the management of their interests west of Buffalo , especially the Erie &; Michigan line . On March 29 , 1849 , Cornell received a further extension of power . Smith authorized him to sell the patent right for the side lines connecting with the New York &; Erie for cash on the best terms that he could arrange . Cornell needed no further invitation.50 He proceeded on the theory that it was to the interest of the patentees to sell the patent for all lines as fast as practicable and at whatever price could be obtained . He personally projected the Bridgeport-Bennington , the Troy-Whitehall , and the Auburn-Palmyra lines , to mention but a few.51 These lines were to be financed by stock subscriptions with 25 percent of each installment allocated for the patent right until the full amount had been paid.52 Unfortunately , subscriptions did not keep abreast of the promoter 's enthusiasm . Both on the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progressing with hardly enough funds to meet construction costs , leaving nothing for the patent right . " So aggressive were Cornell 's movements that even Smith , who had once admonished him to " dash on with all the battery and thunder and lightning " he could command , a4 sought to restrain him . Smith complained that Cornell rushed ahead without considering the // difficulties in which he involved his superior with Kendall . Smith urged a more conservative course . No further work should be undertaken on the New York &; Erie unless Cornell could pay Kendall , and all side lines which could not raise enough money to pay for the patent should be abandoned.55 Kendall , for his part , was greatly disturbed by what appeared to be a bold scheme to build up not only a piratical main line , but also numerous subsidiaries at the expense of the legitimate lines and to the detriment of his principals . Hundreds of miles of telegraph were being built in New York State without his knowledge and without the payment of so much as a dollar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be put was self-evident ; moreover , explanations made by Smith were both vague and unsatisfactory.56 That individual appeared not to know what operations were going forward in his territory . " Under the circumstances Kendall turned to Cornell and demanded an explanation of his building program . " Satisfy us that you have put a right estimate on your motives and intentions , " he urged , " and you will command our highest confidence . If you are to fill the country with lines of Morse 's Telegraph and pay nothing for it , in what respect but extravagant professions of fidelity , do you differ from O'Rielly . . . or the host of those you call Pirates ' ? " 58 With protestations of his loyalty to the Morse patentees , Cornell explained that the building of the New York &; Erie line had resulted from the unwarranted conduct of President Theodore S. Faxton of the New York , Albany &; Buffalo . Faxton 's line , instead of giving its western business to Cornell 's Erie &; Michigan system at Buffalo , had formed an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect itself against the unjustifiable policy of its eastern neighbor , the Erie &; Michigan had merely sought the means to command respect through the construction of a connection of its own with the seaboard.59 l8o ERA OF METHODLESS ENTHUSIASM Doubting the sincerity of the explanation , Kendall replied by asking Cornell a few rather pointed questions . First of all , had he not begun to build the New York &; Erie line before Faxton connected with O'Rielly ? Did Faxton not perceive that the New York , Albany &; Buffalo was to be cut off from the eastern business which might pass over Mr. Smith 's Lake line ? Had Faxton not good reasons to believe , therefore , that a connection with the O'Rielly line would give him more business than a connection with Smith 's line ? But such argument was beside the point . Regardless of Faxton 's conduct , pointed out Kendall , the Buffalo-New York business as a result of solemn contract belonged exclusively to the New York , Albany &; Buffalo Company . Kendall warned Cornell that he exposed himself to suits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. TRYING as the situation was , Cornell was not easily given to discouragement . In spite of the difficulties which beset his path , he had completed the controversial New York &; Erie line by the autumn of 1849 . On October 2 the meeting for formal organization was held in New York City . " 1 Smith was unable to be present , but he was well represented by his partner , Ezra Cornell , and his old friend , Thomas M. Clark , former treasurer of the Magnetic Telegraph Company . Writing to Cornell , Smith advised him not to assume the appearance of supreme control , and yet to direct , if possible , all arrangements ; while Clark was instructed to manage so as to be appointed not only director , but , if possible , secretary and treasurer . Smith visualized the New York &; Erie line as the great conduit " through which western gold would come clinking down to the sea , and he wanted a reliable man at the hopper . " At the same time cash subscribers were advised to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the cost of the patent , so as to secure its issue . " 02 Following the regular order of business , the company was capitalized at $110,000 , which was divided into 2,200 shares of $50 each . // Of this amount cash subscribers were to receive $35,000 , or less than one-third of the whole stock ; the remaining two-thirds was to be apportioned among Smith , Cornell and Speed . " Despite Smith 's carefully laid plans , arrangements did not work out entirely as he had anticipated . Cornell was made president , and Thomas M. Clark was elected secretary-treasurer , according to plan . But the cash subscribers refused to mortgage their stock to settle the claim of the patentees ; and the newly organized company refused to issue any stock to Smith , either for the patent right or for the profits of construction , until he had fulfilled certain conditions . The company denied Smith 's right to stock or money until he could convey to it a clear title to the Morse patent rights . So long as the O'Rielly controversy remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of their stock was less than half what it would have been otherwise ; therefore the amount due Smith was to be retained until the O'Rielly controversy was settled.s " Smith 's dream of empire was rudely shattered . The action of the New York &; Erie stockholders , and similar action by the Erie &; Michigan stockholders , excluded him from any share in the western spoils . Smith had been unwilling to settle the O'Rielly controversy until after his own lines had been erected ; he now found himself unable to make a settlement . Indeed , the O'Rielly companies were threatening suit against the Morse patentees for infringement of the O'Rielly contract . Having sown the wind , Smith was to reap the whirlwind . Cornell , Speed , and ? to a lesser extent ? Wade , were shortly to fall heirs to his domain in the West . " For some time relations between Smith and his lieutenants had been growing increasingly strained . Now , as he saw his telegraph empire in the West slipping from his grasp , he turned to Amos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of humility which immediately made Kendall suspicious , Smith admitted he had no right to build the New York &; Erie under the Divisional Contracts of June 1847 . He assured Kendall that if he understood the true facts 18 . E ERA OF METHODLESS ENTHUSIASM to give them special consideration if they would join him in rebuilding the line . The capitalization was to 1 ) e reduced to $J5,000 , divided into 2,200 shares of $25 each ; and former stockholders who wished to retain their corporate rights were asked to pay an assessment of $5.00 a share , and more later , should it be needed , to put the line into first class working order . Having reorganized the company under the corporate title , New York &; Western Union Telegraph Company , Cornell set out to establish the line on a paying basis . " WHILE Cornell 's New York &; Erie was proving far less troublesome to the New York , Albany &; Buffalo than Faxton had anticipated , other companies had also sprung up to contest the business on this strategic route . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bain and House patents with Henry O'Rielly and Samuel L. Selden as the respective promoters . A rupture had occurred between O'Rielly and his former friend and associate , Judge Selden , as a result of a misunderstanding between the Rochester group ( Atlantic , Lake &; Mississippi Telegraph ) , which had first sponsored O'Rielly , and the Pittsburgh group ( Joshua Hanna , John I. Roggen , and others ) , which had superseded them and had subsequently become his trustees . On the grounds that the Rochester group had failed to live up to the articles of agreement of the Atlantic , Lake and Mississippi Telegraph Company , the Pittsburgh trustees had refused to recognize the Rochester claims for stock in the O'Rielly lines . Although there was no wish on the part of either group to hurt O'Rielly , he was caught between their conflicting views.78 Moreover , O'Rielly had permitted his personal affairs to become somewhat confused with those of the companies in which he had an interest . Impatient at delays in his building program , O'Rielly had assumed debts and liabilities for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time his Rochester allies were THE WAR IN THE EAST 18 rj building the line in 1847.79 By the fall of 1849 the Lake Erie 's creditors were pressing O'Rielly hard for payment of this debt and even threatening suit . Friends in Rochester had been appealed to in vain . They could not relieve O'Rielly from his crushing debt , they told him , until he had adjusted their claims against him for stock on his lines west of Pittsburgh ? claims which the Pittsburgh trustees refused to recognize . O'Rielly suffered keenly as a result of this misunderstanding , and his attitude toward his former Rochester friends grew bitter.80 When Samuel L. Selden , who had invested heavily in the House invention , announced his intention of building a line of telegraph through New York State along the New YorkAlbany-Buffalo route in the autumn of 1849 , O'Rielly promptly took to the field with the Bain patent.81 A heated race up the Hudson and through the Mohawk Valley ensued . The spring of 185o found Selden completing plans for the formal organization of the New York State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization of the Merchants ' State Telegraph Company.83 Meanwhile the New York , Albany &; Buffalo was preparing for a fight . Under the direction of Theodore Faxton , a bold offensive was launched . A resolution of non-intercourse with all lines not operating // under the Morse patent was adopted ; dividends were suspended ; and rates were reduced.8 ' As the decade which had witnessed the practical introduction of the telegraph drew to a close , House and Bain lines were to be found in competition with every one of the original Morse lines in the East . Notwithstanding the fact that both the public and the press wished the newcomers well , on no route was a Morse company in danger of being driven out of business . Priority in the field may , in part , explain the strong position of the Morse companies but the chief source of their strength lay in the relative simplicity of the Morse machine as compared with the complex House and Bain instruments . While they worked equally well and in some respects better than the Morse apparatus under ideal conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sounder on the primitive lines of the day . CHAPTER XI A House Divided 1 . THE methodless enthusiasm which marked the birth of the telegraph industry in the United States reached its peak in the early 185o 's . Within the Morse family itself were to be found three rival groups all claiming the exclusive right to use the Morse instruments on the main arteries of the nation . Four Bain and three House companies operating over main routes ? to say nothing of the many organizations operating on subsidiary lines ? further complicated the situation . All the ills of multiple management and duplicating service were apparent . Inability to fix responsibility for errors in transmission , and high costs when messages passed over the wires of more than one company , made the public reluctant to use the telegraph for long distance communication . Contradictory rules of operation , poorly constructed lines , and inexperienced and inefficient operators contributed to the general dissatisfaction with the service . Under the circumstances telegraph companies were impoverished . Of the twenty-three leading organizations at the opening of the decade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were barely managing to pay expenses ; the majority were sinking deeper into debt each month . Public confidence was still further alienated by the internal dissension within the telegraph fraternity . Quarrels , lawsuits , and shifting loyalties characterized the relations of its members . Selfish motives often caused promoters to lose sight entirely of the general welfare , and too frequently the public interest was sacrificed to the ambition of one rival to triumph over another . Although there had been some attempt at the concealment of early differences , by the 1850 's there could no longer be any doubt that the telegraph industry was , indeed , a house divided against itself . Controversy between the O'Reilly interests and the Morse patentees had been allowed to drag on for years notwithstanding . attempts by both sides to negotiate a peace . Morse had Informed // Kendall , soon after the outbreak of trouble in 1847 , that he was " the more inclined to make every possible allowance for O'Rielly and his associates from the fact that Mr. Smith 's design . . . in desiring to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was legally so . " 1 O'Rielly , Hanna , Moorhead , and Kendall had likewise been disposed to compromise . Even Smith feigned a willingness to arbitrate . On half a dozen occasions negotiations looking toward a settlement had been entered into between the O'Rielly companies and Smith , but he had skillfully blocked all efforts to reach an agreement.2 The situation for Morse , Kendall , and Vail had become more and more aggravated as time passed . O'Rielly and his associates , embittered by their fruitless efforts to reach a settlement , had begun a driving attack on the Morse patent in an effort to discredit it . In the fall of 1847 the irate Irishman had offered a prize of $30o for the best essay on " The Progress of Electrical Discovery , with Reference to the Telegraph System . " It was his intention , O'Rielly declared , to acquaint the public with the history of the telegraph invention so that people might see how false it was for any man to set himself up as the sole inventor and therefore entitled to a patent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's subtle propaganda began to bear fruit . " My affairs are at this moment gloomy , " the distressed Morse had written in the midst of the indignation which O'Rielly had aroused . " My opponents , O'Rielly and Co. , by their misrepresentation and perversion have created a hostile feeling throughout the whole West towards me . . . . I am looked upon as an odious monopolizer endeavoring to monoplize the use of one of God 's elements , electricity , ' for my own benefit . . . . The House humbug is held up as a stalking horse to terrify and to invite opposition . . . . Opposition companies are organizing and find no difficulty , it is said , in finding capitalists to help them and to oppose me ... . What they may effect it is impossible for me to say . " 4 Such a campaign if continued could not fail to injure seriously the Morse patentees . Kendall , therefore , redoubled his efforts to reach an agreement with the O'Reilly interests . Early in 18iq , Hanna had implied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // ? instead of the original one-fourth ? of all the stock on the lines west of Pittsburgh provided an immediate settlement could be made . Kendall was jubilant for he did not see how Smith could refuse so generous an offer . In confident manner he wrote his co-proprietor of his conversations with Hanna : Smith did not share his partner 's elation . In a few brief paragraphs he replied that he was the only one empowered to make a settlement and that Mr. Kendall would do well to look to his own affairs.6 By this time Kendall had had adequate proof of the failure of his policy of appeasement . Concession had only led to demands for further concession , and in the end there had been no solution to the trying problem of harmonizing relations with Smith . Kendall now felt that he had no recourse but to the courts . ' With the opening of the year 1850 a further factor complicated the relations between Smith and his co-patentees . On the last day of the old year Smith had informed the New York Associated Press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either // his Portland or his Boston Sc New York line . The action had come about as the result of Smith 's ambition to establish a foreign news monopoly over the important Halifax-New York route . Controlling the only line between Portland and Boston , he had reasoned that his policy of non-intercourse would very quickly bring the press association to terms . The Associated Press , however , refused to yield to coercion ; and beginning in January its press reports were transmitted by telegraph to Portland at which point they were transferred to a locomotive express and carried across the 110 mile gap to Boston where they were turned over to the new Bain company for transmission to New York City . Meanwhile the public suffered as a result of the needless delay in obtaining the news from abroad . With each succeeding day , public displeasure became more manifest ; by early spring the press was openly attacking not only Smith but the entire Morse patent interest . Morse companies with which Smith had no association shared in the general condemnation.8 On April 12 , 1850 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with whom Smith was on the most intimate terms , warned his friend of the short-sightedness of his policy . " Now my dear Smith , " he urged , " for God Almighty 's sake , and for my sake do come to some terms with the Patentees and the Press . You are injuring yourself and the whole Morse Telegraphic interest by the course you are now pursuing . . . . When a settlement has been made and all the Morse Telegraph interests pull one way , we have before us an enterprise that will beat California and all its gold out and out . " e Settlement , however , seemed unlikely . Smith 's co-patentees had reached the limit of their endurance . Believing that Smith 's utmost hostility would be less harmful than their seeming acquiescence in his manipulations , they announced publicly their opposition to his nonintercourse act and then began preparations for legal proceedings against him . With a great show of bravado Smith retaliated publicly : " Mr. Kendall threatens to sue me , let him sue . I will blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody but myself , Prof. Morse , and the Almighty knows what the facts are . " ' ? Kendall began preparations at once for bringing the suit to trial . " // He sought by injunction to restrain Smith from any further acts as the agent for the Morse Patentees . Countless difficulties now intervened . Kendall became seriously ill.Y2 Henry W. Ellsworth , who was chosen to conduct the fight against Smith , proved unworthy and squandered the money paid him without producing any results.Y1 When the case finally came before the court late in November 1852 , the evidence of Smith 's abuse of power was not clearly established and the injunction was denied.14 WHILE the triangular Smith-Morse-O'Rielly feud was the focal point in the general dissension which racked the telegraph industry , it was by no means the only conflict . Morse had become involved in a public quarrel with his former friend , Professor Joseph Henry , which was creditable to neither man.15 Moreover , the deluded Dr. Jackson of Boston was still attempting to prove that he , not Morse , should receive the credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and assailed by doubts of every kind , began to wonder if Kendall was really working in his best interests . Nurturing the doubt , Smith assured Vail that Kendall 's ignorance of the law was appalling , and implied that Vail was being used as a cat 's paw to pull Morse 's telegraphic chestnuts out of the fire.17 While no actual rupture occurred , the feeling between Vail , on the one hand , and Kendall and Morse , on the other , ceased to be cordial . " As has already been pointed out , Smith and his former subordi- // nates , Cornell and Speed , had become estranged.79 Speed 's droll letter to Cornell , in August 1852 , reviews the differences which ultimately led Smith to bring suit against them . " It is apparent that we are to have trouble with Smith or give him half the stock on our line Erie &; Michigan and 30 dollars per mile for profits of construction . This you very properly say you wo n't do . Smith now threatens to make the best terms he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , let him try his hand at that . It only requires a fight between us and Smith to complete the circuit-the family will then have had a fight all around . " Smith 's intimation that failure to get satisfaction from the Erie 8c Michigan would cause him to make terms with its rival , the Rochester-controlled Lake Erie Telegraph Company , was no idle threat . In fact , his plans for making just such an about-face were already well advanced . Incredible as it may seem , the closing days of 1851 had brought forth a strange and unholy alliance between F. O. J. Smith and Henry O'Rielly . It was a relationship born of expediency rather than choice . Although having small regard for one another , each party to the arrangement foresaw how the other might serve him . At the time of entering into the alliance on December 2 , 1851 , both signatories were in straitened circumstances . O'Rielly had gone through bankruptcy earlier in the year , 22 while judgments against Smith could be purchased for ten cents on the dollar.23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adversity made a pretense of settling the interminable O'Rielly controversy . It provided that Smith was to convey the Morse patent right to the O'Rielly companies in exchange for a quarter part of the stock and a like proportion of all the dividends declared to date . Of the amount so received whether in stock or dividends , Smith was to refund one . fifth to O'Rielly . In addition , O'Rielly was to waive all claims 1,11 damages against the patentees , and in return , they conceded to h i m // the exclusive right to construct lines of telegraph on the unoccupied routes in the northern portions of Indiana and Illinois , eastern Iowa , Wisconsin , and Michigan.24 For O'Rielly the contract spelled opportunity ? a chance to start anew on the frontier . For Smith it promised some financial relief ; moreover , through recognition of the O'Rielly lines as the legitimate Morse lines in the West , it provided him with an opportunity to harass his former lieutenants , Speed and Cornell , on the Great Lakes and his former partner , Kendall , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alliance were negative . No one seemed to take their contract seriously . The O'Rielly companies refused to observe its provisions . Their various boards of directors looked upon Smith " with the most utter contempt " and had come to regard his " every movement , a trick . " Smith 's attempt to inspire the proper respect for his authority through injunction also failed . Nor was he any more successful in obtaining Kendall 's cooperation in the plan of settlement . Upon being informed of the nature of the rapprochement , Kendall denounced it as inconsistent with a settlement in the true meaning of the Divisional Contracts . In addition , he warned that Smith would be liable for damages if through any arrangement with the O'Rielly companies , he should injure the Morse lines in the Ohio Valley.25 Smith , thereupon , contended that he had tried to settle the O'Rielly dispute , but that his co-patentees would not cooperate with him . Under the circumstances Smith declared that he regarded himself as released from further obligation to them.26 In the years when unity of action was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menaced it from within , while rival I louse and Bain systems threatened it from without . It was , indeed , a house divided . CHAPTER XII The Trend Toward Consolidation 1 As the situation within the telegraph industry had grown more and more desperate , its leaders had become convinced that the only hope for salvation lay in organization , cooperation , and consolidation . Kendall 's dream of a closely coordinated series of Morse companies indirectly controlled by the patentees and linking all the important points of the nation had been dissipated by the O'Rielly quarrel , the treachery of F. O. J. Smith , and the entrance of rival House and Bain companies into the field . Almost as ephemeral had been the plan of Henry O'Rielly for a great democratic telegraph association to which all of his companies should send delegates to talk over their common problems and decide matters of general policy . With the first meeting of the General Council of the Atlantic , Lake &; Mississippi Telegraph system in New York City on July 16 , 185o , it became apparent that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be ineffectual . ' With no means for compelling the allegiance of its member companies , the Atlantic , Lake &; Mississippi system had rapidly deteriorated . Less ambitious but much more effective were the working agreements , leases , and consolidations arranged between some of the companies during the early 185o 's . In the East , the North American Telegraph , or Bain line , after the defeat of its patent claims at the hands of the Magnetic in November 1851 , welcomed the Morse company 's reasonable offer of consolidation.2 As a result , its property , consisting of two wires between New York and Washington , was surrendered to its rival the following January in exchange for an issue of $83,000 of Magnetic stock.3 // Shortly after this union the receipts of the Magnetic showed an increase of loo percent . The dividend record of the Magnetic during this period gives an excellent idea of how vigorous the opposition had been . For the four years ending with 1851 , dividends had been 6 percent , 9 percent , 2 percent , and 2 percent per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent while in 1853 and 1854 they were 13 percent per annum , and thereafter , dividends of 12 percent were paid quite regularly.4 The defeat of the Bain patent on the New York-Washington route had repercussions elsewhere . Six months after the consolidation of the North American with the Magnetic Telegraph Company , a similar merger of Morse and Bain lines took place on the New YorkBoston route . After suitable preliminaries , Smith 's New York &; Boston Magnetic and the Bain-operated New York &; New England agreed to unite in a new organization to be known as the New York &; New England Union Telegraph Company . Of the joint capital of $300,000 , two-thirds was to be issued to the Morse company and onethird to the Bain interest . ' Among the other provisions , it was expressly stipulated that F. O. J. Smith was not to have a controlling interest in the new organization . ' On July 1 , 1852 , therefore , the New York &; New England Union Telegraph Company was organized with Henry M. Schieffelin as president and Levi L. Sadler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the consolidation prove that on October 9 , 1852 , a dividend of 2 percent was declared from the earnings of the first quarter . ' Developments on the New York-Buffalo route were following a similar pattern . Simultaneously with the Morse and Bain consolidation in New England , Faxton 's powerful New York , Albany Sc Buffalo was purchasing the Bain-operated New York State , or Merchants ' State Telegraph Company. ? The sale was effected on June 7 , 1852 , // the Morse company agreeing to pay $65,379.20 , of which $26,079.20 was to be in cash and the balance in New York , Albany &; Buffalo stock at par.lo The trend towards consolidation did not stop there . On January 11 , 1853 , Faxton leased the wires of Cornell 's hapless New York &; Western Union Telegraph Company for two years at $2,000 per annum.11 The previous January , it may be recalled , Cornell 's line , then operating under the name of the New York &; Erie , had gone through bankruptcy , at which time it had been purchased by Cornell for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Erie Railroad right of way , but despite Cornell 's best efforts the line could not be made to pay . As a result , Cornell had readily entertained Faxton 's proposals ? modest as they were ? for leasing the line . Faxton , for his part , was interested primarily in removing a competitor from the field . It was no surprise to him to find the New York &; Western Union in no condition for service and utterly without revenue . Upon expiration of the lease , therefore , it was not renewed , and the ill-starred New York Sc . Western Union Telegraph Company passed quietly out of existence.13 NOWHERE was the need for consolidation more evident than on the Mississippi Valley route to New Orleans . On this important artery Kendall 's New Orleans &; Ohio and O'Rielly 's People 's Telegraph Company had effectively stalemated one another.14 From the beginning their ill-fated courses had run parallel . The O'Rielly concern , it may be recalled , had gone bankrupt after attempts at rehabilitation had failed in the spring of 185o . At that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the interests of the connecting O'Rielly lines of which he was superintendent . Not until the autumn // of that year did he succeed in establishing contact between New Orleans and New York , by way of the Mississippi Valley . But his efforts to maintain the line on a paying basis failed . With each passing month it went more deeply into debt . Kendall 's New Orleans &; Ohio , for its part , while making no money and often not even meeting expenses , had the negative distinction of being somewhat less indigent than its ; rival . Apart from that fact , their situations were similar . Both companies depended largely on their " through " business for support . Both were confronted by the difficult problem of maintaining uninterrupted service over hundreds of miles of unprotected and fragile wire . Neither was able to maintain its through service more than half of the time , and each had operating expenses in excess of $15o a day . All the evils of competition were present to aggravate the technical problems attendant upon the development of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orleans Sc Ohio and the People 's Telegraph Company were threatened with extinction . Under the circumstances the forces working for consolidation proved irresistible . In consequence an agreement was entered into for the joint operation of the two companies for a period of one year from the first of June 1852 . The advantages of cooperative effort became readily apparent . Savings in excess of $22,000 were effected in the first six months of joint operation , and by the end of a year , representatives of both companies were ready to translate their tentative business agreement into a permanent union . ' William Tanner , New Orleans &; Ohio president , expressed the general feeling when he informed his stockholders just prior to the merger that operating separately the property of neither party was likely to be of any material value ; united , the stock of both would unquestionably be better and might become quite valuable.17 To carry out the terms of the consolidation , the People 's Telegraph was dissolved , and on May 13 , 1853 , its property was sold to its former rival , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agreement which was to become effective on June 1 , the New Orleans Sc Ohio Telegraph Company agreed to issue to the stockholders of the People 's Telegraph an amount of New Orleans Sc Ohio stock equal // to $150 a mile over the 9571/3 miles which comprised the People 's line ; or upon presentation of nine and one-half shares of People 's stock ( par value $5o each ) , the stockholder was to receive one share of stock in the New Orleans &.; Ohio ( par value $loo each ) . In addition , the New Orleans &; Ohio agreed " to assume debts of the People 's line to the amount of $40,000 which was to be paid out of net proceeds of the lines of both parties and to be pro rata with a debt of $27,000 owing by the New Orleans &; Ohio . " William Tanner was made president , George L. Douglass , secretary and treasurer , and James D. Reid , superintendent of the consolidated company.18 AMONG the lines leading into the West a similar movement was under way . Everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a realization that in consolidation lay their only hope of making their lines generally profitable . Addressing the stockholders of the Cleveland &; Cincinnati Telegraph Company on June 28 , 1852 , President Jeptha H. Wade warned of the critical times through which the industry was passing and stressed the urgency of a sound financial position and the proper business connections if the company was to survive the changes which he believed to be imminent . Discussing the question of consolidation he declared , " If all the prominent lines were consolidated in one Company , it would add much to the reliability of the system , and consequently to the amount of business to be done . It would save a large expenditure that is now required to support separate officers for each line in every town and city , and the saving in this item alone , would make a handsome dividend on the whole capital employed in the business . This is but one among many advantages to be derived by such a union ? business being better done , with less delay , fewer mistakes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double , even quadruple in amount , the public would be better served , stockholders better paid , and the Telegraph made to answer in every respect more perfectly the purpose for which it was designed . " As we are evidently on the eve of a revolution in the business that must materially benefit those Companies that are taken into . . . consolidation on favorable terms , and leave others in a worse position than they now are , it scents to me to be very important that Ave take // the course that shall put us in the best possible position to negotiate with other lines . " 19 Wade 's analysis of the situation was sound . The telegraph business was on the eve of a revolution which was to increase in intensity until the last vestige of independent organization had been swept away and the industry had emerged as the nation 's first great monopoly . The year ' 1852 merely foreshadowed the future . In the West at this time the movement was apparent only in the efforts of Cornell , Speed , and Wade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hand , and in the earnest attempts of James D. Reid , de facto successor to O'Rielly , on the other , to increase the extent and vitality of the systems under their control . The obvious need for coordinating the operation of the various O'Rielly units , and the failure of the Atlantic , Lake &; Mississippi system to achieve this purpose , had led a number of the companies to appoint Reid as their common superintendent . Reid , Hanna , Moorhead , and some of the other leaders had labored zealously to establish close working alliances among the O'Rielly lines and with contiguous companies . In addition to the mutual exchange of business the Atlantic &; Ohio and the Pittsburgh , Cincinnati &; Louisville companies employed a common superintendent , occupied the same office in Pittsburgh , adopted the same rules , and elected a number of the same directors . ' ? They , in turn , entered into a working alliance with the New Orleans &; Ohio in June 1852.21 The following nonth the Pittsburgh , Cincinnati &; Louisville had instigated an alliance with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working agreements were concluded with the Ohio Sc Mississippi and the Illinois &; Mississippi Companies . " Moreover , arrangements were entered into with // a number of other companies for the mutual exchange of business.24 James D. Reid strove earnestly to bring more closely together this great , loosely-bound combination of lines , which came to be known as the National Lines system . Time and again he urged upon the boards of the different companies the need for consolidation . The only real safety , declared Reid , lay in monopoly . " You are safe only in absolute control over your whole interests as far as your arm can reach , though in doing so your fingers freeze upon an iceberg and your toes burn at the meridian , " he had told the Pittsburgh , Cincinnati &; Louisville stockholders in his report for 1851.25 But local jealousies , personal antagonisms , and the ruthless tactics of opposing interests were to prove more than a match for the hard-working but mediocre Reid.26 One after another the lines composing the system were to slip away until the National Lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wade worked equally hard to build up their system which centered around the important Erie &; Michigan line between Buffalo and Milwaukee.27 Hundreds of miles of feeder line pledged to exclusive connection with their main line had been built by the promoters . Furthermore , their policy of expansion had led them to buy up numerous bankrupt lines in the Northwest in the hope that once the impoverished lines were incorporated into their system , they would become profitable . It was in keeping with this policy that Cornell had purchased a controlling interest in the Ohio , Indiana &; Illinois by buying O'Rielly 's stock for $2.50 a share.29 This transaction marked the beginning of the actual dissolution of the O'Rielly system.30 O'Rielly 's holdings in the stock of this line had been large , and through the purchase Cornell was able to turn the bankrupt organization from its allegiance to Reid 's National Lines // system and draw it into the Erie &; Michigan orbit.3 ' - It was but a matter of time until the other O'Rielly units were absorbed by more aggressive organizations . WHILE the leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was born in Rochester , New York , an insignificant little company which was to play a great role in the future of the telegraph industry ? the New York Sc Mississippi Valley Printing Telegraph Company . As early as 1847 , Hugh Downing , Judge Samuel L. Selden , and several of their associates had become interested in the promotion of the House printing telegraph throughout the United States.J2 Downing 's activities had been confined to the seaboard and New England , where they had resulted in the organization of the New Jersey Magnetic and the Boston 8c New York Printing Telegraph Company . Samuel L. Selden , Freeman M. Edson , and Royal Chamberlain , having become the exclusive owners of the patent for the State of New York , had organized the New York State Printing Telegraph Company in 1849 , and a moderately good line had been constructed linking New York with Buffalo . In the meantime , Selden and Edson had secured the House patent rights for the remainder of the United States . According to the terms of the contract Royal E. House and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to receive one-fourth interest in all lines which might be constructed and operated using House instruments . " Selden and Edson , eager to exploit the vast field thus opened to them , set out to organize a company to operate in the territory west of Buffalo . Well-known and respected in the progressive and rapidly growing city of Rochester , Selden turned to its business men for assistance . The support of a number of them was finally enlisted among whom was the aggressive , wide-awake Hiram Sibley ; and the New York 8c Mississippi Valley Printing Telegraph Company was organized on April 1 , 1851 , to construct a line of telegraph from // Buffalo to St. Louis.3 " Considering the chaotic conditions which existed in the industry at this time , it is not surprising that Selden , Sibley , and their associates found it difficult to secure the necessary money to carry out their project , and the immediate results were disappointing . In fact , during the first few years of its existence , in spite of the best efforts of its promoters , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telegraph company . 5 A GENERAL survey of the telegraph scene at the close of 1852 presents an immediate picture of hopeless confusion , but a closer examination shows a clear and unmistakable trend toward consolidation . The New York &; New England Union Telegraph Company dominated New England ; Kendall 's Magnetic controlled the route from New York to Washington , and also largely dominated the policies and business of the Washington &; New Orleans extending on southward along the coast to New Orleans ; and the New York , Albany &; Buffalo , while facing the competition of the Rochester controlled New York State Printing Telegraph Company , gave no signs of relinquishing its leadership on this route to its ambitious rival . The Mississippi Valley route to New Orleans was feebly held by the New Orleans &; Ohio and the People 's Telegraph Companies , which were on the verge of consolidating . The situation in the West , while still in a state of upheaval , was gradually assuming definite shape . A nucleus of former O'Rielly lines ? the Atlantic &; Ohio and the Pittsburgh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all under the superintendency of James D. Reid , constituted the National Lines system . The Erie &; Michigan with dozens of small feeder lines extending throughout the whole Northwest , under the direction of Cornell , Speed , and Wade , made up another formidable system in the West . Finally , the New York &; Mississippi Valley Printing Telegraph Company under the leadership of Hiram Sibley , while it had made no spectacular progress in the first two years of its existence , had learned much and was now ready to embark upon a program of expansion which was to carry it to fame and fortune as the Western Union Telegraph Company ? a title it was shot tly to assume . , tt ncLtils cou ( rrning ih ( otl ; u ( iatinu of this company ate In esentcti in ( atal1tc1 xst . CHAPTER XIII The Railroad and the Telegraph 1 . THE introduction of the railroad into the United States parallels so closely the advent of the telegraph that the story of the one can not be told properly without touching upon that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his telegraph , the Baltimore &; Ohio Railroad had begun the construction of a dubious little railway line into the ' West . Sixteen years later , in the spring of 1844 , the telegraph had made its official debut , significantly enough , on the Baltimore &; Ohio right of way . Telegraph leaders had become aware almost at once of the advantages to be derived from constructing their lines along the railroads , but the restrictions with which the Baltimore &; Ohio hedged its first telegraph agreement gave evidence that the railroad , far from seeing any value in the telegraph , barely suffered it to build along the railroad right of way.1 In fact , many less liberal railroads refused to be bothered with electric wires along their roadbeds . Some years were to pass before the natural affinity of wire and rail came to be recognized by the conservative railway managements . In both railroad and telegraph construction the initial period , which drew to a close about 185o , had been one of methodless enthusiasm . ' Wires had been strung and rails laid with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break into virgin territory . Samuel W. McGowan , canvassing for telegraph subscriptions in Canton and Potsdam , New York , in July 1849 , informed his principal , Ezra Cornell , that he found every person of any little capital and influence so completely involved in the Boston Railroad that they would not listen to anything in favor of a telegraph line . " The people are Railroad mad , " declared McGowan , " . . . and more than one man in this vicinage is bordering on absolute bankruptcy in consequence of the Railroad mania . " 2 Although progress had been made by both the telegraph and the railroad during the 1840 's and the great future which lay ahead began // to be foreshadowed , neither enterprise could be termed an assured success as the decade drew to a close . The telegraph had certainly not won the public confidence , and the railroad was hardly capable of competition with the canals.3 It was during the next decade ? 185o to 186o ? when sober consolidation began to bring order out of enthusiastic chaos that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tl indispensable " Siamese twins of commerce . " 4 As great railway trunk lines and extended telegraphic systems began to absorb the haphazard pioneer lines which sprawled over the countryside , and order and efficiency began to appear , the attitude of the public became one of approbation and support Because of the comparative ease and lower cost of construction , telegraphic development rapidly eclipsed railroad growth during the period . " Lightning lines " reached out to embrace every town and city connected by rail , and then pushed on beyond the railroad frontiers . In most parts of the West the " iron cord " preceded the " iron horse . " 5 Hiram Sibley succeeded in pushing a " lightning line " all the way to the Pacific , eight years in advance of the railroad . The telegraph as well as the railroad is entitled to a share of the credit for the prodigious development of the West . THAT the telegraph was the natural complement of the railroad had been quickly recognized in Europe , where wires were commonly strung along the railroad rights of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Western Railway Company , testified that Cooke and Wheatstone 's telegraph had been brought into actual operation upon the Great Western Railway as early as 1839 and its capabilities severely tested . Shortly thereafter the Yarmouth &; Norwich Railway issued a circular explaining at length Cooke 's new system of train dispatching by telegraph which the road had adopted in 18 . , H. Through the use of this system the railway officials claimed that they // had been free from accidents arising from trains meeting or overtaking one another , even though the Yarmouth and Norwich was a single track line. ? American railroads confronted with similar traffic problems were slow to turn to the telegraph for their solution . Typical was the action of the pioneer Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company in 1846 . Officials of the line were concerned by the growing number of accidents which seemed to be in direct ratio to the increasing volume of traffic . Accidents involving serious damage and in some instances loss of life were of almost daily occurrence . The chief engineer , Samuel Jones , was asked to report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He reported that the only effective solution was to doubletrack the line , a project hardly feasible in view of the straitened circumstances of the company . Although Morse 's experimental telegraph line had been in operation along the Baltimore Sc Ohio tracks since 1844 , no mention of the telegraph was made among Jones ' suggestions for improvement . Neither he nor other railroad men , at this time , considered it a possible method of regulating the movement of trains.8 On the single-track lines of the day , trains were operated on what was known as a " time interval system . " Under this arrangement trains were designated as " superior " and " inferior " according to their class and the direction in which they moved . The Baltimore &; Ohio Railroad , for example , gave the right of way over other trains of its class to the train going east , while the Erie Railroad gave priority to the train going west.9 Inferior trains were required to wait one hour at designated passing points for late superior trains . At the expiration of that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would start a flagman on foot to the next station , the train following slowly ten minutes later . This procedure was continued until the trains met . If the meeting occurred between stations , the train nearest a siding or the train of lesser importance would back up.10 Sometimes a battle // of fisticuffs between the respective crews settled the controversy.11 During its early days the Boston k Worcester Railroad maintained a relay of horses at five mile intervals along the route to report the location of retarded trains . By this means the company was able to diminish the possibility of accidents or excessive delay.12 Despite the evident need for some system of determining the location of trains along the route , railroaders were reluctant to trust the telegraph for the movement of their trains ; nor were they to be blamed entirely . Pioneer telegraphy in the United States left much to be desired in the way of dependability . J. H. Wade recalled his efforts to induce J. W. Brooks , president of the Michigan Central Railroad , to permit him to build along that road 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Why , " exclaimed he , " I had rather have one hand car for keeping my road in repair and handling my trains than all the telegraph lines you can build . " Wade admitted that after a reluctant consent had been obtained and the line built , it " worked with about the same regularity as most of the early lines ? which was n't very regular . " Sometimes it aided materially , and at other times , when needed most , it was out of order . It took several years to perfect the telegraph lines to the point where they were worthy of the full confidence of the railroad officials . THE first train official to realize the potentialities of the telegraph for railroad use in this country seems to have been Charles Minot , superintendent of the New York k Erie Railroad . At least , it was he who first demonstrated the value of the telegraph as a vital agent in the management of railroads , the running of trains , and the insuring of the safety of the passengers . Minot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erie Telegraph line in 1849 , conceived the idea that this new means of communication could be of practical service to his recently reorganized railroad . Accordingly , he proposed to the directors that a line of telegraph be built paralleling the railroad . They laughed at him and declared it to be an absurd idea . Minot persisted , however , asserting that such a line would pay for itself in one year . The greatest objection the directors raised was // that operators ' salaries would more than offset any benefit which might be derived from the line . Minot met their objections by explaining that the various depot masters and clerks could be used as operators at no extra expense to the railroad.14 Having finally obtained the requisite authority , Minot proceeded to equip the Erie with a telegraph system . By the latter part of 185o it had been completed between Piermont , the Erie terminal on the Hudson River , and Goshen , New York . At this time passengers , freight , livestock , mail pouches , and baggage were transferred from the trains at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Duane Street in New York City by steamer . Little of the produce in the Piermont warehouse could be loaded , however , before the arrival of the train from the west , because a considerable portion of the deck had to be reserved for an unknown number of livestock . Since the stevedores were laid off between trains , this system of operation resulted in great loss for them as well as unnecessary delay for the passengers.15 The operator at Piermont , D. H. Conklin , who had learned telegraphy under Cornell , was aware of the needless waste of time and money which the existing system entailed . One day early in January 1851 , therefore , Conklin arranged with the conductor of a stock train to telegraph information regarding his cargo from Goshen . By this means the rivermen were enabled to load their barges , reserving only sufficient space for the number of livestock which would be arriving by train . Instead of the two hours usually consumed in loading after the arrival of the train , thirty minutes sufficed to start the barges on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed to have been the first practical application of the telegraph for facilitating railroad work in the United States.16 In June 1851 , came a still more important application of the telegraph to railroading . One day Superintendent Minot chanced to be aboard the westbound express which was scheduled to meet the eastbound express at Turners ( now Harriman ) , New York . A few minutes elapsed and the belated train still had not arrived . Stepping into the telegraph office at Turners , Minot inquired of the operator // at Goshen whether the eastbound train had left his station . Receiving a negative reply , Minot telegraphed Goshen as follows : To Agent and Operator at Goshen Hold the train for further orders . Chas . Minot , Superintendent . He then wrote this order and handed it to the amazed conductor : To Conductor and Engineer , Day Express Run to Goshen regardless of opposing train . Chas . Minot , Superintendent . " I took the order , " said conductor W. H. Stewart , relating the incident , " showed it to engineer , Isaac Lewis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised engineer read the order , and handing it back to Stewart exclaimed : " Do you take me for a d - - n fool ? I wo n't run by that thing ! " Stewart reported to the superintendent , who went forward and personally issued the order . But the engineer was unyielding . Minot then climbed aboard the engine and took charge himself . Engineer Lewis jumped off and got in the rear seat of the rear car where he remained , while the superintendent ran the train to Goshen . The eastbound train had not yet reached that station . He telegraphed to Middletown . The train had not arrived there . The westbound train was run on a similar order to Middletown , and from there to Port Jervis , where it entered the yard from the east as the other train came onto it from the west.17 Although attended with no ceremony and attracting little attention , Minot 's experiment was ultimately to lead to a revolution in American railway operation . The doubt and distrust with which the railroad interest had long regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " demonstration . Even on Minot 's own line , open revolt broke out among the apprehensive trainmen when an attempt was made to introduce a modified form of electric train dispatching . But the enlightened general superintendent had the courage of his convictions , and orders were issued designating certain division superintendents as train dispatchers with authority to direct the movement of trains under specified conditions . The first train ( it ders were crude and handled with considerable uneasiness ; but as time brought . con17 Ibid. , 418 . t.u. // fidence and improved service , the system developed , and reports of its popularity spread to connecting roads which after investigation began similar services . " More than a decade was to pass , however , before telegraphic train dispatching attained any general adoption . The Pennsylvania Railroad in its annual report to the stockholders on January 1 , 1852 , made its first reference to the telegraph . The report of the superintendent of transportation , H. Haupt , suggests how tentative was the relation of the electric wire to their road at that time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to equip the engines to meet the rigors of winter , irregularities had occurred from circumstances beyond his control . Such interruptions were to be expected , explained the superintendent , since any delay to a passenger train was necessarily extended throughout the entire extent of the single-track line . This difficulty , he asserted , was " greatly aggravated by the fact that . . . express passenger trains pass over the road in both directions at night , when the telegraph line is not in operation , and when no information can be obtained of the relative positions of trains running in constant expectation of meeting . " 19 While the telegraph had been of some value , apparently it had not yet proved itself sufficiently indispensable to warrant the necessary increase in operating costs to maintain day and night service . When Andrew Carnegie went to work for the road as a clerk and telegraph operator in 1853 , he found that no one but the superintendent was permitted to give a train order on any part of the Pennsylvania . It was considered a dangerous expedient to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management was still in its infancy , and men had not yet been trained for it.20 4 .... GRADUALLY the advocates of a railroad-telegraph alliance began to overcome the opposition of conservative railway managements . In a circular letter dated July 1852 , Henry O'Rielly tried to show the many benefits which a railroad might enjoy through the use of telegraphic facilities . " The necessity for increased safety in conjunc- // tion with the increased speed in Railroad traveling , as well as the general convenience of transacting business among employees along railroad routes , should turn Public Attention promptly and strongly upon the vast importance of Telegraphic facilities in connection with Railroad operations , " explained O'Rielly . A " well-arranged telegraph for railroad purposes , would , each and every year , render sufficient benefits to counter-balance the whole cost of construction . " 21 By the mid-fifties the enlightenment campaign of O'Rielly , Minot , and others began to bear fruit . Indifference and hostility slowly gave way , and one railroad after another turned to the telegraph for aid . Noting the trend , the Racine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electro-magnetic telegraph is beginning to be applied . . . to facilitating the operations of railways ; securing greater safety by obviating the danger of collision , accidents and so forth . " 22 Notwithstanding the favorable publicity and a growing interest in the telegraph , a reporter for the London Quarterly Review in 1854 declared , " The telegraph is rarely seen in America running beside the railway , for what reason we do not know ; the consequence , however , is that locomotion in the United States is vastly more dangerous than in England . " 23 Of such common occurrence were railroad accidents in New York , for example , that the legislature felt obliged to set up a commission to investigate the cause and make recommendations for improvement . In connection with the latter objective the New York State engineer , John T. Clark , reported at length on the telegraph system in use on the Erie Railroad in 1855 . " The telegraph has been in use on the Erie since 1852 , " the report began . " It has saved more than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erie 's railway telegraph system then followed . There was an operator , so placed that he had a fair view of the track , at every station on the line , and at the important ones , day and night . He was required to note the exact time of the arrival , departure , or passage of every train , and to transmit this information by telegraph to the proper officer . On each division there was an officer called the train dispatcher , whose duty it was to keep constantly before him a memorandum of the position of every // train upon his division , as ascertained by the telegraphic reports from the several stations . The trains were run upon the Erie by printed time-tables and in accordance with carefully drawn regulations . When they became disarranged for any reason the telegraph was used to disentangle and move them forward . When trains upon any part of the Erie were delayed , the fact was immediately communicated to the nearest station , from which point it was telegraphed to every station on the road . Approaching trains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When trains had been delayed or their operating schedule deranged , the dispatcher was authorized to move them forward by telegraph according to accepted rules and regulations . Having before him a time schedule , he could ascertain the position of each train at any desired moment with sufficient accuracy to determine the best means of advancing the delayed trains and of regulating the movement of all so as to avoid collision or further entanglement . If a passenger train was delayed for an hour or more , the freight trains held up by it were moved forward by telegraphic orders . In this way railway service was greatly accelerated and substantial savings were effected in the utilization of rolling stock.24 New York State engineer Clark 's report left little doubt that he regarded the telegraph as absolutely essential in the safe and efficient operation of a railroad . By 1855 the advantages of a railway telegraph system were becoming too obvious to be ignored by the railroads any longer.25 In his report to the Erie directors for that year , D. C. McCallum , successor to Charles Minot as superintendent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuade some of the more prosaic members of his hoard who regarded the telegraph as an unnecessary expense and a foible of the administration , McCallum declared : " A single track railroad may be rendered more safe and efficient by a proper use of the telegraph than a double track railroad without its aid . . . . It would occupy too much space , " he went on , " to allude to all the practical purposes to which the telegraph is applied in working the road ; and it may suffice to say that without it , the business could not be conducted with anything like the same degree of economy , safety , regularity , or dispatch.126 // McCallum 's report spread far beyond the narrow confines of the Erie management . His words were carefully weighed in railroad circles , and leading companies began to see the telegraph in a new light . During the next decade and a half the use of the telegraph became almost universal , and some of the most perplexing problems of railway operation were solved . By the close of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clime " made manifold use of the telegraph . Its weather reports aided officials in guarding against danger from approaching storms . By giving prompt warning of damage by wind or flood , it prevented disaster in many ways . It moved trains promptly and safely and practically doubled the capacity of every single-track road . It brought the most distant stations and diverse patrons of the company into close relationship with the management , and united the officers and employees of a great railroad system into one compact and wellorganized army . It transmitted observatory standard time automatically to every station at the same instant . It gave steady employment to thousands of persons . All this , and much more , was done by the railway telegraph at a cost of less than 3 percent of the total expense of the operation and maintenance of the railway . The railway telegraph had , indeed , come into its own ; it had become an absolute necessity for the safe and efficient operation of the railroad.27 5  --  - THE partnership of wire and rail was by no means a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficient operation of the railroad , the reverse was just as true . Telegraph leaders found that lines constructed along railroad rights of way and allied with the railroads by favorable contracts were in such a strong position that rivals could not compete successfully with them . The tremendous advantages to be derived from such an alliance are readily apparent from an ex amination of several typical contracts.28 In general , the terms of t hest. early contracts stipulated that : // 1 . The telegraph company was to furnish the railroad company with a single wire of proper size and quality , and provide Morse instruments at certain specified stations on the line of their road . 2 . The telegraph company was to maintain the main battery for working the wire day and night . 3 . The telegraph company was to keep the wire erected for the railroad company in order , except as otherwise provided . 4 . All receipts for messages at offices opened on the line of the railroad , by either party , were to belong to the telegraph company . 5 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its own agents on its own business . 6 . At all stations in addition to those named , the railroad company was to supply all machinery and local battery . 7 . The railroad company was to instruct its men to watch the line , straighten poles , re-set them when down , mend wires , and report to the telegraph company . 8 . The railroad company was to convey and distribute wire and insulators and all other material free , and also furnish a hand-car for stringing wire . g . The two companies were to reciprocate in the use of wires when those of either were out of order , but the railroad wires were never to be interrupted when sending railroad business . 1o . The railroad company was to transport all instruments , material for repairs , all operators , officers and agents of the telegraph company free of charge when on business of the company , and to furnish and distribute the poles when the line had to be renewed , the telegraph company setting and insulating the line . 11 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and insulating it , and for the necessary instruments , at the rate of thirty dollars per mile . 12 . The railroad company was not to allow any other telegraph company to build a telegraph line upon its property . 13 . Railroad telegraph operators might accept public business at the ordinary tariffs , but should account to the telegraph company for // all receipts . No messages , however , were to be accepted or sent so as to interfere with railroad business . " By means of contracts similar in character to the summary form given above , the railroads obtained the use of telegraph lines which were essential to the efficient operation of their roads , while the telegraph companies were assured of protected routes on terms that amounted to a monopoly . Under this arrangement every railroad depot , at a very small cost to the telegraph company , might be used as a telegraph office merely by installing a set of Morse instruments in a convenient corner . The station agent , having learned to operate a Morse key , became the joint employee of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient time to sell tickets , handle baggage , keep up reports , take and send train orders and commercial business , and perform the other multifarious tasks of a station agent . His was an important function in hundreds of small towns throughout the United States . Obviously telegraph lines built along the public highways could not compete with those operating in conjunction with the railroads , and the telegraph companies enjoying railroad contracts were able to force their rivals from the field.30 Sibley , Wade , Stager , Caton , and numerous other wide-awake telegraph leaders had early become aware of the tremendous power that a series of favorable railroad contracts could give them . Reporting to the stockholders of the Cleveland &; Cincinnati Telegraph Company on January 25 , 1854 , President Jeptha H. Wade had asserted , " I can not urge upon you too strongly the importance of rebuilding , in the most permanent manner , the old line , as fast as the resources of the company will permit , and , when suitable arrangements can be made , to get it on to sic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Western Union Telegraph Company , Wade , along with Anson Stager , entered the field of railroad relationships with striking success . Stager , whose popularity with railroad men gave him ready access to their offices , spent much of his time explain- // ing the value of the telegraph in the operation of a railroad . His personality , coupled with a fair comprehension of the problems of railway management , made him admirably suited to act as contact man for the undertaking ; while Wade with his discerning eve was equally well adapted to meet with applicants and arrange the terms . So well did the work of the one complement that of the other , that the pair as " canvasser and comptroller " of railroad contracts , performed an invaluable service for Western Union.32 It was these railroad contracts , entered into during the 1850 's and 1860 's , which in later years made the position of Western Union almost unassailable . " The negotiating of contracts that would be mutually satisfactory to the managements of the telegraph and the railroad was not easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or the other party from securing some special advantage . In a letter to his business associate , Judge Caton , on January 8 , 186o , Hiram Sibley expressed his concern lest under the existing arrangements some of the railroad telegraph lines might become rivals of the regular telegraph companies . By uniting their lines for railroad business they might gradually become so familiar with the telegraph business and so interested in the profits to be derived from the public business , that they might decide to compete with the regular telegraph companies for it . One of the most threatening combinations of this kind , Sibley told Caton , was the Michigan Central and its extension west to St. Joseph . " It has occurred to me , " he wrote , " that we ought to make some fair arrangement with you to divert the public business from the Hannibal St. Joseph line so as to render the enterprise unprofitable to them . As that line is a pioneer in the enterprise , it becomes important to us all that it should not be successful , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar with the business of that line and quite as likely to appreciate the necessity for some plan to remedy the trouble I apprehend , please think over the suggestion and give us the benefit of your opinion . " 34 Some insight into the methods which Sibley proposed to employ to maintain control of the telegraph industry is provided by this frank statement . . // In spite of rivalries , difficulties and misunderstandings , the relations between wire and rail were gradually adjusted , and the working alliance between them was extended until the railroad and telegraph systems of the continent had become inextricably bound up with one another . From this fusion there emerged strong and aggressive communication and transportation systems which transformed the life of the nation . CHAPTER XIV Rise of the Associated Press MORSE 'S struggle to introduce his invention had been a long and difficult one , but twice , at critical times for the infant telegraph , circumstances had favored it . The first fortuitous event had been the convening of the Democratic National Convention in Baltimore three days after the formal opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outbreak of the Mexican War , less than a month prior to the completion of the first commercial wire in the country . The former incident served to prove the practicability of electrical means of communication ; the latter virtually forced its adoption by the newspaper press . On his last day of office , President Tyler had sent a courier to inform Texas that only her consent was necessary to become the twentyeighth state . Mexico , watching the course of events , informed the United States that the admission of Texas into the Union would be a just cause for war . Attempts to negotiate the outstanding differences with Mexico having failed , on January 13 , 1846 , President Polk had ordered General Zachary Taylor to take up his position on the Rio Grande del Norte . Four months later , on May 13 , 1846 , the two nations were at war . ' News of hostilities stirred the nation . An aroused populace clamored for details of the sharp battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma . The press could not satisfy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war was seven days removed from the eastern seaboard by the fastest government mails , thanks to the " blundering incapacity and ridiculous parsimony " of the Post Office Department . ' Enterprising journalists were challenged to find more rapid means of forwarding their dispatches . Already engaged in costly , competitive news-gathering exploits , the prospect of even greater distances to cover caused concern . Enormous stuns were being spent on pony expresses , special trains , rowboats , and clipper ships . A careful review of the situation convinced editors that some sort of a New York press association was needed . Such a . // body , allied with the leading presses throughout the North and working in conjunction with the journals of New Orleans and the South , might bring a semblance of order in the hitherto chaotic field of news gathering . Motivated by a mutual desire to overtake the United States mail and outstrip competitors , the New York Sun and the Charleston Courier joined forces in 1847 . Early in that year their respective proprietors , Moses Y. Beach and William S. King , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Montgomery . In this way they hoped to cover the distance in onethird of the time normally taken by the stage coaches . More ambitious was the " Great Southern Daily Express " running its sixty-odd ponies between New Orleans and New York for the purpose of bringing the news from the South a day or two in advance of the government mails.3 Most prominent in this grand design were the Baltimore Sun ( Arunah S. Abell ) , the Philadelphia Public Ledger ( William M. Swain ) , and the New York Herald ( James Gordon Bennett ) . In their efforts to get the news to the public promptly , enterprising journalists from the very outbreak of the war had looked hopefully to the infant telegraph . Horace Greeley introduced Tribune readers to a telegraphic column on Tuesday , May 12 , 1846 , with the arresting caption , " 50,000 Volunteers Called For ! $10,000,000 to be Raised . " Columns headed " Latest Intelligence by Mail " were shortly subordinated to " Latest Intelligence by Magnetic Telegraph " in many of the leading journals . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the cost was high . At first only a few papers in each city employed the lines to any material extent.4 The telegraph , for its part , though willing and even anxious to aid in the rapid transmission of war news could be of little help at the outset . On the day of the formal declaration of war , it could boast of no more than 13o miles of wire ; and the battle fronts were some 1,300 miles away . The only telegraph line , besides the experimental line from Baltimore to Washington , was a single wire connecting New York and Philadelphia . Henry O'Rielly was constructing an additional section from Philadelphia to Baltimore but work was seriously hampered for want of funds.s The construction of a great southern trunk line to link Washington and New Oilcans , although the subject of numerous discussions , had not yet been started . Private // enterprise , the Government , and the Eastern press had each been looked to for assistance in the building of such a line , but no satisfactory arrangement had been reached.6 Apart from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night work in so far as it might be necessary , 7 there was little that the telegraph managers could do to aid in the rapid transmission of messages from the theater of the war . James Gordon Bennett , William M. Swain , Horace Greeley , Moses Y. Beach , and other alert publishers were disposed to make what use they could of the fragmentary lines , and asked their immediate extension . A week after the outbreak of war , dispatches were being sent from Washington to Baltimore by telegraph , and thence by special steam and horse express to Wilmington , from which point they were telegraphed to Jersey City.8 Three weeks later on June 7 , 1846 , the Herald told with evident satisfaction of " The First Flash of the Lightning Line " from Washington to New York . " The lightning line from Washington to this city is complete , " wrote the editor , " and we received the first flash ? the first intelligence , at an early hour last evening ? eighteen hours in advance of the mail . The completion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning Herald the interesting intelligence from the Rio Grande , one whole day in advance of the old dog-trot way of receiving news from the South . " 9 Some progress was being made in the race against time . Telegraph lines in the blueprint stage in the summer of 1846 had become realitics by the summer of 1847 . New Orleans was now three days nearer New York . Bennett , a most enthusiastic and faithful chronicler of the " wonderwire , " surveyed its progress for his Herald readers on July 12 , 18.1.7 . " At the present time there are upwards of seven thousand miles of telegraph in operation , and in the course of construction in the United . States and Canada . Lines have recently been constructed extending from Portland . . . to Fredericksburg , and in a week or two ... the telegraph will be in operation as far as Richmond . At the Vest there is a line in operation to Wheeling , and in a very short tinge it will extend to Cincinnati . . . . In the month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mobile and New Orleans , a distance of one hundred and fifty miles . When that line shall have been completed , we will be within three or four days of the latter city by means of the telegraph and our Southern overland express and will receive news from there four days in advance of the mail . A line between Portland and Halifax is about to be constructed . . . by which the foreign markets can be made known throughout the whole country in a few minutes after the arrival of the English Cunard steamships , and which will bring New York , Boston , and the extreme West and South within nine or ten days of England . " 10 By December 1847 , telegraph lines had reached St. Louis ; and in the following July , the New Orleans Picayune was able to announce : " The telegraph communication between this city and New York , and therefore all the North , is completed by way of Montgomery and Augusta . " 11 With the rapid extension of the wires the press came to depend more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Alexander Jones , pioneer in the field of telegraph reporting , first general agent of the Associated Press , and author of an early book on the electro-magnetic telegraph , wrote that " the utility of the telegraph to the press in forwarding army news was such as , in a measure , to force them into its employment . " 12 Frederic Hudson , business manager of the Herald , as if in confirmation , subsequently stated , " With the brilliant conflicts on the Rio Grande the Telegraphic Era of the Press really began . What a commencement ! What a revolution ! " 13 BUT eager as telegraph and press were to collaborate with one another , their early relations were not always pleasant . Inexperienced telegraph operators , inadequate facilities , lack of coordination , high costs of early telegraphing , and ruthless competition for telegraphic service among rival papers made the period 1846-1848 one of great confusion and general dissatisfaction on the part of both industries . The press contended it was trying to adapt itself to a telegraph going through an awkward adolescence ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
