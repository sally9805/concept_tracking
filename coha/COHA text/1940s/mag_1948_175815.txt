The nation 's voters were involved in scores of local election skirmishes last week . Some of them : <P> Ohio 's ex-Governor Frank Lausche ( rhymes with how-she ) , the Democrats ' best vote-getter in the Midwest , returned to the wars . Opposed by the state 's Dem ocratic machine ( including Harry Truman 's new Commerce Secretary , Charles Sawyer ) , he won his gubernatorial primary handily . He will oppose Republican Governor Thomas J. Herbert , who beat him by a whisker in 1946 . <P> Alabama 's Democratic primary voters unseated two Congressmen-Pete Jarman and Carter Manasco-and landed a one-two punch to Harry Truman 's chin . The front-runners in the race for Alabama 's eleven presidential electors were all pledged to vote against Harry Truman or any civil-rights nominee . Of the leaders in the scramble for Alabama 's 26 Democratic convention seats , virtually all were opposed to Truman 's renomination , 13 were pledged to bolt the convention if a civil-rights plank were adopted . <P> In Indiana , young ( 28 ) Philip Willkie stepped onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nomination to the state legislature from Rush and Henry counties ( which have not gone Democratic since the Civil War ) . The magic of the Willkie name helped some ; but the main reason for his nearly 5-to-1 victory over a candidate who had not been defeated in 35 years was his own tireless stumping : 7,800 miles by automobile ; 16 hours a day of doorbell-ringing.
