For the first time the U.S. Government last week officially recognized the production efforts of individual factory workers , handed five Packard Motor Car employes WPB 's newly created award for production short cuts . The Packard Stakhanovites* received almost one-third of all the awards made-got the only award handed to the automobile industry . <P> Behind all this was a classic example of how honest , realistic labor-management cooperation can bolster worker morale and boost production . Packard 's " Work to Win " production drive has boosted production as much as 80% in some departments , has brought in 7,000 worker suggestions on how to increase output . Better still , the scheme has brought Packard labor-management relations to new heights of sweetness &; light . <P> The whole thing started in January when wide-awake , progressive Packard Vice President George T. Christopher began wondering how he could boost output without merely adding more plant or more men . Packard had plenty of war-production experience-it jumped the gun on all other automakers by snagging a British aviation engine contract in 1940 . But its operations still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out endless thousands of Rolls-Royce aircraft engines ( for Curtiss fighters ) and Packard-designed supermarine engines ( for PT boats ) . So Engine-Maker Christopher cooked up a production-boosting plan , based on the idea that : " It must bring in the entire organization . " <P> Enter Labor . Christopher took his plan to stocky , clear-thinking Curt Murdock , president of Packard Local 190 ( U.A.W.-C.I.O. ) , a unioneer who realizes that the only way to win the war is with more and faster production . In a two-month series of confabs , the two men pounded the original idea into the " Work to Win " program . Chief program points : 1 ) a speedup of machines rather than men ; 2 ) individual recognition for work well done ; 3 ) whoop-ups . <P> Since April , George Christopher has been Packard 's president . On May 2 he startled all Detroit , broke the last chunks of labor-management ice with a joint banquet for 800 company officials , union leaders and Army-Navy brass hats . Since then it has been easy . Packard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * paste windshield stickers on their cars . In the rambling Packard plants , huge 15-ft. red , white &; blue billboards blazon new worker-composed slogans each week , twin scoreboards tally each department 's efficiency and production . At plant entrances toy soldiers march across miniature battlefields to show how each division 's record compares with all others . <P> Most productive is the labor-management suggestion committee which scans thousands of ideas from Packard workers . Already 313 suggestions have been put to use in the company 's plants , another 600 are being considered by company engineers . Among the ideas in use is one which combined boring and reaming operations on one machine , thus frees another machine for additional work ; another shifted assembly operations so that nine men and two sets of tools can do certain engine assemblies 50% faster than 14 men with 14 sets of tools .
