During two years of fighting in the Middle East , Major Peter Byers Ascroft , a surgeon with the Eighth Army , and his Scottish surgical unit handled 516 head-wound cases . Last summer Major Ascroft summarized the clinical results of this experience in the British medical journal , The Lancet . Last week the New England Journal of Medicine declared Major Ascroft 's article required reading for every U.S. military and civilian surgeon . Reasons : 1 ) " the conclusions differ so fundamentally from those previously authorized for publication by the U.S. War Department , which were largely reached shortly after World War I " ; 2 ) the article settles a long debate among surgeons about when &; how to deal with compound skull fractures . <P> Most important point in Major Ascroft 's paper : " We believe it is better not to operate in forward areas on patients with head wounds , provided that the patient can reach a fully equipped base hospital within 48 to 72 hours of injury . " This agrees with the late , great Dr. Harvey Cushing 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous than a few more hours of delay . " But Major Ascroft points out that " in this war most casualties have not reached a base hospital under 48 hours or more . " <P> Major Ascroft 's chief reason for operating at a base hospital : there the surgeon can use 1 ) the X-ray ( which is not always available in forward zones ) ; 2 ) a suction apparatus to remove injured brain tissues and debris and an electric cautery to stop bleeding . Neither device is obtainable near a swiftly moving front . <P> Wide-Open Wounds . Major Ascroft finds only three valid reasons for treating head-wound cases at the front : 1 ) severe shock ( but " shock is seldom severe in head wounds " ) , which makes it impossible to move a patient at once ; 2 ) need for immediate surgery to relieve pressure on the brain ; 3 ) no possibility of reaching a base hospital in 72 hours . For such cases he recommends " an operation of expedience " -a cleanup after which the wound is left wide-open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wound may be drawn on the bandage to guide the base-hospital surgeon who completes the operation . <P> Other Ascroft ideas : <P> &gt; " Local anesthesia can be used less often than might be expected ; many patients are too restless , while others have wounds elsewhere unsuitable for local anesthesia . " The alternative is sodium pentothal by vein . <P> &gt; Whenever an X-ray plate or the bone itself shows any sign of damage to the skull 's outer shell , a small , exploratory burr hole should be made at that spot . Reason : a blow which causes a slight bruise on the skull 's outer shell often causes a serious fracture of the inner shell . In one case , where only a threadlike crack showed on the surface , a bit of the skull 's inner shell had been driven almost an inch into the brain .
