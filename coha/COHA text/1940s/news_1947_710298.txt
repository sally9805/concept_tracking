txt FBI HEAD BRANDS COMMUNIST PARTY A ' FIFTH COLUMN ' Allegiance Is to Russia , He Testifies , and Overthrow of  - -  Our Government Is Goal DENNIS CAUSES AN UPROAR General Secretary of Party Defies Efforts to Get His Real Name ' and Is Ejected By SAMUEL A. TOWER Special to TI-E ? New YORK WASHINGTON , March 26 ? J. Edgar Hoover , director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , branded today the American Communist party as a " fifth column if there ever was one " and declared that its " goal is the overthrow of our Government . " He testified before the House Committee on un-American Activities on proposed measures to outlaw the Communist party and expressed " grave doubts as to the wisdom " of such legislation although " not unalterably opposed " to it . Earlier Eugene Dennis , general secretary of the party , who was appearing as a voluntary witness in opposition to the proposals , brought about a scene of confusion and uproar when , having been sworn in , he declined to answer the committee 's first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Subpoena Is Presented Members kept pressing for his name and birthplace . Mr. Dennis insisted that the questions were " irrelevant , incompetent and immaterial . " Amid a babble of voices Robert E. Stripling , the committee 's chief investigator , presented a subpoena to Mr. Dennis . With his long statement unread , Mr. Dennis was then escorted from the room by Capitol police . Mr. Hoover , in the statement he offered , referred to Mr. Dennis as a man of " many aliases " which he listed as follows : Francis Waldron , Francis Xavier Waldron Jr. , Frank Waldron , Eugene Dennis , F. E. W. Dennis , Gene Dennis , Paul Eugene Walsh and " Milton . " The subpoena , requiring Mr. Dennis to return before the committee April 9 , was issued to Eugene Dennis alias Francis Eugene Waldron . Mr. Stripling stated that the latter was his real name and that he was born in Seattle . Mr. Hoover asserted : " There is no doubt as to where // real Communist 's loyalty rests . ' heir allegiance is to Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the committee the epeated modifications of the party ine , which " changes from day to ay , " and illustrated these tactics oy observing that since President 7ruman called for aid to Greece Lnd Turkey the Communists , oplosing the plan , had " been mobilizng , promoting mass meetings , ; ending telegrams and letters to mert pressure on Congress . " Directed " From Paris " In response to a question con:erning integrated international : lommunist activities Mr. Hoover ; tated that " for the last several rears the direction of Communist activities has emanated from Paris , with a direct pipeline to Moscow . " Asserting that the Communist ' fifth column " . was " far better or ; nnized " than those the Nazis had n countries attacked by Germany , ( r . Hoover said that the numeri ; al strength of the party was " in ; ignificant " because " it is the ilaim of the Communists them ; elves that for every party member here are ten others ready , willing and able to do the party 's work . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of enrolled Communist nembers , with 30,000 , followed by California , 8,553 ; Illinois , 6,500 ; Dhio , 3,838 ; Oregon , 3,654 ; Wash.ngton , 2,752 ; New Jersey , 2,487 , and Michigan , 2,135 . " Rather than the size of the Communist party the way to weigh its true importance is by testing its influence , its ability to infiltrate , " he testified , adding that " it Ls well known that there are many actual members who because of their position are not carried on party rolls . " Instead of any course of action which would give the Communists " cause to portray and pity themselves as martyrs , " Mr. Hoover counseled as the " best antidote " ' to the movement " vigorous , intelligent , old-fashioned ' Americanism . " ' " Our most effective defense , " he declared , " is a workable democracy that guarantees and preserves our cherished freedom . " Has ** Statement Mr. Dennis , a heavy-set , younglooking man in his early forties , with a trim mustache , came to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Americans to be Communists . He took the oath with a smile , but his manner changed when he was asked for his real name . " Whether my name is Smith or Jones or Cohen makes no difference , " he asserted , pointing out in a later exchange that he paid taxes under the name of Dennis , that he had a legal right to adopt whatever name he chose and that his name had no bearing upon his testimony . The committee members , pointing out that they were seeking to identify him , sought vainly for response from the witness . Mr. Dennis repeated that he had borne the name for a " great , great many years . " " The committee has considerable testimony as to the name under which he was born , " Mr. Stripling stated . " He was born under another name . I see no reason why he should testify under a phony name . " At another point Mr. Stripling said there was " considerable evidence that Mr. Dennis has used a number of names to procure fraudulent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is testifying . " Mr. Stripling added : " Who will he be tomorrow ? " As voices and emotions rose Representative J. Parnell Thomas , committee chairman , directed the serving of the subpoena and excused the witness . Mr. Stripling , who knifed his ' way through the police surrounding Mr. Dennis , stated that the subpoena had been legally served . Mr. Dennis sought to avoid it and finally brushed it aside to the floor . In the corridor Mr. Dennis challenged the authority of the committee to issue the subpoena for these reasons : the committee 's jurisdiction was undefined by Congress ; the Communist party , not being un-American , did not come in the committee 's province , and the committee was unlawfully constituted with one member , Representative John E. Rankin of Mississippi , having been illegally elected to Congress in violation of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution . The Daughters of the American Revolution , through Mrs. Julius Y. Talmadge , president-general , went on record at the hearing as approving the proposed legislative bans on communism in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it is time to clean house " of " traitors . " Dr. Emerson Schmidt , representing the United States Chamber of Commerce , opposed the legislation on the ground that it " might conceivably give us a false sense of complacency knowing that we have passed a law " and because it would make martyrs of Communists and drive them underground . Warns of Underground Drive Driving the Communist party underground would foster rather than discourage subversive activities , the American Civil Libertiee Union declared yesterday . In a statement adopted by the board of directors and releases through its counsel , Arthur Garfield Hays , the union , which excludes Cortimunists from its boars of directors , said that loose definitions of communism , subversive activity and disloyal.y might be used to suppress sincere liberal thought . It asserted that " to adopt a policy of suppression " was " to practice the very same totalitarian policy we so abhor in communism . " It would be ineffectual to outlaw the party by name , it stated , since it could change its name as it has done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control . " On proposed measures to bar Communist literature from the mails the union took the stand that these constituted " flagrant violations of free speech " and would undoubtedly be held unconstitutional by the courts .
