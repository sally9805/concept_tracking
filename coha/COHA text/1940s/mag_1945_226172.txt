Bulky , bossy Ernest Bevin , British to the bone , considers himself more of a proletarian than Molotov . Last week Laborite Bevin became the first official spokesman of a great power to advocate a world assembly elected directly by the peoples , not appointed by their governments . <P> Bevin 's speech in the House of Commons showed how far Britain had moved from prewar nationalism and imperialism . Britain , said Britain 's Foreign Secretary , was now ready to give up a portion of her sovereignty to such a world parliament , to merge the power of the British people and of the House of Commons " into the greater power " that could guard " the great repositories of science and destruction . . . . " <P> " No Weakening . " Ernie Bevin had sat up all night pondering his speech . He had seized a moment when serious troubles plagued Britain 's foreign spheres . Smartly and swiftly he had picked up a cue dropped by his predecessor , Anthony Eden , in the House of Commons debate the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every succeeding scientific discovery makes greater nonsense of old-time conceptions of sovereignty . " Eden 's counsel : " Abate our present ideas of sovereignty and take the sting out of nationalism . " His conclusion : the veto power of the Big Five of the United Nations Organization 's Security Council should be revised . <P> Bevin went far beyond this cue , but in doing so he gave UNO its strongest stimulant in many months . Bevin insisted that Britain stood wholeheartedly behind the United Nations Organization and would utilize it- " stretch it to the limit of its capacity from the security point of view . " He added : " There must be no weakening of the institutions which were built at San Francisco . " <P> The effect was instantaneous and evidently deep . The packed galleries and M.P.s of all parties roundly cheered Ernie Bevin . Keen , young Michael Foot , Labor 's most pungent pamphleteer , who had also been up all night preparing a blast at Bevin , tore up his manuscript. * Laborites , Tories , Liberals were apparently of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a world afraid of blowing itself to smithereens . The British press showed no excitement . <P> But Politician Bevin did not put all his eggs in one Utopian basket . He well knows that it is the governments of three nations , not the peoples of the world , that hold 90% of the world 's military power ; that the present charter of the United Nations was drafted in painful consciousness of that hard fact . <P> Bevin had his British anchor to windward ; he was firm about Britain 's role in western Europe : " I can not help it if people have groundless suspicion . . . . But I must . . . go on with the task of building up friendship with our immediate neighbors . . . . " <P> <P> * But another blast went off : the British Communist Party demanded that Bevin resign his Cabinet post , charged that his policies toward the Soviet Union and " new peoples ' governments of Europe " were merely a continuation of Tory policies .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
