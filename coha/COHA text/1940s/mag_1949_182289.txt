Into the depot at Aurora , Ill. last week glided a diesel locomotive with two spanking new streamlined , bubble-domed coaches . Out of one stepped Ralph Budd , 69 , the highballing president of the Chicago , Burlington &; Quincy Railroad , who had done more than any other railroader to make such dream trains a reality . <P> Ralph Budd had come to Aurora , the " Q 's " birthplace , to celebrate the road 's first 100 years . He donned a claw hammer coat and stovepipe hat , glued on a black mustache , and helped re-enact the granting of the Q 's 1849 charter for its first twelve miles of track . But Budd , whose 10,600-mile railroad system is now the U.S. 's fourth longest , * had his eye , as usual , on the future . <P> Next month , Budd told his Aurora hosts , the Burlington will introduce its " Vista Dome " double-deck coaches on the Chicago-San Francisco run , with six new streamliners costing about $15 million . The Q can not compete , timewise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shorter route . So Budd shrewdly decided , by use of the Vista Dome , to " sell the breath-taking scenery " of the road 's route through the Colorado Rockies and California 's Feather River Canyon . <P> Improve the Service . For Budd , such up &; coming railroading was a matter of habit . An Iowa farm boy trained as a civil engineer , he began railroading at 20 on the Chicago Great Western . After a spell of work on the Panama Canal , he became an assistant to Empire Builder Jim Hill on the Great Northern . In 1919 , a few years after Hill 's death , Budd , at 40 , stepped into Hill 's job . <P> Budd spent $240 million improving the service . In 1930 , as a sort of busman 's holiday , he took on a job for the Soviet Union . He inspected its 4,800 miles of badly managed railways and recommended ways of improving them . In 1932 , Budd stepped into the Burlington ( jointly owned by Hill 's Great Northern and the Northern Pacific ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obey the Rules . Budd rescued the Burlington , chiefly by foreseeing the revolutionary potential of the diesel engine . His Pioneer Zephyr ( 1934 ) was the first diesel-powered streamliner. * <P> It proved so successful that Budd dieselized his entire run as fast as he could plow back earnings ( now diesels power 80% of the Q 's passenger miles , 50% of its freight ) . The big diesel payoff came in freight . Because of the easier maintenance of diesels , Budd stepped up the Burlington 's freight car mileage to 62.7 miles a day by 1947 ( v. a national average of 47.6 ) . And the Burlington 's net rose last year to an estimated $28 million . <P> Other railroaders call Budd " the presidents ' president " because such big wheels as the Rock Island 's President John Farrington , Santa Fe 's President Fred Gurley and the Great Northern 's President Frank Gavin are Budd-trained men . Soon a protege will succeed him . Next August , Ralph Budd will be 70 - and the Burlington has an inflexible rule that its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention of breaking the rule : he made it . <P> <P> * The longest systems : Santa Fe , Southern Pacific , New York Central . * It and the new streamliners were built by Philadelphia 's Budd Co. , headed by Edward G. Budd Jr. , no kin .
