txt Work of The Lighthouse PHILIP S. PLATT , pg . 20 Letters to The Times Work of The Lighthouse To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : For many years , at this time , you have graciously printed a letter from The Lighthouse of the New York Association for the Blind . Then brief messages to your readers have touched on the valiant struggle for independence , self-sufficiency and normal acceptance by the sighted on the part of some 4,000 blind whom we serve . With 42 per cent of these blind of working age gainfully employed , the old conception of the " helpless blind " must be abandoned along with so many of the popular misconceptions about the blind . But this fine achievement has not come without great effort by the blind , nor , usually , without long periods of encouragement and practical help from such agencies as The Lighthouse . For forty years The Lighthouse has been strengthening and broadening its foursided program of adjustment , training , job placement and life enrichment through all manner of recreational activities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $378,000 last . year , the public contributed $210,000 . Like all welfare agencies that strive to improve the quality of their work , The Lighthouse finds that its services this year will cost more . We earnestly appeal to your readers to help us continue our work for the blind . A visit to The Lighthouse is always welcomed . PHILIP S. PLATT , Executive Director . New York , Feb. 25 , 1947.
