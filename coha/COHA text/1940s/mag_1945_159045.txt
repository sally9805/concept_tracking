" People ask me offhand to explain to them ' all about this modern art . ' They want the answer in a series of pat phrases between drinks . But . . . unless you state your thesis clearly-from the ground up , you are simply adding to the sum of confusion on the subject . " So writes Minnesota-born Abstractionist Hilaire Hiler in his new book , Why Abstract ? ( New Directions , $2.50 ) . <P> Like many of his kind , Abstractionist Hilaire Hiler ( rhymes with kill-care smiler ) writes more understandably than he paints . Besides teaching himself to paint .

He believes that color photography has ended the day for " representational " painting . He sees the artist of the future as a " color consultant , color engineer , and industrial designer .
