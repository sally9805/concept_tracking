How grave was Britain 's economic sickness ? Did the realization that Britain must sharply reduce her Empire commitments and step down as a first-rate power also mean that Britain at home could never recover ? <P> This week the United Kingdom buckled down to work again . After three fuelless weeks , factories in the London area and the northwest could resume operations , but home use was still curtailed . Snow and ice were thawing , coal moving . Brewers were resuming beer production . Britons felt a little better . <P> The deeper sickness remained . The Crisis had upset the rhythm of production ; the emptied industrial pipelines would be gurgling for many a month . Real recovery might not get started until midsummer , and that is when Britain must build up coal stocks for another winter . In consequence , the vital exports program may be affected right to the end of 1947 . <P> Act of Faith . The temperature of The Crisis patient was charted in Britain 's dwindling dollar holdings and in her trade balance ( TIME , Feb. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had bet wrong on a shortage in coal might not also bet wrong on a shortage in dollars . Would Chancellor of the Exchequer Hugh Dalton suddenly appear in Fuel Minister Emanuel Shinwell 's calamitous role ? Or would the Government , now alert to dangers , try to save dollars by restrictions on such comparative luxuries as U.S. cigarets , Hollywood films , Texas grapefruit and dried eggs ? <P> The British Government knows that more &; more restriction is not the answer to its trade problem . On April 8 , when Britain sits down at Geneva with the U.S. and 16 other nations to talk tariffs , the British are prepared to make an act of faith . They may surprise other delegates by offering to abandon a big part of the Empire preference system in return for tariff concessions in the hard-money countries , particularly the U.S. <P> Reasons for Hope . But in the long run , the British trade position depended on whether Britons can overcome industrial production difficulties at home . Last week John Osborne , TIME 'S London bureau chief , set himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the task of finding Britain 's essential strengths and its valid hopes of survival and recovery . Osborne reported : <P> " The problem can be solved ; it is not hopeless . Raggedly and slowly , but surely , the country 's human and material resources are being mobilized . That is an enormous gain ; The Crisis which ended Britain 's short , uneasy sleep would not have come if that had been true last year . <P> " Britain has a lot of industrial know-how . Americans who think they have a national copyright on that term would do well to abandon the illusion . Britain has tangible industrial resources . Not all plants are worn out . Not all management is behind the times . Britain is not literally broke . <P> " The British spirit could slough into disastrous quiescence and defeatism . Britain can not work out of its sore trouble unless the people give up much of the little they now have , but they have great capacity to do without .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
