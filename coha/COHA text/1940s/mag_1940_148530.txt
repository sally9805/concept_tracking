Zanzibar ( Universal ) , from the studio which recently gave the world Green Hell , is one of the funniest pictures ever made in all seriousness . Fun begins when Lola Lane ( a lion huntress ) becomes involved in a struggle to the death between the British Empire and Eduardo Ciannelli . Miss Lane is pro-British . She and Mr. Ciannelli both have orders to steal the skull of a former African chief , Mkwawa ( pronounced McVava ) . <P> Grim note is struck when Mr. Ciannelli is suspected of murdering the skipper of Miss Lane 's animal freighter . He might have saved himself the trouble : the ship immediately founders . But first all the animals escape . The sight of the well-trained lions and leopards leaping gracefully into a boiling ocean is one long to be remembered . <P> Miss Lane escapes too . Inhumanely dislodging a lion from her lifeboat , she reaches shore . But so do Mr. Ciannelli , the lions and the leopards . They track Miss Lane , pausing only to devour two of her party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tucked away ( in a volcano ) . Next day with the help of the Sultan ( who has a strong German accent ) Miss Lane traps enough animals to stock a zoo . It does her no good because Mr. Ciannelli lets them all out again the same night . There is another bedlam of leaping lions , snarling leopards , flitting hyenas . By the time she gets them back in their cages , Miss Lane is all primed to go skull hunting . Then the Sultan takes her and her friends into protective custody . <P> In the nick of time , James Craig lets the animals out all over again . Miss Lane gets the skull when the volcano erupts , explodes and buries Mr. Ciannelli . Says Tom Fadden , patting the skull as Miss Lane and he drop leisurely downstream a few minutes later : " Old fellow , when we get back from this , you and I are going on a two-week bender.
