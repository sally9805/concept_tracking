txt Smaller manufacturers of New England have in general obtained less defense business than they should and less than many people realize , Edward V. Hickey , Manager for New England of the District of Contract Distribution of the Office of Production Management , declared here today . " The Government 's program of all-out production for defense means a revolution in production , " said Mr. Hickey , whose chief job is to get defense contracts into the hands of small plants . " In a revolution can you go on as you have been doing ? Do n't you need drastically to readjust your frame of mind , your view of the future and your plans to keep in step with constantly changing trends ? " If you take out the Fore River Shipyard of Bethlehem Steel , the Pratt &; Whitney airplane engine plant add Electric Boat of Connecticut , the General Electric plants in Massachusetts , the navy yards and the army arsenals , the Bath Iron Works , which is building ships in Maine , etc .. you lift a big piece out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " How many of the smaller people of New England have gotten into defense work ? " Mr. Hickey was asked . " We ca n't say what percentage or number of the small men are getting into this , " he replied , " but we can say the fault may not be wholly theirs . " Yet to a certain extent they are responsible because of not using their initiative in a new and highly competitive situation . " If gold should be discovered in Melrose on the outskirts of Boston , ' you can imagine the crowds flocking there . " Somewhat similarly we have in defense business a big production area and a lot of people piling in to get orders . Locally the competition is pretty strong , and from outside this region other concerns are rushing in here seeking subcontracIa . Information Wanted " Not a day goes by but we receive letters about the possibilities of contracts from companies in // Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner . By a Staff Correspondent of The Christian Science Monitor WASHINGTON , Sept. 25 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , , speaking as a friend , not as an opponent of the Administration 's war measures , reported to , the Senate today that discrimination in the letting of defense contracts was not only wrecking small business but is gravely retarding the whole defense program . " Small business enterprises have been discriminated against right and left , " the Senator declared . He attributed Ahis discrimination 1,0 the influence of " big business dollar-a-year men in control of the defense program . " The Office of Production Management does not assent to Senator Murray 's charge of deliberate discrimination but apparently does not deny that small business has not received either its fair or most efficient share of defense contracts . At least the immediate objective of Floyd B. Odium , new director of OPM 's Contracts Distribution Division , is to rectify this situation . Today he placed in the hands of 56 of the bigger corporations a letter asking each of them to appoint its " ablest executive " to head the company 's subcontracting service and plans are under way to expand the present 30 OPM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr , Odium is also working to see that raw material shortages i handicap the smaller non-defense industries as little as possible . . As chairman of the Senate 's special committee to study problems of American small business , Senator Murray asked for the allocation of $1,000,000 to carry on the committee 's investigation . " The administration cf our defense program , " Senator Murray told the Senate , " has become extremely muddled . This must be promptly remedied if the defense program is to be effective , The Congress has voted billions of dollars for defense funds to arm the Nation against the Nazi menace to wo , rld peace : but big business dollar-a-year men , drawing huge salaries from private corporations , have moved into control of the defense commission , and made it a sort of badge of honor for big busines . " A campaign is now on to enormously expand the plant capacity of big business . This means that big business will further monopolize defense contracts at a time when small plants all over the country find themselves in a desperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up because of lack of materials for their regular civilian production or their inability to secure any defense contracts . ' Break ' Not Expected " It is only natural to expect that the dollar-a-year men in the Defense Commission and at the head of its various agencies can not avoid favoritism toward big business , with which they have had long , close and friendly contact . Certainly small business could not expect to get an even break under such circumstances . " Now that big business has walked off with the major part of the defense orders , the story is being circulated that small busi- nessmen are inefficient and a re-I distribution of defense business 1 to small enterprises would cost : the taxpayer millions of dollars in higher costs to the Government . This is pure , unadulterated , big business propaganda . " I have been insisting from the very beginning that small businessmen should be represented in the national defense agencies by bona fide small businessmen speaking the language of small business and interested in the preservation of small business . Late Start Made " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Floyd Odium , known as the Division of Contract Distribution . This agencyl is designed to correct these condi- , tiOns . Thus , a very late start is now being made in this serious situation and conditions are bound to get much worse before Mr. Odlum can even make a start to remedy matters . Senator Murray urged that in order to allow the small plants of the country to participate in the defense program , the big contracts now tied up with large concerns , i which can not be put into production , be split up among small plants ' wherever possible and future contracts should be allotted tinder conditions requiring splitting . This , he explained , is necessary " if the panic now in the offing is to be avoided . " He held that there can be no justification for the further expansion of big business while small business is being threatened with idleness and possible extinction , Rubber Restriction Cited The Senator cited one illustra1 tion of discrimination against small business as a type of thing which should be corrected . The period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reserve Corporation , he said , was very injurious to the small manufacturers and retailers in this industry and most favorable to the four major manufacturers , three of whom own crude rubber plantations and have undoubtedly profited enormously from the increased price of raw rubber . The small enterprises in this industry , according to the Montana Senator , are principally dependent upon the manufacturing and sale of tires and tubes . The four major firms not only own plants in many foreign countries from which they derive revenue , but they also have obtained large defense contracts from our Government and in addition own and operate fabric mills , cotton plantations , coal mines and several thousand retail stores in which are sold , besides tires and tubes , everything from gasoline and oil products to radios , lawn mowers , ice boxes and sporting goods .
