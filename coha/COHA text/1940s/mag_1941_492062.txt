In 1933 , Jo Carstairs found herself in Miami , bored and on the loose . She had turned her back on racing , which had cost her some $50,000 a year and almost her life . England , too , had seen the last of her ; as a British resident citizen , she found that paying English and American taxes on her U. S. securities threatened to put her permanently in debt to both governments . One day , listlessly turning the pages of a Miami newspaper , THE SIITURD.Ry EVENING POST 11 an item in small type struck her eye . " Island for Sale , " it read , " 8 by 16 miles of tropical paradise . " Jo had never owned an island ; she pictured a lotus land dripping gardenias . The price , .40,000 , seemed modest enough , and within the week she held title . What Marion Carstairs actually acquired was eight by sixteen miles of scrubby wasteland , a dilapidated lighthouse , and a tropical bungalow perfectly tailored to a Somerset Maugham beachcomber . The island , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had left it severely alone for thirteen years . It was the depth of the rainy season . Deposited on a sand bank , she waded ashore and found herself peering through a slashing downpour at an expanse of wind-whipped scrub ; no hibiscus-hung pathways inviting to discovery ; no natives chanting glad cries of welcome . The sole inhabitants were a man and his wife , who were supposed to look after the lighthouse , although they never could bring themselves to climb the hill in a storm . It was in the bungalow with them that Jo dug in . Under the circumstances , there was n't much to do but sit around and watch the rain come through the slats . Today , for beauty , Whale Cay could rival any setting concocted for Dorothy Lamour . Three thousand coconut palms wave in the breeze , oleander bushes cling to walls and fences , almond trees shade stretches of lawn . But , though it looks like a dream of paradise , Whale Cay is no place for lotus eaters.sand , adds to her seeming youthfulness ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jo Carstairs knew nothing about land development eight years ago , but she learned fast . Her first move was to import seven laborers and an architect from Nassau to build her a house . Incapable of sharing authority , she promptly fired the architect . " He had to many ideas , " Jo explained . Since then she has made the concession of taking on a manager , whose job it is to take care of the hooks . Under her direction , the building went up in a month  --  a sturdy piece of tropical Spanish architecture . Rubble mixed with limestone , steel to rib the three-foot-thick walls , and mahogany  --  stout as a ship 's bulkhead and warmly polished  --  for doors and paneling , are calculated to give time and the elements a run for their money . Jo chose the site on which it stands because of a riot of tamarind trees then in bloom ; it is a source of wry mirth to her that they have never bloomed since . Taming a Tropic Isle THAT house was the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to date , has cost three hundred thousand dollars . The Bahamian government now considers it a port of entry requiring a customs official . Jo 's lands now include , besides Whale Cay , three smaller islands  --  Bird Cay , Devil 's Cay , Hoffman Cay  --  also : 150 acres of Andros Island , beaches along the shore line , and plans to dig out a yacht basin . As she sees it , there is nothing to stop her from making Whale Cay and its subsidiaries completely selfcontained , and already they are more so than any other island in the Bahamas . The exorbitant cost of importing foodstuffs started Jo on her agricultural experiment  --  an experiment which may prove a shot in the arm to the distressed Bahamas . The wind-swept islands heretofore have thwarted the beet-laid plans of highpowered development companies sent out from time to time by Great Britain . Covering the calcareous rock is an unresponsive residue ; in times past it produced a sparse crop of tomatoes , avocados , oranges , pineapples and lemons . Jo Carstairs describes her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Whale Cay 's soil was found to be particularly lacking in potash and organic elements , but after numerous futile experiments , Jo hit on humus , and the earth began to give in . Natural irrigation was not possible , so every eave , roof gutter and funnel drains into large cisterns and the water is hoarded for the fields . Periodically she makes the rounds in search of new terrain for planting and , finding a spot sufficiently sheltered from the wind , gives urders to start a farm . Today , several hundred of Whale Cay 's thousands of acres are under cultivation , with more in preparation , and all the vegetables consumed on the island are home-grown . When Jo put down corn , the Bahamians scoffed ; later Jo ate the corn and Broad clearings under cultivation push back the scrub ; gleaming limestone houses , newly whitewashed , dot the landscape ; and fourteen miles of smooth white roads stretch away in all directions . From sunup to sundown , Jo roars along these roads on her motor bike , going about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a great knife at her belt , she looks Ince a cross between an amiable pirate and Peter Pan . She has the tautness of a runner about to take off . Her brown eyes , tilted at the corners , give her candid face an unexpected piquancy . Short-cropped hair , sun-streaked to the color of Project has followed project , with more and more workers called for , until the population has swelled to 500 and requires forty cottages and two dormitories to house it . A wireless station and powerhouse , a store , a school and a church have been built . A granary , the largest in the Bahamas , was recently completed . Supplies are brought over by the Vergemere IV , a motor barge built on the island and designed by Jo herself , that plies between Miami , Nassau and Whale Cay . It also brings over mail and an occasional guest . Doing duty as a dredge is the Vergemere III , an exrumrunner , with which Jo has developed seventhey their words . Asparagus , beets , celery , carrots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as citrus fruits , cantaloupes and bananas . Jo converted her swampy acres on near-by Andros into rice fields , and impatiently wonders why no one ever tried it before . The Bahamas have a vague idea that Marion Carstairs is " growing something over there . " They are more informed about that part of her work involving the Negroes . Word has gone out that on Whale Cay a man has a good berth and a chance to make something of himself ; Continued on Page 113 ) " This is it , Bill , " Dewey said quietly . " This is what I 've been after . " " You 've got your rat poison ? " Zia asked . " Sure I 've got it . Chorny proved it for me ! " He set his cup down and spoke thoughtfully . " Grow the grass out here , extract the juice and ship it across for treatment . I can manufacture this anywhere , anyplace ! " He stared at the cup while they watched him , then a sudden thought came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I can go back home ! " His tone was awed . He looked at them , but he did not really see them . " I 've got my dope , and that 's what I came for ! " His voice rose , finding life . " When the rains stop , I can go home ! " He moved sharply to the door and stood staring out . They heard him laugh as he gazed across the post toif he 's willing  --  a state of affairs that does not exist on the other islands . Constituting two thirds of the population , the Bahamian Negroes formerly scraped along on a pittance from the sisal  --  hemp  --  and sponge industries . and it was a labor setup that had long been a sore point to social-minded observers . At sea for weeks at a time , the sponge divers were herded into old fishing schooners along with the livestock carried for provisions . In Nassau , the sight of the boats pulling out , their ancient sails leaning to the wind , was undeniably picturesque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began t o fail , partly as a result of a sponge disease , and partly because of the uprooting of entire beds by overzealous divers . Simultaneously a blight descended on the sisal plants , and hundreds more Negroes were cut off from a livelihood . Since then they have picked up what they can from the tourist trade and , for the rest , live a sprawling existence in their nine-to-a-room huts , well out of sight of Nassau 's carriage trade . Whale Cay and the other Carstairs possessions have been the first large-scale move toward opening a new way of life for these Negroes . Besides offering well-organized employment under salutary living conditions , Jo provides an opportunity for ( THE END ) learning a trade  --  boatbuilding , cabinetmaking , road construction , and the like . Her pioneering may prove that all the islands can he made self - sustaining , which is why Bahamian authorities have been watching her efforts with keen interest . This past December , when the Duke of Windsor discussed with President Roosevelt the immediate prospects for the Bahamas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibitive cost of living . Exports amount , roughly , to $700,000 a year , with imports at $4,110,000 ? the hulk of these coming from the P. S. at a ratio of : I to I. The duke 's hope seemed to be that interested Americans might he induced to finance agricultural enterprises in the islands , which might seem overoptimistic at any time , to say nothing of the present . Jo Canstairs has already attacked t he specific problems he was discussing . even to the extent of organizing the young Negro workers , something that Windsor appeared eager to further when he asked to visit our CCC camps . Two years ago Jo set up a League Colored Youth on Whale Cay designe.i to give the young Negro a sense of group identity and art incentive to a I , - complishmmt. movement wat gaining impetus when , due to lack o ! co-operation on the part oi the authorities , Jo decided it was wiser to curtail it for the time being . The Duke of Windsor visited Whale Cay last month . In taking on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The man who presents a testimonial signed by his local priest handicaps himself from the start . " I would n't care if a letter were signed by the Angel Gabriel , " she says . " I can size them up for myself . " She stands for no nonsense from anyone in her employ , and when her directions miscarry she gives the culprit his comeuppance with a loud indifference to diplomacy . Typically short-tempered , her anger does not last . Recently , when her manager and long-time associate failed to send the supply boat off to Miami at the appointed hour , it , corralled him in the kitchen and told him off , to the edification of the listening household . He heard her out for ten minutes and then regarded her thoughtfully . " Tell me , Jo , " he asked wonderingly , " how did they ever let you out of heaven ? " Jo laughed ; the storm was over . Jo 's reputation for fair play is such that natives write from as far off as Haiti applying for jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no birds of passage , and encourages the natives , if they 're married , to bring their families . As these have increased , the boss decided the children should have a good start . She built a schoolhouse which she put in charge of an educated Negro . His salary comes from Jo 's pocket , as does that of the island 's Anglican pastor , Father Henshaw . Between religious duties . Father Henshaw takes on some of the more advanced students , and recently brought one youth through Caesar 's Gallic Wars . Neither he nor Jo would exchange that pupil for a dozen Rhodes scholars . Young Father Henshaw is as enthusiastic about Jo 's island adventure as Jo herself , and would rather work with his Bahamian natives than lie called to the highest diocese in the empire . Jo built the chapel two years ago on the highest point of the island . The diminutive church looks like the kind of place into which Hansel and Gretel might stray . The exquisitely wrought stained glass was designed in England by Alice Laughlin and assembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altar of mahogany was copied from the one on the S. S. Normandie . Jo thought it one of the loveliest she had ever seen . Sunday service is an event that no Negro would miss . The men turn out polished and dressed to the eyes , and the women and children are starched and beribboned . At the service itself they are hearty worshipers , and the responses , for rapidity and volume , often threaten to leave Father Renshaw behind . .11 One-Woman Government She maintains a well-equipped dispensary for cut feet , sprained ankles and toothaches . A nurse , whom Jo had trained in Nassau , is always in attendance . Jo herself is an able assistant and the whale administrative health department . Venereal diseases , long a neglected problem among the Bahamian Negroes , have been controlled on her island , with physical examinations a periodic requirement . Illegitimacy is coped with by ruling that a man either marries the girl or is banished from the island . in became a Bahamian citizen some years ago and , although ultimately responsible to the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onewoman government . Along with being the legislator of rules , she is judge and jury for infractions of them . Misdemeanors bring down one of two sentences : a reduction in wages for petty offenses , and , for serious ones , banishment . Where a legal offense is involved , such as theft , the culprit is turned over to the Bahamian courts . A minimum of policing is carried out by four of the natives , who patrol the island in night and day shifts . Besides Jo herself , they are the wily persons in possession of firearms . Even her regiment is unarmed . She has outfitted these ninety-eight of the island 's sturdiest sons with khaki uniforms and shiny nickel-plated staves , which they shoulder as pridefully as bayonet-fixed rifles . Jo has great regard for discipline , and instituted the troop as one more moral bracer for her Negroes . They take to it joyfully , though as drillmaster , she handles them with a Spartan technique . On a hot day when the sand flies were biting the men 's hare legs mercilessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ranks . Jo eyed them scornfully . " Look here , " she rapped out . " You 're not to stir even if a Bengal tiger snaps at your ankles . Get it ? " From Whale Cay 's store the Negroes get . all their supplies , from overalls to canned soups . The weekly pay-off takes place at the store every Saturday night . Jo is the paymaster , and perched on a high stool , moneybags to hand , she has a personal word for each man . She knows each Negro by name , and his family as well . For the first six weeks she pays in produce ; after that , wages average four American dollars a week . Their wages pocketed , the natives make use of the evening in the same way that workers the world over make use of it for stepping out . The place of entertainment is a social hall that Jo built . Although the boss allows nothing stronger than beer un the island , there are times when beerbottles can fly . On such occasions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melee of boisterous Negroes to confront the troublemakers . Drawing herself up to her full five feet two inches , she demands , " Now then , what 's going on here ? " Last year , on one particularly riotous night , Jo was not notified . The next day 150 Negroes got their permanent walking papers --  the boss . orders . Next to the store , Jo gets her higgest kick out of the museum , which she designed herself . It looks like a frosted cupcake , and houses her racing trophies , along with items that have caught her fancy from time to time : the appendix of her second mate , a flag that once belonged to the Emperor Maximilian , a shark she captured in Nassau harbor by dangling a piece of fried chicken over the side . The museum is Jo 's memory book . Her great disappointment is that somehow her mother 's necklace of dried ears got mislaid . Het mother received it from a grateful African soldier whom she had nursed in the last war . Estelle Bostwick , incidentally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gangrene . In fact , her whole career had more than enough in it to account for the active life of her daughter Marion , Estelle Bostwick had four husbands ; the third one , the gland expert , Dr. Serge Woronoff . She was a prominent exhibitor in horse shows , and took part in Continental sailing races . She was herself disinherited , but her mother relented after M r . Bostwick 's death . Estelle Bostwick in turn disinherited Jo for what she considered her daughter 's fitful way of living , but the two of them made up shortly before the older woman 's death . Jo thinks that the dried ears would have complemented her collection of spears , daggers , javelins and knives picked up in remote corners of the world . Two panther skins decorate one of the walls ; Jo shot them in Thun at a distance of twenty-five yards . Less ornamental , but more prized , is the brown mongrel pet dog that Jo had stuffed when he died . She often threatens to have her manager stuffed on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Tod Wadley occupies the place of honor . A sixteen-inch doll , he was Jo 's racing mascot , and became almost as well known in England as Jo herself . She has had him sculptured in bronze and placed in a specially built niche . The original still goes everywhere with her , dressed in whatever costume the occasion requires . Tod Wadley even has a dinner jacket , and his own miniature note paper with his crest . One time in London a man rang the bell of her Mulberry Walk house and inquired if his lordship was in . " You see , " he explained , " I was in his regiment in France . " All Jo Carstairs ' racing trophies were stolen from the London house , and it took two years to replace them . The shining facsimiles that now repose in the museum represent $2000 garnered from an insurance company as well as ten crowded years of Jo 's life . Her interest in racing began in 1923 , when she purchased a cutter , already named the Sonia , which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a virtual standstill . Jo reluctantly solved the problem by destroying the boat in an elaborate ceremony and turned to speedboats . In I. 1929 , with a number of prizes to her credit , she announced she would go to America as British challenger for the Harmsworth Trophy . In September , Jo found herself aboard the Berengaria , a ship on which she traveled so much that one of its officials finally offered it to her , she says . Jo 's present cruiser , the Berania , is named after the Berengaria . Neptune 's Daughter America gave Britain 's twentyeight-year-old " queen of speed ' ? often miscalled " Betty , " a name she detests  --  a royal welcome . Her Napierengined Estelle H named after her mother  --  was promptly described as " a baby contending with Amazons . " it , She was twenty-one feet long , and ? weighed under a ton , as against the 4000-pound boats of Alec Johnson , Ralph Snoddy and Gar Wood . Two hundred and fifty thousand spectators on the banks of the Detroit River watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three Americans , and cheered wildly as she and Gar Wood roared along , nose to nose , for the first two miles . It looked as if the race would he a photo finish between the English girl and the champion , when , suddenly , the Estelle II leaped into the air , turned turtle and sank . Pinned behind the wheel , Marion Carstairs vanished with her boat , plunging downward forty feet into a tar bank . Luckily , the Estelle then fell apart . Stitching had been used to hold her together , on the assumption it was stronger than nails , and the , , stitching gave way . Freed , Jo found ' herself catapulted to the surface , and her first action was to insist that her mechanic , who had been thrown clear , be picked up first , as he seemed to be hurt . She herself emerged from the Detroit River with sinus trouble and two broken ribs . Wood 's boat , Miss America VII , won the race easily , and established a record at ninety-two miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back again with the Estelle IV  --  there was no Estelle III and the following year , 1930 , she challenged Wood 's supremacy for the third and last time with the Estelles IV and V. She never defeated him , but he always knew he had been in a race . Jo reached the top of her racing career in 1930 , when she captured thello Duke of York International Trophy in England . The next year she and the Estelle IV broke the sea-mile record ( Continued on Page 116 ( Continued from Puge 114 ) for the Motorboat Challenge Cup at 83.61 knots ; 105 miles an hour is the fastest she has ever traveled in a speedboat . The Estelle IV is now a dredge on Whale Cay , but Jo gets a dreamy look now and then when someone brings up her racing . " Give me two Rolls Royce engines , and I 'd be off again tomorrow , " she sometimes says . " And Gar and I would kill each other , " she adds , by way of sentimentalizing over the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jo has unbounded admiration . She championed Wood loudly in his row with Kaye Don , although Don , at the time , was her successor as British challenger . By starting before the gun , Wood tricked Don into following him , with the result that both boats were immediately disqualified , while Wood 's second boat , driven by his brother , waited for the gun and rounded the course unchallenged . Jo declared that Wood 's ruse was all part of the game . Private Paradise T. E. Lawrence is another of her heroes , and it is her great regret that it was Gertrude Bell rather than Marion Carstairs who helped him build Iraq . Jo herself was once described as " a girl T. E. Lawrence . " She holds Malcolm Campbell in the same regard as Lawrence , and put up $25,000 to help finance Campbell 's run at Daytona Beach in 1930 , when the newly reconditioned Blue Bird swept across the sands at 300 miles an hour . It is a perpetual source of amusement to her that , according to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old woman . " Malcolm Campbell is a welcome guest at Whale Cay , and usually makes a visit there at least once a year . A few other friends of long standing make up one of the world 's shortest guest lists . For instance , it was only after eight years of dutifully inspecting the Whale Cay lighthouse , in accordance with government regulations , that Commander Langton-Jones , of His Majesty 's navy , retired , was finally invited for a cup of tea . According to one story , Jo is supposed to have hurled a knife at Father Henshaw on his arrival , mistaking him for an intruder ; she missed his ear by inches , they will tell you . The tale is an injustice to Jo 's marksmanship  --  she once successfully speared a moving snake at some distance  --  but it hardly exaggerates her attitude toward intrusion . If a vessel is forced to seek haven on her shores , its occupants are not urged to make themselves at home ; and if drastic repairs are essential , she wastes no time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat away . Mere her privacy is concerned , acts of God cut no ice with her . Once , when four young men managed conveniently to ground themselves on one of the beaches , the occasion provided diversion for the entire population of Whale Cay . At least that 's how Jo describes the affair . The young men , on the other hand , reported that a fierce band of painted savages swarmed out of the jungle to meet them , and ransacked their ship , uttering strange cries . Jo is very proud of that idea and the speed with which she carried it out . She decorated some of her Negroes with cold cream , equipped them with arms snatched from the museum , and led them herself , brandishing a gigantic cutlass . It cleared the island . Jo is likely to practice tomfoolery on anyone , anywhere , any time . When John , Lord Bishop of Nassau , came to dedicate the chapel , he was subjected to a series of pistol shots fired outside his window at one in the morning . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostess ' admiration . Taking a Whale Cay joke on the chin is essential to being invited again . Pranks are a form of dissipation with Jo , who never drinks . The guest who has visualized a procession of Negroes hearing tall , cool rum punches , is in for a surprise . II he wants a drink , he can pour himself one from the solitary bottle of Scotch that is kept in the kitchen . If he wants to know how to behave in the guest rooms , he can read the following whimsical instructions : NOTICE TO GUESTS A. Use light switch only when standing on rubber mat provided . B. All visitors wishing morning tea in their rooms will be dealt with accordingly . C. It is desirable for guests to sleep under the beds , as the management can not be held responsible for any detrimental inconsistencies therein . D. Any olive pits , razor blades , safetydeposit boxes , or Winchell columns left in beds only confuse the staff . E. Ignore calendar . The management does not coincide with anniversaries . F. Anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have their bicycles confiscated . ( Discrepancies may be committed , but not condoned . ) Jo goes in for great simplicity of living : whitewashed walls , a huge fireplace flanked by enormous stones , ships ' lanterns instead of lights , and a bare floor of Cuban tiles give her living room style , but not luxury . Four Negro househoys whom she took off road building and a male cook make up her staff . Meals are plain and wholesome . Jo hates bells , and , when it 's time for plates to be removed , lets out a cry of " Ir-r-win ! " that could bring him from Trinidad , She is up at seven and out around the island by eight . With indifference to the traditions of the tropics , she has installed a siren that goes off at noon . It is the signal for the Negroes to leave off work and fall to munching their sandwiches , while the boss herself returns to the house to a lunch of grapefruit , usually eaten standing up ; she rarely sits down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's off . Watching her leap on her red motor hike and roar out the gate , Father Henshaw has often uttered a silent prayer . The bike was a Christmas present to Jo from her white employees , who have since wondered about the wisdom of their gift . The boss drives a car backwards faster than most people do forward and often contributes to the glee of the Negroes by giving them a lift . " Climb on , fellows , " she calls out as she passes her workers on the road . Riding with the boss is considered a great treat . She drives with great skill , most of the time with one hand on the wheel . In England , she once lost her license for three years for speeding , but the cop who arrested her begged her for the opportunity to drive with her sometime . She loved driving in France with its many villages and tortuous streets . Rushing at a particularly narrow passage , she was constantly startling the townspeople by shouting , " Here we go , threading the needle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which she uses mainly for taking her to one of her seven beaches .. Fond of swimming , she rarely misses ' her four-o'clock dip . The beaches all have names , such as Ma Sue , Atlantic , Thunder Beach , Lighthouse Beach . She observes the British tradition of evening formality by changing to crisplooking slacks and having dinner at nine . After dinner , if there are guests , she is likely to suggest a game of Chinese checkers , which she invariably wins . No money is involved , as she has never cared for gambling , although once at Hialeah she was unable to resist betting ten dollars on a horse called " Whale . " which came in first , netting her $600 . What Jo enjoys most in her leisure time on the island is making phonograph records . Wisely sticking to melodrama , the Whale Cay players have concocted a number of lurid tale , . which include such sound effects as to noise of men jumping out of windows , a clock ticking in a deathhouse , and the like . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A Royal Progress During July and August , she shuts down as far as work on Whale Cay is concerned . The heat then is intense , and Jo gives her workers a vacation . She herself leaves the island to take a look at the world , and keeps a twelveyear-old Rolls in Miami for that purpose . Named " Atlanta " and painted liberally with silver A 's , it has been known to make the MiamiNew York trip in thirty hours flat , and once it beat the train . Jo designed the bod ' . herself . Before the war she used to take a flying trip abroad to revisit her old haunts  --  Paris , the Riviera , London . Now she takes her annual junket to New York , where , in six weeks , she figures on absorbing enough city life to last her a year . She takes a suite at one of the best hotels , goes to shows avidly , inspects the night clubs , and gives one large cocktail party . She goes on a vigorous round of shopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run the gamut of her Whale Cay wardrobe . For a week she surrenders herself to the stores and a favorite beauty parlor , which turns her out coifed , manicured and discreetly made up . The restlessness , howeveif remains , and at parties , penned in a room , Jo prowls . She spends her days seeing to business affairs . Her finances are handled by a prominent New York law firm , and she enjoys putting in long hours in their offices . While in New York Jo communicates by wire , daily and at length , with Whale Cay . It 's a good guess that the high point of her vacation is the day when Atlanta pulls up to the hotel door , the luggage is piled on and Jo gets behind the wheel . GI like an Indianapolis road-race entry , Marion Car-stairs , exrolling stone , is headed for " home . "
