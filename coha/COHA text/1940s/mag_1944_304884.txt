Another Russian campaign pushed through to victory . Last week on the shores of the Baltic it partially destroyed two German Armies ( the 16th and 18th ) , and even better to the Russians-it secured the Baltic States for Russia . <P> Marshal Leonid A. Govorov 's Leningrad army , fresh from its triumph over the Finns in Karelia , swept across Estonia . Its left flank drove through from the southern end of Lake Peipus . Its right flank drove through the lake-studded swamps bordering the Gulf of Finland . At a mile-an-hour clip , this force rolled into Tallinn , last but one of the occupied capitals ( according to Soviet reckoning ) of the Soviet republics. * <P> Down Go the Ships . With Govorov 's southern flank cutting toward the coast south of Tallinn , the Nazis took to the sea to escape . Many of the scratch fleet of evacuation ships were sunk by Red Fleet aircraft before they got to sea . The seizure of Tallinn ( directly opposite Helsinki ) was a great naval victory , for it pave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after three years ' virtual blockade , a chance to operate in the Baltic . The Red Fleet seized the opportunity at once , and landed marines who captured Paldiski , west of Tallinn . <P> While Govorov 's army was wringing the last of the Nazis out of the northernmost of the Baltic States , the Second and Third Baltic Armies , directly to the south , drove through Latvia to squeeze the Germans against the Gulf of Riga . To close the trap , the First Baltic Army swung north to take Riga at the bottom of the Gulf . <P> But there was still fight left in the Nazis . They concentrated their strength to hold a hedgehog near Jelgava ( Mitau ) and thus kept open a small exit for their troops from the northeast . Even after the capture of Jelgava by tankers of Lieut . General Viktor Obukov , the Germans stood their ground , backed up against the Gulf of Riga . Until the first of this week , an escape corridor was still open , with Nazis streaming through it to fight another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days left to fight outside the borders of the Reich . With Estonia and Latvia going and the larger part of Lithuania already gone , the Red Army would soon ring East Prussia around two-thirds of its perimeter . <P> *Capitals formerly occupied , now freed by the Red Army are : Kiev , Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic , liberated Nov. 6 , 1943 ; Petrozavodsk , Karelo-Finnish S.S.R. , June 19 , 1944 ; Vilna , Lithuanian S.S.R. , July 13 ; Minsk , Belorussian S.S.R. , July 14 ; Kishinev , Moldavian S.S.R. , Aug. 24 ; Tallinn , Estonian S.S.R. , Sept. 22 .
