Public Address System A Story by Jessamyn West NUMBER of people are blaming Bill Hare for what happened to Leonard Hobart . They say he 's responsible . Bill Hare does n't have to depend upon hearsay for this information . He 's president of the Tenant Building and Loan Association and is in his office on the main street of town eight hours a day . That 's a public place , every Tom , Dick , and Harry feels free to go in  --  and does . They go in  --  Bill has n't any way of telling a client from a busybody since they look pretty much the same and often times are  --  and say , " Bill Hare , do n't your conscience hurt you the way this Leonard Hobart business has turned out ? " It does n't . But Bill is getting tired of saying so . He 'll say something else soon . Mrs. Hobart comes oftenest . She 'll say , " Mister Hare , " ? when Nadine Hobart says a word she says all the letters ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 hold you personally responsible for what happened to my husband . " She came in yesterday . " Mister Hare , " she said , " I place the blame for what happened to Leonard squarely upon your shoulders . " Bill Hare will take a good deal from Nadine Hobart because of what she 's been through , But not everything . He watches her tear-shaped specs tremble on her fleshy nose and notes the way she builds her braids up into a kind of stockade on top of her head and remembers a few of the things Leonard told him about his wife . He thinks , Mrs. Hobart , you 're a good-looking woman and you 've been through a lot , but you keep nagging me and I 'll tell you the truth . I 'll tell you for one thing that you 're responsible , far more responsible for what happened to your husband than I am . From first to last what Bill Hare did , was done to help Leonard . He was more Quixotic than anything else  --  had far more to gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to do : that is , go into Los Angeles and buy it a public address system of a Los Angeles firm . But no . Not fair minded Billy ! " We must play ball with the local merchants , " he told them . " We must give Leonard Hobart his chance . " And since Bill Hare was chairman of the committee to buy the public address system he was naturally listened to . " You mean Hobart 's Electric Shop ? " asked Aldo Mattutzi . Bill said he did . " Why waste time on Old Leonard ? " asked Aldo . " I move we go right into L.A. where we can see the stuff at its source and in quantity . " " No sir , " said Bill Hare . " The success of softball in Tenant depends upon the good will of the townspeople . We 've got to play ball with them if we want them to play ball with us . " " Oh hell ! " said Aldo . " In the first place Leonard probably do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he does and we bypass him he 'll be the last person to raise a squawk . " " Mattutzi , " Bill said reasonably , " you know that 's not the way to handle this . " " Hobart 's your next door neighbor , is n't he ? " Aldo asked , insinuating that Bill 's rea-sons for going to Hobart 's might be personal . " He is , " Bill said . " I 've lived next door to Leonard Hobart for ten years but as far as I 'm concerned he 'd just as well not be there . " That was the truth . And it was n't because Bill Hare was a big wheel in Tenant and Leonard Hobart a practically invisible cog . It was the truth because of time and silence and Nadine . Time : twenty-four hours in the day ; eight or ten for business . Eight for sleep . Six left for his family ( Bill has a wife and three children ) , for softball , for taking a drive , for tuberous begonians , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any time for Leonard ? Silence : Leonard was silent . Not even his shoes squeaked . In a room full of furniture he looked like furniture , When he was outdoors he appeared somewhat leafy . Leonard was a vacation for the eye and for the ear an intermission . Nadine : Bill heard her . In the morning he heard her tell Leonard which tie to put on . At lunch she told him what groceries to pick up on his way home . At night she reminded him to wash his hands before he ate . " As far as I 'm concerned , " he told the committee , " Leonard does n't exist . And if he has n't got what we want I 'll be the first to say let 's go in to Los Angeles . But we ought to see him first and find out what he does have . " Bill naturally was given this job . T EONARD had a small shop , dark , and crowded with radios . Amidst them he J seemed somewhat varnish-colored him-self . Bill looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , finally , at the back of the shop taking the insides out of somebody 's portable . " Hi , Leonard , " he said . Bill saw Leonard look up , then quickly look downward , pretend in fact that he had not seen him nor heard his greeting . Bill walked down the narrow alley way between radios to the back of the shop . Unconsciously he kept step to " Doing What Comes Naturally , " sung by The Nightingales . That 's a chorus of twenty girls and one of the radios was tuned in on their program . " Hi , Leonard ! " he called again . But still Leonard did n't reply . Arrived at Leonard 's work bench he said , " Hard at it , eh ? " Leonard then looked up . " Good morning , MAGAZINE Mr. Hare , " he said . " Radio 's making such a racket I did n't hear you come in . " That was a lie . Bill knew it , then ; and afterward Leonard told him so . Afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you first came into the shop ? " he asked Bill , afterward . Bill did n't very well . " Yeh , I guess so , " he said . " I resented you that day , Bill . " " Resented me ? I was just a poor customer . " Leonard disregarded this . " You were a big wheel in Tenant , Bill . And you had lived beside me for ten years and paid no more attention to me than if I were a stray dog . " Afterward , Leonard could say things like that to Bill and laugh . They were friends then and Leonard could tell Bill things he had never told any one else and in most of what he had to say Bill was interested . " I thought to myself when you walked in that first morning , " Leonard said , " here comes Bill Hare who 'll expect me to drop everything the minute he says , Hi , Leonard . " Bill laughed . " Why hell , Leonard , did n't you want to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a pleasure to make you say Hi twice , to get my attention . " Leonard did n't have any trouble making the sale . He could get the softball committee just as good a public address system as any Los Angeles firm and he quoted them an even better price . Bill placed the order with him then and there , Leonard agreeing , of course , k to install the system at the softball field . Leonard was very pleased about the sale . Pleased to have made the acquaintance of Bill Hare and to have the prospect of working with and getting to know the committeemen . He went home happy that evening . He told Bill about it afterward . T WAS raining as Leonard walked home-ward from work , that night , the first rain of the season , a sort of practice downfall , very slow and easy . On the empty lots the summer dust was cratered by the big drops . When the first autumn rain comes down the tiny shreds and particles of a long summer 's grinding , the bits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flakes of tobacco , hairs from bird feathers , horse 's tails , lip-stick brushes , the grape seeds , dried cherry stems , broken off thumb nails , all these things , pulverized , leap upward an inch or so of the earth as the big drops hit them . Leonard watched this happen on his way home that evening . He had done so before , but he had never before had any one to whom he could speak of it . The whole town of Tenant seemed interesting to Leonard as he walked home that evening . First a building , then a vacant lot . Everything mixed . Loops , garlands , tendrils , lamp posts , swinging signs . Foothills at the end of streets . Frequency modulation beneath the lacy pepper boughs , empty bottles glittering in a clump of farewell summer . Beautiful up-hill dream breasts behind the plate glass windows . Busts , he corrected himself . " Does your wife insist on busts ? " he asked Bill . " What ? " asked Bill , who had n't been listening very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Leonard explained . " Sally leaves my vocabulary pretty much alone , " Bill said . Leonard reached his own front porch that night and stood there , reluctant to go in : fall , the first rain , home town , big sate , acquaintances , friends ! Next door was Bill Hare 's house . Bill a neighbor of his , a business associate . A friend ! Leonard closed his hand gently on a spattering of rain drops as if afraid he 'd crush them . Why not go in , he thought , and lead the kind of life you 've always dreamed about ? What kind of a life is that , he asked himself . Why loving , he answered himself , lead a life of loving kindness . He went inside and it seemed possible . Sometimes the furnishings of his living room disturbed him . There was a wicker settee in which the wicker work strands seemed too numerous and to be traveling in too many directions . Sitting across the room from it he would find himself trying to follow one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going . His eyes would hurt with the intensity of his concentration and still the pattern would elude him . One evening , his eyes following , then failing to follow the design of the wicker work in the settee 's arm he had gone over and tried to trace the design with his fingers . Piece out the pattern by touch if sight were not enough . But Nadine had said , " Leonard for heaven 's sake what are you doing ? Creeping around the settee that way . And patting it . " - Patting it ! " he had protested . " I 'm not patting it . I 'm just trying to feel out the pattern . " " Feel out the pattern ? That 's just as bad . What do you want to feel its pattern for ? " " I want to see if it has a pattern . " " Leonard Hobart , " said Nadine , " are you crazy ? " " No , " said Leonard . " No , I do n't think so . " If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaped his eyes . But then he saw and worried about the picture on the wall opposite the settee : the picture of a vast . mid-ocean welter of green-grey swells . At the picture 's lower edge there was one wave , poised , ready to break . Only it never broke . That was the trouble . There it hung , a white lip , threatening but stationary . Once he had run into the dining room to the wall behind the picture . But arrived there he had felt foolish . A painted wave can not be made to break by getting behind it and pushing . Tonight , however , neither the stationary wave nor the wicker work settee troubled him . In fact , he did n't even see them . " Nadine , Nadine , " he called . From the kitchen there came sounds of supper being prepared , but no answer . " Nadine , " he called again , " I 'm home . " Nadine came to the kitchen door , her coronet of braids lustrous and her eye glasses shining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Beautiful evening , warm , with a drizzle of rain . " " What arc you saying ? " Nadine asked . " Raining , " Leonard replied . " Beautiful evening , warm and raining . " " Is it ? " said Nadine . " Well , I wish you 'd speak up , Leonard , so I could hear you the first time . I wear myself out trying to find out what you 're saying . " " And not worth the trouble half the time , " Leonard agreed pleasantly . To this Nadine did not reply , but observing his empty hands she asked , " Where are the rolls ? " " Rolls ! " Leonard exclaimed clapping his hands to his pockets as if they might be there . " Rolls . I Forgot them . Do you need them for supper ? " " Not if you do n't mind stale bread . " " I do n't , " said Leonard turning back toward the living room and the evening paper , but Nadine told him , " Wash your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no time to read . I E WAS first at the table , even so . He and the stuffed pork chops and the creamed celery and the stale bread waited together . The children were not there and Nadine was calling them , calling up the dark stairs to young Nadine , aged sixteen , out into the rainy evening for Tom , aged twelve . Finally they were all at the table and the pork chops were passed , rich little pockets filled with food . Like a squirrel 's cheeks , Leonard thought , then tried not to think as he cut into one . " I had a piece of luck at the store today , " Leonard told his family after the eating had started . Young Nadine turned eagerly to her mother . " Timmy 's coming . I told you he would . I 'll have to have new sandals and a hag to match . " " Who 's Tinimy ? " Tom asked . " You would n't know , dear , " his mother told him . " Bill Hare stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandals I get a new football . Mine leaks so it 's got to be pumped up every five minutes , " Tom said . " Good ! Pump it up every five minutes . You ca n't be kicking it into peoples faces if you 're pumping it up . " " Do your face good to have a ball kicked If " Tom , dear , " said Nadine . " You can have the ball . Now let your sister alone . " " They 're installing a new public address  --  " Leonard began again but Nadine had an idea . " I could dye that scarf for you , " she told her daughter , " so that it would match your sandals and bag . " It was n't until after the children had finished eating that Leonard had a chance to tell his wife about the sale . " You seem pleased , " said Nadine . " I am . Bill could just as easy have gone into L.A. " " So it 's Bill , now . " " Well , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We had a nice chat . I appreciate his swinging the sale to me , " " So he told you that , did he ? " " No , he did n't . But he 's chairman of the committee . And whatever Bill Hare says in this town you can bet goes . " " You do n't think Bill Hare 's thinking about anyone but Bill Hare , do you ? " " What are you driving at , Nadine ? " " Bill Hare 's buying the system of you so he 'll have some one on hand to service it . You 'll take care of it . Gratis , too , or I miss my guess . You 'll spend your summer at the softball park . Any little flutter in the thing and they 'll be calling on you . " " I like baseball , " said Leonard . " That wo n't be much of a hardship . " " Baseball and servicing a public address system arc two different things . You 'll be doing the latter . You mark my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Leonard did spend a good deal of time at the park . And it was n't for him , a hardship . The system did n't go in until just before the opening of the softball season in late May . Leonard not only installed it but he went with Bill and Bill 's committee for a number of nights after it was in to make sure that the loud speakers were exactly where they should be , that the announcer 's booth was properly and handily equipped , the connections dependable and so forth . Leonard was as anxious as Bill that both patrons and players be convinced that nothing out of Los Angeles could have been better . Leonard enjoyed himself on those May evenings . The air was mild and soft . The grass ( the softball diamond is located in Goodman Memorial Park ) after its mowing and watering earlier in the day gave the place a fresh , country smell . Troops of kids followed the committee about ; and in the midst of all the technical talk Leonard was the authority . Leonard intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening night . He was an enthusiastic baseball fan under any circumstances and with a public address system . of his own installing receiving its first official try-out , he could not have been kept away . The game  --  the Tenant All Stars were playing the San Benito Champs  --  was not scheduled to begin until eight o'clock but Leonard planned to be at the field by seven-thirty . At six-thirty , however , Bill Hare stopped in to ask Leonard to ride down to the park with him . " I thought it might be a smart idea to go down early and make a few tests , " Bill said . " Just be certain everything 's clicking . " ' The I lobarts were still at the dinner table and Nadine , at this request of Bill 's , gave her husband a look which said plainly enough , What did I tell you ? Bill caught the look and asked Nadine somewhat apologetically if she 'd like to ride to the game a little later with his wife . " Thank you . no , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little outside my province . " When Bill and Leonard reached the diamond Bill said , " Maybe Burt 's already here . If he is we 'll get hint to call out a few over the loud speaker . just to sec if she 's still got the power . " B lilt ! ' GAS NOR was the ; 10114 ) 111-leer for the evening , a professional from Los Angeles hired to add eclat to the opening game . Biz ! Burt had n't showed up yet , so Bill told Leonard , " Ill go out in the stands . You go up there and give her a try-out . Say the multiplication table if you want to . It do n't matter what you say . " Bill still had the idea , at that time , that Leonard was a silent man for the lack of anything to say . Later , he realized , of course , that Leonard had been a silent man for the lack of any one to listen to him . Bill walked up into the stands at the southwest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be bad and waited for Leonard 's voice . What he expected to hear was , " One ? two  --  three  --  testing . " Instead , what he heard was , " Tonight , ladies and gentlemen , the Tenant All Stars , play the San Benito Champs in what promises to he a sizzling spine-tingling history making softball classic . While we 're waiting for the teams to put in their appearance on the field let me tell you something about the players . " On the mound for the Tenant All Stars will he Al Tuck , big two hundred pound side-wheeler . Al 's a spot pitcher , the boy who holds the league record for strike outs , a . outhpaw who 's got control as well as steam . ive Al a low ball hitter and boom , upstairs he old apple conies . A high ball hitter and t 's down in the basement . " Bill stopped , turned around , faced the announcer 's booth . He stood stock still . squinting across the twilit diamond , as the talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was saying so much  --  that was the spiel of a man who knew the Tenant team , all right , but who had read more baseball than he 'd played  --  it was Leonard 's voice that impressed . Bill . The voice of Leonard , the silent man . It had the authority of a natural phenomenon : of a cataract , or a thunderstorm , or a glacier , Bill climbed quickly down from the grand stand , then ran back across the field to the announcer 's booth . He felt very excited , somehow . A FTER the game Bill took Leonard home . ( The All Stars had won , Al Tuck , the spot pitcher , holding the Champs to six hits , one run . ) They talked about Burt Gaynor , the announcer for the evening , who had not arrived until the fourth inning , and who had then been incompetent . " Burt would 've done a lot better , " Leonard defended him , " if he had n't been nerv-ous . " " Nervous , " said Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A cop stopped him in Belvedere Gardens on suspicion of drunk driving . It upset him . " " Suspicion ! " Bill exclaimed . " Well , I 'm glad he was stopped . Five innings were more than enough for Burt . " " I thought he got better as he went along , " Leonard said . " As it wore off . " " Look , Leonard , " said Bill . " Burt Gaynor is no problem to softball in Tenant . Drunk or sober . You know that . Tenant got itself a new announcer tonight . " To this Leonard said nothing . It was eleven o'clock and in about half the houses they were passing the lights were still on , and in half of these the blinds were up so that they could see what was going on inside . " Lots of card players , " observed Leonard . There were . Tables of four , two men and two women for the most part . High school girls slamming cards at each other in a violent game of double Canfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of a deck to the bottom . The wanted card never seeming to turn up . " Lots of hair combers , " said Leonard . One hair washer . A man painting the ceil-98 BIARPER 'S ing of his kitchen . A woman ironing . A boy cleaning a rifle . " You know who he is , do n't you ? " Bill persisted . " Our new announcer ? " They passed more card players , hair combers , workers , talkers , lovers . - You 'd want the job , would n't you , Leon-ard ? " Leonard replied reluctantly , as if . talk might make the whole evening fade out like a dream . " My voice was quite a surprise to me , Bill , " he said . " Me too , " Bill replied . " I 'm not used to having people listen to me . " " How 'd it seem , Leonard ? " Bill asked . Leonard tried to say . Out there , far out in the field his voice echoing against the stands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face him . Drowning out lesser sounds : birds , wind in the park 's trees , a kid 's crying . His voice : the breath out of his own lungs , the vibrations given his breath by his own muscles . A part of him going where he could not go , doing what he could not do . " Why , it 's power , " he told Bill . " Sure , it is , " Bill said , smiling . Then he had an idea . They had stopped at Leonard 's place and Bill could see Nadine silhouetted against an upstairs window . " Maybe you 'd like to talk this over with Nadine before you commit yourself to the job . " " No , " Leonard said . " There 's no need to do that . I 'll accept it right now . " A s THE season went on Leonard 's announcing got even better . Not his voice . That could n't be improved , but his manner and what he had to say . There was talk of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bill was naturally proud of him and when softball fans dropped into the Building and Loan office to hash over the games , Bill would tell them the story of Leonard 's debut as a broadcaster and of the part he had played in it . " 1 lived next him for ten years , " he would tell his listeners , " and I never heard him speak . Did n't know if he could speak . Now listen to him . " Every one marveled at Bill 's astuteness in discovering in such unlikely material a soft-MAGAZINE ball announcer , and Bill was willing to accept a fair share of the credit for Leonard 's success . Then , when the criticism began to come in he had to accept his share in that , too . It was natural that it should come to him , since he had been chairman of the committee that bought the public ' address system . The criticism , at first , was unorganized and sporadic and Bill paid little attention to it . Then Mrs. Florence Delia came to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neighborhood Association and as such came bearing an official protest . To her , Bill listened . He sat her down as formally as if she had been a stockholder , folded his hands on his desk and gave her his undivided attention . " What 's on your mind , Mrs. Delia ? " he asked . Mrs. Delia had several things on her mind . First of all she wanted Mr. Hare to know that the Neighborhood Association enjoyed the softball games . They enjoyed the broadcasts . They were proud of the Tenant All Stars . They were proud of Leonard 's success as an announcer . Only , and here Mrs. Delia was both firm and warm as only an Italian matron can be , there was too much of it . " At six o'clock , two hours before a game starts Mr. Hobart is out there at the field yelling balls and strikes , " Mrs. Delia said . " Even when there is to be no game at all he does this . We are no longer able to hear ourselves think in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very fine , big beautiful voice , but we are getting too much of it . " Bill had heard all this before . He had even heard it Leonard 's practicing , Leonard 's voice carrying as it did . He knew he would have to put a stop to it sometime and meanwhile he tried to placate Mrs. Delia and defend his prot  --  g ? . " Mrs. Delia , " he said , " you can understand that a man needs to practice , ca n't you ? Mr. Hobart is new at broadcasting . Its only natural that he should feel the need of practicing . " " He practices at the top of his voice , " protested Mrs. Delia . " He makes the china rattle on our shelves . That is not natural , Mr. Hare . " Bill tried another tack . " Mrs. Delia , you are an Italian and you Italians understand artists . Your Caruso  --  for instance  --  rehearse , rehearse . Is n't that true ? " " Our Caruso , " Mrs. Delia said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant thing to listen to , Mr. Hare . " Bill Hare is an honest man . " I agree with you , Mrs. Delia , " he said . " I 'll speak to Mr. Hobart about it . I 'll put a stop to it . " This was all Mrs. Delia asked . She left Bill with some compliments for Leonard 's regular broadcasts . " Those we enjoy , " she said . " It sounds like something very great going on when Mr. Hobart broadcasts . It makes my spine tingle like the late war and the sadness of good men dying . " This confused Bill but he said , " Thank you . Thank you , Mrs. Delia . I understand how you feel . I 'll see Mr. Hobart at once . " By at once Bill had meant in a day or two . But he went to see Leonard that very afternoon , for hard on Mrs. Delia 's heels came Nadine Hobart . She would neither sit , shake hands , nor speak of the weather . She was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to say was painful to her . " Mr. Hare , " she said , " you are breaking up my marriage . " Bill was aghast . The last thing in the world he would willingly do was to interfere in anyway with Nadine Hobart 's marriage . " Mrs. Hobart , " he faltered , " what do you mean ? " " Leonard , " she said . " Before you got him started in this broadcasting business he was a good husband . Punctual , sympathetic , helpful . Now all that is changed . And above all Leonard is never at home any more Broadcasting or practicing to broadcast ! You must have heard him . " " Yes , " said Bill , " I have . " " Well , " said Mrs. Hobart , " put a stop to it . Besides my personal situation the neighbors are complaining . " " I know , " said Charlie . " To me , too . " " You 're responsible for it Mr. Hare . " " I 'll do what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can ? You started it . Now you stop it . " B ILL closed his office about four that afternoon and went around to Hobart's. - Electric Shop to have a talk with Leonard . Leonard , as on the first time he had called , was at the back of his shop doing some repair work . But this time he replied at once to Bill 's , " Hi , Leonard . " " Hi , Bill , " he said , put down his work and came to meet his friend . " What 's new , Billy-boy ? " he asked . " Well , Leonard , " said Bill , without any beating about the bush , " we 've been getting some complaints about the broadcasts . " " You mean about the practice broadcasts , do n't you ? " " Yes , " said Bill . " About the practices . The Goodman Park Neighborhood Association objects . " " Well , that 's all . fixed up , Billy , " Leonard said . " I was going to tell you . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a public address system of my own . " Bill pushed his hat to the back of his head , then took it off . " At your house ? " he asked , " or the shop ? " " My house . It 's already arrived . I 'll connect it up this evening . It 's a thing I 've had in mind to do for some time . It 'll be a great help to Nadine for one thing , calling the kids into meals and so Forth . And I 'll find uses for it , too no doubt . I 've discovered that I enjoy using the darned thing , believe it or not . Over the public address system , I do n't mind admitting to you , Bill , I feel like a different person . Amplification  --  well , I do n't know  --  it just seems to suit me , some how . " " Are you planning to practice your broadcasts at home ? " Bill asked doubtfully . " I was n't . " Leonard said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of had the idea that my softball technique was okay now . " " I think so , too , " Bill said heartily . " Rehearse and you 're liable to go stale . The broadcasts are just about perfect as they now stand . " " Perfect ! They 're not perfect yet by a long shot , " Leonard said , " but I have noticed one interesting development in them recently . " " What 's that ? " Bill asked . " I do n't know just what to call it  --  anticipation 's maybe the word . " " Anticipation ? " Bill repeated . " Most announcers call out the plays a little after they 're made , do n't they ? " " Sure . " " I call them a little before . " " You what ? " Leonard repeated tidal he had said . " I call them a little before they 're made , Billy . Have n't you noticed it ? " " No , " said Bill . " I have n't . " " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , probably , I call ball and after I say it , the pitch turns out to he a ball . Inside curve , low , I say , and inside curve , low , it is . You 've never noticed ? " " No , " said Bill , never have . " " Watch tomorrow night 's game , Billy . You 'll see what I mean . They move when I give them the word . Not vice versa as with other announcers . It 'll be an added attraction , when people catch on . " B IL , felt uneasy and embarrassed . He knew Leonard was full of whimsies , he liked it in him , but , this seemed carry-Mg a whimsy pretty far . He left Leonard and went immediately home . He had no appetite , that evening and could n't keep his mind on what his wife said . There was an old hollow feeling under his breast bone , not quite a pain , but unpleasant enough to send him to bed as soon as dinner was over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over from the twin bed next his and grasped his arm . " Bill , " she said , shaking his arm , " Bill . What in the world is that noise ? " " What 's what ? " Bill asked , only partially awake . " That sound . What is it ? " It seemed to Bill more like a subterranean force than a sound . It was strong enough to be felt in vibrations along the head board of his bed , against which he had pushed his shoulders in his hurried wakening . Then he realized what it was . " It 's Leonard , " he said . " He was going to install a public address system at his place this evening . He 's resting it . " " Go on back to sleep , Nadine , " Leonard said , the words issuing from the Hobart house like thunderclaps . " Why is he shouting ? " Sally Hare asked . " Why does n't he turn it down ? " " I 'm not shouting , " said Leonard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . " At that Sally scurried over into Bill 's bed . There was something frightening about that voice in the middle of the night , the more MAGAZINE frightening because the voice was Leonard 's . It suggested that there was no more dependence to be put on reason . It was not reasonable for such a sound to issue from Leonard Hobart 's mouth . So quiet a man , " I guess he does n't realize how much he 's being amplified , " Bill said . " Does n't he realize it 's the middle of the night , either ? " Sally asked . " I do n't believe time means much to Leonard , " Bill said . N ExT evening Bill went early to the soft- ball field . It was Saturday , the sixteenth of August , a warm , still night . Although it was a half hour before game time the stands were already three-fourths filled and Leonard was in the midst of his regular pre-game talks . Listening to him Bill lost all the uneasiness which he had felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and factual , Leonard at his best . And his voice , or the voice which was the union of Leonard and the amplifying mechanism , it , too , had never been better . " Tonight , friends , " Leonard was saying , " we are to see the play-off for the Tenant softball championship , Elks versus Tavern Keepers . Battery for the Elks will be Kitto and Patrick . Battery for the Tavern Keepers Eby and Eldridge . " Bill , in his seat behind first relaxed completely . I must 've somehow misunderstood Leonard yesterday , he thought as he listened to hint soberly relaying statistics to the crowd : batting averages , gate receipts , league standings . People were still pouring on to the field through the turnstiles and those already ih the stands were discussing the coining game with animation . As one of the persons responsible for softball in Tenant , Bill looked about with pride . After the record-breaking crowds they had had all season they would be able to afford another piece of equipment for the field next year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lines past the turnstiles had dwindled , had ceased to be lines at all . The Elks team was in the field , Kitto their pitcher was warming up and in the announcer 's booth Leonard was telling the fans about Ben Woodford , Tavern right fielder and first man at bat , " Ben 's batting average for the season , " he concluded , " has been .294 , good but not sensational . On deck for the Tavern Keepers is Jim Lazarus . In the hole , Al Bailey . " Kitt() fin ished his warm-up. t he Elk fielders went out deep . for Woodford , when he connected , was known HI take the ball for a ride . Kiwi sent a final toss over to second , the umpire called , " Play ball , " and the game started . Bill settled back to enjoy himself . Kitto was an amusing pitcher to watch , a tall lanky boy with an involved wind-up which took him , at its mid-point right down to the earth . " Here comes the crank-up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game with his Sunday pitch . It 's a fast one , it barely cuts the outside corner of the plate and Big Ben watches it go by . Strike one on Big Ben Woodford . " Ik called chat before the umpire , did n't he ? " Bill 's neighbor. a man in a yellow T-shirt asked him . " I could n't say , " Bill answered . " Did you hear the ump call it ? " the man persisted . " We probably could n't hear the umpire for the loud speaker . He was probably drowned out . " Bill said . " The limp did n't even have his hand up yet , did he ? " " I do n't know , " Bill said uneasily . " I wasn't. watching the ump . " Whatever had happened , the umpire evidently did not object for Leonard 's magnificent commanding voice continued . " Patrick , Elk catcher , is signalling Kitto for a repeat and he gets it , a knee high sizzler right over the plate . Woodford swings but misses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ f tell you ? " Bill 's neighbor asked . Bill said nothing . " Here conies another crank-up , " boomed Leonard , " Big . Benny is going to look this one over . lie does . It 's a fast peg , but it breaks wide . Ball one for Woodford . The count now stands two and one on Woodford , first man up in the first inning of the ball game , Elks versus Tavern Keepers , Elks at bat . " Down on the field inspire and catcher with masks up were having a talk . Kitto trotted off the mound to join them . " limp says In ' wants to call them , " the man in the T-shirt told Bill . Then as the three men resumed ' heir positions lie added , " IImp says he 'll give the announcer one more chance . " " Kitto gets back on the firing line , " Leonard announced to his listeners and Kitto , as if he had received an order , walked slowly back to pitcher 's box . " Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's another fast ball , a hummer dead over the plate but high . Woodford swings , lie really leans on the old stick this time , but he misses . He misses by a mile . That 's three strikes and out for Big Benny Woodford . " 1 N the echo of Leonard 's encompassing voice Woodford swung and connected , drove a liner deep into right field . Tate Pierce fumbled the pick up , finally made it . then in his hurry , over threw . Woodford was safe on first with plenty of margin . Leonard 's amplified voice , mighty and reverberating was undaunted by this fact . As if to compensate for the discrepancy between what had happened and what he had declared would happen , his voice became even louder , even more commanding . it vaulted over the grand stands , spiraled skyward , then hardening in an arc of solid sound settled just above the heads of the spectators , an arc beneath which they all sat , silent and unmoving as prisoners . Bill had never suspected that the mechanism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much power . It  --  or Leonard 's voice amplified by it , not so much split the air with sound as filled it . The voice which had arched above their heads settled lower and lower . It became a yoke on their shoulders , a weight , a gravestone pushing them nearer and nearer the earth . The words Leonard had been saying , " Three strikes and you 're out , " he continued to say . But through repetition the words lost their meaning and finally , as words , they disappeared all together . The sound of Leonard 's voice , amplified , became nothing but power . nothing but brute force . Bill could feel it belaboring him across his shoulders , thundering against his ear drums , and finally , pummelling him inside his head , in the innermost , private and vulnerable recesses of his mind . Bill never knew , no one ever knew , how long it went on nor why they all sat there numb , unmoving for however long it did go on . Bill himself was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the yellow T-shirt . To him Bill whispered  --  it was impossible to shout above the horrible din of that great , amplified voice , the only way to be heard was to get under it ? " The poor fellow is out of his mind . " Together Bill and the man in the yellow T-shirt scrambled down through the crowded stand , then reaching the ground ran at full tilt toward the broadcasting booth . Leonard wept when he was separated from the amplifier . They took him to Norwalk that night . A -r THE time no one blamed Bill for what happened . Now they have begun to talk . They come into the Building and Loan office and say , " Except for you I guess Leonard Hobart would still be here selling radios . " Bill does n't pay much attention to them . Nadine is different . She came in yesterday . She was in again this afternoon . " I hold you responsible for what happened to my husband . " Up to now Bill has listened with patience to these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are responsible for what happened to your husband . " " I ? " Nadine 's usually firm glasses wobble upon her fleshy nose . " I , you , all of us , " says Bill . " But especially you . " " What do you mean , Mr. flare ? " asks Nadine . " Poor Leonard , " Bill says , " we forced him  --  " He begins again . " No one listened to Leonard --  " But suddenly he is tired of explaining . It is useless , he feels to explain anything to anybody  --  particularly to Nadine . " Good day , madam , " he says and walks Nadine right through the doorway of the Building and Loan office and out on to the street . " What do you mean , Mr. Hare ? " insists Nadine but Bill puts plate glass door between them and locks it . " What do you mean , Mr. Hare ? " Bill asks himself , ironically , imitating Nadine 's demanding voice . He walks over to his desk , sits down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his head , his feet on his desk . " What do you mean , Mr. Hare : " he asks himself , but flatly now and without . irony . A Nostromo KATHARINE STRELSKY You in the sunken chartroom , indifferent hosts to the starfish and the pasturing shark , skeletons cradled in seaweed : what are they to you now , the fair summer voyages with sunburnt American girls buying Arabian silver , Montenegrin rugs , white and red coral from Naples , when friendship was sometimes possible , and always love under Arcturus in the scented Ionian midnight ? " Come a chiami ? " ? water fires swirled in the sea lane and the exigent unknown mouth tasted of salt .
