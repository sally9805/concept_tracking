txt A group of underwriters has agreed to write bonds covering the fidelity insurance of partners of member firms of the New York Stock Exchange which do business with the public , it was revealed yesterday by the Exchange 's committee on member firms . committee transmitted to the membership details of the proposed insurance coverage . The plan , which is subject to change , provides that in case a New York Stock Exchange member firm sustains a loss as the result of a dishonest or fraudulent act by one of its partners , the insurance companies will reimburse the firm up to the amount of the bond . It is hoped that , if the plan is approved by members , it may be put into effect by October 1 . Meanwhile giivernors of the Exchange decided at their regular meeting yesterday to take no action at this time with respect to a reduction in the number of memberships as proposed by a special committee representing a forum of members of the Exchange . The proposed indemnity agreement also provides that a member firm so reimbursed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group for such sums received . It will have three months in which to make repayment . Under the- laws of New York State each member of a partnership is responsible for the obligations of the firm and hence individual partners of a. firm also would be personally responsible for repayment to the underwriter . For some months , a special Stock Exchange committee , headed by 3 : Gould Remick of Evans , Stillman &; Co. , in cooperation with a group of insurance underwriters , has been studying the problem of insurance for partners of member firms following the recommendation of the Public Examining Board that some such bonding would be advisable . If the proposed plan is adopted by a. large number of those member firms which do business with the public  --  it is estimated that there are 513 such firms  --  it is not expected that the cost of this insurance would be very large . is known that insurance underwriters handling this type of risk base their premiums on the volume of business done . That the risk would not be large is indicated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base period which insurance underwriters use to determine premiums , the solvency record of Stock Exchange members has been 99.96% . It is contemplated under the bonding proposal that during the three months permitted for repayment by a firm to the underwriters . the funds received from the underwriter would be treated as capital funds of the firm because , until the expiration of three months , repayment for the advance made by the underwriter would not be considered a firm debt . The time limit for repayment might be extended by arrangement with the underwriter . The underwriter 's claims would be subordinate to any other claims on the firm which arose prior to the expiration of the threemonth period . " Thus , " member firms are advised , " in the event that a loss occurs within the terms of the policy , the firm , to the extent of the amount of the policy , will promptly be placed in funds to meet its money obligations including those arising in the loss of customers ' property . " in connection with the disclosure of the plan for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time in Exchange history , it is making a survey of the amount of insurance which member firms carry at present to indemnify them for loss of property in the form of cash or securities . Member firms are being asked to furnish the Stock Exchange by September 15 with a description of the types of losses against which they are insured under blanket bonds , together with the amounts of insurance carried for each type of loss . Report of Seat Committee The report of the forum committee for the retirement of seats , on which the governors of the Exchange yesterday took no action . in part follows : " Your committee has thoroughly investigated the advisability and feasibility of reducing the number of memberships in the Exchange but because of conditions and circumstances over which we have no control , no plan that we can present will be a panacea for our present difficulties . Because of the rapidity of changing conditions not only in our own industry but throughout the entire world which affect the proper functions of the New York Stock Exchange . any plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " After considering numerous plans , the committee presents the following which , in its opinion , can face all of the objections that might be considered . Plan for Seat Retirement Fund 1 . Establish a credit , by means of a loan from the New York Stock Exchange of $500,000 , with the Treasurer of the New York Stock Exchange , to be used as a seat retirement fund . 2 . Sales transactions contribution : ( a ) Contribution to the seat retirement fund monthly of the equivalent , by every . member firm , of the amount sent to the Treasurer of the New York Stock Exchange in payment of the SEC fee ( 1c on each $500 sales value ) : $229.000 ? ( b ) Contribution to the neat retirement fund of 4% of each member 's monthly floor commission bill , which the Stock Clearing Corporation shall collect : $427,000 ? ( c ) Contribution to the seat retirement fund of 4% of each odd-lot associate broker 's floor commission bill , which the oddlot firma shall collect : ? $50,000 , total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No Effect on Finances " The amount of money used from the credit established by the New York Stock Exchange treasurer is to be repaid out of the income from the sales transaction contribution . In this way the plan will not affect the financial status of the New York Stock Exchange , " the committee said . " As seats are purchased , they are , to be retired as active memberships , and such memberships may never be resold except by the vote in approval of a majority of the entire membership of the New York Stock Exchange . " The seat retirement committee shall be composed of five members of the Exchange . at least three of whom shall be members of the Board of Governors . This committee shall have discretionary- powers for the purchase of memberships . ' " It shall be the intial objective of this committee to retire 100 memberships , subsequent action for further continuance of this plan should be left in the hands of the board of governors .
