txt For the first time in his garrulous career , Charlie McCarthy was speechless in the public eye . There was n't even a knotty pine murmur out of him . The most embarrassing 15 minutes of the McCarthy career occurred on the promenade deck of the Swedish-American liner Gripsholm , as the vessel approached Pier 97 , on Aug. 9 . It happened about this way : Charlie was bringing Mr. and Mrs. Edgar Bergen back to the United States after a European visit during which they made a motion picture with a Swedish background . As the Gripsholm came up the harbor , the Bergens and Charlie were engaged in the usual business of being interviewed and posing for photographers . All was going well , with Charlie contributing his own brand ? of " cheesecake " ( not a General Foods product ) and as many of the 1,304 passengers as could crowd into the area enjoying the fun . After that , Mr. Bergen became briefly engaged in making arrangements fox the television cameramen . And then the awful thing happened . Charlie McCarthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was left alone and unattended on the promenade sleek of the Gripsholm . Callously unaware of the ignominy of it all , a photoarapher recorded the moment for history . A few wisps of hair fell down from under his top hat and over his tanned cheek . He sat forward , weary of it all . He was without speech . In fact , he was without Bergen . Wait till " Stinky " Davis hears about this . And Mortimer Snerd . One ca n't help feeling that the miserable incident will be a - natter for some further reflection , for heart-to-heart , man-to-man talks between Mr. Bergen and McCarthy . Somehow , inevitably , it will boil down to a discussion of the . ' weekly allowance . Perhaps Charlie was n't brooding at all in his special tan case . Maybe he was just scheming . J.
