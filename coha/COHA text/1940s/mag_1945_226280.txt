The conscientious objectors who had starved for science were almost up to their old weights last week ; the exhausted ones were rested ; those with lice and the itch were clean and cured . The professors were ready to tell what they had learned from the C.O. guinea pigs who submitted to medical experiments ( TIME , July 30 ) . Some findings : <P> On Fatigue . Twelve volunteer C.O.s were kept awake for 112 hours , in an experiment run by Caltech 's Dr. David Tyler for the OSRD . They lost the use of their higher brain centers first . After 48 hours , they could n't talk straight ; one man could not even remember the name of his college . Another saw stairs and tried to climb them . Physical responses did not slow up so fast . The boys were capable of efficient muscular spurts almost until they dropped , and played a good game of basketball on the fourth day . Efficiency doubled when they used benzedrine and similar drugs . It is a mistake , Dr. Tyler concluded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long grind . They are most effective when a man is already tired . <P> On Starvation . The 34 C.O.s at the University of Minnesota who were put on a concentration-camp diet until they lost 25% of their weight ( not as much as a Belsen inmate but about the average war time civilian weight loss in Holland ) have been better fed for the last four months . During the starving experiment , each got not more than 1,800 calories a day ( normal for the work the boys were doing : 3,200 ) . In their starved condition , even the idealistic C.O.s thought only of themselves . They were irritable , and their weakness was great-a 30 to 40% loss of strength . Their apathy was even greater , so they did not show their anger . They did not even think but preferred to just " sit and stew . " <P> For the fattening-up process , each needed 4,000 calories a day , twice as much as relief agencies allow . ( Buildup diets were very simple and contained only the grain , potatoes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Conclusion of Dr. Ancel Keys , in charge of the experiment ( which was also OSRD-financed ) : " It 's nonsense to think you can starve people and make them believe in the four freedoms at the same time ... To talk about . . . the will of the people when you are n't feeding them is perfect hogwash . " <P> On the Itch . Britain 's Dr. Kenneth Mellanby , a wartime major , settled down with twelve C.O.s in a villa near Sheffield to investigate the itch ( TIME , Nov 12 ) , which has by now spread to well over a million Britons . He found that : 1 ) the incubation period of the disease is weeks , not days , as doctors have always supposed ; 2 ) the best treatment is benzyl benzoate emulsion or sulfur ointment ; 3 ) people develop itch immunity and are not as easy to infect as people who have never had it . By repeatedly having C.O.s don the still-warm , filthy underwear of itchy soldiers , and sleep in dirty , presumably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disinfection of linen does little or no good . Only two caught the itch that way . Transmission is by " close personal contact " or , as one poesy-minded C.O. put it : <P> Recondite research on Sarcoptes <P> Has revealed that infections begin <P> On leave with your wives or your children <P> Or when you are living in sin .
