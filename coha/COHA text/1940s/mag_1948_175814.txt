Before the Wisconsin and Nebraska primaries , admirers of Tom Dewey sarcastically accused Harold Stassen of campaigning like a county sheriff . Now , before Oregon 's May 21 primary , Tom Dewey was running like an alderman who wanted to meet all of Oregon 's 630,000 voters personally . <P> He hustled down the rainswept Willamette Valley , over to the Pacific Coast and back to the central Oregon lumber country-pumping hands , signing autographs , ripping off ten speeches a day . He peered at cows in Corvallis , at logging operations along the Umpqua River . He accepted a salmon at Oregon City , signed his name in blood for a local booster club at Coos Bay , paraded with an organization called the " Cavemen " at Grants Pass and , at their bidding , munched on a large bone . When his bus ran over a dog near Salem , he shipped off a pedigreed cocker to the bereaved owners , who promptly named it " Dewey " ( but told newsmen they were still for Stassen ) . <P> " Glib Proposals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He concentrated on belaboring " this incredible Administration of ours , " on warning : " Let 's be sure we spend our money like hard-headed Americans instead of soft-headed saps . " Time &; again he thwacked Harold Stassen 's ill-considered plan to outlaw the Communist Party . Such " glib proposals " and " easy panaceas , " he cried , were " nothing but the methods of Hitler and Stalin ... It is thought control borrowed from the Japanese . " He rode the theme so hard that the Portland Oregonian was finally aroused to a tut-tutting editorial : " Let 's not have an Oregon campaign based on who hates Communism most . " <P> It was not all smooth sailing . In Eugene a group of student hecklers from the University of Oregon plopped down in the front row , diligently leafed through copies of LIFE with a picture of Harold Stassen on the cover . In Portland , Dewey refused a drink of bourbon offered by a local politico , ducked out for his own bottle of Scotch . Commented a local columnist : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for refusing to drink out of the common cookin ' likker bottle and then showing up with their own pizen . " <P> New Converts . But Dewey 's dogged campaigning , his determined attempts at folksiness were unquestionably winning him new converts every day . By week 's end Harold Stassen anxiously changed plans and prepared to return to the scene three days ahead of schedule . Dewey was feeling cocky enough to start talking about the men he had in mind for his Cabinet . The Secretary of the Interior , he promised , would certainly be a westerner . For Secretary of State , he announced , he had two men in mind : his longtime adviser John Foster Dulles and his unannounced presidential rival , Arthur Vandenberg.
