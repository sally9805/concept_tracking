Farmer George Thome Bennet 's eldest daughter is a pale , 19-year-old girl named Iris . The last three of his twelve children never lived long enough to get names . Farmer George , said his wife in a complaint charging her husband with murder , drowned each of them at birth in a bucket of water . <P> Last week , from a rural hospital bed to which she had retired with a nervous breakdown , daughter Iris corroborated her mother 's charge . She remembered the incidents well because she herself , at the age of 13 , had helped to deliver one of the babies on the family 's windswept farm in Corangie . Next day she had asked her mother whether she should bathe the child . " You need n't bother , " Audley Bennet told her daughter wearily . " Dad drowned it . "
