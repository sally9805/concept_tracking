String quartets have long played to a smaller public than flea circuses . But one U.S. musical organization , Manhattan 's New Friends of Music , which has succeeded in making chamber music pay , last week gathered reverently to put on their 100th concert . <P> While the famed Budapest Quartet played compositions by Schumann and Haydn , a packed house listened with hushed attention , savored each trill of the viola , each violinistic vibration . Many of the audience were well-known Manhattan musicians who had dropped in for a quiet taste of musicians ' music . Many others were concert-hardened music lovers whom only the caviar of two violins , a viola and a cello could drag from their homes on a pleasant afternoon . But nearly all of them were regular patrons to whom the New Friends ' concerts are a weekly ritual . <P> In the last six years the New Friends have played their devotees whole marathons of chamber music : virtually the entire output of Beethoven , Haydn , Schumann , Brahms , Mozart . They have never deigned to relieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a violin concerto or an opera aria . <P> The New Friends of Music was founded by a smart Manhattan business executive named Ira A. Hirschmann ( vice president of Bloomingdale 's department store ) in order to impress a lady pianist he wanted to marry . Some men buy their prospective brides platinum rings . Black-haired Ira Hirschmann gave Pianist Hortense Monath the New Friends to play with . <P> While Executive Hirschmann handled the New Friends ' business matters with an expert hand , Wife Hortense dictated its artistic policies with the relentlessness of a musical Robespierre . A woman of stern , uncompromising tastes , she decreed that the New Friends should have no stars , no intermissions , no encores , no flowers , no free passes . For her audiences she hired a few carefully selected soloists ( Pianist Artur Schnabel , Violinist Joseph Szigeti and others ) and a roster of the finest string quartet players in the U.S. <P> Instead of picking an artist and asking what program he would like to play , she picked a program and hired the artist to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chamber music , quartet by quartet . The audience could like it or lump it . <P> When Soprano Lotte Lehmann , hired for a selected group of Schubert Lieder , complained that the management had refused to sell extra seats on the stage , and that she felt lonely without a stageful of her devoted admirers , Impresario Monath fixed her with a steely stare . " Mme. Lehmann , " said she coldly , " you are not alone on the stage . Franz Schubert is with you . " <P> Even the most astute of Manhattan musical managers prophesied that Impresario Monath 's funereally earnest concert-giving would end in a bust . But Manhattan concertgoers bought out 97% of the first season 's tickets before she had even presented her first concert . Today , the New Friends still operate without the help of wealthy patrons , still qualify as one of the very few entirely self-supporting high-brow musical institutions in the U.S.
