txt Norman Zeff , a gangster hold-up man , died in St. Joseph 's Hospital in Yonkers yesterday of bullet wounds from the pistols of three policemen . As he lay dying he told how he had murdered two policemen and wounded a third , while other evidence linked him indirectly with the murder of still another policeman . To his last conscious breath he remained a police hater . " Get those bums out , " he asked , indicating Deputy Chief Inspector Michael F. and the two detectives , all three of whom had fired at him on Wednesday as he dangled from the window of a train . He had tried to escape while being brought here from prison for questioning . The story told in the Yonkers hospital yesterday cleared up the murders of Detective James Garvey and Patrolman Philip Clarius in 1934 . He knew he was dying and that the cause of his death was four bullet wounds in his legs and one in his lower abdomen . He had only one regret . " Why could n't those bums have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better this way than in the electric chair . " Times of Deaths Coincide Then Zeff , a professional killer , lost consciousness and never regained it . He died at 12:05 P. M. , the same hour and minute that Patrolman Clarius had died at Dean Street and Third Avenue in Brooklyn on March 15 , 1934 . Clarius did not fire at Zeff because he was afraid of hitting a file of passing children . Zeff had no such scruples . In the aftermath of Zeff 's death Assistant District Attorney James J. Rosenblum , in charge of the homicide division of District Attorney Thomas E. Dewey 's office , moved toward the indictment of Joseph Sonsky , or Somsky , who was involved with Zeff in the murder of Detective Garvey and the wounding of Detective Frank Glealson at the same time , and was also a participant in the hold-up that led to the murder of Patrolman Clarius . Sonsky was brought down from Great Meadow prison a week ago and had been talking since . He was in Great Meadow because he pleaded guilty in Kings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the murder in the second degree of Patrolman John Monaghan , killed at 48 Garden Place , in that borough , the preceding month . He said he used Zeff 's car in getting away from the scene of the Mona- ' ghan murder . Tie-Up With Amen Inquiry Involved in all this there was a tie-up to a current investigation in Brooklyn under Special Prosecutor John Harlan Amen . It appeared 1 from the statement of Zeff and Sonsky that when Garvey was killed and Gleason shot at Broadway and Seventy-fifth Street on April 21 , 1934 , they were really looking for a gangster know ' as Knockout Henny Halpin , or Halperin , on whose head there was an underworld bounty of $500 . They said they thought Garvey and Gleason were a pair of Knockout Henny 's gunmen . The worst that Knockout Henny received in the wars of 1934 was the destruction of an eye  --  an injury I1 that added the appellation of Glasseye to his string of aliases . He finally was shot down at Boerum Place and State Street on Feb. 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juries yesterday handed up a firstdegree murder indictment naming Max ( Little Larney ) Ludkowits as the killer . Mr. Amen declared that grand jury testimony had described Knockout Henny as the man who offered $5,000 in bribes to fix the murder of Joseph Rosen , who at one time was in the garment inI industry and retired to a small shop in Brooklyn 's Brownsville , where he // DYING THUG ADMITS 2 POLICE SLAYINGS // was killed after Louis ( Lepke ) Buchalter became apprehensive about permitting potential witnessses against him to continue alive . The murder of Rosen has been a subject of interest in the murder syndicate inquiry of District Attorney William O'Dwyer in Brooklyn . The Brooklyn ramifications , however , were only of incidental point in the story of Zeff . The reconstruction of those shootings of six years ago began last January , when Mr. Rosenblum received information that the murder of three policemen and the wounding of another had been tied in , in a fashion that at first was vague , to an offer by a gangster boss in Brooklyn 's Williamsburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of these was Knockout Henny . The names of the men who made the offer and of the other gangster , on whom a bounty had been placed '  --  a former co-worker with Halperin  --  were withheld . In any event , as Mr. Rosenblum and his assistants , with the aid of the police , tried to run down this information they came upon a story of the murder of Detective Garvey and the wounding of Detective Gleason that involved Zeff and Sonsky . These two , having tied up with a Williamsburg gang which was then aggrieved at Knockout Henny because he was trying to push his way into control of local policy games , bookmaking , usury and such floating dice games as the neighborhood afforded , decided that $500 for a murder was more profitable than holding up grocery stores ? which had been their previous known occupation . They received information that Knockout Henny would be found on the evening of April 21 , 1934 , in a restaurant at Broadway and Seventy-second Street . They went there , and failing to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the neighborhood . Detectives Garvey and Gleason , on duty at the time , noticed the pair and decided they were behaving suspiciously . They followed Zeff and Sonsky . Then began a strange walk . Up Amsterdam Avenue to Seventyfourth , across to Broadway , up to Seventy-fifth . As both Zeff , dying , and Sonsky , very much alive but apprehensive about his future , told it to Mr. Rosenblum , the two of them had realized that they were being followed , talked it over and decided that they had been doublecrossed . They believed that they had been lured to the neighborhood by a false tip , so that Knockout Henny could turn a couple of his henchmen loose on them . When , at Broadway and Seventyfifth Street , Detectives Garvey and Gleason ordered them back against the building , they waited for nothing . They began to shoot , and the result was the murder of Garvey , and the wounding of Gleason . For a long time he hovered between life and death , and back in service today still carries an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two killers pieced it together , this happened about a month after the Clarius murder . On that occasion , March 15 , 1934 , both of them had gone to a Roulston grocery store at the corner of Hicks and Baltic Streets to rob the place . Accomplishing this , they seized a car belonging to a Roulston employe in front of the store and drove to Third Avenue and Bergen Street , where they planned to rob another of the Roulston chain . As they pulled up they heard a police radio car siren . They separated . Zeff ran toward Dean Street and Third Avenue and Patrolman Clarius , on traffic duty , saw him coming . Patrolman Clarius pulled his pistol . Between him and the running man was a file of children crossing the street and he held his fire . Zeff ducked behind a truck , fired once . The bullet struck Clarius in the chest and felled him . He died within a few minutes . Story of Monaghan Death On the night of Nov. 26 , in 1934 , Sonsky went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and where he kept his weapons . He drove a car he said belonged to Zeff . While he was inside , Patrolman Monaghan entered the place and asked Sonsky to identify himself . Reaching for what Patrolman Monaghan probably thought was identification , Sonsky pulled a pistol instead . Patrolman Monaghan died of his wounds , and Sonsky , picked up a short time later , put in a plea of guilty to second-degree murder , which was accepted by the Brooklyn prosecutor . He was sent to Auburn Prison . In April , 1935 , only a few months later , Zeff was arrested in Tarrytown on a charge of third-degree robbery . He had tried , without arms for once , to hijack a truck . He entered a plea of guilty and went to Auburn on a twelve-year sentence . As Mr. Rosenblum , with the aid of the information that was coming to him , unraveled the story , he decided seven weeks ago to separate the men . Sonsky was transferred to Great Meadow Prison . Meanwhile he asked that Deputy Chief Inspector be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of detectives in Manhattan at the time of the Garvey murder and had worked on that case . A week ago Mr. Rosenblum caused Sonsky to be brought to New York . He was questioned intermittently for five days , and then Mr. Rosenblum determined to bring ' in Zeff as well . On Wednesday he sent Inspector , accom-panied by Detective Harr. , Swift of the Brooklyn Homicide Squad and Detective George Dunphy of the Manhattan Homicide Squad to Auburn to bring in Zeff . It was on the journey here that Zeff tried to escape through a train window and was fired on by his police guard . When the train was stopped about a mile south of Yonkers Zeff leaped off but was unable to run because of his leg wounds .
