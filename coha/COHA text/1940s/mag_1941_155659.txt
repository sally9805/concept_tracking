In Washington , Secretary of War Stimson announced a pattern for the Air Forces ' future . By next June , said he , the Air Forces will be close to triple the size it was last June . It will have 400,000 flying cadets and enlisted men ( plus some 40,000 officers ) , will have planes for its pilots , who by that time should total 25,000 . <P> Added Mr. Stimson : " Subsequent expansion , possibly to the 500,000 level , is possible beyond that date . " <P> When World War II 's urgency first struck the country , after the fall of France , the Air Forces ( then the Air Corps ) had only 3,322 officers , 45,914 enlisted men . By last June its strength had been roughly tripled ( 10,697 officers , 126,666 enlisted men ) . The number of cadets in flying training had risen from 1,894 to 8,707 , and the Air Corps was working with might &; main to train flyers at the rate of 12,000 a year . <P> Today the Air Forces is working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is training its fledglings in 80 civilian and military schools . At 38 more schools it is training gunners , navigators , bombardiers as well as shoals of needed mechanics , radiomen , etc . From schools like Illinois ' Chanute Field ( enrollment 20,000 ) and Colorado 's Lowry Field ( 10,000 ) the Air Forces expects 100,000 technicians a year . <P> When it has grown to 400,000 by next summer , its 54 tactical groups ( two or more squadrons each ) will have been expanded to 84 . The expanded Air Forces will have a heavy accent on youth . Youngsters who were commissioned only two years ago will find themselves commanding squadrons , wearing major 's leaves . <P> At 400,000 , the Air Forces will be a long way short of the strength of Adolf Hitler 's Luftwaffe ( 1,000,000 ) . But by that time personnel production will be grinding at top speed . The only limit to further expansion will be the supply of young men willing and able to fly and service military airplanes.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
