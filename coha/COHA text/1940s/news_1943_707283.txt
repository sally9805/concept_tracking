txt With the battle of Sicily over ahead of schedule , although an artillery combat raged across the Strait of Messina , Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower sat down in a map-walled room today and hailed the American soldiers for having achieved a solid victory that was a combined operation in the most literal sense . " It was a real victory and our troops have done everything that the best troops in the world could have done  --  and that includes the three services , " the Allied Commander in Chief in this theatre declared . The cooperation between the American Seventh Army and the British Eighth Army , he added , could be described as a " one-two punch " that Gen. Sir Harold R. L. G. Alexander could bring into action whenever he desired . Losses 167,000 to 25,000 General Eisenhower 's staff issued a statisticar-Stimmary of the campaign showing that , up to Aug. 10 , German and Italian prisoners taken had exceeded 135,000 , while the enemy 's losses in killed and wounded were not fewer than 32,000 . It was estimated that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eisenhower indicated that the total Allied casualties , on the basis of incomplete figures , stood at about 25,000 . The casualties suffered by the Seventh Army were known to have been relatively severe in the fighting around Troina . The first month of the thirtyeight-day struggle cost the Axis 260 tanks and 502 guns . Through Aug. 17 , 1,691 enemy aircraft were shot down or captured , against the Allies ' loss of 274 . The great majority of the planes lost by the enemy were captured on deserted airfields . Many of them have already been reconditioned and put to use , Moreover , many thousands of military vehicles of all types fell into our hands and quantities of stores are still being collected all over the island . General Glad It 's Over General Eisenhower sat at the head of a table , surrounded , at both chair and floor level , by cortespondents . He wore ribbons symbolizing only two decorations  --  the Knight Commander of the Bath , recently awarded by King George VI , and a French medal presented by Gen. Henri-Honore Giraud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job had been done and that he was particularly satisfied at new evidence of coordination among tilt Allies and among the branches of the service . They had all earned a pat on the back , he said , and congratulations to all the Allied field chiefs had already come from Gen. George C. Marshall , Chief of Staff of the United States Army . Going back over the campaign , General Eisenhower confirmed that the early beach resistance had not been so heavy as expected , but , Sher the Americans had broken through it to the west , there had remained a prodigious marching job to conquer the north coast and join the British at Messina . As evidence of this , the Commander in Chief cited the report of one surgeon who found several cases of men who were unharmed except for the total loss of the skin of the soles of both feet because of the ceaseless pounding over terrible roads or no roads at all . In this connection the General asserted that the engineers had done " magnificent work " in transforming roads from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stresses Amphibious Operations Tactically , General Eisenhower mentioned the amphibious landings behind the enemy lines as perhaps the most interesting aspect of the campaign . There were three such thrusts by the Americans , and only the second encountered serious resistance . The British made one , on the east coast near Roccalumera . General Eisenhower left no doubt that he had been disappoint ed that any Germans had got out of Sicily . But he described the exceeding difficulty of stopping all small craft in the strait and conceded that the Germans had evacuated some of their effectives but probably very little heavy equipment . The figure of 75,000 was given as the Probable German strength in Sicily on July 10 , when the invasion started . No estimate of the Italian strength - was given but Maj. Gen. Walter D. S. Smith , ' General Eisenhower 's Chief of , Staff , revealed last Sunday that the American forces were one-third fewer than the waiting enemy . when the blow fell . General Eisenhower estimated that at least 24,000 of the enemy 's 32,000 killed and wounded were Germans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to add great protection to the Allies ' Mediterranean sea , land and air bases , while depriving the enemy of them and letting the Axis know that it could be beaten on its home ground , the general said . As unsung heroes of the campaign , he hailed everyone ? miners , steel workers , farmers ? doing his duty at home . One correspondent wanted to know how long it would be " between shows " ? in other words , when the next action would be begun . General Eisenhower smiled and said nothing . Then he asked the questioner whether he was planning to go home . The statement accompanying the statistics compiled by Allied IHeadquarters pointed out that the enemy 's boast of driving the Allies into the sea wherever they met in Europe was apparently as empty as the earlier one that assured the Germans that Allied bombs would never fall on their cities . It also pointed out that twice within three and a half months the Allies had soundly thrashed the " invincible " Germans at relatively small cost .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
