The muggy season was setting in for Broadway 's 18 surviving shows , and the U.S. theater got ready again last week to take to the country . By month 's end , in such unlikely pastures as Fish Creek , Wis. and Woods Hole , Mass. , more than 200 summer playhouses will sprout across the land . By Labor Day , they should yield a multimillion-dollar harvest-and more acting jobs than three Manhattan seasons . <P> Would-be and has-been players will vie with Broadway regulars for a place in the summer sun . But , being more commercial than quaint , many a summer playhouse will depend more than ever on big names to draw vacationing theatergoers . Some stars will tour singly , others with supporting players or a whole " package " show-the growing bugaboo of resident troupes . <P> Hardy Perennials . Already busy , milking her Broadway hit and getting the season 's top salary ( $5,000 a week ) , is Tallulah Bankhead in Private Lives . Summer Veteran Edward Everett Horton , who has played Springtime for Henry perennially ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old comedy a rest in favor of Present Laughter . Some of the other country hands : Helen Hayes ( in a tryout of William McCleery 's Good Housekeeping ) , Paul Lukas , Sir Cedric Hardwicke , Eva Le Gallienne , Basil Rathbone , Mady Christians , Ann Harding , Elisabeth Bergner , Joan Blondell , Bert Lahr , Kay Francis . <P> As usual , the circuit will thrive on revivals : The Heiress ( a good bet for one of the summer 's most frequently offered shows ) , Edward , My Son , Light Up the Sky , The Winslow Boy . The summer theaters will also get opera : Broadway 's successful The Telephone and The Medium , offered by a company starring Marie Powers . Other likely favorites : Blithe Spirit , John Loves Mary , 0 Mistress Mine . <P> Proceed with Caution . Once celebrated as a playwrights ' laboratory ( the Provincetown , Mass . Players launched Eugene O'Neill ) , today 's summer theater is in no mood to gamble on experiments . Few of its impresarios will try out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sharp eye on Broadway-in-the-fall . Last year , out of 81 tryouts in 54 playhouses , three plays actually got to Manhattan and one ( The Silver Whistle ) managed to stick . <P> While the summer producers laid big plans , they thought that caution would be a good idea-for the other fellow . They feared that the slumping box office on Broadway and in the cinemansions would spread to the citronella circuit . Besides , costs were up about 5% after last year 's sharp rise of 30% , and admission prices were as high as they could safely go . <P> Smaller operators fretted about new rules by Actors ' Equity , which will hold contracts with about 130 of the theaters . At least 70% of each cast must now belong to Equity , and thus qualify for its $50 minimum summer salary .
