Some people thought William Allen White spoke out of turn last week . His Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies had , as he often pointed out , merely undertaken the job of crystallizing a popular opinion already in favor of giving Britain all aid short of war . The favorable reaction to the President 's destroyer-bases deal was something for which Editor White rightly took much credit . Rightly , last week , the National Association of Accredited Publicity Directors , Inc. made Mr. White the recipient of their annual award for " outstanding service in publicity . " Mr. White succumbed to the temptation to strut in public . <P> Said he : " . . . The really smart trick we pulled was that after Lindbergh made his speech we put his mother-in-law Mrs. Dwight Morrow on the air-and was that a face card ? It was ! She said , ' Telegraph the White House and your Congressmen. ' . . . 15,000 telegrams came tumbling down on Washington , saying ' Give the destroyers to Great Britain . ' They never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce the efforts of the White Committee to mere high-pressure propaganda . Lectured the New York Times next day : " Mr. White 's remarks in this instance are unfortunate . ... A committee similar to Mr. White 's could have pulled any number of smart tricks to get us to send the fifty destroyers to Germany or Italy , and their efforts would have been worse than vain . " After the last war , the Times pointed out , a myth grew up that the U. S. went to war , not out of " the clear-sighted recognition of the need of defeating Germany at that time , " but because it had been tricked by propaganda , et al . Said the Times reprovingly : " We should not permit now the creation of the myth that we have to be tricked into taking actions to insure Hitler 's defeat . "
