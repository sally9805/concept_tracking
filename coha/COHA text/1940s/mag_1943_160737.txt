Not since 1895 has the U.S. had so few acres planted to cotton , the Agriculture Department announced last week . Next day the War Food Administration prepared to relax its hold on cotton sales , left farmers free to sell all they could harvest . No longer must planters pay an 8-a-lb. penalty for all sales above their AAA marketing quotas . <P> The Government had asked for 30 million acres of cotton this year . Bad weather and manpower troubles cut cotton plantings to less than 22 million acres . This picture was gloomy , but not final . There is nearly enough in reserve ( eleven million bales ) to meet a year 's needs , but much of it is low-grade , or unsuitable short-staple . If-and this is a big if-the 1943 yield per acre is as good as last year 's ( a high of 272 lb. per acre ) , it will be enough to meet the record U.S. needs for a year .                  @ @ @
