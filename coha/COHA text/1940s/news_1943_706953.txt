txt Forgotten Man Found It is remotely possible that both the , Army and the Manpower Commission have found the lamented " forgotten man . " He seems to be any American male who is over 37 . The Army is sending him home and the Manpower Commission feels certain that it can . ' win the war by mobilizing only those ' males between the ages of 18 and 37 , both for war and industry . But the ultimate sting to the pride . of American males over 37 must come from the fact that the Army considers women of 45 much more capable of performing certain military duties . - Some of us wonder what is wrong with American males over 37 ? who seem , physically , not to come up to the requirements of either the Army or industry .
