txt  | floor plates with a release button in the trigger guard . The third action is the big Magnum action , also with the release button for the floor plate in the trigger guard , but a good deal longer and with a longer bolt-throw than the standard action . The Magnum is suitable for the longest cartridges , like the .300 and .375 Magnum . All of these " original " actions are excellent , but because of the freezing of the mark , high tariff , and probably high markups by the importer , they were very expensive in the last years before the war . A 1939 Stoeger catalogue lists the short and standard actions at seventy and eighty dollars and the Magnum actions at one hundred dollars ? all of which explains why the common or garden variety of gun nut is not likely to own a rifle on a Waffenfabrik action . The " Gewehr " 98 and " Kar " ( short rifle ) 98 actions of both great wars , however , are well worth good barrels and the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own favorite .270 Mauser is made up on an old 98 action that was imported into this country right after the first World War as the basis of a cheap 8-mm. sporter with oversize bore and poor stock . Some German gunsmith had pounded out the bolt handle and turned it down to the flat-bolt type . I threw away barrel and stock and had W. A. Sukalle fit a sporting-weight .270 barrel with ramp front sight , checker the trigger , mat the receiver , and adjust the trigger pull to a crisp three pounds . Then I had Alvin Linden fit a beautifully shaped and inletted stock of Bosnian walnut with a Koshollek grip cap and an imported trap butt-plate , and Frank Pachmayr of Los Angeles fit a Noske 2 ' / , x scope on Noske mounts with his form-fitting base . The result was a beautiful sporting rifle , as fine as any in the world , one that I have used with perfect satisfaction on many hunting trips . In many respects the 98 Mauser action is superior to any of the modified Mauser-type actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaping gas from a pierced primer or a burst cartridge case better than does any other action . There arc two large oval cuts through the bolt into the firing-pin space just back of the  | locking lugs , which conduct the ' escaping gas down the left lug race so it can escape through the deep cut in that lug race which is present to enable the shooter to press home a clip of cartridges with his left thumb ? a feature not present on the earlier Model 93 and 95 actions , by the way . Furthermore the flanged boltsleeve tends to dissipate any remaining gas upward away from the shooter 's eyes . Because of the excellence of the 98 in handling gas and the great strength and ruggedness of the action , it is an excellent one to use with cartridges of high pressure . Once I bought at a bargain a case of old 7-mm. ammunition that had been brought to the border to smuggle to Pancho Villa , the Mexican bandit general , about 1916 . It never crossed the boundary and found its way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at least eighteen years old and the brass was pretty brittle , I got hold of some and used it for practice in a fine lightweight 7-mm. rifle on a Waif enfabrik action . I thought I had exercised due precaution when I discarded those cartridges with split necks . I had n't . I was shooting prone when there was a tremendous flash and an explosion right in my face . I opened the bolt and only the rim of the case came out . The head had completely blown off and a tremendous volume of gas had escaped to the rear . With a Springfield that would have resulted in a bulged magazine that would have shattered the stock , and the rifle would have been in a very sad state of repair . That Mauser , however , took it in its stride and was not harmed in the slightest . I had only to get out the remaining part of the case and go on shooting . I buried the rest of that ancient ammunition , however , and never shot another round of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found on any boltaction rifle . It is small , neat , and strong . It is located just forward of the root of the bolt handle and turns down into a recess in the receiver . The Mauser firing pin is one piece , less liable to breakage than those on the Winchester Model 54 and the Springfield and its blow is not cushioned by two-piece construc-  | tion . Extraction is probably the most positive of any bolt-action and I can not remember ever having failed to extract a case that remained in one piece ? something I can not say about any other bolt action I have ever used . The 1903 Springfield . No action has been the basis for more fine sporting rifles in America than the good old 1903 Springfield , and indeed the Springfield arsenal turned out an excellent Springfield sporting rifle , beautifully bedded and tuned up , but in a rather plain , oversize stock during most of the 1920 's and early 1930 'S . At one time this good sporter , with action adjusted to velvet smoothness , with star-gauged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold to members of the National Rifle Association for only forty dollars . It is not difficult to imagine how happy this made the commercial manufacturers of .30/06 rifles , who have to let the jobber and the dealer in on a small cut , who also have to pay the stockholders an occasional dividend , and who do not have the tax payer as an angel . Probably the manufacture of a good sporter by the government was at that time justified , because in many ways the early Model 30 Remingtons and Model 54 Winchesters were terrible turkeys . When the revamped Model 54 known as the N.R.A . model came out , about the same time as the good Remington 3o-S , there was no real justification for a government-subsidized sporting rifle , and this famous special Springfield was discontinued . The Springfield action is a modified Mauser , which was designed at the Springfield arsenal at about the turn of the century by crossing the Mauser with the Drag . Various departures were made from Mauser design , and in every instance the designers laid an egg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were made as an improvement , they failed . If they were made with the worthy notion of avoiding royalty payments to Paul von Mauser , the inventor of the Mauser action , they also failed , since Mauser put the bite on Uncle Sam for a royalty of one dollar for every rifle manufactured for many years . The Springfield uses a two-piece rather than a one-piece Mau-  | ser firing pin . That 's mistake number one . The two-piece job cushions the blow of the firing pin against the primer and also makes it a more delicate mechanism , more liable to breakage . No one knows that better than I. In 1939 the firing pin of my old Springfield sporter crystallized and broke . The pin itself wedged in the hole in the bolt face and fired a cartridge when I was pushing the bolt home and before I could turn down the handle . Result : a bulged chamber and ruined barrel , shattered stock , twisted floor plate . And a broken thumb almost torn off my right hand , along with a face full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Until that time I had never heard of such an accident , but when I mentioned it in a magazine article , several Springfield users wrote in , saying they had had a similar experience . The locking lugs of the Springfield are nearer the head of the bolt than on the Mauser ? right at the end , in fact . Springfield lugs seem somewhat more liable to breakage . The safety lug is a big , clumsy hunk of metal on the bolt that does nothing useful except to trip the bolt out to the right in case the lugs let go , as it does not bear against the thin shoulder of the receiver in a properly adjusted action . Actually it is supposed to be 4/1,000 of an inch away from it . This big safety lug results in a high receiver bridge and the consequently high line of sight of the Springfield . The Springfield handles escaping gas far more poorly than does the Mauser . It has no cuts in the bolt to carry the gas down the lug race , no flange on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although the head of the cocking piece performs this function to some extent . The Springfield does have a small gas-escape vent at the right of the receiver ring . Recent ones also have a much larger escape vent on the left side , which is a pious idea because it is gas scooting up the left lug race that is more apt to play hob with the shooter . The Springfield feeds cartridges with various type bullets more dependably than does the Mauscr because of the good  | design of the rear end of the barrel and the magazine throat . Both Mauser and Model 1917 sometimes give trouble with soft-nose bullets . The Springfield has no thumb-groove for clip loading . Gas is not dissipated there and clip loading is slower , but actually this is of little importance . The safety on the Springfield is of the Mauser type , but is more complicated and has more parts . Not important . Ejector and bolt stop are different but all right . Actually the Springfield action is a very good one and those seen on military rifles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The action is well worth the trouble and expense that rifle-lovers have gone to to make it the basis of fine sporters . Many different types of Springfield rifles have been turned out ? service , sporter , national match , snipers ' rifles , and so on ; but they do not need to concern us in this chapter except in a very general way . The national-match Springfields have a headless cocking piece and a reversed safety . The headless cocking piece does not divert escaping gas as does the standard one with the knurled knob , and the reversed safety is a general pain in the neck , slow , clumsy to operate for the right-handed man , and confusing to one used to standard Springfield and Mauser safeties . Earlier Springfields had bolt handles that turned straight down , but about 1920 the handles were given a slight slant to the rear to put the bolt knob nearer the hand . When the manufacture of the semiautomatic M-1 Garand rifle got under way at the Springfield arsenal , all manufacture of Springfields ceased there . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arms Company at Ilion , New York , and Remington brought out war-baby Springfields , used to some extent by the army , particularly in a sniper 's rifle , to be sent to China and perhaps other Allied countries . In addition it brought out a special modification of the Springfield to be used as a sniper 's rifle , with a bolt turned down a la Model 70 for lowmounting of the Weaver 330 and Lyman Alaskan scopes . Differences between the war babies and standard Springfields are  | the big gas-escape vents on the left side of the receiver and the fact that the Remington-made rifles have a stamped rather than a milled trigger guard , with trigger guard and floor plate in one piece and not detachable , as they were in the old Model 54 Winchesters , which may be justified for speedy war production but will be a pain in the neck to any rifle nut . Incidentally , the Remington-made Springfields have broached rather than bored and rifled barrels , with only two grooves . Until 1918 all Springfield receivers were made of case-hardened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receivers one hears so much about . Actually thousands of them are in use with the hottest of modern loads and have never given a whimper . They are not so strong and tough , however , as later actions , and with the continual pounding in rifles with excessive head space they have been known to shatter . The firm of R. F. Sedgley of Philadelphia built thousands of Springfield sporters on these old bolts and actions , but they worked out a method of heat-treating them that reduced the brittleness . Before the war the owner of a low-number Springfield could have the receiver heat-treated by Sedgley . From 1918 until 1927 and from No. 800,000 to No. 1,275,766 Springfield used very tough double-heat-treated receivers , and these are perfectly satisfactory . In 1927 , with receiver No. 1,275,767 , Springfield adopted nickel-steel bolts and receivers , which are still stronger and tougher . Actually , any receiver over 800,000 has a tremendous margin of safety. * My old Springfield began life as a 1926 N.R.A . sporter . Its receiver is of the double-heat-treated type and its number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have are of the nickel-steel type ? one numbered over 1,300,000 and the other , evidently one of the last actions turned out by Springfield , over 1,400,000 . The first formed the basis for a .257 , the second for a .30/06 , since my old Springfield has seen better days and I need a spare . In the years that gunsmiths have been turning Springfield footnote * Receivers made at Rock island numbered between 285,507 and 219,920 are of the double heat-treated type . Those from 219,921 up arc of nickel steel .  | rifles into sporters and using the actions as the basis for fine sporting rifles in other calibers , many strange and interesting things have been done to them . In the days before the low mounting of telescope sights it was common to thin down the bolt handle to a smaller diameter and to turn it down closer to the stock . Bolt handles were also sometimes given a further bend to the rear . Today , with the low mounting of telescope sights universal , the bolt handle is commonly cut off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low-mounted scope , and the safety is modified to operate without a complete ninety-degree turn . The upper tang , with its rather clumsy shape , is often reshaped to look like that of the Mauser in fine rifles . The trigger guard is often narrowed from front to rear , and occasionally the floor plate is hinged , the forward portion of the trigger guard built up with soft steel , and a release button installed so the magazine can be emptied with one press of the button as in the latest Mausers . The only two gunsmiths I have ever known to do the job are Bob Owen and Bill Sukalle . It has been done to two of my Springfield actions , and these are always confounding gun nuts who examine them . Bolt knobs and safeties are often checkered in fine rifles . Back in the days when the use of the Lyman 48 receiver sight was almost universal , a special straightarm model was made for custom Springfields with the receiver bridge milled out to take it . Probably the remodeling of Springfields into custom sporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1920 's and early 1930 's . A more sensible way for the man with a yen for something special to begin is to buy a standard Model 70 Winchester or Model 700 Remington and have it restocked as his heart desires . The Model 54 Winchester . Any Model 54 is now an obsolete rifle , and few Model 54 'S are rebarreled and restocked , since the gun nut will usually choose a Mauser , Springfield , or Model 70 Winchester action for his base of operations . The Model S4 came out in 1925 because of the demand by returned soldiers for a bolt-action sporting rifle in a .30/06  | caliber . The fine .270 cartridge was also introduced with the first 54 'S . The 54 is a modified Mauser with Springfield idea incorporated . Gun nuts , however , did not like its awkward reversed safety , its stamped , cheap-looking trigger guard and non-detachable floor-plate . Nor did they like its use of the trigger as a bolt stop , since a trigger properly hardened to keep its pull was apt to snap when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lack of any provision for escaping gas , but Winchester remedied this free of charge with the older 54 'S by milling holes at the factory . Otherwise the S4 was and is a strong , smooth-working action of good nickel steel like the later Springfields . The Model 70 Winchester . Conscious of the shortcomings of the 54 , the Winchester designers decided to redesign the whole action , and the Model 70 , considered by many the finest bolt-action in the entire world , was the result . Unlike the 54 , the 70 has a handsome milled trigger guard . It also has a detachable floor plate hinged at the forward end , with a release just forward of the trigger guard , not in the trigger as it is in the Mauser . The release is clumsy , slow , and difficult to work and it is to be regretted that Winchester did not spend a few more cents per action to install a release button in the trigger guard as in the latest Mausers . The bolt is handsomely shaped and curved to the rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than does the 54 bolt , but until recently it was still too high for the lowest scope mounting and gunsmiths had to grind it off . The old safety was the worst feature of the action . It was slow , clumsy , stiff , and did not permit the lowest scope mounting . Usually when a low scope is installed , a Tilden , Griffin &; Iiowe , or Pachmayr safety is substituted . The post-war Model 70 's have a more civilized safety and a lower bolt lift . Two holes in the bolt carry escaping gas into the left lug race , and like the Springfield the Model 70 also has a gas-escape vent in the right side of the receiver . Cams shorter than those on the  | Springfield permit a very easy bolt lift , and a guide flange on the left side of the bolt makes it quick and easy to operate , with no tendency to cramp or bind . It has a separate bolt stop and does not use the trigger for that purpose . Locking lugs are at the head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lug is not slotted . As a safety lug , the root of the bolt handle turns into a recess in the receiver wall . The trigger is of new and novel design for a bolt-action rifle . It is not of the double-draw type , but instead gives a crisp let-off like a shotgun trigger . The pull is adjustable within limits by adjusting nuts . Besides the two guard screws the Model 70 has a third screw midway between them to hold the trigger , which is separate . Experience seems to show that this screw should not be tightened so much as the guard screws for the best accuracy . Instead one should get it just " good and snug " and then let well enough alone . The Model 70 bolt action is certainly one of the two best actions in the world . It can not be purchased separately , but the man wanting a de-luxe rifle stocked to his own specifications can get a standard Model 70 sporter or target rifle and go on from there . The U.S. 1917 , the Remington Model 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British Army in the midst of a change in their army rifle . They had long seen the faults of the old Lee-Enfield , with its two-piece stock and its one-lug bolt action , unable to withstand high pressures . Consequently an entire new rifle for a brand-new cartridge was designed . The rifle was called the Model of 1914 and the cartridge was a powerful one of 7 mm. or .276 caliber , longer than the .303 British cartridge , rimless , giving a velocity of around 3,000 foot-seconds . The action is of the Mauser type , but greatly modified . There arc two locking lugs at the head of the bolt , and the bolt-handle turning into a cut in the receiver serves as a safety lug . The firing pin is of one-piece construction , but the extractor collar is thin  | and the extractor itself not stiff . Hence high pressures , rough chambers , and soft brass cases are likely to result in extraction difficulties that may put a rifle out of commission temporarily . Unlike the Mauser , the action cocks on the closing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than serious . The bolt is of peculiar shape , and unlike the Mauser or Springfield it does not turn up into the line of sight . This , coupled with a. " rocker " safety which moves fore and aft , makes low scope mounting possible on the action without alterations . Big clumsy ears project up at the rear of the receiver to protect the rear peep sight . The whole action is big , strong , and massive in the main and is a great favorite to rebarrel to magnum calibers like the .300 , .375 H. &; H. , and .35 Newton . Since hundreds of thousands of short Enfields were on hand in British arsenals and there was a good supply of ammunition for them , the British never adopted the Model 1914 as the official British army rifle . Remington and Winchester , however , tooled up to make them in this country for the British and adapted them to the rimmed .303 British cartridge . Contracts were about finished when the United States entered the war in 1917 . The American government was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the facilities of the Springfield and Rock Island arsenals were not sufficient to turn out Model 1903 Springfields fast enough . As a result the British 1914 rifle was adapted to the .30/06 cartridge and called the U.S. Model 1917 . The bolt face , extractor , and magazine were adapted to the rimless cartridge . The same barrel tools were used , and as a consequence the 1917 rifles have the British left-hand twist and are slightly oversize . The bore diameter is .303 against the .30 of the Springfield , and the groove diameter is .311 instead of .308 . During the 1920 's and 1930 's tens of thousands of those rifles were sold to civilians for $7.50 for a second-hand rifle and $ro for an unused one , and early in 1946 the sale began again . They were restocked by the hundreds and rebarreled to everything from the .22 Varminter to the .375 Magnum . Many gunsmiths  | made a living by altering them to cock on the opening motion of the bolt , milling the ears off , and installing sporting stocks and sights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bringing out a bolt-action sporting rifle for the .30/06 cartridge , and since the firm was tooled up to manufacture the 1917 , that rifle was used as the basis for the new one . It was called the Model 30 Remington . The first ones had the oversize barrel and left-hand twist of the 1917 and were indeed probably made largely from 1917 parts . The stock was a weird contraption with grasping grooves in the forestock , and like the parent rifle it cocked on the closing motion of the bolt . The next model had a somewhat improved stock , which was still unsatisfactory ; it had been altered to cock on the opening motion and a shotguntype trigger pull had been substituted . The rifle had plenty of faults , but it did have the virtue of mounting a telescope sight low . Belding &; Mull , Philipsburg , Pennsylvania , scope-makers , brought out a Model 30 with a special high-combed stock for scopes , and shortly after Remington made that stock official with the model called the 3o-S . By this time it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the Model 54 Winchester . It was brought out in the .30/06 , the .25.7 , and the 7-mm . Mauser . At one time it was also made in the Remington rimless line of cartridges ? .25 , .30 , .32 , and .35 , but eventually those and the 7 mm. were discontinued . The last modification by Remington of the old 1917 was the Model 720 , which was simply the 1917 modified , with a bettershaped bolt handle , a fine trigger pull , minor changes here and there . Actually it looks very much like the fine remodeled 1917 'S turned out by ace gunsmiths like Alvin Linden . The Model 20 Savage . Right after the first World War , the Savage Arms Corporation led the parade in producing boltaction sporting rifles by turning out the Model 20 , the only  | short , Mauser-type action ever manufactured in this country . It was chambered for the .250/3000 and .300 Savage cartridges . The first rifles were very , very light , weighing only a bit over six and a half pounds . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lugs are large and strong and the receiver ring is heavy . The magazine is typically Mauser . The bolt-handle , however , passes through a split in the receiver bridge and consequently the action is not suitable for low scope mounting . The faults of the action make it unsuitable for rebarreling to a high-class expensive cartridge , but anyone looking for a very lightweight rifle in .250/3000 or .300 might consider it , with his eyes open to its shortcomings . The Remington Model 721 . The action of the 721 and , in short form , the 722 was , when introduced , of entirely new design . Instead of having a drop-forged receiver , it has one machined from steel bar stock . Floor plate and trigger guard are a single stamping . Trigger and trigger mechanisms are made of stampings , and the safety looks like the one on the Remington " 5oo " series .22 'S . Because the action is cheap-looking , it is not one that the gun nut is going to buy to have a custom rifle built on . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , the extractor is a heavy circular spring in the recessed bolt that completely encloses the head of the case . The action should handle very high pressures because of this , as pressure limits have heretofore been set not by the strength of the action so much as by the strength of the brass case . Model 721 rifles weigh only about seven and a quarter pounds because of the light receivers , yet they are chambered for .270 , .30/06 , and .300 Magnum cartridges . The Model 722 action ( identical except that it is shorter ) handles the .257 and .300 Savage cartridges . It could be rebarreled nicely to .250/3000 or .22/250 . The action is locked with two massive lugs on the front of the bolt , as in the Mauser , and the bolt turning down into a cut  | in the receiver acts as a third , or safety , lug . The magazine is the conventional staggered , double-column Mauser box magazine . In the spring of 1962 , Remington brought out a new bolt action rifle , the Model 700 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the 722 , and the 725 ? which was a modification of the Model 721 . The Model 70o is a handsome rifle with the best-shaped stock Remington has ever put on a bolt-action sporter . It has a Monte Carlo comb , a cheek-piece , and good-looking reversed checkering stamped in with heat and pressure . The fancier model , the BDL has fancier " checkering " and a hinged floorplate . The standard model has no floorplate . The new rifle is made in .222 , .222 Magnum , .243 , .270 , .280 , .308 , .30/06 , .264 , the new 7 mm . Remington Magnum , .375 , and .458 Magnum . The extractor has been beefed up and checkering stamped on the bolt knob . The Savage Model zzo . The new Savage Model r10 action is the first Mauser-type action turned out by Savage since the Model 1920 . The receiver is machined from bar stock and not forged . It is a modified Mauser and it is made in both right- and left-handed models . It has a recessed bolt face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolt carries an extra pair of lugs behind the locking lugs . They do not lock . Instead they guide the bolt in the raceway of the receiver and serve as a gas shield . The head of the bolt and the receiver are vented for escaping gas . The Model r 10 action is a strong one . As this is written , the rifle around which it is built is chambered for the .30/06 and .270 cartridge and for the .243 and the .308 , but the rifle will probably be brought out in .264 , .338 , and 7 mm . Remington Magnum . The Weatherby Mark V. After some years of building his Magnum rifles on F. N. Mauser actions , Roy Weatherby redesigned the Mauser action according to his own ideas and called the result the Mark V. He has eliminated the Mauser faults of the partially exposed cartridge case , the wobbly bolt travel , and the wing-type safety . Instead of two lugs , the Mark V has nine .  | The bolt face is counter-bored to receive and enclose the head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also counterbored to enclose the portion of the bolt that houses the head of the cartridge case . The bolt lift is 45 degrees instead of 90. degrees of the standard Mauser-type action . Extractor does n't have the bite area of the Mauser but seems sufficient . Ejector is of plunger type . The Weatherby action is a very strong one , and with its crisp single-stage trigger , smooth bolt , and good safety , it is entirely satisfactory . The first Mark V actions were made in this country from castings , but the actions are now made in Germany from forgings . OTHER BOLT ACTIONS After World War II , shrewd Americans began to import obsolete military rifles and have sold them by the tens of thousands by means of extravagant and colorful advertising . Some of the rifles are sound enough , in fairly good shape , and American factory ammunition can be obtained for them . The man who buys a Model 1917 Enfield , a good Model 98-type Mauser , or a high-number Model 1903 Springfield in good shape has a basically sound rifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The best of the others have unsatisfactory actions and stocks and sights not suited for sporting use , even if ammunition such as the 7 X 57 Mauser , the .303 British , and the 8 x 57 Mauser are obtainable in this country . The Swedish bolt-action Mausers in 7 X 55 caliber can be used as they are if the military sights are replaced . Like all Mausers of the Model 93 ? 95 type , however , they are not suitable for pressures of over about 45,000 pounds per square inch . Most of the other imports are junk and poor buys no matter what the cost .  | Rifle Barrels RIFLE barrels are simply pieces of steel with holes in them in which spiral grooves known as rifling have been cut . The con- , ventional process of making a rifle barrel consumes a good deal of time and takes several operations . First a hole is drilled through a steel bar . Then the hole is reamed smooth to what is known as bore diameter . Then the rifling is cut into the barrel , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the rifling is completed , the measurement from the bottom of one groove to the bottom of the opposite groove is known as groove diameter . The original diameter of the bore before the rifling was cut is known as the bore diameter . As we have seen , the most common practice is to name a caliber from the bore diameter , but a good many calibers get their name from the groove diameter . There are various systems of rifling . Sometimes the lands are narrow and the grooves are twice as wide or even wider . Sometimes the lands and the grooves are of the same width . In the usual system the lands have sharp corners , but in some systems the corners of lands and grooves are rounded and give the appearance of a worn barrel . Narrow lands usually give somewhat better accuracy than wide lands and they seem to give lower pressures . But the accuracy life of a barrel cut with wide lands is longer because the lands are less delicate and are not so quickly washed away by erosion . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the  | usual practice in this country to cut the grooves for the .22 rimfire .0025 inches deep . Grooves for the .25 caliber are .0035 . The standard .3o-caliber groove is .004 . It is the American practice to make the groove diameter of the finished barrel the same size as the bullet diameter . The English and Continental practice is to use grooves deeper than the American grooves and a groove diameter greater than the diameter of the bullet . This system does not ordinarily give as good accuracy as the American system , particularly with the hard , tough , jacketed bullet , which can not upset to fill the grooves . This Continental system , however , produces satisfactory accuracy for most purposes and it gives the barrel longer life than the American system . Old 7.9 German army rifles will give reasonably good accuracy when , according to American standards , they should be pretty well worn out . The number of grooves varies from two to eight . During the second World War a great many barrels turned out in the United States for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broached instead of rifled and and had two very wide lands . These barrels are not as accurate as four- and six-groove barrels , but for war conditions and for most hunting their accuracy is good enough . The 1917 Enfield rifles made during World War I had five-groove barrels because those were the original British specifications . The lands and the grooves are of equal width . P. O. Ackley , the Trinidad , Colorado , gunmaker , has experimented with three-groove barrels . His theory was that these barrels would give less pressure and higher velocity . He found no particular advantage in them , however . Most high-power barrels of .30 caliber and under are cut with four grooves , and barrels of over that caliber are cut with six . Usually .22 barrels also have six grooves . Some high-power barrels and some .22 barrels have been cut with as many as eight grooves . It is customary in the United States to give the rifling a righthand twist . At very long ranges the spin imparted to the bullet  | by this twist will cause the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed for . The exception to this rule is the Colt revolver , which is rifled with a left-hand twist because the Colt revolvers were standardized with that twist when they were made in England . The 1917 Enfields made during World War I have this British left-hand twist . The grooves are cut with different rates of twist , depending on the length of the bullet in proportion to the caliber and the speed at which the bullets are to be driven . A very long bullet at a moderate velocity requires a very sharp twist or pitch of rifling . For example , the Mannlicher-Schoenauer made in Austria for the very long 16o-grain 6.5 Mannlicher-Schoenauer bullet at a velocity of only about 2,100 foot-seconds , needs a twist of about one turn in 71/2 inches in order to stabilize that bullet or to keep its point on at game ranges . If that bullet were fired , let us say , in a I ? Io twist , it would keyhole or fly sidewise , and of course the accuracy would be very poor . On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one turn in 24 inches . The .22 short bullet weighs only 29 grains . The .22 long rifle bullet weighs 40 grains , and if one is shot in a 1 ? 24 pitch of rifling , poor accuracy and keyholing will result because the bullet is not stablized . The standard pitch for the .22 long rifle is 1-16 . Rifles on the American market that are made to handle either short , long , or long rifle cartridges have the pitch of the .22 long rifle , and as a consequence they do not give particularly good accuracy with the .22 short bullet because that short bullet is overstabilized . The .25/35 uses a relatively long 117-grain bullet at a moderate velocity . The pitch is 1-8 . On the other hand , the .257 , which was designed for bullets weighing from 87 to 117 grains at much higher velocities , has a pitch of 1 ? i o . It will handle bullets weighing up to 125 grains with good accuracy up to 300 yards , but the 87-grain bullet is less accurate than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was originally designed for a relatively short 87-grain bullet at a high  | velocity of 3,000 feet per second has a twist of 1 ? 14 . It will handle a loo-grain bullet with good accuracy , but that slow twist will not stabilize a 117-grain bullet . The .30/06 uses a standard twist of 1 ? 10 because the cartridge was originally designed for military use and the rate of twist established to spin the bullets clear out to a thousand yards or over . When commercial factories took up the cartridge they followed arsenal specifications . As a matter of fact , the pitch of the rifling in the .30/06 is a little too abrupt for sporting use , as the big-game hunter will never shoot at a thousand yards . A twist of 1 ? 12 will stabilize even the 22o-grain .30/06 bullet to three hundred yards and more when it is fired at a velocity of 2,400 foot-seconds . It is generally conceded that with a twist of 1 ? 10 the .270 W.C.F. is not ideal . One can obtain excellent accuracy with bullets weighing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ? 12 twist gives equally good accuracy with any bullet weighing up to 150 grains and it gives much better accuracy with the 100-grain bullet at very high velocity . As made by the factories , the .300 Magnum has a twist of 1 ? 1o . Most custom barrelmakers cut the .300 with a twist of 1 ? 14 and report better accuracy and somewhat lower pressures . The ideal pitch of rifling should be just fast enough to stabilize the bullet at the range at which it is to be shot . The sharper the twist , the higher the pressure and the greater the strain on the bullet jacket . Most high-velocity .22 'S like the Hornet , the Bee , and the Swift have barrels cut with a twist running from 1 ? 14 to 1 ? 16 .. When a bullet is fired from a barrel , it loses velocity rapidly , but the spin remains almost constant over game ranges . Let us take a .270 bullet fired at over 3,100 foot-seconds . In every second of its flight it spins well over three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not think there is any doubt that the rate of spin of a bullet adds to the killing power to some extent . As the jacket folds back , it is often sharp , and the spinning bullet cuts like a buzz-saw . This was graphically illustrated to me one  | time when I was hunting whitetail deer in southern Arizona . A good four-point buck got up about two hundred and fifty yards away just under the brow of a hill and started off at a dead run . I managed to get the dot reticule in my scope right on his hind end just as he was about to clear the ridge and I squeezed the shot off . That buck traveled about twenty feet through the momentum of his running . When I got to him I found that the bullet had struck right between the hams , and penetrated right up through the abdomen , and then the whirling bullet with the sharp-edged jacket had simply sawed all his ribs in two on the right side . I found the bullet under the hide of the brisket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barrel is made has been drilled , reamed , and rifled , it is known as a barrel blank . Only a relatively few gunsmiths are equipped to turn out complete barrels . Most of them buy rough blanks from men who specialize in their manufacture . In ordinary times these blanks can be bought from the factories like Winchester , Remington , or Savage . They can also be bought from barrelmakers like W. A. Sukalle , 1120 East Washington Street , Pheonix , Arizona ; Bliss Titus , Heber City , Utah ; John Buhmiller , Eureka , Montana , and others . It is necessary for the gunsmith to turn the barrel to size and weight , and to straighten it so that the finished barrel will be relatively straight . Then he has to thread it to the action to which it is to be fitted , chamber it for the individual cartridge , fit sights , polish it , and blue it . As a usual thing the gunsmith also has to lap the barrel . He will cast a lead lap around a steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an abrasive and polish the tool marks out of the barrel . All barrels are not lapped . As a matter of fact , the Springfield arsenal never lapped its barrels , considering lapping an inexact operation . Instead they tried to get the barrels so smooth in reaming and rifling that lapping was not necessary . Nevertheless most custom and factory barrels are lapped , and in most instances careful lapping will improve the accuracy . Straightening barrels is a very important operation , and  | straightening is necessary every time metal is removed from within or without . It is impossible to turn down a barrel on a lathe without getting some kinks in it . Many an amateur has put a barrel on a lathe and merrily turned it down , taking deep cuts , only to find after he was finished that he could practically shoot around a corner with it . When the barrel is turned down , shallow cuts should be taken and the barrel removed from the lathe and straightened after every cut , as every cut taken releases tension within the metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size before they begin drilling . These " pre-turned blanks , " as J. R. Buhmiller calls them , presumably never unkink as they heat up . When a barrel has been extensively straightened it will " warp . " What is meant is that as the barrel heats up , the shots will string up and down the target . When they get good and hot , many barrels will put their bullets literally inches away from where they put them when they are cold . The commonest way to straighten a barrel these days is with an overhead clamp . The skilled operator can look through the barrel and by the shadows tell where the kink is . Then he can bear down with the clamp and get the kink out of it . The old method of straightening a barrel was to see where the kink was , then place the barrel between two lead blocks and give it a smart rap with a lead hammer . Practically all American barrels are round these days , but formerly many of them were made in octagon shape . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bluing wore off on the sharp edges faster than it wore off elsewhere . The barrel heated up unevenly , and it was heavier than necessary for its strength . In Europe barrels of various fancy shapes are made . Often the breech portion is an octagon . Often full-length ribs are milled on the barrel . The full-length matted rib is in the opinion of some very handsome . Theoretically anyway , the full-length rib should stiffen the barrel somewhat . Theoretically , also , the barrel would show a tendency to heat up unevenly and change point  | of impact . Actually , however , the only real disadvantages of a ribbed barrel are that it is expensive to manufacture and that it is heavier than it need be . Barrels are made with various weights and various contours as well as various lengths . The short barrel is handy to carry on horseback in a saddle scabbard . It is also handy to use in the woods . But the short barrel has its disadvantages . For one thing , if iron sights are used , the sighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accuracy . For another thing , the short barrel gives increased muzzle blast . The powder is still burning as it strikes the air . Not only is the muzzle blast actually more severe , but it seems even worse because it is closer to the ears . Furthermore , the barrel shorter than standard has a velocity loss which averages about 25 foot-seconds for every inch cut off the barrel . In a .30/06 , for example , where the standard barrel length is 24 inches , a 20-inch barrel would deliver approximately zoo foot-seconds less than the published velocity . Likewise there is a velocity gain with a longer barrel . The .30/06 , 18o-grain load that delivers 2,700 foot-seconds in a 24-inch barrel will deliver about 2,750 in a 26-inch barrel . For practical purposes , however , not a great deal is gained through using a barrel longer or shorter than 24 inches . Because it burns a lot of powder and has a loud report and great muzzle blast , the .300 Magnum is usually made with a 26-inch barrel . Heavy bull guns for long-range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since those guns are used from the prone position and are not carried great distances in the field , weight does not make much difference . It is easier to hold a heavy rifle steady than a light one . These long barrels give a greater sighting radius and hence better accuracy for target work . The standard 24-inch barrel is just about right for hunting . The man who wants an extra-light handy rifle can have a barrel as short as 22 inches in the .30/06 or .270 . With the .257 , if he wants a featherweight , he can have a barrel as short as 21 or  | even 20 inches . For cartridges like the .250/3000 and the .25/35 , the 20-inch barrel is not bad at all . The man getting a custommade barrel could well have a rifle for hunting only made with a 22-inch barrel , but if he gets a factory rifle with a 24-inch barrel , I doubt if it is worth the time or money to have the barrel cut off and a new front sight fitted . As we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being equal , the more uniformly it will shoot . It heats up more slowly It is less sensitive to sloppy bedding . Because it heats up more slowly it will shoot a small ten-shot group , and for that reason experimenters who do a lot of rest shooting favor the heavy barrel . As far as practical accuracy goes , however , it is the first two or three shots from a cold barrel that deliver the bacon . The best hunting rifle should deliver those first two or three shots into the same group day after day . If the light barrel is bedded correctly , it will deliver these small groups and as far as accuracy is concerned it is just about as good as a heavy one . The barrel should be of such weight that without a scope sight and sling the hunting rifle would ordinarily not weigh more than about eight pounds if it is to be carried long distances . The target shooter , of course , does not carry his rifle and he can use a very heavy barrel . Many Eastern woodchuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weigh eleven and twelve pounds . The Eastern deer hunter or the Western mountain hunter would kill himself with such a heavy barrel . These big heavy barrels for sporting use sound a lot better in theory than they work out in practice . Barrels are made to many different contours . Sometimes they slope gradually down from the chamber and then have a straight taper from there on to the muzzle . Sometimes they come down abruptly . The German army had three steps in the Model 98 Mauser barrel . The theory behind this was that the steps controlled the vibrations and made for uniform shooting . Whether that is true or not I am not prepared to say . In muzzle-loading days barrels were made of soft iron , and  | even with the relatively cool-burning black powder , low pressures , and lead bullets the barrels wore out . It was a common thing for a man to start with a muzzle-loader of about .30 caliber . When it got pretty well worn , he would take it to a gunsmith to have the rifling recut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of a rifle this recutting or " freshing out " would be repeated until the barrel that started as a .30 might end up as a . q.o . In early black-powder days of factory rifle-production a soft carbon steel was used for rifle barrels . No great hardness was needed because pressures did not run over 25,000 pounds per square inch and lead bullets were not hard on barrels . Steel of more or less the same type is still used for many .22 barrels , because the .22 also uses lead bullets and low pressures . That is one reason why an old soft carbon-steel barrel can not be rechambered to some modern high-intensity cartridge even though the bore and groove diameter and twist are all right . With the hotter-burning powders , jacketed bullets , and high pressures those soft barrels will wash out in a very short time . For many years the standard steel for high-powered rifle barrels was a carbon steel known as " ordinance " steel . The Springfield arsenal used it . So did Remington and Savage . For many years the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was less sensitive to erosion and gave longer life to the barrel . As velocities and pressures have gone up , harder steels have been sought . For the last ten years Winchester has been using a heat-treated chrome molybdenum steel which is very hard and highly resistant to erosion . It is generally believed that this step was forced upon Winchester when they developed the .220 Winchester Swift . The first nickelsteel barrels washed out very quickly under the terrific heat and velocity . The tendency today among certain barrelmakers , particularly those who experiment with ultra-high-velocity cartridges burning great amounts of powder , is to use very hard heat-treated steel into which graphite has been incorporated . The trade name  | of one of those steels is " Graph-Mo . " Just how they are going to work out and whether they are markedly superior to chrome molybdenum is something I do not know . A famous steel in Europe that was used for barrels on the most expensive rifles was " Poldi Anticorro . " This special steel had a high chrome content . Presumably it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only Poldi Anticorro barrel that I have had any experience with , however , developed a nice case of throat erosion just about as rapidly as an ordinance-steel barrel would have done . This barrel was in .257 and plenty of hot loads were run through it . At one time the Winchester Repeating Arnis Company made a rust-resistant steel for barrels , known as Winchester Rustless steel . The barrels have been discontinued . They were very hard to machine , I understand , and they were actually so rustless that they could not be blued . Instead they had to be copperplated , and the copper turned black . After a little use they would look pretty speckled . BARREL LIFE Many correspondents want to know how long a barrel will last . That depends on many factors . If a barrel is kept clean and cared for , it of course never rusts out ? and rust , by the way , is the greatest enemy of rifle barrels . Instead the barrel first begins to show its wear at the end of the throat , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being bright and sharp-cornered , the lands begin to wear at the corners . They look abraded or " frosted . " A little later they begin to look noticeably dark and rough . This condition is caused by erosion . The powder gases push past the bullet at great pressure before the bullet upsets to seal the bore . These gases have a pressure of from 40,000 to 50,000 pounds in a high-powered rifle . They literally melt away the steel . Often this is complicated by the abrasion of unburned powder gas being pushed and dragged over the lands at terrific  | speed . As the erosion progresses further , it can be seen for a greater distance up the barrel . Pretty soon the careful marksman may begin to detect a falling off in accuracy . After a certain time the accuracy falls off so much that a new barrel should be obtained . I am convinced that this erosion can be slowed up to some extent by the use of graphite wads in hand loads . Theoretically , anyway , these wads seal off the gases and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upset and seals the bore . The wax and graphite of these wads probably deposits a thin coating on the steel and protects it to some extent . I do not use these wads in large-caliber rifles as a rule , but I have found that their use pays off in the hot .22 and .25 calibers , like the .220 Swift and the .257 Roberts . These wads also seem to protect the barrel of the lead alloy bullets when they are used and to give better accuracy . A rifle used in rapid fire so that it gets very hot will have a shorter barrel life than ordinary . The rifle used for testing purposes and to fire many ten-shot groups will also show a shorter barrel life . The ultra-high-velocity rifle that burns a lot of powder and forces it through a small bore with terrific velocity will show a shorter barrel life . Some of the super-Magnum calibers will shoot out a barrel in as few as three hundred or four hundred rounds . The ordinary .30/06 should show a good accuracy life to five thousand rounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because that powder gets a little hotter and moves through the bore a little faster . Actually , however , it takes a lot of shooting to wear out a barrel . Suppose each shot costs a dime , and the accuracy life of the barrel is five thousand rounds . That means that five hundred dollars ' worth of ammunition must be put through the barrel , which costs from twenty to fifty dollars ? and will cost that much to replace . With low pressures and lubricated lead bullets such as are found in the .22 a modern hard-steel barrel has an almost unlimited accuracy life .  | Cartridges , Powder , and Bullets ANY cartridge is composed of these elements : case , powder charge , primer , and bullet . As we have seen , the priming mixture of a rim-fire cartridge is contained within the folded head . In a center-fire cartridge the primer is separate . It is a pellet of priming compound of one sort or another confined within its own little brass container , which contains a built-in anvil . The firing pin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violently the priming mixture by forcing down the outside portion of the primer against the anvil . This blow sets off the priming compound ; the hot gases rush through the flash hole and cause the powder to begin to burn . The expanding gases from the burning powder force the bullet through the barrel and keep pushing it up the bore . American cartridge cases are made for the primer with the built-in anvil and the single flash hole . European cases use what is known as the Berdan primer . The Berdan primer has no anvil . Instead the anvil is at the bottom of the primer pocket , and European cases have two flash holes instead of one . Consequently American primers can not be used with European cases , and European cases can not be used with American-type reloading tools . It is very easy to punch out the primer of an American case , but very difficult to remove a Berdan-type primer from a European case . American center-fire rifle primers come in two sizes ? the  | so-called large rifle primer and the small rifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in diameter . The small rifle primer measures .175 inch . As a matter of fact , the large pistol and small pistol primers are the same size , but because handgun pressures run much lower than rifle pressures , pistol primers are made of much thinner and softer brass . They can not be used for full-power rifle loads because they would puncture and not stand the pressure . Furthermore , they are not " hot " enough to ignite a large powder charge . Formerly Remington and Winchester made large rifle primers which were less " hot " than the standard primers . They were used in such cartridges as the .250/300 , .257 , and .25/35 . Remington called theirs the No. 8 ? , and Winchester theirs the No. 115 . All have been discontinued . Federal Cartridge Company , long a loader of .22 rimfires and shot shells , went into the Primer business , as did Cascade of Lewiston , Idaho . Both produce rifle and pistol primers and also special hot Magnum primers . Small rifle primers are the Winchester No. 116 and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a larger odd-size .30/06 primer , which is no longer manufactured , but that was in the days when it was difficult to develop a non-corrosive primer strong enough for large-capacity cases . The .45 Colt Auto pistol cartridge loaded at government arsenals also used an odd-size primer . The famous Frankfort arsenal No. 70 primer was a large standard-size primer . Up until the late 1920 's all rifle primers contained potassium chlorate , which upon firing became potassium chloride , a substance akin to common table salt . The potassium chloride deposited in the bore of the rifle attracted moisture just as table salt does and caused rust . The tendency to rust was particularly marked in rifles of small-bore capacity like the . zz and .25/20 . It was almost impossible to prevent this rust and usually a barrel would be ruined in a few hundred rounds . For a long time the " acid fouling left by smokeless powder " received the blame . " In 19So the Remington No. and Winchester No. its primers were discontinued .  | When it was discovered that the potassium chlorate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that ingredient and which were " rustless . " The first successful noncorrosive mixture was Remington Kleanbore . However , most of these early non-corrosive mixtures contained mercury , and mercury causes brass to grow brittle . In the case of the .22 rimfire cartridge , which is not reloaded , this is unimportant , but handloaders could not use brittle cases that had been fired with mercuric primers . Before long , however , the various companies , led by the Winchester Repeating Arms Company , brought out primers that were both non-corrosive and non-mercuric . With a few exceptions , all center-fire cartridges are loaded with primers of this type today . They are more violent than the old chlorate primers of the Frankfort arsenal No. 70 type and less powder can be used than could be used with the old-type primers . POWDERS For many hundreds of years " gunpowder " simply meant a mechanical mixture of sulphur , charcoal , and saltpeter . This was the famous black powder . The rate of burning could be controlled only by the size of the grains , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powder was not ideal . It was very bulky for the amount of energy produced . It was dirty-burning and quickly fouled up a barrel , so that for best accuracy the barrel had to be cleaned every few shots , unless , as with the old muzzle-loaders , a greased patch for the bullet cleaned the barrel while the bullet was forced down the bore . Black powder also gives off a tremendous quantity of smoke , and often the game would be blotted out after the trigger was pulled . " Smokeless " powder began to displace black powder for sporting use in the late 189o 's , and about the same time rifle cartridges began to be designed for smokeless powder . The .30/40 Krag , the 7-nn . Mauscr , the .30/30 and the .303 Savage  | are all examples of these early cartridges designed for the first smokeless powder . The military men of the world took the lead in the use of smokeless powder because of the tremendous advantage armies with rifles that did not smoke would have . There are two principal types of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nitrocellulose . The powder containing nitroglycerin as well as guncotton is known as doublebase powder . The powders of the Hercules Powder Company are of this type . Hi-Vel No. 2 , the famous rifle powder , is a good example of a double-base powder . Such powders give higher velocities with lower pressures than do the single-base powders . They are somewhat more erosive on barrels , however , because they burn at higher temperatures . Single-base powders give longer barrel life . Powders are designed to be used at various pressures ? from 10,000 or 15,000 pounds in those to be used in a handgun cartridge to 55,000 pounds in powders designed for the .270 or .300 Magnum . Of necessity the powder used in a revolver must burn very quickly because of the short barrel and the low pressure , since a revolver can not stand the high pressures . On the other hand it is a great advantage in the case of a strong rifle to have the powder still delivering gas and accelerating the bullet when the bullet is far up the barrel . A rifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powder . Some powders are very flexible and , like the famous Hi-Vel No. 2 , will burn well at pressures from 30,000 to 50,000 pounds . Some powders are quite inflexible and burn efficiently only within a narrow pressure range . Hercules No. 2400 and Du Pont No. 4227 are small-grained powders for small-capacity rifle cartridges . A full charge of such powders in a case of the capacity of the .30/06 would blow up the strongest rifle ever made . On the other hand some powders are very slow-burning , and of the powders now in use Du Pont No. 4350 is the slowest burning of all . The rate of combustion of a powder is determined by its  | composition , the size of the grain , the perforation of the grain , and the coating . Some powders are made in the form of perforated rods so that the grains burn inside as well as out and continue to give off a steady flow of gas instead of the gas lessening as the diameter of the burning grain decreases . In a book of this sort one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should know that powders differ vastly and because a powder gives increased velocity in one cartridge it is no sign that it will in another . Often just the opposite is true . A slow-burning powder like Du Pont No. 4350 may give increased velocity with heavy bullets in a large-capacity case but much lower velocities in a smaller-capacity case . Some large-grained slow-burning powders can be put in a small case and not even burn . The changing around of powders is extremely dangerous . Many a rifle has been blown up because amateur reloaders have removed powder from shotgun shells or revolver cartridges and attempted to reload rifle cartridges with it . The selection of the proper kind of powder has a great deal to do with accuracy , as anyone who has experimented by reloading his own cartridges will testify . American powders are the best in the world , the only powder-makers who can compare with them being the Germans . Most of the increased efficiency in the older cartridges can be credited to the skillful technicians in American powder plants . A book or , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . There are powders for every class of cartridge ? powders to be used only in shotguns , powders to be used only in handguns , powders to be used only in small rifle cartridges , powders to be used in rifle cartridges of large capacity , powders that do their best work in a straight case , powders that are seen at their best in a bottleneck case . There are powders in the form of long rods of large diameter , in long rods of small diameter , in short rods of large diameter and of small diameter . There are flake powders and ball powders . The famous British cordite is a nitroglycerin double-base powder in the form  | of long cords . The powder is loaded into the case before the case is necked down . There are reasons for all of these differences in the appearance of powders , and no one should attempt to use a powder until he knows its characteristics . BULLETS The original bullet was simply a round ball of pure lead . Used in a smoothbore musket , such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped down on top of the powder charge . Of course such a bullet was very inaccurate , and in the days when the musket was the military weapon , opposing armies literally shot in each other 's faces so they would be sure of hits . Rifles were invented many years ago , but they were never popular for military use because pounding the bullet down into the tight rifling took too long a time . The American frontiersman solved this dilemma along in the eighteenth century by putting a greased buckskin or a linen patch around a ball that was about bore diameter and then pushing the ball down on top of the powder charge with one sweep of the ramrod . The greased patch cleaned out the fouling of the black powder each time ; then when the rifle was fired , the patch , which fitted tightly , caused the bullet to take the rifling and spin . As soon as the bullet and patch left the muzzle , the patch dropped off and the bullet went on its way , spinning so it would fly straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marksmen made during the Revolutionary War , the armies of the world did not adopt the rifle until about the time of the American Civil War . Then conical bullets with hollow bases were adopted . They were smaller than the bore , but the blow of expanding gases " upset " or expanded them to fill the bore to the depth of the grooves . The bullets for the early breech-loading rifles were of alloyed lead with grooves in them for some sort of lubrication so that the  | rifle barrel would not lead . Bullets were also wrapped with paper to serve the same purpose ? to keep the lead from rubbing off against the barrel . Sometimes these lead bullets were cast with hollow points ? or cavities in the noses . These bullets would expand when they struck flesh , and tear a much larger hole and give greater killing power than a bullet without this cavity point . These lead lubricated bullets are still seen in revolver cartridges . They are still cast at the factories in big gang molds that will cast from twenty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " inside lubricated " ; that is , the lubrication grooves are under the case so that the grease will not rub off if the cartridge is carried in the pocket . The ordinary .22 bullet is a lead bullet lubricated with grease . The hollow-point bullet is of the same sort that was used in the large-caliber express rifles of the 187o 's . Of late years , however , the cartridge companies have loaded .22 'S with dry wax as lubricant or they have copperplated the bullets . In either case the bullets do not have the annoying habit of picking up dust or grit . As far as the actual shooting goes , however , these bullets are as a rule not quite so accurate as the old-fashioned greased bullets and they are slightly harder on the barrel . With the development of smokeless powder , velocities took a decided jump and pressures rose . It was found that the greater heat of smokeless powder fused the bases of lead bullets and also that they would not stand high velocities , as they tended to strip in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cups fitting over the base of the bullet , were developed to protect the bases from the hot gases . Even at that , though , there is a limit to the speed with which even a lubricated , gas-checked bullet that has been cast of hard alloy can be driven . As a consequence , the early smokeless-powder cartridges like the 7-mm . Mauser , the .303 British , the .30/40 Krag , and the .30/30 Winchester were given jackets or envelopes of metal . If the bullets were intended for military use only , the forward por-  | tion was completely enclosed in metal and the base was usually left unprotected . The point of the bullet was left round because that was the form of bullet point used with the black-powder rifles . When the early smokeless-powder bullets were made for sporting rifles the base was enclosed with metal and the lead core was exposed at the front end . This is the familiar form of the soft-point bullet . Various metals have been used for bullet jackets . Popular for many years was a mixture of copper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some European countries were even made of mild steel . Velocities of early smokeless-powder cartridges ran from 1,800 to 2,200 footseconds and cupronickel jackets were entirely satisfactory . Shortly after the turn of the century , however , bullets were lightened and velocities speeded up . In 1905 the Germans adopted an 8-mm. bullet weighing 154 grains , with a sharp point , which they called " spitzer . " Instead of driving a 236-grain bullet at around 2,100 , they drove that 154-grain bullet at about 2,850 . The result was a much flatter trajectory and because of this a longer potentially deadly range . The Americans followed suit with a 150-grain bullet in the .30 caliber army cartridge , which had been adopted with a 22o-grain bullet in 1903 for the 1903 Springfield . The lighter bullet was given a velocity of about 2,700 foot-seconds , and this combination became the famous .30/06 . Then at that much higher velocity it was found that cupronickel jackets left much metal fouling . It would first be detected by lumps on the lands near the muzzle where the velocity was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accuracy fell off badly . For this reason all owners of high-velocity rifles in those days had to clean them periodically with ammonia dope ? a messy and annoying procedure . After the first World War the Western Cartridge Company of East Alton , Illinois , brought out a non-fouling jacket material of copper , lead , and zinc , known by the trade name of " Lubaloy . " Various other nonfouling jackets have been worked out and now cupronickel is no longer used except by the ultra-conservative English . The  | government uses a mixture of copper and zinc known as gilding metal , and even pure copper jackets are used . A certain amount of the jacket material rubs off in the bore now , but instead of building up in lumps , it leaves in the bore a very thin copper plating , which can be removed with a brass brush or with some ammonia dope like Winchester Crystal Cleaner . MODERN SPORTING BULLETS The sharp-pointed or " spitzer " type of bullet is the best for longer-range shooting with the modern high-velocity rifle because such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its energy farther than round-nosed bullets of similar weight . For short and medium ranges , however , this sharp point is not necessary , and most bullets for rifles of medium velocity like the .30/30 , .32/20 , etc. , are still made with round noses . A round- or flat-nosed bullet is necessary for rifles with tubular magazines because the bullet of one cartridge rests on the primer of the cartridge in front of it . A bullet with a hard , sharp nose might fire the primer when the rifle recoiled . An example of how a cartridge is handicapped by being used in a rifle with a tubular magazine is the Winchester .348 cartridge with a 150-grain bullet at a velocity of z , 880 . The nose of this bullet must be flat because of the magazine of the Model 71 rifle , and as a consequence the bullet loses its velocity with great rapidity . Most sporting bullets are made with flat bases , since over sporting ranges the front end of the bullet is far more important than the rear end . Once a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is the rear end of the bullet that is important , and various military bullets have been made with boattail or tapertail bases . Such a bullet is useful for machine-gun barrages at very long range , but the boattail does not form a good gas seal and with it barrel life is shorter . The 172-grain M-i bullet used by the United States Army be-  | tween the two World Wars had a nine-degree boattail base . It was decided , however , that the bullet was too hard on barrels and too difficult to manufacture in great quantities . It was abandoned before the second World War broke out . The famous 18o-grain Western boattail bullet has been abandoned because the boattail is of no advantage in sporting use , even though it was a good point for advertising and selling . All things being equal , the longer a bullet is in proportion to its diameter , the deeper it will penetrate into flesh and the better it will hold its velocity . This length in proportion to diameter is generally known as " sectional density , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bullet as compared to its diameter . Obviously a bullet made of bronze in proportion to one made of lead and jacketed with gilding metal would not have the same sectional density because it would be lighter even though the proportions were the same . The long , rather round-nosed bullet is best for use in heavy timber because the round-nosed bullet does not deflect nearly so much on twigs and branches as the sharp-pointed bullet . One can make a rule about like this : the lighter the bullet , the higher velocity , the sharper the point , the thinner the jacket , the more the bullet is deflected by brush . A round-nose or flat-point bullet with rugged construction and fired at moderate velocity will get through the brush on a straight line quite well , but the lighter , high-velocity , sharp-pointed bullet will be badly deflected . The bullet should not only strike the game but expand to rupture and destroy tissue and should yet penetrate into the vitals . Some animals are lightly constructed , with thin skins and small bones . Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones . Obviously the sort of bullet that is ideal for one type of shooting can not possibly be ideal for another . A bullet that will penetrate through the rib cage of a small whitetail deer or an antelope and then blow up in the lungs is likely simply to blow a saucer-sized hole on the shoulder of a moose or elk and wound painfully without killing . On the other hand , a bullet  | that gives good performance on an animal like a moose or an Alaskan brown bear would be apt to drive clear through a light , fragile animal like an antelope or a whitetail without doing much immediate damage . It is a strange paradox that a bullet that will perform ideally on a moose will only wound the much smaller whitetail . The tendency of a bullet to expand is controlled by several factors ? the speed at which it is traveling when it strikes , the thickness of the bullet jacket , the hardness of the lead core , the amount of lead exposed at the nose , or the character of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikes will expand much more violently than the same bullet traveling at 2,000 foot-seconds . A bullet encountering great resistance will expand quicker than one encountering a little resistance . Bullet design has been a serious problem . Early softpoint spitzer bullets for the .30/06 proved unsatisfactory for heavy game because they tended to go to pieces too rapidly . Often bullets have been designed with jackets that were too heavy , with hollow points that were too small . They would drive right on through light game without expanding enough . Hunters of the enormous African game like rhinos , hippos , and elephants have found that in most instances they can not use any type of expanding bullet because if they do they can not get sufficient penetration . Most hunters of these largest of all game animals in Asia and Africa use what we call full metal case bullets and what the Brit : ; h call " solids " to give maximum pentration through enormously heavy hide and in heavy bone . America , however , has no game of that class , no game on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Various schemes have been evolved to make bullets expand . As we have seen , the oldest is the soft point , but a soft-point spitzer bullet batters badly in the magazine from recoil . An obvious thing to do is to cover the soft point with a very thin jacket of sonic metal . That has been done in the Winchester pointed expanding bullets of .25 , .270 , and .30/06 caliber . Another scheme  | is to have a hollow in the point . The famous 18o-grain Western open-point bullet is an example of this . Various other bullets of round-nosed , semi-spitzer , and spitzer shapes have been made with this hollow point . Another scheme is to retain the hollow point and also retain the sharp point of the bullet by having a metal cap over the hollow point . This scheme has been utilized by various loading companies . The Remington Arms Company has long used a sharp-pointed bronze wedge thrust into the nose of the bullet . This famous " bronze point " expanding bullet is of a very effective design . When the wedge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splits the jacket , and opens it up . In recent years the loading companies have experimented with bullet construction in an attempt to get bullets that would expand quickly and easily up to a certain point and then expand no farther . The famous Peters belted bullet and the Remington Core-Lokt bullets have belts toward the forward end which stop the expansion at a certain point so that much of the base remains to drive on through the game . The rather complicated Winchester-Western Silvertip bullet is also a controlled-expansion bullet . The Core-Lokt bullets have soft points or hollow noses . The Silvertip is a soft-point with the point covered and protected by a thin jacket of nickeled gilding metal . Those two bullets are among the most satisfactory for all-round use . They expand up to a certain point and then drive on through . I have shot Remington Core-Lokt bullets clear through a moose from side to side and have found the bullets perfectly expanded under the hide on the opposite side . I have driven the 18o-grain CoreLokt bullet clear through both shoulders of a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite side . I have shot caribou with the Western Silvertip and have found the bullets under the hide on the far side . It is my impression that the CoreLokt will penetrate somewhat more deeply than the Silvertip , but with either bullet the penetration is entirely satisfactory even with the lightweight 13o-grain .270 bullet . For long-range open-country shooting at animals of light and  | medium weight the best bullet is the one that expands easily . The bullets with heavy jackets and small hollow points often do not expand satisfactorily on light game even when driven at high velocities . Many years ago I put three bullets into the chest of an antelope and the exit holes on the far side were no bigger than the bullets . No expansion of any sort took place . At various times bullets , now discontinued , have been put out that expanded very poorly on light game , just as bullets have been put out that penetrated very poorly on heavy game . One of the quickest-killing bullets I ever used was the Barnes 12o-grain soft-point spitzer bullet driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With it I shot about twenty whitetail deer and antelope and I believe every one I hit was dead before it struck the ground . Those bullets would blow up in the chest cavity and simply wreck it . I have never seen more deadly bullets for light game . One of the best-designed of all bullets to be used on light and medium game was the 13o-grain Winchester pointed expanding bullet for the .270 . As we have seen , that bullet has a soft point protected by a thin copper jacket . When that strikes at .270 velocities it expands violently , yet the last third of the bullet has a very thick and heavy jacket , which ensures good penetration . The choice of bullets , then , is something which should not be taken lightly . Not long before I wrote this I had a letter from a man who denounced the .348 Winchester cartridge . He said he had shot and wounded several deer and always had a long chase before he could dispatch the animals . He had been using the 250-grain Silvertip bullet on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 125 pounds . He was shooting those bullets through the deer with a minimum , of expansion . If he had used the 150-grain soft-point at much higher velocity , those deer would have been killed like dynamite . He was using a bullet designed for moose and grizzly on light animals . Often hunters use 22o-grain .30/06 bullets , designed for the deepest penetration , on small game with poor results . They then blame the cali-  | ber instead of themselves . Likewise they use light , high-velocity bullets that expand readily on the heaviest game and then protest at the results . Actually the construction of the bullet has more to do with penetration than weight and sectional density . A 220-grain .30/06 bullet with a thin jacket and a great amount of lead exposed at the nose will give poorer penetration than a strongly constructed 18o-grain .30/06 bullet like the Core-Lokt or Silvertip . The 13o-grain Silvertip and Core-Lokt .270 bullets will give much deeper penetration than slower 150-grain soft-point .270 bullets . The bullet , then , is an exceedingly important factor in the effectiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the word comes from the French cartouche ? were simply packets of cloth or paper containing a ball and powder . The shooter tore the packet open with his teeth , poured the powder down the muzzle , used the covering for wadding , then dropped or pounded the bullet down on top of it . The first metallic cartridges that contained primer , powder , case , and bullet all in one unit were rim-fires . The case was made of copper . The priming mixture was within the folded head that formed the rim . Gradually these larger rim-fire cartridges became obsolete and were replaced by rimmed center-fire cartridges with a separate primer , which was pushed into a primer pocket in the head of the case . As the necessity for stronger cases was seen , the heads were made thicker and were simply not folded . The con , entional .22 cartridge still has a folded head . For many years the case was made of copper , but when velocities were speeded up from i , 000 foot-seconds to over 1,3oo , it was found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oldfashioned and much softer copper . Rimmed cases have many advantages . The progress of the cartridge in the chamber is stopped by the rim . More of the case is supported by the chamber itself than with the later rimless cartridge . The rimmed case , however , does not work satisfactorily through the staggered Mauser-type box magazine , and the  | rimless case is really an evil forced upon the rifleman by the excellent Mauser action . To overcome this difficulty with the rimless case in which the rim does not project beyond the body of the case , two other types of cases have been designed ? the semi-rimmed case , in which the rim projects enough beyond the body of the case to stop its progress into the chamber , and the belted case , in which head space is controlled by a belt just forward of the extraction groove . Either of these cases will work through a Mauser-type magazine . Examples of the semi-rimmed case are the .38 Auto Colt , the 6.5 Arisaka , the old 6-mm . LeeNavy , and the old .280 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and .375 Holland &; Holland cases and the various wildcats designed from them . Besides the character of the rim , cartridges are classified by the shape of the case . Some cases , like the .22 for example , are straight . Some have a straight taper from the rim to the mouth . Others are bottleneck cases with the body of the case much larger than the neck . In addition the slope of the shoulder varies greatly . Some shoulders have a very gentle slope , some a very abrupt one . Experimenters have tried various curves and slopes of shoulder in an attempt to cause powder to burn more efficiently . Some cartridge cases have very thick " webs " and are made to withstand very high pressures . Some have much thinner webs . This should be taken into consideration by the handloader . Although the .257 case is simply a necked down 7-mm . Mauser case , the web of the .257 case is a good deal thicker than that of the 7-mm . The .220 Swift case , which was designed for pressures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web . It is fatal to use a case designed for moderate pressures with high pressures . For example , much trouble with ruptured webs has been encountered in using old .25/20 single-shot cases in such high-pressure cartridges as the 2-R Lovell . Most of the big old black-powder cartridges had straight cases , and as a consequence the case capacity in grains of black powder was usually given ? as in .45/70  | and .45/90 . Sometimes the case length was given in inches . Just so long as the caliber was correct , shorter cases , if they were perfectly straight , could be used in a longer chamber , just as a straight .38-caliber revolver case can be used in a longer chamber . For instance , the .38 Short Colt case can be used in the longer .38 Long Colt chamber . The .38 Long Colt case can be used in the still longer .38 Smith &; Wesson Special chamber and the .38 Smith &; Wesson Special case can be used in the .357 Magnum chamber . The introduction of the bottleneck case complicates matters , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a straight taper case can not be used in a straight chamber even though the bullets may be of the same size . Another example is the use of the .22 Short and the . z2 Long in the .22 Long Rifle chamber . Those cases vary only as to length . The .22 Short case is the shortest . The .22 Long takes the same case length as the Long Rifle , but the over-all length of the cartridge is shorter because the .22 Long uses a .22 Short bullet in a .22 Long Rifle case . The shape of the case has a great deal to do with the type and the amount of powder that can be used . The smaller the capacity of the case and the more nearly straight it is , the faster-burning the powder must be . For instance , a straight revolver case of relatively small capacity requires a small-grained fast-burning powder , which will give reasonably high velocity with very low pressure . The large-capacity bottleneck case requires a slowburning powder , which is most efficient at a much higher pressure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per square inch . Medium-capacity slightly bottlenecked cartridges of the .30/30 class give pressures of around 38,000 pounds per square inch . Medium-capacity slightly bottlenecked cartridges of the .30/30 class give pressures of around 38,000 pounds per square inch . The large-capacity greatly bottlenecked cases like the .270 , .30/06 , etc. , require much slower-burning powders because their pressures run around 50,000 pounds per square inch . It would be useless to try to burn powder designed  | for the .270 in a .22 Hornet case , and such powder would even give rather poor results in a .30/30 case . On the other hand , if one should fill a .270 case with powder designed for the .22 Hornet , the powder would detonate or explode instead of burning and blow the rifle up . Case Design . Let 's look at some of the factors in case design . In the first place the size of the head is important . If we were to design a cartridge for the Model 94 Winchester action as Winchester did when it brought out the .219 Zipper , the head size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made ? in other words , like the .30/30 , .32 Special , or .25/35 . The over-all length of the cartridge would have to be such that it could function through the particular magazine . That is why those enthusiasts who want the Savage Arms Corporation to bring out a Model qq Savage in .270 W.C.F. will be disappointed . The overall length of the .270 cartridge is simply too great . Because of the Model 99 magazine the .300 Savage cartridge had to be designed for an over-all length not greater than that of the .250/3000 . First , then , the designer of a case must fit it to some existing rifle action . Besides the breech pressure , which is equal in every direction , there is also a factor known as back thrust . All things being equal , the larger the area of the head of the case , the greater the back thrust on the face of the bolt or the breechblock . Even though the chamber pressure of the 2-R Lovell wildcat cartridge is high , the back thrust on the breech-block does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case . On the other hand , the back thrust on the face of the breech-block is quite high with the .348 Winchester cartridge because the head of the case is very large . Chamber pressures in the .348 actually run lower than they do in the little 2-R Lovell , but back thrust is enormously greater because of the very large head of the .348 case . There are many other factors in cartridge design . Let us go back to the .348 again . If we examine the cartridge case we notice that it is quite sloping . The sloping body of the case in combina-  | tion with a rather gentle shoulder angle makes for lower pressures . It also makes for easier extraction . For this reason cartridges designed for a lever-action rifle usually have to be given some slope to the body or extraction difficulties are encountered . This slope , however , which makes extraction easier , also increases the back thrust on the bolt of the breech-block . For this reason one should never fire a rifle of this type with an oily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from clinging momentarily to the chamber walls at the point of highest pressure and greatly increases this back thrust . Because of the camming action , bolt-action rifles of the Mauser type have much greater power to extract a fired case or to seat a fresh cartridge . As a consequence , cartridges for actions of that type can be designed with practically no taper of the body . This has its advantages . A case of this sort greatly decreases the back thrust of the bolt , and hence much higher pressures can be handled . As we have seen , a gentle shoulder slope decreases pressures , but it tends to cause the powder to burn in the rifling instead of in the cartridge case itself . This tends to increase throat erosion and shorten barrel life . As an example of this the .220 Swift as developed by Winchester gives shorter barrel life with its relatively gentle shoulder slope than do the " blown-out " or " improved " versions of the Swift with the sharper shoulder or such high-velocity 22 center-fire cartridges as the .22 Varminter or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder also seems to give somewhat better accuracy and to burn powder somewhat more uniformly . This is generally believed to be the reason why the Swift gives the best accuracy only with maximum loads , whereas the .22 Varminter is very accurate with almost any load . In recent years there has been a tendency on the part of experimenters to use exceedingly sharp shoulders ? 4o degrees or so . There is no doubt that these sharp shoulders create a turbulence within the case which consumes the powder there and  | gives higher velocity for less powder . It is also highly probable , however , that many of these experimental wildcat cartridges are developing very high pressures . There can be no other way to account for the fact that some of those cartridges will produce as high velocities as others with only two thirds of the amount of powder . This turbulence is producing high velocities , but probably very high pressures as well . The very sharp shoulder has the disadvantage that often cases are hard to seat because it is difficult for the camming action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit , something that is possible with the less abrupt shoulder . From what I have seen , I seriously doubt if a shoulder sharper than 28 degrees pays off . In the past , when the first smokeless-powder cartridges were designed , many of the necks were very long . Perhaps the best design is simply to have the necks long enough so that the longest bullets will not fit down into the powder space . Up to a certain point it can be said that the more powder used in relation to the bullet , the higher the velocity will be . Simply taking a case and necking it down to smaller caliber for a lighter bullet has resulted in many high-speed cartridges . One of the earliest high-velocity cartridges was the .22 Hi-Power as developed by the Savage Arms Company . It was a .25/35 case necked to .22 . The .256 Newton case was a .30/06 case necked to .256 , and the .270 Winchester case is simply the .30/06 necked down to .270 with the same slope of shoulder retained . The .220 Swift is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the .257 is the 7-mm. case necked to .25 . The .218 Bee case is the .25/20 repeater case necked to .22 , just as the wildcat 2-R Lovell case is the old .25/20 single-shot case necked to .22 . One would think , then , that the more powder capacity in relation to the bullet weight , the greater the velocity . Very early , however , it was discovered that there is such a thing as bore capacity . It is possible to use only about so much powder for a certain bore . Gases can get through an aperture of a certain size  | only so fast . Putting more gas behind that aperture simply raises pressures without raising velocity . Many years ago A. O. Neidner of the Neidner Arms Company developed a cartridge known as the .25 special or the .25/06 . It was simply the .30/06 case necked to .25 . Results were disappointing . In spite of the much greater powder capacity , the velocities produced were very little better than were obtainable with the .250/3000 Savage and its much smaller case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and over again . The .300 H. &; H. Magnum case necked to .22 did not produce velocities any higher than those of the .220 Swift with much smaller powder capacity . There also seems to be a relation between bore capacity and powder capacity as far as accuracy goes . For example , a powder capacity about like that of the .250/3000 case seems to be just about right for the high-speed .22 , and the case capacity of the .30/06 is right for a bullet of .270 or 7 mm . All things being equal , this relationship between case capacity and bore capacity seems to produce the best results . PRESSURE DOPE When a cartridge is fired , it generates pressures that act equally in every direction . As we have seen , they not only force the bullet down the bore , ' iut force the head of the case back against the bolt face , and the sides of the case against the chamber . There is no very good way to measure these pressures , in spite of the fact that pressure figures for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cartridges must be fired in a special pressure gun , which has a hole drilled through the barrel into the chamber . A steel piston is fitted into this hole . When the cartridge is fired , the pressure exerted operates this piston , which in turn crushes the little cylinders of lead ( which is used for low pressure ) and copper ( which is used for high pressure ) . The shortening of these crushed cylinders is measured in thousandths  | of a inch , and then a formula is used to translate this shortening into pounds per square-inch pressure . This method of determining pressures is by no means ideal . Some time a different method may be worked out . Pressures in shotguns run from 8,000 to 12,000 pounds per square inch . Ordinary revolver loads run around 15,000 pounds per square inch . The hottest handgun loads and loads for old black-powder rifles run up around 25,000 to 30,000 pounds per square inch . Permissible pressures for lever-action rifles run around 38,000 pounds per square inch , with the exception of cartridges for the .250/3000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds per square inch . Pressures for modern bolt-action rifles using good thick barrel cases run up well over 50,000 pounds per square inch . The size of a cartridge case does not necessarily have much to do with the pressures . For instance , the tiny .22 Hornet cartridge is loaded to the same pressure limits as the .30/40 Krag ? about 42,000 pounds per square inch . Some of the little .22 wildcats develop very high pressures . The limiting factor for pressures in the modern bolt-action rifle is not the rifle itself but the brass cartridge case . Even with the most modern cases , with plenty of brass , the safe pressure limit is still about 55,000 pounds . Many factories control the pressures developed in a cartridge case . All things being equal , the more densely the case is loaded , the higher the pressures will be . The finer-grained the powder , the higher the pressures will be . A case can be filled full of a large-grained slow-burning powder like Du Pont No. 4350 and then the bullet seated on it so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatsoever . If the bullet is not excessively heavy , the pressures will be within normal limits . On the other hand , if a fine-grained quick-burning powder like Du Pont No. 4227 or Hercules No. 2400 was used in that manner , the pressures would be terrific and would blow the rifle up . The sharper the shoulder slope , the higher the pressures will be , all things  | being equal . The greater the bearing surface of a bullet ? and by that is meant the portion of the bullet that comes in contact with the bore ? the higher the pressure will be . A hard , tough jacket on a bullet will cause higher pressures than a soft jacket . Modern non-corrosive primers develop high pressures themselves , and one can not use nearly so much powder safely with them as one could with the old potassium-chlorate corrosive primers . Different makes of cartridge cases of the same caliber vary in thickness and powder capacity . A load that would be perfectly safe in a case of one make might not be in a case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal about pressures . If the primer is completely flattened out , pressures are on the high side . If , in addition to this sign , the primer extrudes up around the firing pin , the pressures are too high . One of the first signs of too high pressures is extraction difficulty . The high pressure has literally glued the pliable brass case into the reamer marks of the chamber . This will also happen even with normal pressures if the brass case is too soft . Sometimes the gas will escape around the edges of a primer ? a condition known as " primer leak . " This is a sign of high pressure , or soft brass , or both . With many custom-made rifles , chambers are too tight , and in these a load that would be perfectly all right in a normal chamber will give pressures that are too high . A bullet seated too deeply will increas , pressures , and a tight throat will do the same thing . On the other hand , when the " leade " or the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall off and more powder can be used . A loose bore lowers pressures . Likewise a tight bore raises them . For example , the original Model 1917 Erifields were rifled oversize for the standard .30-caliber bullet . The groove diameter is about .311 . When .308 bullets were fired with ordinary .30/06 standard loads , they gave lower pressures in those old 1917 barrels than they did in the tighter standard .30/06 barrels in the 1903 Springfield , or in a Model 54 and Model 70 Winchester .  | The Rifle Stock THE rifle stock as it is seen on the American hunting rifle today is the result of a long evolution . At first the rifle stock was simply a handle to hold the gun barrel and mechanism , but very soon craftsmen began using fine wood and checkering and carving the stocks . Guns made many hundreds of years ago in Europe show painstaking care in stock work . Stocks on the distinctly American muzzle-loading " Kentucky " rifles for many years set the style in rifle stocks . They were designed to be used only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable weight . The butt plates were small and curved . The butt stocks themselves were quite thin and small considering the weight of the rifle . Drop at both heel and comb was excessive , making a Kentucky almost impossible to shoot in anything except the offhand position . Stock design of factory sporting rifles was derived from this Kentucky style , and for many years the stocks of most factory rifles had too much drop and they retained those little curved rifle-butt plates . In rifles of light recoil shot only from the offhand position they did reasonably well , but they were uncomfortable from sitting and from prone , and a rifle with heavy recoil became very painful to shoot because excessive drop accentuates recoil and the points of the rifle-butt plate dig into the shoulder . The stock for the Model 1903 Springfield is a very poor one ? too short and with excessive drop at both comb and  | heel . The British-designed stock for the 1917 Enfield is just about as bad . Stocks on many rifles of heavy recoil gave the shooter a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winchester in a .405 caliber was a terror and even the little Model 94 Winchester carbines in .30/30 kick out of all proportion to the foot-pounds of free recoil . A properly designed stock should have a comb high enough to keep the eye comfortably and firmly along the line of sight because the cheek pressed against the comb is a great aid in keeping a rifle steady . In fact , this comb height is one of the very important elements of stock fit . The well-designed stock should be reasonably straight with drop at heel of no more than one inch greater than drop at comb so that the recoil comes back in a straight line with a steady push instead of throwing the comb up to hit the jaw . The well-designed stock should have a correctly shaped pistol grip to support the right hand and leave the trigger finger free and uncramped to control the trigger . It should have a relatively full fore-end to aid in rapid swinging of the rifle and also to enable the shooter to take up some of the recoil with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock should support the barrel and dampen the vibration . Leveraction rifles , pump-action rifles , and most semiautomatics have two-piece stocks . This tends to give the rifle more or less of a hinge in the middle and it is one of the reasons why the average lever-action rifle is not as accurate as the average bolt-action . Winchester lever-action rifles have the butt stock held to the action with tang screws . The most rigid two-piece stock is that seen on the Model 99 Savage . The butt stock is held to the action with a long , strong screw passing through the butt stock . Modern American stock design began along about 1910 and the best type of stock as seen today is a process of evolution since that time . A handful of skilled marksmen were very discontented with the stocks on factory rifles . Among them were Colonel Townsend Whelen , the shooting writer and army ordnance officer , Stewart Edward White , the novelist , and the late  | Captain E. C. Crossman , gun editor . They bought Model 1903 Springfields from the army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks for the Springfield differed from the ordinary factory stocks in that they had flat , wide butt plates to distribute the recoil evenly over the shoulder , high combs , relatively straight butt stocks , and good hand-filling fore ends . Many of them also had cheek pieces which helped to support the rifle firmly because the whole cheek could be pressed against the butt stock . The ideas in those first custom stocks for the Springfield did n't take any too well , however . The first Model 30 Remington rifles , for example , had a rather terrible stock with a rifle-butt plate and a thin fore end . The first Model 54 Winchester stock did not have enough pitch down . The butt plate was too small , the curve of the pistol grip wrongly placed . Largely because of the squawks of the gun writers , the factories gradually improved their stocks . The later N.R.A . stock on the Model S4 Winchester was very good ? not perfect , but a vast improvement over the original stock for the Model 54 . The Remington Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the later 721 . The stock on the present Model 722 is also good . Although the original stock on the Model 1920 was a very sad affair , that on the later Model 40 was excellent . Stocks on lever-action rifles have also been vastly improved . For use with iron sights , the stocks on the Model 71 Winchester and the Model 64 Deer Rifle are hard to beat , and so is the stock on the Model 99 Savage R and R-S . With scope sights the combs should be higher than they are , but the factory rifle must be stocked for use with iron sights . As it stands now , the average man with no marked peculiarities of build who shoots in the conventional manner will be pretty well fitted with most of the factory stocks . The ideal stock simply puts the eye quickly into the line of sight and holds steady in any position . The ideal stock is also so  | pitched that recoil is minimized . Obviously , human beings differ a great deal in build and shooting habits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for everyone who shoots it . Really good design , however , is more important for the average man than the stock dimensions themselves in the way of length of pull and so on , because everyone can adapt himself to some extent to a stock . As we have seen , the well-designed stock should have a comb high enough to support the cheek so that the eye will look right through the sights . This comb of proper height saves that split second when the whitetail buck jumps up and wastes no time in getting out of sight . That high comb is very important in accuracy because it gives a four-point suspension of the rifle ? butt against the shoulder , cheek against the comb , right hand around the grip , left hand on the fore end . Actually , for most rifle shooting the right hand , shoulder , and cheek do most of the work . The rifle should be pulled firmly to the shoulder with the right hand against the pistol grip . It is always a mistake to try to pull the rifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for swinging a rifle rapidly when shooting at running game , the fore end can simply lie against the heel of the left hand . With this in mind we can see that the pistol grip should be well curved so the hand is in a natural , uncramped position and can exert the backward pressure to keep the butt firmly against the shoulder . The tendency is to make pistol grips too large . The average hand is best fitted with a pistol grip of about 43/4 inches in circumference and almost round but slightly oval in crosssection . The comb should be enough higher than the front part of the grip to keep the thumb out of the nose , and the base of the thumb should be firmly against the curve of the comb . The thumb should always be around the grip , by the way , as this is much more secure than having the thumb alongside the grip . The reason so many people shoot with the thumb alongside the grip is that they were trained with the poor stock of the old 1903  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to shoot with the thumb around the grip they were apt to get smacked in the snozzle . The angle at which the butt plate is fitted on the butt is very important . This is called pitch and it is measured from the muzzle as shown in the illustration . The pitch should be such that the butt remains firm at the shoulder in any position , with no tendency to slip either up or down . Too little pitch tends to make the butt slip down below the armpit . Too much pitch down from the muzzle tends to make the butt slip up . There is nothing mysterious about pitch . Its whole purpose is to keep the rifle firm against the shoulder . The pitch down should be somewhere between 3 and 41/2 inches , depending , of course , on the length of the barrel ( as pitch is measured from the end of the barrel ) and the straightness of the stock . Pitch that departs from these two figures is usually not satisfactory . Drop is measured from the line of sights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect for iron sights is far too much for scope sights . The rifle that is to be used with both scope and iron sights will have to be stocked as a compromise . If the comb is too low the cheek is not supported , and this triangle of butt at the shoulder , right hand at the pistol grip , and cheek at the comb is broken up . If the comb is too high , so that the cheekbone has to be pressed hard against it to force the eye into the line of sight , the rifle becomes very unpleasant to shoot . If the recoil is heavy at all the cheek will be painfully bruised . Ordinarily a drop from line of iron sights at comb of about 1% to 1% inches is about right for the average man . Drop at heel should be around i inch more , or 2 %8 to 2 % . For a rifle to be used only with scope sights the same figures apply . With the bolt-action rifle , however , to be used with scope sights only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawal of the bolt will permit . I believe also that the rifle to be used with scope sights only should be " straighter , " with less difference in drop between comb and heel . I like only %2 inch difference . That  | is a very straight stock , but it handles well for me . This straight stock means that even if the face is n't put at the same place each time , there is n't much difference in the actual drop as far as where the cheek goes . The straighter the stock also , the less the apparent recoil because the straight stock brings recoil back in a straight line instead of accentuating it as a crooked stock does . Some hunters have stocks made with Monte Carlo combs , which simply means that the comb goes back absolutely parallel for some inches and then drops off to give more drop at the heel . For my part I have never cared for the appearance of the Monte Carlo comb , although some prefer it . A cheek piece not only improves the appearance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire side of the face can be placed firmly against the stock . Some cheek pieces are more ornamental than useful . The one on the old super-grade Model 70 Winchester and the equally fine Winchester Model 52 sporter looks like a limp pancake wrapped around the comb . It is too thin to do any good . The cheek piece should be flat . It should be thick , projecting at the bottom of the stock about 1/2 to % of an inch . It should be of the Scheutzen type , which merges into the comb . If it is o : the common English type it is no good for the stock crawler who thrusts his head as it puts a sharp edge right against the cheek . In recent years there has been a tendency to make fore ends too large , heavy , and bulky , just as there was once a marked tendency to make them too small and skinny . The fore end should be more or less pear-shaped in cross-section , but even a perfectly round fore end is not bad . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rifle has to be swung rapidly at big game . A fore end shaped like this and about r % inches in diameter is very neat and also surprisingly adequate . Possibly a fore end of that type 11/2 inches in diameter is a little better . Just now it is the fashion to put a black fore-end tip on a rifle . Sometimes these tips are made of some plastic like Bakelite , others of white plastic or ivory . The British , from whom we got this fash-  | ion , use East Indian buffalo horn and do a brisk trade in it . The best-looking fore-end tip is simply a round continuation of the fore end and not the snobble formerly seen on many rifles . Most factory stocks are quite satisfactory for the average man if iron sights are used . If scope sights are to be used exclusively , all of them have too much drop at comb and heel . Right now the only remedy for the man who wants to get a factory rifle and use it exclusively with scope sights is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is an expensive remedy although it is the only complete solution . It is also possible to get a lace-on cheek pad to raise the comb , but this is a makeshift and one that destroys the smart appearance of the rifle . With the continued growth in popularity of the scope sight , a factory probably will bring out two models of stocks ? one for iron sights and one for scope sights only . Lines of a stock are difficult to describe ? almost as difficult to describe as the difference between the features of a beautiful woman and those of a homely one . In spite of this difficulty and the fact that the measurements of the features would be in small fractions of an inch , almost everyone knows this difference . It is the same way with stocks . The handsomest stocks are things of sweeping beauty . Equally well-fitted stocks may be bulky and ugly . The art of stock shape and design that combine beauty with utility is a very high one . The average man is quite well fitted with a stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center of the trigger to the center of the butt plate ) of from 13 % to 131/2 inches . The tendency on the part of the man who does n't know much about stocks is to think he wants a longer stock than he ought to have . The short man will be very well off with a i 3-inch stock and most men will be better fitted with a 131A-inch stock if they plan to shoot the rifle in cold weather when they are bundled up in many layers of clothing . A boy or a woman can use a stock even shorter than I 3 inches . As a matter of fact , a stock of 123/4 inches is not bad at all for a small woman . As we have seen , then , a man from S feet  | 6 inches to 5 feet io inches or so should have a stock of from 131/4 inches to 13 %2 inches . The six-footer can take a somewhat longer stock ? usually 13% to 13% inches ? and the very tall man with exceedingly long arms can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole we can say that because of the different methods of mounting and handling a gun the rifle stock should be from 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch shorter than the shotgun stock , and of course it should have more pitch down . The average American factory stock is made from plain American walnut with little figure in it . American walnut is good stock material although it is not the finest . The very best stock material is European walnut from trees of the thin-shell " English " variety . Wood of this type comes under various names , depending upon the locality from which it is presumed to have been imported ? English , French , Italian , and Circassian . In years past the very finest walnut stock blanks have presumably come from the Circassian district of the Caucasus Mountains , but the bulk of the fine walnut used by the best makers in Germany , England , and the United States has come from the Rhone River section of France . Imported into the United States , even though they are duty-free , the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a rather plain one to as high as fifty dollars or even more for a superlatively figured one . European walnut has more contrast than American walnut . Its colors range from black to light yellow , with intermediate yellowish and reddish browns . It takes checking better and will hold much finer diamonds than American walnut . Another excellent wood for stocks is maple . It is rather light in color , but if it is touched up with a blowtorch to increase the contrast ? a process known as the Japanese " Suigui " finish ? an ornate and complicated figure results . A well-marked wood known as Oregon myrtle is also used for gunstocks . So are apple , cherry , and mahogany , and in the Southwest even mesquite . But the finest of all gunstock materials is the thin-shelled European variety of walnut . In the past few years many English walnut  | groves in California have been cut down . Much of the wood has been sliced very thin to be used as veneer for furniture , but a good deal of it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as fine as the finest that have ever come out of Europe . Good checkering on the rifle stock adds greatly both to beauty and to utility . On factory stocks checkering runs from 14 to i8 lines to the inch . Much of it is sloppy , carelessly done , fuzzy . Fine custom stocks made of hard , fine wood are generally checkered 24 to 26 lines to the inch . Some crack stockers like Al Biesen of Spokane , Washington , recess their checkering patterns about 1/16 inch . The effect is very handsome . Right now there is a fad for French-skip or " basket-weave " checkering . I do not care for it . Fine , precise checkering with small diamonds filed up sharp and uniform is generally an indication of the class of a stock . Since the war some pretty terrible-looking stocks , both factory and custom-made , have come on the market . Many of the stock shapes are bizarre and there has been a fad to inlay them with contrasting wood , ivory , mother-of-pearl and to carve them with portraits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clad but well-endowed maidens , and slavering grizzlies . To me this is like the useless chrome , tail fins , and junk on massproduced automobiles , and I want no part of it . A fine custom stock costs money , as the making of a custom stock is handwork and handwork takes time . Before the war it was possible to get a fine custom stock for about $75 plus the cost of wood and fittings , and in those days a stock blank of good French walnut cost about $ 10 and the very finest about $25 . A stock job the late Alvin Linden did for me back in the middle 193o 's cost me , all told , I believe , about $85 . Now a good custom stocker will charge from $200 to $275 , or even more for a complete stock if he furnishes wood and fittings . To inlet , shape , finish , and checker a stock takes about a week 's steady work . A fair French walnut blank costs at least $50 . There have never been more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The firm of Griffin &; Howe , the Holland &; Holland of the United States , has employed some excellent stockers and has turned out some beautiful rifles . Most of their workmen have been from the Old World . Many of the old-time American stockers have gone to the land where all wood is hard , well figured , and cuts clean . Adolph Minar has been dead almost thirty years . Alvin Linden died during the war , Bob Owen about 1956 . What has happened to Bob Hutton and John Wright I can not say . Like John Dubiel , also dead , they were English . August Pachmayr is very old , and so is Tom Shelhamer . However , members of a new generation of American stockmakers are doing the finest stock work in the world , far better than anything I have seen come out of England or the Continent since the war . Alvin Biesen of Spokane , Washington , is a meticulous and uncompromising stocker in the classic tradition . His stocks for big-game rifles are superbly inletted , beautifully shaped , flawlessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mews of Appleton , Wisconsin , is another superb stocker . He departs more from the classic tradition than does Biesen , since he once stocked for Weatherby and got the California virus in his blood . Lenard Brownell of Sheridan , Wyoming , is yet another top hand who stocks in the classic manner . Anyone planning to make his own stock or go more deeply into the subject can do no better than to buy Alvin Linden 's three booklets on stock-making . They are published by Thomas G. Samworth of Georgetown , South Carolina . Clyde Baker 's book Modern Gunsnaithing , although it came out thirty years ago , has excellent material on stock design . It is likewise a Samworth publication .  | What Is Accuracy ? THE word accuracy means as many different things to different people as , let us say , those other very general words , beauty and virtue . One man has a rifle that he says is " accurate , " meaning that now and then he actually hits something with it because the stock fits him fairly well and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man is an experimenter and bench-rest shooter . To him a rifle is not accurate unless it will group ten shots into a one-inch circle at one hundred yards . For varmint hunting , where the man behind the rifle will try to take the very small mark that is a crow or a prairie dog at 200 yards or more , accuracy is of prime importance . It is also important for the long-range big-game hunter who may have to knock over his antelope at four hundred yards . For big-game hunting at short and moderate ranges , gilt-edged accuracy is not important , because practically any sort of rifle is accurate enough for a deer , moose , or elk 's vital areas at from twenty-five to a hundred and fifty yards . There are various kinds of accuracy . One is simply the ability of a given rifle and load to place the bullets in a small group at a given range . Old black-powder cartridges like the .32/40 and the .38/55 had this grouping ability in a superlative degree . Yet this ability merely to group does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let us say . Both have too curved a trajectory . At long and unknown  | WHAT IS ACCURACY ? ranges they are not accurate because one can not hit with them . This is not the fault of the inherent grouping ability of the rifle and cartridge but of too much departure of the bullet from the line of aim . The cartridge with the curved trajectory , then , although it may have grouping ability , does not have practical hunting accuracy . In its broader aspects accuracy is not only the ability to shoot small groups at known ranges , but also the ability to hit at unknown ranges . Such a cartridge as the .38/55 is indeed a good grouper , but as far as practical field accuracy goes it can not sit at the same table with such a cartridge as one of the fine .22 wildcats like the .22/.25o , which has a very flat trajectory . Surely another aspect of practical field accuracy is the ability of a bullet to buck wind . What avails it if a certain cartridge will group under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little puff of breeze will blow the bullet two or three inches out of the group ! As far as results go , it is better to have a cartridge that will group into four inches at that distance and buck wind than to have one that will shoot into two inches on a still day and yet get blown off . Still another aspect of accuracy is the ability of a rifle to shoot into the same group with various weights of bullets and charges and kinds of powder . Some rifles will shoot practically anything into a six-inch group at two ht.ndred yards . Others , although they may shoot small groups with one particular brand and lot of ammunition , will shoot different brands and lots all over the paper . Once upon a time I had a beautiful 7-mm . Mauser that illustrates many of the things I am trying to point out . It was really a good grouper and on a certain day with a certain load it could be depended upon to keep its shots in a bit less than two inches at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ammunition , even though I used the same weight of bullet at presumably the same velocity , the group enlarged greatly . Furthermore , that was the darnedest rifle to change point of  | impact that I have ever seen . It never shot in the same place on two consecutive days . Under ideal conditions that rifle would group , but was it accurate ? I 'll say it was n't ! For the moment let us discard all aspects of accuracy except the ability to group , which , as we have seen , is only part of the picture . In this respect accuracy is only another word for uniformity , and the more uniform the ammunition is , the more accurate it is . Ideally , each bullet should weigh exactly the same and should be of exactly the same diameter . Each jacket should be of the same degree of hardness . Points and bases should be perfect . The hardened and enthusiastic group shooters weigh and spin each bullet they use to see that they are uniform and they segregate bullets according to weight into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as 2.5 grains plus or minus . In other words , a bullet that is listed as weighing 150 grains may weigh 147.5 grains or 152.5 grains . One would naturally expect some variation in accuracy between the two extremes . Not only should the bullets be uniform , but the powder charges also . Powder measures , whether those used by the handloader or by the loading companies , will vary from %2 to 2 %2 grains in the charges they throw with the coarsest-grained powders like Hi-Vel No. 2 and No. 4350 . These variations will of course make a difference in point of impact , particularly at the longer ranges , and good match ammunition should have each powder charge individually weighed . Cases also differ in thickness and therefore in powder capacity from lot to lot and from make to make . A given power charge will give greater pressure and higher velocity in a small case than in a large one ; and this variation will show up on the target . Those wanting the smallest groups weigh cases and segregate them according to weight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thicker the brass and the smaller the capacity . The tension of the bullet in the neck also has an important bearing on accuracy and uniformity . Match ammunition is rigor-  | ously tested for uniformity of bullet pull . A certain number of bullets from each thousand loads is pulled . If the pull is not uniform , the whole lot will be demoted down to cooking ammunition . As cases are fired , the necks stretch and lengthen , and some flow and thicken . If a man tries to shoot minimum groups with a mixed lot of cases , some of which have been fired once and some twenty times , he is going to be disappointed . As we have seen , this business of getting accurate and u'ni f orm ammunition alone is very important and enormously complicated . But accuracy just begins there . The bore itself should be straight and uniform , with no high and low spots . The famous " star-gauged " barrels turned out at the Springfield arsenal were simply barrels that had been measured with a special gauge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action should lock the cartridge up tight and uniformly and center the bullet in the leade . The barrel should be straight so that as it heats up it will not begin to unkink and " walk " the group . It should be of such a contour and weight that it vibrates uniformly with slight variations of bullet weight and powder charge . It is of enormous importance that the barrel and action be bedded correctly in the stock , with the recoil shoulder of the receiver snug and true against its recess in the stock . A warping stock , which will warp against the fore end , then away , bear against the left side of the barrel , then the right , will mean a constantly shifting point of impact from day to day . The question is often asked if a light barrel can be as accurate as a heavy one . The answer is that barrel weight is just one of many factors affecting accuracy . A good uniform and straight light barrel will outshoot a poor heavy barrel . It is true , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the less sensitive it is to poor bedding and to variations in loads because it vibrates less violently . It is also true that the rifle with a heavy barrel is less sensitive to variations in sling tension and methods of holding .  | Nevertheless , a light job with a good barrel will shoot right along with heavy rifles , especially for the first three or four shots . For target work , where long strings of shots are fired and it is essential that the tenth shot wo n't land very far from the first one , the heavy barrel has it all over the light one . For biggame hunting , where it is seldom that more than three shots are fired at an animal , but where a rifle is often carried in a day many miles over the roughest of country , the light rifle will acquit itself nicely . The same thing is true of the varmint rifle . If the rifle is to be carried for long distances , as in Western coyote and jackrabbit hunting , the light rifle is the thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , the Eastern woodchuck and crow hunter who does most of his shooting out of a car can have a heavier rifle built . For many years there has been a controversy between riflemen whether a barrel should " float " or not ? in other words , whether it should be free of the fore end , so the fore end does not touch at any point . Probably the heavy barrel had best be left free-floating , and the barrels of most target rifles are so made . However , the light barrel should be bedded so that the barrel touches the barrel channel for about an inch forward of the receiver and is then freed up to a point just back of the fore end . There the fore end should bear against the barrel with a slight upward pressure of four or five pounds . I have yet to see a freefloating light barrel that shot particularly well , whereas many light rifles with barrels bedded as I have described will shoot like a house afire . Some gunsmiths bed the barrel snug the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This seems to work out very nicely , particularly if the wood has no tendency to warp hard against the stock . If the fore end bears against the barrel , it is of primary importance that the stock should have the wood so cut that the grain is diagonal with the barrel and does not have the tendency to warp hard .  | Good Bedding Is an Extremely Important Factor in Accuracy . Some cartridges are more accurate than others . Sometimes this is because a certain cartridge may not be particularly popular and not many pains are taken with it , whereas another cartridge may be made to much more rigid specifications . The .220 Winchester Swift cartridge , for example , is made to very rigid specifications , and that is one of the reasons why it is so accurate . The .32 Winchester Special is purely a deer cartridge . It is not held to such rigid specifications and hence does not give particularly good accuracy . Once upon a time the .30/06 cartridge was the leader in the big-game hunting and target field and great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , fewer pains seem to be taken with .30/06 ammunition , and ordinary factory loads are not so accurate as formerly . Some cartridges are inherently more accurate than others . It has been my observation that the cartridges in which the bore has been brought down to a much smaller diameter than the body usually show pretty good accuracy . Furthermore , they seem to put various powder charges and bullet weights , all things being equal , into a better group than cartridges in which bore and body are more nearly the same size . Add to this a fairly sharp shoulder and the result is usually an inherently accurate cartridge . There are certain cartridges that seem to have " balance , " where bore capacity and powder capacity are about right . The .270 will usually shoot a bit better than the equivalent .30/06 . The .30/06 case is under .3o-caliber bore capacity , whereas the .270 bore is about right for the case of the .30/06 capacity . The .250/3000 and the .257 Roberts are about right in the relationship of bore and powder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work out good loads for than the .257 , probably because it is more nearly exactly right in bore capacity . Anyone who has done much handloading knows that some combinations of powder charge and bullet just naturally make more accurate loads than others , probably because of the cleaner  | and more uniform burning of powder . Some experts believe that the one most important factor in accuracy is the correct charge of the correct powder . Let us take the .270 , for instance . A good many years ago I tried out different powders and different charges with the Winchester 13o-grain pointed expanding bullet . I soon decided that No. 3031 powder was hopeless . It seems to be too quick burning for best results in the .270 case . I also decided that No. 4320 , although good , was not quite good enough . No. 4350 shot like nobody 's business with the 150- and 16o-grain bullets , but it did not close those groups up as much as I 'd like to see with the 13o-grain . No. 4064 gave me good results from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 49.5 , 50 , 50.5 , and 51 grains , and of all the loads my best groups were obtained with 49.5 grains of No. 4064 . That load shoots well in any .270 I have ever tried it in , so evidently No. 4064 is the right bullet powder for the .270 . As a rule slightly better accuracy is obtained when the bullets are seated so they almost touch the lands of the rifling . I have always got better results with this method than when the bullet is seated so it is jammed hard into the rifling and better than when the bullet has to make a jump to engage the lands . On the other hand , the free-bored rifles of Roy Weatherby , California gunmaker , give fine accuracy , and I have seen .220 Swifts with all the rifling gone four or five inches up the barrel that still have good accuracy . The best rifle in the world wo n't shoot unless the correct rate of twist is employed in the barrel . The longer a bullet is , the more rapid the twist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullet , the slower the twist . The higher the velocity , the slower the twist can be . The ideal twist or pitch of rifling should be just enough to stabilize the bullets at the longest ranges at which they will be shot . If the twist is too slow and the bullet spins too slowly , the bullet will tumble or keyhole in the target . If the bullet is ovcrstabilized the accuracy is poor .  | The .30/06 has a standard twist of one turn in ten inches because it was desired to stabilize bullets to one thousand yards . Actually a pitch of I-I2 will usually result in better accuracy and is sufficient to stabilize even the long 22o-grain bullets over game ranges . The Ioo-grain .270 bullet at 3,540 is enormously overstabilized with the standard I/Io twist , and for the .270 the best all-around twist is 1 ? 1 2 . It will stabilize even the 150-grain factory load . A .300 Magnum will give excellent accuracy with a twist of I-14 , and the Swift or Varminter with 1 ? 16 or I-14 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I4 twist is best . But all this talk of accuracy is of no avail unless the sights are such as to enable the man behind the rifle to see . Put a big gold bead on an open rear sight on the finest , most accurate rifle in the world , and a group of 4 inches at one hundred yards is a good one . Put a good peep sight and a blackened blade front sight on the same rifle , and the group will be cut down to 21/2 inches or so because the error of aim is less . Take the same rifle and put a 2-x hunting scope with crosshair reticule on it , and the group will be about 2 inches . A four-power scope will reduce the error of aim by half , an eight-power will halve it again . In small-bore shooting , where the boys who win keep all their shots in the 2-inch 10 ring at one hundred yards with most of them in the 1-inch X-ring , scopes of ten , fifteen , and even twenty power are used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things ? of bullet , case , and powder charge , of barrel , of stock , of sights ? of so many things that it would take two walruses to think of them .  | IIRON sights have taken many and often exceedingly fanciful forms . Actually very few people understand the principles that operate in the use of the sight , as shown by the fact that some of the worst sights are the most popular . There are two types of iron sights ? the open sight and the aperture or peep sight . The open iron sight has to be a considerable distance from the eye , or approximately one third of the way down the barrel . The peep sight has to be relatively close to the eye . Sometimes the peep is mounted on the tang of the rifle . Sometimes it is attached to the receiver and sometimes to the cocking piece of a bolt-action rifle . The ordinary front sight is a bead of some kind ? gold , ivory , or red plastic ; but for military and target use the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top . The earliest rear sights were simply pieces of metal with notches cut in them so the front sight could be aligned in the notch . This type of open sight is still found on the majority of rifles as they leave the factory . A sight of this sort is cheap and easy to make , requiring little labor or material . It is the sight with which most people do their first shooting . The ordinary open rear sight may have either a V notch or a U notch . It usually has crude steps for elevation . Sometimes the V 's are quite narrow . Sometimes they are wide and shallow . Sometimes these sights have white diamonds or triangles which presumably direct  | the eye to the middle of the V. The British are very fond of a shallow V rear sight with a thin platinum line . Usually British rifles come with what is known as the express rear sight , with a whole battery of leaves of various heights for various ranges from ioo to 400 or 500 yards . A favorite open sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sights is the strange contraption known as the Rocky Mountain rear sight . In this two big ears jut far up above the sighting V. Those ears do nothing except to blot out the light and obscure the target . It is a strange thing that many people feel that if a sight is easy to use , it probably is n't any good , and the more difficult it is to see through a rear sight , the better it is . The Rocky Mountain buckhorn is undoubtedly the most fantastically bad rear sight ever designed . Second honors for the poorest sight go to the semibuckhorn , which differs only in degree . The best type of open rear sight is the very shallow V such as the sights seen on British double rifles . Another good type of open rear sight is simply a flat bar with a white triangle forming the aiming point . The most accurate type of open rear sight is like the one used on the old 1903 Springfield . It is the " patridge " where the square post can be seen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flat front blade on the level with the top of the sight , and space is seen between the sides of the square U. Both horizontal and vertical aim can be nicely controlled with a sight of this type , and rather small groups can be shot with it . The fastest of all open sights is the shallow V. The British , who have had more experience shooting large and dangerous game in Africa and India than any other people , swear that these sights are faster for close range work than any other . Whether that is a fact or simply the famous British conservatism , I do not know . Open sights have decided disadvantages . In the first place the use of the open sight is asking the eye to focus on three places at once ? on the rear sight from eighteen to twenty inches from the eye , on the front sight , thirty-six inches or so from the eye , and on the game , which is anywhere from ten to several hundred  | yards from the eye . It requires no genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes with great powers of accommodation can make a pretty fair stab at it . Middle-aged eyes which have lost their powers of accommodation find it impossible . There comes a time in the life of every man when the rear sight begins to fuzz up and he says : " I ca n't cut them as fine as I used to . " Then he must go to the aperture type of rear sight or to a scope . The open rear sight also has a very bad fault in that it has a tendency to make the hunter shoot high under conditions of poor light or excitement . With quick shooting it is almost impossible not to shoot high , and the open sight is to blame for that ancient adage : " Always hold low on deer . " There is nothing in particular about a deer that causes one to shoot high , but there is about the ordinary open sight . When the hunter is excited he does not draw the front bead down as fine as he does when shooting at a target . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This tendency of the rear sight to make the maintaining of elevation difficult is a bad one . In poor light it is difficult to see the front bead when it is brought clear down into the bottom of the notch because the deeper the notch and the sharper the V , the poorer the light at the bottom . The hunter , then , wo n't draw down fine enough , because he wants to see that front sight and he shoots over . Couple all this with the fact that the ordinary rear sight is only crudely adjustable and one can see that it is no bargain . A great many people act under the assumption that the rifle they receive from the factory is correctly sighted in for them . Sometimes it is , but most times it is n't , as no one can do an exact job of sighting a rifle in for anyone else , particularly with open sights . Rifles shoot to various points of impact with various brands of ammunition and weights of bullets . Different people have different ways of holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; another may habitually draw a coarse bead . Consequently a sight should be adjustable and every man should sight  | his rifle in for himself . With the ordinary open sight the notches on the elevation steps have a value of from four to six inches per hundred yards or range or from eight to twelve inches at two hundred yards . Windage is obtainable only by knocking the base of the rear sight over in the slot . As can be seen , this is a very crude method of adjustment and it is seldom that a rifle can be sighted in with ordinary rear sights right on the nose . Probably the best use for the open rear sight is as an auxiliary sight to be left on a rifle that is mounted with a scope , as other sights are so much better . APERTURE SIGHTS Optically the aperture sight is far superior to the open rear sight . It is designed on the optical principle that the eye naturally centers the front sight at the point of strongest light , which is always in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one should ignore the rear sight entirely and instead look through it , put the front sight on what one wants to hit , and squeeze the trigger . The aperture sight should be seen completely out of focus as a hazy and shadowy rim . One should not attempt to center the bead within it . The eye does that naturally and instinctively . As we have seen , the aperture sight is by far the best type of iron sight for the middle-aged man because he does not have to focus on it as he does on the open rear sight . His powers of accommodation are enough so that he can bring the front sight and the game into fairly sharp focus by simply seeing them through the rear sight . Beginners with aperture sights always make two mistakes . In the first place they are appalled when they discover how much they can see through a rear aperture of this size . They can see the world , they think , and all that is in it . Used as they are to the difficulties of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never do . As a consequence they want to screw in one of  | the little target disks to cut down the field and block out the light . That is what I wanted to do myself . I had to experiment and argue with myself before I could bring myself to take out the target disks when hunting . Those target disks have their place . They sharpen the field slightly and the rifleman can make a slightly smaller group with them on a black and white target than with a large aperture . This difference , however , is not so great as one would believe . I have tried it on a target with a .30/06 Springfield with a Lyman 48 receiver sight and I found I could shoot about 2 %2-inch groups from a rest with the largest aperture and a blackened front sight . With the smallest target aperture I could improve that group on an average of only ? or %2 inch . On game this would not make the slightest difference , as anyone can see . The earliest types of aperture sights were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tang of the rifle and close to the eye . A sight so located is very fast and effective . Aperture sights have also been mounted on the cocking piece of bolt-action rifles . They are also close to the eye and fast . The tang peep can be used on a rifle of the .30/30 ? .25/35 class where recoil is not severe , but it is dangerous to mount a sight on the tang of a rifle of considerable recoil , particularly with a short stock , as on uphill shots the sight is dangerously close to the eye . Some years ago the hunting wife of a famous rifleman took a shot at a goat that was uphill from her , with a short-stocked rifle with a tang peep . The sight drove into her eye , and her eye had to be removed . Most of the newer peep sights are of the receiver type . They are a little too far from the eye to be ideal , but they are safe and effective . Sights of this sort are the famous Lyman 48 series and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this type are the Redfield 102 series and the Lyman 57 series . All of these receiver sights are adjustable for both windage and elevation . The price is moderate , and excellent shooting , both at game and on the target range , can be done with them . The more expensive sights of this type are adjustable in either ? , %2 , or  | one minute of angle . As we shall see in the chapter on sighting in , this is a priceless boon . FRONT SIGHTS Various materials in various forms have been used in the manufacture of front sights . The most widely used is a copper alloy , which the trade calls gold ; another , bone , which is called ivory ; still another favorite material is red plastic . Front sights for hunting are usually in the form of round beads . Sometimes they have a flat face turned toward the shooter . Sometimes they come to a point . Any front sight has a tendency to shoot away from the light because the light forms a false center on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gold bead than with front sights of other materials , but it is present with any front sight . A few days before I wrote this I was shooting a .375 Magnum at two hundred yards . With an unblackened gold bead front sight and an aperture rear sight the group was forming about six inches to the right of the center of the target away from the light . I took a match and blackened the front sight . The next group formed about as far to the left . In shooting big game at moderate ranges this tendency to shoot away from the light would ordinarily not cause a miss . It will , however , cause many misses on small game and lower scores on the target . For all its faults , the gold bead is probably the best front sight . It is more durable and it will take quite a beating before it gets knocked off . It can be blackened with a match or with burning camphor for target use . The ivory or red plastic beads will not stand the flame of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those I have had are always breaking off . Under some lights the red bead shows up poorly , appearing almost black . The flattoppcd steel blade can be used for game shooting in the Far West and in regions of good light , but in dark woods and on overcast  | days it can not be picked up quickly . Once it was customary to cut dovetail slots in the barrels of rifles for both front and rear sights . It has been found that that is not a good practice , as the slots cause the barrels to vibrate excessively and erratically and these slotted barrels give relatively poor accuracy . Now sights are put on the barrels with bands or mounted on integral ramps . The fanciest type of front sight is the ramp base , which is either integral with the barrel , put on with a band , or sweated on . Actually the iron sight is for no purpose as good as the scope sight , but the iron sight is stronger than the scope sight , and iron sights can be used in fog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight out of business .  | Telescopic Sights IT IS not generally realized , but the telescopic sight has been in use in the United States for a great many years . In the American Civil War , Union snipers were armed with telescope-sighted rifles and it is a minor bit of history that a sniper so equipped killed a Confederate general a mile away after elaborate calculations of wind , temperature , barometer , and so on . Telescopesighted rifles were used by those expert shots with their heavy single-shot rifles who exterminated the buffalo on the great plains in the 1870 's and ' 8o 's . It was not until after World War I , however , that the telescopic sight became popular in the United States or even satisfactory for general hunting . Indeed , when the first World War broke out , the American army was without a practical sniper 's scope , and so few ordnance officers knew anything about the function of telescopic sights that the Warner &; Swasey prismatic scope which was adopted was one of the most terrible turkeys ever designed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war of 1914-18 were in the hands of the Germans and were the product of the great German optical industry of which the firms of Zeiss and Hensoldt are leaders . Before the first World War the few scopes that were seen were usually of the target type and most of them were in the hands of Scheutzen target men . Early scopes of this type were the Stevens , the Malcolm , the Winchester A-5 , and the Seidel.  | During the 1920 'S however , the scope began to gain some popularity , largely because of the publicity given scope sights by such men as Townsend Whelen writing in Outdoor Life , Paul Curtis writing in Field &; Stream , E. C. Crossman in various periodicals . The demand for good target scopes led to fine ones being brought out by the Lyman Gun Sight Corporation , Fecker , and Unertl . The first hunting scopes were imported from Germany and mounted with various American mounts , but before long good American scopes were being produced ? the Noske , the Weaver , and others . Within a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tens of thousands of small , inexpensive scopes on .22 'S . A scope is almost a must on the target range , and even shotguns have been equipped with telescopic sights . The Advantages of the Telescopic Sight . There are many advantages that accrue to the user of a scope sight . It is fundamental that no one can shoot any better than he can see and the scope enables the rifleman to see better . Shots that are completely impossible with iron sights become commonplace with a scope . The difference is not so marked as it might seem on the target range . The target shooter uses a dead-black target , a squaretopped dead-black front sight , which gives good definition with a six-o'clock hold against the black bull . He uses a small aperture peep . In game shooting the scope has tremendous advantages because the poorer the light conditions are , the better the scope shows up in comparison with any iron sight . The magnification of the scope , which many consider allimportant , is just one of the scope 's many assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us have . Let us say that the normal error of aim of an individual is two inches at one hundred yards , with iron sights . By that we mean that this particular individual with the particular sights he is using is unable to tell if he is holding one inch to the right or one inch to the left , one inch high or one inch low . Thousands of experiments have proved that this error of aim exists . A rifle is put in a rest  | of some sort . Then the bull's-eye is moved around until the aimer declares it lines up perfectly with the sights . Then a pencil mark is made exactly in the center of the bull . It is surprising how large the triangle made by these three " shots " often is . A two-power scope will cut this error of aim in half ; a four-power scope will cut it to one fourth , and so on . Scopes as high as twenty-power are being used in small-bore matches , the most highly competitive of all target shooting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the error aim to an absolute minimum . As we shall shortly see , however , this business of magnification , for many purposes , can be greatly overdone . Perhaps even more important than magnification is the fact that the telescopic sight puts everything in the same optical plane . With open sights the eye is given an impossible task ? to focus at once on the rear sight , about eighteen inches from the eye , on the front sight , about thirty inches from the eye , and on the game or target , about a hundred yards , let us say , from the eye . The task can be done fairly well by young flexible eyes . It can not be done at all by old or middle-aged , inflexible eyes . The peep sight makes it easier on the inflexible eye , as the user simply looks through the peep at the front sight , which he places against the target on the game . The front sight and the target then are relatively but not absolutely in the same focus . A suitable scope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see like a boy again . Another great advantage of the scope is a by-product of magnification and light-gathering power . With a scope it will become far more apparent that that " buck " is really a doe , or the bear by that rotten log is another sportsman looking for a lost cartridge . The scope enables the man without binoculars to size up a good head far better than he could with the naked eye . With a scope he is much less likely to shoot the wrong animal or to shoot a human being . Furthermore , when he shoots he can place his shots with much greater efficiency . The scope gathers light , and under poor conditions the field of view in the scope is  | much brighter than it is morning or late in the evening , when game is often afoot and when accurate shooting would be impossible with any iron sight . Because scopes have so often been associated with the target range , many believe the scope to be slow . As a matter of fact , a suitable hunting scope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sights . The scope has its disadvantages as well , but , to me at least , they are relatively minor . The scope is necessarily more expensive than iron sights . The scope is also somewhat more fragile , although not nearly so fragile as might be believed . The scope can be put out of commission by rain or fog . This too , however , is something that has been greatly exaggerated . I have hunted with scope-sighted big-game rifles from the deserts of Mexico to the subarctic of the Yukon , during which time I have made hundreds of shots with scope-sighted rifles that I could not possibly have made with any iron sights . Only on a few occasions have I ever had a scope-sighted rifle put out of commission by rough use or by weather . What a Scope Is . The telescope sight is simply one form of what is known as a Galilean or terrestrial telescope , which consists of a metal tube of seamless steel or aluminum tubing and uses a number of lenses . The front lens is known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it back within the tube . The picture , however , is upside down . The next lens , within the tube , is known as the inverter ; it turns the picture right side up once more and passes it on to the lens into which one looks , which is known as the ocular lens . Lenses , of course , vary in size and formula . The best lenses are compound achromatic lenses made of two kinds of glass cemented together and corrected for color and for spherical aberration . The best lenses give fields of view that are clear , sharp , and bright to the edges of the field . Through them colors are seen naturally . Poor lenses will show straight lines as being curved . They will have color fringe and  | at the edges of the field one can see practically every color in the spectrum . Through them colors do not look clear and natural . The telescope sight must be much more strongly constructed than the ordinary telescope because it has to stand the shock of the recoil . The scope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because of the recoil , one obviously can not jam one 's eye right up against the ocular and consequently the scope must form the picture at some distance from the eye ? usually from two to six inches . There must be some provision for moving either the scope itself or the reticule to make it coincide with the bore of the rifle so that the bullet will strike where the reticule rests . When this is done , the rifle is said to be " sighted in. , , Let us now examine some terms used in connection with telescopic sights . One is " field of view . " That simply means how much one can see when looking through the scope . It is usually stated in terms of feet at too yards . If it is said that the field of view is 30 feet at ioo yards it means that the man looking through the scope can see a circle with a diameter of 30 feet . Some hunting scopes like the Weaver K-z.5 and the Lyman Alaskan have fields of view of around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide field of view is exceedingly important for the big-game scope to be used in woods or brushy country , because one should be able to see the game instantly when the rifle is snapped to the shoulder . On the other hand , one can use a very small field of view with a target scope because the target remains stationary and does n't jump over a log and disappear . The field of view of a scope is determined by the power and by the diameter of the ocular lens . A %8 - inch ( 22 mm. ) ocular such as was popular on pre-war scopes like the Zeiss or Hensoldt gave a field of around 30 feet at too yards when the magnification was z % or %Z -X . At 1-X the field is doubled . At 4- to 41/2-X the field is cut in half . There is n't any way to get around it . On the other hand , if the power is cut in half , the field of view is  | doubled . If a scope-maker claims a larger field with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field or about the power . If a 3o-foot field is wanted with a 4-power scope , then the diameter of the ocular lens must be increased . There is n't any way out of it . For instance , the famous Zeiss 4-X Zielvier scope , which for many years was the finest 4-X scope in the world and is still one of the best , has a field of view of something over 30 feet at zoo yards , but the ocular lens has a diameter of approximately 1% inches . As a matter of fact , long experience has proved that a field of view of about 30 feet per ioo yards is enough even for fast shooting in the woods . That field can be obtained with a straight tube scope which can be mounted very low . As a consequence , the enlarged oculars on such scopes as the Lyman Alaskan , the Weaver K-2.5 , and the Norman-Ford Texan are of doubtful value in spite of the fact that all these scopes give fields of around 40 feet . I happen to prefer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field of view . The relative brightness of the scope is determined by several factors . The kind of optical glass used in the lenses , the formula by which they are ground , and whether the lenses are coated or not ? all these points are important . Everything else being equal , however , the brightness is largely dependent upon the size of the objective or front lens . The larger the objective , the more light is let in , just as the larger a window is , the more light it lets in . A - inch objective such as is found in the Noske , the Lyman Alaskan , or the G-88 is entirely satisfactory with a 2 ? -X scope and will produce a good bright glass . When the power is boosted , however , the light is cut down in relation to the increase of power . It is for this reason that a 4-X glass must have a large objective . It is also the reason that target scopes of high power have those large objectives and that binoculars to be used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power is increased without enlarging the objective , the result is a scope with poor definition , or the ability to distinguish detail . Let us suppose that you are hunting without  | binoculars . You see a black lump in the distance and you think it may be a bear . Let us say that your scope has high power but poor definition . Then you will simply see a larger black lump , still without form or detail . On the other hand , if your scope has good definition you will be able to determine detail and see whether this lump is a bear or a log . The best target scopes can spot bullet holes at one hundred yards , and under good conditions a highly corrected 4-X hunting scope can do the same thing . Another term often used is " latitude of eye relief . " Eye relief is said to be " critical " or " non-critical . " Considerable latitude of eye relief is exceedingly important in a hunting scope , and in the best hunting scopes a working , satisfactory field of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to five inches from the eye . With a target-type scope to be used on stationary objects this latitude is not nearly so important , because again the target stays put . But if you try to use a scope with a critical eye relief on running game , you will come to grief . Your eye has to be exactly in the right place or else the whole field will black out and you will lose sight of the game . All of the good modern hunting scopes have considerable latitude , but every scope has a point at which the full field is obtained . With most German scopes this is three inches from the eye . With most American scopes it is obtained at a slightly greater distance . For a scope on a fixed mount , at least three inches is necessary because of the danger of recoil . Every scope should make provision for focusing . Various optical systems do this by various means . One of the commonest is to screw the eyepiece containing the ocular lens in or out and then lock it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in Weaver , Lyman , Redfield , and other big-game scopes . Another system is to screw the objective in or out , which is used by the Lyman and Unertl target scope . Still another method of focus is to move the inverter lens , which is used with the Fecker target scope and some foreign big-game scopes.  | To focus a scope , one should increase the focal length until things look fuzzy and then shorten it by screwing in with the typical eyepiece focusing until the letters on a sign at zoo or 15o yards are sharp , black , and clear . Focus slightly on the long side does not hurt the eye . Focus slightly on the short side will cause eyestrain . The lowest-power scopes have universal focus , which means that anything viewed through such a scope from twenty-five yards to infinity is in workable focus . The high-power target scopes do not have this feature and must be focused every time for the shorter ranges . An 8-X scope , for example , focused at twenty-five yards will give severe eyestrain if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one that causes a good deal of confusion . The term simply means that the reticule is not properly located in the focus of the lens . The result is that if parallax is present a scope can be rested on something with the hands not touching it ; then when the head is moved back and forth and up and down the reticule will move against the target . As can be easily seen , this will result in inaccuracy because unless the eye is in exactly the same position for every shot , the point of aim each time will be different . With the cross-hair reticule a little parallax can usually be detected in one hair or the other as they do not lie exactly in the same optical plane . If they are adjusted as a good compromise , however , the parallax will usually be so slight as to cause absolutely no trouble . As a usual thing , parallax is removed at the factory , but not always . A scope that will show no parallax whatsoever at one hundred yards and up will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friends of mine have practically knocked themselves out because they tested new scopes for parallax by training them on something within the room and then found parallax . Sonic scopes have no provision for the removal of parallax and  | have to be returned to the factory . The Noske scope , however , has this provision , and parallax can be removed by turning the front lens in and out . With the Weaver scopes the screws holding the reticule housing can be loosened and moved until parallax disappears . The Kinds of Scopes . Scopes are designed for various purposes . Although the classifications overlap to some extent , we will divide telescope sights here into big-game scopes , target scopes , varmint scopes , and scopes for the .22 rim-fire cartridges . Choosing the proper kind of scope is very important . An 8 or ro-X target scope , large , bulky , and mounted on relatively fragile mounts , would be almost worse than nothing for hunting whitetail deer in the woods . The field of view is small , the illumination none too good under poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big-game scope would be almost useless on a small-bore target range in competition with scopes of higher power and % - minute precision target mounts . Likewise this same low-power hunting scope will leave much to be desired for use on varmints . Any scope is better than iron sights , but as compared with a scope made especially for varmint hunting , it would come off a poor second best . Much criticism of the scope sight comes from men who have tried to use the wrong scope . Several years ago a friend of mine had a Lyman 5-A target scope put on a .30/06 rifle . He felt he would be all fixed up for deer hunting . He went out , jumped a big buck up within thirty yards . He threw the rifle to his shoulder , and because of the small field of view and critical eye relief he could not even see the deer through the scope . He went back immediately to the use of iron sights and ever since has been a mortal enemy of scope sights in general . I get many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small , neat big-game scopes on varmint rifles . The man who does so simply can not hit small objects at long range because a 2 ? -X  | scope does not have the magnification and definition to enable him to do so . I will discuss the types of scopes in detail in the remainder of this chapter . Big-Game Scopes . The scope sight to be used on a big-game rifle should ideally be small , light , and rugged . It should be mounted as low as possible to give a line of sight not much higher than that of iron sights . It should be mounted with strong mounts because the hunting rifle often has to take some rather rough treatment . It is highly important that the field of view of the hunting scope be relatively large ? at least 30 feet per loo yards of range if it is ever to be used in brush and woods . The scope should have great light-gathering power and the resulting brightness because big game is often shot early in the morning and very late in the afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and often in heavy woods where the light is pretty well blotted out . Because the big-game hunter has to shoot fast the eye relief should be non-critical . Fine micrometer adjustments are not important with a biggame scope because the best practice with a big-game rifle is to sight the rifle in for one particular load and then to leave it . It makes no difference on big game if the rifle is shooting an inch to the right at 200 yards or even an inch to the right at roo yards , but such a rifle would enormously handicap the prairie-dog or woodchuck hunter or the target shot . The first successful big-game scopes used in the United States were the German Zeiss Zielklein 21/2-X and the Hensoldt Zielklein of 2 3/4-X . Both of these were straight-tube scopes with the body of the scope %$ inch in diameter . The portion of the scope containing the ocular lens is slightly larger and is threaded for adjustment of focus . These scopes can be mounted very low . They are bright , optically excellent , and in every way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imported in great numbers from Germany and mounted usually with the Noske , Redfield , or Griffin &; Howe mounts . Both of these scopes have  | adjustments for elevation only , and hence windage must be within the mount itself . In those early days most gunsmiths were reluctant to tackle a real bolt-handle alteration where the bolt handle is cut off and welded back on at a lower angle . As a consequence those scopes had to be mounted high to clear the uplift of the bolt handle . Along in the later 1920 's , R. Noske , of San Carlos , California , who pioneered the first successful side mount for scopes , brought out a 21/2-X scope with a .22-MM. tube ( %8 - inch ) and an enlarged ocular lens ground to give an eye relief so long that the scope could be mounted ahead of the unaltered bolt handles of Winchester Model 54 Springfield and Mauser rifles . This plainly showed how great an advantage it was to mount a scope as low as possible so the shooter 's cheek could be firm against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both windage and elevation were in the tube , and the mount did not need to be complicated by a windage feature . Since that time almost all American scopes have been made with windage . Following the Noske , one of the first successful big-game scopes to come out was the Weaver 330 , which had a 3/4-inch tube and was consequently smaller than the Noske or the German scopes . Optically , however , the 330 was and is excellent . The field of view is over 30 feet at loo yards . Although Weaver advertised z 3/4-X , the power was in reality about 2 . It was Bill Weaver who put scopes on tens of thousands of American rifles because he sold the good little 330 complete with a simple and satisfactory , though homely , " T " side mount , for $27.50 . Prior to that time getting a hunting scope mounted on a rifle cost around $75 . The mounting charge was from $7.50 to $10 , and such mounts as the Neidner and Griffin &; Howe cost $30 . The first attempt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunting scope resulted in a failure known as the Stag . It was too heavy , too bulky , mounted too high . When the Lyman ? Alaskan 2 %2-X came out , however , it was one of the world 's  | fine scopes . Externally it resembles the Noske with a 22-mm. tube and enlarged eyepiece . In fact , any mount made for the Lyman Alaskan can be used with the Noske . The Alaskan was at first made with an aluminum tube , but the tubes were soft . They dented and bent , so it was equipped with a steel tube . John Unertl of target-telescope fame also brought out a 2.1/2-X scope similar to the Alaskan and the Noske , but no great numbers of them were distributed . The Weaver 330 served to introduce many riflemen to the use of the hunting scope sight . It served satisfactorily and honorably in World War II as a sniper 's scope on special 1903 Springfield rifles . When the war was over and Weaver tooled up to get back to peacetime production , he decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ K-2.5 . It was one of the most brilliant scopes ever made anywhere . It has a 1-inch tube with the larger objectives lens and for a scope of only 21/2-X a 1-inch objective is enough to give great brilliance . The optical system is excellent . The field of view of approximately 40 feet at loo yards is tremendous , the reticule adjustment system is superior to that of the old 330 . Some may object to the K-2.5 on the ground that it is unnecessarily bulky with its enlarged ocular and 1-inch tube . It is a fact that it can not be mounted as low and give as low a line of sight as a scope with a smaller straight tube . Nevertheless it is a very fine and effective scope . The early Noske , Zeiss , and Hensoldt 21/2-X scopes all had %$ ( zz mm. ) tubes , and so did the excellent but now obsolete Lyman Alaskan . The Weaver 300 and 440 scopes , also obsolete , had 3/4-inch tubes , and the moderate-priced Weaver J-2.5 and J-4 scopes and the inexpensive Weaver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diameter . Right after the war , Weaver set the fashion by increasing his tube diameter on the K-series scopes to 1 inch . Other manufacturers followed his lead , and today most hunting scopes are so made . The Redfield scopes , which have had a checkered career and which have appeared under the Stith , Kollmorgen , and finally Redfield names ,  | were for years made with 26-mm. tubes , an odd size and one that complicated the problem of mount rings . However , as this is written , in late 1961 , I understand that the plan is to go to 1-inch rings in 1962 . Most Japanese and German scopes made for the American market have 1-inch rings so they can be adapted to American mounts , but a few still use the odd-size 261/2 mm. tube . Because the American market is by far the world 's largest for telescope sights , American manufacturers have been enabled to invest heavily in expensive precision machinery for scope manufacture . American scopes are the best in the world , and the only scopes comparable to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The field is fiercely competitive , and scope prices have not risen much since the war . In about 1946 , Weaver set a price of around $45 for his excellent K-4 scope , and although the K-4 has undergone several modifications and improvements , the price has remained the same . Other dealers have not been able to sell scopes in quantity at prices much higher than those set by Weaver . Many scopes are imported from Japan at cut-rate prices . Some are junk , poor optically , erratic in adjustment , flimsy . Some Japanese scopes are , on the other hand , quite good . British scopes and mounts are expensive and old-fashioned , although , like most British goods , they are sound enough . Actually the London custom-rifle makers generally use German scopes . The scopes turned out in Germany and Austria range all the way from superb to fair . Today all of the good hunting scopes have similar specifications . As we have seen , the use of the 1-inch tube is just about universal on the high-quality hunting scopes . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 to 5 inches from the eye . All have similar fields of view . The good 21/2-X scopes , for example , have fields that run from 40 to 45 feet at loo yards . The 4-X scopes have fields of around 30 and the 6-X scopes of around zo.  | A case can be made for scopes with fixed reticules equipped with mounts adjustable for windage and elevation . However , the American scope buyer has expressed a preference for scopes internally adjustable for windage and elevation . Most American scopes are so adjustable , with graduated dials marked in minutes of angle and protected against dust and moisture with screw-on caps . Since the war , all American quality scopes have been made with coated optics which aid in the transmission of light by cutting down on reflection and which have done away with the old bugaboo of the scope user ? shooting in the direction of the sun . Before the war , the favorite power for the hunting scope was 21/2 . The famous Zeiss and Hensoldt Zielkleins were of that power , and so were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ %2 is still the best bet for woods shooting , where a wide field is more important than definition . I have used scopes of that power extensively and I am convinced that they will do about as well as any for ALL big-game shooting , including shots up to 250 to 300 yards on mountain game . After all , a deer , a caribou , a goat , an elk , or a moose is a large animal , and one does not need high power for shot placement except at the most extreme ranges . The 2 %2-X scope also has the advantage of eye relief less critical than that of the scope of higher power . An interesting scope that has never been very popular is the i-X made by Weaver and called the K-I . It has no power whatsoever and the field merges with the outside air . It is very fast and has been used on rifles for brush shooting and on repeating shotguns used with slugs for deer hunting . It is also used on single-barrel shotguns ( pumps and autoloaders ) for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shotgun can be " sighted in " to place the center of the pattern wherever the shotgunner wants it . For years I argued with Bill Weaver that the most useful allaround power for the scope to be used purely for big-game hunting and in the open as well as in the woods would be a full 3-X.  | He finally brought out the K-3 , and it has sold so well that Leopold and Lyman both make 3-X scopes in competition . The 3 X gives a little less field than the 2 %Z , more than the 4-X , a bit less definition than the 4-X , but more field . It is an excellent compromise . I have a pair of .375 Magnum rifles fitted with 3-X scopes . Since the war , the best selling scope has been the 4-X . This is the best power for plains and mountain big-game hunting . It is also best for varmints generally shot on the run , such as jack rib  - -  bits and coyotes . It is usable even on small varmints like woodchucks up to about 150 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal for brush shooting , but for this it will do . For the mountain rifle , the 4-X is the thing , and on a large animal a good scope of this power gives definition sufficient for good holding to 400 and 500 yards . A 6-X scope is a compromise . It is a bit lacking in field for running shots at big game , particularly in the woods , and is lacking in power for long shots at small varmints . However , a 6-X will get out about all there is in such cartridges as the .22 Horner , the .218 Bee , and the .222 Remington . Telescope sights of the hunting type and of 8 and ao-X , such as the Weaver K-8 and K-io and the Lyman All-American scopes of that power , are strictly varmint scopes . There has been a considerable shift to hunting-type , internally adjustable scopes of such power from the externally adjustable target-type scopes . An increasingly hot item on the American scope market is the variable-power scope . The idea is not new , as the German optical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1930 's . The first American variable power was the now obsolete Weaver K V , which could be shifted in power from about 3 to 5-X . I understand that the K V did n't go over too well , as scope buyers were not content with a choice of two powers : they wanted many powers . In my position as a practicing gun-editor , I get thousands of letters a year from readers seeking advice on the purchase of  | rifles , scopes , and various equipment . A high proportion say they want a variable-power scope on a hinged mount so that the scope can be swung out of the way for the use of iron sights . This , of course , is beginner stuff . To the innocent hunter this sounds like more for the money . Our bright-eyed boy imagines himself looking at his game judiciously , then deciding whether he is to use scope or iron sights , then , if he is to use a scope , selecting the right power and letting the game have it . The whole idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase , the boys reason , they are fixed up with a scope for the woods , for the mountains , for varmints . However , there are some serious holes in the proposition . Variable-power scopes are more complicated than scopes of fixed power . They are at their optical best at only one power . Most serious criticism of all is that with most of them the reticule becomes apparently larger with higher power , smaller with lower power . If a scope is variable in power from 3 to 9-X for example , the cross wires are usually about right at 4 or 5-X , far too coarse at 9-X , far too fine at 3-X . Most lads who buy variable-power scopes set them about mid-range and leave them that way . However , Bausch &; Lomb has whipped the problem after a fashion by the use of a tapered " cross-wire " reticule which is etched on glass . In his new variable , Weaver uses a trick reticule , which consists of one fine and two coarse cross-wires . At high power , aim is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low power , the whole combination is used . Weatherby imports excellent variable-power scopes made in Germany to his specifications . Bausch &; Lomb makes two ? one of the hunting type and one of target type . Both must be used on adjustable mounts . Bushnell and Stoeger import variablepower scopes from abroad , Stoeger brings in variables from Europe , Weaver and Leupold make variables which have sold well . Redfield came on the market in 1962 with a variable power with the reticule in the eyepiece . It remains the same apparent size at all powers ? a real breakthrough in variable powers .  | The Target Scopes . As we have seen , magnification is far more important than field in the target scope . High magnification cuts down the error of aim , and in competitive shooting every possible means to close up a group must be used if the shooter is to be in the money . Since the target stays put , it can be kept in a relatively small field . The field of view of the 8-power Lyman Target Spot is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 10-power Target Spot is only 12 feet . Target-type scopes slide in the mount . As a rifle recoils , the scope tends to stay still and it must be pulled back for each shot in a rifle of heavy recoil . Because of this the eye relief can be much shorter than in the big-game scope and also much more critical . The eye relief of the Target Spot is only t % inches . With a big-game scope on a rigid mount this short eye relief would be dangerous and on uphill shots the shooter would eventually get smacked in the eye . In the Unertl target scopes power up to I4-X can be obtained ? and in that case the field at too yards is only 6 feet . For practical purposes the Lyman , Unertl , and Fecker target scopes all give just about the same results . All are quite long , from 20 to 24 inches in length . All are optically good . Choosing between them is a matter of personal preference . None of these target scopes has either windage or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the barrel or on the barrel and receiver ring . The mountings are in two pieces . They fit on the blocks with female dovetails and are clamped by thumbscrews . When the screws are loosened they can be quickly removed and replaced without any change in point of impact . The rear portion of the mount is adjustable for windage and elevation and marked with %2- or 1-minute clicks . There should be exactly 7.2 inches between the front and rear mounts . These fine adjustments are necessary for target shooting . A man has to stay in the to ring , which at 50 feet on the official small-bore target measures only .15 inch , .335 inch at 25 yards , and 2 inches at too yards . At the greater distance many a match  | is settled by the number of X 's ? and the X ring measures only i inch . These target scopes of around 8- and io-X are often used for varmint shooting by those hunters who specialize in long-range work with high-velocity rifles of small bore . They are practical , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crows , etc. , because of the small field of view . Further , the focus is not universal , and ideally they should be refocused every time the range is changed . Varmint Scopes . The successful varmint hunter has to do much finer shooting than the big-game hunter . A crow is a very small mark , measuring only about 2 %Z by 5 inches . A full-grown woodchuck or a rock chuck will measure only about 9 by 14 inches . The antelope jackrabbit of the Southwest , one of the largest of the American jackrabbits , will measure about 5 by 1o . The average prairie dog does n't measure more than about 2 by 5 . These marks are small , hard to see , and hard to hit . Although a big-game scope is certainly better than iron sights for this work , it is by no means ideal . More power , enabling the hunter to see better , is indicated . About 4-X is the minimum for the successful varmint scope . I am inclined to believe that 6-X is better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is cut down further and consequently I would not advise a scope of the higher power for use on varmints only . The varmint scope should also be susceptible to fine adjustments . A rifle that averages shooting off an inch or two or even a little more at i oo yards certainly does not cause anyone to miss big game , but a rifle shooting off that much will cause a man to miss a prairie dog every time . Because varmints are often in high grass and weeds or against hillsides not very different in color from the animals themselves , a scope with relatively good gathering power and fine definition is needed . This takes in a lot of territory . One gains magnification at the sacrifice of field and illumination ? and field at the sacrifice of  | magnification . Consequently any varmint scope must to some extent be a compromise . For the hunting of prairie dogs , woodchucks , crows , and hawks , about as good a scope as one can get is one like the 6-X Lyman Junior Target Spot . With its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very exactly . It is pretty well in focus from 50 yards to infinity and the 6-X has a field of view of about 16 feet at ioo yards . With a fine cross-hair reticule I have found that from a good steady prone position one can kill crows and prairie dogs regularly to about 15o yards . The Junior Target Spot is not quite so heavy as the Target Spots , with their larger objective . It is a very neat and satisfactory scope . Another good little scope for varmints is the Fecker 4-X small-game scope with precision mounts and the Fecker 3/4-inch target scope in either 4.5-X or 6-X . A good deal of Western varmint shooting is entirely different from the conventional woodchuck and crow shooting familiar to Eastern hunters . One of the most interesting of all Western varmints is the jackrabbit . He seldom stays put long , and although he is often shot sitting , he is usually about to jump up and dash away . He makes a relatively large mark and one that duplicates on a small scale any type of big-game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the canyon as he squats half asleep in the shadow of a bush or he can be shot as he bounds through the grass at short range . The Western coyote is also an animal that often has to be shot on the run . This tendency of Western varmints to pick up and leave the country in a hurry makes an entirely different type of scope necessary ? one with universal focus and a wide field of view . Many Western varmint hunters simply use their regular big-game rifles with 21/2-X hunting scopes . Because of the low magnification they are not very satisfactory . They are fine for shooting running jackrabbits or running coyotes to i o0 or even to 150 yards , but beyond that distance one simply can not see well enough with them .  | It is typical of Western varmint shooters that they start with the 2 %2-X scopes . They usually wind up by getting scopes of about 4-X with fields of view of around 30 feet at about ioo yards of range . Scopes like the Zeiss Zielvier and the new Weaver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If someone pinned me down , I would prefer the K-4 to the Zeiss because with the internal adjustments for % - minute clicks of both windage and elevation it is far easier to sight in exactly . The varmint hunter is usually also a handloader who likes to fool around with various combinations of powder , primer , and so on . He needs a scope that will enable him to adjust for the different points of impact these loads will give . Small-Game Scopes . The varmint hunter shoots animals that are not edible . He uses bullets traveling at high velocity that tear the animal up badly , disintegrate when they strike the ground , and do not ricochet . The small-game hunter , on the other hand , uses the .22 rim-fire cartridge since he wants to save the game for the table . The small-game hunter does his shooting within 1 oo yards . He has to hit very small marks which are often in deep shade and partially concealed by grass , leaves , and twigs . He needs a scope with a reasonably wide field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the other hand , he does not need long eye relief because there is no danger of the tube being driven back into his eye by recoil . The conventional big-game scope of about 2 %2-X does quite well for this shooting although the magnification could be greater . One of the greatest disadvantages to using the big-game scope on a .22 is the expense . All of them are built very strong and the strength increases the expense of construction . As this is written , Weaver has just brought out his S2-5 , an excellent little scope optically , which will sell for $22.50 . It is not a bad scope for a big-game rifle and is ideal for a .22 small-game rifle . At least two other manufacturers have scheduled for production good 3- and 4-power scopes that will cost , complete with mount , about $30 , which will be good optically and should  | answer this real need . The old Weaver 29-S was a good inexpensive little scope of this class . From what I can hear , the new scopes will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been put on .22 rifles on the theory that practically anything would do for a .22 . Some of them were optically very sad . The mounts were fragile and any blow would change the point of impact . On some of them the eye relief was so critical that a movement of the head a quarter of an inch one way or the other would blot the field out . Although those scopes made many people interested in better ones , they also served to prejudice many against scopes of all kinds . Small-game shooting with a .22 is precision work and deserves a good scope . The head of a squirrel at forty yards is a small mark and can not be struck regularly unless the scope can be adjusted exactly and unless the optics are good enough so that the head can be seen clearly and precision aim taken . Reticules for the Scope Sight . The mind of man has run riot when it comes to thinking up reticules for the scope . The Germans particularly have brought out some very fantastic jobs ? combinations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as simple as possible so as not to clutter up the field of view with miscellaneous hardware . It should concentrate the attention at the point of aim . It should be easily seen under the conditions in which it is used and one should be able to take exact aim with it . The three best types of reticule are the cross-hair or crosswire , the post , and the dot . Cross-hairs are usually defined as fine , medium fine , medium , and coarse . If the hairs are of the proper thickness the cross-hair is a very fine reticule that can be used for practically any kind of hunting or shooting . A very fine hair can be used for small-bore shooting ? one that should enable the shooter to quarter the io ring . For varmint shooting , the hair should be wider and for big-game shooting still wider . For all-around big-game hunting the hairs should subtend about r inch per ioo yards of range . One can sec , however , that such a  | hair would n't be much good for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about cover the crow . Let us say , then , that for small-bore target shooting the fine hair should be chosen , for most varmint shooting the medium-fine hair , and for biggame shooting the medium hair . The coarse cross-hair blots out too much game even for long-range big-game shooting and should never be chosen . The medium cross-hair used in such a scope as the Weaver K-4 can be seen even in very poor light with a bright scope , and nothing is to be gained by getting a coarser hair , whereas a good deal is to be lost . Particularly those who do n't know much about it believe that the cross-hair is only for target shooting . Actually the crosshair is one of the very best of all reticules . It is a particularly helpful reticule to use for running shooting and big game on the plains or across canyons , as the horizontal cross-hair can be dragged along the body of the game animal and correct elevation can be maintained . Then when the vertical cross-hair is a proper distance ahead , the rifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the post for the shooting of running game because of this . I have used cross-hair reticules under all conditions for big-game shooting and have found them satisfactory if the hair or wire is of proper width . I have even killed animals silhouetted against the skyline when it was so dark that I could not see the intersection of the cross-hairs . Because of the proportion of the cross , however , it was easy to tell where the intersection was , even though it could not be seen . Another most excellent reticule is the dot . As made by Captain T. K. Lee of Birmingham , Alabama , the dot is suspended on cross-hairs made of spider web , so thin that it is difficult to see them , and the dot appears to float . For small-bore shooting on rifles with scopes of considerable power , the dot can be made as small as 3/4 inch so it can be centered within the X ring . For a 4-X varmint or big-game scope , a dot subtending about 2 %2 or 3 minutes of angle is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dot reticule is to order it too small . Sonic have  | even ordered 1-minute dots for z %Z-power big-game scopes and then have been disappointed when they could not see them . For the conventional big-game scope a dot subtending 4 minutes of angle is just about right . My experience has shown me that a dot of this size can be seen practically anywhere and under any conditions , whereas a smaller dot can not . Either the dot or the cross-hair can be held over the long shots without blotting out the game . The dot has the added advantage of being usable to judge distance by comparing it with the depth of the animal 's body from the top of his shoulder to the bottom of his chest . An antelope , let us say , measures from 14 to 16 inches through the body . Suppose that the dot almost but not quite covers the antelope . You know then that the antelope is about 300 yards away . A bighorn ram or large mule deer is 22 to 24 inches through the body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ width of such an animal 's body ; we then know that the animal is right around 300 yards away . If it covered the whole body it would be evident that the animal was between 500 and boo yards away . On several occasions the use of the dot has enabled me to tell the range rather exactly and to make a hit where without it I should have missed . The post either with or without a vertical cross-hair is an exceedingly popular reticule . The Germans have made sharppointed picket posts , but these are not to be recommended , because the sharp point tends to fade out in poor light and a group fired with such a reticule will tend to string up and down . For woods hunting at fast jumping whitetail deer in poor light a most excellent reticule is the flat-topped post with a top subtending about 6 minutes of angle . Such a reticule is the one to use if light conditions are going to be very poor . It can be seen as long as anything can be seen through the scope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for long-range shooting because it blots out too much game and makes hold-over difficult . A better compromise is a tapered flat-top post with a fiat portion subtend-  | ing about 3 minutes of angle . The horizontal cross-hair often used in connection with a post has only one useful function : to tell the rifleman if he is canting his rifle or not . Actually the cross-hair is seldom noticed when hunting . My old Springfield , which I have carried all over North America , is equipped with a Zeiss 2 %2-X Zielklein scope with a post and horizontal crosshair . Actually I ca n't remember ever seeing the cross-hair at all when I was hunting big game .  | Mounting the Scope THE first mounts for hunting scopes were all designed with the notion that the scope should be an auxiliary sight . Not only were the mounts built so they could be put on and taken off in a few seconds , but they were also built so that iron sights could be used while the scope was on the rifle . Back thirty and forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What disturbed them , I am convinced , was the fact that scopes had glass in them . They pictured all the lenses in a scope flying into bits at the slightest bump . Nothing sounds more sensible than having a scope so mounted that the hunter can switch to iron sights . I thought so when I bought my first scope-sighted hunting rifle . It was a beautiful little 7-mm . Mauser . It had a Lyman 1-A peep on the cocking piece and a ramp front sight . The scope was a big 4-X German Gerard . The mount was the usual German quick-detachable deal utilizing bases screwed to receiver bridge and ring . It was tunneled so that iron sights could be used under the scope . It was , sad to say , a lousy mount . The hooked leg by which the detachable portion of the mount was affixed to the base on the receiver ring was not hardened . The scope was heavy and way up in the air . The result was that the soft metal of the hooked leg got battered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with the rifle was an 8-inch group at ioo yards . With iron sights the rifle was satisfactorily accurate . Even if the mount  | had been strong enough , it would have been difficult to shoot the rifle accurately because the scope was mounted so high that I had no contact with my cheek against the comb and could not hold the rifle steady . In due course I mustered up enough courage to try to depend on a glass sight alone . I had Bill Sukalle of Phoenix , Arizona , put a Noske 2 1Z-X scope on a Noske side mount on a .270 as low as possible and with the eyepiece on the scope ahead of the bolt lift . I have carried that rifle on foot and on horseback from Sonora to the Yukon , in rain , sleet , and snow , at 125 ? above on an August sheep hunt in Sonora and 1o ? below in the Yukon , at sea level and at 12,000 feet above . The outfit has never failed me and I have never needed auxiliary sights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the receiver ? either the bridge type with the one-piece base of the famous Redfield Junior or the similar Buehler or the two-piece mounts like the Tilden , the two-piece Redfield , or the Buehler . Williams , Lyman , Weaver , Leupold-Stevens , and other outfits make top mounts . The many advantages of these top mounts made them popular . In the first place , they are cheap and easy to mount , as most factory rifles are now drilled and tapped for them . They have dummy screws in the receiver , and all the rifle owner has to do is to remove the dummy screws , then select the right base or bases , and screw them to the receiver . Because of the ease of mounting , I 'd make a guess that at least 90 per cent of all scope mounts in use in this country are of the top-mount type and utilize the holes drilled in the receiver . There are various types of top mounts . Some have no provision at all for any adjustment or have adjustment only for windage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bases are the Redfield , Tilden , and Buehler . Some top mounts have adjustments for both windage and elevation and are designed to be used with scopes that arc not internally adjustable . One such mount is the familiar and relatively fragile one used  | with target scopes . Among fully adjustable mounts are the Bausch &; Lomb , the Leupold Adjusto , the Buehler Micro Dial . There are others . Generally speaking , the American shooting public has expressed preference for internally adjustable scopes and solid , simple mounts affixed to the top of the receiver . Those who manufacture and sell mounts with double adjustments emphasize the fact that such mounts make possible simpler and stronger scopes with no moving parts inside . To me the choice has always seemed to be between a simple mount and a fairly complicated scope or a simple scope and a complicated mount . Take your pick . For a good many years now I have had no trouble at all with scopes . I can not say that , however , about mounts . Most of them are still too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screws that can work loose . When a hunting rifle is used on a trip where there is constant jiggling ? in a hunting car on an African safari or a pack trip in the Rockies ? the hunter should constantly check his mount screws for any looseness . Otherwise he is in for some rude surprises . No hunter should go on a long trip without a screwdriver that fits the screws in his scope mount , and he should go over the mount and check the screws every two or three days . If Allen screws are used in the mount , he should by all means have the proper wrenches in his kit . Unfortunately , as I once found out , Allen wrenches are hard to come by in the middle of the African veldt . But I am no engineer and have no plans to design a mount . Maybe it is just as well . Some of the doggonedest mounts I have ever seen have been those dreamed up by mechanical engineers who were not rifle nuts , who tackled the problem cold , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witless savages . The ideal mount would be almost as strong as the receiver itself , and the fewer parts and screws it has the better . Like the variable power scope , the mount one can quickly take off or move out of the way sounds like more for the money .  | There are two ways the quick switch can be accomplished . One is by the use of the side-bracket mount . The other is by the use of the swing-type mount which allows the scope to be swung aside so iron sights can be used . Right now this is a very hot item and a very high proportion of my correspondents contemplating the purchase of their first scopes and mounts want variable-power scopes on swing mounts . The swing mount was introduced by Frank Pachmayr of Los Angeles before the last war . Now mounts by which the scope can be swung out of the way on hinges are also made by Weaver and by Redfield . Many have used them with perfect satisfaction . One disadvantage of most swing mounts is that they are top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal line of iron sights . Special high iron sights must be used to clear the base portions . Receiver sights , the best of all iron sights , can not be used because the bases interfere with their mounting . Pachmayr furnishes his Lo-Swing mount in both top-mounted and side-mounted versions , and normal iron sights can be used with the side mount . Theoretically at least , these hinged mounts are not as strong as other types . Practically , they seem to get by . My favorite type of mount if both iron and scope sights are to be available is the side-bracket type . With it the base is screwed and pinned and simply screwed to the side of the receiver . This is the fixed portion of the mount . The scope is on a removable side bracket , generally fitted to the base with a dovetail and held tight to it by various means . Side mounts are not nearly as popular as top mounts . They are not so easy to mount . Holes have to be drilled and tapped in the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the holes up exactly right . Generally the gunsmith or dealer by whom a top mount is furnished will mount it free or for $2 or so . A scope mount can be attached and the scope bore-sighted in a half hour or less . Not so the side mount . To mount one properly  | takes about a half day 's work by a good gunsmith and a mounting charge of $10 to $2o is generally made . Not only is mounting expensive , but unless the stock wood alongside the receiver is left thick , the effect is not too handsome . However , if plenty of wood is left on the stock and only the top of the base shows , the appearance of the base left on the rifle is not bad . Good features of the side-bracket mount are that when the scope and the detachable portion are removed , the top of the receiver is left clear for iron sights of normal height . Likewise , because the receiver ring and bridge are uncluttered , a receiver sight can be used . Side mounts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are made by Jaeger , Weaver , and Williams . Top mounts can not be used on rifles with split receiver bridges . Then the side mount is the answer . Offset side mounts are also a necessity on top-ejecting rifles like the Winchester Model 94 ? The side mount with which I have had the most experience is the Griffin &; Howe . To me it is an excellent bet for a rifle that is to be used on dangerous game in heavy brush where the hunter might have to stop a charge at a few yards and wants to use iron sights . It is also excellent if the rifle is apt to be used in rain and wet brush , as is generally the case when the hunter is after the giant Alaska brown bear . The G &; H mount is an extremely reliable one . The base is both pinned and screwed to the receiver , and the scope can be taken off and put back on innumerable times without changing the point of impact . The base of a Lyman No. 48 receiver sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slide can be slipped in , and the hunter is all set . Another advantage of the side mount is that the scope can be taken off for shipment . When I sent a .375 and a .30/06 to Africa in 1959 , I took the scopes off and carried them in my luggage and shipped the rifles to Nairobi by air freight . When I hooked scopes and rifles up again , they were both right on the button .  | The hunter who takes only one rifle on a long trip away from gunsmiths is n't too dumb if he has iron sights to fall back on in case something should happen to the scope . It does n't happen often , but the scope could fog up , get stepped on by a horse , be badly bumped . I would n't pick a side mount for a rifle that is to be carried a great deal in a saddle scabbard . Most leave considerable overhang , and the front part of the scope can wedge into a too-tight scabbard and bend the aluminum-alloy arms of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had happened to my side-mounted .30/06 . For rough use in a saddle scabbard , the all-steel Tilden top mount is a dandy and one that has never given me the slightest trouble . If there are no complications , a handy man with a screwdriver can easily install a top mount on a rifle tapped and drilled for it . However , sometimes there are complications . The receiver may be higher or lower than it is supposed to be . The screw holes may be put in cockeyed . The barrel of the rifle may be out of alignment with the receiver . In some cases , or so I have been told , the objective lens of the scope may be out of line and then the scope looks off toward the Finnegan place . Any of these things call for a shimming job to line up scope and bore , and a gunsmith has the skill and tools to do it . However , if all goes well , the installation of a top-mounted scope on a rifle drilled and tapped for it is a breeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dummy screws , then dip the screws holding the base to the receiver in shellac or even in linseed oil . They should then be turned up tight with a screwdriver that fits the slots . Next , one should take a hammer , tap the butt of the screwdriver lightly , and tighten the screws once more . The screws are now tight and should stay put . The scope should then be put into the rings and placed on the base portion of the mount . The eyepiece of the scope should be positioned far enough ahead so that recoil wo n't drive it back into the eyebrow in any shooting position . Some foreign scopes  | have only 2 1/ to 3 inches of eye relief , and this short critical eye relief has resulted in injury to many people . Most American big-game scopes of from 212 to 4-X have longer and less critical eye relief , and an adequate field of view is obtained at from 4 to 6 inches from the eye . Scopes of power higher than 4 generally have less eye relief than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifles of heavy recoil . Distance of ocular lens from the eye can be arrived at by sliding the scope back and forth in the rings . When the distance from the eye is decided on and the crosswires are on an even keel , the rings can be tightened . As we have said , the screws holding the base of the mount to the receiver should be dipped in shellac . Dipping the other screws in linseed oil slows up their tendency to get loose and back out . On mounts using opposing windage screws such as the Redfield Junior and the Buehler , I dip the left-hand windage screw in linseed and leave the right screw clean . Then I check for looseness , when I am on a trip , by tightening up the right-hand screw with a coin . It is n't too difficult to twist the head off a Redfield Junior windage screw with a large screwdriver , so , for safety 's sake , a coin should always be used for tightening . The last step is to focus the newly mounted scope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 150 yards away . I back the eyepiece out ( counter-clockwise ) until the letters are fuzzy , then turn in ( clockwise ) until the letters are instantly sharp . Focus on the slightly long side gives no eyestrain , but focus on the short side does . The crosswires should be instantly sharp . If they look fuzzy or you see two of them , the focus is not correct . The scope can then be lined up by bore-sighting . One way to do this is to put the rifle with the bolt removed in a vice , in a cardboard box with V 's cut in it , or on sandbags so it can be held steady . Then the scope should be adjusted so that at 50 yards or so the intersection of the crosswires , top of post , or whatever aiming device is used , rests on the center of the bull while the bull is seen in the exact center of the bore .  | Bore-sighting is no substitute for sighting in . It simply assures that the first shot will be somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no substitute for shooting . Very often I do not bore-sight at all when I put a scope on a rifle . Instead I simply take the rifle out , put up a i oo-yard smallbore target at 25 yards , then sit down , and shoot . At that distance a scope would have to be cockeyed indeed not to put the first shot on the target somewhere . I then adjust the scope to put the bullet in the center of the bull . With a scope-sighted biggame rifle so adjusted , the bullet is generally approximately I inch high at 50 yards , 3 inches high at Ioo yards , on aim at anywhere between 175 and 275 yards , depending on the velocity . However , the scope-sighted rifle should be checked by shooting at Ioo yards , and the sighting refined so that the center of the group is 3 inches high . Any error made at 25 yards is multiplied by 4 at loo yards , by 8 at 200 , and by 12 at 300 . Today 's riflemen are lucky to have available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong , easy to put on . Generally all the sight a rifleman will need under hunting conditions is a modern , rugged , waterproof scope on one of the light strong mounts now available . Conditions might arise when the hunter would want to be able to switch to iron sights , but chances are overwhelmingly against it . THE FUTURE OF SCOPE MOUNTING There are still undoubtedly more hunting rifles in the United States that are equipped with iron sights than rifles equipped with scopes . The old Winchester Model 94 has sold about 2,500 , - 000 , and probably 2,000,000 of these are still in relatively usable condition . By that I mean that if a cartridge is put in the chamber and the rifle is fired , it will make a noise and the shooter will retail his head . Most such rifles are still equipped with iron sights ? probably the original sights put on at the factory . Many of these  | have never been sighted in , unless one calls shooting at a white rock at some undetermined range sighting in . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear scopes . To this add the vast number of old military rifles that have found their way into the hands of casual deer hunters ? old .30/40 Krags , pre-1917 Springfields , old Model 93 and 95 Mausers , 6.5 Mannlicher Carcanos , primitive Model 91 Argentine and Belgian 7.65 Mausers , Swiss Schmidt-Rubin . Most of these weird rifles are not scope-mounted , and indeed putting scopes on these old rifles would be like endowing a 10-dollar horse with a zoo-dollar saddle . But the majority of good , new American sporting rifles are quickly scope-mounted . Probably 90 per cent of the Winchester Model 70 , Savage Model IIo , and Remington Model 700 rifles have scopes mounted within a year after they are purchased . The man who buys a really expensive rifle like a Weatherby , a Browning , or a custom job by Griffin &; Howe , Biesen , or Brownell usually orders the scope and mount at the same time that he orders the rifle . Consequently , since most of the expensive rifles ? not only the bolt-action jobs I have mentioned but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly scope-mounted , the next logical step is to incorporate at least part of the scope mount into the receiver . Some of the Finnish Sako rifles and some of the Czech Mausers already have integral dovetails milled into receiver ring and receiver bridge . These are in effect the fixed portion of the scope mount , and the detachable portion , along with the scope , is quickly put on . Something like this should be done with quality American-made sporters.  | Selecting the Rifle MANY different factors are to be considered in buying a rifle , either new or second-hand . The use to which the rifle is to be put , who is to use it , and the cost and availability of ammunition are highly important . No matter how finely finished a particular rifle is , it is a poor buy if the ammunition for it is obsolete or may become obsolete before the life of the rifle is over . A rifle is a poor buy if it is too heavy for the person who is to use it or if the recoil and muzzle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels comfortable in shooting it . Any rifle is a poor buy if replacement parts are unobtainable . A rifle is no bargain , either , if it is chambered for a cartridge unsuited for its purpose . More .22 rifles of one kind or another are sold than all other rifles put together . Most people learn to shoot with a .2 2 , and the .22 is usually the first purchase . There are many different types of .22 's , from light little single-shots through bolt actions , pumps , and automatics to the heavy super-accurate heavy-barreled target rifles that are used in highly competitive small-bore shooting . Probably the best buy for a young boy to learn on is one of the many little bolt-action single-shot rifles . The boy with the single-shot is taught by necessity to conserve his shots . He does n't have more cartridges in reserve if he misses with his first . He always knows when it is loaded and when it is n't . Usually , but not always , these .22 single-shots are somewhat lighter and smaller than the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young boy nearly always gives his first rifle a pretty  | bad beating , and in two or three years of use it has a pretty beaten-up appearance . Of the repeaters I would consider a boltaction clip-loading rifle to be the next best bet and the .22 semiautomatic by far the poorest for the boy . The common variety of .22 is a sort of family affair that everyone shoots . It is used by the young son of the family for small-game hunting , by others for informal target shooting or " plinking " ? breaking bottles , rolling tin cans , perhaps for some aerial shooting . Hair-splitting accuracy is not needed for such a rifle . Any of the pump-action .22 'S do nicely for this , and if the people who use it are careful , a semiautomatic will do . The bolt-action .22 is also suitable and somewhat more foolproof , but it does not give the speed of fire of the automatic or the pump . A great many people get an enormous amount of pleasure out of hunting small game with the .22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prairie dogs . In the north woods a good .22 has kept many a trapper and big-game hunter in grouse . For laying down a barrage on a scampering cottontail the .22 semiautomatic has no equal . Actually for most small-game hunting these little semiautomatics are almost perfect instruments . They are made by various concerns in various weights and styles of stocks . Savage , Remington , Winchester , Mossberg , and Marlin all turn them out . They are seen at their best in the Winchester Model 63 and the Remington Model 241 , which of course are a great deal more expensive . Fitted with a good aperture sight , or even better a good scope of about 2 %2-X , these little semiautomatics are beautiful all-around .22 's and deadly on running small game . For the very finest accuracy the better bolt-action .22 rifles are in a class by themselves . The best accuracy is needed when the .22 rim-fire is used on varmints or on squirrels . The man who wants to take a prairie dog at one hundred yards or hit a squirrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing over a limb had better get one of the more precisely and carefully built boltaction .22'S.  | Standouts are , for boys , the rather light Winchester Model 250 lever , and for adults the Remington 513-T . Both are nicely constructed rifles with exceedingly accurate barrels . They are just about as accurate light .22 rifles as one can get . The de-luxe .22 sporter of them all was the famous Winchester Model 52 in the sporting form . It had the famous Model 52 Winchester target action , a beautifully designed and finished stock , and a handsomely tapered barrel . The rub was that the Model 52 sporter cost important money ? more than most people would care to put into a .22 rifle of any sort . It is no longer made . Roy Weatherby will soon announce a .22 sporter for his line , however . Some men simply like to shoot a . zz to give themselves practice in the off season so they will be more efficient when the biggame season rolls around . Such men should always choose a .22 with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who uses a pump shotgun and a Remington pump-action biggame rifle would be foolish to buy any other type of . zz than a pump . Likewise the man who likes the lever action and wants some preseason practice should get himself a Marlin Model 39-A , which at the present time is the only lever-action . zz rifle on the market . The man who hunts with a bolt action will find plenty of .22 bolt-action rifles to choose from , and some of the heavier models do not weigh such a great deal less than the light boltaction big-game rifle . Many factors go into the selection of the rifle for big-game hunting . It is unwise to be undergunned , and also unwise to be greatly overgunned . The man who is going to hunt nothing larger than deer or the ordinary small black bear of the Eastern woods is foolish to equip himself with a .300 Magnum , for example . Likewise the man who has to hunt in open canyon country where many shots will be taken at long range would be handicapped greatly by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get much exercise is foolish to plan to lug around a ten-pound rifle . In the chapters on the deer rifle and on the various cartridges I have gone rather thoroughly into this busi-  | ness of selection . Let it be said here , however , that no rifle is much good if it is tiring and burdensome to carry or if ammunition is not readily available . For ordinary deer hunting the rifle should be as light as possible and yet chambered for a cartridge of adequate power . In the Eastern woods shots tend to be quick and at close range . There is no need for hairsplitting accuracy . For that reason lightness and handiness are two factors that the purchaser of the deer rifle should consider . Too much writing about rifles is done by men who do a lot of shooting on the target range but spend too little time in the woods . The average deer hunter is not an expert rifleman nor a very good shot . He needs a rifle easy to operate fast and one that is easy to carry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage of hairsplitting accuracy . The lever-action or the pump is the best bet for the casual deer hunter . The lighter such a rifle is , all things considered , the better . With their excellent stocks and relatively light weight such lever-actions as the Winchester Model 88 and the 99 Savage are hard to beat . The Remington 742 pump is a fine rifle , particularly for the man who is used to the pump-action shotgun . The lightweight Savage Model 99-F is most excellent because of the ratio of power to weight . With its short barrel , short stock , and good dimensions it is a wise choice particularly for the young boy or the woman who would find a heavier rifle burdensome . In many instances a rifleman will want to use the same weapon on deer and on varmints . In that case his choice will be altogether different from that for hunting deer alone . Then he will want high velocity , flat trajectory , and great accuracy . He will usually have to put up with more weight . If he is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case fine all-around cartridges are the .243 and the .244 , although a handloader can use the .270 very nicely as an all-around deer and varmint caliber . In the Western states antelope and elk are often on the open list as well as mule , whitetail , and blacktail deer . Elk require a more powerful cartridge than does any deer , and more often  | than not the antelope must be taken at long range . For such hunting the man with the ordinary deer rifle , which does perfectly for the Eastern woods , is very greatly handicapped . He can do fairly well for such hunting with the .308 W.C.F. cartridge in the Model qq Savage , the Model 88 Winchester or Model 742 Remington semiautomatic , and also with the Remington Model 76o pump X. For the most part , however , he is better off with a bolt action than with anything else . As we have seen , the bolt action will hold higher pressures and more powerful cartridges than any other type of action . For the long ranges in the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elk and moose , cartridges of considerable power like the .264 , .30/06 , or .2 70 are necessary . THE CUSTOM-MADE RIFLE As this is written , many thousands of rifles are being produced by various firms and individuals who specialize in rebarreling military actions and fitting them with stocks and sights . These firms call themselves custom rifle-makers . The best rifles they turn out are highly accurate jobs that are things of beauty . The poorer rifles , many of which are sold for high prices , are in every way inferior to factory-made bolt actions . There are all kinds and conditions of gunsmiths practicing their trade today . There is plenty of reason to own a custom rifle . If a man wants a rifle lighter than ordinary because he finds a factory rifle in the caliber of his choice too heavy and burdensome to carry , he is justified in going to a custom maker . If he wants a rifle in some good wildcat caliber , a special barrel contour , or particularly fine wood , design , and lines to his own specifications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made up . Many people take great pleasure in the ownership of fine and handsome weapons that they have had a part in designing . The man who wants a special rifle should not expect to get one at a price comparable to that charged for a factory jot ) pro-  | duced by mass-production methods . The factories are equipped to run stocks on a copying lathe . They are set up for mass production . They turn out thousands of rifles exactly alike . Consequently they can make them more cheaply than the small custom maker . These factory rifles are strong , accurate , reliable , well stock for the average man . They have the fault , however , of looking exactly like many thousands of other rifles . For utilitarian purposes there is no better rifle made in the world today than the bolt-action Model 70 Winchester , which is chambered for a large number of excellent high-intensity cartridges . Some rifle enthusiasts do not like the Winchester Model 70 stock in spite of the fact that it is generally well bedded and fits the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrel is contoured or the weight . The man who simply wants finer wood and some engraving can have a special custom job done on a Model 70 at the Winchester factory . The custom rifle , however , will simply be a standard Winchester barrel and action that has been prettied up . Let us say that a man is going to start from scratch in having a rifle built up . He wants , let us say , a lightweight rifle with a 22-inch barrel . He wants good wood and he has his own notions about stock lines and shape . He can get a Model 1903 Springfield action or a good military or commercial Mauser action of the Model 98 type . He can have either of those actions altered to suit him . He can have , if he wishes , the floor plate hinged and a release button put in the trigger guard . He can have the bolt handle and safety altered for low scope mounting and the trigger guard streamlined . He can have a special lightweight zz-inch barrel fitted to any contour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design or type of engraving that comes to his mind . He can have a fine trap buck plate or even a trap pistol-grip cap made and fitted . He can have a fine custom-built stock superbly inletted , shaped , and checkered , and made of fine and showy wood to any shape and dimensions he wants . All of this , however , is going to cost him plenty of money . Depending on the  | details , this custom rifle will cost him from two to five times as much as the equivalent factory rifle . Custom rifles of almost any sort can be built by Griffin &; Howe , 202 East Forty-fourth Street , New York City ; P. O. Ackley ; Roy Weatherby , 8823 Long Beach Boulevard , South Gate , California ; Frank Pachmayr , 1220 South Grand Avenue , Los Angeles 15 , California ; Alvin Biesen , W. 2039 Sinto , Spokane , Washington ; or Lenard Brownell , Sheridan , Wyoming . Some craftsmen specialize in fine stocks and do no barrel and action work . Among them are , besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Charles Golueke , 1721 South Roosevelt Street , Green Bay , Wisconsin . The man who is skillful with his hands and has some knowledge of the use of tools can restock a rifle himself , and if he does a good job it will make him happy . He can obtain a rough turned and inletted blank from such firms as E. C. Bishop &; Sons , Warsaw , Missouri , or Rienhardt Fajin , also of Warsaw . He can fit such a stock to a Model 98 Mauser , a 1903 Springfield , or a 1917 Enfield . He can end up with a practical and often handsome rifle that will compare favorably with a good factory boltaction rifle at a considerable saving in money if he does not count the many weary hours he spends . Let us not forget that the ordinary " custom-made " rifle that is sold for anything like the price charged for a factory-produced bolt-action rifle is usually not much of a bargain . Often these rifles are turned out by people who are long on ambition but short on skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chambering is sloppy , the trigger pull is out of this world , and the stock work is enough to make a man 's blood run cold . The man who buys such a rifle should have it very thoroughly and carefully inspected by someone who knows rifles or else he is likely to get a lemon .  | Rim-Fire Cartridges IT IS paradoxical that rim-fire cartridges are at once a dying form of metallic cartridge and yet the most widely sold and widely used of all cartridges . In the larger calibers the rim-fire is gradually being dropped by the world 's loading companies , but in the form of the various . z2-caliber cartridges it is tremendously popular . The rim-fire cartridge with the priming compound enclosed in the folded head of the case was the first really successful form of metallic cartridge . It did not take long , however , to show that for the larger calibers and higher pressures the rim-fire case was not ideal . Gradually the big-caliber rim-fires dropped out of the picture . The last remaining survivor was the .41 Swiss rim-fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into World War II . It remained in demand because along in the late 188o 's or early ' 9o 's , tens of thousands of old Swiss army rifles were dumped over here , where they were sold for a few dollars to those who needed a cheap firearm for close-range deer hunting . Today a few .25 Stevens rim-fire cartridges are being loaded and also a few .32 Short and .32 Long cartridges . At the present time , however , no rifles are being made in those calibers and it is only a matter of time before those cartridges are obsolete . If the .25 Stevens were stepped up to high-velocity form and if a good accurate bolt-action rifle were brought out for it , it might regain some popularity , but the chances are against it .  | As a consequence , a discussion of the rim-fires means a discussion of the .22 'S . The father of all of them is the little BB cap , which is still loaded in Europe but is no longer loaded here . It consists of a .2z-caliber spherical ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 78o f.p.s. from the force of the exploding primer compound alone . Its big brother the CB cap uses a conical bullet weighing 29 grains at a velocity of 720 f.p.s . Before we go farther , we must bear in mind that all .22 rim-fire cartridges are named from their groove diameter rather than from their bore diameter , as is the usual practice . The bore diameter of the . zz barrel runs from .217 to .219 in .22 Short , Long , and Long Rifle . The only real .22 'S in the lot are the now obsolescent .22 W.R.F. and .22 Winchester Auto cartridges , which are used in barrels bored .220 and rifled .226 . While we are getting technical , the proper twist of rifling for the .22 Short is 1-24 , for the .22 Long I-20 , and for the .22 Long Rifle i-16 . The compromise twist for tubular repeaters that will handle Shorts , Longs , or Long Rifles interchangeably is 1-17 . The .22 Short is one of the most useful cartridges ever invented . It is small , light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine cartridge for gallery and indoor target shooting and for plinking around on tin cans and bottles . The .22 Long , on the other hand , is a pretty useless contraption . It uses the .22 Long Rifle case and the .22 Short bullet . The curious thing , though , is that the velocity of the . zz Long is no greater than that of the .22 Long Rifle , even with the lighter bullet . In reality it should be discontinued . The .22 Long Rifle is one of the most highly developed , most accurate , and most widely used cartridges in the world . Every week many hundreds of .22 match shooters fire thousands of matches with it and each one will lie down with literally hundreds of dollars ' worth of equipment scattered around him ? a fine .22 heavy-barrel match rifle , a fine scope , a spotting scope , a shooting jacket and mitt . To get in the money he has to keep most of his shots in the i-inch x-ring , and if he gets out of the  | 2-inch 10-ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put out special match ammunition in this caliber ? Winchester 's EZYXS , Remington 's Palma , and Western 's Xpert . This ammunition is loaded to velocities of around 115o f.p.s. , by the way , instead of up to 1375 as with the high-speed stuff . The reason velocity is held down with match ammunition is that .22 bullets traveling well above the speed of sound are much more windsensitive . As far as small-game hunting goes , the high-speed .22 cartridges that came out about 1931 add a great deal of killing power . They are made with brass instead of copper cases and they develop a good deal higher pressures than the old standardvelocity stuff . When these high-speed loads are given hollowpoint bullets , however , they are much more deadly . For small-game hunting , when anything but head shots are to be taken , the high-speed hollow-points should always be used . Really , the . zz solid bullets are pretty poor killers . I remember once when I was hunting ptarmigan , an arctic grouse about the size of a domestic pigeon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had thought that the .22 Long Rifle highvelocity solid bullet should kill one of those birds with a body hit . I knocked over four birds , but got only one . Another time I shot a ruffed grouse through the body at forty-five or fifty yards . He fell , but when I went to pick him up I found feathers but no grouse . From then on I shot only at the neck and head and did not lose a single bird I hit . A squirrel , which has a lot of vitality for its size , will carry off two or three solid bullets in the body . The man who likes squirrel hunting and is n't up to shooting the handsome little rodents in the head should use the high-velocity hollow-point loads by all means . The same applies to the cottontail . The .22 rim-fire is only a small-game cartridge , even with the high-speed hollow-point bullet . It is a small-game cartridge ? and I mean small . I know that someone will rise up and cry out that his Uncle Jake shot a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
