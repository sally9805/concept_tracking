MOSCOW , Dec. ** Big Three Foreign Ministers ' Conference is rapidly concluding its affairs . There was another meeting of the Ministers , Ambassadors and their immediate aides this afternoon . A final communique is likely tomorrow . The Moscow radio in a broadcast heard in London Wednesday night said the conference had ended . The broadcast said Secretary of State James F. Byrnes would hold a press conference in Moscow at 7:30 A. M. Thursday ( 11:30 P. M. Wednesday , Eastern standard time ) 1 Mr. Byrnes promises to give a press conference before leaving Moscow . His plane is ready , although weather conditions here are considered unpredictable at this time of year . The conference has now reached the stage of deciding details , which takes longer in some cases than general agreements . It is a most difficult part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 4 P. M. to 11 P. M. A note of cautious optimism about the results persists . There are going to be many important results of the main difficulties that have interrupted collaboration between the Big Three since early October . Optimism is being tinged with caution because implementation of agreements after conferences always creates difficulties that eventually require further conferences . But it is believed that something concrete has // been achieved in the relations of the Big Three Governments . For what appear to be merely temperamental reasons the French Government has hampered the progress of the conference , according to information received today . Although the French Government had ample time to consider the Foreign Ministers ' proposals in regard to peace treaties for the Balkan countries and Italy , it has given no reply to communications from the Moscow conference . Mr. Byrnes was unable to get Georges Bidault , the French Foreign Minister , on the telephone Monday when the time came to release the Big Three Foreign Ministers ' agreement . Monday 's release concerning the preparation of peace treaties with Italy , Rumania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governments of the Soviet Union , Great Britain and the United States announce that they have agreed and have requested the adherence of the Governments of France and China to the following procedure . " It will be recalled that the Foreign Ministers ' Council , of which France and China are members , failed to reach b as , reement in London in October because the Soviet Union wanted to limit the drafting of peace treaties to the Foreign Ministers of countries that had signed the surrender terms with the enemy countries in question , and the United States wanted a general peace conference . During the Council sessions in London , M. Bidault had an opportunity to express his views on peace treaties with all these countries and he understood the nature of the Soviet Union 's objections . Between the time of the London meeting and the current Big Three conference discussions on this subject have been proceeding through the ordinary diplomatic channels . The agreement announced Monday was one of the first , if not the first , agreement of the current session of this conference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace treaty with Italy since France was a signatory to the surrender terms for Italy . Drafting of the peace treaties for the Balkans and Finland also was limited to nations that signed the respective surrender terms . According to the Big Three proposal , France would also be a member of the general peace conference that will consider making recommendations for all the peace treaties in question before they are referred back to the respective nations for the final draft . During the period of these discussions the French Government has been fully informed of every step , and there never has been any indication of French objections . When agreement was reached in Moscow , the French and Chinese Governments were immediately informed . Despite relatively poor communications to China it is understood the Chinese Government was able to reply and in a tone that encouraged the current conference . But the French Government has remained silent . Feeling with the two other Foreign Ministers that the time had come to announce agreement and get the Foreign Ministers ' deputies in London at work again on drafts of treaties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noon , Paris time . He got the French Foreign Office on ' the telephone but M. Bidault could not be located . The French Government 's obvious reluctance to cooperate in the circumstances is interpreted as temperamental and a general tendency to put pride ahead of the actual business at hand . In general , American policy is to try to restore France to the level of a great nation as rapidly as possible , it is said . The temperamental vagaries of the French State are said to make relations difficult . When the current conference is concluded Mr. Byrnc3 is going directly to America without stopping in Paris , which is on the general route . France Expresses Displeasure PARIS , Dec. 26 ( U.P. ) ? The French Foreign Office tonight expressed its displeasure with the peace treaty decisions of the Big Three meetings in Moscow . Commenting on the Moscow decision to admit France to talks on treaties with the Balkan nations while not letting her sign those pacts , the Foreign Office spokesman said : " The outcome was a compromise that was not very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Finland and the Balkan countries , nevertheless we had moral and material interests there which should be taken into account . " Informants here considered that the result of the Moscow conference was a compromise with the Russian view that the French should have nothing to do with the Balkan treaties . It was felt that the Big Three would frame those treaties , and that any general conference of nations would have little to do with whether they were signed or not . Byrnes ' Flight Schedule WASHINGTON , Dec. 26 ( W ) ? Secretary of State Byrnes will leave Moscow by plane at 1:30 A. M. ( EST ) tomorrow for his return trip to Washington from the Big Three Foreign Ministers ' Conference , the State Department announced today .
