PLEASURES AND REGRETS ( 221 pp. ) - Marcel Proust-Lear-Crown ( $2.75 ) . <P> <P> Only a handful of Parisians read this anemic little book when it first appeared in 1896 . Few of them could have thought it likely that its author , a rather foppish and not very likable young social climber , would later devote the bulk of his adult life to composing one of the literary masterpieces of the times : Remembrance of Things Past . Even the most fanatical Proustians will have to grant that Pleasures and Regrets , now translated into English for the first time , is a trivial book . Languid little pseudo-pastoral sketches bedecked with whipped-cream imagery , pallid reflections on life and love in the sickliest fin de sicle manner , soft-jellied tales about soft-jellied love affairs-this is the picture the reader gets of the early Proust . <P> But if Pleasures and Regrets is read in anticipation of a masterpiece to come , it has considerable interest . In its pale pieces can be found many of Proust 's later themes : his view of human love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim to feverish pitches of feeling and then leaves him sated and bored ; his fascination with the workings of human memory , which he saw as a treacherous filter distorting the qualities and meanings of past experience ; and his complex attitude to high society , which delighted his snobbishness and shocked his moral feelings .
