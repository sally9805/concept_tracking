 | Barrymore Clown Prince of Denmark Condensed from Stage ( With supplementary material by the author ) J. P. McEvoy JOHN SINGER SARGENT once offered to paint John Barrymore 's portrait . Delighted , Barrymore stepped out to celebrate . The result was a major wassail , even for one whose wassailing is legendary . The next morning Barrymore was tenderly propped up in Sargent 's studio and arranged on the bias for the great master 's contemplation : Sargent made a professional inventory of the classic features and muttered : " Turn around . I want to see you fullface . " Barrymore aroused himself and roared indignantly , " That to me , who has gone through life side-saddle ? " Barrymore has made a professional triumph out of not letting the right side of his face know what the left side was doing . " My right profile , " said he once to Garbo , with whom he was doing a picture , " has all the expressive play of a morbid deep-sea fish . " Whereupon Garbo spent her noon hour rearranging the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affectionate clinch . " I was touched , " says john , " to think she would make that generous effort so the camera could wander up and down my left , or money-making , profile . " When the camera started rolling : however , Garbo was herself again . Pretending to stroke the Great Profile lovingly , she was really blocking John out with her hand and stealing the scene . But Barrymore was a trouper when Garbo was a barber . Tenderly he took hold of her wrist and bent her arm back , almost breaking it in the extravagance of his devotion . That lamed ' er . " When I came to the MGM studio the first time , I was permitted to dress on a remote part of the back lot , with the monkeys , " John reminisces moodily . " This was partly by choice , since I preferred monkeys to actors . I offered to buy one of them , he was so bright and attractive . His business manager came to see me . You want to buy Jiggs ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week , ' I told him , haughtily . " Diggs makes five thousand , ' replied the business manager . Maybe he will buy you . ' " A talented chimpanzee was Jiggs , but something of an ascetic . He neither drank , smoked , nor rode a bicycle , except when the part called for it . Living frugally , saving his money , he died early , surrounded by greedy relatives . It was a great lesson to me. "  | Born into a famous acting family , Barrymore as a youth spurned the stage and worked for some time as a newspaper artist , illustrating among other things Arthur Brisbane 's editorials in the New York journal . One remark of his father 's changed his life . " Do you want to be an artist and daub all your life , " roared Maurice Barrymore , " or , " and his well-trained voice dropped to a seductive coo , " do you want to be an actor , and ma-ake looooooove ? " Four wives and a four-lane worldround trail of fractured hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about names , dates , places . Even as to wives he must check them over on his fingers . " Oh , memories that bless and burn , " he says . " Let me see ? one , two , three seems to me there was another . Ah , yes , gallant women all . Now I am alone . All alone . " A delicate leer ripples up his left profile as a shower of feminine telephone numbers flutters out of his spectacle case . " Man was not made to live alone . I like it . " The assistant director comes to the door and murmurs respectfully , " Scene ready ; we 're waiting for you , Mr. Barrymore . " The set is a scientific laboratory . An assistant hidden from the camera holds up a blackboard on which are written Barrymore 's lines . Barrymore plays the scene reading his lines off the blackboard with incredible ingenuity . One " take " and he is back in his dressing room . " They say you ca n't memorize your parts . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recite from memory three plays of Shakespeare from beginning to end . But listen to this ? " He picked up the blackboard and read from the scene just made : " So you see , the entire principle is the coordination of chemical , biological and dynamic influences . ' Can you tell me , " he sneered , " why I should clutter my mind with that etymological or-dure ? " Even if I did memorize a speech , " he continued , " they would rewrite it . Besides , I use a blackboard the way acrobats use a net . It 's insurance . It 's a pretty good trick , too . A lot of stars have tried it , but they ca n't act and read at the same time . " He wants to do Macbeth in the Hollywood Bowl . " How would you get a blackboard big enough ? " scoffed his pal , Gene Fowler . " I 'll have airplanes , " cracked Barrymore , " skywriting ! " Barrymore has cultivated a protective forgetfulness . He can not remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to keep , addresses he wishes to avoid . He carries no watch and the only clock in his house strikes three when it 's eleven and fourteen at two-thirty . He autographs his photos with the date 1924 and does n't admit that anything has happened since . The entrance to his estate , high on the highest Beverly Hill , is  | barred by a huge oaken gate but anyone can get in merely by-knocking . For as much as Barrymore claims to enjoy his solitude , he is always lonely for someone to talk to . Autograph hunters are always dropping in . So are sheriffs , who continue to carry away furniture . " There was a bench outside the door , " says Barrymore . " One of my wives took that . " " Ca n't you remember which one ? " " Could you ? " he roared . " By the way , when did Elaine leave you ? " " Out here where there is no summer , winter , or spring , how the devil could a man tell ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no furniture in the main house except one bed . " I 'm the outdoor type , " Barrymore explained . The gardener is an incredibly wrinkled Japanese , who speaks no English . Barrymore uses him to answer the phone . If Nichi is not available when the phone rings Barrymore answers it himself , imitating Nichi . The number is a private one , changed so often Barrymore himself never knows it . His male nurse keeps the number jotted down on slips of paper . He also keeps Barrymore 's pocket money , which he doles out as the actor needs it . " He always asks for twentyfive dollars when he 's going out for the evening , " says the nurse . " But I never let him have more than ten , in one-dollar bills so that it feels like a lot . " Usually the nurse accompanies Barrymore , making change , paying taxis , and seeing to it that Barrymore gets to his appointments on time and back home before daybreak . Since Barrymore never drives , he still does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts as bodyguard , dresser and bartender . He carries a suitcase containing bottles of mixed fruit juice and rum . Barrymore pours you a drink , saying , " Be careful . This is strong stuff . " And then tips up the bottle and empties it . Wickedly he swigs all day , defiantly pleased with himself for breaking the rules , and has yet to discover that the nurse puts little or no rum in the drinks . Barrymore himself will tell you , with pardonable pride , that he was a Homeric guzzler in his day . Today his internal organs have organized a little W.C.T.U. of their own . Where a quart was once a joust , a jigger is now a jag . " Yes , I 've been on the wagon , " he confesses . " But some years ago a couple of good friends of mine stopped drinking suddenly and died in frightful agony . I said then that such a thing would never happen to me . " Hollywood is a whispering gallery , and in every corner there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , few of them ever meet him and none of them knows him intimately . He may be  | a profile to his public , but in his home town he is just a rumor . One nationally syndicated columnist livens up the tedium of her daily chore by inventing tall tales of temperamental fits , cosmic carousals , and Stuka assaults on timorous feminine convoys . Barrymore dismisses her affectionately : " A quaint old udder . " Barrymore owes $6o,000 , makes $5000 a week kidding himself in the movies . The creditors get four thousand of this . Of the remainder an undisclosed amount goes to the support of two minor children and several of his ex-wives , including his latest , " the fair Elaine , " better known as " Ariel . " She divorced her " Caliban " in November , after innumerable public brawls and reconciliations . He is elaborately friendly with his other ex-wives ( " Kid McCoy and Jim Corbett shook hands , did n't they ? " ) but " the fair Elaine " and her " lady mother " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he speaks of them with Old-World gallantry : " Elaine is the kind of girl who will not go anywhere without her mother . And her mother will go anywhere . " Barrymore has made and lost several fortunes . Once he roamed the seas in his palatial yacht , The Infanta , for months at a time . He filled his great estate on the hill with fantastic quantities of loot , ranging from totem poles from the Isle of the Dead to a pair of shrunken heads from Ecuador . History of obtaining the heads by lending a native a .22 rifle and sending him off with three bucks and his blessing is probably apocryphal . The creditors took the yacht , but they could n't take Barrymore 's memories , which include The Infanta 's christening . Handing Dolores Costello , then his wife , the ceremonial bottle of champagne , he asked her to break it on the bow . " It 's too heavy , " she said . " I 'm afraid I ca n't . " " Go ahead . Just think it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tells it . " She smashed the bottle into a million pieces , " says he . " Damn near wrecked the boat . " Anyone who has ever joined the Barrymore clan glows for him with a special luster . Disarmingly frank is his list of the ten most glamorous women he has ever known . His grandmother leads off , followed by his aunt , Mrs. John Drew , his four wives ( Katherine Harris , Michael Strange , Dolores Costello and Elaine Barrie ) , his sister Ethel , and his daughter Diane . Running out of female relatives , he , reluctantly throws in Katharine Hepburn , Carole Lombard and Greta Garbo . Glamorous or no , Barrymore finds most women amusing and all of them unpredictable . " You mean you have n't arrived at any definite philosophy about women by this time ? " I asked .  | A stentorian snort : " Ye gods , man ? it 's not like stamp collecting . " Suspicious of people , Barrymore has complete faith in animals . His pet monkey , Clementine , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the hour opposite Barrym0re , holding her little face in her hands and looking at him with unutterable devotion : It was only after he had to choose between giving up his family or giving Clementine to the zoo that he learned from the zoo veterinarian that Clementine had been fascinated , not by the Great Profile , but by the alcoholic fumes . Thereafter Barrymore made special trips to the zoo , to breathe lovingly on Clementine by the hour . Barrymore bought Maloney , his pet vulture , in Panama and took him on all his cruises . The vulture would sit on the actor 's shoulder and preen the Barrymore eyebrows and mustache , to the fascinated horror of the ruffian crew . One day Barrymore noticed the vulture was drooping and making disconsolate noises . Perhaps civilization is palling on him , thought Jack . So the yacht was turned around and steamed from Seattle down to lower Mexico . Taking the vulture ashore , Barrymore set him clown on the beach , surrounded him with dainties and kissed him good-bye . Back on the yacht @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old friend , set adrift in a foreign land . Next morning , still sitting on deck as the sun rose , he called for his binoculars . Sure enough , there was Maloney on the beach where he had left him . " There were tears in his eyes , " says Barrymore . " What could I do ? " He leaped for the boat , pulled for shore and brought back Maloney , ecstatically happy once more . Barrymore is almost 60 now , his hair thinning and graying , but he is buoyant , supple , amazingly trim . Doctors look him over , shake their heads and throw away their books . Detractors who say Jack has only a third of a brain left add admiringly that he is still the keenest wit , the most felicitous storyteller and the most adroit actor on stage or screen . A natural comedian , he is the only clown in theatrical history who achieved the clown 's traditional ambition to play Hamlet ( a record-breaking Hamlet that ran more than 100 performances on Broadway and triumphed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  - -  in the stage play , My Dear Children , in the picture , the Great Profile ? kidding his own performance of himself kidding himself . " Why should I let Menjou imitate me ? I know more about how much of a ham I am . Besides , my creditors need the money . " How true ! Even the studio shooting schedule had to be arranged around the court calendar .  | Extravagant , eccentric , uninhibited , a master of voice , gesture and Rabelaisian invective , he lives in a lustrous past while dramatizing the harassments of a tarnished present . Barrymore the man , the husband , the father , the lover , the friend , is Barrymore the actor , playing all these as roles . On his yacht he strutted a plutocratic wastrel . In his dusty , desolate shell of a home he revels in one of his juiciest roles ? the great tragedian , alone , forsaken , decaying in elegant squalor . Are his friends sorry for him ? Do the critics bewail his present lack of dignity ? Are his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepts all this as a well-earned tribute to the masterly technique of a superb third act . In Hollywood today , shrewdly capitalizing his mistakes , so numerous and appalling they would have sunk anyone less resilient and resourceful , Barrymore is Hamlet in a high school play , surrounded by sweating amateurs who creakily portray roles he could shake out of his sleeve . Their Academy Awards , their trade paper laurels , their gold-plated Oscars amuse and sadden him , for the Monster ( as his intimates dub him ) knows now that all acting is illusion and the last reward thereof is disillusion .
