 | Tracked by Bloodhounds Condensed from The Saturday Evening Post Daniel P. Mannix THE POSSE had trailed Ray Olson , suspected kidnaper , to an isolated cabin near Cable , Wis . As two deputies cautiously approached the door Olson shot them both , grabbed their guns and plunged into the woods . No one dared follow . The sheriff then ordered : " Get George Brooks and his bloodhounds . " Brooks , a lean , serious-faced man who lives in La Crosse , is one of the few people in the world who know the ancient and curious art of working bloodhounds . In the last 15 years he has been called out on more than 2000 cases . His dogs have tracked down murderers , wandering children , escaped lunatics , convicts and lost campers . In the Olson case George Brooks tackled one of his toughest jobs . " To work bloodhounds , " he exmust have walked around the deputies ' bodies . There was no scent guide , nothing I could be sure only Olson had handled . plains , " you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scent guide ' ? something he has handled for the dogs to smell . By the time I got to Cable a thousand people " So I took the dogs out half a mile from the cabin and cut a great circle . They hit a trail and looked up at me inquiringly . I said , Man gone , boys ! ' and they struck out . For three days 175 possemen and I followed that trail . We came on the smoldering ruins of cabins . Olson burned every place he slept in , to make sure he would n't leave a scent . The hounds would just circle the smoking remains and pick up his trail on the other side . "  | Then Olson hid out in the Chippewa Flowage , a lake region studded with tiny islands . Knowing that scent wo n't lie on water , he built rafts and traveled for miles along the inlets . But sooner or later he had to land and the hounds always picked up the trail . After two weeks Olson made a short cut across country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Olson must be headed for a distant lake . Part of the posse went on by car to cut him off . When they arrived at the lake they sighted Olson running for a boat . Before he had taken a dozen steps , he was riddled by slugs . George . Brooks has no interests except his dogs . He never reads a magazine or book and has never seen a sound motion picture . In order to stay up with his hounds , he keeps in hard condition , lives almost entirely on ground round steak . George was born 51 years ago in Onalaska , Wis . As a young man he trained bird dogs , then started raising bloodhounds . " You can work them all year round , and once you 've seen the big dogs on a trail you forget about any other kind of hunting , " he says . George had intended to be a pharmacist , but at college he ran out of money and got a job at the Bodega Lunch Club in La Crosse as a soda clerk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . When he gets a call to go out with his dogs ? usually he gets three or four a week ? he leaves the store for a few hours or , occasionally , days . William Bonadurer , who owns the store , says , " George never charges for the use of his hounds . They have done a tremendous amount of good , and if he can spare the time and money I guess I can spare him . " George 's first dog , Lady , was only four months old when he imported her from England in 1932 . He had scarcely got the pup bedded down in his garage when a local sheriff called . " I heard you just got a bloodhound , " said the official . " Bring her right over . Three men robbed a bank in Mindoro . We shot one through the windshield of their car . The other two took to the woods . " George tried to explain that Lady was only a puppy , untrained and weakened by a long trip . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour , " said the sheriff . An hour later George and Lady arrived at the smashed car , the body of the dead bank robber still lying beside it . Lady began to trail instinctively , which is unusual for an untrained dog . She traced the fugitives to the shore of the Black River . The sheriff decided that the men had swum the stream , but Lady refused to leave the spot . Finally the sheriff insisted that George drag the dog away and try her on the far bank . Lady could not pick up the scent . Later both robbers were caught and George made a trip to the penitentiary to find , out how they 'd thrown off his dog . The men laughed , " We was lyin '  | under water a couple of yards offshore , breathing through hollow reeds . If you 'd turned that pup loose , she 'd have got us . " Since then George has owned more than 40 bloodhounds . He considers five of them truly great . Bloodhounds are bred to have a big , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can fan up particles of scent when the dog is sniffing , and drooping ears that form a pocket back of the dog 's nose to trap scent when the dog is running with his head up . But a really fine nose in a dog is a gift , like a great operatic voice in a human . Also , the dog must be willing to work for days following a single scent and have the heart to stand up under hardship . Often George will train a dog for more than a year only to find the hound ca n't take the punishment of a tough assignment . George trains his dogs by having an assistant some distance away call the pup to him . The assistant feeds the dog , which is delighted by this new game . After a few days the assistant runs around a corner when the dog starts for him , leaving behind a handkerchief or some other scent guide . George encourages the dog to smell the handkerchief , saying , " Man gone ! " Gradually the trailing is made more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dog will learn to puzzle out a scent on a crowded sidewalk and through heavy traffic . After a while the dog lives for nothing but to untangle trails . George always keeps his dogs on leash . A bloodhound following a trail is indifferent to everything else and will walk in front of a speeding car or straight into an oncoming train . A bloodhound is powerful , and on a hot scent nearly goes crazy pulling on the leash , so George wears a wide belt and the leashes snap into rings set in the heavy leather . A man with the leashes in his hands ca n't stand the strain for more than an hour or two , but with the belt George can keep going for days , although he is black and blue from the constant jerking . Hounds that run free must give tongue so their master can follow , but George teaches his dogs to run mute . A lost child can become so frightened by the baying of a hound that he may run off a cliff or into a river . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be exercised every day , and since George refuses to take them out of their pens without putting them on a scent , he hires youngsters to lay trails for them at 25 cents per trail . The children call it " playing Eliza " and try all sorts of tricks , but George believes there is no way to fool bloodhounds . Most people have a vague idea that a man somehow impregnates his footprints with his scent . Actually , scent is given off all over the body . It remains hanging in the air like a fine mist after a person has passed . Then it slowly falls to the ground . Bloodhounds can frequently air-scent a man half a mile away if a moist wind is blowing toward  | them . A friend once bet George that no dog could catch him . He spent hours laying a complicated path and then circled back to watch the hounds work . When George gave the hounds the scent guide the dogs paid no attention to the trail . They simply walked over to where the man was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so determined to trick the hounds that they spent an hour struggling through a swamp up to their waists in cold water . As the dogs approached the swamp , they air-scented the boys ' fresh trail on the far side , circled the marsh and caught up with the exhausted boys in five minutes . A dog is occasionally able to follow a man even if the man is in a car . George 's dogs were called in to run down a filling-station robber . He put the hounds on the broken till . The dogs followed the scent for five blocks . Then they signaled , by sitting down , that the man had done something different ? in this case he had been picked up by a car . Suddenly King , the best dog George has ever owned , started sniffing again . He went on for a block and a half to where the man had got out of the car and gone into his house . King might have air-scented the fresh trail ahead , but there was a strong breeze blowing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car windows , the scent catching at the base of the buildings . In soft , moist earth scent may last almost two weeks . On hot , dry earth it disappears after a few hours . Apparently some of the scent sinks into the ground , for on a cold trail a dog will scratch in the earth , sniff and then go on . Hounds will deliberately turn over leaves to get a trace of odor clinging there . George thinks the most remarkable feat of trailing that his dogs have performed occurred in Eitzen , Minn . A man had vanished after leaving a suicide note and a posse had been looking for him for nearly a week . They found his car abandoned on a side road , and George put King on the faint scent . King took the posse to Dorchester , across the line in Iowa . The dog continued to work up the sidewalk although many people must have walked over the six-day-old trail . The supposed suicide was located in a restaurant having lunch . The biggest assignment George has had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmer who got into an argument with neighbors , shot four of them , then took to the woods . The murders occurred during a drought . Dry ground makes poor tracking , but for four days the posse followed the dogs through dense forests . From breathing the hot , dry dust George 's famous King developed a lung hemorrhage . He still kept on . On the fifth day the dogs were going through a cornfield when King stopped and dug up a gnawed corncob . Jens had stopped to get food and had buried the cob . During the next ten days George  | slept on the trail . At one place the desperate fugitive jumped A small cliff . The dogs took the leap with George hanging onto their leashes . In a last attempt to throw off the dogs Jens took nearly a day to climb an almost unscalable hill and then doubled back parallel to his own trail . On his way down it began to rain . As the dogs approached the hill , they scented the fresh trail in the moist air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track . The exhausted fugitive surrendered without a struggle . Next to tracking down criminals , most of George 's cases are concerned with lost children . Bloodhounds are perfect for this work , but many parents are afraid to have them used under the mistaken notion that thev will maul a child . Actually , bloodhounds are quite gentle . They were originally developed as hunting dogs , and the term " bloodhound " simply meant that they were blooded hounds in the same sense ? as blooded horses . Many persons have asked George why he does n't give up his job as a soda clerk and make bloodhounds his business . " If I did that , I could n't take the clogs on a case without demanding a Ice , " George told me . " A lot of my calls come from people who ca n't afford to pay : a farmer whose wife has wandered off in a blizzard or a fisherman whose kid has got lost . At the store 1 'm assured of a steady income , and I can take the hounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it . "
