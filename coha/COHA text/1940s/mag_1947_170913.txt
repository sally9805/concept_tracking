One day last week a tall , powerfully built man stepped out of the board room at T.W.A. headquarters in Kansas City , Mo. , peeled off his coat , shouted to a friend , " I feel pretty good now , Swede , let 's wrestle . " LaMotte Turck Cohu , 51 , felt pretty good because he had just been elected president of T.W.A. to replace Jack Frye . <P> In " Mot " Cohu ( rhymes with show-you ) , T.W.A. had an experienced pilot at the stick . A World War I Navy flyer , Cohu first peddled aviation securities before he moved into the operating end of the industry . In 1930 he started Interstate Airlines , now part of Eastern Air-Lines , moved on to become a director and president of Aviation Corp . in its early , money-losing days . With Jack Northrop , Cohu organized Northrop Aircraft , Inc. in 1939 , served as its board chairman and general manager until he resigned a fortnight ago . <P> T.W.A. Boss Howard Hughes , who got tired of hearing Frye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a close personal friend of Hughes and a T.W.A. director since 1933 , Mot Cohu has decided opinions about how an airline should be run . He intends to cut out what he calls " the fancy gadgets " and overlapping services , steer the company along more conservative lines . He believes that T.W.A. expanded too fast and too far , frequently questioned Frye 's enthusiasm for developing overseas routes at the expense of domestic service . <P> Most airmen guessed that Cohu would not have as free a hand with the airline as Jack Frye had . Hughes had come close to losing control of his line once , and he was smart enough not to take that chance again . By virtue of drastic payroll cuts Hughes had pushed through-and the spring increase in airline traffic-T.W.A. was doing much better than last winter , when it lost $1,000,000 a month . It hopes that this month it may even break even .
