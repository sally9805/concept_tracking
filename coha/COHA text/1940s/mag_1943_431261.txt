AMERICANS are smoking more in wartime than they have ever smoked before , and the huge American tobacco industry , as a consequence , is booming as it has never boomed in its long history . The demand for cigarettes last year broke all previous records . According to tax-paid withdrawals of tobacco from Governmentbonded factories , cigarette sales totaled 235,839,000,000 , a rise of 14.3 percent over the 1941 figure . The final accounting on cigars is not in yet , but the Department of Agriculture , which watches over the progress of smoking like an anxious mother , estimates that well over 6,000,000,000 have gone up in a vast cloud of fragrant smoke . In addition , about 350,000,000 pounds of pipe and chewing tobacco and snuff have been consumed by 16,000,000 users . Preliminary estimates for 1943 indicate that smoking will continue to increase , although not so sharply as last year . Why are people smoking so much ? The tobacco industry has a simple answer : wartime prosperity is enabling people to spend more money on luxuries . They point to the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be other  | factors , of course , such as the heightened nervous tension of hard work , which smoking eases . What with the industry having more than a billion dollars invested in plant and equipment , retail tobacco sales this year may reach the staggering total of $2,000,000,000 . And because smoking keeps civilian and military morale high , the Government has declared tobacco an industry essential in wartime . What , after all , is this marvelous household weed whose history of recreation and pleasure began when Columbus landed in San Salvador ? Botanically , tobacco is any one of several plants of the genus Nicotiana , while the chief American species is N. tabacum . Jean Nicot , the Frenchman who brought the leaf to Catherine de Medici in 1561 ( and never seems to have done anything else worth mentioning ) , is immortalized in the name of the genus and of the clear colorless liquid with the chemical formula C , 0H ? Nz , which is the characteristic alkaloid of tobacco , nicotine . Chemically , tobacco contains two percent nicotine in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lighter types are the better West Indian leaves ; the strongest are the rank French and German crops . The nature and proportion of tobacco 's chemical constituents are largely determined by the conditions under which it is grown , as well as by the curing and fermentation of the leaf . Analyses of tobacco show that it also contains :  | Tobacco smoke is difficult to analyze , but generally it contains varying percentages of nicotine ( but never as much as the unburned leaf ) , aldehydes such as furfural and acrolein , methane , hydrogen cyanide , hydrogen sulphide , organic acids , empyreumatic oils , phenols , pyridine , picoline , ammonia , carbon dioxide , carbon monoxide , water , and tarry distillates . The ash is generally composed of potash , lime , sodium chloride , and magnesia , in quantities ranging from nine to 40 percent . In addition there also are small percentages of soda , sulphuric acid , silica , and calcium phosphate . The ammonia and acrolein are the chief irritants in tobacco smoke . Curiously enough , smoke from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ammonia , and is more irritating to the eyes than smoke expelled from the mouth or nose , which has an acid reaction . The great controversy about nicotine will probably rage as long as there are smokers and nonsmokers . Generally , the best scientific opinion is that nicotine is no more harmful to the average person than the caffeine in coffee or tea . However , the amount of nicotine in tobacco " has no strict relation " to that in the smoke . This is the opinion of Dr. Walter S. Mendenhall , professor of pharmacology in the School of Medicine of Boston University . Tests reveal that the manner of smoking may have much more to do with increasing the nicotine content of the smoke than the tobacco itself . A violentlypuffed , rapidly smoked cigarette commonly throws off a lot more nicotine than one consumed at a leisurely rate . The same is true of the irritating aldehydes , which may be greater in a fast-smoked , hot cigarette than in a cooler one . Much of the tar and other waste products in smoke are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette or a cigar . Tobacco is a wonderfully adaptable plant and can be grown almost anywhere in the world . There 's a catch in this , however ; while adaptable , tobacco is extremely sensitive to conditions of soil and climate . For example , two such different types of seed as Zimmer Spanish and Connecticut broadleaf , when grown side by side , produce leaves which can scarcely be told apart . Yet when the former is grown in the Miami River Valley of Ohio and the latter in Connecticut , the Zimmer Spanish crop makes good filler for domestic cigars , while the broadleaf makes silky cigar wrapper . This peculiarity also works in reverse : North Carolina has four principal tobacco-growing regions , or " belts . " Plants from one belt simply will not grow at all in another , even though only a creek or a hill separates them . With minor differences , growing tobacco is the same in Sumatra , Virginia , Asia Minor , or wherever commercial tobacco is raised . In Cuba , for example , the rich loam of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Havana crop , rests after the winter harvest till June . After fertilization and the summer rains , the fields are plowed and more fertilizer is applied . In the fall there is intensive cultivation by plow , harrow , and drag to prepare the fields to receive the brownish seed , so fine that a teaspoonful will produce an acre of plants . Safeguarded from weeds and insects , the seedlings grow for 40 days . In December , transplating begin ; all plants that show signs of dying are replaced after a few days with strong ones . If the tobacco is to be shade-grown for wrapper , men on stilts spread huge bolts of cheesecloth on frames eight feet high to protect the leaves from the sun . When the plant is several feet high , buds  | begin to appear , which if allowed to flower would draw strength from the leaves . In a process called " topping , " they are nipped off by hand . At the same time , sick-looking leaves are removed , as well as large numbers of new shoots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have about 12 to 14 leaves . Although the growing procedure is virtually the same , there are many differences in curing . Cigar tobacco , generally , is cured by fermentation alone , no artificial heat being used . In the cigarette-tobacco regions of Virginia , North Carolina , and Kentucky , heat is used in fire-curing and flue-curing , while sun-and-air curing is similar to the fermentative method commonly employed in Cuba . Flue-curing bright yellow tobacco in Virginia and North Carolina is probably the  | most difficult task of the tobacco planter . Smoke enters the curing barn through flues . Drying the leaves rapidly to obtain the yellow tint requires 90 degrees F. of heat for 36 hours , then two hours at 100 degrees . Every two hours thereafter the temperature is increased 2.5 degrees until the critical point of 110 degrees is reached . Now the yellow color appears , but from there on it rests entirely upon the judgment and skill of the planter how long the heat should be applied . It may take from four to eight hours , and constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the tips begin to curl , the temperature must be raised again , at first to 120-125 degrees , then , after four to eight hours , to 170 degrees , in steps of 5 degrees at a time . This " fixes " the color by driving out all the sap , oils , and moisture , and makes the leaf one of the finest ingredients of a cigarette , highly prized here and in Great Britain . Curing Havana tobacco is done entirely by " bulking " the leaves ? that is , heaping them in piles weighing as much as 5,000 pounds . Now a mysterious chemical and bacteriological phenomenon called " sweating " takes place . The moisture in the leaves and the pressure of the upper leaves on the lower ones cause the temperature to rise to 117-120 degrees . This fermentation destroys oils , sap , and juices , and develops " smoking " qualities , as well as a dark-brown color . While it goes on , bulks must be continually rebuilt so that the upper leaves can be placed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief that any addition to tobacco is of necessity a " dope " or an " adulterant , " which impairs the purity of the product . The fact is that pure , harmless flavoring essences are widely used in pipe and chewing tobaccos , snuff , many cigarettes , and some cigars . " Casing " tobacco is done by swishing it in a flavoring broth just after it has been cured . " Bouqueting " is performed by spraying essences on the tobacco . Casing and bouqueting formulas are closely guarded trade secrets of the manufacturers . Many exotic essences are used : the Biblical myrrh , honey from the mangrove flowers of Santo Domingo , tonka beans from Venezuela , imported licorice , deer 's tongue , St. John 's bread ( a Mediterranean bean ) , and essential oils of fig , rose , and geranium . Like wine , tobacco has gathered about it a curious collection of folklore , little of which is true . Many people , for instance , believe that a light-colored cigar is necessarily mild . Actually the strength of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filler . Another misconception is that a white ash is proof of superior tobacco . In reality it means only that a cigar is burning properly . Nicotine is usually held responsible for finger stain from cigarettes . The truth is the discoloration is caused by distilled vegetable tars.  |
