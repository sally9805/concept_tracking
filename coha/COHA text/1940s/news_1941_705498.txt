txt Credits now allowed individuals in calculating their net income for surtax purposes probably will be reduced sharply in the forthcoming revenue bill . Tax authorities here estimate that more than $225 million additional revenue could be realized by disallowing the personal exemption and credit for dependents as deductions in computing net income subject to surtaxes . There is a strong belief among them that this step will be taken . This development in the tax picture coincided with a new flurry of speculation on Capitol Hill as to the amount of additional revenue to be sought and the methods to be followed in raising it . George and Taft Give Views Senator George ( Dem. , Ga. ) expressed the belief that between $1 is billion and $2 billion of additional revenue would be sought . He and Senator Taft ( Repn , Ohio ) agreed that it might be necessary to raise the normal rate on individual incomes from 4% to 8% and the rate on corporations from 24% to 30% to meet the revenue requirements . The expected reduction in the credits now allowed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature of the much broader program to swell federal receipts through steep increases in tax rates on individual and corporate incomes and through new and increased excise levies . This program will begin to take on definite form when joint discussions between the congressional tax committees and Treasury officials get under way later this month . Disallowance of the personal exemptions ( $800 for single persons and $2,000 for married persons . and the $400 credit for dependents ) as deductions for surtax purposes would increase the surtax yield from all income groups . Ir ? would have the effect of pushing more income  --  an amount equal to the deduction  --  mto the highest bracket of each surtax payer . Reach Maximum of 75% As the law now stands , surtax net income means the amount of the net income in excess of the personal exemption and the credit allowed for dependents . The first $4,000 of this income is exempt from surtaxes , which start at the rate of 4% on income between $4,000 and $6.000 and reach a maximum of 75% on income in excess of $5,000.000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five children . He has net income of 514.000 . In determining his surtax net income , be deducts $4,000  --  the $2,000 personal exemp- ' tion and the $400 credit for each of his children . His surtax net income is $10,000 . He pays no surtax on the first $4,000 ; he pays 4% , or 580. on the income between $4,000 and $6,000 , he pays 6% or $120. on the income between $6,000 and $8.000 : and , he pays 8%. or $160 , cn the income between $8,000 sand $10,000 . His total surtaxes arnoUnt to $360 . Under the suggested change , his surtax bill would be more than doubled . It would v.ork this way : Not getting a seduction for the personal exemption and for his dependent children , he would start with a surtax net income of $14 , - 000 instead of $10.000 . This additional $4,000 of surtax net income would fall in higher , brackets . He would pay $360 on the first $10,000 of his income .

In other words , the present deduction was worth $440 to Mr. Smith . The value of these deductions increases as income goes into higher brackets and is subject to increased rates . It Mr. Smith had surtax net income of $150,000 , the deductions would be worth $2,400 , since the surtax rate on income between $150,000 and $200.000 is 60%  --  the rate which would be applicable to that portion of his income now covered by the deduction . If the change suggested is made , it is possible that a cushion of some form , designed to soften the rate of tax increase in the lower surtax brackets , will be provided .
