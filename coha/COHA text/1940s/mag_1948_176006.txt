The word went round Jersey Joe Walcott 's training camp that Champion Joe Louis was worried . He actually sent a spy over to scout the enemy . But when the champ 's agent arrived , Walcott 's men gave him the eye-and the bum 's rush . They had him halfway out the door before Jersey Joe intervened . " Let him watch , " he ordered . Then Challenger Walcott , using pillowy 16-oz. gloves , neatly flattened a sparring partner . Said he : " Tell Nicholson to take that back to Louis . " <P> Since December , when he punched Big Joe to the floor twice ( and lost the fight on a controversial decision ) , Jersey Joe has acted like a kid cheated out of his marbles and determined to get them back . He began training far ahead of schedule-while Big Joe , eating his way to a blubbery 225 Ibs. , was seeing London and Paris . He hired the roughest &; toughest sparring mates he could find . He pulled no punches in sparring sessions at his New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new left hook . It put one sparring mate on the floor with his ears humming . Another got knocked flat twice . The boys who dropped in for a look hustled back to town to find a bookie and make a bet . Walcott 's odds , once a tempting 4 to 1 , fell sharply . By week 's end , they were 11 to 5 , and would probably be lower by next week when Jersey Joe takes his second shot at Joe Louis ' crown . <P> The Fever . In his training camp at an amusement park overlooking a pond , Jersey Joe ( real name : Arnold Cream ) likes to sneak off to his room and play the phonograph , singing along with his favorite Ink Spots and Savannah Churchill records . At night he talks by telephone with each of his six kids . When he 's a little low in spirits , he reads his well-thumbed Bible : " The Bible gives me lots of imagination ... it really picks me up . " Nobody heard much about him until he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis* ) because , he says , of that case of typhoid fever . He came down with it 14 years ago , just when he was beginning to go places as a young fighter . " I could always punch , " he is quick to say . But the fever left him weak . Undertrained and undernourished after living on relief , he made a try at a comeback , finally quit because he could make more money ( $85 a week ) as a wartime shipyard worker . It took a lot of talking by glib Felix Bocchiccio , a small-time Camden promoter , to lure him back into the fight racket . Bocchiccio supplied two vital things he lacked before-management and money-and Jersey Joe began punching his way into the headlines . <P> The Future . Even with Bocchiccio picking up the tab , Walcott is one of the skimpiest eaters big-time heavyweight boxing has ever known . After a five-mile run he breakfasts on prunes , two eggs , a lamb chop , tea and toast . Then comes a mile walk , a nap until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' workout in the afternoon . For supper he does not wolf a 3-lb. steak ( as Billy Conn used to ) , but settles for a smaller one . He looks lighter than his 196 Ibs . Most remarkable about him is the fact that he seems to get better just when most boxers get worse-after 30.
