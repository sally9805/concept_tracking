I wonder if small boys still get up at three o'clock of a morning to see the circus come to town . Years ago no boy worth his salt would have thought of letting a circus slip into town without being at the freight yard to greet it . That was a rite as essential to the celebration of circus day as seeing the Big Show itself . To do the thing properly you had to live in a small town . From five to fifteen thousand was the ideal population a boy should have been born in to see a circus arrive , and if he neglected to arrange this matter in advance , he had only himself to blame . When I was a boy with cheek of tan and a pair of corduroy pants that I hated because they went swishswosh when I walked , a lot of mighty fine circuses came to visit us ? Barnum &; Bailey , Forepaugh and Sells , Ringling Brothers , Buffalo Bill 's Wild West Show ? all the topnotchers . Weeks before the great day , billposters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small boy 's reason . Magnificent , gold-colored tigers bared their fangs at you from the Hustings ; also titanic elephants and ravishing snake charmers garlanded with slithery green boa constrictors . After contemplating these vivid murals for a week , a boy took to uttering cries in his sleep , and his value as a chore performer around the house was likely to plummet sharply . It was important for a small male circus fan to choose his ancestors carefully , as well as his town . There was no greater object of pity than the unfortunate burdened with parents who put their foot down on such " nonsense " as getting up at three in the morning to see a circus come in . Nonsense , indeed ! Happily , my contemporary , Jack Swartfigure , and I possessed ancestors who stood without hitching . When I would say , " Momma , c'n I get up tomorrow with Jack to see the circus c ? me in ? " my mother would most likely answer , " What in heaven 's name do you want to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not a veto . She had given up trying to figure why small boys wanted to do the things they did , having raised three . Jack and I devised our own alarm clock for these occasions . We lived in a two-family house . Prior to retiring on the eve of the circus , one end of a stout cord thirty feet long was attached to Jack 's big toe . It led from his big toe out of his window , across the porch roof to our side of the house , into my room and onto my big toe . Whoever woke up first just yanked the other out of bed . Then we sped through the dark , sleeping village to the freight yard a mile away , awakening irate robins with our eager prattle . At the freight yard , like as not , there was already a sizable company of young Grover Whalens , and pretty soon somebody hollered , " There she comes ! " and the circus train loomed up in the mist and a few moments later chugged and clanked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures trickled off the train , and the circus began to wake up . The roustabouts set to work unloading . Loud demands for breakfast came from inside the animal wagons ? came , we realized with a- thrill , from those awesome man-eaters who had been menacing us from the billboards for the past month . Sleep-stained , raincoated men and women emerged from the cars . They looked unkempt , but we were not fooled . We knew that in a few hours a magic wand would transform them into glorious , bespangled creatures who would perform breathtaking feats of grace and daring on the backs of milk-white chargers or on rings miles up in the air . Before rosy-fingered dawn had a chance to yawn , the circus was on its way to the lot , with us in hot pursuit . Presently the lot  | rang with the thump of sledges on tent poles . As if at a conjurer 's nod , tents popped up ; the cook tent first , of course , then the mess tent , followed by the menagerie , the sideshow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the lot was pervaded by the aroma of coffee and bacon . There is no miracle to equal the organization of a circus . There was as much for us kids to see as there was at the actual performance . The cooks at work on breakfast . Tne elephants ? helping , pushing , pulling . The dressing tent , where the performers were making ready for the day . Why , one of them might even speak to you or let you run an errand ! For us , the roustabouts were second only to the acrobats in glamour . Bold , reckless pirates they seemed , and with what an awe-inspiring command of the richer , more sulfurous veins of English ! They chewed tobacco , and once in a while , as a joke , one of them would offer a thaw to one of us kids . And once in a while there would be a hero among us who could accept the gift and manage it , and then the joke was on the roustabout , and his pals gave him the laugh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they never seemed to mind us kids getting in their hair . Anybody who loved the circus as much as we did was all right with them . By eight o'clock we had finished carrying water for the elephants and tore home to breakfast . But we did n't dawdle over it . We had to hurry back downtown for the Parade . In the afternoon we went to the Big Show itself ; in the evening , too , if we could wangle it . We felt a trifle superior to the rest of the circusgoers . After all , we had seen it arrive . They had n't . We were insiders . That golden lad in blue tights sailing through the stratosphere from trapeze to trapeze ? why , like as not we had run over to the store that morning to fetch him a package of Sweet Caps . And the blonde princess riding proudly on the white horse ? had n't we mailed a letter for her or got her some aspirin from the drugstore ? We had been backstage . We felt like men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not too blase , you bet , to miss anything that went on in the sawdust ring , or to miss any crackerjack or pink lemonade thoughtfully proffered by our indulgent elders .  |
