Carole Lombard was in a hurry to get home . For days the movies ' best screwball comedienne had been traveling crosscountry patriotically , plugging defense bonds . In Indianapolis she had lent a hand at flag-raisings , jampacked the city 's big Cadle Tabernacle for a rally , where she led The Star-Spangled Banner . The blonde actress-who had often said she was glad she was not beautiful-in one day raised $2,000,000 . Indianapolis called her Defense Bond Saleslady No. 1 . Said plain-spoken Miss Lombard : " I 'm like the barker at a carnival . " <P> It was after 4 a.m. when she reached the airport with her mother , Mrs. Elizabeth Peters , and stocky , well-liked Press-agent Otto Winkler . They were tired . There were no sleeping accommodations on T.W.A. 's Flight 3 , due shortly on its way to Los Angeles . Winkler wanted to go to a hotel , sleep , take a train . Miss Lombard vetoed the idea , saying " I 'll curl up and take a pill and pff I 'll be asleep . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , into a bright Midwestern dawn . At Albuquerque , N.Mex. , room had to be found for 15 officers and men of the Army ferry command , returning to their Coast base . Four passengers gave up their seats : one was Violinist Joseph Szigeti . <P> In twilight the plane reached Las Vegas , took off again at 7:07 p.m. for the last lap . At the controls was 12,000-hour veteran Pilot Wayne C. Williams . <P> At 7:30 miners in Nevada 's mountains , some 30 miles southwest of Las Vegas , heard a terrific explosion , saw a vivid flash near the top of Table Rock Mountain . <P> Flames shot up from the lonely peak , then faded . Searching parties started out over snow that bogged horses belly-deep . Men toiled up over flinty rock that shredded boots into uselessness , struggled vertically up through some of the most difficult , barren rockland in the U.S. <P> From Los Angeles flew Husband Clark Gable . He reached Las Vegas , sleepless , waited . Breaking away from friends , he tried to scale the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haggard , unshaven , weary . Some 14 hours after their start , climbers reached the wreckage . <P> Mangled and burned were Miss Lombard , the other three civilian passengers , the 15 Army flyers , the crew of three . The transport had smacked straight into the mountain 's steep wall , only 200 feet below the peak , then had slid , broken , into a ravine . For yards around , the scattered pine trees were scarred , the snow melted clean away . Why the plane had crashed , nobody yet knew .
