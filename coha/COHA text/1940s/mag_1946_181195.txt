The U.N . ' s General Assembly opened this week on the World 's Fair site at Flushing , N. Y. , with Harry Truman on hand to give it a Missouri-style pat on the back . The organizational matters which the Assembly will discuss at this session will collapse like cardboard if the fundamental disputes between East and West are not settled . Men of good will could only hope that the framework of the U.N . would be strengthened by the time peace is delivered . <P> On the eve of the opening , the following was noteworthy : <P> New York City 's Acting Mayor Vincent R. Impellitteri presented to the U.N . ' s big , bluff Secretary General Trygve Lie an enormous gilt key to the New York City building on the Fairgrounds . Mr. Impellitteri and Park Commissioner Robert Moses also made a formal offer to give the U.N . the 350 acres of Flushing Meadow Park , if the U.N . would choose it as a permanent site .

A woman , who probably remembered a cloak- &-dagger; film called The House on 92nd Street ( four blocks north ) , expressed audible worry lest the Russians fabricate atomic bombs in the basement . The Argentine envoys , who arrived early and ensconced themselves at the Waldorf-Astoria , excited the envy of other Latin American delegations unable to find lodgings on Park Avenue . The British were at Essex House , handy for early-morning constitutionals in Central Park . The Liberian delegation found the color line nonexistent at Brooklyn 's elegant St. George . The astonishingly anonymous-looking U.S. delegation ( see cut ) had a whole floor at the Pennsylvania . Senator Connally , with more than 150 other westbound diplomats , was on the Queen Elizabeth , making its first peacetime voyage ( see BUSINESS ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was V. M. Molotov , who was usually surrounded by aides and bodyguards . Both Molotov and Vishinsky bowed deeply whenever they encountered Czechoslovakia 's Jan Masaryk . Masaryk was seen reading a detective novel called Uneasy Terms .
