The war , which has compelled U.S. farmers to look for manpower substitutes , is mothering some amazing new farm machines . So says FORTUNE for September in a survey of new farm machinery that may revolutionize U.S. postwar agriculture . Some of FORTUNE 'S findings : &gt; An enclosed tractor cab with self-starter , heater , cigar lighter , windshield wiper and radio . The manufacturer now plans to air-condition the cab , so that a farmer may " spread manure on frozen January fields while listening to the Aladdin Lamp program in a cab set at a steady 72 , or ride through 130 Kansas heat without raising a drop of sweat . " <P> &gt; A rotary tiller which , avoiding the ruinous , soil-destroying effects of the moldboard plow ( TIME , July 26 ) , chops , harrows and disks the ground . <P> &gt; A small , hand-steered garden tractor , behind which the operator walks , lawn-mower-style , for intensive cultivation . <P> &gt; A sugar-beet harvester that tops the beets , lifts them , shakes the dirt off , drops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a windrow . It makes beet-picking so much cheaper that it may end the long fight over the sugar-beet tariff . <P> &gt; A new , versatile small combine ( " most useful war tool in the U.S. " ) that can harvest more than 100 different crops . With this and other new cheap machinery , FORTUNE believes the small farmer will be able to hold his own with the big farmer after the war . <P> &gt; Equipment companies are not yet making what farmers consider the most essential postwar unit of all : a farm passenger car . What farmers want is " a decent-looking vehicle " that can double as a " sparking " place for the young folks and a light truck for transporting eggs , milk , etc.
