U.S. bluejackets and leathernecks pouring ashore at Reykjavik last week looked over the possibilities of Iceland-as a place to live and a place to defend . <P> The boys ashore soon found their way to Reykjavik 's only cinema and saw Golden Boy . They went to the music halls and saw very proper classical shows . Despite tight restrictions on liquor sales , they managed to find a nip here &; there . They wandered into shops and had a fine time trying to make the shopkeepers ( who had learned the broad English words of the British ) catch onto the American twang . <P> They buddied up to British soldiers and learned some of the Island 's lore . They learned that fire has had more to do with the volcanic island 's look than the ice for which it is named . That Reyk means smoke and Reykjavik is " the smoking harbor . " That Mount Hekla was considered by medieval Icelandic monks the entrance into Hell . That the poetic Icelanders have named their rocks and rills Waterfall of the Gods and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans also learned that the winters are n't so cold and the defenses are n't so hot . Even though Iceland is tangent to the Arctic Circle , its air is warmed by the Gulf Stream , its houses by water piped from its many hot springs . The best natural element of defense is Lake Thingvalla , which , because it is fed by these hot springs , never freezes , and is therefore ideal for flying patrol boats . Otherwise the advantages of the natural defenses are offset by the scarcity of roads and materiel-scarcities which the Yanks knew their Army would not be able to alleviate too soon . <P> Iceland has half a dozen possible airfields , and more could be made on the flat south-coastal plains-if there are planes to put on them . Reykjavik is the only good harbor ; though lots of little boats can huddle in the fiords by the herring ports on the north shore . <P> Last week Winston Churchill said that the British-Canadian forces would not be removed . Presumably the U.S. will soon begin to convoy to Reykjavik . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods the rest of the way to Britain . If this takes place it will enable the British to concentrate their convoy vessels on the last leg of the haul . The inevitable result : much lower mortality among British merchantmen , much higher mortality among U-boats . Add to this the fact that Reykjavik can now serve as a base for U.S. naval patrols , particularly air patrols , as far as the coast of Norway , and the U.S. occupation of Iceland may eventually prove to be a turning point in the Battle of the Atlantic .
