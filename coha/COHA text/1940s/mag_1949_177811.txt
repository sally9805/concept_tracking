Two years ago , realizing its hot and violent dream of freedom , India formally broke away from the British Raj . More than once since then it had seemed as if the great subcontinent would consume itself in war ; by this summer , India gave the greatest promise of stability in Red-flooded Asia . But that stability was far from secure . From New Delhi , TIME correspondent Robert Lubar cabled : <P> India celebrated the anniversary of independence by announcing new and stricter austerity measures . India is still basically a hungry land ; the government has launched a drive to raise more food . To highlight the food drive , plows ripped through New Delhi 's viceregal golf course . Governor General Chakravarti Rajagopalachari , no golfer himself , posed behind a team of bullocks . <P> Commander in chief of the food drive , as he is of the government 's many other battles , was Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru . Together with his deputy , Vallabhbhai Patel , Nehru pulled India through the first two years of independence . During Independence Week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every morning on the deliberations of the Indian constituent assembly , daily attended a dozen , cocktail parties , nightly put in long hours briefing himself on the affairs of his ministries . Beneath his exuberant activity , however , Nehru was a worried man coming face to face with ominous realities . <P> Demand for Work . India 's cities teemed with unemployed , her factories were producing less steel , less cotton cloth and less jute than before independence . Prices were three times as high as in 1939 . Last year India imported 2,200,000,000 rupees ( $665 million ) more than she exported ; she was deep in debt for the balance . Said Nehru in his Independence Day message : " Criticism and self-criticism are always welcome provided they do not take the place of work . Today , India demands work from her children . " <P> But India 's children were also demanding leadership from their paternalistic ruler . Nehru 's Congress Party . That great instrument of India 's will to independence , its mission accomplished , was declining into flabby politics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any other country in Asia , still has no effective parliamentary machinery through which a healthy opposition can work . The Congress Party has power without purpose ; led by a laborite ( Nehru ) and a conservative ( Patel ) , it has avoided charting a clear economic course for India toward either socialism or free enterprise . Nehru last week declared that there would be no nationalization of ker industries for at least ten years ; businessmen were far from reassured .
