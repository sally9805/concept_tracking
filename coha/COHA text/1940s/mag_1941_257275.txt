Big , easygoing Patrolman Stanley Westgate found his good nature and his 190 Ib. sorely tried when he was assigned to Detroit 's tough East Side several years ago . Citizens thereabouts do n't like cops . One night six men gave him clubs up an alley . Later three men slugged him from behind ; later still , a tough cabbie lead-hosed him when he poked his face in the cab . <P> Enough was enough for Officer Westgate . He took up the study of jujitsu . By the time he 'd perfected 104 grips he was transferred to a dark river front beat , even tougher . Hooligans learned to respect the man who whirled them casually about his head , crashed them to the pavement , piled them neatly under his knee . Officer Westgate , a thoughtful man , decided that women , too , should be able to protect themselves ; specifically that his wife Violet ( weight , 114 Ib. ) should be able to repel mashers . " No , " said Violet , " I 'd rather scream . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flipping her headlong across the room . " See how easy it is ? I 'll have no thug beating up my missus . " Violet agreed to learn four holds , no more . They studied together , became adept . Interest in the Westgates ' ability grew ; week ago the Detroit police gave a demonstration before a crowd in the city 's Masonic Temple . Finale was the Westgate act , entitled : " A Woman Defends Herself . " <P> The officer throttled his little wife viciously ; she pinned his ears to the floor . He came back kicking and swinging ; she treated him to a shoulder shrug , a slight wrist twist and a hip flip . Westgate sailed through the air . " Ooooo , " said the audience . Detroit 's toughest cop was taken to the hospital with a broken leg and twisted tendons . Said his remorseful wife : " I never wanted to learn those tricks . . . . I feel trembly and just awful . . . . I 've never hurt him before . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that big hall . "
