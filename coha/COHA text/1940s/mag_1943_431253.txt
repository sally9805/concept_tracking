 | How We Live in France Condensed from Vogue Elizabeth Hoyt 5 he following letter was recently received by the wife of a prominent New York industrialist from her sister , an American who has lived in France for the past 40 years . DEAR SISTER : You ask me what life is like in the France you used to know . The first thing you would notice is that everyone has taken to bicycling . There are no private cars , no taxis , few tramcars and no buses except on a few interurban routes . In baskets mounted in front and in back of the bicycles one carries babies , dogs or just the daily gleanings from long hours of waiting in shops and markets . The sex of the bicycle rarely matches that of the rider . Large people ride small bicycles and small people ride large ones , just as in the old days every Frenchman looked as though he were wearing some other Frenchman 's hat . A woman is permitted to wear slacks while riding her bicycle or walking beside it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arrest for impersonating a man . Your bicycle goes everywhere with you ? on the back of the tramcar , and down to the cellar or up into your apartment when you get home . You practically take it to bed with you . Movie theaters , hotels and stores have parking places with guards , for bicycles are stolen if abandoned for a moment . There are bicycle taxis , too ? trailers pulled by two men on bicycles in parallel or in tandem . One trailer r rode in was pulled a la rickshaw by a man on foot . It was marked " Service Rapide " ! The few interurban buses are operated by a gas made from coke , and they smell to heaven . Trying to find a scat is hopeless . However , bus etiquette requires that all seated passengers must take on their knees all packages , baskets , bags , babies and dogs of standing passengers . All life in France centers around the rationing restrictions . We are conscious of little else . Everything is rationed , and the allowances are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplement them from the " black markets , " despite their exorbitant prices and the danger of heavy fines.  | The stores and markets are full of Gestapo and special police agents , spying on the tradesmen and customers , and also on each other . Every fishing boat is inspected by police agents the minute it reaches port . The agents in uniform spy on the fisherman to see that he does not retain more than the one-pound allotment for each member of his family ; and the police in plain clothes spy on the uniformed police to see that they do n't shake down the fishermen for a supply of fish for themselves . German police are everywhere . The average monthly ration for an adult works out about like this : 16 ounces ( about a pint ) of cooking oil , 6 ounces of a watery , greasy liquid used for salad oil , 7 ounces of oleomargarine , z I z pounds of meat in-cliding bone or fat , 8 ounces of imitation coffee , 35 ounces of sugar , 15 ounces of noodles or macaroni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches long , two inches high , and three inches thick ) , 15 ounces of dried vegetables , 4 ounces of jam , 36 ounces of potatoes , 15 pounds of bread , one egg , four bottles of wine . All this amounts to less than one pound of food per day . Having gotten your ration book entitling you to these allowances , your work is just begun , for there is no certainty that you will find the items or quantities to which you are entitled . First you stand in line to get your ration tickets . Then you stand in another line to get these " inscribed " and obtain buyers ' cards . Next you again stand in line at one market after another until the salesman serves you and , after checking to see that your monthly allowance is not exceeded , stamps on your card the exact amount of each item and the date . A large part of your morning is now gone and the chances arc that you have n't yet found all that you need . If you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is worth the effort because frequently it has fresh vegetables instead of dried . Where is a risk , however , for if the police stop you and find you " transporting vegetables " you are fined . For months during the first winter of German occupation I did not see a single potato or fresh vegetable in the markets . As a substitute the Germans provided rutabaga . If you had a fairly successful marketing day you will arrive home with a few string beans , a small quantity of gritty jam , some bread but no butter . Imitation coffee has little resemblance to coffee except the color . In the bag , the bottom layer is dust , the second is ground barley , and on top are a few coffee beans . You keep the grounds for weeks and boil and reboil them with the fresh imitation coffee . Sugar is beige-colored crystals which never completely dissolve . Bread is grayish brown , heavy , hard , and contains splinters or straw . It always tastes musty and produces  | colic . But it is marvelous currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or almost anything else . For in francs ' worth of bread you can get 30 francs ' worth of other things . The one egg we are allotted each month is rarely obtainable in the shops , and if bought in the black market it costs the equivalent of 5o cents . The hens are so poorly nourished they wo n't lay . I know a priest in a village near Cannes who will perform the marriage ceremony only for eggs , and refuses to accept money . The ration on bread and sugar breaks up friendships , engendering hate or suspicion even in families . Each person consequently keeps his own ticket under lock and key . An industrialist told me that he never before employed so many men , and that they receive higher wages than ever , but that they were never so discontented , because the four things that the French workman requires to keep him happy ? bread , cheese , wine and cigarettes ? arc all scarce and unpalatable . Increases in wages mean nothing , for money is of no use when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is liquid heartburn . Most of the good wine is taken by the Germans . Four liters of wine a month means little to a French workman who was accustomed to a liter with each meal . His cigarette ration is six packages a month , made of low-grade tobacco . Women get none . Tobacco is sold at seven francs per package . Nonsmokers sell theirs for 70 francs to bartenders and waiters who resell them for too francs Everyone has a butt box at home the butts later being broken up and rolled into cigarettes ; the remainder of these are similarly treated , which makes fairly good emergency smoking up to the third or fourth generation . To a woman , clothing restriction are as important as food restrictions . The rations are so meager that it is impossible to dress comfortably without recourse to black markets at enormous prices . The ration units for clothing are known as points and each person is allotted 40 points for a year 's purchases . An artificial-silk skirt of mine required 12 points , an artificial-silk blouse 6 points , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than six months ' points ! Material is high ; a yard of woolen goods requires 2o points . My prewar wardrobe has gradually been worn to shreds , and I resort to all sorts of schemes to provide something new . One expedient was to take two well-worn woolen dresses to a store and offer in a whisper to the floorwalker to exchange these , with a few points to boot , for some dress material . After waiting endlessly for an appraisal of the old gowns and much entering of data in record books , I walked out with four yards of a brown material resembling wool but actually made of wood fiber . It did n't cut well and was difficult to sew , but I finally achieved a dress .  | Snaps and zippers being unobtainable , I cut them from old dresses . A real leather belt found in a black market completed the costume . When I was desperate for a warm suit , the former captain of my sloop said he had some extra points but could buy only men 's clothing with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wool pants , and from those I made a tailored suit for myself . The only shoes readily obtainable have wooden soles with little horseshoes of fiber nailed to them to deaden the clatter . The more expensive designs have hinges in the soles , which make walking more comfortable . With so much walking to be done , and with the chilblains that develop as soon as winter approaches , all walking is an ordeal . Chilblains are a national affliction now that there is no central heating and no running hot water . It is difficult to heat water , since gas and electricity are sharply rationed . Dishes and laundry are therefore washed in cold water . In winter your hands are swollen , purple , painful and frequently infected . Other infections , particularly those of glandular origin , result from the lack of nutritious foods , and liver trouble is widespread . Last winter a minor operation was performed on my leg . To avoid catching cold I went through the operation bundled up in my fur coat . I returned to the hospital daily to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the wound was changed . The rest of the dressings and bandages served for several weeks , and after my wound healed these had to be returned to the hospital so that they could be used again on someone else . Doctors are scarce and medicines scarcer . A doctor will frequently give three different prescriptions , hoping you can get one of them filled . Owing to lack of transportation , doctors will come to your home only in extreme cases . Dentists are as rare as doctors , and since dental gold is unobtainable , the patient is required to contribute a ring or other piece of jewelry from which the necessary metal is taken . When a woman 's smile reveals considerable gold , the inference is that she has contributed her wedding ring for the dental work , and one says , " You see ? she 's married ! " People can find some way of keeping body and soul together , but animals are indeed pathetic . They are disappearing fast . Horses can not be properly fed and are consequently swollen , emaciated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ span of working years is completed . Cats are scarce because they can not be fed and perhaps because they resemble rabbits when cooked . The law forbids giving even a stale morsel of bread to a stray animal , but for homeless dogs I make a soup of vegetable parings and bread , placing it outside at night and recovering the dish early in the morning . Social life is practically extinct be-  | cause we ca n't procure the makings of cocktail parties and dinner parties are too difficult . If friends do ask you to dinner you bring some article of food and give one ration card point for the grease to cook with . Unless these food contributions mix readily they have to be cooked separately , which uses up gas and cooking fats . Guests often fail to bring their ration tickets , and this leads to strained friendships . Sometimes guests bring restaurant meals to the dinner party . On occasions when the Germans forbid circulation in the streets from 5 p.m. to 5 a.m. , your dinner guests stay all night . We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course ) . Conversation is exclusively on food and clothing , with little mention of politics , for everyone has the feeling that nothing can be done until outside help comes . Collaborationists are shunned , yet we know that most of them are merely giving lip service to obtain personal privileges , such as access to black markets run by the Germans or gifts of fuel . In my entire acquaintance , which is wide and varied after 40 years France , I know few persons who d not deeply detest the Germans . Efforts were made by the government under German direction , to turn this hatred into resentment against the former government leaders who brought France into the war unprepared , but success in this was shortlived . Resentment is concentrate on Germany and all things German . Right now I am going to take a soapless bath , drawn from the cold-water tap , dab my face with home-made cold cream ( fish oil and beeswax ) , rub it off with the paper napkin I conserved from my restaurant luncheon for this or for baseruses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( but washed and sterilized ) , and then crawl between my sandpaper cotton-duck sheets . Life is just one dull period of waiting in this cemetery that was France . One can have no desires , ambitions or aspirations beyond the daily means of living . But in the hearts of all whom I know burns always the same smoldering hope ? Deliverance .
