Into a pot bubbling with all sorts of complex plans for postwar Europe , Belgium 's exiled Premier Hubert Pierlot last week tossed a proposition as calm as it was simple . His proposition : that Belgium take up where she left off in 1940 , with King Leopold on the throne , the prewar Parliament in its seats , the exiled Cabinet in power until it " renders account " and prepares the country for postwar elections . <P> " Then , " said Pierlot , " we will resign . " <P> Such a program will probably be more practicable for Belgium than for most of Europe . Since the day the Nazis immured him in Laeken Castle , 42-year-old King Leopold has kept his title but has refused to govern . Belgian courts have stubbornly refused to cater to the Nazis , and have kept the prewar judicial system pretty well intact ( TIME , Jan. 25 , 1943 ) . Nazi exploitation and expropriation have presumably played havoc with Belgium 's interior economy , left the true ownership of many properties in doubt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe-did not seem to worry Premier Pierlot . Comfortably , he recalled that Belgium still has her rich African Congo , now aboom with wartime demands for its rubber and minerals .
