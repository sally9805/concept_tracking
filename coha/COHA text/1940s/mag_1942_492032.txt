THE Boxer Rebellion ended . The empress dowager bought peace from the eight foreign powers with a $300,000,000 indemnity and further " concessions . " The white devils had triumphed , but Homer Lea , the hunchbacked little American " general " without an army , was fleeing to Hong Kong , disguised as a French missionary , and hunted every mile by the empress ' agents . In Hong Kong , a Chinese fellow student at Stanford took him in , and one day told Lea he must meet a " certain man " who realized China never could be reformed from the top down . This " certain man " was a foreign-educated Christian Chinese medical student , ten years Lea 's senior , Lea 's host explained . He headed an even more powerful Masonic society than the Po-Wong-Wui , one which numbered thousands of fanatic members throughout China , working ceaselessly for the hour of revolution . Its password was " thumbs up . " In his turgid Chinese novel , The Vermilion Pencil , Lea wrote : " The call to battle is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know of nothing more terrifying than this pointing up of thumbs to heaven . " The " certain man " was Sun Yat-sen , known now to the world as the George Washington of China . Doctor Sun , in his autobiography , describes that first meeting with Lea at Canton : It was now that another important event happened to me . I was speaking to a company of my fellows when my eye fell on a young man of slight physique . . . . His face was pale . . . . Afterward he came to me and said : " I would like to throw in my lot with you . I believe your ideas will succeed . . . . " He held out his hand . I took it and thanked him , wondering who he was . I thought he was a missionary student . After he had gone , I asked , " Who was that little hunchback ? " " That , " said the man who brought him , " is Homer Lea , one of the most brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is a perfect master of modern warfare . " I almost gasped in astonishment . " And he has offered to throw in his lot with me ! " . . The next morning I called on Homer Lea . I told him , in case I should succeed and my countrymen gave me the power to do no , I would make him my chief military adviser . " Make me that now , " Lea said , " and you will succeed . " At twenty-four Homer Lea became Sun 's chief of staff . But the hour had not come for either man . The empress dowager , humiliated by the triumphant white powers , redoubled her persecution of her own progressive country-men . Together , Sun and Lea fled to Japan . There they spent several months trying to persuade the 27 " Westernized " Japanese government to give political and financial backing to Sun 's party . Everywhere in high places they met with evasions ; it was the policy of a modernized Japan to keep its neighbor , China , weak , backward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day came . In 1901 , two years after the unknown little Stanford student left home , he returned to Los Angeles in the exotic uniform of a Chinese general . His friends were a little embarrassed . And his " round , unvarnished tales " of his Oriental adventures seemed to their incredulous ears to be pretty heavily covered with an Oriental lacquer . Casual acquaintances and strangers were amused and openly skeptical . Incredulity was tempered when Lea 's home suddenly took on the status of a sort of democratic Chinese White House in exile . Doctor Sun made it his headquarters . Exiled Prime Minister Kong Yu Wei , who at Lea 's persuasion had now thrown in his lot with Sun , arrived at Lea 's door . Kong had prudently brought a fortune with him . Later , aristocratic Liang Ki Chew , even more in funds , took up his abode with the cripple . All of them firmly referred all reporters to " the general . " Lea began again to raise an army . He lectured and taught a group of Chinese students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others in the canyons behind Santa Monica and on the outskirts of San Francisco . Ansel O'Banion , a tough Irish ex-sergeant of the 4th U. S. Cavalry , whom Lea had run across when O'Banion was captain of the Philippine Constabulary , became the body to Lea 's brain . Big O'Banion " could drill a troop or a tooth , " Lea said , " with equal efficiency . " There was only one thing O'Banion would not do for Lea . At the many Chinese dinners they attended in this organizing period , the sergeant would not eat with chopsticks . After the first few angry attempts , he simply held the bowl to his mouth and , to Lea 's disgust , shoveled in his rice . Some years later , O'Banion went to the penitentiary for smuggling Chinese into California over the Mexican border . His defense , that they were refugees from the tyranny of the Manchus , did not receive the same sympathy a similar defense might in these days . A friend describes one scene of this organizing period . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal speaker , eighty-eight-pound ( Continued on Page 38 ) Homer Lea  --  sitting piggyback on O'Banion'a shoulders in order to dominate his hearers  --  so impassionedly harangued a crowd of 5000 Chinese on the tyranny of the Manchu dowager empress that in the end they all whipped out their pocketknives and , to a man , cut off their queues  --  the immemorial sign of their servitude to the Manchus . In 1904 Lea went back to China , there briefly to take command of the 2nd Army Division . A year later he returned to Santa Monica , older and wiser . China still was not yet ready . Moreover , Lea 's health was worse and his eyes were failing . There was another thing : Lea had begun deeply to worry about his own country . He saw our indifference to the predatory forces at work in the world ; how , more and more , we were mistaking material wealth and prestige for power  --  by which Lea meant simply armed strength and the will to use it . Said he , " Whenever a nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being without military power to defend its opulence and support its arrogance , the hour of its desolation , if not at hand , approaches . . . . " Although wedded , as a born soldier always is , to the theory that the sword is mightier than the pen , Lea was forced to turn to the pen . First limbering the muscles of his mind on a novel , The Vermilion Pencil , a strange and bloody romance of Manchu China , and an unproduced play called The Crimson Spider , he made notes meanwhile for The Valor of Ignorance . Two people helped him  --  the loyal O'Banion and a young Tennessee divorcee , Mrs. Ethel Bryant Powers , who had come to California with her two small sons and sought work as a secretary . As O'Banion was Lea 's body , Mrs. Powers became his eyes . Anticipating a Japanese invasion , Lea set out to explore the California coast . Sometimes riding on a burro , sometimes carried in O'Banion 's arms , he dragged his sick little body up and down the 2400 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ findings on the utter defenselessness of the Pacific coast against the Japanese attack  --  which he carefully plotted for them in the maps which profusely illustrate The Valor of Ignorance  --  were so dire that had a Japanese admiral said , in 1906 , what Admiral Yamamoto said in December , 1941 ? " I am looking forward to dictating peace to the United States in the White House at Washington " ? Lea would have bitterly replied , " And , pray , what 's to stop you ? " Returning from these explorations , he would lie on a blazing Indian rug , in Westlake Park amid the flowers , making his notes , his weak eyes shielded from the sun by a black slouch campaign hat , a military cape with a red satin lining thrown over his shoulders . Later he dictated his text toeMrs.Powers . When the manuscript of The Valor was finished , Lea sent it to General Chaffee for criticism . Chaffee came at once to see him , and brought Major General Story . Chaffee said : " I have not been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " There is no flaw in it . " When the book finally appeared , in 1909 , under the Harper imprint , it caused a passing furor . Pacifist and international peace movements denounced it . Had they known the words in 1909 , his critics would have called Lea a Fascist and a Totalitarian . In Lea 's doubt of " naturalized Americans , " his bias in favor of Anglo-Saxon racial and intellectual superiority , his frank predictions of wars between the races , his dread of the " Russian Octopus , " today 's critics may still find reasons for calling him America 's " First Fascist . " Lea was neither a Fascist nor a Totalitarian . He was first a militarist . All militarists seem to the civilian mind somewhat Fascist because they " believe in force . " Few civilians realize the extent to which most militarists favor strong unapplied force , which is peace , over applied force , which is war . Secondly , Lea , the hunchback , was a thwarted soldier . One sometimes suspects that he lost his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all possibility of his helping to win them on the battlefield . But thirdly and most important , Lea was a patriot . He deliberately propounded a philosophy of defeat in order to challenge the victorious spirit of America . Time and time again , in his harsh reasoning , he stepped over the mark in order to force his countrymen , " slothful with fat pride , " to toe it . America 's Deaf Ears Now Lea 's old enemy , David Starr Jordan , missed no opportunity in print to quarrel with its thesis . When Valor appeared , he wrote to " Dear Mr.Lea " : . . . the matter of peace has very little to do with military experts . If a great nation like this decides it will live in peace ... it will be let alone by other countries . . . . So far as Japan is concerned , there is no likelihood , unless we flaunt the red rag for years , that any thought of . . ? war will arise among her statesmen . Wars are mostly started by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by yellow journals . . . . Japan staggers under . , approaching bankruptcy . . . on the whole , it would be better for any nation to be thrashed and pass over temporarily into control of another nation than to continue the monstrous expenditures now going on in England and Germany . . Note that Doctor Jordan was arguing thirty-three years ago that Japan was bankrupt ? It has a familiar sound . The literary critics were apathetic or skeptical . " Entertaining reading , " said the December , 1909 , American Magazine . " Written in an amazingly hifalutin style , bristling with historical generalizations , " said the Independent , rating it a " minus . " The Literary Digest , then in its heyday , called it " a daring and startling book . . . which every American would do well to ponder . " For a while many Americans did ponder Lea 's book . Hearst seized upon The Valor of Ignorance , reworking its thesis into circulation-getting yellow journalism , in behalf of his " Yellow Peril " campaign . Lea thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it is all coming true " only thirty-three years later would not have astonished him . Hearst 's shrill headlines implied that Lea 's JapAmerican war would break in months . When it did n't , the public grew bored both with Lea and with Hearst 's Yellow Peril . Having sold 18,000 copies , The Valor of Ignorance went out of print altogether in 1922 ? just about the time Japan began to fortify the islands around Wake and Guam which she had picked up from Germany at Versailles . But if the public dismissed him and litterateurs disdained him , Lea could despise them , for he began to receive letters from important military men the world over , and even from a few statesmen . The Japanese militarists paid him a greater compliment . In Japan , The Valor of Ignorance went into twenty-four editions in one month . The blurb on the jacket of the popular edition read , " Excellent reading matter for all Oriental men with red blood in their veins . " The Japanese government made it required reading for officers in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The King of Italy sent a personally annotated copy to his chief of staff . Strangest compliment of all was paid to Lea twenty-odd years later by a man called Adolf Hitler . Given a copy , no doubt , by " geopolitical " Professor Haushofer , he cribbed several paragraphs on the apparent inability of the democratic form of government to defend itself in time , and inserted them in a book which he was then writing in jail , called Mein Kampf . Field Marshal Lord Roberts invited the young apostle of war to come to London to consult with him on the defense of the Empire . Roberts wrote in longhand : . . . when I read it I could not rest until I had finished it . So struck was I with your description of the unpreparedness . . . of the people in America with that of my own people , that my first thought was to get lyour book very generally read here . . . . I found that Harper 's had only some half dozen copies . . . I carried off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cable for more . . . . During the years that preceded the outbreak of World War I , the field marshal 's efforts to warn the British people had earned him the title of warmonger . Flattered as he was , Lea refused " Bobs ' " invitation . First , his health did not permit . Second , he was , for the moment , too contented . These had been happy days ; he was surrounded by old friends and a few admiring new ones . Charles E. Van Loan , George Herriman  --  creator of Krazy Kat  --  and Ambrose Bierce were among a company which included Chinese princes and revolutionaries . And there was Mrs. Powers , who now never left her invalid 's side . Ji Philippine Prophecy Mrs. Powers spent the afternoons reading to him aloud , volumes of history , travel , Napoleonic and political memoirs . Sometimes he got a little drunk ; though generally , stepson Joshua Bryant Powers , now a New York publisher 's agent , reported , he was really drunk on his own talk . His bombastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge of his military dicta . His friend , Harry Carr , tells of a conversation between Lea and a cocky cavalry major who had served in the Philippines . The cavalryman had presumed to dispute Lea 's thesis that the islands could not be held . Lea turned on him , " I am , as you know , a consulting strategist . In the event of war , I will pick out a post for you . " He jabbed his long forefingerinto the officer 's chest . " You shall be a mule driver . But do n't try to lead the mules . Just pick out a mule somewhere in the middle of the pack train  --  and leave all decisions to the mule . " Lord Roberts continued to press Lea , even offering to send his own physician to accompany him on the voyage . And then , when Lea received a personal invitation from Kaiser Wilhelm II to witness the German war maneuvers , he could no longer resist . So that Mrs. Powers might share the triumphs which her collaboration had made possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accompanied by ex-Prime Minister Kong Yu Wei , sailed for Europe in the spring of 1910 . The German Character In a full-dress uniform  --  probably of his own imaginative designing  --  he watched the German maneuvers from a carriage with high cushions , which the Kaiser  --  himself a cripple , with his shriveled arm  --  had especially ordered . All political and military doors in Germany were automatically opened to the general who had never been asked to enter the doors of the White House or  --  as he would dearly have preferred  --  those of West Point . In spite of this attention  --  or perhaps because of it  --  Lea 's estimate of the essential German character remained objective . In The Day of the Saxon he wrote : The fundamental error in the English conception of German expansion is the belief that it results from some transient plan , the conception of an individual finding a momentary response in the German people . Conditions , and not individuals , determine national expansion . Individuals , and not conditions , determine the manner and degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lifetime of an individual whose genius grasps their significance and whose position in the state permits him to make use of his discernment , then occur those tragic epochs in national life when out of the wreckage of one state another is created . Such was the combination between Peter and Russia , Napoleon and France , Bismarck and Germany . To this combination , the genius of such men is its soul . Ordinarily this soul is transient . In Germany it is otherwise . . . . On the one hand ' Great Britainl we find a bewildered race led hither and thither through labyrinthine ways ; on the other , a military power in which neither theories nor sophistry find a place , but where the intentness of its aims knows no discouragement . . . the movement of such a nation resembles that of fate in the certitude of its progression . The noise of its approach tallies the destiny of many states . It is difficult for the Saxon to understand that German expansion is not circumscribed by the European continent , but is determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the fact that natural obstacles such as oceans , great distances by land , or unfavorable climatic conditions no longer limit the conquest of nations . Prussian troops can now be moved to the ends of the strategic world in less time than a hundred years ago they could go from Berlin to Paris . Owing to this elimination of space and time , while the geographical , political and racial segregation of the balance of nations remains constant , Germany could , subsequent to the destruction of the British Empire , control her portion of the world with no greater difficulty than did Napoleon at one time direct the affairs of Europe . . . In neither the hate nor greed nor insolence of the Teutonic race is to be found the impulse of its expansion . . . this propulsion comes from necessity . Necessity is a racial god . . . . Bismarck and the factories of Germany have again called down this god . That German expansion must of necessity result in a struggle with the Saxon race is not due to Bismarck , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saxon and Saxon activity . German expansion is only brought in conflict with those nations whose territories and suzerainty barricade its progression . And in proportion as they block Teutonic power , to the same degree are German energies directed toward the destruction of British power . . . . In London , all through the late summer and early autumn of 1911 , Lea consulted daily with Roberts on plans for the prevention of the invasion of England . His military findings in The Day of the Saxon hold as good for this war as they did for the war that broke three years later upon an astonished England . Germany 's failure in 1914 to follow Lea 's plan of the conquest of Denmark and Holland first may have cost them that war . Even in 1911 he wrote that " only by the invasion and investment of the British Isles themselves can Germany hope to destroy the Empire . " And in 1911 he warned Germany against an attack on Russia : " A war between Russia and Germany , while resulting disastrously to the defeated nation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commensurate with its expenditures . . . . But the dismemberment of the British Empire , on the other hand , will result most advantageously to Germany , Russia and Japan . " In London , Lea began to make notes for a third book , intended to complete his military trilogy . He called it The Swarming of the Slay . In the end , Lea believed , after a period of Napoleonic wars betweenBritain , Germany , Amer-ice and Japan was done , the greatest and last war of the United States and Great Britain would come  --  their war against Russia . We have heretofore called attention to a strange fatality that , from time to time , seizes hold upon all nations , and in numerous instances is the indirect cause that leads to their final dissolution . This characteristic is concentrating the entire attention of the nation against one enemy , while the movement against its other frontiers by an equally dangerous foe remains unchecked . This has never been more completely exemplified than by the British nation . In its fear of German conquest it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of the Empire which , if once seized , destroys it more effectually than the German invasion of England . . . the development of the Russian Empire . . . has most nearly approached those characteristics that mark the measured , unhurried growth of Nature . In its extension it has moved onward with elemental propulsion . Like a glacier , its movement is only apparent by periods of time . So imperceptible is the terrible , imperturbable grind of its way that we do not perceive its progress until it has passed a given point . What it does not crush , iterodes . What it does not erode , it forces on in front until into some crevasse , great or small , it pushes the debris that impedes its way .... At the beginning of the eighteenth century Russia was less than two hundred and seventy-five thousand square miles . In seven generations it increased until it comprised nearly nine millions , or one seventh of the land surface of the world . During the same period its population increased from twelve millions to more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of increase , by propagation alone , it will exceed four hundred millions in three generations . . . During these two centuries twenty-one wars were fought for the expansion of the empire , lasting for one hundred and one years . To secure the Baltic it was necessary to sacrifice 700,000 men of 1,800,000 put into the field ; to gain the Black Sea 760,000 perished out of 3,200,000 . Russia in her progress is concerned no more with the devastation of her wars than is Russian nature with the havoc of her winters . Should the dissolution of Saxon power originate in the conquest of India by Rus sia , or through the supremacy of Japan in the Pacific , or by the invasion of the United Kingdom by Germany , the result is the same as if these activities were predetermined by the three nations and were simultaneous in their occurrence . To Japan ? would go the predominance of the Pacific Ocean and its islands ; to Russia that of the Southern Asian continent and the Indian Ocean ; to Germany that of Western and Southern Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saxon race , because of the supremacy of individual ideals over those belonging to the nation or race , has become ignorant of the effects of racial unity and national cohesion . tIn our ) period the Russian Empire draws to a close . It approaches the Empire of the World . From Chinese agents in London , in the early winter of 1911 , Lea received a great piece of news . The Sun Yat-sen movement , so long a disastrous series of sporadic mob outbursts in the provinces , had begun to assume true revolutionary proportions . Lea decided that at long last the day had arrived . Over the protests of his doctor , who warned him that this voyage must cost him his life , Lea sailed for Shanghai from Marseilles with Doctor Sun , who had come fromAmerice to join him . On the thirty-day voyage , the Californian finished The Day of the Saxon , while Doctor Sun wrote the outlines of his " three people 's principles , " expressed by Abraham Lincoln as " government of the people , by the people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a palanquin , did lead in army of the republic to victory . The crippled American boy at long last made good his cool boast " to topple the Manchus from their Dragon Throne . " The rest is history . In Nanking , in 1911 , Gen. Homer Lea saw Sun Yat-sen elected president of the Chinese Republic , while a " foreign-fashion " band played See the Conqu'ring Hero Comes . He was the only white man present at the formal birth of a democracy of four hundred and fifty million people . At the presidential reception he congratulated the president , and is supposed to have uttered a strange word of warning , in which he paraphrased his own written words . " Now China , " he said , " is a republic . America , too , is a republic . It was born of the militant patriotism of those who in simple persistent valor laid with their swords the foundations of a national edifice ; who , after seven years of labor , cemented with their own blood the thirteen blocks of its foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserved in its beauty and freedom by vigilant swords . . China 's enemies now are its historic pacifism and political corruption . ? . and Japan . We have the same three enemies . . . . I can do nothing for either of our two great countries . I am a dying man . I have warned America in my books . I now warn you , in words . . . . Free China will yet perish unless there rises from your innermost bosom the militant spirit of another Martial Monk . If he does not come , republic or no , the hour for this ancient kingdom has come . . . Homer Lea had grown too blind , perhaps , to see the face of a young soldier who may have stood by Sun Yat-sen 's side . Or was that young soldier looking raptly on the face of the doctor 's pretty little sister-in-law , Mailing Soong ? At any rate , no one knows whether or not Gen. Homer Lea saw or met that day a young soldier whose name was Chiang Kai-shek . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was carried aboard the Shinyo Maru in a litter , and in May , 1912 , reached California . The Day of the Saxon , " finished on a field of recent battle , " went to his publishers . Lea was far too ill to read the reviews . This was just as well , for the hook which predicted so accurately World Wars I and II was not well received . It sold all together 7000 copies in English , and , in the year Hitler came into power , went out of print and out of mind . In his Santa Monica cottage , on the first day of November of the first year of the Chinese Republic , Little Scrunch-neck died . His poor body was laid out in his resplendent uniform , at its side the long sword , which he had dreamed , as a boy , of wielding brilliantly in his country 's defense , still unstained by any man 's blood .
