Ford Motor Co. called in its regional sales chiefs to Detroit last week to hear news of the company 's postwar plans . The news : Ford will build a new , low-priced car which will be 20 to 25% cheaper than the regular Ford line ( TIME , Oct. 11 , 1943 ) . This is the car which automen have gossiped will be the up-to-date flivver , will sell for $500 . Actually , the company carefully refrained from putting a price on the new car ; it still does not know whether its prewar line will be sold at 1941 prices , or higher . But Ford made clear that , while it tools up for the new car , its first postwar cars will be much-improved 1942 models . ( Said Henry Ford II : " The cars will be more improved over 1942 than the average yearly changes . " ) To produce the postwar flivver and reconvert , Ford will spend $15,000,000.
