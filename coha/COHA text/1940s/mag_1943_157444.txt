England 's 18th Century master of graphic razz and uproar , Caricaturist Thomas Rowlandson , last week enlivened the Boston art scene : some 100 selected Rowlandsons hung on the walls of the Boston Public Library . They came from the Library 's Albert H. Wiggin* Collection of Prints , Drawings , and Books-one of the world 's finest . <P> The Boston Library did not hang some of its more raffish Rowlandson items . But the show contained such characteristic works as At Close Range , a deft landscape containing a stray huntsman spying on a lover 's embrace , and the farcical Pig in a Poke , in which a juicy porker tries to escape pursuing humanity through the heavy legs of an equally porcine woman . <P> Few if any caricaturists have excelled lusty , free-swinging Thomas Rowlandson in the lampooning of social manners . Lacking the brutal bite of Hogarth and Goya , he yet thoroughly impaled many of the affectations and stupidities of his period . Prolific " Rowly " was born in London in 1756 of a prosperous merchant father and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year at the Royal Academy , two years of happy , standard artist 's life in Paris ( bills footed by a rich French aunt ) . <P> Dr. Syntax . In his spare time , Rowlandson became a great London swell . Extra money for gambling debts could the always be leading had print from publisher Rudolph of the Ackermann , time . For Ackermann , Rowlandson illustrated the popular satirical picture book Tour of Dr. Syntax in Search of the Picturesque . ( Today a Rowlandson-illustrated first edition has brought as much as $3,100 from book collectors . ) <P> Writes English Esthete Osbert Sitwell : " The faces he shows us often appear at first sight as the faces of a delirium ; and then , horror on horror , one discovers that they are to be encountered every day in street and newspaper . " <P> * The pre-depression chairman of the Chase National Bank gave the collection to the Library in 1941.
