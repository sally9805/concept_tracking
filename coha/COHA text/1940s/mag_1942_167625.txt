Its name : Chaplain Jim-U.S.A . <P> Five mornings a week ( over the Blue Network ) for the duration , Chaplain Jim is scheduled to bring the everyday problems of Army men home to their mothers , wives and sweethearts . A 15-minute sustaining show , it is being written and produced by Blackett-Sample-Hummert , Inc. , who run the biggest soap-opera factory in the world . <P> Chaplain Jim 's initial episode was tried &; true . Between the sequences of a trite situation , it managed to get over the idea that the boys in the Army ca n't hear from home too often , worry if they do n't . It also offered the reassuring information that the boys can always turn to their chaplain for comfort and guidance . <P> Despite its shallow quality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to womenfolk who are worried about their men in the armed forces .
