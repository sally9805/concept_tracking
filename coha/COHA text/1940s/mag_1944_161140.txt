U.S. cigarets are rapidly disappearing from the Paris black market . Drastic Army rationing ( two packs a week ) has curtailed the black market 's supply , boosted the price to 160 francs ( $3.20 ) a pack . <P> Last week Americans in Paris were imitating frugal Frenchmen who roll their own , getting the makings from old butts . Three butts make a full-sized smoke . A man with only two butts has to adopt another makeshift . He borrows a third from a friend , rolls his cigaret , smokes it , gives the butt back for further use .
