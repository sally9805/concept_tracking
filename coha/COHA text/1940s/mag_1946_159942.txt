The A.F.L. and C.I.O. bumped heads again in runoff elections at the Oak Ridge , Tenn. atomic-energy plants . Both were left groggy ; the collision settled little in their scrap to organize Southern labor . <P> At the biggest plant , Tennessee Eastman , a majority of the workmen voted for no union at all . At the smallest , Monsanto Chemical Co. , the A.F.L. came out on top . At the Carbide &; Carbon Chemicals factory , where the C.I.O. had trailed the A.F.L. in the first election , it now won by a molecule ( 25 votes out of 3,811 cast ) . <P> The switch at Carbide &; Carbon was a minor triumph for the C.I.O. As a last-minute campaign tactic it had accused the A.F.L. of scheming to put Oak Ridge workers into the corrupt and autocratic Hod Carriers Union . An A.F.L. suit for criminal libel was too late to stop the damage . Summed up Southern A.F.L. Representative George Googe : " Chaos for another year . "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
