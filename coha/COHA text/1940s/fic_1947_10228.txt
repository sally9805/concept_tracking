version of Chaplain Bascom . For this grace he importuned every saint in heaven , including his dead mother , who 'd scrubbed floors all her life . Father Donovan bent down and fastened a buckle on his combat boot . He paused to mop his thin pale face . He spied some GI 's sitting at tables on the terrace of an outside bar.  --  In the mood for a cool drink , chaplain ?  --  None of this vino for me , padre . You should take the pledge yourself.  --  And what would I do at morning Mass ? Father Donovan laughed plaintively . They sat at one of the wicker tables under the dome of the Galleria Umberto . All about him Father Donovan spotted GI 's of the 34th who waved to him and went back to their sprawling . He ordered a glass of vermouth for himself and a tumbler of flavored gaseous water for Chaplain Bascom.  --  Our boys must n't think I 'm guzzling , Chaptain Bascom said , holding up his orangeade to show everyone in the Galleria that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  It would only increase their esteem for you , Father Donovan said primly . Now Father Donovan did n't smoke . He always said that the fumes of Chaplain Bascom 's pipe were enough for two . In spite of his wispy body he was in fine condition , and combat had made him like a grasshopper . Chaplain Bascom 's steaky belly had gone down during these two years of Africa and Sicily and Italy when he was n't getting Missus Bascom 's corn bread for supper . Father Donovan used to spend Sunday afternoons in South Philadelphia playing touch football with the kids of his choir  --  after he 'd peeled off his Roman collar and rolled up his cassock till it was a black towel around his waist . Father Donovan loved baseball , candy , and the movies  --  after he 'd assured himself that they 'd been certified by the Legion of Decency.  --  There 's one favor you could do me , chaplain , said Father Donovan , leaning softly over his vermouth . Never in his life had he raised his voice except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anything , the chaplain said , clearing his throat of orangeade with a lordly gargle.  --  Why wo n't you call me Father ? I 'm a priest . Padre sounds likeTeddy Roosevelt .... Oh I know it 's regular army and all that .. .  --  Army Regulations , said Chaplain Bascom , assuming the raptp 101pose with which he ended his prayer meetings , provide that all chaplains , regardless of denomination , shall be addressed as chaplain .. .  --  But they also state that there 's no objection to calling a priest Father . Do n't tell me that at this stage of the game you 're jealous of the prestige and affection in the word Father ?  --  Always a slight chip on your shoulder , Chaplain Bascom said , gathering his weight up behind his orangeade . He smelled brimstone.  --  Just thought I 'd ask , Father Donovan said in his meekest tone which he always lapsed into when piqued . Chaplain Bascom glowered around the Galleria . His veinous porcine eyes stared , as though he were looking for some shrinking GI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All here from South Calina raise their hands . . . . He relit his pipe . Father Donovan , who knew all his moods , waited but said nothing . He looked at the other chaplain 's cap with its gold oak leaf and wondered why all the priests in the army except the chief in Washington seemed to be first lieutenants . Soon Chaplain Bascom would be a lieutenant colonel , at which point he 'd begin to consider himself a staff officer , with command functions . In vain did Father Donovan keep telling himself that he was a priest , commissioned in the army only to keep souls in the way they should go , to give the last rites to the . dying , and to return the living to their dioceses without loss of faith or stain of mortal sin . For sometimes when he was saying his rosary or reading his holy office , he 'd find his fingers straying to his cap and feeling that lone silver bar . It was a sin of vanity . But in his examinations of conscience he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight and appease him . . . . He deserved it . He 'd done just as much work as Chaplain Bascom ... . And Chaplain Bascom , watching his mild friend out of one corner of an eye throbbing with rage , thought : They 're all alike deep down inside . The same who started the Inquisition , the same who held back all scientific progress , the same who still wield a world dictatorship.  --  Look there now , said Chaplain Bascom . Most interesting . . . . An oily Italian priest came cruising into the Galleria in black cassock and brushed round hat . He zoomed among the GI 's like a water bug , wheedling , panhandling , trembling with holy zeal for alms . He had a card in English which he thrust under the faces of the GI's.  |  --  Almost a different church here , Father Donovan said under his breath . The Italian priest arrived over an isolated GI who 'd passed out in his chair . He looked quickly around the Galleria , then bent over the hunched form.  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donovan watched , saying a Hail Mary under his breath , the greasy Italian friar began to pry at a wad of lire and a pack of Luckies protruding from the unbuttoned breast pocket of the GI . Father Donovan leaped from his chair , crossed the Galleria , and barged up to the thieving brother . He did n't know any Italian , but he used the Latin that came into his mind :  --  Hoc est enim corpus meum . Then as a sort of exorcism he shook the silver cross of his collar insignia . The hustling friar , unshaven and smelling of his last meal , whirled about in his cape , gathered it about him with grimy fingers , and went streaking away into the crowds of the Galleria Umberto . Father Donovan woke the sleeping GI gently and returned across the arcade , wondering what in this world or the next he could find to say to Chaplain Bascom in excuse for this most unpleasant incident . Through his mind flashed all the dialectical training of the seminary , long since all but forgotten now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection and choir rehearsal . Father Donovan prayed madly for the gift of tongues , for Jesuitical casuistry to fence off the questions his Baptist friend was preparing for him . Though he seldom did it , except when pounding the chest of a section sergeant who 'd forgotten to make his Easter duty , Father Donovan rallied all his shyness and determined to take the aggressive . After all , the Church was facing a greater opponent than she 'd had at Anzio.  --  Shocking , said Father Donovan , seating himself . Probably not even a priest . Naples is full of them . Impostors .. .  --  Oh , I do n't know , Chaplain Bascom said silkily . Looks kinda like the Good Samaritan rolling the man who lay by the side of the road , do n't it ? Or Christ asking Mary Magdalene for a handout .... You have a very rich church , padre . Money rolls into Rome from all over the world . .. . I think I begin to understand the capitalism of the Roman Church . I 'm only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big political machine do n't pay its expenses on hay . . . . No sireee . Father Donovan felt a white flame of rage rising in him . Then he saw something and said in a choked voice :  |  --  Look ... . Two nuns were entering the Galleria in that way they have of seeming not to walk . No GI yelled at them . Each nun had by the hand two little girls in the chaste black dresses of Neapolitan orphans . The children laughed to one another and to the GI 's . They had the glowing faces of southern Italian babies . The nuns beamed down on them , keeping a firm grip on their small hands . Then Father Donovan thanked Our Lady for answering his prayer.  --  You must consider this side of the question too , he said , relieved.  --  Ah yes , said Chaplain Bascom airily , mother love . . . . How nice to find it even in Naples . It 's the one great constant of our mean little world.  --  But you miss the point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie to those orphans . They function in accordance with the Church 's exalted idea of parenthood , which goes back to Our Blessed Mother . . . . And you Protestants seem almost ashamed to admit that Christ had a mother . You make fun of our devotion to her , as though you were uneasy at the function of the love between man and God .. .  --  It 's a scorcher today , padre , Chaplain Bascom said . He finished his orangeade , fanned himself , and loosened the shirt about his thick neck . Chaplain Bascom brooded sulkily to himself . It was quite clear to him why the Roman Church had failed in the modern world . In a time when men wanted something positive to cling to , she offered them only the lacy traceries of an old theology . The twentieth century was too rapid for arguments on the navel of Adam . Especially Americans . . . they wanted that good solid oldtimereligion , which was precisely what the Baptist Church was giving them . Plenty of tangible things for Americans with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell , and tables heavy with food at church suppers  --  that was religion . Deep down inside Chaplain Bascom suspected that Christ was more than a little of a red ; this was why He 'd been done to death . No American need examine too deeply the nature of Christ . This was what the Baptist Church offered them : a renewal of the spirit on Sundays and Wednesdays , excellent business contacts , and keeping the young away from sinful habits . It was all so down to earth . Chaplain Bascom thought of Thomas Aquinas visiting Spartanburg , South Carolina , and had to slap his chunky thigh . . . . No , the Roman Church was Europe and the past and a dirty slice of history top104boot . He 'd seen enough to know how uneasily Romanism sat on Americans . Whereas your good southern Baptist was his religion walking and in act . So was his good comfortable wife , who cooked for church socials and taught Sunday school . So was his immaculate prim daughter . Practical Christianity . .. . Over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowds in the Galleria Umberto were like all the crowds of the world , drifting and inert except under stimulus . But this crowd had an uncrowdlike tendency to break up into its individual components . Their only common bond as a crowd was that they were all in Naples in August , 1944 . Their focus shifted . Since most of these people came to the Galleria to lose themselves and therefore to find themselves , their flavor was more strongly marked than that of a crowd assembled for a specific purpose . The chaplains noticed isolated elements more easily than they might have at a race track or on a city street . And both chaplains thought to then . selves that this crowd , perhaps more than any other on earth  --  showed the agony of the individual and of society , that some peculiar problem of the age was here mirrored . Presently , in the crushing brilliance of the August sun and the buzzing of the convoys the chaplains found themselves dozing . A burr of laughter brought them sharply to in their chairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even an unconscious man . Two Italian girls skipped arm in arm through the Galleria . There was an intimacy in their leaning on one another more flagrant and saucy than the friendship between school chums . The girls spied the two chaplains , but they danced easily through the Galleria , in no hurry , exclaiming over the shop prices , casting swimming eyes over the lounging GI 's . And they sang . Both chaplains knew that they were singing not out of high spirits but as a call to all interested to come and buy , as a fruit vendor hawks melons in the street . They sang in English . It was an American song learned by rote from many darkened rooms with rumpled beds and empty vino bottles :  --  You 'll nevair know just ow motch I mees you , You 'll nevair know just ow motch I caaaare .. .  --  Those girls are wearing crosses on their necks , said Chaplain Bascom , clucking with his tongue.  --  Are n't they entitled to pray ? Father Donovan asked , setting down his vermouth.  |p105The  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood there swaying enticingly , arms around each other 's waists .  --  Why , allo , major ! Buy me a drink ? Chaplain Bascom for the first time in his army career , instead of flashing the gold oak leaf on his right collar , took hold of his left and wriggled his silver cross at them . Father Donovan began to giggle.  --  What would you have done if you 'd been a rabbi ?  --  I 'm thinking of my wife , roared Chaplain Bascom . Believe me , padre , I 've reached such a maturity of married love that those two women seem to me vile Jezebels.  --  You are a cute one , lieutenant , the other girl said . She sat genially down in the chair at Father Donovan 's right . The waiter brought two vermouths without being asked . Chaplain Bascom reddened as the other girl sank into the wicker chair at his left.  --  I think we should leave at once , with dignity , said Chaplain Bascom.  --  It would be the first issue I ever knew you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right :  --  Are you hungry ?  --  As hungry as the devil for Christian souls , cried Chaplain Bascom . Padre , let 's end this comedy and get out of here . You ca n't touch pitch and not be defiled . . . . I think my wife 's ears are burning back in Spartanburg , South Carolina . . . Padre , think of what you represent.  --  That 's exactly what I 'm doing , Father Donovan said . You and I were in tighter spots than this at Cassino , chaplain . He looked at the girl , who was now nervously stroking her vermouth glass and shivering a little , though it was August . Then she reached out to lay her hand on his arm . But before her fingers descended , she seemed to reconsider and dropped her hand to the beaded bag that lay in her lap.  --  You do n't like me ? she said , making a face . Whassamatta , Joe ?  --  But I do like you , Father Donovan said , taking a thousand lire from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take this and go to a black market restaurant and buy all you want to eat . Then go to confession , hear ? Then go home and get a good sleep . You look very tired . . . . Promise me ? . . . Sacerdos sum . . . . Both girls went quickly away , covering with one hand the jeweled crosses on their necks . They went out of the Galleria into Via Roma.  |  --  They should be horsewhipped by their families , Chaplain Bascom said testily , mopping his beety brow.  --  No , Father Donovan said , replacing his wallet . Their sin is partly the world's.  --  The world , Chaplain Bascom said , blowing his nose with an olive-drab handkerchief . Women go on the streets because they 're just plain ornery and refuse to settle down . . . and Italian women are much more immoral than our own . One minute they 're crossingthemselves in church , and the next they 're on Via Roma . The only way the world is concerned in this filthy business is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has in our own country . Here nobody cares what those women do , because all the Italians are that way . Father Donovan thoughtfully spread his ringless hands and ordered another vermouth . He did n't try to answer Chaplain Bascom directly . He spoke more shyly than usual :  --  We must be cautious in judging impurity because it 's such a natural sin . Not everyone murders . Not everyone robs . But impurity springs from the natural impulses of our own bodies . A deed which under one set of circumstances brings a child into the world becomes under others a mortal sin . Impurity comes from an impulse that we all possess.  --  Then we must wrestle with that impulse , Chaplain Bascom cried in triumph , slapping the table so that the glasses jumped to attention . We must marry if we do n't want to burn , as the Apostle Paul says . . . . I do n't mind telling you , padre , that as a young preacher I wrestled mightily with the lusts of the flesh.  --  Then you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Father Donovan gently . Chaplain Bascom always got riled up in his arguments with Father Donovan . Secretly he feared that the priests of popery got a more subtle and cunning training in propaganda than they gave you at the Baptist seminary . He saw why people feared the Roman Church . You could easily dismiss the run-of-the-mill Catholic as a superstitious fool living in the past , but Father Donovan not only had faith but could explain why he had it . Chaplain Bascom explainedit to himself this way : Catholicism was a secret society whose aim was just barely eluding him . He was sure it was up to no good . This aim was known only to the pope and to a few of the inner circle . Even the average priest did n't know it . Chaplain Bascom was also honest with himself . He knew he was n't Christlike . Yet that name was always in his mouth becausep107it was the open-sesame of his profession . It was a name which had a strange hold over people , possibly because they thought it should . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skeleton key . Nor was Chaplain Bascom quite at ease with the personality of Jesus Christ . His mind was teased by the concept of a carpenter who allowed Himself to be crucified and was remembered and invoked for the next two thousand years . Chaplain Bascom sometimes went so far as to ask himself whether he 'd honestly have liked Christ . Perhaps He was just a little . . . effeminate . All this talk about love . ... Chaplain Bascom acknowledged no other love than one took in the arms of a good woman . Any other love seemed to savor of unmentionable vice ... . Father Donovan broke the silence :  --  You 're thinking hard , chaplain . Is n't it a painful sensation ?  --  Not at all , not at all , my boy ... . And at this moment Chaplain Bascom realized that for two years Father Donovan had been playing with him , in that savage affection with which a cat tortures a mouse . He felt the blood rising under his crimson skin . And he knew at last that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a red-blooded American man . So he changed the subject.  --  I was thinking of the future of the church.  --  Which church ? Father Donovan asked coyly.  --  Christianity , of course , Chaplain Bascom growled . Then something inside his burly soul swung outward like a rusty lock after it 's oiled . He called to the waiter to bring them each a vermouth . Father Donovan looked at the vermouth in front of the Baptist and began to laugh in the high-pitched relieved manner of a boy who has passed an examination he expected to flunk.  --  Thank God I 've lived to see this , chaplain ! Vermouth ! The blackmail I could collect from you if I had a camera ! What would your South Carolina congregation say ? Chaplain Bascom took a huge swig of the vermouth . He made a face like a maddened bull and called for another.  --  Why , I like you so much this way , Father Donovan said still laughing . And there 've been times when you depressed me no end.  --  The fruit of the vine is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mellow voice . In my youth . . .  --  I 'm not hearing your confession , Father Donovan said , raising a hand and smiling . It was getting on to the time of sunset in the Galleria Umberto . The arcade was swelling up with people.  |  --  I 'm worried , said Chaplain Bascom resuming , for the future of the church . You and I both know , padre , that there are atheists in foxholes . And many of these fellows will go back to the States and attempt to sweep away the heritage of the ages . They 'll call all faith simply dead lumber which has survived because people were stupid and afraid.  --  And I 'm of the opinion , said Father Donovan , that good things , like the poor , will always be with us . It 's an article of faith with me that my own church will last till the end of time . As for the others , unless they have something to offer the returning veteran that is free of bigotry and sectionalism , those other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean by that ? cried Chaplain Bascom.  --  Just this . When an American has seen Naples and death and the wretchedness of the whole world , he may try to forget it when he goes back to the farm in Illinois . But he wo n't forget it completely . Malaria and sorrow temper the blood . And do you think that such a man will be satisfied again with a religion which says he may not smoke or drink , which offers strife for peace , which bases its commandments on little stupidities he has outgrown ? .. . After this war we 're going to see either an age of complete barbarismor a gradual return to the simplicities and felicities of Our Lord 's life , adapted of course to the time in which we live . . . . And I , chaplain , have faith in human nature , which is n't intrinsically evil . There are many things in human life that you and I have almost forgotten since we put on these uniforms . It 's natural to lose sight of these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And there are reckonings to come for all this slaughter . . . . But as surely as I know there 's sin in the world , I know also that there 's that in us which makes us desire to bring up our children in love and peace , which makes us shield our wives and daughters , and which occasionally makes us capable of the noblest sacrifice . .. . You ca n't tell me that these virtues will ever utterly disappear . . . . You remember how far the striking of a match carried in those black nights on the line ? So tiny but so bright ? Well , just like that match , whatever is good will survive till the end of the world . Otherwise human life becomes the cruelest joke and the figure of Christ on the cross the hollowest gesture that anyone ever made.  --  Let 's have chow , Chaplain Bascom said , wiping his eye . They arose together and replaced their chairs as though they 'd been at a formal dinner . Chaplain Bascom took Father Donovan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father Donovan took pride in his uniform as he had pride in his Massp109vestments , so he looked down to see if his trousers were neatly belled out over his combat boots . In this same spirit he called Chaplain Bascom 's attention to his protruding shirttail . The Galleria was filtered with air currents . At the transept crossingfrom the San Carlo Theater to Via Santa Brigida a column of cool air swam on the heat.  --  Say , I feel that vermouth , Chaplain Bascom said heavily.  --  There are worse things to feel , Father Donovan said brightly . He loved the Galleria because it was always full of Neapolitan children  --  children begging , children selling , children looking , children shuffling barefoot . What caught at him most were the little children pimping . They 'd learned a perfect and Saxon English for the pleasures they offered for sale , and their obscene phrases smote Father Donovan more brutally than the worst sins he 'd heard in the confessional , where at least he could be impersonal . But when a Neapolitan child played the bawd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke them , and they seemed all the fouler because the child understood their import . Father Donovan wonderedabout Americans who were capable of teaching such things to little Neapolitans of seven and eight . Sometimes when he lay awake at night , he thought of the tragedy of the children of Europe , born and passing their formative years under a rain of bombs , keeping alive by catering to the desires of soldiers . What would these poor children be like in maturity , who had never known the innocence of childhood ? If these children grew into cold bitter reptiles , then the world would really have lost the war ... .  --  Next week , said Chaplain Bascom , if we 're still here , I mean to bring some soap and wash these children 's mouths out.  --  There are better uses for soap in Naples than that . These children , Father Donovan thought , are the same as those in South Philadelphia . They 're the same as kids all over the world . I wish I had them all to teach them baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aloud , are the saddest spectacle of the war.  --  But we have slums in the States too.  --  Oh I know that , I know that . But these children have no escape at all . . . not even a settlement house . The chaplains went down the steps of the Galleria that lead to Via Verdi.  --  What a place that arcade is , said Chaplain Bascom . A great novel could be made of it . I suppose the market place in Jerusalem was like this arcade . Except that Christ is n't here.  |  --  Oh , I disagree with you , Father Donovan said . I think He is .. . very much so . They waited for a truck convoy to pass them with a roaring and a streaking . Across Via Verdi was a transient mess for American officers . In August , 1944 , it was busier than a Childs . In shifts officers ate a soup , a plate of warmed-up C-ration , and a saucer of canned pears . It seemed as though every officer ( except airplane drivers ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a screen door that swung and clattered . On this door always hung one of two signs-OPEN or CLOSED . When this mess ran out of C-ration , the CLOSED sign went up like a storm flag . Winding out of the entrance was a queue of officers , a depressed little concentration of nurses clutching their shoulder bags , and civilian secretaries of the State Department and the War Shipping Administration . Officers paid ten lire a meal , civilians thirty-five . Ducking the bobbing screen door was a hag in a torn black dress who sold Stars and Stripes , Yank , and Time . She saluted all officers who bought a paper and beamed on them with jagged gums . One rumor had it that she was born during the Vesuvius eruption of 79 A.D. , another that she was the sybil come in from Cumae because business was better in Naples , another that she was Eleanor Roosevelt in disguise , gatheringmaterial for her column . Father Donovan and Chaplain Bascom went to the tail of the line and mopped their faces and their necks in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mess , the line would inch up four places . The tables in the mess were like those beds where people sleep in shifts . An old Neapolitan was wiping the untidy table top , stacking plates , and talking threateningly to himself . Chaplain Bascom seated himself and beat on the table jovially so that all the glassware vaulted.  --  Mangiare , Joe . And be presto about it too . The old Neapolitan retreated and was seen no more . Father Donovan turned his quick timid smile on a young Neapolitan in a drenched white coat who brought them two plates of soup.  --  Buona sera , Joe . Come state ?  --  Ehhhh ! the young Neapolitan said , relaxing and smiling . Non c'e male . Ma c'e troppo lavoro ... .  --  Dago-lover , said Chaplain Bascom . These people are good for nothing but to sing operas and work in barbershops . Father Donovan did n't answer . He was making the sign of the cross prefatory to saying grace before meals.  |  --  You know that embarrasses me in public , Chaplain Bascom continued. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said when he 'd finished his brief prayer . Chaplain Bascom plowed into his soup . He continued to watch suspiciously the slight brown hands making their second sign of the cross in front of the Purple Heart ribbon on the priest 's left breast . Father Donovan then applied himself to his soup . He ate demurely , never looking at what he was eating.  --  In the seminary , he said , they used to read aloud from pious writings while we were at our meals . So naturally I expect nothing but edifying thoughts from you until dessert . The chaplains looked distrustfully at the second course , which was what they knew it would be : diced pork with beans , dehydrated potatoes , spinach , and a leaf of lettuce.  --  I keep thinking of Missus Bascom 's fried chicken.  --  But just taste this iced tea , Father Donovan cried gaily . You 're having qualms because you drank three glasses of vermouth . Do n't . Saint Thomas says we may drink till we feel hilarious . They both arose as two nurses prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , boys ?  --  Not at all , not at all , girls . With women Chaplain Bascom was almost feudal . In the slight glow of the vermouth he was still enraged that he had n't scored one this afternoon on Father Donovan.  --  Oh , padres , one nurse giggled . We could use a little salvation , Tessie . The nurses were older than most ANC 's . They had an air of edgy misanthropy of women overseas too long . They had also a certain pride in their captaincies , since every nurse above the rank of second lieutenant considers that she has jumped the Rubicon.  --  And where are you girls from ? Chaplain Bascom purred . It was a theory of his that people could be put at their ease by any of a dozen key phrases.  --  Oh lands , said the nurse named Elsie , let 's not go into that . The only thing we 're sure of is that this is Naples , Italy , and that we wan na go home and can't.  --  You girls have the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh we know that , Tessie said . But since Salerno it 's been goddam ... beg your pardon . . . wearing . They smoked while eating , holding their cigarettes in paintedp112fingernails which nevertheless betrayed how often those hands had been in hot water.  --  There 's nothing pleasant about overseas assignments , Father Donovan said , slicing his preserved pear.  --  You can say that again , Father ! As soon as I looked at you , I knew you was a priest . . . . Remember me in your prayers so I can stay outa the booby hatch.  --  I promise , Father Donovan said . The chaplains finished their meal and said good night to the nurses.  --  If they did n't smoke like stoves , Chaplain Bascom said on the way out of the mess , they would n't be so nervous.  --  Well , I expect they 're lonely and very very tired . On the sidewalk outside the transient officers ' mess they put on their caps and peered at one another in the sunset that streamed down through the dome of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Shall we go back to our tent in the Dust Bowl ?  --  Look , said Chaplain Bascom . What 's that ? Between the two stairways of the Galleria that cascaded into Via Verdi there was an entrance they 'd not noticed before . Over the doorway hung a sign in yellow and red : ARIZONAFor Allied OfficersNow Father Donovan could n't imagine what Arizona was doing in Naples . But since he was fond of western movies , he thought this might be worth looking into . Chaplain Bascom said :  --  Since you put me on the path to perdition with vermouth , we might as well look in . Maybe they have cactus plants and saddle horses . The corridor of the Arizona was leaden with smoke . A girl sat in a checkroom the size of a telephone booth . She reached out as they passed and flipped their caps out of their belts.  --  But we wo n't be staying long , girlie , Chaplain Bascom said , reaching for his cap.  --  Hundred lireee , pleeese , she shrieked and put their caps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Father Donovan said out of his movie vocabulary . Inside there was nothing but a small room swimming in smoke . Tables were crammed about a cleared square no bigger than ap113checkerboard . Officers hunched over these tables , a few French , a few British . But most were American airplane drivers with their high soft boots ensconced also on the tables . Everybody was drinkingsteadily . But somehow the chaplains sensed that nothing had really begun yet . On a dais smothered in greenery a small Italian band was playing dance music . They did it self-consciously , as though they were imitating phonograph records . Steered by Chap  --  lain Bascom , Father Donovan sat down at a table on the edge of the cleared space . Trying to feel at ease , he tapped his boot to the music. - Everybody 's looking at us queerly , Chaplain Bascom whispered . Our insignia must stick out like a neon sign.  --  No one 's looking at us . A waiter shambled up and regarded them with menacing timidity . Evidently something went on at the Arizona which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquering army.  --  Now this will be on me , Father Donovan said grandly , bringingout his Ayrab wallet . Will you bring us a bottle of . . . champagne , please ?  --  Good Lord , Chaplain Bascom said . When the wine came Father Donovan blanched at the price , but to make good his gesture he paid up without a murmur . An airplanedriver with swollen eyes leaned over chummily from the next table :  --  It ai n't the champagne ya payin for here , kids.  --  Atmosphere , I presume ? Father Donovan said , feeling quite worldly . He 'd learned much from the movies.  --  ti Tell , ya can call it that , the airplane driver said . He was on the wrong side of the chaplains to see the crosses on their collars . I keep comin here night after night . I call myself a beast , but I keep comin .... Roger.  --  What 's he talking about ? Chaplain Bascom whispered . He 's drunk . No wonder they have so many casualties in the air force.  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jack , I come here to fergit my troubles , not for fights with doughfeet . But if ya spoilin for a bruise , wait till my buddy gets back from the bobo , an we 'll mop up the floor with the botha yez . . . . Roger.  --  We 're not in the infantry , Father Donovan said , laying a hand on his arm . We 've just worked with it a little . And since we 're both in the same army , there 's not much sense in a fight , is there ?  --  Roger , the airplane driver said.  |p114He  settled back mollified and beamed on Father Donovan 's Purple Heart . He pointed to his own , to his wings , and to the Twelfth Air Force patch on his left shoulder . It had been crocheted in rhinestones by some Neapolitan . He winked at Father Donovan and reached over to put an arm about his shoulders.  --  Y'are all right , lootenant . But who 's that ole beagle with ya ? Shoulda left him home . With a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses precisely in the middle of the table and poured out the champagne . It bubbled so cool and golden that even Chaplain Bascom assumed his Something Special air . They clinked glasses . Father Donovan was a host for the first time in his life . Being curate under a bitter brooding pastor in South Philadelphia had somewhatpinched his naturally hospitable nature . All he 'd ever been able to do for anyone was to teach kids baseball . Only in saying Mass had he ever been in a position to do something grand for other people.  --  Delicious , said Chaplain Bascom , smacking his lips . I see the point of Solomon 's warning against wine . Look how it giveth its color in the cup.  --  That guy talks like a chaplain , the airplane driver muttered , emerging from a funk in which he 'd laid his head on his chest .  --  I am a chaplain , Chaplain Bascom said loftily.  --  Then what are ya doin in this place , Father ?  --  I am not a priest.  --  Well , ya should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicacy in him that made him itch and sweat when things did n't run smoothly.  --  Some of our champagne ? he said to the airplane driver . The flier had been regarding them with a confused affection and hostility , like a dog making up its mind . He tottered to their table and seated himself with the help of Father Donovan.  --  Thank ya . My buddy musta died in the bobo . Since last month at Cerignola , all ya have to do is yell flak , an we all start shittin .. . Chaplain Bascom twitched . An now my missions is all done , Roger . I 'm goin back to the States.  --  Well , I advise you to watch your language when you get there , said Chaplain Bascom . There are ladies in America.  --  If you was n't a major , I might be tempted to tellya to blow it . In fact , I think I will anyway.  --  I 'd hate to pull my rank on you , Chaplain Bascom said.  |  --  That 's all you Protestant chaplains is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after leavin a little piddlin church in Georgia that pays ya five bucks a Sunday .. .  --  We 're all friends here , boy , Father Donovan said . The flier gave a windy sigh , said Roger , and went to sleep on Father Donovan 's shoulder . He removed the dead weight softly from himself and settled the head on another table . At this moment some glasses and bottles went whizzing through the air and crackled against the orchestra stand . A fight began in the farthest corner between three airplane drivers and two combat engineers . The noise rose in level as though an invisible hand had turned up the volume control on a radio . What was going on the chaplains could n't see clearly for the billowing smoke and the crowds pushing in from their tables . The disturbers of the peace were lured out the door by the Italian manager into the arms of waiting MP's.  --  Nice place , said Chaplain Bascom , sipping his champagne . Then girls appeared and sat down invited or not at varioustables . The din rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Why , Chaplain Bascom said , this place is a taxi dance hall . The airplane driver came to and straightened up . He identifiedthe girls for Father Donovan :  --  That 's Lola with the green handkerchief . . . . That 's Gina with the earrings . . . . That one there signalin the waiter is Bruna ... . That number in red is Bianca Stella .... Most of em is married to officers in the Italian Army that are prisoners of war . All these cheesecakes have bambini . But a gal has to make a livin . . . . Mamma mia , what a covey of quail . . . . They all got a union rate of two thousand lire a night ... an do n't tell me that us airplane drivers have inflated the prices .... But 0 Roger , Roger ... . Father Donovan and Chaplain Bascom turned on one another as though they 'd just met and were sizing one another up.  --  Look , Chaplain Bascom moaned hoarsely . A girl had come out in front of the orchestra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sang " I 'll Be Seeing You in All the Old Familiar Places . " A carnation was stuck in her hair . She wore a dress that seemed to have been sewn from pieces of lace and silk rooted out of ashcans.  --  That 's Lydia , the airplane driver said , his eyes bloodshot . An she do n't gim me the time of day.  --  It seems , whispered Father Donovan , rising from the table , that Lydia is about to take off her clothes.  |p116The  two chaplains retreated through the maze of tables where the officers leaned forward toward Lydia through the iron-gray smoke . Some had girls on their knees who incited them to drink deeply , to forget everything but This Moment Now . Through the fumes eyes looked out at Lydia with weariness and desire and fever . There was an air of daze and bestial futility cut by the mechanical-saw voice of Lydia . The chaplains got their caps . The MP at the door leered at their insignia . Outside it was dark . Evening had come to Naples , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pillow over a sleeper 's face . Down the steps of the Galleria Umberto came buzzing evidence of trafficking going on up there in the blackout . Chaplain Bascom was sweating and panting as he put his cap on his head and set it determinedly at a forty-five-degree angle . Father Donovan said nothing but bent down and tucked his trousers over his combat boots . Then he noticed a little girl sitting on the curb . She had blond hair , so rare in Neapolitan babies . She seemed so tiny and alone . She was peeling a stick of American chewing gum , her mouth already open in anticipation . And her eyes glowed like a kitten 's at dusk . Father Donovan walked over to talk to her . He had another stick of gum in his pocket to give her . But she , fearful of her treasure , darted out into the street . He laughed and ran after her . Around the corner from the San Carlo an English lorry turned in . It slid like a huge coffin behind the blackout lenses on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the little girl 's bobbing hair , on the pursuing legs of Father Donovan . Chaplain Bascom saw what was happening . He shouted and leaped into the street after them . The lorry bore down . His ears exploded with the scream of brakes and the crunch of bodies , as collies are mashed under heavy turning wheels . On the opposite curb the tiny Neapolitan girl watched the truck back off . The two bodies lay there quietly , one with a bit of purple silk ribbon over his heart . She put her gum into her mouth . Americani . For it was n't the first time she 'd seen the dead lying in the streets of Naples.  |p117(Algiers)REMEMBER  LEARNING ALL OVER AGAIN HOW TO WALK . MYgait was something between a sailor 's and a mountaineer 's . ForRue Michelet winds and grinds to the top of the city . Walking in Algiers means going either uphill or down . Consequently I was forever leaning forward or backward . I got to be uneasy on a level stretch , the way a drunk 's nerves twitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more European than Casa . In the summer of 1944 there was a quality of reaching out . It was the old Paris trying to find itself . Most of the people in Algiers were refugees from Paris and were waiting to get back there . They rejoiced over the Normandy invasion because it was the beginning of an attrition they 'd thirsted for since June , 1940 . Sometimes I thought it was we Americans who were getting Paris back for them , but I did n't say so . I remember that in Algiers many French soldiers wore our uniform . It was easy to tell that they were n't Americans  --  something narrower about their eyes , something contracted and concentrated in everything they did . Nevertheless they wore our uniforms , and the Mediterranean Base Section decided that a discrimination must be made  --  possibly to keep us out of the Kasbah and out of certain bars and areas smelling of bed sheets and strange foods . So we had to affix to our caps the little brass circlet US . Then it was clear to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who an American . It was the first time I saw British soldiers . Till July of 1944 Allied Force Headquarters was at Algiers . In the AFHQ offices there was an Englishman to counterbalance every American . Thus the streets of Algiers clomped with British hobnails . The British wore shorts till 1800 hours . Through the leafy heat their legs bobbed like brown pistons . They wore canvas gaiters and short sleeves and beretsp118designed after the queen 's own tam . On Rue Michelet and Rue d'Isly I remember the signs in the windows : wo 's &; SGT 'S CLUBS . The OR 's had theirs too . But the British said that we Yanks were better off than they . They 'd been a long time away from Blighty , as long ago as Tobruk , and they resented our rations and our cigarettes and our theaters . ENSA was never like this , they said . They scratched their bare legs , bitten by the anopheles mosquito . I remember my first pass in Algiers . I knew just where I wanted to go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shimmered over Algiers Harbor like silver kidneys . The port was teeming with hospital ships , the air buzzed with planes flying into Maison Blanche . I walked down Rue Michelet , leaning backward . Along my way were green public gardens , but their iron gates were locked at sundown.  --  Why , myte ? Because you bloody Yanks used to myke a shamblesof them after nightfall . Through the heat of Algiers I looked inside the scrolled gratings . I could see the fountains playing and the statues with inscriptions in French . What , no walks there after dark ? At noon French girls walked there on their lunch hour from the office . They were crisper and cooler than the Casablancaises.  --  Closer to French love all the time . The wimmin in Casablanca have seen too many Ayrabs . I remember how few Ayrabs there were in the city itself , as though the French had put guards at the entrances . I saw Ayrabs only when I was out in trucks , along the roads to Maison Carree or Maison Blanche or spying on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less an African city . It was also the French everywhere spoken . I stopped many times as I strolled along , trying not to seem a country cousin just in from Casa :  --  Oo sir troove 1'Hotel Aletti ?  --  Il n'est pas trop loin , monsieur . The Hotel Aletti . Only colonels and generals and foreign correspondentslived in it . But everybody flocked to its gardens and terrace , and not to look at the colonels and the generals and the war correspondents . Nearly every GI in the city of Algiers converged afternoons on the Hotel Aletti , like the rays of the sun in heraldic designs . I 'd go to the Place d'Isly and turn right toward the harbor . I 'd pass the street of the peppermint columns of the Bar Pigalle , where people in white linen drank vermouth and talked of Paris . Then I 'd turn left on a ramp and go downhill again , leaning backwards.  --  That there 's the Aletti , kids . The Passion Pit of Algiers ... .  |p119I  remember that in front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables and umbrellas . There was constant movement here of people with glasses in their hands , swarming on the different planes like drunks at a garden party . It was almost a terrace restaurant where people idle and look for and at other people . In the Aletti garden there was an excitement seemingly without reason . Occasionally a brigadier general would issue martiallyfrom inside the hotel , picking his way among the tables and the Ayrab shoeshine boys . GI 's would lower their eyes to their drinks . But the ladies would appraise the general 's mistress . Sometimesit was a Red Cross girl . But oftener it was an Algerienne whom he kept in lipstick and an apartment near the Saint Georges . The BG 's lady sometimes flew to Italy with him in his plane when he made inspections . I remember that persons with a purpose never stayed long in the outdoor garden of the Aletti . They 'd go into the lobby , which looked as though it should be cool . But it never was . It was like the lobby of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs . On these GI 's lolled . Past their relaxed bodies flitted the corps of mademoiselles , about fifty in number . They had union hours and union prices . The rules of courtship were n't strictly observed . The GI 's just lay in their chairs drinking , while the girls moved from one cluster to the next , making their sales talk . They knew instinctively where to do their promoting , working from the bar to the farthest recesses of the lounge . They spoke to as many as two hundred GI 's in the two hours that the bar stayed open . I remember their French social sense . Even if I was n't interested , they 'd make a social call on me lasting five minutes in return for a drink , a cigarette , and a stick of gum . For ten francs the bar offered white wine with a block of ice in it . It was a strong and melancholy drink . I remember the Duchess , who always sat alone in a pink straw hat , drinking and smoking and thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her profession . She knew French poetry , the opera , and the gossip of the haut monde . If I bought her a drink , she accepted it so that I understood the great favor she was doing me . Nor did she ever entertain a proposal till closing time , since goodly fellowship was more important to her than her career . She viewed her lovers with a mellow cynicism . I knew she was out of her century . But I did n't tell her , for the Duchess knew it herself.  --  Haas , she said , picking up her gloves at closing time , qu'ai-je fait de ma jeunesse ?  |p120I  remember the most sought-after , Emilie the tigress . She was an exhausting girl . She 'd fling herself on me in a rage of delight , chewing her gum madly , her eyes spewing forth little sparks of coldest fire . She nudged me , prodded me , kicked me , pulled my hair , nipped at my ears . She 'd get hold of my waist and squeeze and tickle and maul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Crache-moi dans la bouche et dismoique tu m'aimes ! Then she 'd get bored with me and egg the other girls on to fights . I remember discovering that this was an epileptic fit that she sustainedfor two hours because she was , as it were , on the stage in the Aletti . I remember that the prettiest of them all was Claudette , who 'd come in with her suitcase from Tunis for the pickings . Because she was as fresh and straightforward as an American girl , she was the most popular . Claudette talked a rolling salty English . She made it quite clear that with her stipends from the Allied troops in Algiers she could retire a rich woman in another year.  --  And I wo n't be a beatup old bag , either ! Claudette said . She never allowed herself to be sampled in public , which was part of the selling propaganda of the other girls . At the bar of the Aletti stood a circle of misanthropes , officers , and people who wanted to look at the circus without standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened and gazed at the ground . What conversation they made to one another or to me heightened my sense of the mania and irrelevance of the war . Nothing they said registered with me at all . It was as though a comedian were to describe death to an audience in a burlesque theater . They all simply lectured when they talked . In the things they said there was n't an attempt to establish contact with another human being . They raved like people coming out of anesthetic . They 'd built their walls around them for the duration . I remember that the only person who dared intrude on these solitary drinkers was some girl who was n't doing too well for herself in the Aletti lobby . But she too soon saw how these anonymities had been frightened , how they came to the Aletti bar merely in order not to lose their hold on humanity . It was that vague escape from misanthropy in which one frequents crowds in order to assure oneself one has n't lost the way . I remember that sometimes I 'd grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aletti Victory Girls . So I too would stand at the bar with the zombies . I 'd take a token white wine and wedge myself in with the rest of the dying pack . When the winep121nibbled at me , I sometimes caught psychic currents I could n't explain . I 'd look up with a sudden uneasiness and see someone at the other end of the bar communicating with me by signals that seemed to have been already agreed on between us . And then I sensed that I could talk out of this world , as one sometimes does with total strangers on railway trains and in confessionals . SometimesI was close to believing that old crud about the wigwags human beings send out to others when they 're lonely , as insects are said to talk with the scraping of their wings . And I too began to slide around in the dihedrals of time and space , slipping in and out of being like a ball bearing in a maze . I remember that sometimes my life in that sweating bar of the Hotel Aletti looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then my mind would start gyrating like a corn popper and I 'd have to quiet myself by reasoning that I 'd been away from the States a long time , that I was drunk , and my mind was playing me dirty tricks . It was trying to be God and come face to face with itself . But why ? why ? why ? At these moments I 'd see myself rocketing out into space , seeing this world from the viewpointof eternity . How tiny we all were , how like fleas dolled up for a pageant . I remember that a second lieutenant of the engineers used to drink every afternoon at the bar of the Hotel Aletti . For a week I watched him . He fled the girls and leaned in the farthest corner of the bar , holding onto his drink as gods clutch at their membra in orgies . I wondered why he never had a buddy . He had hair as white as the snow that Algiers never sees , and a thin sunburned face . He looked like the social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't act like them . If anyone spoke to him , he 'd reply in just as many words as they 'd used on him , smile as though to tell them they did n't see the farce of it all , and return to his wine . If after this an attempt was still made to continue the conversation , he 'd smile again and softly change his place at the bar . His encounters with Emilie and Lucie and Bettine used to make me wonder . I think they were afraid of him . He 'd disengage himself from their arms and their nipping teeth with the slippery coolness of an invisible fish . One evening , I remember , when the white wine had taken a communicative turn in me , I slipped into the place next him and waited shyly , tingling a little . I ordered another white wine with the Aletti ice cube bobbing in it and looked at my boots . It was odd to feel him close by me . It seemed as though all air had been sucked into the place where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soap and shaving lotion , as though he strove to be impersonal . I know my army officers pretty well , having observed them for years from the perspective of a pebble looking up and squinting at the white bellies of the fish nosing above it . Americans usually go mad when by direction of the president of the United States they ; put a piece of metal on their collars . They do n't know whether they 're the Lone Ranger , Jesus Christ , or Ivanhoe . Few Americans I ever knew could sustain the masquerade of an officer . Their grease paint kept peeling in unexpected places . I heard that in combat the good officers simply knew their men well and did them one better in daring . But to be a good officer out of combat demands a sort of shadowboxing between truth and posing . Europeans know the secret . But few Americans can play the nobleman without condescensionor chicken . American officers fall into three easy slots of the doughnut machine . The feminine ones , I mean those who register life and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on the receiving end from the GI 's under them . If they rule at all , it 's by power of their gentleness , which can fasten a GI in tight bonds once his will consents and admires . Second , there are the violent and the aggressive , who as commissioned officers assume a male and fatherly part ranging from drunken pas who whale their sons on Saturday nights to the male and nursing tenderness of an athletic coach . Yet these most masculine men are n't always the best officers in a crisis or showdown . Third , there are those commissioned nonentities who as civilians were male stenographers , file clerks , and X-ray technicians . They are neither masculine nor feminine . They move through the army in polyp groups of their own sort . They 're never alone . I can be in the same room with such officers without feeling the presence of anything or anyone . Touching their personalities is like poking at a dish of lemon jello . They smile and assume another shape . I remember standing beside the white-haired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't speak soon , I 'd scream , as the saying goes . I did n't know into which of my three slots he fell . He seemed a coin with the milling rubbed off.  --  Do n't be so goddam condescending , corporal.  --  Pardon , sir ? I said . I jumped at the sound of his voice . I realized that his mind had been tracking mine for the past five minutes . This lieutenant had a voice that began at his navel and got muted in his sinuses . As he leaned toward me , his breath was mixed with wine and peppermint.  |  --  You 've been watching me for the past week , corporal , he said .  --  A GI looks up to his officers , sir . Or wants to ... .  --  Ah . . . you hoped to prove to yourself that I 'm a sad sack . Well , I am . Completely lost . . . . How do you know you 're in Algiers ? Or for that matter what proof can you give me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , I said , gulping my wine so that I could buy him one and establish some ground between him and myself.  --  Your curiosity will be the death of you , corporal . Play safe and retreat into some sort of role . . . . It 's wonderful how in a war you can purge yourself and become nothing or everything . . . . I for example have lost my touch with life . I 'm like those basket cases in combat . A man still alive but limbless and deaf , dumb , and blind . I just lie in a great white bed , my brain still functioning , but able to make no impression on the world outside me .... Do you understand me ? You have the face of a ferret or a weasel . . . . But knowingtoo much will sicken you . Just go back to being convenient and optimistic and slick and conventional.  --  The lieutenant speaks a fine English , I said , gulping.  --  Do n't address me in the third person . You 're like the Ayrabs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an American corporal , and you have confused ideas of democracy and independence and the four freedoms . You loathe saluting me on the street . You think , that sonofabitch shavetail . . . . So do n't think you 're kidding me when you address me in the third person . It 's not respectful . It 's fawning . . . . So for God 's sake just cut out that crap . . . . You came here to talk , and I 'm giving you what you asked for . You 'll never want to talk to me again , which will be healthier for both of us.  --  Shall I go away now , sir ? I said , bridling and trembling at the same time.  --  If you like . But you wo n't .... I 'm your experience for today . Well , I 'll give you a dose of me.  --  Well , I try to give everybody an even break , I stuttered.  --  Except me , corporal , except me . For one solid week now you 've been staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grope from these putains . . . . Did it ever occur to you that I have a right to privacy ? Is your own life so small that you must enlarge it by listening in on my party lines ?  --  You 've got me all wrong , sir . . .  --  Mother of shit , the lieutenant said , his voice as cool and removed as ever , how I envy you mediocre people ! Since I came overseas I 've been in a position where nothing has squared withp124the education I got . I have a good mind . And it 's disciplined . I know Shakespeare and Mozart and calculus and how to hold my moxie . But nothing I learned at Yale has given me any preparation for the mad world in which I find myself . . . . Do you all think you 're playing a game with high stakes ? Are you happy to be a Joiner ? Are you happy moving in herds and thinking as the news . papers and the radio commercials tell you to ? What sweet con @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm an American , therefore better than anyone else in the world ! . . . You see , corporal , the human race is getting worse all the time . Each year we know less than we did in the preceding . We 're more no-account now than we were five hundred years ago . Five hundred years from now I doubt that there 'll be any of us left on earth . Just thousands of wrecked planes and burned-out tanks from the South Pole to the steppes of Russia . . . . We get smugger all the time . We call forces of destruction and speed , the March of Progress ... .  --  Born in the States , sir ? I said feebly after a pause.  --  Born there , corporal , but probably sha' n't die there . I had ideas of aristocracy without class , of brotherhood without familiarityand sentimentality . And I studied and I read and I admired nature and art . And I said what a piece of work is man , and I believed it . But it looks as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assures me that a new age is at hand.  --  It 's the turning point in history , sir , for the little man ... . I murmured this , for it was something I 'd read that morning in Stars and Stripes , Mediterranean.  --  The fallacy of the machine and the mob , corporal . If the murder gets over , everything will then be geared to the lowest common denominator , as it is in the American public schools . The queer , the beautiful , the gentle , and the wondering will all go down before a race of healthy baboons with football letters on their sweaters . . . . I was a letter man at Yale . . . . And the end of the world will come as a tittering anticlimax , because we 're going to shut ourselves out from the stream of truth , and drown in pettiness and small talk.  --  You fear the little man , sir ?  --  The term little man is a phrase of self-pity . Faugh , corporal ... . I remember that I excused myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Aletti into the streets of Algiers . I looked back at him as I turned out the door , bumping into a colonel . I remember thinking with an ache of pity and laughter that this was the last time the young lieutenant would speak . For no one man can put his hands up to stop a locomotive ... .  |p125MOMMA  ALWAYS LAY A WHILE IN HER BED WHEN SHE AWOKE . Poppa was up four hours earlier and went out into the streets of Naples for a walk , to buy Risorgimento and to drink his caffe espresso . He said it made him nervous to lie beside her because she cooed to herself as she slept . That love which Poppa no longer desired of her Momma showeredon the clientele of her bar . One reason she cooed in her sleep was that she was one of the richest women in Naples . She could afford to buy black market food at two thousand lire a day . She ate better than the Americans . She had furs and lovely dresses and patent leather pumps which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Momma had come from a poor family in Milan , but she 'd made herself into one of the great ladies of Naples . And the merchants of Naples , when they sent her monthly bills , instead of writing signora before her name , wrote N.D. , standing for nobil donna . As the churches of Naples struck noon , Momma got out of her bed . She was wearing a lace nightie brought her from Cairo by an American flier . Momma knew that the flier had made money on the deal , but no other woman in Naples had one like it . In the old days she 'd have driven Poppa mad with this lace nightie . But now he simply crawled in beside her , felt the sheer stuff , and , clucked his tongue in disapproval . Poppa was first and last a Neapolitan . Even in the early days of their marriage he 'd never grasped the fineness of Momma 's grain . But she was beyond such bitterness now . She loved the world , and the world returned her love in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Madonna of Pompei , flanked by two tapers and a pot of pinks , Momma said her morning prayers . She thanked the Virgin for saving her during the bombard/ments of Naples . But the Virgin had n't spared that lovely appartamentoin Piazza Garibaldi . And Momma prayed for all the sweet boys who came to her bar , that they might soon be returned to their families  --  but not too soon , for Momma loved their company . And she prayed also for the future of poor Italy , that the line up by Florence might soon be smashed by the American Fifth Army . And she prayed that I1 Duce and his mistress Claretta Petacci might see the error of their ways . Finally Momma prayed that all the world might be as prosperous and happy as she herself was . With the bombing of her apartment in Piazza Garibaldi in March , 1943 , Momma 'd been able to salvage only her frigidaire . Everything else had been destroyed  --  the lovely linens she 'd brought Poppa with her dowry from Milan , her fragile plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found among the rubble , pert and smiling as a bomb shelter . Momma 'd wept the whole day ; then she and Poppa had moved into a dreary set of rooms on the third floor of the Galleria Umberto . Momma 'd got the rooms , leaned , set the frigidaire in the kitchen , and bought secondhand furniture by cautious shopping in Piazza Dante . But her heart as a homemaker had died in the ruins of that appartamento to which Poppa had brought her as a bride . She lived now only for her bar and for the Allied soldiers who came there every night except Sunday . In fact Momma was only treading water all day long until 1630 hours , at which time the provost marshal of Naples allowed her to open her bar . At 1930 MP 's came to make sure it was closed . Three hours . Yet in those three hours Momma lived more than most folks do in twenty-four . She 'd opened her bar the night after Naples fell to the Allies , in October , 1943 . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name stuck . And because Momma had an instinctive knack for entertaining people , her bar was the most celebrated in Naples . Indeed a Kiwi had once told her that it was famous all over the world , that everyone in the Allied armies told everyone else about it . Momma rejoiced . Her only selfish desire was to be renowned as a great hostess . She was happy that she made money in her bar , but that was n't her be-and-end-all . She knew that she was going down in history with Lili Marlene and the Mademoiselle of Armentieres  --  though for a different reason . Momma brushed her teeth with American dentrifice while the water ran into her tub . She studied her hair in the mirror . Forp127ten years she 'd been hennaing it . But she was too honest to go on kidding the world . She was forty-six . In the face of that sacred title , Momma , it seemed to her sacrilegious to sit every night behind her cash register with crimson hair glowing in the lights . So she 'd stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transitionalstage , with gray and white and henna streaked through it . But the 11 momentary ugliness of her hair was worth her title . At closing time in her bar , some of her boys , a bit brilli , would cry on her shoulder and tell her that she looked just like some elderly lady in Arkansas or Lyon or North Wales or the Transvaal or Sydney . Then she 'd pat their hands and say :  --  Ah , mio taro ! Se fosse qui la Sua mamma ! .. . She 'd never been able to learn English , though she understood nearly everything that was said to her in it . Momma climbed into the tub after she 'd sprinkled in some salts a merchant seaman had brought her from New York . Her body was getting a little chunky , but she tried her best to keep it trim , the way a Momma 's should be . At first she 'd worn a pince-nez until Poppa had told her she looked like a Sicilian carthorse with blinders . So she had reverted to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her pasta asciutta , her risotti , and her peperoni . She knew that a Momma must n't be skinny either . She dressed herself in black silk and laid out a quaint straw hat on which a stuffed bird sprawled eating cherries . She opened her drawerful of silk stockings . You could count on the fingers of one hand the women in Naples of August , 1944 , who owned silk stockings  --  were they prostitutes on the Toledo or marchese in villas at Bagnoli . But Momma had em ; she averaged a pair a week from her American admirers . Momma considered herself one of the luckiest ladies in the world . She knew that no woman gets presents for nothing . Finally dressed and fragrant and cool in spite of the furnace that was Naples in August , 1944 , Momma took up her purse and looked around the apartment before locking it . She checked the ice in the frigidaire . Sometimes , after she was compelled to close her bar , she invited her favorite boys up for extra drinks . She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Galleria Umberto . At this hour it was empty of Neapolitans because of the heat . But the Allied soldiery was already out in full force . The bars were n't open , so they just loitered against the walls reading their Stars and Stripes orp128whistling at the signorine . A few waved to Momma , and she bowed to them . Then she went onto the Toledo , which Il Duce had vulgarized into Via Roma . Here she clutched her bag more tightly . Like anybody else born in Milan , she had no use for Neapolitans or Sicilians . They thought the world owed them a living , so they preyed on one another with a malicious vitality , like monkeys removingone another 's fleas . And now that the Allies were in Naples , the Neapolitans were united in milking them . Momma knew that the Neapolitans hated her because she was rich and because she refused to speak their dialect . She walked through them all with her head in the air , clutching her purse . Some who knew her called out vulgar names in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them no attention . She and Poppa usually lunched together at a black market restaurant on Via Chiaia , patronized by Americans and those few Italians who could afford the price of a meal there . Today Poppa was out campaigning for public office at the Municipio , so Momma ate alone at her special table . Sometimes she suspected that Poppa had a mistress . But then he would n't stand a chance at snapping up anything really good , what with all the Allies in Naples . The treatment Momma got at this restaurant was in a class by itself . Naturally the Americans got fawned on , but then they did n't know what the waiters said about them in the kitchen . Whereas Momma , as an Italian who 'd made a success in the hardiest times Naples had ever known , always got a welcome as though she were Queen Margherita . There were flowers on her table and special wines rustled up from the cellar , although the Allies got watered vino ordinario . And when Momma entered , the orchestra stopped playing American jazz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mazzolin di Fiori . " Momma tapped her chin with her white glove and hummed appreciatively . While she picked at her whitefish and sipped her white wine and peeped around the restaurant from under the shadow of the red bird that forever ate cherries on her hat , Momma observed an American sergeant wrestling with an American black market steak . He was quite drunk , and to Momma , who knew all the symptoms so well , he seemed ready to cry . She debated inviting him to her table and treating him to his lunch . But he gave her the I-hateItaliansscowl , so she thought better of it . He was n't the sort who came to her bar anyhow . Momma was basically shy , except with people she thought needed affection . Then she 'd open up like all the great hostesses of the world . However , she did take out of herp129purse a little pasteboard card advertising her bar . She sent it by a waiter over to the sergeant , plus a bottle of Chianti . He scowled at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than halfway . Then he tore up her card and began to guzzle her wine . She finished her lunch and smoked a cigarette . There seemed to be a rope about her neck pulled taut by all the evil fingers of the world . She wanted to go somewhere and have a good cry . She needed a friend . Poppa had never been close to her since , in the first year of their marriage , he discovered that she was n't going to be fertile , like all the other women of Italy . Momma had conceivedjust once . In her Fallopian tubes . After the medico had curetted her out and she 'd all but died , he 'd told her she could never have a child of her own . And Poppa in disgust had taken to politics and reading the papers . Momma 'd only begun to love again since the night in October , 1943 , when she 'd opened her bar in the Galleria Umberto ... . She arose from table and drew on her white gloves . As she walked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gilded mirror , a dumpy figure holding in its chin , a scudding straw hat under a bird chewing cherries . She knew that if she did n't get outside soon , she 'd bawl right there in front of the waiters , and the drama she 'd built up of a great lady would collapse forever . On Via Chiaia she debated what movie she 'd go to . Since she went every afternoon , she 'd seen them all . A few American films were beginning to dribble into Naples , and Momma 'd enjoyed Greer Garson or Ginger Rogers with an Italian sound track . Yet movies bored her unless there was lots of music and color . The truth was that she went every afternoon because she 'd nothing else to do ; she was just killing time till the hour to open her bar . She decided on the Cinema Regina Elena off Via Santa Brigida . She found a seat three-quarters of the way back from the screen , put on her glasses , and watched the show . It was an Italian film made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Momma was used to the tempo of American movies , so she found herself nodding . There was n't even anything worth crying over . She eased her feet out of their patent leather pumps , cursed the pinching of her girdle , and settled down . Sometimes she drew a peppermint patty out of her bag and sucked it thoughtfully . Every half-hour the lights came up for an intervallo ; the windows were opened , and people came in or out or changed their seats for various reasons . Momma 'd have liked an Allied soldier to be sitting beside her . But to these the cinemas of Naples were off limits because of thep130danger of typhus and because of certain nuisances they 'd committed in the dark just after the city fell . During the intervalli Momma stayed in her seat and smoked a cigarette . She was n't going to force her feet back into her pumps . The Italian film went on and on ; Momma fell asleep and dreamed in the moldy dark . Her dreams were always the same , of the boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality about them . They had an air of being tremendously wise , older than the human race . They understood one another , as though from France and New Zealand and America they all had membership cards in some occult freemasonry . And they had a refinement of manner , an intuitive appreciation of her as a woman . Their conversation was flashing , bitter , and lucid . More than other men they laughed much together , laughing at life itself perhaps . Momma 'd never seen anything like her boys . Some were extraordinarily handsome , but not as other men were handsome . They had an acuteness in their eyes and a predatory richness of the mouth as though they 'd bitten into a pomegranate . Momma dreamed that she was queen of some gay exclusive club . She awoke and glanced at her watch . It was time to go . She 'd seen almost nothing of the film . But she did n't care . She felt more rested than she did by Poppa 's side . A silver hammer in her heart kept tapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day would begin . She had the yearning hectic panic of a child going to a show . She shot her feet into her pumps . As the lights came up for the secondo tempo Momma left the theater . She looked a little disdainfully at the audience , contrasting it with what she 'd shortly be seeing . Peaked Neapolitan girls on the afternoon of their giorno di festa , holding tightly to the arms of their fidanzati wearing GI undershirts ; sailors of the Regia Marina and the Squadra Navale in their patched blue and whites ; housewives from the vichi and the off-limits areas who 'd come in with a houseful of children to peer at the screen and lose themselves in its shadowy life . Her patent leather pumps hurt Momma 's feet , but she sprinted up Santa Brigida . She turned left at Via Giuseppe Verdi . Once in the Galleria Momma all but flew . She wondered if she looked spruce , if her hat was chic . The Galleria was milling and humming , for all the bars opened within a few seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hour throughout a great city . Momma had a presentiment that today was going to be especially glamorous . The 163o shift of troie were coming into the arcade with thep131promptness of factory girls . From now until curfew time the Galleriawould be a concentrated fever of bargaining and merchandisingpeculiar to Naples in August , i944 . The rolling steel shutters of Momma 's bar were already up . Gaetano was polishing the mirrors . He greeted Momma and went back to thinking about his wife and thirteen children and how it was n't fair that a man who 'd never signed the Fascist tessera should live like a dog under the Allies . Vincenzo was wearing a spotted apron , so Momma lashed him with her tongue and forced him into the gabinetto to put on a fresh one . She stitched them up herself out of American potato bags . Momma also inspected the glassware , the taps on the wine casks , the alignment of the bottles . She was kilometers ahead of the sanitation standards set by the PBS surgeon and the provost marshal . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and counted her soldi . At this moment the old feeling of ecstasy returned . For Momma loved her bar : the mirrors in which everyone could watch everyone else , the shining Carrara marble , the urns for making caffe espresso . Behind her on the mirror she 'd fastened a price list . She offered excellent white wine , vermouth , and cherry brandy . She hoped soon to be licensed to sell gin and cognac , which were what the Allies really wanted . When stronger liquors were available , the tone of her place would go sky-high , along with the moods of her clientele . No one had yet turned up . Momma knew with racecourse certaintythe exact order in which her habitues came . Her patrons were of three types : some came only to look , some with a thinly veiled purpose of meeting someone else , some just happened in . A shadow cut the fierce light of the Galleria bouncing around the mirrors . It was Poppa treading warily and carrying his straw hat . Momma flinched . She had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dialect , she 'd refuse to answer . He had rings under his eyes , and through his brown teeth came the perfume of onions . Momma told him that there was half a chicken waiting in the frigidaire . But he seemed to want to talk . Momma got as peeved as though someone tried to explain a movie to her . So Poppa , after a few more attempts to talk , put on his straw hat and went out . But he called back to her from the entrance :  --  Attenzione , cara . . . .  --  Perche ? Momma cried , but he was gone . Nettled and distracted , she settled herself behind the cash registerand folded her hands . Where were they ? All behind schedule to/night . She began to wonder if some of the other bar owners had sabotaged her by passing around the rumor that she was selling methyl alcohol such as would cause blindness . The husky figure of a major entered the bar . Momma smelled a rat because this major was wearing the crossed pistols of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inverted chamber pot with the inset blue star , symbolizing the Peninsular Base Section . The major set his jaw like one asking for trouble . He ran his hands through some of the wineglasses and blew on the wine spigots for dust.  --  Ees clean the glass , the wine , everything ! Momma cried cheerily . Bar molto buono , molto pulito ... . The major advanced upon her . She was beginning to tremble behind her desk . He walked with the burly tread of one accustomed to cuff and kick . Momma remembered that some of the Germans , when they 'd been in Naples , had walked like that.  --  Lissen to me , signorina , the major said , dropping a porky hand on her desk.  --  Signora , scusi , said Momma with dignity.  --  I do n't give a damn one way or the other , the major said . But do n't try an play dumb with me , see , paesan ?  --  Ees molto buono my bar , Momma twittered , offering the major a cigarette . Vincenzo and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my eye . You 're gettin away with murder in this joint . . . . Now you can just take your choice . Either you get rid of most of the people who come here , or we 'll put you off limits . And you know we damn well can , do n't you ? Momma quailed as she lit the major 's cigarette . The words " off limits " were understood by any Neapolitan who wanted to keep his shop open . Nothing could withstand the MP 's closing a place , unless you were friendly with some colonel of PBS.  --  You know as well as I do , said the major . An old doll like yourselfai n't as dumb as she looks . We do n't want any more Eyeties comin in here to mix with the soldiers . Do I make myself clear ? And you got ta refuse to serve some of the other characters . . . . Do n't come whinin around that you ai n't been warned . Momma motioned to Vincenzo and Gaetano to bring out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorites shots after closing time . It was set at the major 's elbow . He drank it off , glaringat her the while , set down the glass with a click , and left.  --  Capeesh ? he cried as he belched like a balloon out into the sunlight of the Galleria.  |p133Momma  could n't decide what grudge the MP 's had against her . There had been occasional fights in her bar , yet the other bars of Naples had even more of them . Her soldiers were gentle . All she was trying to do was run a clean bar where people could gather with other congenial people . Her crowd had something that other groups had n't . Momma 's boys had an awareness of having been born alone and sequestered by some deep difference from other men . For this she loved them . And Momma knew something of those four freedoms the Allies were forever preaching . She believed that a minority should be let alone ... . In came the Desert Rat . He took off his black beret and pushed a hand through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Momma and bought his quota of six chits for double white wines . It would take him three hours to drink these . He was always the first to arrive and the last to leave . He never spoke to a soul . He was the handsomest and silentest boy Momma 'd ever seen . Why did he come at all ? His manners were so perfect and soft that at a greetingfrom another , he 'd reply and recede into himself . Momma wondered if at Tobruk or El Alamein someone in the desert night had cut his soul to pieces . He 'd loved once  --  perfectly  --  someone , somewhere . Momma would cheerfully have slain whoever had hurt him so . The face of the Desert Rat was an oval of light brown . His short-sleeved shirt showed the cleft in his neck just above the hair of his chest . He wore the tightest and shortest pair of shorts he could get into , and he leaned lost and dreaming against the bar with his ankles scraping one another in their low socks and canvas gaiters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rat for Momma  --  the long firm legs of Germans , but tanned and covered from thigh to calf with thick soft hair . For three hours this English boy would stand in Momma 's bar , doped and dozing in maddening relaxation and grace from the white wine . Momma tore six chits out of the cash register and gave the Desert Rat four lire back out of his one hundred . Tonight she went so far as to pat his wrist , a thing she 'd been longing to do for months.  --  Ees warm tonight , no ?  --  Oh very , madam , the Desert Rat said . It was the first time she 'd seen his smile . And Momma suddenly saw him in someone 's arms by moonlight in the Egyptian desert , in the midst of that love which had sliced the boy 's heart in two . ... He left her and went to the bar . In the next three hours it was usually at him that Momma 'd look when she was n't makingp134change . She saw him from all perspectives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . Next to arrive was a Negro second lieutenant of the American quartermaster corps . Momma smiled to herself as the Negro made an entrance . He seemed to have the idea he was stepping onto some lighted stage . He moved his hips ever so slightly and carriedhis pink-insided hands tightly against his thighs . For some dramatic reason he wore combat boots , though Momma knew he 'd never been farther north than the docks of Naples.  --  Hulllllo , darling , he said to Momma , kissing her fingers . He had a suave overeducated voice . You look simpppply wonderful tonight . Who does your hats ? Queen Mary ? . . . Uh-huh , uh-huh , uh-huh ... . Then he stationed himself at the bar quite close to the Desert Rat . They looked at each other for a swift appraising instant . Then the Negro lieutenant began to talk a blue streak at the Desert Rat.  --  It 's going to be brilliant here tonight , absolutely brrrrilliant . I feel it way down inside . . . . My aunt , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But do you think I 'm ever going back there ? No , indeed , baby . I found a home in Italy , where the human plant ca n't help but thrive . I like the Italians , you know . They 're like me , refined animals , which of course does n't bar the utmost in subtlety and human development . . . . They talk about French love . . . . Well , the Italians know all the French do , and have a tenderness besides . . . . My God , why does n't everybody just live for love ? That 's all there is , baby . And out of bed you have to be simply brillllllliant ... . Momma sometimes pondered to herself the reason for the wild rhetoric talk by some of the people who came to her bar . It was n't like Italian rhetoric , which makes good Italian conversation a sort of shimmering badminton . At Momma 's most of her customers talked like literate salesmen who cunningly invited you out to dinner  --  all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propaganda was sparkling and insidious . At Momma 's there were people who talked constantly for the whole three hours . There were others who simply listened to the talkers , smiling and accepting , as though they 'd tacitly agreed to play audience . And Momma could tell the precise time in her bar by the level of the noise , by the speed with which the words shot through the air like molten needles , by the ever mounting bubbles of laughter and derision . Under this conversation Momma sensed a vacuum ofp135pain , as though her guests jabbered at one another to get their minds off themselves , to convince themselves of the reality of something or other . There now arrived the only two Momma did n't rejoice to see , two British sergeants wearing shorts draped like an old maid 's flannels . They were almost twins , had peaked noses and spectacles that caused them to peer at everyone as though they were having difficulty in threading a needle from their rocking chairs . Momma wished they would n't stand so close to her desk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar closed . Their conversation was a series of laments and groans and criticisms of everyone else present . They called this dishing the joint . Momma thought that they came to her bar because they could n't stay away . They were disdainful and envious and balefully curious all at the same time . They reminded her of old women who take out their false teeth and contemplate their photograph of forty years ago . These sergeantsbought some chits , took off their berets , and primped a little in the mirror behind Momma.  --  Esther , my coiffure ! Used to be so thick and lustrous .... We 're not getting any younger , are we ? We 'll have to start paying for it soon . Shall we live together and take in tatting ? And the other sergeant said , giving himself a finger wave :  --  Well , I 've read that the end of all this is exhaustion and ennui . As we 've agreed steen times before , Magda , the problem is bottomless , simply bottomless . No one but ourselves understands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand into a cleft tree to your own peril , Magda . When you take out the wedge , the tree snaps together and breaks your hand . . . . And you cry your eyes out at night , but it does n't do any good . . . . It keeps coming back on you because it 's in you . Even though you do n't get any satisfaction , you go back to it like a dog to his vomit . . . . That 's what it is , Magda , vomit . Why kid ourselves and talk of love ? Love is a constructive force . . . . We only want to destroy ourselves in others because we hate ourselves ... . At 1700 hours Rhoda appeared after she 'd had evening chow at the WAC-ery . Rhoda was the only woman who came to Momma 's bar . No one ever spoke to Rhoda , who did her drinking standing at the far end of the counter , reading a thick book . She always made it a point to show Momma what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . She studied theories of leisure classes and patterns behind governments.  |  --  I 'm not good for much of anything , Rhoda once said , except to talk up a storm . To Momma 's Italian ear Rhoda had a voice like a baritone ; everything she said carried about a kilometer.  --  What am I ? Rhoda said once . The reincarnation of L'Aiglon . It seemed to Momma that Rhoda was happy in her WAC uniform  --  theneat tie , the coat , the stripes on the sleeve , the skirt that did n't call attention to the fact that it was a skirt . Under her overseascap Rhoda wore an exceptional hairdo . It was something like the pageboy bob of twenty years ago cut still more boyishly . And under this cropped poll were Rhoda 's stark face , thin lips , weasel eyes . Rhoda looked as though she were lying in ambush for something . She bought a slew of tickets from Momma and went to her accustomed place , reading and drinking . She turned the pages by moistening her forefinger and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhoda was the only American girl whom Momma knew well , but she was a symbol . Momma had a theory that romantic love was on the wane in America because if all the women were like Rhoda , American girls were mighty emancipated and intellectual . Since Rhoda was so cool and unfeminine , Momma foresaw a day in the United States when all the old graceful concepts of love would have perished . The women would have brought it on themselves by insistingon equality with the men . To Momma , thinking of her girlhoodin Milan , this was n't an inviting picture ... .  --  Why do n't signorine come here ? Rhoda asked authoritatively of Momma . Intellectual Italian women , I mean . I 'd spread the gospelto them . I 'm the best little proselytizer in the world . I 'd make them socially conscious . We 'd read the Nation and John Dos Passos . I might even pass out copies of Consumers ' Research to help Italian girls buy wisely . Momma smiled . She knew quite well that if signorine started coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . It was an easy matter to get a signorina anywhere else in the Galleria Umbertoor on the Toledo . Momma had indeed been ill at ease when Rhoda had first appeared , but the boys had accepted Rhoda while ignoring her . And so long as there was harmony , Momma did n't care who came to her bar . . . .  --  Oh this place of yours , Rhoda boomed with a thick shiver . It 's positively electric here , Momma . I get so much thinking andreading done in this stimulating atmosphere . . . . Just like a salon . The two British sergeants eyed Rhoda . Momma 'd been expect/ing them to accost one another for the past week . And tonight the bubble was going to burst.  --  We 've been asking one another why you come here , the sergeantcalled Esther said . You must have a Saint Francis of Assisi complex . Or else you 're a Messalina . . . . If you want to give us a good laugh , why do n't you bring one of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You should n't come here alone , darling . Momma 's bar is like nature , which abhors vacuums and solitary people.  --  I 'm not answerable to the likes of you , Rhoda roared back , bristling with delight . But I will say I 've always sought out milieux that vibrate in tune with me .... So you two just get back to your knitting . Just because you two are jaded and joaded , that 's no sign I should be too.  --  Magda , she 's a tigress , the other British sergeant said , but a veritable tigress . We must have her to our next Caserta party.  --  Do n't think I do n't know those parties , Rhoda rumbled . The height of sterility . Everybody sits around tearing everybody else to pieces , thinking , My God , ai n't we brilliant . Everybody gets stinkingdrunk . Then somebody makes an entrance down the stairs in ostrich feathers and a boa . . . . No thank you , my pretty chicks.  --  Well , get you , Mabel , the first British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the turn things were taking by her cash desk . It was as though the three were armed with talons , raking at one another 's faces.  --  We understand one another all too well , do n't we ? Rhoda said triumphantly . I pity you two from the bottom of my swelling heart . If you had a little more of what I have , or I had a little more of what you have , what beautiful music we could make . . . a trio ... .  --  Darling , I see you in London , the second sergeant said . A sensation . But you are n't quite Bankhead , darling . But you are happy in the WAC 's , are n't you , dear ? Your postwar plans are to run a smart little night club ... wearing a white tuxedo . . . but darling , you just have n't the figger for it.  --  It 's no use trying to scratch my eyes out , Rhoda rumbled in her open diapason . I have a perfect armorplating against elderly queans.  --  Pleasa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... . In her bar things moved by fits and starts . Incidents in the courseof three hours followed some secret natural rhythm of fission andquiescence , like earthquakes and Vesuvio . Each time the climaxesp138grew fuller . This first was only a ripple to what she knew would happen later . Rhoda and the two British sergeants glared at one another . She reopened her thick book and retreated into it like an elephant hulking off into the jungle . The two sergeants put arms about each other 's waists and executed a little congratulatory dance . After the first incident the Desert Rat raised his fine dark head , looked into the mirror , and ordered another white wine . The Negro second lieutenant stopped his monologue and called out :  --  Everyone 's still wearing their veil . . . but wait ... . An Italian contingent always came to Momma 's on schedule . They entered with the furtive gaiety of those who know they are n't wanted , but have set their hearts on coming anyhow . They wore shorts and sandals and whimsical little coats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put their arms into the sleeves . Momma knew that her Allied clientele did n't care for them . And besides they never drank more than two glasses apiece , if they drank that much . They just sat around and mimicked one another and sniggered and looked hard at the Allied soldiery . Each evening they had a fresh set of photos and letters to show one another . Momma thought of nothing so much as a bevy of Milan shopgirls having a reunion after the day 's work . She knew them all so well . The Italians treated Momma with a skeptical deference , as though to say , Well , here we are again , dearie ; your bar is in the public domain ; so what are you going to do with us if we do n't make a nuisance of ourselves ? There was Armando , who worked in a drygoods store . He was led in by his shepherd dog on a leather thong . This dog was Armando 's lure for introduction to many people . He had tight curls like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an air of distinction learned from the films . He wore powder-blue shorts . It was Armando who translated all his little friends ' English letters for them . There was Vittorio , with the blue eyes of a doll and gorgeous clothes such as Momma 'd seen on young ingegneri in the old days in Milan . Vittorio worked as a typist at Navy House on Via Caracciolo . He worked so well and conscientiously that the British gave him soap and food rations . Sunday afternoons he walked by the aquarium with an English ensign who murmured in his ear . Vittoriohad arrogance and bitterness . He was the leader of the others . All evening long at Momma 's he lectured on literature and life and the sad fate of handsome young Neapolitans in Naples of August , 1944 . In Momma 's hearing he said that he 'd continue hisp139present career till he was thirty . Then he 'd marry a contessa and retire to her villa at Amalfi . There was Enzo , who 'd been a carabiniere directing traffic until the Allies had liberated Naples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strolling the town in a T-shirt , inviting his friends to coffee in the afternoon , and singing at dusk in dark corners . Momma thought Enzo the apogee of brutal refinement . Over his shorts he wore shirts of scented silk or pongee . Under these the muscles of his back shimmered like salmon . The nostrils in his almost black face showed like pits , flaring with his breathing . There was also a tiny sergente maggiore of the Italian Army . He held himself off from the rest , though he always came in with them . He used them as air-umbrella protection for his own debarkingoperations . The name of this sergente maggiore was Giulio . His eyes darted warily about , and once in a while he 'd call out something in a barking voice , to show that he was accustomed to command . He insisted on wearing his smart fascist peaked cap , the visor of which he would nervously tug when he got an unexpected answer . The last Italian to arrive at Momma 's was the only one she respected . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only as Gianni . Besides his title he had a spacious apartment in the Vomero . Momma respected his rank , and she hoped some day to be presented to his mother the countess . Momma liked Gianni as a person too . He was always dressed in black , with a white stiff collar and a black knitted tie . His black eyes smoldered with a remote nostalgia . For some months now he 'd come to Momma 's drunk a little , and gone away . But tonight he seemed purposeful . He greeted Momma with a tender wretchedness . Momma knew his disease . He was a Neapolitan conte , dying of love . Gianni avoided the other Italians , who had perched themselves on a counter at the rear of the bar , and went straight up to the Desert Rat . Momma leaned over her cash desk and watched with popping eyes.  --  May I speak to you , sir ? Gianni said to the Desert Rat . His English was as slow and exquisite as that melancholy that lay over him like a cloud.  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his almost inaudible voice.  --  Do you like me a little , sir ? The Desert Rat did n't answer , but his tall body stiffened.  --  I had a friend once , Gianni said , almost crying . He was a German officer . He taught me German , you see . He was kind to me.  |p140And  I think I was kind to him . I think I am a good person , sir . I am a rich count , but of course to you that does not import .... I seek nothing from you , sir . . . like the others . . . . You look so much like the German officer . I was happy with him . He said he was happy with me . . . . Would you like sometimes to come to my house in the Vomero , sir ? The two British sergeants set up a screaming like parrots . Gianni fled . Momma put her hand to her heart , which had given one vast jump . The Desert Rat quietly put down his wineglass . He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he ran out through the bar . Momma watched him stand outside , peeringup and down the Galleria and shielding his eyes against the sun . After a while he returned to his place and fell into his old reverie . He seemed as stirred and angry as a true and passionate boy . The two British sergeants were shrieking and sobbing and looking at their reddened faces in the mirror . Then they repaired to the gabinetto . Momma could hear them inside splashing water on their faces and gibbering like chickens being bathed by a hen . Rhoda looked over her book at the silent Desert Rat . The second incident rolled through the bar like the aftertones of a bell . Momma just held onto her cash register and prayed , for she knew that this was going to be an evening . The Negro second lieutenant began to sing something about " Strange Fruit . " The Italians footnoted the incident to one another . Momma 's bar was n't nearly full yet , but it was buzzing like a bomb . Presently the two British sergeants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their eyes flushed from weeping . They looked like hawks for someone to prey on . Enzo stepped easily up to them , placed a hand on his hip , and extended his powerful jeweled hand :  --  Buona sera , ragazze.  --  You go straight to hell ! the first British sergeant screeched . Why do you come here at all , you sordid little tramps in your dirty old finery ? Do you think we feel sorry for you ? Go on Via Roma and peddle your stuff and stop trying to act like trade . . . . We see through you , two-shilling belles . All of you get out , do you hear ? Nobody here wants anything you 've got . The Allies are quite selfsufficient , thank you . We did all right before Naples fell . . . . Why the nerve of you wop queans ! Glamor ! ? Why you 've all got as much allure as Gracie Fields in drag . . . . Go find some drunken Yank along the port . . . . But get the hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the British sergeants in their own indirect but effective way . Momma decided that the Italians were more deeply rooted in life , that they accepted themselves . For the Italian contingent merely sent up a merry carol of laughter . If they 'd had fans , they 'd have retreated behind them . This laughterhad n't a hollow ring . It was based on the assumption that anything in life can be laughed out of existence . Momma had never admired the Italian element in her bar . Now she did . They shook with the silveriest laughter , lolling over one another like cats at play . Their limbs gleamed in their shorts . Even the tiny sergente maggiore joined in the badinage . And the two British sergeants stepped back by Momma 's cash desk and resumed their jeremiad.  --  What will become of us , Esther ? When we were young , we could laugh off the whole business . You and I both know that 's what camping is . It 's a Greek mask to hide the fact that our souls are being castrated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a seduction at twelve goes on till we 're senile old aunties , doing it just as a reflex action ... .  --  And we 're at the menopause now , Magda. . . . 0 God , if some hormone would just shrivel up in me and leave me in peace ! I hate the thought of making a fool of myself when I turn forty . I 'll see something gorgeous walking down Piccadilly and I 'll make a pass and all England will read of my trial at the Old Bailey ... . Do you think we would have been happier in Athens , Magda ?  --  Esther , let 's face facts . You ca n't argue yourself out of your own time and dimension . You and I do n't look like the Greeks and we do n't think like them . We were born in England under a late Victorian morality , and so we 'll die . . . . The end is the same anyhow , Greek or English . Do n't you see , Esther ? We 've spent our youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us is ever at peace with herself . All bitchery adds up to an attempt to get away from yourself by playing a variety of poses , each one more gruesome and leering than the last .... I 'm sick to death of it , Esther . I can think of more reasons for not havingbeen born than I can for living . . . . Is there perhaps some nobility stirring in my bones ?  --  Then is there no solution , Magda ? the second British sergeant asked wistfully . He cast his eyes about the bar like a novice about to take the veil.  --  Millions , Esther . But rarely in the thing itself . That 's what tantalizes us all . We play with the thing till it makes of us whatp142we swear we 'll never become , cold-blooded sex machines , dead to love . There are so many ways of sublimating , Esther . . . . But are they truly satisfying either ? For some hours I 've known , though they 'll never come again , I 'd cheerfully pass all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's the hell of it . We all have known moments , days , weeks that were perfect.  --  All part of the baggage of deceit , Esther . God lets us have those moments the way you 'd give poisoned candy to a child . And we look back on those wonderful nights with far fiercer resentment than an old lady counting the medals of her dead son.  --  But we 've had them , Magda ; we 've had them . No one can take them away from us . The two British sergeants lapsed into silence , for which Momma was grateful . Their conversation was a long swish of hissing s 's and flying eyebrows . They began to scratch their chevrons in a troubled and preoccupied way , and their faces fell into the same sort of introspectiveemptiness that Momma 'd observed on old actresses sitting alone in a cafe . There was a lost air about them that made her prefer not to look at them , as though the devil had put her a riddle admitting of no solution , and a forfeit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Momma 's bar , the time of the breathing spell . She was quite aware that , gathered under her roof and drinking her white wine and vermouth , there was a great deal of energy that did n't quite know how to spend itself . And since there 's some rhythm in life , in bars , and in war , everybody at once stopped talking and ordered fresh drinks . She could see them all looking at their wrist watches and telling themselves : I have another hour to go  --  what will it bring me ? Momma 's sixth sense told her there was trouble brewing . A group of soldiers and sailors entered her bar . From the way they shot around their half-closed eyes she knew that this was n't the place for them . They had an easiness and a superiority about them as though they were looking for trouble with infinite condescension . Cigars lolled from their mouths.  --  Gracious , the Negro second lieutenant said , men !  --  Look , Esther , said the first of the British sergeants , look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What we seek and can never have . ... And each side hates the other . The twain never meet except in case of necessity . And they part with tension on both sides . For there were two American parachutists who lounged insolently , taking up more cubic space than they should have . Andp143with them were two drunken American sailors , singing and holdingone another up . Momma now wished that Poppa were here to order this foursome out summarily , under threat of the MP 's . Vincenzo and Gaetano were no help at all in such circumstances . Then what she feared happened . Someone of her regular clientele let up a soft scream like a pigeon being strangled . At once a parachutist stiffened , flipped a wrist , and bawled :  --  Oh saaaay , Nellie ! This was the moment the Italians had been waiting for . They picked themselves off the flat-topped counter where they 'd been idling and padded toward the four newcomers . They were cajoling and tender and satiric and gay . They lit cigarettes for the parachutistsand the sailors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballet of hands and light and rippling voices and the thickened accents of the sailors and the parachutists.  --  Jesus , baby , those bedroom eyes ! someone said to Vittorio.  --  I hateya and I loveya , ya beast , one of the sailors said.  --  Coo , it teases me right out of my mind , one of the Britishsergeants said . So simple and complex . Masculine and feminine . All gradations and all degrees and all nuances.  --  The basis of life and love and cruelty and death , said the other British sergeant , looking as though he would faint . And in the long run , Magda , who is master and who mistress ? From a tension that was surely building up , Momma was distracted by the appearance of an assorted horde . In the final hour of the evening her bar filled until there were forty wedged in , six to eight deep from the mirrors to the bar . Her eyes had a mad skipping time to follow all that went on . It was like trying to watch a circus with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came an Aussie in a fedora hat , to which his invention had added flowers and feathers . Tonight he was more than usually drunk . He slunk in with the slow detachment of a mannequin modeling clothes . He waved a lace handkerchief at all :  --  Oh my pets , my pets ! Your mother 's awfully late tonight , but she 'll try and make it up to you !  --  Ella 's out of this world , some one said . She 's brilliant , brilliant . A glazed look came over the sailors ' eyes like snakes asleep . Ella the Aussie kissed their hands and bustled off while they were still collecting themselves.  --  Do n't call me your sister ! Ella shrieked , waving at his public while buying chits from Momma . He kissed Momma on both her cheeks , leaving a stench of alcohol and perfume.  |p144There  was a rich hollow thud . Momma at first feared that someone had planted a fist on someone else 's chin . But it was only Rhoda , the WAG corporal , closing her book . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too crowded in there even to turn pages . Next to appear at Momma 's was a British marine , sullen in his red and black , with a hulking beret . Momma knew he was a boxer , but not the sort who made trouble . He 'd a red slim face , pockmarkedand dour ; the muscles in his calves stood out like knots . While drinking he teetered up and down on his toes and was a master at engineering newcomers into conversation . He observed everyone with a cool devotion . Often he 'd invited Momma to his bouts at the Teatro delle Palme , but she had n't gone because she coud n't bear to see him beating and being beaten in the ring . This British marine was on the most basic and genial terms with himselfand the world . Next came a plump South African lance corporal with red pips , and a Grenadier Guardsman , tall and reserved and mustached . The South African lance corporal was a favorite of Momma 's because he made so much of her . She knew he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremony was so much fun to her.  --  Old girl , I 've finally got married , said the plump lance corporal , presenting her to the Grenadier Guardsman , who looked terrified and bulwarky at the same time . This is Bert . You 'll love Bert . He save my life in Tunisia . And he understands me . So he 's not as stupid as he looks . And his devotion , darling ! Coo ! Just like a Saint Bernard Bert is . He knows how to cook , you know ... . Bert 's essence is in his mustaches . The traditionalism , the stolidity , and the stupidity of the British people produced those mustaches of Bert 's . Momma was in such a whirl of happiness that she gave the guardsman a chit for a drink on the house . Meanwhile the South African lance corporal whirled about the bar , burbling to everyoneand formally announcing his marriage to Bert . Momma was beginning to believe that she was n't going to have any trouble from the parachutists and the sailors . They and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Momma tried to spell out for herself some theory of good and evil , but the older she got and the more she saw , the less clear cut the boundaries became to her . She could only conclude that these boys who drank at her bar were exceptional human beings . The masculine and the feminine were n't nicely divided in Momma 's mind as they are top145a biologist . They overlapped and blurred in life . This trait was what kept life and Momma 's bar from being black and white . If everything were so clear cut , there 'd be nothing to learn after the age of six and arithmetic . Among the later comers to Momma 's were certain persons from the port battalion that sweated loading and unloading ships in the Bay of Naples . They turned up in her bar in the Galleria Umbertoas soon as the afternoon shift got off , just as the truck drivers make a beeline for coffee and doughnuts . They usually came with fatigues damp with their sweat , with green-visored caps askew on their knotted hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the MP 's . But some of these port battalion GI 's were Momma 's favorites since they brought her many odds and ends they 'd taken from the holds of Liberty ships : tidbits destined for generals ' villas and the like . They knew Momma 's nature as a curio collector of things and people . There was Eddie , an American corporal . Momma loved Eddie the way she 'd love a child of her own who was born not quite all there . Eddie 'd been a garage mechanic in Vermont . He squirmed with that twisted tenderness often acquired by people who spend their lives lying under motors and having axle grease drip on them . Eddie had misty lonely eyes ; his mouth was that of one who has never made the transition out of babyhood . His red hair yielded to no comb , and there was always a thick mechanical residue under his fingernails , which Momma sometimes cleaned herself . Eddie was drunk on duty and off . As he bought his chits , he leaned over Momma and patted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Momma asked  --  Bene , bene , Momma , he replied . Eddie would caress people in a soft frightened way and then run his tongue over his lips . After he 'd got good and tight , he 'd go through the crowded bar playing games , pulling neckties , snapping belt buckles , and thrusting his knee between people 's legs . He was like a little dog that has got mixed up in society and desires to find a master . Then there was a supply sergeant of the port battalion , with his vulture face . His every movement seemed to Momma a raucous suppression of some deeper inferiority sense . He talked constantly like a supply catalogue , reeling off lists of things in his warehouse for the potent music of their names . Then he would shoot out his jaw and the blood would capillate into his eyes . Momma got him rooms around Naples with spinster acquaintances of hers . He stayed in these rooms on his one night off a week . This sergeant loved to sally into off-limits areas and wet-smelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all there is to life , baby . . . . Eddie meanwhile had drunk three glasses of vermouth and came and stood by Momma , slipping cakes of soap into her hand behind the cash desk.  --  Jees , I tink I got da scabies , Momma .. . The last delegate from the port battalion was one of its tech sergeants named Wilbur . He treated Momma like a serving girl and spent his time going over everyone with his eyes . Wilbur should have been born a lynx , for he draped his length over any available area with a slow rehearsed lewdness . Tonight he was growing a mustache , but it did n't camouflage his violet eyes that glowed like amethysts in his face . Momma could never get him to look her in the eyes . He simply drawled at everyone , and all the things he said lay around in gluey pools like melted lavender sherbet.  --  Bonsoir , ducks , Wilbur said to the two British sergeants . When is all this blah going to end ? Because it is blah , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Done any one nice lately ? What a town to cruise this is . All the belles in the States would give their eyeteethto be in Naples tonight . And when they saw all there is here , they 'd be so confused they would n't know what to do with it . . . . Can you imagine the smell of their breaths ? . . . Blah , that 's all it is . Two of Momma 's more distinguished patrons now entered from the Galleria . They did it every evening , but every evening a little hush fell over the drinkers . They came in a little flushed , as though they 'd been surprised in a closet . Perhaps the momentary pall proceeded from a certain awe at their rank , or at their temerity in coming at all . For by now the party was well under way , susceptible to that hiatus in levels of euphoria when people come late to a group that is already from alcohol in a state of dubious social cohesion . One was a pasty-faced major of the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month and got his dentist friends to clean her teeth gratis . The major 's breath always boiled in an asthmatic fashion , as though he were in the last stages of love-making . With him was his crony , a not so young second lieutenant who 'd been commissioned for valor in combat at Cassino . The major and the lieutenant both wore gold wedding bands on their fingers . Momma gathered that they pre/ferred not to discuss their wives , since these little women were four thousand miles away.  --  Poor pickins tonight , said the major to the lieutenant.  --  I do n't waste any time any more , the lieutenant grunted , paying for his chits . I just say do you and pushem into a dark corner ... . Piss on all introductions and flourishes . . . . Who started this way anyhow ? Not me , buddy ... . Momma looked at the half-bald head of the lieutenant under the crazy angle of his cap . She knew that he 'd been most heroic in battle  --  that was how he 'd got his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once he 'd told her of last winter in battle , of an Italian boy sewing by moonlight in the arch of a bombed house near Formia :  --  I was drinking vino with my GI 's . . . . And he just sits there looking at me . Fifteen , he said he was . . . white skin . I remember his eyes over his needle . . . . I wonder where he is now . As the lieutenant fumbled to pay her for their chits , a woman 's picture fell on Momma 's counter out of his pocket :  --  Fes your wife in Stati Uniti ? Momma said , trying to turn the glossy print over . He covered it from her gaze with a hand pocked with sandfly bites and umber with cigarette stains . His eyes were close to hers , yellow and protruding.  --  Never mind that , Momma , he said , restoring the picture to his pocket . Momma knew that the bravest and coolest entered her bar alone . They entered with a curt functionalism that informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch or to brood . Still others came in specious twosomes , talked together a little , and spent most of the time ignoring one another and looking into the mirrors in a sort of reconnoitering restlessness . And a few came in groups of twos and threes for protection . When Momma 's bar was full , it was like a peacock 's tail because she could see nothing but eyes through the cigarette smoke . Restless and unsocketed eyes that wheeled all around , wholly taken up in the business of looking and calculating . Eyes of every color . Momma 's bar when crowded was a goldfish bowl swimming with retinas and irises in motion . Next there came two French lieutenants and two French sailors . The sailors were ubriachi and the lieutenants were icily sober . In the two French officers Momma 'd always noted an excellence in the little braided pips through their shoulder loops , their American khaki shirts , and their tailored shorts , Their conversation playedp148over the heads of their sailors with a silvery irony . Momma understoodtheir tongue decently enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality beyond even the intelligence of the speakers.  --  Ainsi je noie toute mon angoisse , said the first French officer.  --  C'est ma femme qui m'incite a de telles folies , said the other.  --  Tilimbom , the drunken sailors said , clapping the pompons on their caps . The French officers had a jeep which they parked at the steps of the Galleria . When Momma closed her bar , she knew that they whisked into this jeep an assorted and sparkling company and drove to the top of Naples to admire the August moonlight . Momma wondered if the ripple of their epigrams and refinements ceased even when they were making love.  --  C'est une manie , Pierre.  --  Bon appetit , Andre . Momma had less than half an hour till closing time . Her bar , into which people now must wedge themselves , was swimming in smoke and a terrific tempo of talk and innuendo . Under its surface there was a force of madness and a laughter of gods about to burst . Momma put her hand to her throat and swallowed hard in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For this was the time she loved best of her three hours : a presentiment of infinite possibilities , of hectic enchantments , of the fleeting moment that never could be again because it was too preposterous and frantic and keyed up . The Desert Rat was finishing his fifth white wine in his prison of detachment and musing . Ella the Aussie was being removed by Gaetano and Vincenzo from the top of the bar , where he was executing a cancan . Rhoda was booming out a quotation from Spengler . The Negro second lieutenant was examining his nail polish . Eddie had put his arms around one of the French officers , talking about parlayvoo-fransay . And the two British sergeants reared up like Savonarolas.  --  I 'm asking you , Esther , to take a good look at all these mad people . For they are mad . And consider the subtle thread that brings them all together here . Not so subtle as that either , Esther , since their personalities are so deeply rooted in it . What an odd force to unite so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and when they 've had it , their reactions will be different . Some will feel themselves defiled . Others will want another try atp149it . Others will feel that they have n't found what they were looking for and will be back here tomorrow night.  --  Does either of us know what these people are looking for , Magda ? the second sergeant asked with thickened tongue.  --  Do n't be dull , Esther . They 're all looking for perfection .. . and perfection is a love of death , if you face the issue squarely . That 's the reason why these people live so hysterically . Since the desire to live , in its truest sense of reproducing , is n't in them , they live for the moment more passionately than most . That makes them brazen and shortsighted . . . . In this life , Esther , when you find perfection , you either die on the spot in orgasm , or else you do n't know what to do with it . . . . These people are the embodiment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a taut string contains a musical note . They 're the race 's own question mark on its value to survive.  --  Is there any hope for them , Magda ? the second sergeant whimpered , wiping a mist from his glasses.  --  In the exact measure that they believe in themselves , Esther . Depending on how they control their centripetal desires . Some hold back in their minds and distrust what they 're doing . In them are the seeds of schizophrenia and destruction . Others give themselves wholly up to their impulses with a dizziness and a comic sense that are revolting to the more serious ones . . . . Lastly there 's a group which sees that they can profit by everything in this world . These are the sane . The Orientals are wiser in these matters than we or Queen Victoria . No phase of human life is evil in itself , provided the whole does n't grow static or subservient to the part . . . . But beware , Esther , of the bright psychiatrists who try to demarcate clearly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered themselves to be burnt as witches because it gave them such satisfaction to keep up their act . It was just a harmless expression of their ego . And children allow themselves to be pinked by hot stoves just to get a little sympathy out of their parents.  --  What does God think of all this , Magda ? mourned the second sergeant.  --  Thank Him , if He exists , that we do n't know . . . . A new morality may come into existence in our time , Esther . That 's one of the few facts that thrills me , old bitch that I am . Some distinctionmay be made between public and private sins , between economicand ethical issues . In 1944 you find the most incredible intermingling , a porridge of the old and the new , of superstition and enlightenment . How can we speak of sin when thousands arep150cremated in : German furnaces , when it is n't wrong to make a million pounds , but a crime to steal a loaf of bread ? Perhaps some new code may come out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not ?  --  Why then , the first British sergeant said in drunken triumph , we shall have a chaos far worse than in Momma 's bar this evening . This is merely a polite kind of anarchy , Esther . These people are expressing a desire disapproved of by society . But in relation to the world of 1944 , this is just a bunch of gay people letting down their back hair . . . We must n't go mad over details , Esther . Big issues are much more important . It is they which should drive us insane if we must be driven at all . . . . All I say is , some compromise must and will be reached . . . . Esther , I 'm stinko . Momma watched the two British sergeants embrace each other with an acid tenderness . Then they slid to the floor unconscious , in a welter of battle dress and chevrons and spectacles . They lay with their eyes closed in the quiet bliss of two spinsters who have fought out their differences at whist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Momma 's at this time of the evening that no one paid any attention to the collapse , just pushed and wedged in closer to give the corpses room . The talk was now at its full tide of animation , like a river ravenous to reach the sea , yet a little apprehensive to lose its identity in that amorphous mass which ends everything . Momma knew the secret of an evening 's drinking , that life grows sweeter as the sun sets and one gets tighter . If only drinkers knew how to hold their sights on that yellow target bobbing on their horizons ! For Momma understood the drunkenness of the Nordic better than most Italians did . They drank out of impatience with details , with personalities that were centrifugal , with a certain feminine desire to have a crutch for the spirit , with a certain sluggishness of their metabolism . Momma thought it weak of them to drink , but it was a weakness as amiable as modesty , courtesy , or the desire to live at all when the odds were against them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and strained her ear at the hurtling shafts of talk :  --  How can you possibly like actors ? Every goddam one of them is constantly playing a part . Off the stage too . . .  --  I am essentially an aristocrat . People must come to me . But I 'm by no means passive . . .  --  My aunt , a refined colored woman , brought me up most cir/cumspectly . I come from a long line of missionaries . So do n't think I do n't spread the good word among the Gentiles .. .  --  I do n't know why our sort is always in the best jobs and the smartest .. .  --  First time for me , ya see . I 'm not the lowered-eyelash kind .. .  --  So I told this Nellie to go peddle her fish somewhere else . And she did .. .  --  Do you remember loathing your father and doting on your teachers ? . .. You did n't ? ...  --  ... not responsible for anything I do tonight ...  --  Il n'y a rien au @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I think this is the real thing , the bottom falls right out from under me . Here I go again .. .  --  ... un vero appassionato di quelle cose misteriose .. .  --  I could be faithful all night long ...  --  Ciao , cara ...  --  In the Pincio Gardens all I saw was flesh flesh flesh ...  --  Sometime we 'll read the Phaedo together . Then you 'll see what I mean ...  --  There 's somethin in ya eyes . I du n no , I just know when I 'm happy ...  --  Let 's you and me stop beating around the bush ...  --  Do n't feel you have to be elegant with me , Bella , cause your tiara 's slippin over one ear ...  --  For Chrissakes , what in hell do ya take me for ? ...  --  They 're all suckin for a bruise . . . or somethin else .. .  --  ... am frankly revolted with the spectacle of human beings with their bobbie pins flying all over the place ...  --  And when they expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tink da Eyetalians is a hunnert years behind da times ...  --  Why do I wear a tie ? Just to be different , that 's why ...  --  ... simply no idea of the effect of Mozart coming over a loudspeakerat the edge of the desert . The Krauts simply lovedddd ittt ! .. .  --  In a society predominantly militaristic ...  --  Ciao , cara ...  --  I looked at you earlier ... but I did n't dare think .. . A sudden silence descended on Momma 's bar . There was a movement of many bodies giving way to make space . She now knew exactly what time it was and who had come . It was Captain Joep152and the young Florentine . This was the climax of every evening . Captain Joe stalked cool and somber in his tank boots , a green bandanna tucked round his neck in the negligence of magnificence . He had gold hair which caught the light like bees shuttling at high noon . He had a hard intense sunburned face that smoldered like a monk in a Spanish painting . Momma knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle and courteous with all . He came only in the company of the young Florentine , whose eyes never ' . eft his face . The captain smiled with amusement and understandingat all , but he spoke only to his friend . Their faces complemented one another as a spoon shapes what it holds . The Florentine had dark thoughtful eyes and olive skin . He seemed wholly selfless . He and Captain Joe shared a delight and a comprehension that could n't be heard . But they gave out a peace , a wild tranquillity.  --  Buona sera a Lei , said Captain Joe to Momma . You keep a great circus at Naples , signora . And the miraculous thing about you is that you do n't need the whip of a ringmaster . . . . You and I and Orlando are the last of a vanishing tribe . We live in the sunshineof our own nobility . A perilous charge in these days . I wonder if our time will ever come again . We give because we have to . And others try to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defects into our virtues . Momma signaled to Vincenzo and Gaetano to shut down the rolling steel shutter . It was closing time . Captain Joe lit her cigarette.  --  Happiness , Captain Joe said , is a compromise , signora , between being what you are and not hurting others . . . . We smile , Orlando and I. . . . Genius knows its own weaknesses and hammers them into jewels . All our triumphs come from within . We 've never learned to weep . . . A shout , a thud , and screams tore the air.  --  Ya will , willya ! a drunken voice roared , hoarse with murder . Fists began to fly and people retreated against the walls . There was kicking and petitioning and cursing . The Desert Rat roused from his torpor and leaped in to defend the fallen . In the narrow bar persons swirled back and forth in a millrace . There were bloody noses and snapping joints . And when Momma saw the MP 's break in from the Galleria , flailing their night sticks , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So almost effortlessly she fell out and across her cash desk . She 'd been practicing mentally all eveninglong.  |p153REMEMBER  THAT ALONG THE HARBOR OF ALGIERS THERE 'S A SEAwall . It dams the city up on the side of the hill lest it slideinto the sea . In daylight I used to walk along this wall back of the Hotel Aletti . There were Ayrab cameramen who took picturesthat came out in reverse on gray sensitized paper . These photos made me look as though I 'd happened before 1865 , in a sad light such as surrounded Mr. Lincoln . And alongside the box camera on clothespins there were suspended pictures the Ayrab was especially proud of : a French family on Sunday afternoon , sailors with their arms around girls , and GI 's peering out of an evil mist , with their shirts open and flowers in their buttonholes . Then I knew that they were drunk , with that same sharp exhibitionismof convict photos or those taken in penny arcades under cruel lighting , so that all subjects look depraved and pimply . I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round the water front , as though by going near water they were challenging the barrier that kept them from home . They 'd hang over the concrete balustrade and glare at the water and at the hospital ships and at the barrage balloons . They were people who stood on the edge of the moon , looking longingly at the earth . And all along this sea wall were sentry posts of antiaircraft installations . Back of these , thousands of soldiers peered out to sea or into the heavens . The British in their shorts rubbed themselves against the cement and murmured to one another :  --  Choom , I 'm browned off . Are you ? I remember how they talked of Africa and Africa and Africa , of how they 'd been in the bloody place for four years , and would they ever get back to Blighty . Nor were the Americans any the less on the griping , except that it was more focused  --  against officersp154and against food and against what the folks in America were doing . The Americans and the British rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many PX 's and cinemas where they could n't go , and too good rations and all the wimmin . And we thought that their battle dress smelled musty , and that what with the radio there was no excuse for so many accents and dialects as they spoke . Neither understood the other , or tried to . But we shared places with them along the Mediterranean at Alger . Their shorts hitched high as they leaned over the wall , pointing out things in the harbor . And our pants tightened over our buttocks as we pressed ourselves against the concrete , observing the shipping ridingat anchor . There 's a torture in ports when one is landbound . Along this gauntlet of men reaching out to sea and wishing they were n't there the French families of Alger used to take their Sunday walks . I thought it was n't fair for them to be so natural and at home in a foreign land . Also there used to be ladies who got whistled at , and French officers on leave , and little Ayrabs trying to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like tinted toilet paper with murals on it . It was so dirty I could n't be convinced of its value . It was printed in Philadelphia , however . I remember that in the evening the press around the harbor got thicker . Then the wall was lined with uniformed men standing elbow to elbow , as though they were in a firing squad . The moon showed their faces or their backs . There was a ripple of talk like the afterswish of a wave . But most just stared . Their eyes were points like a battalion of waiting cats in single file . There was a mute panic in them . At one cry they 'd have pushed down the wall and tumbled into the Mediterranean.  --  I should thrill to be in Algiers , I suppose . But in wartime nothing gives you any satisfaction , does it ? You do all sorts of things and find that it 's like sucking dried fruit . You thought you wanted it from the outside , but inside there 's nothing but ashes.  --  The MP 's let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house and persuaded the Fatima to let me take pictures of her , bollocky . Such exposures too . I 'm squeezing this and I 'm squeezing that of her anatomy . She just loved to be photographed . . . for a price . So now I have my own French pictures . But much clearer than those they peddle on the streets back home . I 'm having copies struck off for all my boys . By moonlight too I remember the mustaches of the old French gentlemen who use to talk to me and bum cigarettes . I 'd lift them up on the wall beside me . In their quavering voices they 'd speakp155of Petain and De Gaulle and Paris before 1940 . They hated the Germans as a father hates the man who has ravished his daughter . Shaking palsied hands in the moonlight , they 'd vow that France would rise again . Only my country was n't helping her enough.  --  What in God 's name do you want , monsewer ? We have our own war to win , you know.  --  Frogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frogs . They kicked us in the pants in 1919 and they 'll do it again . Mark my words . That goddam little teakettle still thinks she 's in the eighteenth century . You may talk of the perfection of their culture and the polish of their language . But you must consider too their penury and their bigotry for anything that is n't France . And her squat little men with the braided caps were caught snoring in 1940 . France had graft and filth within her . . . and that disease has sapped all the frogs . I remember how some nights I 'd walk up from the sea wall through a little park into the Place de l'Opera . I 'd climb a flight of stairs into that intimate theater . I heard Tosca and the Barber of Seville in French . There was also the Desert Song with asides in English to please the Americans . I heard opera in a warm frenzy because I could drink white wine between the acts . The orchestra was thirty . The singers looked better than they sang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the Lon Chaney staircase and mistily eye the people there : chic women of Alger fanning themselves in the heat , French naval officers , British holdingreceptions in bad French . I soon discovered that the Opera of Alger was a great meeting place , classier than the parks or the sea wall . For to the opera came coiffured ladies whose husbands had died in France or in Tunisia . Jeez , what a dainty little auditorium ! Like Liederkranz Hall.  --  What the hell is all this movement that goes in theaters ? I came to see the show even if they did n't . Why do n't they have some consideration for others ? I did n't come to be stared at.  --  And those ushers that make ya stand in line till they get around to showin ya to ya seat . They just want my tip.  --  Of course , of course , butch . You 're beginning to see into the parasitical life of Europe.  --  And while we 're on the subject , it burns me to haveta shell out five francs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieve myself in the little boys ' room . What 's she there for , to see that I do n't spill it all over myself ? Or I remember how some nights I used to climb the interminablep156stairs to the Salle Pierre Bordes for concerts . There the Orchestre Symphonique gave a concert of modern English music . All the French walked out when they heard Vaughn Williams and Arnold Bax and Delius . And there too Lelia Gousseau used to play the piano . I 'd sit and watch the somber trance in which she floated onto the stage of the Salle Pierre Bordes . She played Ravel with a rush of silver . Lelia Gousseau never seemed to me to be fully awake . But she was something miraculous and noble . She leaned over the keyboard and stopped breathing while she played.  --  Ya see how that babe plays the pianer ? Ya know what she needs , do n't ya ?  --  Ah , can it . Every time I try to get kultchah , ya open ya trap and talk like ya was at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporal started a ballet on the stage behind her . She simply lifted her hands off the keys and laughed without a sound till the drunk had been removed by two French janitors . Then I was sure that Lelia Gousseau was a great artist . I remember that in Algiers , because I had too much time to think and because the Mediterranean lay in front of me like a soft yet cynical mirror of time , I began to ponder on variety and difference . I lost something , because I became other people by thinking about them . For better or for worse I think I annihilated myself at this time.  --  Just wait , said the pfc with the horn-rimmed glasses , everything we know is going to be swept under.  --  But sex is here to stay , the mess sergeant said , chewing on a toothpick.  --  I did n't say it was n't , the pfc said . But so many things are coming into your life that you ca n't imagine . Imagine a world in which there 's a flatter plane of possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come closer together than they ever have before . There 's too much difference between the people of the world , yet surprisingly little variety . . . What sort of world do you want , anyway ? A world in which no one speaks to anyone else , like the people in a New York apartment ?  --  If ya 'd take off ya glasses , the mess sergeant said , and look at the world instead a books . . .  --  Well , that 's my tragedy , the pfc said . I 'm steeped in the past . I 'm not yet convinced that the break with the past is going to be complete . . . . I hope not , anyhow.  |p157I  remember the tiny dark Ayrab kids with brilliant eyes who shined shoes in front of the Red Cross . What was the difference between them and me , except that they were Ayrabs ? They were so much smarter than I , but they had n't been born in Detroit . They had the same mouths as I ; they loved American chewing gum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even pretend to have ideals . Consequently they lived in a world realer than my own . And I wondered who was equal to the world in 1944 , who was capable of seeing and understanding everything . Why was n't I a prostitute ? or a French child begging ? or a Foreign Legionnaire with scars instead of milky skin ? Why was I alive at all ? How had I possibly managed to live ?  --  You wo n't go mad , the pfc said laughing . You 're attempting to be great in the old patterns . You have the disease of empathy . You try to enter into the minds of others . Perhaps you do.  --  When I see an Ayrab child watching the chocolate bar in my hand , something tears at me.  --  It should . You 're arriving at the focus of the modern world . People are killing one another right and left . The newspapers do n't say why . It 's very simple . There 's an unfair distribution of the world 's goods . . . . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You mean I 'm not crazy when I feel like crying all the time ?  --  You 're hopelessly sane . Most people have to go to the movies to bawl . A few do it over the life they see around them . . . . The only advancement made by the human race is because some guy discovered pity . He found out that everyone was really quite like himself , with unimportant differences . We all must die alone . And we start dying with our birth . And a thousand years from now we 'll all look equally silly : the movie star , the Ayrab whore , the financier , and the hustler . . . . If only we could publicly acknowledge our silliness for the few years that we are alive , we could then pool whatever dignity we possess . Then life would be worth living for all , instead of for the few . I remember that in Alger , through too much thinking , I did something I never used to do in the States . I 'd leave the boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was because I was getting to know them too well . When you live only with men , something in you revolts after a while . Men by themselves are sterile ; they tend to become brutal and onetrack . Night after night the same jokes keep popping up , the same crap games , the same vocabulary ,  |p158the  same weary comedy . So everyone in a group of men grows to hate the others with affection , as people do after a long marriage in which they 've had no children to distract them from themselves . To this day I do n't know what I was looking for in the dark streets of Algiers . But I was alone ; I heard my blood softly boiling . My brain was going like a stove . I started again to justify my own life . Why had I been born ? Was there some scheme from which I was n't distracting , some harmony that I was smashing ? In those evenings whatever God I believed in receded from me like a comet . I found myself walking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd just come out of the womb , but there was no mother to take me by the hand . Often around midnight in a glacial fever of horror and loneliness I thought I hated everyone in the world , which had thrust me into exile . And all the cordialities that men pay to one another seemed to me only a polite uproar to drown the rattle of death . All men , I came near deciding , were secretly enemies . I 'd wonder what would happen to three men who found themselves alone at the end of the world . Would they kill one another ? Was society thereforesimply a charade to ease the torture of life ? Were we all more divided than we were united ? At such times I 'd lay my head on the concrete wall along the Mediterranean . I wanted to cry , but nothingcame except some dry hiccoughs . You 're a monster and a misanthrope , I 'd tell myself ... . I remember that one night in June , 1944 , I was walking in the garden leading from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was near midnight . The lights flickered yellowly through the trees . Sometimes an Ayrab working at the port would stumble past and cadge a cigarette . Little old men muttering to themselves made their way home . I thought of my tent at Maison Blanche . I was n't sorry for myself , but I felt passionately displaced , a body already buried alive . I chattered in my bones with a paroxysm of anguish . I put my hands tightly against the suntans on my back and called out to the leaves and the moon and the sky :  --  O my God , my God ! .. . I was still sane enough to laugh after my outcry because something in a safe corner of my brain said I was acting like a Shakespeareanham . But all the same I was alone , and for the moment out of my mind . I heard a noise behind me and turned to look , with my cry still dribbling on my lips . Behind me was a Frenchman of Algiers , not a man , not a boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ap159hawk 's in repose . He was wearing shorts and a torn faded blue shirt that was open in the June heat . Under his arm he had a sheaf of typewritten papers.  --  Qu'est-ce que tu as , Yank ? Nous autres Francais , nous connaissonsbien la melancholie . I felt compelled , like a little child , to give him my arm . He took it naturally.  --  Je suis ecrivain , he said , flourishing his manuscripts with a smile bitter and consoling . And I knew he 'd been farther down than I 'd ever yet known . He talked of Rimbaud and Verlaine and Debussy . His voice was all around me in a stream of cool elegance . He told me he 'd been born in Rio , but had sought out Paris :  --  Parce que c'est la , tu vois , ma patrie spirituelle ... . His room smelled of the linen on his cot and a dish of fruit on his night table and the leather of his books . These were his only riches . He poured me a glass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he Iead me verses out his few books . He made shooting gestures of delight with his hands , often looking at me to see whether I was following him . Evidently he desired to know how good an audience I was . Sometimes he reached over and took a cigarette out of my breast pocket . He knew some magic of disenchantmentand exorcism . He told me that I was still young , and that all was vanity . But not yet . He said that men had wept before I was ever born ... .  |p160SOMETHING  KEPT TELLING HIM THAT THE WAR OF 1918 HAD N'T been the last . He 'd enough of the Virginia gentleman in him to know that men always have fought and always will fight over women or more abstract ideals . And he 'd a degree from a southern university which had inculcated on him a certain esprit de corps . He decided to get himself a reserve commission . So he wrote to the adjutant general in Washington , went to camp each summer , and before he knew it he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state occasions : at the Rotary Club , at the Elks ' , at the Masons ' . At their luncheons they called him captain or colonel with a certain manly affection . They spoke of him as a young man with an eye to the future of his country and of himself . He spent his time in his laboratory at Roanoke . He was a petroleum engineer . By nature he was a dreamer . He thought of himself as a catalyst of the aristocracy of the Old South who 'd somehow made the conversion to the world of 1930 . He never spoke of the Civil War because he liked to assert huffily that he lived very much in the present . And he 'd married a dreamer too . She was a belle of Roanoke , belonged to the DAR and the MethodistChurch . She wrote poetry with the rapt efficiency in which most women cook . And when no editor took her verses , which fluttered and sighed like herself , she published them herself . Though she had no children , each year she Brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her thoughts on love , flowers , and life . She said that she loved life with a fierceness known only to the elect . She 'd married him because great loves , unlike butterflies , can be pinned down . Yet they saw little of each other in their Roanoke apartment . She wrote her poems and read them at women 's clubs , where shep161was applauded by wrenlike elderly ladies who then drank iced tea and champed on shortcake . He in his laboratory brooded on the possibilities of gasoline . Sometimes he forgot to take any food for a whole day , and she was too preoccupied with what she called her muse to bring him anything.  --  Ours is the ideal love , she 'd say with a towel round her head in the steaming Virginia summers . Few men or women have had a relationship as spiritual as ours . Or sometimes when a visiting business associate was about to slide under the table from bourbon , he 'd read him excerpts from his wife 's poetry.  --  Has she any children ? the business associate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already a captain in the reserve of the Army of the United States . This , he told himself , was no small potatoes . With the passage of selective service he found himselfordered to active duty to a new infantry camp in South Carolina . So he had all his uniforms dry-cleaned . And he polished his jewels , as he called his brass , with a blitzcloth . On his final night at home they gave the nigress the evening off and went out to dinner . It was the first time they 'd appeared together in public in five years . They 'd had few friends . Lucinda 'd been busy with her poetry . And he  --  well , a petroleum engineer is like a priest . Lucinda sat across from him over her lobster salad and iced coffee . Her eyes were crinkling , for she had a splitting headache . Bravely she rolled her gentian eyes in torment :  --  I should have stood in bed tonight . I 'm doing it for you , lovey . Who knows how often we 'll see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As I wrote today in blank verse , Europe has again invaded us . . . . We Americans try to lead decent lives on our own continent , and those Europeans always manage to suck us in . I see now why our ancestors left Europe . She 's rotten through and through . . . . Perhaps it would be better if she were destroyed utterly.  --  Or perhaps we should send the goddam nigras there , he said laughing . Since tomorrow he was going on active duty , he was now permittinghimself a modicum of profantity . After all , he was going to have to emerge from the cloister of his laboratory and deal with men from every state in the Union . He looked down at the crossed rifles on his dinner jacket , seeing himself shouting at his company . Yes , he 'd have a company , his very own . He thought long about that company . He 'd already planned the precision of his whole organization . He saw an order emanating from himself and passingp162down Through Channels and being put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was silent over the strawberry shortcake . He and Lucinda never spoke much except about her poetry . That was the excellence of their marriage , that neither needed to say much . Since they both had the temperaments of dreamers , the essential thing was that they should n't get in each other 's hair , or dreams . Now a sheet of silence hung between them like plate glass . He broke it.  --  If you like , I could take an apartment for you near camp . It 's not fair that you should hang around Roanoke like a goddam grass widow . Lucinda held up her little cramped hand on which the solitaire glittered like a hag 's eye :  --  Lovey , do n't . You 'll make my migraine worse . It 's caused by your leaving me . Please do n't make me suffer any more than I 'm doing , lovey .... I 'd go mad in the red sand of South Carolina . I need green grass and the fluting of the birds of Virginia .... Besides there 's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd lose all feeling for the mood .... I 'm an honest artist , lovey . I write only what I see and what I feel , not what the public wants . That 's why my books are so sad and solitary . . . . And in South Carolina I could n't recapture what I feel right now in Virginia . . . . Perhaps around Christmas I might be down . But right now there 's something in me that says No . . . . Lovey , do n't urge me . You know what my soul is like . . . a bird at dusk ... . So he put out his hand and stroked her wrist . He 'd never been much of a caresser ; possibly his mind was a trifle chilly . He remembered how in college the boys would run after spirits and nigresses , while he 'd sit in his room and read . Lucinda withdrew her hand and poked at the swilled whipped cream on her plate.  --  Oh lovey , she said , I thank you for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not . . . passionate ... it can never burn itself out.  --  Lucinda , he said , your name is you ... . It was the wildest transport of fantasy he 'd ever permitted himself . And after a while she said she was cold and her headache worse . He got her wraps . At the house before going to her room she kissed him on the corner of his mouth.  --  You 'll be gone when I get up in the morning , she said . And I wonder if you know how sometimes I wish I could be the sort of wifey who could get up and cook your breakfast and do all those little things that wifeys do . . . . But I ca n't , lovey . When a womanp163sets out to write poetry , she sacrifices most of herself . . . for a higher good . Sappho knew it . So did Elizabeth Barrett Browning.  --  Goddam it , hush , he said gallantly . I 'd rather you gave me a ticket to immortality than slave over a hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she said , making a gesture of weary renunciation in the dim hallway among the antiques , that I 'd never marry . But you dissuaded me , lovey . And I 've never regretted it . For I 've had you and my art do ... . When he left in the morning he found a manuscript lying on the top of his visored cap . It was dedicated to his initials : For you , my love , Through all the bridegroom spontaneity , Through all your e'er-retreating suave compassion , A thrill immutableSustains me like a wing of eider . And I knowThat I shall never faint or feel forlornAs long as you , my love , Return to me like snow , like spring , like birds . The seasons ' secretTurns in me as the earth remembers time , Remembering and wanting and desiring : These are the solitary sins of wives , And I am scarlet with them , Vermilion with my love for you , my love . He read this lovely thing through in the chill dead light of the dawn in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he should seek Lucinda out in her bed and smother her with kisses . But then he reconsidered and went to his train . Captain Motes arrived at the infantry camp in South Carolina . He came with just a smidgin of fanfare . He knew that it was all very well to slip into your place like a late guest . But this was different . He was a captain in the Army of the United States , and he desired to make his position plain , without goading anybody . Consequently he demanded a little more attention than civilians were getting . And he got it on the train because officers ' uniforms were still virtually unknown . His tactical intuition told him that soon America was going to war . Americans must accustom themselves to the idea of the army officer . Consequently he sat haughtilyp164in his parlor car and answered in considerable detail the questions of anxious old ladies . He made dark prophecies of what their grandchildren might have to go through in the next few years . At the station he was slightly autocratic with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he spent half an hour calling goddam over the telephone wires till he got some action . Rancid from their sleep , a group of drowsy nigras turned up in dungarees . They fumbled around with his baggage , heavy with his impedimentaand Lucinda 's poems.  --  Goddam it , get a move on , Captain Motes called . Are you still waiting for John Brown ?  --  Yassuh , the nigras said in chorus . At the gate of the camp a sentinel stopped his taxi and saluted . It was the first time he 'd been saluted outside of summer camp . He knew that soon , all over America , young men would be saluting him on every street in every town . He 'd got in early . Soon he 'd be Major Motes , and then Lieutenant Colonel Motes and then ... . The dawn in South Carolina is a red and sullen thing . First the trees stand out like corpses with splayed arms . Then the captain saw the rocks resting on the hillsides , the hardness of the sky , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open , he took his breakfast at the PX . He had n't a stomach for coffee , but he did take some tomato juice , several glasses of milk , and a piece of toast.  --  Guess it 's not often that you see an officer here , eh ? he said cheerily to the waitress.  --  No suh , she squeaked . An dey ai n't supposed to come here at all at all . Ah hates officers . Tinks dere rears does n't stink like other folkeses ' does . When dese American men gits a piece of brass on dere shoulders , dey tinks dey 's Mussolini . No suh , ah done want no truck widdem , ah don't.  --  Well , there are officers and officers , Captain Motes said , laughingindulgently.  --  Dere should n't be any officers at all , the nigra waitress said , furrowing her mouth and mopping the other tables . When you gits an army , you gits to killin fore ya knows it . An killin makes trouble to Americans . Dey ai n't used to it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you makes some better dan udders , you is askin for a bruise.  --  Wishful thinking , Captain Motes answered , leaving her a nickel tip . There have always been wars and there always will be wars . And there will always be officers and enlisted men.  |  --  Dere 's wars , said the nigress , retreating and waving an umber arm , cause a few men wants em . An ah sees yo is one of dose men . . . . Goomawnin to yo , capting . At post headquarters he went through the formality of saluting the adjutant , even though this officer was only a first lieutenant . Captain Motes enjoyed the games of the army . After his salute he stood alertly at attention in the ideal position of the officer , according to the Officers ' Guide . The adjutant had a Vermont twang and the businesslike air of one whose inner life is at loose ends.  --  Captain Motes , we are somewhat embarrassed . . . . You 're a Virginia man . . . . May I ask whether you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I have never yet met one who realized he was living after the year 1861 , either in respect to the Great Rebellion or in his relations with women.  --  Goddam it , sir , cried Captain Motes , keeping his hands tight against the seam of his trousers , we 're all together in the service of our country . I was ordered to active duty , sir , not to fight Mr. Lincoln 's war all over again . You think that all we southerners are on the aggressive against you .. .  --  You reassure me , captain , the adjutant said , uncramping his Vermont fingers . The fact is , a captain is a difficult rank to fit into an infantry replacement training center . . . . You 're neither a second nor a first lieutenant , with whom we could do something . ... Thus I must inform you that the verbal orders of the commandinggeneral are for you to command D Company of the 50th Battalion . This is an all-Negro outfit . Report to regimental headquartersfor your billet . Good morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was company commander to one hundred and fifty nigras . Since they had a thirteen-week training cycle , he saw the same black faces for three months . He saw the same black mess sergeant who kept thick steaks for him in the iceboxof the mess . Cycle after cycle he saw the same black first sergeant who 'd gone to Harvard and wrote sonnets . Cycle after cycle he saw the same black supply sergeant who whisked GI equipmentinto town and sold it through the nigress with whom he shacked.  --  These goddam nigras will drive me mad , Captain Motes saidto himself as he played solitaire in the bachelor officers ' quarters . Gradually therefore he evolved a policy whereby the nigrasshould n't drive him mad . He knew that the War Departmentvacillated on the nigra issue . On one hand every privilege was givenp166them , but on the other their segregation was complete . Captain Motes , from under his campaign hat with the oak leaves , standing rigid and tense in his leggins , watched his nigras fire on the range , run the obstacle course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MP reports on their Saturday nights in town . He cut out all passes . He smelled the musk of their bodies as they forgot to stand at attention before his desk in the orderly room . Their venereal rate was the highest in camp . He tried court-martialing for every case of venereal disease until the commanding general heard of it . Finally he no longer dealt with his men personally . From his orderly room , himself unseen , came a vise of control and discipline . On Sunday afternoons he had his men , wearing full field packs , out washing their barracks windows . Pearl Harbor came and went . Every month Captain Motes put in for a transfer away from his nigras . He was always refused . His invisible regimentation froze his nigras and their officers . They became machines . Captain Motes said that , now America had declaredwar , this was the way it should be . He 'd sacrified friends and the good will of his men for results . He was always by himself , playing solitaire or charting graphs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nigras were captured to the last man while storming Hill Fifty-eight.  --  Captain , a brigadier general said , you have done a beautiful job in killing all combat initiative in your men . I hereby hand you the booby prize as an infantry company officer . In the summer of 1942 Captain Motes was relieved of his nigras . Summoned by the adjutant , he found the Vermonter , still a first lieutenant , crinkling typewritten onionskin in his hands.  --  Captain , the twang clattered , the War Department wants you . Remember us when you go to Washington . Think of us poor foot soldiers . Yours is the fate of all those too good for the infantry ... . You 're going into military intelligence . You seem to have some recherche talent that the rest of us lack . Or perhaps you know your congressman too well ? ... At any rate here are your orders , and Godspeed to you . . . . I have a feeling you wo n't die in this war , captain.  --  Goddam it , sir , Captain Motes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders , can we ?  --  Some orders , said the lieutenant , returning the salute , are easier to take than others . Captain Motes was sent to Camp Ritchie to learn prisoner-of-war interrogation . On the way up he wondered how he 'd ever learnp167German . But then any Kraut knew German . So for days at Ritchie he fought from dummy house to dummy house . When those playingthe part of prisoners allowed themselves to be interrogated , he 'd listen to the hiss and sputter of their German , and his face would ease into an understanding smile . At every ja he 'd nod his head . Colonels often came to Ritchie from Washington to look at the school , for it was a pet of the War Department . Then Captain Motes would take it upon himself to explain what was going on to these visiting dignitaries . He kept on the lookout to buttonhole inspecting parties . The other student officers were all too busy practicing hiccoughing in German at one another . Such and other things he told Lucinda . Occasionally he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands on the oilcloth in their antique kitchen , he 'd hint of task forces , of combat teams . His strategic sense told him that there must be an invasion of North Africa to start taking the Mediterranean away from the Axis . Ripples of horror spread over Lucinda 's face . It was the first time he 'd ever really been eloquent with her . He bought an illuminated globe for their library and a supply of colored ribbons and thumbtacksso that she could plot every phase of the coming American struggle in Europe . She began reading War and Peace and wrote a poem beginning : Men who run forth to dieFrom the Mississippi , from Iowa , from Nohwata Oklahoma .. . It was published in a Roanoke evening newspaper . The ladies ' clubs said that she would be the Winifred M. Letts of this war.  --  If I should die someplace in Europe , Captain Motes said . Lucinda covered her temples with her hands.  --  Goddam it , darling , he resumed , how strange life is . . . all my life I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Do n't , she breathed , looking at him through her fingers , do n't , lovey . We play with greatness to our own peril . It 's such a perilous thing . We mature so slowly , keeping within ourselves the kernel of our own time sense . And suddenly it bursts on the world ... . Her fecundity in these days was such that she wrote and wrote , standing at her black walnut antique writing desk . She would have fainted if Hattie the nigress had n't occasionally brought her a tray with sandwiches and fruit juice . In October , 1942 , Captain Motes was alerted for overseas movement . Washington was whirling softly and pregnantly . Peoplep168ducked in and out of the Mayflower and the Willard . Briefcases tossed through the streets like flat somber Japanese lanterns . And Captain Motes got a company of one hundred men . Daily he went with them on the range , insisting on their firing all the weapons in the training manuals . There kept recurring in his vocabulary phrases such as D-Day and Cut to Pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak to old acquaintances . One night , though they were alerted for staging , he slipped under the barbed wire and met Lucinda at Hampton Roads . It was forbidden to hold any communication from the port of embarkation , but Captain Motes knew that as an intelligence officer he could trust himself . Lucinda wept when he told her they were sailing the following morning . He told too the number of ships in the convoy . He guessed also that they 'd land on the northwest coast of Africa.  --  We must rig up a code , lovey , she said panting , so I 'll always know just where you are . And all the other pieces of information a wifey needs for her peace of mind.  --  Not necessary , he answered smiling and patting her hand . He looked around the restaurant with a hideous penetration , then took something with a wooden handle on it out of his pocket .  --  Mercy , lovey ! What 's that , a grenade ?  --  A base censor stamp . With this on the envelope I can write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . if I should n't come back , remember me as I am tonight . . . and if I have ever hurt you . . . She laid her head on the tablecloth and streaked it with the rivers from her eyes . Captain Motes kissed her on the hair and raced out into the night . That was the way he desired to remember Lucinda in the pelting of bullets and the screaming and battle fury of maddenedand dying men . On 7 November 1942 , the great armada bobbed uncertainly . Word passed that they were off the coast of Africa.  --  This is it , kids , was the word that flicked from mouth to mouth like a tight bit . Captain Motes spent all his time with his men , though it was difficult to brake himself down to their tempo , which seemed maddeninglyinert . They chewed gum and shot craps . He encouraged them and cracked jokes at them . He called up his store of warlike stories , even going back to Julius Caesar.  --  One of the great moments in the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ! Whereas the other officers on his ship seemed idiotically calm ,  |p169like  men playing in the shadow of doom . This was the way it had been at Pearl Harbor , Captain Motes told himself , pitying them their complacency.  --  Captain , one officer drawled , you 're purple . How 's your blood pressure ?  --  Fine , fine , goddam it to hell ! he screamed and raced about the deck with his field glasses . Before dawn on 8 November 1942 , a fearful roaring set up . The convoy began to move in toward the murky outlines of Africa . The sky vibrated with lights and tracers . The navy opened up on Casablanca and Fedhala . Captain Motes , sleeping clothed and in his leggins , rushed to hearten and exhort his troops . Poor lads , this was the last of life for many of them . But nothing happened . Captain Motes raced over the decks shouting that someone had blundered , that they should all be on shore by this time . Then through the hell of firing and smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Put on ya helmet or go below . We ai n't landin for a week yet . What the hell do ya think ya are , assault troops ? One week after the Casablanca landings , after lying offshore several miles , Captain Motes 's ship entered the harbor and leisurely unloaded . But that week he spent tossing in the slow swells of the gray Atlantic and listening to the firing ashore was the most tantalizing the captain had spent in his life . He began to accuse his company of malingering and cowardice when he detected signs of relief that they had n't been in on the landing operations . He heard news from the shore that casualties had been heavier than expected because the French and the French Navy had n't been quite so co-operative as everyone had counted on . He heard of legs floating off Oran . He heard of American dead at Fedhala , of French sniping from the windows in the Place de France in Casa . He heard how Ayrabs went from side to side selling information and perpetrating ghoulish atrocities on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bed in the Villa Miramar after the German armistice delegation had fled into the torchy night with their mistresses and their nightshirts . He heard how the entire 3rd Division was bivouacked on the Fedhala golf course . Captain Motes scrambled fretfully about the vessel , shuttling between the navy gun crews and American officers waiting to go ashore :  --  Fine scrap , fine scrap . . . and we would have to miss it . I was . itching for the real thing .... Well , they goddam wo n't do me out . of it a second time . On 16 November 1942 , he entered Casa with his company.  |p170They  marched tranquilly off the ship . There was little to show that only eight days ago Americans had been killed here  --  a little wreckage in the harbor . The Ayrabs were already well versed in the Americanese of cigarettes , bonbons , and chewing gum . The French on the streets were lean and leering , just as he 'd expected them to be from books . Captain Motes knew at sight that he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language , that would be like apprenticing himself as a quisling to the Vichy government . His eyes narrowed under his helmet as he marched along , tearing at the strap of his carbine . Under his armpit a tiny revolver nestled . He was ready for anything . The privilege of entering Casa on D-Day had been denied him . But he 'd make up for it . The Atlantic Base Section was already in operation . Its function was supply . Choice hotels and villas had been requisitioned from Casablanca to Fez . There were already messes and clubs throughout French Morocco . Some officers of the base section had already chosen their mistresses and had settled down to the luxurious drudgery of rear area life , where they expected to vegetate for years . Captain Motes got a room at the Hotel Majestique . It had a floor of Moroccan tile with cabalistic symbols , a chamber pot , and a closet . The bed smelled like the Ayrabs . To clean his room he 'd a Fatima with blue stars on her cheeks . She giggled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover and clinking jewelry . He gave her cigarettes to stay out of his room while he was in it , for she stank like goat 's milk . After he 'd unpacked his beddingroll and hung up his carbine and helmet in a military and sinister manner , he sat down to write a letter to Lucinda . Somewhere in North Africa 9 November 1942My darling , The headlines will have told you exactly where I am . I 'm lying under my shelterhalf as I write this . In the distance I can still hear the firing . It sounds like fat popping in a frying pan . Darling , I 've been through an indescribable twenty-four hours . With your lovely poet 's mind you can intuit the horror of it all . I 'll spare you the details . Suffice it to say that they gave us hell . I have n't suffered so much myself . I 'm still in one piece . What got me was to see those lovely fellows in my company fall bubbling into the ocean or drop soundlessly in their tracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing to you first , my darling . After that I have a long string of letters to get off to the families of my poor devils . Lucinda , I know what death means now . I noticed some white hairs inp171my beard as I was shaving out of my helmet this morning . But this is war , and I hope the American people will wise up to the fact  --  but fast . I 'm living in a grove where the rain never stops falling . The mud of North Africa is like melted chocolate ice cream . A sentinel has just passed . Perhaps he too is thinking of his wife . The image of you is constantly before me . Keep sweet ... . Captain Motes read his letter over several times . Then he filled his washbowl and put the sheet of paper into it . He swooshed his . letter quickly around in the water , then let the blurred letters dry . He sealed it in its envelope . On the lower left-hand corner he affixed the base censor 's stamp he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a base censorship detachment had yet been set up in Casa ; but if it had , that stamp would let his letter go through unopened . Next morning Captain Motes , wearing leggins and side arms , reported to the Shell Building on Boulevard de la Gare . It was the headquarters of the Atlantic Base Section . He went at once to a certain office , the location of which he 'd demanded of the MP . This was the most ornate and inaccessible of all the offices . At the desk was the captain who was aide to the commanding general . This aide sounded off , out of an easy familiarity with the great :  --  Do n't be a goon , captain . You simply can not see the general . He 's still setting up ABS . The fighting stopped in Casablanca only last week . He 's a very busy man , the general .. .  --  I 'm afraid you do n't understand , sir , said Captain Motes with a mellow laugh . I am . . . keep this under your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen , captain , the aide beamed , picking up a phone . There were scads of em running around and asking stupid questionson the beach under fire . . . . He hates em . Now they 're coming out of their holes and askin for cushy jobs . Come back in a month , captain . . .  --  I advise you to let me see the general , Captain Motes said , raising his voice to underline his intentions . Then a short fierce man with a star on his collar stormed out of the inner sanctum . His white eyebrows met over his nose . His mouth was a cold dash of red on his face . Captain Motes snapped to attention.  --  For Chrissake step inside , the general bawled . Stop rubbing your hands together and talk to me as man to man .... I suppose they flew you over from Washington . That 's the way the hellish thing always operates . No replacements or no prophylactics or glarep172goggles , but they 're forever flying in intelligence officers and the CID to check up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hooks to me because I have n't had time yet to take care of the security angle . What for Chrissakes do they think a war is in Washington ? Cutting up letters ? The little old man ran round his desk like a terrier trying to remember where he 's buried a bone . Back of his desk was an Americanflag drooping from an ebony pole , the perch of a golden eagle . Captain Motes hesitated , prodding his dubbined toe into the rich nap of the rug.  --  I wo n't lie to the general , he said softly , returning to the position of attention . Washington is . . . well , disappointed at the intelligencesetup here . No BCD . No traveler censorship at the airport . As they understand it , and the general does too , a base section must do all the brainwork for our fighting men .. .  --  Close your yap , the general screamed , running in the opposite direction . I suppose this means I 'll never get my second star.  --  There was talk in Washington , Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine work the general is doing here ... . One man ca n't think of everything , sir.  --  Very well ! . . . Shut up and listen to me and stop rubbing your hands . I 'm giving you a direct order . VOCG . The stencils will be cut this afternoon . . . . It is my desire that you take charge of all censorship in the Atlantic Base Section . . . . Are you listening ? I do n't want to be bothered ever again with any of this damn G-2 nonsense , do you hear , captain ? I delegate it all to you . Read all the letters you please . But I do n't ever want to see your face again unless I send for you . Now get the hell out of my office . Captain Motes saluted and wheeled into the streets of Casablanca . So as the North African Theater of Operations became the ominous and murky name NATOUSA , Captain Motes became postal censor of this area , which some thought was an Ayrab city which they sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The importance of the work of censorship made Captain Motes secretive and distrustful . He was jealous of the weight of his own mission . He thought of himself as uneasy and as friendless as a king . After office hours he tended to spend all his time in his hotel room , dreaming up ways to extend his censorship empire . Eventually , as the war came onto the continent of Europe , he saw himself as chief theater censor with offices in each new fallen city.  |p173And  as Hollywood magnates acquire the feeling that they control the emotions of the world , so did Captain Motes grow aware that he wielded a baton over the thoughts of all the soldiers and officers in North Africa . He became more nervous . His walk developed a sidelong twitch that was almost a wish . He smoked more because he could n't take to cognac and Casablancaises the way all the others seemed to . His head was too full of military secrets and classified material for him to trust himself to relax . If he drank or made love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing gray . He never told Lucinda exactly what he was doing , even though he had the privilege of sending his letters out of the theater with his special stamp affixed . He discouraged his officers ' leaving the city where they worked , for he had a dread of intelligence officers ' getting together and hashing over what they knew . Finally he decreed that all officers working together should mess and live together in the same billets.  --  Captain , said one of his examiners , is n't it hell enough to have to read mail all day long side by side with sixty other officers at the same table ? Do I have to look at their ugly faces for twenty-four hours on end ?  --  This is war , Captain Motes answered , lighting a cigarette from the butt of the last . People in Tunisia are living in the same foxholesmonth after month . Goddam it , you 're better off than most of the people in the States.  --  Are you threatening me with the front ? It would be heaven besides sitting on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to decipher what an illiterate Negro writes to his exshackjobback in Georgia . . . . Smiles . . . . Ha-ha , baby . . . . Letter writing is no longer a fine art , captain .... I 'm bucking for a section eight.  --  You were commissioned in military intelligence , Captain Motes replied , toying with Lucinda 's picture . Do you wish to resign your rank ?  --  I 'm going rapidly mad , the lieutenant said.  --  If you think you are , it 's a sure sign you 're not . . . . Take the afternoon off and go to the movies . Captain Motes heard that his officers were using the unit 's trucks for week-end trips to Fez and Rabat . He ordered the practice to cease at once . What would the taxpayers say if they knew that the gasoline they were doing without was being used for pleasure jaunts ? He took none himself . He even begrudged himself his personal jeep . He looked with a bloodshot eye on the time hisp174officers spent with the girls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . God only knew what military secrets they might be revealing to these girls . One day he made a speech to all his command as they sat under the rows of strung lights at the long tables laden with mail . They peered at him from under their eyeshades :  --  We must not forget , men , that a short time ago these French were entertaining the Germans . They shot at our boys when they landed here .... I 'm putting this to you as American commissioned officers . Do you think it . . . prudent to . . . fraternize with these French ? . . . I am not forbidding it , gentlemen . I merely suggest that you think it over . On whose side are you fighting ? These North African French are simply milking you for all they can get.  --  But the captain knows no French , a voice spoke up . A lot of us do , and enjoy talking the language.  --  That 's beside the point . Neither do I know Japanese . I simply would think twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some woman who does n't even pay me the compliment of learning my language . God only knows what 's going on in the back of a frog 's head.  --  I resent that ! another voice cried . The French are our allies.  --  Well , think it over , gentlemen , Captain Motes said . Think it over . . . . Remember that you 're in Africa to help win a war . After this uneasy session Captain Motes rarely addressed his commandsdirectly . He knew their hostility . He arranged that the base post office should send him all his officers ' mail . He read it and censored it in his hotel room each evening . A leader must know how far he can trust his subordinates . Many evenings at his desk his cheeks scorched at what was said about him in V-mails . But now he had an exact index of whom he could trust of his officers and how far . From the letters of a plump sturdy lieutenant he chose his executive officer . Lieutenant Frank was a cavalry sergeant of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , straightshooting . He 'd come up the hard way , so he had no use for an army of conscripts and pale civilians commissioned after ninety days at officer candidate school . Lieutenant Frank entered rooms like a steam roller , never knocking , but kicking doors open . Oaths dropped liberally from his lips . He said that men must be sworn at to get things done.  --  Them goddam letter openers , he would cry . A buncha ninnies . Commissioned schoolteachers . . . . Ya too kind withem , captain.  |p175I  treat em like an old first sergeant , and they think rnorea me . Throw the book at em when they step outa line . It 's the only language they 'll understand.  --  But they 're commissioned officers in the United States Army .  --  Ah , crud . They 'll do as they 're tole . They 're in the army , ai n't they ? They 'll take their orders just like you an me . Lieutenant Frank sometimes nudged his commanding officer to bring home the point of his remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lieutenant Frank a new regimen was adopted in all the base censorship detachments of North Africa . The ten-minute break for each hour was abolished . Examiners were permitted one fifteen-minute interval in the morning , one in the afternoon . A time clock was set up at the entrance of each examination room . Each officer must punch his ticket as he entered and left work . There was no going to the latrine without permission of the front office . In order to step up the number of letters that each officer read , no talking or whispering was permittedat the examination tables . Officers late to their office hours were restricted to quarters for the week end and given a punishmentOD . Captain Motes told his officers through the mouth of Lieutenant Frank that they must not forget they were still in the army ; there was danger of hemorrhoids and potbellies from too much sitting . Sometimes , sitting till after midnight in his hotel room and hearing the buzz of Casablanca fade out till there was only the moaning of the sea , Captain Motes found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . He read them all now every night . For they bitched to their wives and friends about the work and about himself . He was hurt and astonished to see how indiscreetly intelligence officers wrote . He suspected that the constanthandling of classified matter had blunted their sensitivity to security measures . One officer wrote to his girl : A commissioned officer in the United States Army ! Why , with this introverted bastard who 's our CO , I had more prestige and privilege as a Plc ! I think that nothing worse can happen in this outfit , and it always does .... Captain Motes did n't speak directly to the officer who wrote this letter . He simply had him transferred to the Oran office , with orders that he be employed on the table where all day long packageswere opened , censored , and tied up again . Work for grocery clerks , but done by men with bars.  |p176Often  in the mornings he 'd stand in front of the plate-glass screen that shut off the front office from the room where the mail was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how many were reading Stars and Stripes or magazines on the government'stime , how many were writing V-mails , how many were staringinto space . As a result of this reconnoitering a new order came out , signed by Lieutenant Frank as executive officer . This order stated that each officer must read two hundred ordinary letters or five hundred V-mails in one working day . Those who fell below their quota would report for evening duty . But because Captain Motes had observed how pale and weary his examiners had grown under the screaming nitrogen reading lamps , he prescribed one hour of close-order drill for all officers after work was done in the afternoon , to be taken in the open sunlight . The order ended rationally and sweetly :  --  We are all officers and owe it to ourselves and our country to keep in A-i physical condition . As he was about to leave the front office that evening , Captain Motes had a visit from one of his letter openers , the redheaded Lieutenant Almeranti , who 'd been yanked out of the armored force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beetling and whining letters he wrote home . Lieutenant Almeranti 's red eyebrows were bouncing like springs . He leaned with both hands on Captain Motes 's desk.  --  Do n't you believe in standing at attention before your commanding officer ?  --  I 'm not an enlisted man . And I 'm tired of playing soldier around here . . . . You 're demoralizing all of us by treating us like prisoners of war . You 've made a sweatshop of this detachment and then you turn around and pretend you 're GI . You 're not . You 're the warden of a reform school . . . . Captain , I want a transfer ... . Are you trying to drive us all crazy ? Have you ever sat and tried to read mail for eight hours ? After a while your head starts to whirl and all you can think about is the war and your home and your wife ...  --  It is a difficult task , Captain Motes said smoothly . As your commanding officer , no one is more aware of your complaints than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night , there are many unsung heroes in the rear echelons . At the front they face danger . Here we die of boredom . . . . Did I ever tell you about my wife ? She 's something of a writer . This is her latest book of verse , Lieuten-ant ... ?  |  --  Ca n't you even remember my name ? . . . Listen , captain . I want to pull out of this censorship shit . I was trained for the armored force . I 'm willing to go into combat . . . . It 's this negative work , day after day after day , that gets me . . . . I want some action . I 'll risk my life rather than my reason . . . . But I wo n't sit out the war on my tail snipping Casablanca off the dateline of letters.  --  Do n't undervalue yourself , Captain Motes said , lighting another cigarette . You 're an expert , and censorship is a very restrictive field . Do n't imagine that every officer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  That 's all very fine , Lieutenant Almeranti said , tossing his lion 's mane , but I still wish to get transferred out of your outfit.  --  Then have the sergeant major type you up a transfer.  --  What good will that do if you only write disapproved on it ? . . . Listen , captain . I know G-2 policy inside out . They hold onto their personnel like bulldogs so they can have big commands and get promotions . . . by our sweat . . . . I want your permission to go over your head for this transfer.  --  You have it , Captain Motes said with weary sweetness . TomorrowI 'm giving you an hour off from work to go to the Shell Building and see the A C of S G-2 yourself.  --  This is almost too good to be true , Lieutenant Almeranti said . He saluted and left the front office . When the lieutenant had gone , Captain Motes thought and smoked three cigarettes . Then he put out his hand for his field phone . He knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his office in the Shell Building . There he drank , played solitaire ' , wrote poetry for Stars and Stripes , and made love to his French secretary . So Captain Motes dialed , hoping to find this colonel in . He was.  --  Colonel ? Evening . . . . Motes speaking , sir . . . . How are tricks ? Long time no see . . . . Well , fancy that , sir . . . . Sir , I have a problem , and a man of your experience should be able to see right to the bottom of it . Are you listening , colonel ? I 'll only take a moment of your time , sir ... . Then over the phone , dropping his voice as though the wires were tapped , Captain Motes told the tale of a certain officer of his who wished to leave his outfit . Of how the man was incompetent and unworthy of his commission . Of how this officer should not be permitted to go to another outfit , where he might irreparably sabotage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at present he was doing a minimum of harm by reading letters , which after all was a job for a deadhead . How Captain Motes hoped by his in/fluence to rehabilitate this officer and make him again into a real man . Of how this officer was often drunk and scandalous in public . Of how this officer in question would probably come in to see the colonel tomorrow with a pack of alarmist lies ... . When he 'd finished telephoning , Captain Motes sighed over the perfidy of the world , donned his field jacket , and went out into the sunset on the Boulevard de la Care . He messed at the Roi de la Biere . As he sat down to his soup of C-ration , a young lieutenant in the seat opposite rose until he 'd taken his chair . This pleased Captain Motes . Deference to rank was rarely observed in officers ' messes outside the United States . Then he realized he 'd seen the young lieutenant that very morning , one of five fresh replacements to his own detachment of censors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked the young lieutenant over : the brown face , the thick oiled mustache , the huge eyes of beasties peering out of copses ( Lucinda 's phrase ) .  --  Just call me Stuki , the lieutenant said . His teeth seemed of vanilla.  --  Well , of course there are certain formalities to be observed , said Captain Motes amiably . Unless I 'm mistaken , I 'm your new commanding officer.  --  I know it . . . . Pleased ta meetcha , I 'm sure . . . . And can I say somethin , captain ? I felt sorta bad this mornin when ya did n't come over an shake me by the hand . . . . A fella sorta likes to meet up with his CO when he reports to a new assignment.  --  Of course ; of course . . . . I was very busy . . . but I made a note on my desk calendar to call you in first thing tomorrow morning.  --  The boys tole me , Stuki said , sailing languorously into his meat loaf , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . That 's what they said . . . . But when I sawya in ya office , I said to myself , That 's a soldier . Regular army maybe . The kind of guy that knows he has a job to do an no nonsense . That 's the kinda guy I like to take orders from . Also ( he leaned forward , twitching his mustache daintily ) I thought to myself that guys that talk that way about their own CO must be yella rats.  --  They are difficult men to deal with , Captain Motes conceded.  --  I hope ya do n't mind me talking to ya in this frank manner , Stuki said , a warm glaze crinkling his eyes . But I like ta put my cards on the table , captain . I came inta this man 's army to do a job and take orders . . . . Willya shake hands with me , captain ? Captain Motes was ignited from within by a strange flaring ofp179hope and joy . He 'd been lonely . Yet he must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in himself , to trusting no one , that any kind little remark lit him up inside . But he put out his hand across the catsup bottles and pressed Stuki 's . Into his own slid a warm and slightly moist hand like a bird into her nest . Stuki held on to the captain 's hand with varying pressures and affections.  --  Gee , thanks , Stuki said , his mustache in repose like a setting hen . Now I feel better . . . . Ya 'll never know how I felt this mornin comin inta ya outfit . Seemed like nobody wanted me . Treated me like I had mental BO . . . . An I take a bath every night . . . . They just sat an looked at me and kept sayin , You 'll be sorry ! . . . The resta the time they tore you apart.  --  They hate me . I try to be impartial and end by pleasing no one.  --  So there ya are , Stuki sighed . That 's life for ya . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ya , I knew they was a bunch of stinkers.  --  Perhaps you can help me to understand them better , said Captain Motes . As the meal advanced , so did their intimacy . They seemed to have known one another a long time . By the pineapple , it was clear to Captain Motes that Stuki had conceived a doglike devotion to him . A rocket of inspiration went off in Captain Motes 's head . In spite of the difference in their ranks , he invited Stuki to share his hotel room . With Stuki he began a new sort of life , centered around a freedomand devotion he 'd never before known . Stuki took care of everything : sending out laundry , tipping the Fatima who cleaned the room , even writing the captain 's letters for him . By May , 1943 , when spring came to Casa with a smell of jasmine and dung in bittersweet layers , Stuki would lie nude under his mosquito netting and listen while Captain Motes read aloud from Lucinda 's poetry . Stuki 's body was black and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pleasure at Lucinda 's love poems . Or during her sonnets on renunciation Stuki would lie motionless , his cigarette a glowing dot of red , his mustache placid as a half-moon.  --  Gee , she sends me . Ya wife 's a great poet . One of these days I 'm gon na meet her . Da ya think she 'll like me ? Da ya think she 'll adopt me inta the family ? Captain Motes got so he could n't bear to spend time away from Stuki . The relationship between them was perfect : Stuki neverp180overstepped the boundary between their ranks ; there was a subtle deference in everything he said to Captain Motes , though he called him simply you when they were n't in public . Eventually , to have his lieutenant always with him , Captain Motes ordered that Stuki be taken off the examination table . Another desk was put in the captain 's glass front office , and the position of supply officer was created for him . That night in their room Stuki got drunk on Casablanca rum and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off that table of letter openers ... . Ya know what they call me ? . . . Brown-nose . . . . They said that no second lieutenant should be the roommate of his commanding officer ... If it 's gon na cause ya so much embarrassment , I 'll move out.  --  Goddam it , Captain Motes cried nobly , I wo n't hear of it . In the spring of 1943 his nerves were stringy . Stuki could deal with that too . The captain would lie belly down on his bed , and Stuki would massage his spinal column . His body would go slack all over as those powerful moist fingers tugged at his nerves , and he 'd fall into a swoonlike sleep . He 'd awake at dawn next morning to find that Stuki 'd undressed him and had put up his mosquito netting . And by the rising sun Captain Motes would look over into the other bed and see that dark face snoring soundlessly up at the ceiling , the mustache furled like wings over the half-open mouth . And Captain Motes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One day Lucinda wrote back in a V-mail :  --  And who , pray , is this Stuki ? I suspect you have an Arab mistress ... . On week ends he and Stuki would take the jeep and drive out to Fedhala for golf , or to Rabat to a black market restaurant for spicy lobsters and wine . Or they 'd go swimming by Villa Moss . Stuki would lie in the sun till his skin got like teak . Stuki went to the Sixth General Hospital for a three days ' reamingbecause he got piles from too much desk work . Captain Motes felt lost in his office and in his room . Each night he visited his roommate in the Sixth General , bringing fruit and flowers.  --  Ya should n't do all this for me . Ya must n't put yaself out this way . Ya too good . Meanwhile Captain Motes did some manipulating and some furious talking to the assistant chief of staff G-2 . So when Stuki limped out of the hospital , the captain was waiting for him in the jeep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea atp181Fedhala . He took the gold bar off Stuki 's collar and pinned on a silver one . Stuki looked down ; his chest began to quiver :  --  Oh ya shouldn'ta , ya shouldn'ta , chief . . . . Now they 'll hate me all the more . . . . I have to live among them vultures and hyenas . After Stuki 's promotion the situation in the front office got involved . Lieutenant Frank sat at his desk and glowered at Stuki 's new silver bar . Lieutenant Frank 's paunch was growing heavier ; his rear end had a spread like an ashcan dropped from a top story . He had a Casablancaise mistress and smoked two PX rations of thick dark cigars . But he was n't happy . He mumbled to himself about the length of time he 'd been in grade , and how doing your job in the army really did n't pay off . He glared at Captain Motes out of the fat around his little eyes , and he stared at Stuki , who bridled a dozen times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and twittered :  --  Fresssssssh ! Whaddya lookin at ? Didja bang yaself silly all las night ? The strain in the front office was palpable even to the files of officers sitting out in the examination room under the harsh lights , reading their mail or talking up their whispering campaign . Their eyes in their black glasses or horn-rimmed spectacles would pierce the glass partition , where they could see the uneven and unequal triangle of Captain Motes , Stuki , and Lieutenant Frank peering at one another . Captain Motes at first thought it might be necessary to transfer his executive officer to Oran or Algiers . But then , who but Lieutenant Frank was capable of talking to the men and striking the fear of God into them ?  --  Fresssssh ! Stuki said again . Nervous in the service ? Why don'tcha go out for a nice long walk ? Lieutenant Frank strode into the examination room . They could hear his voice and see his broad rear in pink pants . He was lecturingthe officers on military courtesy . Someone had passed him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a hiss . Into the open door of the front office hurled a censor 's exacto knife . It gibbered in the cork wall behind Captain Motes 's head like a movie dagger . Simultaneously there was bedlam in the examination room . Stuki and Captain Motes ran out to the examinationtables . The officers had left their work and were standing in a numb knot around Lieutenant Almeranti , who was winding up to let fly another exacto knife . He was chuckling to himself :  --  Incest , kids , incest . . . . Then Lieutenant Almeranti took a pile of unread V-mails andp182tore them to pieces . He was ripping to shreds letters written by officers and GI 's of the army in Africa . The pupils of his eyes were popping like eggs , his forehead was glistening with sweat.  --  Stop him , someone , Captain Motes hollered . This is a courtmartialoffense . He took several steps forward , and Lieutenant Almeranti smashed the rest of the stack of mail into his face . The censors peered at the scene with dull absorption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll censor you all ! I 'll G-2 you ! . . . There ai n't no promotions this side of the ocean.  --  Put down that knife , ya fool ! Stuki shrieked . Lieutenant Almeranti bore down again on Captain Motes . His arms were swinging , his eyes bloody and spinning.  --  And this , kids , is our chief base censor .. . Stuki leaped through the air . Captain Motes saw the blur of his rush and Stuki 's mustache grim and taut . There was a smell of cologne . Lieutenant Almeranti went down under Stuki in a litter of torn V-mails and ruptured envelopes . He went rigid , his eyeballs rolled up , he had a quick sighing paroxysm , and passed out . Now Lieutenant Frank became the man of action . He champed on his cigar , called out orders in his beefy voice , and stamped to the phone for a psychiatrist and ambulance from the Sixth General Hospital.  --  Go right on with ya readin , boys , Stuki said , picking himself off the floor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was little work done that morning . The examiners sat at their tables and smoked and muttered . It seemed that Lieutenant Almeranti had gone nuttier than a fruitcake and would be sent back to the States . Lieutenant Frank made two speeches , telling them they could all hope to end up like Almeranti if they did n't settle down :  --  Why don'tcha act like officers instead a the wimmin 's garment union ?  --  Send em all back to their billets for the day , huh , chief ? Stuki said.  --  I wo n't coddle them ! Captain Motes shouted , pacing the front office . We have our quota of mail for each day . They 'll read it , goddam it , they 'll read it . He 'd decided however to fly to Algiers that evening to investigatecensorship procedures at Allied Force Headquarters . He told Stuki to pack two bags and meet him at Cazes airport . They heardp183the voice of Lieutenant Frank still haranguing the frightened examiners :  --  Oh ya do n't believe me ? I can court-martial each an every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the permanent grade of private . . . . Ya do n't believe me ? On their second day in Algiers they had a phone call from LieutenantFrank , shouting over the wires as though he desired to make himself heard all the way from Casablanca :  --  Ya , ya heard me right . . . , The inspector general 's here givin ya entire outfit the shakedown . . . . No , it ai n't a routine inspection . All ya goddam officers petitioned for him to come here . . . . Ya , that 's right . Right now he 's sittin at the desk in ya office . Every officer and GI of ya command is standing in line , waiting his turn to cry on the IG 's shoulder . . . . Some of them has written out complaints a mile long . Half the officers tole me ta my face that the least you could expect after the IG gets through with ya is Leavenworth ... . That evening in his Algiers billet , thinking of what the inspector general must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had one of his nervous fits . As the moonlight tittered in , he lay under his mosquito netting . His teeth began to click and his eyes to roll . He gave out small moans and gasps like a woman in love . Cramps gathered in the calves of his legs . He felt his fists clenching at his sides . It seemed to him he 'd never known such indefinable terror , with all the frightful things of this world and the next gathering in the dusk to spring upon him . Stuki jumped out of his bed and was at his side in a flowered kimono.  --  Whassamatta , chief ?  --  My God , they 're crucifying me in Casa , the captain murmured , cushioning his forehead.  --  They 're filthy sneakin dogs . Do n't pay no heed to em . . Ya 'll come out on top . And Stuki 's moist hard hands commenced working at the captain 's spine . And Stuki 's voice dropped to the liquid caressing whimper that it adopted on such occasions :  --  Ya hear me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of em . . . . Lissen ta me , chief . Ya all right ? . . . We 'll lick em together , you an me . After a while the spasms faded and the horrors paled . Captain Motes fell asleep . The last thing he remembered was hands , kind hands that knew him as well as a mold informs a piece of clay to its own image.  |p184On  the following morning he and Stuki called on the chief of staff , G-2 , AFHQ , in the Saint George Hotel . He was a cheery colonel who before the war had owned a grocery store in Chicago . Now with a brigadier general and a British and American staff he ran most of the intelligence operations in the North African theater . His shirt breast was plagued with ribbons . On his collar was the star of the general staff corps . He had the red and seamy face of one accustomed to attend midnight sessions of plotters and planners . He shook hands with Captain Motes and Stuki , who surprised him doing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , surprise , surprise ! . . . Did n't know you were in Algiers . . . . We call you our country cousins from Casa . How 's every little thing ? Just step in to my inner office ... . Got a little treat for you . The colonel 's inner office was four walls covered with enameled maps . All the maps were stamped SECRET in red block letters at top and bottom . They were planted with hedges of thumbtacks from which streamed ribbons of pastel silk . On the colonel 's desk was a herd of camels of graduated sizes walking along the glass in safari file.  --  This office , said the colonel clearing his throat , well , you might almost call it the brain of all NATOUSA.  --  Gee , sir , Stuki said , fingering a map stamped MOST SECRETEQUALS BRITISH SECRET , sorta makes a guy stop and think , do n't it ?  --  I 'd advise you not to try to take secret photographs of thosemaps , lieutenant , the colonel said loudly.  --  He 's my most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know , the colonel said , leading them away from the maps and slapping their backs . But we in military intelligence ca n't even afford to trust one another , can we , ha-ha . . . . You know how it is , boys . . . . My God , when I think of how much I know , I 'm almost afraid to chugalug a drink or go out with a pretty little French girl , ha-ha . . . . Sometimes I wake up at night with a cold shiver and think of how much there is in this old skull of mine , ha-ha.  --  Ya would n't be wearin that eagle if ya were n't capable of ya job , sir , Stuki said.  --  Well , thank you , ha-ha , thank you , the colonel boomed , bending over his desk drawer . And now , Captain Motes , if you 'll be so good as to take off your insignia . . . Captain Motes felt his heart dive from some trapeze . But he reached up and fumbled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took something out of his desk drawer and approached him . He opened his palm to display a chaste gold leaf , which he then with his own hands fastened to the collar tab from which the former insignia had been tremulously torn away.  --  Major Motes ! Military intelligence takes care of its own . For a long time our office has been watching your operations down Casablanca way . We lamented that we could n't do more for you . .. . But like all great and honest men , you can now reap more than the inner reward , satisfying as that may be , ha-ha . . . . If I was French I 'd kiss you on both cheeks . . . . You are the father of censorship in North Africa . And what a bouncing healthy baby it is , ha-ha . . . . Congratulations , Major Motes . Major Motes saw the whole vaulted office , its maps and indirect lighting , whirling like a pinwhel before his eyes . People streamed in from other offices to shake his hand . British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and called him Old Man . Stuki stood beside the new major like a hostess , murmuring his name to the queue of officers . Stuki even linked his arm with Major Motes 's , who was so moved he could scarcely stand . Then there was a shrill yap of attention . There entered goutily an elderly British brigadier , carrying in both hands a small medal hanging from a broad violet ribbon . This he suspended round Major Motes 's neck , all the while burring away like a sewing machine :  --  His Majesty the King of England is pleased to acknowledge Major Motes 's services to military censorship . . . . Stout fellow ... . That evening Allied Force G-2 gave a party for Major Motes . It began on the beach at Ain-Taya . Colonels , majors , and captains all went swimming in the mellow surf of the Mediterranean . Stuki 's was the lowest rank there , but the major kept his assistant always with him and presented him to all , beaming :  --  This , gentlemen , is the backbone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers like him . But he 's the cream . And Stuki , shy at first , gradually sallied forth with a good word to this colonel or that major . Major Motes was surprised to find that Stuki knew all their names , and in exactly what branch of G-2 they were : maps , photo reconnaissance , documents , liaison , topography , code and cipher . Stuki 's mustache was foam-flecked from the salt water . After a few drinks he 'd chase a major on the beach or crack a joke with a captain from the I and E office . Major Motes was slightly worried when he saw how alcoholic the party was going to be . Tonight he 'd have to let himself go a bit . After all , it was his promotion party . He 'd dispatch Stuki to pourp186every other glass out in the sand . In the clubhouse at Ain-Taya a keg of American beer was broached . It burst its staves , and one of the British majors lay down in the foamy flood on the tile floor and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chortled.  --  Character ! howled the American officers . The dinner was a relay affair , with one course served at each colonel 's villa around the hills of Algiers . The party would pile into jeeps and staff cars and screech through the streets from one villa to the next . They 'd have soup in Maison Carree and steak in Maison Blanche . Major Motes was a little envious , for he now knew that Casa was pretty small potatoes compared to the way The Boys lived at AFHQ . All officers of field grade had villas . In each the major noted the presence of a lovely Algerienne as hostess . The last course of dinner ended at 2200 hours . All the officers were in high spirits . They decided to round out the evening at the Center District Club of the Mediterranean Base Section , three blocks from the Aletti Hotel , near Algiers Harbor . Jeeps and staff and command cars tore through the blacked-out streets of Algiers , screaming at the French to get the hell off the roads . Captains and majors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an outing . Occasionally ( just for sport ) two jeeps would drive parallel till they were abreast . Then they 'd lock wheels . Just kids at heart.  --  I think I 'm going to be sick , Major Motes said into Stuki 's ear.  --  Now just ya hold on , chief . It 's all in ya imagination . . . . An say , ai n't this fun ? . . . We got ta leave that stinky Casa , huh ? We got ta move here an get in with these bigtime operators . The Center District Club was low and cool , hung with green and ocher chintzes . Service was by Italian prisoners of war in white linen coats . These stood behind the bar leaning on their elbows , their eyes misty with nostalgia . Seeing the P/W , Major Motes revivedfrom his rum dizziness and said impressively to a small circle :  --  Goddam it now , boys . Look at those goddam Dagos . Feeling sorry for themselves , as usual .... Do n't they like American rations ? A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A Negro band blared up . An elderly lieutenant colonel of the party lurched to his feet and cried whoopee . He grabbed the prettiestand youngest of the P/W waiters and pushed him into a tango over the floor among sparring junior officers and nurses and the girls of Algiers . From the club 's doorway came an MP to break up the clinch of the colonel and the Italian , who had begun to cry.  |p187Stuki  left Major Motes 's side and went to talk with the Italian bartenders . His mustache quivered with joy as his Italian poured out . Soon he came back to tell the major that their names were Otello and Enzo and Gabriele , and how he 'd upbraided them for declaring war on us , how he 'd taunted them for Mussolini and for betting on the wrong horse . In short Stuki 'd told those wops a thing or two . Presently the prisoners of war began to blubber and bawl as they drew the beer and rum . This brought out the sergeant and the officer in charge of the club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Call a strike , Ginsoes ! Stuki railed at them , his mustaches quivering with passion . I dare ya ! Call a strike . The G-2 section roosted on the edge of the dance floor , British and American mingled . Drinks kept coming and coming , the strongestsweetest rum , schooners of beer , tall emerald Tom Collinses . Major Motes 's stomach was squeezing like an accordion . So he sat where he could pour most of these libations into the base of the potted palm behind him . Toward midnight the Negro band got hotter and hotter . The girls of Algiers in the scented gloom of the dance floor lay across officers ' laps and submitted to long laughing embraces while their escorts ' hands tore at the straps of their gowns.  --  Ya livin , kids ! Stuki screamed over the brass and drums . Then a captain arose from his cane-bottomed chair and bounced 4t off the chintz-arrased wall.  --  Christ , but this place is dull ! I want action . So the party repaired to their jeeps and staff cars . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Algiers , where only thimbles of light showed through the trees on Rue Michelet . Then even these tiny landmarks flickered out . Sirens began to shriek all over Algiers . The convoy screeched to a stop . Two jeeps telescoped . All the officers wove or were carried out of their vehicles to the side of the road , where they threw themselves down on their faces in a culvert.  --  Bes thing in an air raid is a woman ! someone shouted with his mouth against the dirt . Where is she ? Beaucoup women , beaucoup dive bombers ! But no planes came over Algiers that night . Major Motes and Stuki landed at Cazes airfield and took the ATC bus into Casablanca . They had hangovers . It was the middle of the morning . The domes and finger-slim white apartment houses of the city glowed like solid geometry alive.  |  --  Ya got a ordeal aheada ya , chief , Stuki mumbled . Lieutenant Frank was waiting at the office with a clippedtogetherfile of typewritten paper . He chomped on his cigar and twisted at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stain over his left check . In the examination room Major Motes saw that the examiners were bent over their Stars and Stripes . There was peace with them . Nevertheless he called out a bright good morning . They glanced up and , noting the new gold leaf on his collar , blanched and blinked . He heard them whispering chaotically to one another as he took the document from Lieutenant Frank 's mottled hand and went behind the glass partition of the front office to scan it . He had to keep from trembling at his desk , for he knew that every eye was upon him . For the first time he cursed the glass wall of the front office that made him as vulnerable as a floodlighted thief . The report of the inspector general was a lengthy and detailed document . Before he settled down to reading it , he leafed through it for a skimming , lighting a cigarette with shaking all-thumbs and moistening the tip of his forefinger . He observed that nearly every officer and GI of his detachment had registered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fullness . He had the sixth carbon . Major Motes took an hour to read the report . He pored over it in a concentration of horror , just as a hypochondriac notes the symptoms of a disease in an encyclopedia and compares them with his own . His officers had complained to the IG that they enjoyed none of the prestige or authority of their commissions . Some mentioned having been humiliated by Lieutenant Frank in the presence of enlisted men . All agreed that the process of censoring mail had been reduced to a frightful and unnecessary drudgery . One used the expression that they were worse off than slaveys at sewing machines in a sweatshop . In the depositions of the officers there recurred the phrase Unholy Three , meaning Major Motes , Stuki , and LieutenantFrank . They were also called the Inner Circle . Others averred that the outfit was run in a style befitting a reform school for girls , with flagrant abuses occurring under a facade of being GI . There were protests against the freezing of transportation , whereas the Unholy Three used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swore that they were n't allowed to entertain ladies in their billets , but that Lieutenant Frank violated the order continually and with impunity.  |p189The  GI 's of the outfit had told the IG that they never knew where they stood with the officers . The sergeant major said that Captain Motes never looked him in the eyes when he gave him an order . Other GI 's said that some officers had drunk with them and played golf with them at Fedhala , while other officers would press court-martial charges without provocation . But the focus of all the pissing and moaning was that Captain Motes was a spineless commanding officer , that the disunity and confusion and cruelty of the detachment all stemmed from him , that he gave his orders through his mouthpiece , as though he himself were afraid and unsure . Major Motes began to exude an icy sweat when he got to the recommendations of the inspector general . There were three . That officers should not be forced to live so close together when off duty . That stricter demarcation he made between the treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound policies of leadership or else be removed from command of his detachments . He rose from his desk , made a giant effort to master the quaking of his nerves , and rushed out into the examination room with the IG report in his hand . There he summarily had an officers ' call . He read to all his examiners the report of the inspector general even to the recommendations , not sparing himself . When he 'd read the last sentence , with its implication of his being removed from command for incompetence , he laid his face in his hands and wept noisily.  --  Gentlemen , forgive me .... All I can say is that if we have had dirty linen in this detachment , we should have aired it together .. . but in privacy . He continued to sob snortingly for a full minute . Then a round of applause rippled through the examination room , and one officer got to his feet and called :  --  Major , you 're a man 's man . We 'll stand by you.  --  Let 's wipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , diving for his handkerchief.  --  Let bygones be bygones ! a roar went up through the room . The entire detachment entrained for Algiers . On the three-day train ride Major Motes busied himself creating new titles for almost all his officers . This one would be mess officer , this one soldier voting officer , another in charge of special service , another PX officer , another war bond officer . Major Motes rushedp190from car to car , personally distributing special orders and designationsand citations he 'd had the sergeant major type up . Thus with all the officers become something in their own eyes , the trip was made in a gala and phoenix spirit . He spoke much of the advance detail of specially trusted officers he 'd dispatched in trucks to Algiers to set up housekeeping . Yet when they detrained at Maison Blanche at the depot where they were to live , it was discovered that the advance detail had n't yet arrived . But Lieutenant Frank did some shouting and cigar chewing , and at last the dirty weary frayed detachment was permitted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band had finished its chow . For himself and Stuki he chose a pyramidal tent at the head of a blocked row close to the latrines . On the sand in front of it was an attempt at a lawn , colored pebbles and flowers plotted out by the Italian PAW who were their orderlies . Next morning Major Motes was awakened at moo hours by a full colonel standing over him and prodding him.  --  Stand at attention . Who the hell are you ? Major Motes scrambled out of his cot in his flowered pajamas.  --  You 're in charge of that censorship gang that moved in yesterday ? In the future you and all your detachment will stand reveille , like everyone else in this depot . We 're all in the army here.  --  But we 're a separate intelligence outfit . We 're simply billeted here for the convenience of AFHQ .. .  --  You heard me , the colonel yelled . I am in command of this depot . As long as you and your letter openers live in these tents , you 'll abide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his time at AFHQ offices in Algiers . He carried in his briefcase samples of comment sheets , which are extracts of violations found in troop mail . He was like a peddler going from door to door . He had a theory that military censorship still had n't the importance it deserved . By persistence he soon made his organization well known . Shortly afterwards , at his own request , there was transferred to his detachment one of the bright young men of AFHQ . This young officer told Major Motes that he could never forgive the war for interrupting his doctor 's dissertation in Erse philology . Lieutenant Mayberry sought out Major Motes every night . He was a short boyish second lieutenant with thin blond hair and an incisive baritone . He always carried with him Fowler 's Modern Endp191lish Usage . Before long Major Motes said to himself that Lieutenant Mayberry was the most cultivated and disciplined mind he 'd ever known . Each night he 'd root out the major and Stuki where they sat working late in their office , entering the Boyle hut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jacket and set down his Blue Book.  --  I 'm afraid , lieutenant , said Stuki languidly , that we ai n't good enough for ya here . We do n't know much about readin and writin.  --  Do you mind leaving us alone ? I have some business with your commanding officer . Lieutenant Mayberry had a way with Stuki as though he were n't even in the room.  --  Who tha hell ya talkin to ? Stuki shrilled . I know more about postal censorship than you do . . . . So ya better be nice to me ... . Besides I think ya pretty fresssssssh bargin in here this way . Nobody asked for your advice.  --  I appeal to you , sir , Lieutenant Mayberry cried to Major Motes with a Shakespearean gesture of outraged sensibility . This is a confidential matter I wish to discuss with you . So Stuki left the Boyle hut , his mustache working and his brown : yes sparking.  --  That fellow should change his hair oil , Lieutenant Mayberry said . I speak of him so frankly with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hearts you size him up the way I do . . . he 's a creature.  --  He means well , Major Motes said quickly.  --  Takes more than good intentions to win a war , as you and I know well , sir . . . . That fellow is what I 'd call a greaser . . . . Frankly , sir , do you trust Italo-Americans of the first generation ? Cloak and dagger , that 's all they are . . . . But why am I telling you these things ? Perhaps I lecture a little bit too much .... I 've just come tom working with inferior minds . I 've got into the habit of underscoringeverything I say . . . . Sir , I was delighted to be transferred to your command . I was getting sick of the intellectual stagnation of Algiers . Fed up with it . . . . Sir , I desire to place at your disposal certain talents which have so far been wasted . . . . Special skills suffer in the army , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . for you are a specialist.  --  Thank you , Major Motes said.  --  Do n't thank me for facts , sir . I do n't underestimate myself . And I speak thus frankly to you because I 've known you and heardp192of you as a man who lives by plain dealing . . . . I do n't pay oily compliments , sir . My semantic training has taught me the value of language . Oh sir , the waste that goes on in meanings in this modern world ! . . . With your permission ..  --  . Lieutenant Mayberry brought a folding metal chair to the desk and seated himself next the major under the green-hooded white light . Major Motes studied the thinning yellow hair , the tuft of yellow mustache , the slashed line of the mouth . The forehead was etched out in pool-like hollows , the pale blue eyes were hooded with thought . Lieutenant Mayberry opened a folder full of diagramsand figures.  --  Major , sir , in justice I must tell you that I know all about your unfortunate . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the files . And I said to myself , there 's a man being done to death . A modern Acteon . . . . My heart bled for you , sir.  --  The . . . incident . . . has all blown over , Major Motes said , making a vague pass at the air.  --  Thank God justice has been done , Lieutenant Mayberry murmured , devoutly lifting his eyes into the dark beyond the shaded light . His white hand moved over the figured sheets , which were full of lines and arrows and labeled boxes . There were also sheets of graph paper and canals in particolored crayon.  --  Now sir , work of your kind is enormously important to the Allied war effort . . . . But because censorship is essentially negative in action and results , it needs advertising and pictorial aids to keep it before the eyes and in the consciousness of the bigwigs in Algiers . Pardon the vulgarism . . . . Otherwise your valuable work gets lost in the shuffle of more voluble intelligence agencies.  --  I see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eying the patchwork quilt of graphs.  --  Of course you do , sir ; of course you do . . . . Now , do you get out a mimeographed monthly report ? Are you making the fullest possible use of charts and figures as visual aids ? . . . Think for example of the stunning effect on some stuffy brigadier general of a huge colored sketch on oilcloth , showing the ratio of V-mail read in relation to the number of ordinary letters , with legends and percentiles of the types of censorship violations . . . . Then you will of course forward carbons of your comment sheets to all user agencies . . . . Do you have punch headlines to attract the weary and wandering eye ? . . . Do you make appropriate use of underscoring and italics in order to  --  shall we say  --  slant the material ? Do you quote only sections that are pertinent ? . . . And have you arresting/looking buckslips to be returned from the offices concerned , showingwhat action has been taken , or whether they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As Lieutenant Mayberry talked , vistas fell open to Major Motes 's eyes . He saw that to this hour he had n't even tapped the potentialitiesof censorship . It was one of the most vital of all America 's secret weapons . The two men shook hands after a three-hour discussion . Major Motes was exhausted and thrilled by the controlled violence of Lieutenant Mayberry 's mind , by the clarity and ruthlessnessof his new young officer 's thinking . The following morning a desk was set up in the front office for Lieutenant Mayberry . Over his head was suspended a sign , letteredby an Italian P/W : REPORTS , RETURNS , AND STATISTICAL DIVISION . Stuki sat at his own field desk and glared and purred rawly . And all day long every error in Stuki 's grammar was pounced on by Lieutenant Mayberry , with Fowler 's book open to be cited as the authority . To all this Major Motes listened with pride and avidity . One day he gave Lieutenant Mayberry authority to wear his Phi Beta Kappa key on his watch chain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his new section chief , who 'd make slight emendations in their style.  --  You write a fine prose , sir . . . . But do read a little more Macaulay . It took less than a week for Lieutenant Mayberry to work drastic changes in the front office . He undertook first the rehabilitation of the enlisted clerks of the detachment . In his evenings ( he never went to Algiers for amusement or distraction ) he gave French lessons to several corporals from Baltimore , bending his blond mustache over them as they squirmed and parsed under the brilliantshaded lights . Then he made them read Francois Villon , saying that it would help them with their Algerian loves . Nor did the first sergeant or the sergeant major escape him . He waged a cultural war on them . First he made them feel ridiculous and loutish by working up a comedy campaign against them every time they took out their comic books from under their typewriters . In two weeks he 'd reduced them to such despair that they were spelling out Thomas Mann and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was always on his lips : I have been faithful to thee , Cynara , in my fashion . . . . He told the whole GI office force that than this poem there was nothing more magic or golden in all literature ; it was better than Joyce Kilmer or Henry WadsworthLongfellow.  | Lieutenant Mayberry said that the modern American language was falling apart from lack of discipline or surface tension . Thereforeas an antidote he insisted on a Victorian tautness and periodicityin all the prose emanating from his office . He organized a glee club for the officers and enlisted men of the detachment . Major Motes , observing that , while they sang , his command had the first unity of its army career , made attendance at glee club rehearsals compulsory to all . On nights when Lieutenant Mayberry bullied his choir through nigra spirituals in an abandonedmess hall , nobody got a pass to Algiers . But the noblest achievements were wrought at month 's end in the monthly censorship report that went to AFHQ . When this was in the mill , starting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself in the office till midnight and be unapproachable . It was miraculous what he could do with the detachment 's figures , which , unvarnished , were simply a list of the number of V-mails and ordinary letters read each month , violations of military security , and recommendations of new ground rules for postal censorship . What went to G-2 in Algiers was a tenpagemimeographed brochure accompanied by graphs , charts , arrows , slots of different altitudes and colors . And the history of the censorship detachment for each thirty days was set forth in gorgeousarmy-ese , with paragraphs commencing with such stately tidbits as :  --  Attention is directed to a chain of malfeasances by .. .  --  It is felt that such directives would irreparably condone .. . Major Motes had never been so happy or important or aware of his contribution to the war effort . He had frequent meetings with his officers in which he lashed them on to new heights of work and achievement . Officers who read fewer than five hundred letters a day were excoriated in Mayberry prose on the bulletin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wit remarked that the turning over of letters on the examination tables created a breeze which blew planes backwards at Maison Blanche airport . In his executive ecstasy Major Motes created still more posts for his officers . Nothing now was too good for them . He gave LieutenantMayberry a jeep all his own , which that officer christened under its windshield CYNARA in letters of Caslon style six inches high . Major Motes designated a club officer to open a little bar in an empty tent . He named an assistant recreational officer to preview all films to be shown to the detachment . There was only one fly now in the ointment : it was still difficult to get promotions for hisp195officers in relation to their just deserts . Reading their mail in the evenings , he noticed a rising tendency to bitch about promotions . Requests for transfer again mounted and had to cool off in his top desk drawer . One day Major Motes asked the A C of S G-2 to come and address his examiners . The colonel turned up and talked for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and railed and wept and tore at his iron-gray hair , saying how he himself would like very much to be a brigadier general , but how he too was making a sacrifice . And in a roaring peroration the colonel told the officers that there were richer rewards in the army than the outward one of changing the brass on their collars . He concluded :  --  Ah , gentlemen , gentlemen ! When your babies cluster around your knee and ask , Daddy , what did you do to help win the war ? you can bow your heads without shame and say , Son , I had the hardest job of all . I was in the intelligence service of the Army of the United States ... . In May , 1944 , pressure was put on AFHQ by Washington . It was felt that there were in North Africa altogether too many officers and enlisted men hanging around the base sections with nothing to do but keep meaningless office hours , put their feet on their desks , and read Stars and Stripes . Many of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Italian front as infantry replacements . The general officers of AFHQ went into a panic . Had n't they figured on huge commands simply to take up the slack , on the principle that a team must have many substitutes on the bench ? But the reckoning came to AFHQ , in the persons of inspectinggenerals flown to Algiers from the Pentagon . They represented the War Manpower Commission , and they came with the convictionalready implanted in them that work in the Algiers area could be realized with a cut of one-third of the personnel . When Major Motes got a phone call that a brigadier general of WMC would visit his detachment that afternoon , he held a conference in the front office . Present were Stuki , Lieutenant Frank , and Lieutenant Mayberry.  --  Goddam it , what am I going to do ? Major Motes screamed in executive anguish . They 'll cut half the detachment . I simply ca n't get along on a skeleton office force . You all know how vital our work is . . . . There was some hasty whispering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examination room ,  | bit his cigar , called for the officers ' attention , and said in a curdling voice :  --  News item : They 're hard up in Italy for infantry replacements . If they do n't find those replacements damn quick , they 're gon na start pickin em outa the hat . Here for instance . . . . Those of ya who wish to volunteer for combat kindly step into the front office after this meetin is over . . . . Ya 'll get six weeks training an then be sent to tha Eyetalian front . . . . After all we got ta take Rome , ai n't we ? . . . An I know that some a ya feel ya could make a more important contribution than ya been makin . . . . Like leadin a platoon inta a chatterin machine-gun nest ... . Almost immediately a fat looie tottered into the front office . He dragged Major Motes into one of the shed latrines . He gibbered and sobbed :  --  Major , lissen . . . I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. . An there 's sonsabitches out in that room ud cut ya throat . . . . Single guys . Now I got ta wife an two kids I ai n't never seen . . . . I wan na go back to em in one piece , see ? . . . Ya would n't , ya could n't .. .  --  I understand , I understand , goddam it , Major Motes said hoarsely , wringing the officer 's hand . And after noon chow there turned up a brigadier general from the War Manpower Commission in an olive-drab staff car , with a pretty WAC sergeant for a secretary and a covey of aides with clipboards . Meanwhile Lieutenant Mayberry and Stuki were busy in the examination room . They dumped all the mailbags on the reading tables , so that each examiner , when he returned from lunch , would find himself surrounded with sufficient mail to censor for the next month . They piled the mail on three sides of each examiner 's field desk . When they 'd finished , each desk looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructions , the general was standing in the front office , haranguing Major Motes and LieutenantFrank , who 'd offered him a fine chunky cigar  --  We 're convinced back in the Pentagon , said the general , nibblingat the tip of the cigar , that something funny is going on over here . We believe that many overseas headquarters are something of a war crime in themselves . They tend to get bigger and bigger , like a snowball .... While on the Italian front there 's a critical shortage of infantrymen . We suspect that Allied Force Headquarters is ridiculously overstaffed.  --  Well , sir , I know only my own outfit , Major Motes said meekly.  |p197A  good commanding officer must stay at home and tend to his own washing.  --  There must be some of your personnel you feel you can get rid of , the general roared.  --  Will the general look at my poor clerks ? the major moaned , gesturing at rows of corporals who were beating the life out of their typewriters . Sir , a good officer thinks of his GI 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , I have n't been able to give them an Algiers pass this week .... They have to work nights . . . beg to , poor devils . . . . And I 've got three officers in the hospital , sir ... nervous breakdowns .. . overwork.  --  Let me see the room where the mail is read , said the general.  --  Let me impress upon the general that everything he 's about to see is strictly confidential . . . . Examination of personal mail is the privilege and the responsibility of the cream of American commissionedofficers . The general blew out a tuberose of cigar smoke . The major stepped aside to let him pass into the examination room . Here there was the silence of a library . The head of each examiner could barely be seen over the top of the litter of letters that Stuki and Lieutenant Mayberry had piled on the field desks . It looked like Christmas Eve in a post office.  --  O my God ! the general said softly . Do n't envy those poor fellows . Read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them , major ?  --  Quite normal , sir . . . . Perhaps when the general goes back to Washington , he may remember to mention in his report officers he saw who never make the headlines or the Purple Heart , but who just as surely were giving their eyes in the service of their country . The brigadier general later left , muttering apologetically that Major Motes did indeed need a larger staff , and that himself would personally see what could be done . Lieutenant Frank told the examiners that they might take the rest of the afternoon off :  --  But do n't go tattlin to ya little friends in Algiers about what happened here this afternoon . . . if ya wise . . . . That general wanted to send ya all to the Eyetalian front and replace ya with WAC 's .... Not that they could n't do a better job ... . Major Motes 's triumph of the day was complete when Algiers phoned at i600 hours to state that Lieutenant Mayberry was now a first lieutenant and Lieutenant Frank a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a set of silver tracks and pinned them on himself.  |  --  Seventeen months of sweating he bellowed . An I got gold leaves bought too.  --  I have no silver bars , Lieutenant Mayberry murmured piteouslyto himself . I did n't come overseas expecting to be promoted.  --  Well , I ai n't got no extras to giveya , Stuki said , yellow under his tan . Like a bridegroom bull Captain Frank hurtled around the front office :  --  So they called me a permanent first , hey ? He then ripped the old silver bars off his cap and off his field jacket and threw them like deadly little brooches with the pins open at Lieutenant Mayberry , who caught them humbly , his eyes shining thankfulness , his blond mustache rampant.  --  Take em take em take em .... Ya can shove em up if ya like ... . Major Motes was n't a great one for wasting the pay of the army . but his Virginia sense told him that tonight was the unavoidable occasion for a party . Promotion parties are simply de rigueur to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayberry , and Captain Frank to be his guests for the evening . They got into his jeep with festive solemnity and headed for Algiers . Even as he drove , Major Motes was aware that Stuki was brooding because he had n't been promoted too.  --  A few more months yet , he said cheerily in Stuki 's ear , laying his hand consolingly on his roommate 's arm.  --  Few more months , balls , Stuki said with feeling . At first Major Motes wondered whether he could get away with taking them all to the TAM mess , paying five francs for each , and throwing in two bottles of white wine . But as they descended into Algiers where in the blue water the hospital ships were falling and heaving under the barrage balloons , he knew he could n't get away with that for a promotion party . So he took them to a black market restaurant off Rue d'Isly , where for two thousand francs they got a peasant soup , eggs , a thin steak , a salad , pastry baked without sugar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stuki leered . Betcha glad they do n't come around too often , huh , chief ? Then they picked up in the jeep Captain Frank 's Algiers mistress , a huge and vociferous French girl with hair under her arms . When she saw her lover 's new insignia , she screamed and ran her tongue over his thick purple lips . The final touch in Major Motes 's hospitality was an invitation to the Center District Club for drinks . He himself got nervous and broody as usual with alcohol . But hep199pretended for the occasion 's sake that he was having mad fun , even to nudging the mistress once , for which she goosed him feelingly and invited him up some evening when her capitaine could n't come . Then all except Major Motes got drunk on PAW gin . Captain Frank believed himself Napoleon , putting his cap on sidewise and sticking a hand inside his meaty chest . Lieutenant Mayberry lecturedon the English language as distinct from Americanese . And Stuki just drank and drank till the tears dribbled off his mustache into his gin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets of Algiers to cruise up a little heavy lovin . On Saturday morning 31 July 1944 , Major Motes first saw the city of Naples checkered in the sunlight . Over the bay rode the smell of all the world 's garbage.  --  My ole man started out from this burg , Stuki said . His ole man put him on a boat when he was eleven . Told him to shift for himself , he did n't never wan na see his puss again . . . . Now I 'm comin back to Napoli . I 'll show em they could n't treat my ole man the way they did.  --  All your relatives ' houses will be off limits anyhow , Lieutenant Mayberry said . So you 'll be spared the trouble of a courtesy call on them . . . . I smell that pasta and hair oil already . It took six hours to unload the ship . It was late afternoon when they and their baggage rattled out of the barbed wire round the port . Major Motes appraised the ruin around Naples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happens to people who declare war on Uncle Sam ? Lieutenant Mayberry wondered aloud :  --  I wonder how many greasers are still lying under that rubble ? ... Well , Italy always was overpopulated . Musso sends the birth rate up , so we choose our own means of bringing it down.  --  That 's what they get for kickin my ole man out , Stuki said , tweaking his mustache in approbation . So now I 'll stamp all over their ole ruins .... My ole man says Italy always did have too many monuments . Captain Frank looked at the carts picking through the narrower streets.  --  So I left my baby doll in Algiers for this .... Well , guess there 'll be choicer pickins here , though . When Major Motes first saw it at the end of July , 1944 , Naples was a steaming and shattered anthill committed to some furious project . Besides the Neapolitans , the streets were mad with Allied soldiers . He felt already faint from the heat . They drove to the palazzo where their offices were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone and balconies that had once housed offices and German companies . On its four floors room after room yearned out emptily , echoing rooms with painted plaster and nothing else but rubble in them . He and his party climbed to the roof of the palazzo , which was a flat square of gravel girdled with a railing . They could see the shrill blue of the Bay of Naples . To their rear was a column and a heap of plaster shag from which flowers were already poking out their heads like war orphans . To their right was a church where the bombs had ripped away half the wall ; they saw the statues and the benches and the organpipes and the tattered winy draperies that once sheathed the arches . To their left was the turn of an alley from which rose the steam of urine vaporizing in the sun . Here stood a queue of GI 's waiting at the entrance to a house . Girls peeped out from its tiny balconies on the second floor ; screaming children were hawking the charms to be bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's were in constant motion . They 'd posted watches against the coming of MP 's . Captain Frank watched this shifting line with interest . Finally he leaned his paunch in its pink trousers over the railing of the roof terrace and hooted paternally at the GI 's :  --  Oooh you VD ! Lieutenant Mayberry looked out over the housetops , heavy with his sense of history and of time :  --  That 's the Italy of the guidebooks and paintings for you : a cat house next door to a church.  --  It stinks , Stuki said , holding his nose over his mustache . I see why my ole man never came back to it.  --  I feel , the major said , that our organization is going into a new and brilliant phase here in Naples . . . . I want you all to share my triumphs . Early in August , 1944 , Major Motes 's palazzo opened for business . He 'd made it the headquarters for most of the censorship in meridian Italy . He 'd screened out hordes of Italian civilians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lire a week : refugees from Trieste , penniless students of the University of Naples , pale Jews who 'd hidden from pillar to post in Italy . And Major Motes got them all seated at long examination tables in hushed rooms under hard lights . He locked the massive woodenp201doors on them and labeled the entrances with secret designations . Inside these inquisitorial rooms the furren examiners unfolded the long green sheets of the provost marshal general and read :  --  Carissima mamma , io sto bene , e cosi spero di to e dell'intera famiglia .. . or  --  Was ich auch von dir hoffethose twenty-four lines which Ital ' -i and German P/W wrote their families each week by permission of she Geneva Convention . These furren examiners brought their lunches to work wrapped in old copies of Risorgimento : black bread and cheese . Soon they petitionedfor American rations to be served as the noon meal , since they were now in the employ of the United States Army.  --  Those Ginsoes expect us to serve em a lunch ! Stuki cried.  --  The only logical position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wolf , sucking her teats like Romulus and Remus.  --  They 're like nigras and must be kept in their place , Major Motes said . But since so many of the Italians fainted away at their work under the hard lights in the airless examination rooms , he promised to try for a GI food issue . To himself , however , he declared that he 'd never lift a finger to help feed a people which had declared war on the United States and which had been the turncoat traitors of Europe throughout their history . More Italians fainted while censoring the mail , and more were hired to take their places : dottori and professori and geometri and ragionieri and studenti . Next it was arranged that the Italians and the American officers should dine and be released at different hours in order that they should never meet to make friends or compare notes on the winding staircase of the palazzo . And often in the afternoons Major Motes would stand in the cortile of the palazzo to watch his workers streaming out when the bell set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skidded along in sandals and shorts carrying their umbrellas . The American officers looked like moles coming from underground and rubbing the itching of their eyes . Major Motes got to feel like Henry Ford watching his plants empty at the changeoverof a shift . By trips to Caserta and crying on colonel 's desks and pleading with section chiefs , Major Motes got Stuki and Lieutenant Mayberrypromoted to captaincies . Mayberry said his own cap would get too small if the major did n't stop being so kind . And Stuki in his shining double bars presided over rooms of gray brooding Italians reading P/W mail . One examination room opened into the next . From his high rostrum Stuki looked like a master in study hall tyrannizing over the bowed heads , the thick lenses of the spectacles , the shabby dandruffed shoulders . He sat all day long on this dais screaming exhortations at his slaves , lecturing on Italy 's political perfidy , or tapping with the eraser of his pencil while he scribbled V-mails to his Mom informing her that he 'd at last got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of . Stuki loved to fire Neapolitans for the slightest laxness in their duties . If they asked for half an hour off to go to the questura to bail out their sisters on charges of prostitution , he fired them for goldbricking . If they fainted from hunger at their work , he gave them the sack for shirking their duty to the United States , which had liberated them.  --  Perche avete buttato fuori mio Papa , eh ? he would cry . Considering the huge office force under his control , Major Motes rejoiced that there were so few incidents . One afternoon on the second floor some Austrian refugees beat up an Italian Jew who was reading P/W mail in German . Major Motes arrived on the scene with his interpreter , the sergeant major , and two MP 's from the questura . All the offenders were fired and jailed for investigationand trial by AMG in the Provincia Building.  --  More screening , that 's the answer , Major Motes told higher headquarters at AFHQ in Caserta.  --  What a comedy , Captain Mayberry said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ago the Italians were at war with us . Now they 're reading the mail of their own prisoners of war ... . What an obscene comedy.  --  The whole war is obscene , goddam it , Major Motes said . All Europe and its parasitic population are obscene . . . like the nigras ... . On the ground floor of the palazzo Major Motes established a mess hall for the American personnel , a barbershop , and a glassed-in booth where an armed guard sat and frisked all the furren help when they came to work in the morning and left in the evening . At noon the Neapolitans pressed their noses against the screen door of the mess and watched everything the Americans lifted to their mouths . Some of them wept when they saw half-eaten dishes dumped into GI cans.  --  Set up garbage pails in the cortile ! Stuki railed . Let em dive for the food we waste ! That ought a nourish the bastards !  |p203When  he was n't necking the panties off the signorina in his office , Captain Frank amused himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his window . He 'd stand smoking his cigar and holding a pail of water . Every Neapolitan who relievedhimself against the wall below this window got a bucket of water dumped on his head . Major Motes wrote Lucinda that ha-ha , they were teaching the Neapolitans a little practical sanitation . Major Motes was the first at the door of the palazzo in the morning . Some evenings he stayed till midnight . There was n't a place in the palazzo where his quick step might n't be heard at any moment . He 'd peer with pride at his jeeps and trucks in their rows in the inner cortile , at the mailbags ferried in and out of the great double-gated portone . And he observed the stream of Italians and American officers swarming up and down the staircase , which he called Jacob 's Ladder in a V-mail to Lucinda . In the daylight hours there was always in his palazzo a combination hum and silence , a clatter of typewriters and that air of concentration and mystery befitting the intelligence service of the United States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dream . He alone had realized it . As one of the leading censorship officers in the Mediterranean theater he was invited to visit the front , attached to the 34th Division . It would mean a month 's absence from Naples and his clockwork command , but he left Stuki and Captain Frank in charge . He spent a week rubbing dubbin into his combat boots and having officers ' calls in which he told them how lucky they were to be in the security of Naples . But at the last moment his orders were canceled because Caserta said that the Arno front was far too risky and his own life too precious for a German bullet . Captain Mayberry said one morning :  --  My work here is almost done.  --  You belong to this outfit , Major Motes replied tenderly . You helped build it up . . . . Surely you do n't want to leave me ?  --  It 's not that , sir , Captain Mayberry said , stroking his thin blond hair . But I thought I might ask for a transfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . I thought perhaps they might hide me away out there in some obscure little job in documents.  --  Goddam it , what are you up to ? Major Motes cried like a stricken mother . Do n't think you 'll get your majority any easier out at Caserta . Besides , they have n't even made me a lieutenant colonel yet.  |  --  You know I do n't think in terms of promotion , Captain Mayberrysaid . But my ancestors were pioneers . I want something new.  --  Well , just do n't try to pull any fine Italian deals to get out of this outfit . In the next few days Captain Mayberry drove often to Caserta in his jeep . He said AFHQ was no longer satisfied with the reports over which he slaved . Would Major Motes please transfer him to a quieter and easier job ? He was terribly weary , he said.  --  You 're up to something , Major Motes said accusingly.  --  Besides , sir , have you looked at your hair ? It 's almost white . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have a terrible twitch too , sir . . . you 're eligible for rotation to the United States . . . your wife ... Major Motes felt his scalp prickle :  --  Goddam it , how can anyone think of going home when this frightful war is still on ?  --  We must all be selfish , even in our unselfishnesses , Captain Mayberry replied . That very week Major Motes 's heart broke . An order came down from Caserta returning him to the United States for rotation . He was relieved of all his command in Italy . Captain Mayberry and Captain Frank were transferred to Caserta . Stuki was to take over Major Motes 's own duties.  --  Sorry to see ya go , chief , Stuki said , taking his arm carelessly .  --  Sure you can keep things running here ? Major Motes begged , stuttering more than ever.  --  Oh boy , can I ! . . . Let me say now that ya 've been just a little too easy around here . I got a few new policies I 'm gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . After all , chief , ya did n't know the languages ya was workin with . . . maybe that 's why they gave ya the air . He wrote Lucinda that he was coming home to her for a little rest . Nervous exhaustion . He spoke of the perfidies of Stuki , of Captains Frank and Mayberry , to all of whom he 'd given their start , out of pure benevolence . But then the army was full of opportunists and fingermen . On his last night in Naples before sailing , Major Motes walked alone in the Galleria Umberto . It was after sunset , the first time he 'd been alone with himself since that hotel room in Casa almost two years ago . The Galleria was full of Neapolitans , of Americans on leave from the hospitals at Bagnoli . The bars were full , even to the chairs on the pavements . Everywhere there were girls and oldp205women screeching and selling and sweeping . Little boys tore around making deals with GI 's , buying their cigarettes and selling them phallic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mirror in one of the bars  --  white-haired , quite stooped , his walk unsteady , a tic under his left eye . On his left shoulder was the red bull of the 34th Division he 'd sewed on when he thought he was going to inspect the front . He kept telling himself that men all over the world had died in this war , whereas he himself was only older and wiser and full of a bottomless grief . Goddam it , he said , fraternally clapping a lounging GI on the shoulder , who started this war anyway ?  --  Sir , if I was a major like you , I would n't even care . Major Motes walked and walked in the Galleria Umberto till the moon rose over Vesuvius and a pale light rippled through the glassless frames of the domed roof . People came and went , drunks flopped against the archways , girls were chased into black alcoves . But for all the heat that remained over Naples in the dark , he felt icy and empty and alone . He lit a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left eye set up a crackling along the socket . His heart was broken.  --  Guess I 'm out of my time , he said to himself . I 'm a gentleman from Virginia . Such must suffer in Naples of August , 1944 . This thought comforted Major Motes . When he got home , he 'd go to the Pentagon and sell them the idea of setting up censorship among civilians in the United States . Americans could n't trust even one another in wartime.  |p206REMEMBER  THAT ITALY IN AUGUST , 1944 , LAY OFF OUR PORTlike a golden porpoise lapped in dawn . She had eggs and lumpson her outline which the sun and the light mist grossened into wens . From nearer I made them out to be the island of Capri and the volcano Vesuvius . I peered with more interest than I had at Africa , for I had precise and confused ideas of what Italy 'd be like . I remember how in my head and in my heart the city of Naples had always nestled like a sleeping question mark , as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Life . I knew it would be a port town , but a port town over which lay a color and a weight peculiarly Naples ' own , a short girl with dark eyes and rich skin and body hair . Motherhood . Huge and inscrutable as the feminine Idea . In August , 1944 , the port of Naples was a flytrap of bustle and efficiency and robbery in the midst of ruin and panic . Images of disaster lay about the harbor : ships sunk at their berths , shattered unloading machinery , pumiced tenements along the docks . And back of this lunette the island of Capri sheered out of the bay , a sunny yellow bulkhead . Vesuvius smoked softly and solemnly , the way a philosophic plumber does at a wake . The Bay of Naples was crammed with Liberty ships and boats with red crosses on their sides and decks . Out Bagnoli way among the laurels and the myrtles landing craft infantry thumped up and down in the water.  --  I do n't like to look at bombed buildings , the pfc said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will shut out the view.  --  Ten months ago , the mess sergeant said , these greasy bastards were still hearin sirens and gettin pasted . I remember how the blue of the Mediterranean shaded into grayp207or rainbowed oil around the berths . Everything floated near the piers : watermelons , condoms , chunks of fissured wood , strips of faded cloth.  --  Europe drains into the Bay of Naples , the pfc said . And I remember the jeeps along Via Caracciolo near the section of Santa Lucia , and how Zi ' Teresa 's restaurant jutting on a small float was then a French officers ' mess , and the tunnel to Bagnoli . I remember whizzing past the statues of the aquarium , the war monuments ( Napoli ai suoi caduti ) that stared out to sea in the sunlight as stiff and superannuated as warriors on the porch of an old-soldiers ' home . The sunlight gives Naples a hardness and a mercilessness . It pokes its realistic fingers into the bombed buildingsby Navy House . In the half shot houses what plaster yet remainsin the eaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just over Naples stand the hills where the Vomero sits on its snaky terraces and flights of stairs like an old lady precarious on a trapeze . The houses of Naples as they swarm up the hillside are yellow or creamy or brown ; they get lost in the verdure that mustaches the lips of Castel Sant'Elmo . I could n't place Naples in any century because it had a taste at once modern and medieval , all grown together in weariness and urgency and disgust . Yet even in her half-death Naples is alive and furious with herself and with life . The hillside on which she lies , legs open like a drunken trollop , trembles when she turns on her fan bed . I remember too that at midday , when she was sleepiest of all in the lurid heat , she was a symbol of life itself , resentful and spiteful and cursing , yet very tender in her ruin.  --  I do n't care what anybody says , the corporal said , this is a terrific town . Absolutely terrific . There 's something here that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naples ai n't just a city , like St. Louis or Omaha . There 's it , the mess sergeant said . Look at them skirts jigglin over them rears . I remember that along Via Caracciolo thousands of people strolled in the late afternon . There came a hot wind off the bay that ruffled the buttocks and the marvelous breasts of the Italian women . It mussed their black thick hair . Everyone walked arm in arm , talking , laughing , crying , shouting , gesticulating . I remember the shabbiness of Neapolitan suits , different from the shine on the seats of American pants . I remember the mourning bands on the lapels of the Neapolitan men . I remember Neapolitan shoes  --   | when there were any  --  cracked or sprouting or leaking , of sick flashy leather like the cheeks of the feverish . I remember the lipstick and powder that the women used  --  when they could get any  --  of the tint of fevered blood . I remember the dark pallidity of those girls who could get none . I remember the glistening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their heads , and their legs , which seemed often to be skinned in dewy feathers . I remember the walls along Piazza Municipio , stuck with movie posters and the yellow playbills of the San Carlo and the Italian review Febbre Azzurra , or " Prossimamente Greer Garson in Prigionieridel Passato , " and Charlie Chaplin in Il Grande Dittatore , and Napoli Milionaria , and Sofa So ' . And the shops with their windows half-empty , with their scant goods cutely spread out to fake a display :  --  Prezzi sbalordativi ... .  --  Riduzioni del 20% . . . . Or the bookstores where Louisa May Alcott became Piccole Donne , where paper-bound ocher books lay in carts like cheeses on their sides , where Benedetto Croce was bedfellow with old copies of Life and that bitching Roman periodical Marforio , with nude girls prancing on the cover . And in every street and vico the little rafts on wheels selling shoelaces , and combs that shattered when they touched my scalp . And how bottles were sawed down to make glasses and vases , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the food stores.  --  Oggi si vende ... .  --  Si distribuisce sale . .. .  --  Non si riparano gomme per mancanza di materiale. .  --  Lo spaccio , la tessera ... . I remember the San Carlo Opera House on the corner by the traffic island , across the street from a pro station  --  its 1743 A.D. arches , its lines sweating out opera and ballet at thirty-five lire . Near it the palazzo where the Limeys took their tea and the British officers got drunk on their roof terrace and poured gin on pedestrianspassing into the Galleria Umberto . And I remember that every vico and salita had a different smell . Along Via Roma there was the color of movement : the OD 's of the combat troops , the rusty shorts of the UK , the melting splotches of the Neapolitan housewives ' house dresses , the patter of sandals , the click of hobnails , the squunch of children 's brown bare soles as they begged , pimped , screamed , tugged , cried , and offered . On Via Roma there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of ice cream withp209phony flavors and colors , of musty dry goods gloated over by the padrone behind his bars against thieves . Out of every alley in Naples the whiff of a thousand years of life and death and bed sheets and urination . The glass over the colored picture of the Madonna of Torre Annunziata . The clinking of the gratings on the balconies . And especially that small basket being hauled up and down many stories on its string , pulling up newspapers and groceries and the baby . Each alley had a different stench from many families with their own residua of body excretion , sweat , halitosis , and dandruff . And I remember alley after alley winding off Via Roma like a bowel , each with its off-limits sign . All I could see of them was the entrance , a flash of cobblestones , a turn of sunlight , and the scarred face of a wall shutting off all further exploration.  --  I 'm lost in Naples , said the pfc . Life has struck me in the face like a flounder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember making acquaintance with Italian . At first all I heard in Naples was asssshpett and capeeesh and payyysannn . But after a few days it broke down into something more articulate . Italian ( not Neapolitan dialect ) can soon be understood because it sounds like what it 's saying . Italian is a language as natural as the human breath . Italian is a feminine and flowing tongue in which the endings fill up the pauses , covering those gaps and gaucheries of conversation that embarrass Americans and British . It 's a language whose inertia has remained on the plus side . It keeps in motion by its own inherent drive . The Italians are never silent with one another . It is n't necessary even to think in this lovely language , for your breath comes and goes anyhow , and you might just as well use it to talk with . And good loving talk ! If you 've nothing to say , ehhh and senz'altro and per forza and per questo are always tumbling from your lips to prevent the flow from getting static . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumble of the Italian past subjunctive , like smoke turning on itself :  --  Se io andassi o se to potessi . I remember that Italian used to amuse me till it caught me in its silken web . I remember how kind the Neapolitans were to me when I was learning it , the sweetness of their grammatical corrections , the look of joy on an Italian 's face when you address him in his tongue , however poorly . Italian is the most sociable and Christianlanguage in this world . It 's full of a bubble like laughter . Yet it 's capable of power and bitterness . It has nouns that tick off a personality as neatly as a wisecrack . It 's a language in which the voice runs to all levels . You all but sing , and you work off your passion with your hands.  |  --  Io andare a casa tua per mangiare e per fare amore . . . finito capito amato andato venduto . . . . Capeeesh ? ... Molto buono , no buono , acqua fresca ... . I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human a language might disappear from the world because of the pattern of conquest . Italian is an atavistic language . All the rest have been visited by some torture or trickery or introspection . Italian alone is the language of the moment , cunning yet unpremeditated . I learned Italian in order to make love . And I found Italian feminine and secret and grave and puzzled and laughing , like a woman . Perhaps it came from the tit of Signora Eve in the Garden . For Italian is like milk and butter , sauced with some pepper lest it cloy you with its sweetness . Once Italian got into my palate , I remember , it never again left me . So I learned Italian in Naples . I remember also the dialect of the city of Naples , which is Italian chewed to shreds in the mouth of a hungry man . It varies even within the city . The fishermen in the bay talk differently from the rich in the Vomero . Every six blocks in the squashedtogethercity there 's a new dialect . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's as raw as tenement living , as mercurial as a thief to your face , as tender as the flesh on the breast . Sometimesin one sentence it 's all three . The stateliness of Tuscan Italian is missing in Neapolitan . But there 's no false stateliness in Naples either , except in some alien fountain presented by a Duchess of Lombardy . Neapolitan dialect is n't ornamental . Its endings have been amputated just as Neapolitan living pares to the F . : art and hardness of life . Wild sandwiches occur in the middle of words , doublings of z 's , cramming of m 's and n 's . When they say something , the Neapolitans scream and moan and stab and hug and vituperate . All at once . And 0 God , their gestures ! The hand before the groin , the finger under the chin , the cluckings , the headshakings . In each sentence they seem to recapitulate all the emotionsthat human beings know . They die and live and faint and desire and despair . I remember the dialect of Naples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . It came out of the fierce sun over the bleached and smelly roofs , the heavy night , childbirth , starvation , and death . I remember too the tongues that spoke Neapolitan to me : the humorous , the sly , the gentle , the anguished , the merciful , and the murderous . Those tongues that spoke it were like lizards warm in the sun , jiggling their tails because they were alive.  |  --  I have hoid , said the mess sergeant , teasing a Neapolitan child with a chocolate bar , that da wimmin are purtier in Nort Italy . But ya ca n't trump da build on da Neapolitan goils . Nuttin but rear ends bouncin like Jello and milk factories under dere dresses . I 'm goin crazy for it . I remember how the women and girls of Naples stood for all the women and girls of the world . There were girls like the Kresge and Woolworth pigs of Joisey City , with their hair not quite combed and dark and too long . Under this fluffy frowzy rat's-nest they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design or jewel . And there were the girls of the Vomero , of the strangling middle class , who were rushed along Via Roma on their mothers ' arms , girls who were locked up after nightfall when they 'd come in from their classes at the university . Now they were studentesse , but soon they 'd be dottoresse : Un libro di latino Per un giovinottino .. . They were like pretty mice in cotton dresses as they whisked by me with their chaperones . Sometimes I caught their eyes on the oblique when Mamma was looking the other way , eyes demure and hypocritical , eyes shooting feudal disdain for the poorer Italian women , eyes masking jealousy and curiosity of those lower Neapolitan women who went with gli alleati . And there were also a few , very few Neapolitan women who reminded me of the blaringindependence of American girls , who promenaded slowly through the street , well made up , their hair a little lighter , their legs a little daintier , their dresses fresh and trim . And once in a while I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the fascists and was now doing likewise with gli alleati . These were slim and forty and chic . They could be seen all over Europe , not just in Naples . And there were also the widows of Naples with their canes and sober bags . But most ubiquitous on Via Roma were those signurrine who chewed gum and had forgotten how to speak Italian . These walked always in pairs , and they screeched American obscenities at one another , taught them by some armored force sergeant in heat . They called every American Joe , and they knew " Stardust " and " Chattanooga Choo-Choo . " They knew the words better than I did . But I remember best of all the children of Naples . The scugnizz ' . Naples is the greatest baby plant in the world . Once they come off the assembly line , they lose no time getting onto the streets . They learn to walk and talk in the gutters . Many of them seem to live there . As the curfew was progressively lifted to a later and later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sidewalks . If I had to keep in my memory just one picture of the Neapolitan kaleidoscope , it would be of a brother and sister , never over ten years of age , sleeping on a curbstone in the sunlight with a piece of chewed dark bread beside them . Sometimes I thought that in Naples the order of bees and human beings was upside down , that the children supported and brought up their parents . Once I remember attempting to count the number of shoeshine boys between Via Diaz and the Galleria Umberto . I never could , for new shoeshine stands opened behind my back by the time I 'd walked ten feet . Those incredible scugnizz ' ! They were n't children at all , the scugnizz ' , but sorrowful wise mocking gremlins . They sold Yank and Stars and Stripes . They lurked outside the PX to buy my rations . They pimped for their sisters , who stood looking out at me from behind the balcony of a primo piano tenement . They sold charms and divisional insignia in the streets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but tasted like grilled papier-mache . They stole everything with a brilliance and furtiveness and constancy that made me think of old Ayrab fairy tales . They shrilled and railed at me in perfect and scouring American , as though they 'd learned it from some sailor lying in a gutter and hollering holy hell to ease his heart . The children of Naples were determined not to die , with the determination in which corpuscles mass to fight a virus that has invaded them . They owned the vitality of the damned . And they laughed at me , themselves , the whole world . Often I thought that we , the conquering army , were weaker and Biller than they . I loved the scugnizz ' because I had no illusions about them.  --  Wan na eat , Joe ?  --  Wan na souvenir of Naples ?  --  Wan na drink , Joe ?  --  Wan na nice signorina ? Wan na piecea arse ?  --  The kids are so dirty , the corporal said . But they have such fine teeth and eyes and skin . . . like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An they 're smart as whips . Look at the way they 've learned American just so they can buy an sell to us . . . . An , Christ , what can ya do when the poor little tykes stand outside ya mess and watch ya dumpin out GI food that somebody 's wasted ? The MP 's wo n't let ya feed em . Why ? Why ?  |  --  I suppose , said the pfc , that these children are responsible for Mussolini ? that the babies of Naples supported Farinacci and Badoglio and the house of Savoy and the vested interests of Turin and Milan ?  --  Ya go crazy if ya study on it too much , said the corporal.  --  Las night , the mess sergeant said , I seen two marines come outa the docks . An they met up with two signorinas of about eleven or twelve . Ya ca n't tell . They become wimmin so young here ... . Start em young , I always say.  --  Well , I guess the good must suffer with the bad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  If the Bible says that , said the pfc , Hitler should have burnt it too . I remember the levels and terraces of Naples , slipping from the Vomero into the bay . I 'd go from the bottom of the town to the top of the funiculars , which slide under the hillside on cables . Everybody fought their way into the cars in the stations . Then you skied along the wire . Sometimes you came into the light between two palazzi . Sometimes you scudded through a brief tunnel . Everyone 's shoulder was against everyone else 's gut . In the spells of darkness I 'd reassure myself that my Ayrab wallet was still in my pocket . In the dark the storm of Neapolitan dialect went on :  --  Di , Pino , hai portato tua moglie Pina ? Or I remember sometimes being stranded in the Vomero . For the funiculars stopped running at 2ioo hours . The Neapolitans believed that the force of gravity ceased at sundown . Then it became a problem of descent down stairs that I could n't even see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty flights and levels . God help me when I got caught at the top without a flashlight ! It meant groping along the dank walls of the houses , of gaugingmy step on stairs set at a pitch I could n't walk or run : about one and a half times the normal stride . Each stairway had a different gauge , and each angle was different . It was like walking into a cellar of smells and secret life , for out of the houses over my head came the sound of GI 's haggling for vino after hours , of women slapped and cursed by their husbands , of children eating their pasta . Sometimes I remember how across the path of my uncertain descent a light would fall athwart the mossy chipped stairs from an ill-closed door . Or a woman and her child would appear in the spectrum . Even as I stumbled down , I wondered what they were thinking . A piece of their lives had fallen across my way in an ax of radiation . Sometimes around midnight I remember that a peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour of dawn . Only then did any silence come to the wrestling odorous city . There were stars over Vesuvius . The LCI 's in the bay rocked and bubbled like ducks . The lights of the MP 's kiosks and the glow from the pro stations rode in the hot dark like beacons . Then I 'd twist under my mosquito netting.  --  Napoli ? . . . I 've had it ... or it 's having me ...  |p215GiuliaIN  1943 THE ALLIED BOMBERS HIT NAPLES INCESSANTLY . THEYcame in the afternoons with a noise like mad cicadas . But Giuliaand her brother Gennaro rarely took to the shelters . It smelled foul down there . And Giulia and Gennaro had had enough of the stench of families living night after night at lap 's length . They 'd had enough of the screams of women giving birth to their babies in the ricoveri , those screams which could pierce the hum of the plane motors and the crunch of the bombs hitting the streets above their heads . The English bombers made sorties almost daily from noon to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Gennaro would take to the top of their apartment house . In the sunlight on the roof they 'd lean like connoisseurs on the parapet railing and watch the aircraft diving on the port.  --  Se ci uccidono , Giulia said , clutching Gennaro 's cool hand , ci uccidono e basta , no ? They 'd boo fine hits . Often the American planes dropped nothing but leaflets , telling the Neapolitans that the Allies were comingas friends . Giulia and Gennaro had long arrived at the conclusionthat it might n't be such a bad thing to be liberated after all . They knew the score . Their Papa was a ragioniere , endlessly totting up figures in the employ of the state . He told them all the office gossip of the Questura . Hence they knew that fascism , at least in Naples , was as bloated as those balloons sold at the feast of Piedigrotta , which exploded when their rubber saw the sun . After the pamphlet bombings Giulia and Gennaro would gather up handfuls of the leaflets that fell on their roof . These they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dining room table while the old man put on his spectacles and deciphered them . He readp216slowly and avidly under the stained-glass light . So Papa too came to the conclusion that it might n't be such a bad idea for the Allies to take Naples . He did n't tell this to his children , but they read his thoughts . Giulia was nineteen . She had a pale little face under brown ringlets that hung over her forehead like spun sugar . Everything about her was tiny : her mouth , her throat , her breasts , her waist , her ankles . Her expression was always of contented repose , even when she was talking most animatedly with her chum Elvira , whom she 'd chosen as her foil because Elvira was a dowd . Giulia dressed in gay cotton or linen dresses , with a tiny belt about her minute waist , tiny white sport pumps with heels that were almost too high . After every bombing she 'd pick her way with Elvira or Gennarothrough the streets of Naples . She avoided the rubble and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her honeyed skin and made a halo on her small beribboned straw hat . She knew she did n't look much like a Neapolitan girl . Possibly because her mother Rina had been a Florentine before Papa had induced her to settle with him in Naples . But Giulia was politician enough to speak Neapolitan dialect when she was with her chums . She 'd had a better education than most girls of her class . She had almost as much book learning as Gennaro , who was in his second year at the University of Naples . When she was at the liceo , Guilia by some premonition had taken all the English courses she could get . Now she was teaching Gennaro English in the evenings after the dishes were done . From her maestra Giulia had an Oxford accent . She and her brother used to laugh over these lessons , his brown high brow crinkling over the difference between louse lice and spouse spouses . Two years ago Giulia 'd allowed her family to engage her hand for marriage . To a Neapolitan sottotenente with mustaches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoner of war . From his barbed-wire enclosure in Oran he wrote Giulia weekly a twenty-four line letter on green American stationery , with the return address in Italian , German , and Japanese . He told her of his loneliness , of the American Spam he was eating . He hoped that the war would soon end so that she and he could settle down with his family on Via Chiaia , and he could go on with his career as an engineer . In her mind Giulia had already written him off as a liability . She wrote Carissimo fidanzato to him once a week . And like all good Italian girls she led the life of a respectable fidanzata . She visited Pasquale 's family once a month and mourned for him as though he were dead . She passed her time as a ragazzap217per bene , shut up in the house with Mamma or going to the cinema with her brother Gennaro or her chum Elvira , that simpatica dowd . Giulia lived in that vacuum and parenthesis that was Naples from July to October , 1943 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only excitement in Giulia 's life ( she 'd never batted an eyelashat the bombings ) was the periodic concealing of her brother every time the Germans came around to conscript him . In such moments coolness and resourcefulness shone forth all over Giulia . Gennaro would go white under his tan . Mamma would have a heart attack and lie moaning on the tasseled couch , praying that Papa would n't show up from his office , lose his temper with the Tedeschi , and get shot . Gennaro was also in danger of a fucilazione if they ever caught him . Such crises happened every other week . Only Giulia was capable of holding the entire Wehrmacht at bay at the door of their apartment . The Tedeschi respected her as she stood in the doorway , shaking her brown ringlets at them . None ever laid a finger on her , from Gefreiter to Hauptmann . Elvira however licked her chops over frightful stories of Neapolitan girls ( always unidentified ) whose nude bodies were said to have bobbed up in the Bay of Naples or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Giulia 's brother Gennaro was seventeen . She knew she had more influence on him than either Mamma or Papa . She doted on Gennaro . As she watched him comb his black hair over his white linen coat , she often told herself that Gennaro was bello : he was n't dark or greasy like many Neapolitans . She wished he was a little taller , but everything in Gennaro 's body was in fine harmony as he walked with her and Elvira , taking both their arms . Giulia loved him best when he was groaning over his English under the stainedglasslamp at the dinner table , his delicate face puckered into a cold passion , the rich undulations of his hair escaping down almost into his eyes . She noted that he 'd a quick brain , though not so agile as her own . Gennaro kept his body to a whiplike temper by swimming , by fencing with other young Camicie Nere , and by dancing , which he loved dearly . And he was wise enough not to tie himself down by going steady with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Occasionally he 'd disappear with a friend . Giulia knew where they went those evenings . To the casino of Madam Sappho . But then Gennaro was seventeen , and the heart that beat under his short-sleeved shirts and crisp summer jacket was the heart of a Neapolitan , which must make love . Mamma had gained many chili since Papa 'd brought her in 1924 as a bride from Florence . Once she 'd been as slim as Giulia , according to her photos . Now she sat huge and bloated in her dark deep chair , listening to forbidden English radio broadcasts . Her heart was n't good . Mamma was happiest when she heard jazz from London or when she ate a pizza prepared by Giulia to trick her appetite or when her cronies dropped up for coffee  --  a thing that did n't happen too often in these days of constant air-raid sirens . Every evening after supper she lectured her children on the vices of the world and reminisced on their one trip back to Florence to visit her relatives . Mamma hated Naples . She told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave her her allotted hour every evening , sitting at her feet and listening to the hoarse gasping voice coming out of her chins and the mole on her lip . Giulia sat with her small feet tucked up under her buttocks , and Gennaro in the dim apartment smoked a Nazionale and nodded his head dreamily , saying :  --  Eh si , cara mamma ... . And Giulia , in the thousandth repetition of the warning that Naples would be dangerous for a ragazza after the Allies took it ( as they eventually must ) would study Gennaro 's nose in the moonlight and feel a compulsion to tweak it . She wondered if at Madam Sappho 's too the women loved and understood her brother . Every afternoon at fifteen hours Papa banged up the five flights of stairs to the apartment . He came directly from his office in the Questura , where he spent the day playing poker and adding up columns of lire and centesimi . He was always furious and splenetic till he 'd had three cups of scalding caffe espresso . Then his spirits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the rest of the afternoon . His gray mustaches and gray hair and small paunch quivered with apprehension . This apprehension was founded on the insecurity of all employees of the Fascist state . Till now they were doing all right . They were the middle class with comfortable fixed stipends . But after the Allies came ( as they surely would ) the stipend would remain unchanged and the lira would go down down down . Papa could always awake Mamma from her doze by the radio by telling her that as soon as Naples fell , she 'd lose all her avoirdupois because there would n't be anything to eat in the house . He also described with gestures his daughter earning her living on the streets and his son withdrawing from th , . university to work as a truck driver for the Allies , and at a wage that would n't keep him in shoelaces . At this point Mamma would awake with a jump , scream , say her rosary , caress her children , and say that Italiap219was rovinata and they would all be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrors , would merely smile at each other . For they knew they 'd get along somehow , even if the Russianstook over Naples . In his youth Papa had been more progressive and socially minded than most of the employees of the Fascist state , who simply pocketedtheir stipends and their bribes , did as they were told , and played mad politics with the questore at the questura . In 1919 Papa was returning from under arms , sad and confused for the future of Italy . Then he had met Benito Mussolini and had fallen under the spell . Until the Ethiopian War Papa had been a vigorous and intelligent Fascist . Papa knew so well the good and the evil of fascism . Why had n't the combines of Torino and Milano let well enough alone ? Why had n't they built up Campania and Puglie instead of distracting the public 's attention with the Ethiopian War ? Why a dream of empire when Italy had only begun to be unified ? So from 1935 on Papa had been as tepid a Fascist as a ragioniere employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fede nel sognato destino , he said . And with the outbreak of the Second World War Papa in despair ceased to go to Mass on Sundays . In his home he wept and railed against the farabutti who had brought this on Italy . He predicted a speedy end to Europe . He cursed the Italian middle class and the house of Savoy . His curses were in his throatiest Neapolitan . In their hearts his children agreed with him . Mamma wept continually . Her heart condition got worse . On 3 October 1943 , Naples fell to the Fifth Army . For a week Mamma kept her entire family about her in the house . She had a chain of cardiac attacks . The house was without light or gas . The sounds of the liberators in movement that came up from the streets were far more ominous than during the air raids or when the Tedeschi were in Naples . Mamma , with her feet in sheepskin slipperson the divan , was tended by all . She lamented that she 'd ever lived to see this day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all of them . She lambasted Papa for not having consummated his plan of going to America twenty years ago . And every five minutes she made Giulia or Gennaro peer out of the apartment window into the swirling foggy streets to see if there were any New Zealanders coming . She remembered what Il Duce had said the Kiwis would do to all the women of Italy . She had Giulia fetch the carving knife from the cupboard . She promised that this knife would finish in Giulia 's heart if ever a New Zealand tread were heard on their stairs . Then Mamma would turn the knife , smoking from her daughter 's blood , on herself : for who knew that even a matron of her age would be safe from ravishing New Zealand soldiery ? But peer and descry as they could , Giulia and Gennaro saw nothing but truck convoys tearing through the streets below . No New Zealanders came to their apartment to violate them . Over the nightly English lesson Giulia whispered to Gennaro that , while Mamma was keeping them all shut up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up choice jobs with the Allies . A week later Mamma allowed Papa to return to his office in the Questura . She also allowed Giulia and Gennaro to go out and try to buy some food . In their week of immurement they 'd eaten up everything in the house . So Giulia , Gennaro , and Elvira sallied out to buy food . Gennaro carried the carving knife under his armpit , also a little biretta that Papa kept in a secret place . Elvira had also been kept locked up by her family . Her mousy face was unwashed , her hair all mad and atwirl . Giulia in her neat frock and little cloth coat with the fur collar thought privately that her chum looked a fright . When a girl is n't by nature attractive , she becomes a monster when she lets herself go . In early October , 1943 , Naples was a city of chaos , of movement with no purpose , of charnel smells , of rain , of army truck headlights coming out of the mist like eyes without lids . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans had taken over bombing the town as soon as they 'd vacated the premises in favor of the Fifth Army . After the sun set through the fall rains , the few who dared go abroad stumbled their way over sidewalks in a close dreadful blackness . There was n't a light , except from the truck convoys . Corpses were let lie where they fell , creasing and bloating from the rain . Living Neapolitans stripped the clothing from them : the living needed the cloth . The city 's sewage had all backed up in a spasm of vomiting , like stomachs nauseated with war . What stench did n't renege from the bay wafted through the ruptured mains in the streets . There were red whispers of typhus , and prayers that it was true that the Americans had a new disinfectant . And in the daytime the poor sun squeaking through the rains showed a spectacle more ghoulish than you imagined by darkness . Clots of returning Neapolitans trekked in from their hiding places outside the city . Household furniture was pushed through the streets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks were trying to pass . Horses and van owners werep221clubbed and kicked and screamed at by American MP 's . They writhed and wrestled with the traffic like Laocoons in a haze.  --  La nostra citta e morta , Gennaro said , his voice sickened and phlegmy.  --  Non credo , Giulia said , but she too was ashgreen with terror as they felt their way through the vichi , where rubbish and foul moisture trembled on the walls like rotten emeralds . Then she noticed that Elvira was chewing gum . Giulia whirled on her friend and demanded to know , her eyes narrowing into sparks , where that American gum came from . Elvira began to splutter and said that an American soldier had given it to her brother yesterday.  --  Ebbene ? Giulia said savagely , elbowing her bosom friend against an archway.  --  No , no , no , no , Elvira said , bursting into tears . Non ci pensare . ... Giulia felt relieved , even though she despised herself for the thought that had popped into her head . . . . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elvira , but not of that kind which would send her amica out onto the sidewalks to proposition the Allied soldiers . By a series of leaps across streets , slinking along the narrowest and remotest alleys , they were approaching the Questura . They arrived at a church slit in two by bombs . There remained the blasted portico with its picture of the Madonna under shattered glass , its candelabra twisted like a frostbitten branch . Under the tempera of the walls lay a cadaver in overalls . Its dead eyes turned upward and outward like buttons fearful of a buttonhook . A little way off , on another pile of slag , was the hat that the head had worn when alive . Elvira let out one cluck and fainted . Gennaro laid his head against the shattered wall and vomited soundlessly . Giulia desired to hold his head , but instead she knelt down by Elvira and chafed her hands . After a time of murmuring incantationsand encouragements , the way her mother had when they were babies , Giulia got her party restored and walking on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wipe the corners of his mouth , from which dribbled a thread of slime.  --  Vergogna , Giulia scolded . She heard her small clear voice like a flute over the tympanum of sound that was Naples that morning . The pallor sank under Gennaro 's olive skin , he resumed his spry gentle gait . Elvira pulled her shapeless hat over her eyes and marched on in a blind stupor like a pig to the slaughter . At the main entrance to the Questura , where her father worked , Giulia and her party came upon a long queue of screaming and buzzing Neapolitans , talking with hands and throats . At the side door cordons of MP 's were hustling others under arrest to cells . The American MP 's girdled the creamy stone walls of the entire Questura building . In the glassed vestibule hung the sign : QUI GLI ALLEATI IMPIEGANO CIVILI COMPETENTI AL LAVOROSo Giulia told her brother and her friend to take heart ; there were good jobs waiting for them inside with the Americans . She stood on Via Medina on the outskirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the yowling of the Neapolitans and the shouted orders of the MP 's drove everything out of her head . She felt again that long-ago sensation when , as a tiny girl with sparkling ringlets , she 'd take refuge in her mother 's skirts if strangers spoke to her . But then she looked at her brother 's sad proud face , at Elvira , who was beginning to jitter again . So she pulled her furpiece about her , took both their arms , and prepared herself to rush the line in the best Neapolitan tradition on trolleys.  --  Where 's this pretty baby goin so fast , huh ? An American MP blocked her path . His sudden appearance , almostout of the ground , stopped them dead in their tracks . It was the first American soldier the three had seen at close range . Elviraburst into silly sobbing . Gennaro came to attention and gave the Fascist salute . Giulia stood her ground and simply looked at the MP . She was as tall as to his chest . Under his helmet she saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adolescence . His eyes were like oranges in blood . His mouth was a line of purple . He was in a tight olive-drab uniform and leggins . Over one shoulder and by his waist hung a burnished leather holster and a pistol . The blue and white MP brassard on his arm was pinned below the single chevron . He looked at her and she returned his glare until his eyes softened and netted into wrinkles . All her English flew out of her brain , then seeped back in . And Giulia spoke with her Oxford accent :  --  Please , sir , please .. .  --  Ah , molto buono , said the MP , to parlare americano ?  --  I know English discreetly well , Giulia said . And sir , we three desire a post with the liberating army . . . . We are good decentp223Italians . . . . My father is not an active Fascist . . . . We will do anything that good people ought to do to live .. .  --  A sharp mouse , a sharp mouse , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He put out his gauntleted hand and with a finger lighter than she 'd have imagined stroked the soft line below her ear to her chin . Giulia 's impulse was to step smartly back out of his reach , but she stayed herself . Back of her she heard Gennaro 's breath go into a snort . She hoped her brother would control himself.  --  Please sir , Giulia said , I am an honest young Italian girl . This is my husband behind me .... We are recently married .. .  --  O scusate , the American MP said , himself stepping back . I did n't know ya was married . . . . Well , baby , come around in a few more days and ask for Gibson . I might be able to help ya . But do n't walk in that door now unless ya fixin to take a blood test an maybe end up in Poggioreale jail . . . . But if ya wanta come back in a day or so , there might be somethin cookin . . . . Frankly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ya the first Ginso girl I could imagine myself goin for . . . . Why do n't ya come to America ? Ya smart enough to do all right for yaself.  --  Thank you , sir , Giulia said . She gathered her brood and hustled them around the corner of the Questura to Via Diaz . Yet once again she looked back at the MP . He was still standing with his hands on his Sam Browne belt and gazing after her.  --  An stay off these streets , baby , he yelled at her . Giulia did n't tell her brother or her friend , but she liked the American MP for all his seamy looks . He had a brusqueness and a crudity that would n't be acceptable in an Italian man . But Giulia also knew from some core of insight that he would be incapable of doing her any treachery . They walked up Via Diaz . Gennaro was lost within himself , murmuring something about the soldiering in the Italian Army and the fine manners of their ex-carabinieri . Elvira was sunk in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tortoise into her coat and was trusting only to Giulia 's arm to guide her . From the rear of the Questura , where the cells were under the ground floor , they heard the screaming of incarcerated ladies calling out Neapolitanobscenities and protesting that they 'd never heard of syphilis . On the facade of the neo-something Provincia Building Giulia saw another advertisement for Italian help . At this portal were gathered petitioners of a different feather . She asked one of the hangers-on whose offices were here and was told that Allied MilitaryGovernment was setting up its control of Naples . In the tense postulant faces Giulia saw most of the South Italian nobility . Contesse had risen early from their beds to get themselves a job as social secretary to a colonel ; marchesi were ready to put their Ischia or Capri villas at the disposal of the Americans and the British . All the elite of Campania were waiting here to prove that they 'd never been Fascist , but had been just biding their time till they could give cocktail parties for the Allies.  --  Razza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Giulia led him and Elvira away . She saw that there was no hope from AMGOT . She could n't compete with really big operators  --  yet . In a market of Naples where she 'd always traded Giulia found reality of a closer sort . There was almost no food on the shelves and no meat in the windows except a few chines of red runny flesh looking like no beef or pork she 'd ever seen before . And what little there was of anything was selling for from four to ten times its price of two weeks ago . Giulia felt herself going sick and frightened under her gay dress and trim coat . She heard her voice shake on the brink of a sob as she asked Mr. Gargiulo if this were n't just a temporary shortage , if the Allies would n't soon be rushing food into Naples . Thereupon Mr. Gargiulo , who 'd always been so kind to her , seemed to blow up under his bloody apron . He delivered himself of five minutes ' blistering Neapolitan rhetoric , of pleading and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a cretin , then apologized to her ; he called Elvira a ninny from Calabria , and he asked Gennaro in a burst of irony what good all that fine Latin and Greek were going to do him now . Then before Giulia 's eyes , which were beginning to seep the tears she 'd been suppressing all morning , Mr. Gargiulo waved a freshly printed one-lira note . He told them that this was the new currency of the Allies , and that it was n't worth enough to buy a chicken with , no , not a whole bale of it . He told them that from now on Napoli was liberated  --  liberated from life itself , because henceforth money would mean nothing in the markets , nothing . He told them that the Allies had also liberated the lira of any value . So all four of them cried there in the butcher shop with the rainy October air looking in on them . Then Mr. Gargiulo threw into Giulia 's shopping basket some suspicious pasta , a few old greens , and a chunk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her moneyp225because it was the last time they 'd see one another alive . They wept some more and cursed . Only Giulia stood a little apart from her own anguish and thought and puzzled inside her small studious head . When they got home and told Mamma what Naples was like , she had a really good heart attack . For a week it was thought that Manama would n't live . From that time on Giulia. and her family entered a desert of hopelessness . Since they 'd kept alive all during the German occupationof Naples and the bombings , they looked back on those days as a rather gay paradise compared to their existence now after the city 's fall . Then they had n't minded living from day to day . But now it was a minute to minute struggle , in which any problem five minutes hence seemed a lifetime removed . Every evening they had bleak sessions under the stained-glass lamp on the dining room table . They admitted that they had n't been liberated from anything at all , that the war was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survives pneumonia only to discover that his heart has been weakened forever . Worst of all she found that misery does n't necessarily make strange bedfellows  --  or any bedfellows at all . Those other ladies in the apartment to whom Mamma , when they were ill , lent coffee and fruit and fresh meat now withdrew into chilly hostility when they discovered that the bounty was ended . Hence Giulia began to doubt whether privation and suffering unite people so much as they divide them . Each family went into a sniping war against all others . Everyone in Naples agreed only in saying that the Allies were worse liars than the Fascists . Everyone was divided from everyone else . Whereas the Neapolitans had known a certain dreary camaraderie when they all faced the war together in the bomb shelters , they now became one another 's enemies , since each must go out and forage for food . And Giulia watched the comedy of her father 's weekly stipend . Each week he collected the same sum of lire that he 'd been receiving for ten years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bread . It was like a child putting up his hands to stop a tidal wave . The first weeks they managed only with the thought that this state of affairs could n't last . For Papa was known and loved in Naples . He worked every angle and every connection , pulled every wire so that his family could buy in secret shops . His only luxury was that he smoked much . For a while his cherished cigarettes continued to dribble in : three from the Vomero , two from Torregaveta , four from Caserta.  | In the third week typhus burst out all over Naples the way a rash seeps through after presages of itching . Mamma said sta bene , it would carry her off quickly , then she would n't have to bother about her heart any longer , and there 'd be one less mouth to feed . She rose from her sofa more than she should and spent time in the kitchen beside Giulia , trying to cook something into or out of the gray heavy pasta and the vegetables that seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white bread the Allies had promisedin their propaganda leaflets . Then began the foul rectification of a foul situation . Everyone knew that you could buy in Naples any amount of American meat and medical supplies . If you had the price . Papa knew where these things were sold , for most of his friends had gone into the black market . The only catch was that the prices were ten to twenty times the normal level . Two weeks after its fall there was anything you wanted to buy in Naples . For two thousand lire a day a small family could live quite well . But Giulia knew no small Neapolitan families with an income of two thousand lire a day . She did n't know any millionaires . One evening after a supper of dark bread , beans , and a potato soup Papa announced that they might as well bid farewell to honesty . He said that only two classes were destined to survive in Naples  --  the very rich and the very poor . The rich could afford to live through the parenthesis by selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the poor stole more than they ever had because with the Allies here there was more to steal . Papa 's mustacheswere as stiff as iron . He described himself as a man tied to a plank and ordered to stand on his feet . Giulia listened . She wished she had more of the Italian woman 's gift of tears . In her throat she felt only a pain as though there were a hot tauter there . After a while she went into the gabinetto . Her stomach would n't keep down what she 'd just eaten for it was as delicious as grass and as palatable as cardboard . She stood over the bowl holding her hot dry forehead and feeling her stomach twitch oysterlike and deathly . Then she put on her coat and went out to find Elvira for a walk . Elvira 's family had already entered the bracket of the war rich . Papa Brazzi had closed his barbershop and had taken a position as head waiter in an American officers ' mess . From the kitchen door of this installation there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee , sugar , and white bread . Enough of this contraband appeared on Papa Brazzi 's table to keep his family as well nourished as they 'd always been . The rest he sold or bartered.  |p227Actually  Elvira and her family were living on a slightly higher level than the prewar one for their class , but in comparison to most other Neapolitans in October , 1943 , they were princes . Elvira'sposture was better , her eyes prouder , her complexion almost radiant . She was now in a position to make a brilliant marriage , if she chose . Elvira greeted Giulia with condescension . She led her friend into the Brazzi kitchen , remarking happily that poor Giulia looked pale and faint . She set before Giulia a plate of American spiced meat out of a can , two slices of white bread , and a cup of chocolate which she bragged came from American powder . Giulia ate every morsel , trying to conceal how hungry she was.  --  Ah , poveretta , Elvira squealed , watching Giulia as though she were a canary breakfasting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her vomiting , knew coolly that this was the moment Elvira 'd been waiting for all her suppresseddays  --  the chance to play the queen at her own expense . Giulia tried not to listen to Elvira 's itemized boasting over Papa Brazzi 's commerce in the borsa nera , of the goods that lay in the Brazzi cellar . Arm in arm she and her new patroness walked in the Galleria Umberto . The arcade was moist and dark after the rains . On the pavement still lay the splinters of glass that had been bombed out of the skylight . A few bars were open . There was no electricity in Naples , but lighted candles stood in their own wax on the marble bar tops . By this wan light Allied soldiers drank vermouth . And Giulia noticed that they were being whistled at in a casual savagerythat made a pain press on her eyeballs . It was the first time in her life she 'd been treated so . She tightened her grasp on Elvira'sarm and forced her into a swifter pace toward the Via Verdi end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the midst of the murk and the candlelight and the slippery pavement those walks she 'd taken here as a little girl with her Mamma and Papa on Sunday afternoons . There was glass then in the dome of the Galleria Umberto ; the sun dropped like a gay flag , the murmur of the Neapolitans talking was bright and sure . In those days Giulia wore small green coats and green ankle socks and a small straw hat fastened to her chin with a green ribbon . In those same bars where the Allied soldiers were now drinking , she used to reach up her little hand for the Sunday ice-cream cone . She was picked up and kissed by all , though Mamma did n't like compliments paid in her presence.  | Fifteen years ago ! Out of the haze and the feeling of sleepwalking in a dank cellar , Giulia heard those voices praising her baby beauty :  --  Ah , la piccina ! Eh , the piccola regina ! Gom'e carina , signora , e ben educata pure . But this memory broke off and mangled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Elvira were walking through a changed Galleria . She observed  --  at first she thought it her imagination  --  that Elvira was gawking at the Allied soldiers , obviously turning her head as they passed concentrations of them chewing gum or passing around a cognac bottle . Giulia queried softly , Was it Elvira 's plan to marry an American ? Elvira replied with a coy casting down of her eyes , Well , she 'd considered the matter . Then Giulia said with the tinkle of an icicle that the Americans were different from us and might easily break the hearts of us Italian girls . And Elvira gave a too loud laugh and stated that sentimentalitywas out of date ; it did n't pay.  --  Ah , ti prego , said Giulia , di non dirmi pin simili sciocchezze . To which Elvira replied with heavy scorn that it was all very well for Giulia to talk big ideals when she had n't enough to eat . For the first time in her tranquil life Giulia had the impulse to slap someone . But she merely tightened her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Galleria Giulia saw a sight that was new . It scored her with the fascination of a pimple on the back of one 's neck . She saw many girls alone and in pairs , girls she 'd never noticed on the streets of Naples before . Their attire , even in the dark , shone with a determined if shabby brilliance . They laughed constantly in a sound like crows jeering . They urged themselves boldly on the soldiers , who waited or pulled on their bottles . Through the night air tumbled estimates in lire such as one would hear on the stock exchange in Piazza della Borsa . Giulia 'd never heard Italian women talking money so much before . The price of four thousand lire was much bandied between the soldiers and the girls . Then Elvira nudged her . An American soldier was leaning against the slate-hued wall of the Galleria . He wore a fur-collared jacket and muddy leggins . In his hands were two tin cans which he pushed and retracted from the girl in front of him , who put out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her dress was ragged . She was in a hysteria of several moods . She seemed hungry and frightened and lewd all at once . Finally she seized the soldier 's arm , pulled him along with a searing laugh , and they both ran out of the Galleria . Elvira tittered andp229revealed that in those tin cans was the food served to American troops at the front . Her Papa called it C-ration . Giulia put two and two together . She began to quiver , standing still in the Galleria . Lightning raked across her eyes . There stormed up in her small breast a bitterness and a fury that frightened her and tore at her . She thought her heart was going to stop , that she was going blind with rage . And she heard her voice clang over her rigid lips like knives . She cried , not to Elvira or to anyone in particular , that a soldier who gave food to a hungry girl for love was outside the human race . Elvira tittered some more , said that this was war , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose . But then she stopped , for she saw that Giulia was crying . Tears plopped down Giulia 's cheeks . Sobs came from her small body in a series of waves , dry waves like sheaves of paper ripped by a mad hand.  --  Siamo vinti . . . . In questa guerra sono morti non soltanto i soldati . . . ma 1'anima , le donne , e Vonore di tutti quanti . . . . Che Iddio ci aiuti ... . Still sobbing , she forced Elvira to quit the Galleria with her . She knew that if Elvira so much as giggled once more , she 'd hurl her onto the wet sidewalk , though she was smaller than Elvira . Elvira suddenly took her leave and went into her own house . Giulia passed a church which the sacristan was just locking for the night . She told the sacristan that it was a gracious idea to lock Christ in and the people out of the churches when the sun set . The sacristan shrugged and stepped aside to let her pass in . Giulia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cross on her forehead . She was glad that Elvira had gone on home . She was still trembling , as a leaf remembers the wind . After the black rainy air of Naples the church was glowing with vigil lights . These streaked out the offerings in the glass showcases , the cups of gold , the jewels , the token offerings for miraculous cures . Because of these treasures the church was locked at sundown . At a side altar a plump old priest was saying his rosary . Because she made some noise in entering , he looked at her testily and clucked . Giulia knelt before the statue of the Madonna , which every year was borne through the streets on August 15 covered with flowers and smoked over with torches and incense . And Giulia prayed to Our Lady . She 'd never really prayed before in her life . She told Holy Mary Mother of God that she was a Neapolitan girl of nineteen . That she had her selfishnesses . That perhaps she was a little too proud for her station in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) what are women put into this world for ? Are n't they to make good wives to men . . . at least in Italy . . . . Every good Italian girl wishes to be a wife and mother . . . . A woman does n't fear suffering as much as a man does . . . . Having children is n't pleasant ... but at least it 's natural .... Mother of God , a woman ca n't cope with unnatural things like war , because a woman was put here to bring life into this world . . . women are n't interested in killing .. Giulia asked the Madonna to help her . Her lips formed most pas ' sionately around that word , help . Then she left the church . It was only two minutes now to the door of the apartment . She rounded an alley and came upon a tableau . An American soldier was lying unconscious on a doorstep . In her reflex of flinching back Giulia saw that this drunk was being relieved of his lire and his packs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from bending over the unconscious figure . It was Giulia 's brother Gennaro , all pale and with a murderous grief in his eyes . Her brother Gennaro . Giulia discovered the consequences of sharing a secret which must never again be referred to , even with its imparter . This weight forced her deeper into herself and removed her completely from this life . Hitherto her adjustment to living had been a sweet moderation : neither mad for society nor shunning it . She 'd lived well in herself , but not with that intensity or misanthropy which marks .. he queer or the gifted . Now all was changed . The sight of her brother bending over the drunken American soldier and rifling his pockets had burnt Giulia 's eyes , as though she 'd looked straight at the sun . Often at night she saw this vision , asleep or awake , as a light remains on our retina after we turn away into the dark . With this there came to her moral and ethical nature a rift which refused to heal , which caused her night after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gennaro had done what she saw him doing not through meanness or tendency to burglary in himself . He 'd done what he 'd done not for himself but because his family had to eat and because he could sell a pack of American cigarettes for three hundred lire . He had only to steal a few packs a week , and his familywould revert to their former tranquil prosperity . All this Giulia knew , but the explanation did n't help any . And she knew too that in these times Neapolitans of the middle class could starve slowly ,  |p231as  effectively as if they 'd willfully gone on a hunger strike . No , it was n't that Gennaro had stolen that brought agony to Giulia 's soul ; it was that he had had to steal , that there was no way out of doing what he 'd done . Thus the worshiped figure of her brother became a symbol of that scabrous destiny which was debasing them all . He was no more her Gennaro , but a marionete whipped on by a fury and a fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filthy . He was now much more and much less her brother . He 'd become the projection of all that was diseased in Naples of 1943 . To her dying day Giulia could never forget that figure crouched in the murky vico , that look of horror and fascination outstarting from her brother 's eyes , that brown hand she 'd so often spanked in their English lessons going like a shuttle through the pockets of the American soldier . Both their hearts broke at that instant  --  Gennaro'sand Giulia 's . They 'd understood one another perfectly from the days when the little sister used to take the baby brother 's hand . There could never again be between them that ripeness and gentleness , never , never . It was as though in a moment of madness they 'd committed incest together , and had arisen defiled from the act , resolving never to see one another again . For their love had been close . They 'd collided and passed through and beyond one another , like shadows embracing in hell . Mamma , noting that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abundance and variety , nodded sagely from her couch . She said , See , they 'd done wrong to curse the Allies , for they 'd kept their promises . Italians were overhasty in praise and in blame . She praised the American Spam and found that American coffee did her angina good . She hoped Gennaro 'd make the acquaintance of an American and bring him home for dinner . In this way they might repay some of their debt to the Allies for liberating Naples and bringing fine American rations into the house . Giulia , when these things were said at table , would feel a knife go through her brain . She 'd excuse herself from the meal and go to her room , for she knew that remaining at table would mean screaming . Her brother , the sad bent tool of injustice , simply sat in his place and stared at his plate . His dark hair seemed to have turned into sleek snakes hissing along his forehead . Gennaro 's own sorrow forced him into a kind of flagrance of bitterness , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his room he kept cartons of American cigarettes . These Giulia would find as she did her morning dusting while Mamma chattered from the couch in the parlor . Then Giulia , in an ecstasy of horrid fascination , would pick up the shining cellophane packages with the red target in the center . She 'd count them with loathing , letting each fall back into the drawer through her fingers . Each morning she would play with these American cigarettes till she had to sit on Gennaro 's bed and weep . Mamma in the salottino would get peevish and restless and call out that Giulia was getting lazy in her housekeeping , and would make no man a good wife . Giulia knew that Papa , anything but stupid , guessed what his son was up to after a few days ' lying . So , living off the American food and the American cigarettes which he so passionately loved , Papa 's mustache grew white . Giulia watched a metaphysical corset twine round Papa 's plump chest that was strangling off his breath . One evening in November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All evening long he 'd been ostensibly in high spirits , jesting of his Fascist youth , of Mussolini 's violin playing , of Edda Ciano 's legs . He was as gay as one coming out of an anesthetic . But Giulia , inured to agony , saw his mirth for what it was , the abandon of a clown with a dying son . At her door Giulia 's father kissed her good night so hard that she tasted the small onions he 'd eaten with such bravura , the tart red wine he 'd drunk with dinner , the stinging afterbreath of American cigarettes . And Papa 's chest shook as he drew her head over his heart.  --  Ah , cara mia , the bellezza ! Abbiamo un figlio ed un fratello ladro ... . And as she lay in her bed she sounded the depths of her father 's bitterness . Or sometimes Giulia tried to exchange a few words with Gennaro , those teasing sisterly sallies she 'd always made . But their hollowness was obvious to her and , she knew , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to both as a house hit by an incendiary bomb : only walls stood in the void where once were lovely rooms . In December , 1943 , Giulia sat under the stained-glass lamp over the dining room table . She was reading Risorgimento , which she had n't had time to glance over all day . It was full of news of the countless Neapolitan political parties and their diatribes against one another . Giulia thought of the line of steel and death to the north of her . The Germans were making Italy a shambles by retreating slowly to the north , destroying as they went . She wondered what other girls of nineteen were thinking tonight in Rome , in Firenze , in Milano . Then her eye hit upon an ad . It said thatp233shortly a club for American officers would open in the Bank of Naples . They were going to hire Neapolitan ladies and gentlemenas cashiers and waiters . Giulia arose from her chair , smoothing her somber dress and her hair . She was wearing also her cloth coat with the fur collar because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you buy wood or coal , even on the mercato nero . Giulia considered again . Then she went to her brother 's room . She knew how she 'd find him . And he was . Bent over their old English grammar . He lurched to his feet as she switched on the ceiling light . His passionate vitality at once wove an armor about him . She felt it opaque and dense as a wall , but she kept walking till she stood beside him and took his hand . She put her index finger on the advertisement and pushed it to him to read as though she were forcing an invalid to eat . For a minute they stood there looking at one another with a fierceness that gathered and stiffened them both . Because it was the first time she 'd brought herself to look upon Gennaro in months , Giulia saw how beautiful was his face , like the face of one with a wasting disease , where all the life and reserve passion pounds into the cheeks and sits there in a wildness of decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For a second she thought she was going to die . But some cyclone blew them into one another 's arms , where they wept loudly for some while . In the cold brightness of Naples in December Giulia and Gennaro and Elvira walked through the Galleria Umberto . It was nine o'clock in the morning . The night had brought the usual air raid . There were American ambulances in the streets , and Neapolitan plumed hearses were carrying those who 'd died earlier . The winter of Naples has its own peculiar sting like the cursing in Neapolitan dialect . Giulia shivered and drew her fur about her neck . Since she had to wear it in the house too to keep warm , it mocked her out of doors . But she was soon distracted from her own discomfort by seeing the scat of Gennaro 's trousers . He was wearing a gray pencilstripedbusiness suit . A year ago it had been a quiet vessel for his beauty . Now the seat was shiny and the elbows the same . For herself and her brother , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich . Elvira was getting a double chin from eating so opulently . She did her nails in various colors and painted her face till it was a mixed vegetable plate . She 'd developed a mince in her walk that once was clumsy and nervous . Into her conversation , which had always been dreary , full of hot flashes and tremors and palpitations , Elvira now injected American words of whose meaning she was n't precisely sure . Gennaro , who in his dealingsknew a practical and earthy English , would correct her hastily and beg her not to use such expressions . Then Elvira would titter furiously and say , My stars , she was getting as wicked as Countess Ciano , was n't she ? Elvira wanted to see society , especially American . She 'd developed a thirst for night life . And no matter how rich Papa Brazzi got from the black market , he 'd still lock Elvira in every night at curfew time unless she got a respectable job . Elvira was attempting to get this job to get away from her family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bank of Naples , she hoped to snare herself a handsome American officer . All this Giulia guessed . Neapolitans said that the gray modern slate-colored Bank of Naples had escaped bombing because North Italian bankers had bought off the pilots of American and British bombers . It was the only clean and solid building on Via Roma . Its whole front was bricked and buttressed off from the street , against having its brass and glass doors shattered from detonations . The rear entrance was through a crypt with a subterranean car park . Inside this cave were many Neapolitans , wearing a suitable manner to be hired as waitress or cashier . They were all murmuring to one another , but they became demure and formal when they expected the officer in charge of the club to appear at the head of the stairs . Would they be fed three times a day by the Americans ? What were the wages ? The Americans could afford anything . They ought to get together like a trade union and force the Americans to accede to their demands . Giulia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roma . The males were nearly all Neapolitans with spectacles and greased hair and a classic air of exasperation as though they 'd been whipped by their families out of the library of the University of Naples in the middle of their doctor 's dissertation . Gennaro and Giulia and Elvira took their place in the queue and waited in silent listening . A queue is an unnatural formation for Neapolitans , who like to swarm and catch as catch can . Late , very late , perhaps to show the Neapolitans that they were a conquered people and not patients at a charity dispensary , a glass door opened in the wall of gray granite . The hundreds of petitioners fell into reverent silence and arranged their clothes and hair . There appeared two American officers in short monkey jackets of green cloth . Their breasts were barred with colored ribbons . There was a major built like a duck , his beard like gravelp235along the jowls resting on his collar . A cheery stomach butted the high waist of his jacket . With him was a sad young lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nose . To Giulia he seemed an unhappy grandmother commissioned by mistake in the United States Army . Beside these two an interpreter looking like an osprey took up his position . The major made a pass in the air past his paunch with his jeweled hand . There sounded in the half-cellar a voice as rich and persuasive as a pii bursting with suet . The major stopped after every sentence , which the interpreter then translated to the crowd . Giulia had never heard anything quite like the English that the major used . She listened only to him , paying no attention to the sentence by sentence rendition of the interpreter :  --  Mah deah Neahpolitan friends . . . for you ah mah friends , each an every one of yo . . . . We ah openin' this here little club to give ouah pooah American officers a place to relax in . . . . But this heah club is also a friendly gesture to you , ouah Neapolitan friends . . . .

We do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my deah friends , just form an orderly line and wait yoah turn for interview . Half of the Neapolitans broke away from the mass and went out of the rear of the Bank of Naples . Under their breaths they mewed and spat and cursed . Those who 'd decided to stay pushed up the little stairway past the custode and turned left along the cool dark walls , cloudy with the veins and strata of the stone . Then they milled through another corridor where the doors were tall and bronzy . Then they mounted a stairway with sweep and curve where once Fascist bankers climbed with their briefcases . On the second floor more brass doors gave into a room where a faun played over a lighted fountain . Then came the vastest room Giulia 'd ever seen outside of the movies , and lastly a narrower apartment where benches had been linked on a trestle to make a long bar . The windows were all arched and hung with valances of cream and green . This led through a small reception room with a pink piano to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were oddly silent for Neapolitans as they sat down in the deep green leather divans and looked at one another with that mutual suspicion of outer offices . Giulia and Gennaro and Elvira found a seat close to the office door on a long sofa , in which they seemed to drop into a well of cushions . Then a girl ran in with a shriek and collapsed beside them . She was pursued by a brilliant-eyed man in the belted jacket and the loud trousers of Italian racing drivers . They introduced themselves as Wilma and Gino . Giulia measured Wilma with interest and sympathy . Wilma was n't young any more , but she balanced the equation by a mockery of everything , herself included . She began at once talking to Giulia . She told Giulia that Gino was n't so rich as lovers she 'd had in Trieste and Tripoli , but that he was shrewder . Wilma chain-smoked , thieving cigarette after cigarette from Gino 's waistcoat and stabbing at her lipsticked charred butts with violet fingernails . Her laughter was low and one inch this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saying that Wilma was a vecchia strega , how he 'd been an interpreter for the Americans since Salerno , how they were really quite nice to work for ; and when they saw that you did a little feathering of your own nest , they took it all in the spirit of business competition . In the affection between Wilma and Gino Giulia noticed something as bitter and close as mint under grass . Wilma kept grabbing Giulia 's hands and caressing them as she reminisced of high life in Trieste and Tripoli . Gino got into a conversation with Gennaro on fencing and swimming and calcio . In track , alas , Gino had hardened his arteries before his time . Wilma 's mouth , except when she laughed , was a long generous sphincter of carmine . During all this badinage Elvira just sat leaningher chins on her bosom and gasping with delight that she was at last getting a taste of high society . But Wilma , whatever she was or had been , was a wise woman . Love and tricks and shrewdnessand irony dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burble platitudes . She told Giulia that no woman need ever condescend in this life ; no , not even if she worked in a casino . Giulia never forgot what Wilma told her that morning.  |p237The  Officers ' Club of the Peninsular Base Section opened on an afternoon in late December , 1943 . The light of winter Naples crossed Via Roma , cut the standards on the balconies , and grazed the parquet of the dance floor . Wilma and Elvira sat behind high enclosed cash desks and sold books of chits for drinks . Giulia 's post was a small throne behind a long directorial table with a silver salver of Spamwiches and chocolate eclairs . For seven hours it was her function and her duty to lift up these refreshments on a silver spatula and put them into the wax paper in the hand of the purchaser . She could look across the dance floor and watch Wilma at her cash desk . Wilma 's pose was to lean Sapphically on her hand and lazily to accept cigarettes from officers . The major had ordered all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hue of discolored wallpaper . He did this , he said , because he knew the desires of men in wartime . His aim was to make his girls as mouselike as possible . At first Wilma and Giulia raged because the faded Mother Hubbards made them look like graduates of the Pompei orphanage . But Giulia soon found out that at closing time at the bar it would have made no difference if she 'd been wearing a washed-out pea pod . The officers came around anyway . Of all the major 's employees only Elvira was sad . She moped and mulled behind her cash desk . Nobody came to her to buy chits . So at the end of two weeks the major fired her , advising her to go up to the Anzio beachhead , where it was darker and the men were less fussy about what they looked at . Elvira returned to her family , to be locked up every night at curfew time . She said she 'd hated the whole vulgar job from the start , and had only been talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men than women worked at PBS Club . The major said that Giulia and Wilma were simply the dash of sugar in the staff . There was a corps of waiters , tricked out in white ties and tails . Two bars functioned simultaneously , for the major roared out that what American officers wanted for relaxation was a combination of Radio City Music Hall , Minsky 's , Jack Dempsey 's , and the Silver Dollar . What he meant by this Giulia never learned . And the major , his sleeves rolled up , personally schooled the Neapolitan bartenders till he said they could get a job anywhere in New York . They were Enrico , always melancholy and almost sweetly pock-marked ; and Demetrio , that acute little rat who could n't stop having children ; and Luigi , who rolled his eyes on either side of his huge nose and bragged of his friendships with German officers and sang " Firenze Stanotte " ; and handsome Sergio , who 'd somehow got trapped in Naples from Torino and never talked to anybody , but kept a diary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own nostalgia . Then there were the waiters who shot across the polished floor with their coattails clanging like gossips ' tongues , banging their trays on the bar and calling for Eight Jeeen e J000s over the orchestra . Of these there was first of all Giulia 's brother Gennaro , who kept himself aloof from the rest . She never discovered where he got his tails . Gennaro had taken to brilliantining his hair , which glistened like phosphorus . He now spoke perfect American , bragged much with the American officers , called his sister keed or mouse or butch . Giulia watched the American nurses gasping for Gennaro . And there was Furio , the tiny Communist who was once a tenente di vascello in the Regia Marina and spent his Fridays off at party meetings in the Vomero . And there was Alfredo and his mustaches , who 'd made what he hoped was his pile in a Brooklyn barbershop and had come back to Naples to die in peace . But a bomb had got the house and the family for which Alfredo 'd slaved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times for a tip of cigarettes . His bows to majors and colonels made his chin almost touch the floor and his coattails lash up his spine . There was also a troop of Neapolitan ladies and gentlemen who did odd jobs about PBS Officers ' Club . They did n't belong to the white-collar crowd . Giulia soon got bored with seven hours ' sitting behind her sandwiches and looking like a madonna , as the major had instructed her to do . So she watched everything . She observed Gaetano the electrician climb ladders in his sandals and replace burnt-out bulbs in the chandeliers . From her table she might also observe the sales talks and outraged nobility of Signora Anna Negri , who stood beside her showcase on her aching feet and sold miniaaures of Capri or cameos especially tailored to the mothers of Americans . The major 's retinue reported to work at 1630 hours each afternoon . They trailed chilled and peeved up the sharp noble stairs to the second floor of the Banco di Napoli , each carrying his or her supper : mozzarella and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night 's newspaper . Giulia used to listen to them talk as she held her own black market supper tight against her small sharp breasts and marched up the staircase . How they talked ! They could n't live on the ninety lire a day the major was paying , nor on the leftover smelly old cheese sandwiches , nor on the old choco/late eclairs which they were allowed to carry out of the club when the cream became like pus . As Giulia mounted that staircase every afternoon , all of Naples in the winter of 1943-44 was around her ears : babies freezing because there was n't any firewood , Americanissuepasta that turned to gray entrails when you put it in the pot , the sugar at wild prices , whose office boss ( God love him ! ) was buried alive in last night 's bombing , what girl had finally given up her reputation and gone with the Allies , the rate of Negro children born to Sicilian women . Giulia knew only that she was numb from it all . Then she would put on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tittattoe with an American captain till her eyes sang with pain , or listen to an American colonel who resembled her Papa tell her why he had n't won the mayoralty of Sioux Falls , wherever that was . Both Giulia and Wilma had their own following . Around her cash desk Wilma attracted young airplane drivers whose tongues began to drip after their eighth Martini . For Wilma 's benefit they fought all over again the bombing sorties out of Foggia . They gestured and goaded one another into new heights of theatrical enterprise in their tales , as little boys vie to entertain a little girl on the sidewalk . And Wilma also had a patronage that intrigued Giulia . These were bright and disillusioned parachute captains , majors from rich Baltimore families , lieutenants who wrote verses . With all these characters Wilma held court . She was magnificent , Giulia thought . Wilma knew what was in God 's mind when He created Woman . When Wilma entertained her boys at her cash desk , she leaned slightly back from them in tender hauteur , her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilma 's mouth was too big , but it was in such constant motion of eloquence that Giulia was never sure how large it was . And sometimesWilma 's laugh of protest came through the dance band , a trumpet all her own . Giulia saw that Wilma loved men . Therefore men loved Wilma . Or when no men were clustered about Wilma 's cash desk , Gino would visit her from his office . He was liaison between all the Neapolitans and the mournful lieutenant who was the major 's assistant . By privilege of his caste Gino wore only a turtle-necked sweater and tweed trousers . He 'd talk long and low to Wilma , their faces scarcely apart . Often he 'd make love to her with a speed and surety and intimacy which caused Giulia to turn her face away . The spectacle of this light bandit love made her sad for hours . When Giulia first took her job at PBS Club , Mamma had all sorts of cautions to her daughter , reminding her that Italian girls were trained to handle men . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always to carry a small dagger ? Giulia laughed painedly and Wilma shrieked at the idea as they sat sipping coffee by Mamma 's couch . For indeed Giulia did carry about her an armor deceptive as a cobweb . Officers used to lean over her by the hour . They asked her what was the Italian word for love . They told her that she was as lovely as their sister Elaine . Sometimes at closing time when they were tight Giulia noticed something painful and cruel in their eyes , but it faded when they looked at the down on her cheeks . She knew what they wanted of her , but no one ever framed it to her . And Giulia came to learn much of the world 's men simply by observing them . She doubted that she 'd marry Pasquale when he came back from his imprisonment in Oran . One evening in August , 1944 , she was sitting on her small enclosed throne , the cash desk of the bar at PBS Officers ' Club . The boys were jammed four deep at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The officers kept up a roaring and a laughing over their drinks , a curtain which was in its turn pierced by the public-address system piping in the orchestra from the dance floor . For the major was determined that in no place in the club should there be any silence . He told the sad lieutenant who was his office boy ( and the lieutenant told Giulia ) that they were endeavoring to avoid that stuffiness which always endangers a men 's club . By now Giulia was used to American noises and to the American idea of living loudly and in public . The dais on which she sat was so walled that in her six-hour shift she could cross or uncross her legs without anybody 's seeing the results . At her right hand she had a stack of chit books and a lined roster to be signed by all who bought her tickets . At her left was an English dictionary and a copy of Uncle Tom 's Cabin . She 'd make her sale with an automatic swift smile , then reimmerse herself in her novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears , and she could forget that she was the only woman in a vaulted roomful of drinking men . She was halfway through Uncle Tom . Next she 'd lined up Gone With the Wind , which she possessed in both English and Italian . By collating both copies she figured that in another month her English would have arrived at perfection . Long ago she 'd dropped the Oxford accent she 'd learned from her maestra at the liceo . On this August night the officers had n't bothered her . In eight months at PBS Club she 'd polished up the brushoff tactics Wilmap241had taught her . But just now opposite her leaning on the bar was a most simpatico person . On one tab of his collar he had a silver cross . By a little questioning Giulia proved to herself what she 'd guessed when she first saw him  --  that he was a priest . He was drinkinggin and juice . He minded his own business , except that every so often he gave her a kind smile . He spoke to her in both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word in her novel , he 'd explain it to her , poising his brown finger on the pages of her book . This chaplain 's hair was cropped to the bone . His face had the glow of a child . To Giulia he was a contrast with all the other American officers at the bar , whose faces were angry or soiled or lined or predatory.  --  Have you many Simon Legrees in America ? Giulia asked , lookingup from her book . Her forehead was resting on her hand.  --  Oh lots , the priest said laughing . But we 've taken their horsewhipsaway from them.  --  I take this book home with me every night , said Giulia . Last night I read where Little Eva dies , and I cried myself to sleep . The priest laughed again and rocked back and forth on his combat boots.  --  Giulia , you 're great . I wish some of the bobby-soxers in my Boston parish could see you . They would n't believe you existed . ... Crying yourself to sleep over a book ! . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . but not now . She laid her novel face down and searched his face . The bar was weighted with the stifling August air . She felt the tiny ringlets fan over her moist brow.  --  Am I so different , Father ? she asked earnestly.  --  Well , frankly , Giulia , you 're out of this world ... . Then his face rushed a wild crimson , and he set down his glass and turned away.  --  Good night , Giulia , and God bless you.  --  Good night , Father , and thank you . She watched him leave the bar through its lurid smoke . He was with the 3rd Division , which was crowding the streets of Naples . She 'd heard that soon there 'd be an invasion of southern France . That was why in August , 1944 , you could n't turn around in Naples for the alnericani . There were more of them here now than she remembered when the city fell in October of last year . Giulia sighed and resumed her novel . She found that her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harriet Beecher Stowe . SP she shut her book and thrust it under her dictionary.  | Then there came to the only open space at the bar a florid major clasping the waist of an American nurse . Giulia 'd never got used to seeing women in officers ' greens and wearing lieutenant 's bars . Most of the American nurses had been gracious to her , saying that she was a dream . But this major and this nurse exuded an ugly reckless giddiness of alcohol . The nurse snuggled into the major and chuckled . She was a stout blonde , her cap set madly on her dyed hair . She had also a double chin . She began to size up Giulia , going all over her dreary Mother Hubbard with eyes like a parrot's.  --  Sell me some chits , baby , the major said . Do n't just sit there and look like a doll.  --  Please sign the paper , Giulia said , pushing it and a pen toward him.  --  Well , just who does she think she is ? the nurse said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes watered , but she said nothing.  --  A mighty pretty piece of quail , the major said to the nurse , indicating Giulia with a whistle.  --  Herbert , the nurse said , do n't give me any of that crap that she reminds you of your daughter . I 've heard that crap out of you before . The nurse leaned her head on the major 's shoulder and closed her eyes . Her double chin bobbled while she swallowed her drink . Then she leaned close to Giulia.  --  Why do n't you use lipstick , girlie ?  --  I have naturally good color , Giulia said . And lipstick is hard to get in Naples this year . And if I put too much on , my mother would have me wash it off .. .  --  Well , listen to that now , said the nurse . Do n't get on your high horse with me , girlie . I have to take enough crap on the ward in the daytime . I did n't come here to have the likes of you insult me .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case you do n't realize it , girlie . I 've a good mind to report you to the military manager . . . . I could have you thrown out on Via Roma with the rest of them . . .  --  Oh dry up , Mary , the major said . Why do n't you buy her some lipstick from your own PX ?  --  I 'd croak first , the nurse said , her double chin jiggling . Let 's get the hell out of this flea joint . . . . Get the jeep and drive me back to Aversa .... I 'm all sweaty . I ca n't beat this damn heat.  |  --  And just mind your p 's and q 's with me , girlie , she added to Giulia . I 'd hate to tell you what I think of you Ginso women . The nurse and her major went out of the bar nudging one another , the major protesting that hq had n't made eyes at Giulia . Giulia watched their exit . Then she laid her head in her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his girls look sharp on duty . Through the open windows of the Bank of Naples looking out on Via Rome the sultry music of the Neapolitan night came up to Giulia , an undertone discernible even through the rumble of the officer 's bar . She could all but distinguish the press of the women 's heels on the pavements beneath her , could almost see the Neapolitanslounging in doorways and the scugnizz ' peddling things till they must leave the streets at curfew hour . This murmur of her own town had a certain meaning for Giulia . The simulated gaiety of the Americans in their bar had none . She was weary . The very repose of sitting and selling chits or sandwiches for eight months was beginning to fatigue her . Wilma and the other girls could break the monotonly by ducking down behind the cassa for a quick cigarette . Lately she noticed that she 'd a headache when she walked away from the club around midnight . Perhaps it was the war . Perhapsit was Naples in August , 1944 . Perhaps she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to her that her life was assuming the quality of a grinning automaton who worked on the four-o'clock shift . She knew that she was giving nothing of herself , that she was turning into a slightly stale vase of flowers ... .  --  Buck up , Giulia , said an officer , buying some chits . Life is real , life is earnest.  --  Yes , Giulia said , lowering her eyes.  --  So ye wo n't talk to me tonight ? the officer said , waggling a finger . Okay , do n't . I 'll go and shoot the breeze with Wilma . She 's naughty . . . . I like em naughty . Why don'tcha wise up and get naughty too ? He left her in an irritation . Giulia sold more books of chits , but all the time her mind was running in its own groove . She thought of her fidanzato Pasquale . Every week his letters came from the PAW enclosure in Oran . They were flatulent and lamenting , living over the years 1940 and 1941 . They were full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that Italy and the Italians were done for . And Giulia thought of the Neopolitan girls she 'd grown up with . Either they 'd gone giggling over to the Allies for what they could get , or else their mothers had locked them up for the duration . She knew that the lives of all Neapolitans had been cut in two . They might all be said to have died ; yet she doubted if they 'd had a rebirth , though their bodies went right on living . Only herself seemed unchanged , moving in some orbit of her own that had no relation to any reality . On this night in August , 1944 , Giulia was lonely . She was the only Neapolitan girl who was hewing to her own destiny , as though the war had never been . Thus now in her breast she felt a pulse of fierceness and resentment when she looked at the Naples of August , 1944 . There was nothing here now that offered her any consolation or the old quiet delight she once took from life : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her girl friends ( she 'd none now , though she visited many ) , and that old pleasure she used to get from combing out her hair before going to bed . All these simple processes and habits had become routine and zestless to her . She felt like a starving person who has lost the taste for food . She wondered if she were dying of staleness. -0 Dio mio , she said fiercely to herself , su , sul coraggio ! .. . She wondered to what a pretty pass she 'd come that often now she carried on dialogues with herself . And it was all very simple , for she saw clean through the rhetoric of Italian . She wished to be loved . This craving had crystallized in Giulia during her eight months at PBS Club . But she wished to be loved according to the old standards of honor passed down through generations of Italian mothers . She was n't interested in something mad and fragrant for a few nights , such as she saw all about her in Naples of August , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the right path to be loved according to her lights . She saw the purpose of her training , to be an Italian girl of softness and dignity . Nearly all Italian women had these traits . But many had abandoned them in the catastrophe that was rending Italy . Giulia had abandoned nothing . Now as a result of still living as she 'd been taught to live , she found herself like an island , off by herself . She wondered if she were mad . She feared she 'd schooled her soul for something that could never again materialize in Italy . She was objective enough to know that in a normal time she 'd have had a quietly happy life . She 'd have been a good wife and a good mother . That was what women did best . But how were these things to be now ? Sometimes she got such a perspective on herself that she seemed a quiet feast set on a tablep245to which no man would ever come . Now the food was growing cold , and all the loving pains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resist laying her face in her hands . She felt her tears squeezing through her tightly locked fingers.  --  Why you 're crying , a voice spoke to her . Ma Lei non deve piangere cosi amaramente . . . . Perche ? She looked up and made a grab for the handkerchief that an American captain whom she 'd never seen was holding out to her . She peered swiftly up and down the bar . Everyone was drunk and talking wildly . No one had noticed her disgraceful giving-way . The tears in her eyes stopped quite suddenly . She turned away her head from the American captain and blew her nose . Reality returned to her in wave upon wave of mortification.  --  Metterei volentieri mille fazzoletti Sua disposizione , the captain said . Her joy at being addressed in formal Italian by an American made Giulia weak . She gripped both sides of her cash desk , smiled stupidly , and returned his handkerchief to him . She reached blindly for her green bag to take out her own.  --  You must n't speak Italian to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American.  --  Now who taught you that pretty speech ? the captain said . I know you 're too sharp a girl to think that the people who come to this club are your friends . So do n't begin with a hypocrisy .. . let 's be honest with one another from the start , shall we ?  --  Yes , said Giulia , I do so want someone to be honest with . The brazen sound of this speech in English ( she still thought in Italian ) stunned her . She felt her color coming up over the shapelesscollar of her Mother Hubbard.  --  Yes , the captain said , setting down his glass , let us be completelyhonest with one another .... I 'll be honest with you . You 're the loveliest girl I 've ever laid eyes on . And your loveliness comes . . . from being . . . just there . . . . I walked into this smelly strained room , expecting to find nothing . And I find you . . . just ... there . . . how wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain was the ugliest man Giulia had ever looked upon . His face was square . In his combat boots he looked like a wooden robot . His hair was gray at the temples . Yet when he smiled or gestured with his long gentle hands , or when he spoke , it seemed to her that granite dissolved into music . He was so hideous that he made her want to laugh , as at a gnome in a fairy tale . Yet her laughter at him turned back on herself . In his first contact with her this captain had beckoned her into a peace in which he himself moved . This peace was n't specious . Giulia sensed it was a solid block which only his death could shatter . Within five minutes she thought that this captain had always been resident some place inside her , had chosen this moment to step out and introduce himself . For he had a way of allaying her doubts before she uttered them . He knew her , and she knew him , as though all their lives they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , the captain said . That 's better . Tell me that you never smiled at anyone that way before.  --  No , said Giulia , hardly daring to look at him , I never have . For the rest of the evening till the bar closed Giulia and the American captain talked together . Quietly , when the spirit moved them to say something ; casually , without effort . He leaned opposite her on the bar . Never too near or too familiar , because the externals were n't necessary . Something else in them was touching . And there was respect for each other 's privacy , like two civilized people bowingin a maelstrom . The bar ceased to exist for them . Giulia continued to sell chits . Even when she took her eyes from him to count chits or change or to speak to the officer purchasing , she knew that this captain was with her . From this moment on he would n't leave her . Some force had come up under her and was buoying her up as she 'd never swum before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trait of beauty to make a man desirable . Then a laugh of the wildest joy would seem to smother her . He responded to everything she thought or said as though , well , that was exactly what he 'd expected her to think or say.  --  We 're not mad , the captain said . Sanity is so marvelous . Yet Giulia in her bed that night was sure she was mad . She laughed and cried till the sun came up over Naples . Looking at her sorry face in the morning , she laughed again and fell back on her bed.  --  Si , sono pazza , she said . Non potrei essere cosi felice ... . That afternoon Giulia knew she 'd gone mad , but in a precise and scheming way . She put on and took off nearly all her dresses . She experimented with her hair , ending by doing it the old way with the delta of ringlets around her brow . Mamma from her couch kept calling out Whatever on earth was the matter with Giulia ? And Giulia only smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally she put on her green frock , her green shoes , her green Meravigliosa hat with the green bow . Then she tucked under her arm the copy of Uncle Tom 's Cabin and thep247English dictionary . Mamma , inspecting her , pointed out that today was neither Sunday nor a giorno di festa . To which Giulia replied that , given the right frame of mind , every day was a giorno di festa . She went down into the streets of Naples . In August , 1944 , the city had a smell of baking stone shot through with the spicy tang of mandarini sold in the corner wagons . In that salita where Giulia lived the corrugated iron walls of the public urinal impregnated the air with an acrid fume poignant as history . She walked quickly along humming to herself that tune " Polvere di Stelle " by Hoagy Carmichael . She swung her green bag so gaily that shoeshine boys in the public garden of Piazza Municipio turned round at their stands and called out to her invitations that had an American tone of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an American port battalion was quartered ; the GI 's were hanging out of their balcony windows in their undershirts , chewing gum and swapping with one another observations on current events and Neapolitan girls with whom they were shacking . Giulia 's passage provoked a madrigal of whistles . The sentinel at the barbed wire , a GI of more feudal heritage , presented arms to her . Ordinarily she 'd have cast down her eyes and felt her body go taut , but today she smiled and looked him straight in the face.  --  Come stare ? Tu molto buono , the sentinel said , shifting his carbine back to its shoulder sling.  --  Grazie assai , Giulia said . Wilma and Gino were living together in two rooms on Via Diaz . They were quite comfortable by pooling their salaries from PBS Club and by drawing American rations that Gino 'd promoted from the quartermaster . They were easily the happiest unwed couple in all Naples . Their prosperity and their love were supported by the Americans , whom they both cherished with the cynical devotion of people below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped she would , taking the sun from their second-story balcony , leaning on the railing and holding hands . They talked incessantly to each other , Gino 's mouth against Wilma 's hidden ear , whispering ironies and passions . Gino was wearing his turtle-necked sweater and a pair of white flannels . His brilliantined curls wriggled like garter snakes in the Neapolitan sunlight . Wilma had on . a blue silk kimono . The white globes of her breasts twinkled in the sun . Her blue hair was low over her forehead ; her rouged and mascaraed face made her features sharp and clear to Giulia , who was standing thirty feet below the doting couple . Wilma sent up her scream of welcome .  --  Ho bisogno di te , Giulia called up to the balcony , beckoning urgently up to Wilma.  --  Giulietta , aspetta an po ' ! Wilma cried and vanished from thebalcony , roguishly tucking her kimono about her creamy shoulders.  --  Ciao , Giulietta , Gino said , leaning out over Giulia.  --  Ciao , Gino , said Giulia . After a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They waved good-by to Gino on his balcony and whisked off along Via Medina at a businesslike clip . Wilma 'd put on a dramatic hat with a veil and had applied more paint so that her generous flamboyant face glistened like porcelain under the veil . With her breezy tact she did n't even inquire what Giulia wanted of her . Obviously she remembered her ancient promise to be Giulia 's chaperone in any emergency.  --  Come mai sei cosi cambiata in una notte ? Wilma said chuckling . By this one sentence Giulia knew that this wise girl was in on her secret . Wilma smoked a cigarette through the mesh of her veil , giving her the appearance of a network on fire . They turned up Via Diaz , arriving at the Intendenza di Finanza Building . In August , 1944 , this was the headquarters of the Peninsular Base Section . Without any difficulty they got by the MP and into the cool foyer , for Wilma had a pass . As they seated themselves on the bench by the information booth , Giulia suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Wilma gave out a jolly cackle , patted her hand , and said that Giulia for quite some time had been spoiling for an American . They did n't say much while they waited . Giulia 's body went into her usual meek relaxation . Inside however she felt like a faggot of dynamite . Wilma smoked two cigarettes . At all officers who passed by she gave a benign look . For by now Wilma and Giulia knew every American officer in Naples who drank at PBS Club . Some stopped and kissed Wilma 's hand and exchanged veiled obscenities with her . And they bowed and said Hi to Giulia . Wilma held a little salon in the cortile . At seventeen hours the court filled up with officers and GI 's coming down from the offices above . The GI 's went shooting out into the streets of Naples for their mess and the long questing Neapolitan evening . The officers carried themselves more stuffily . They moved in tight groups , talking shop and vengeance and promotions . For the PBS officers were quite different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front . Giulia watched them all go by from under her green bonnet . It was like counting sheep . She peered quickly at the faces of each , then lowered her eyes to the green bows of her tiny slippers.  --  Dov'e , dov'e ? Wilma whispered nervously . She was taking it almost as hard as Giulia herself . After a stretch of watching faces and confessing to a sinking feeling that maybe He was n't coming after all , and wondering whether she 'd gone too far , Giulia suddenly planted her elbow against Wilma 's fruity flank.  --  Eccolo the viene , Giulia said . Wilma gave a sigh and gathered herself up in her noblest manner . Her Captain came gravely toward them . He 'd been planting his khaki cap over his right ear . Catching sight of them , he dropped his hands to his sides , then squared out in a gesture of surprise and welcome . His ugly face fired into a smile . Giulia heard Wilma sigh again , gustily.  --  Ma ! . . . said Wilma , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Giulia made Her Captain a curtsy of humility and joy . She introduced him to Wilma , who broke out into praise and effusions . It was one of those things that Wilma did gorgeously well , pretendingthat she was merely renewing the acquaintance of the person presented to her . But all the while ( Giulia knew ) from under the veil Wilma 's merciless witty eyes were giving Her Captain an appraisal like the last judgment . Nothing escaped Wilma . It was for this reason Giulia 'd brought her along : to comply with South Italian standards of decorum , and also to check on her own perceptions.  --  Ma parla cosi bene italiano ! Wilma squealed graciously . For a few minutes they all three spoke in Italian . Wilma and Giulia 's Captain outdid one another in gallantries and compli. ments . Giulia just watched and listened , her gray eyes going from one face to the other . Inside she felt proud and gay , for it was already clear that Wilma and Her Captain liked and respected each other . Buon indizio . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort . Both realized that conversationof this civilized order was a means to an end . Giulia herself was by no means so glib . She was accustomed to sit in a corner and reflect gravely to herself . Yet she derived a delight in watching Wilma and Her Captain hit it off Then Her Captain took Giulia 's arm ever so lightly , as though a feather had insinuated itself into the crook of her elbow . And he observed to Wilma in English :  --  I 've been thinking of my girl all day long.  --  You are making no mistake , said Wilma , whose English was slow and stately . There was a pause , seemingly contrived by Wilma , in which Giulia and Her Captain looked at each other . Their eyes interlacedin hunger and questioning , and Giulia 's small doubts were again put at rest . There came to her again that odd mad peace , that sense of being pulled out of the tempest and the dark , of flying upward into the sun . Giulia felt giddy , and she heard Wilma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eh ?  --  Ma si , said the captain . Ma si . Un tesoro ... .  --  Ciao , Giulia , the captain said.  --  Ciao , capitano , Giulia answered . The words came from deep within her.  --  I invite you both to tea , the captain said . He placed himself in the middle , took both their arms , and they walked out into Naples . For Giulia the sun had never been so warm , the browns and grays of Napoli so rich . She looked at the thousands of Neapolitans scurrying on Via Roma , screaming and gesticulating and worrying ; and she found herself blessing them all : the weary widows , the frenetic scugnizz ' , the anxious studenti and studentesse burbling about their examinations and the spleen of their professors . All the while during their walk Her Captain and Wilma chattered of tiny nothings and amenities . Giulia did n't feel as though she were left out of the conversation , but rather that with their words they were making a garland for her . They were both aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made for a cafe . The bars were just opening . In the center of the Galleria , the focus of the cross that was its floor plan , a Neapolitan in the middle of a crowd talked against Russia and Il Comunismo . A trio of Italian soldiers hissed and made scissors motions toward the hair of a girl in conference with American GI 's . Children scooted along the walls selling cameos and carrying trays of fried fish and dough . And through the Galleria ran a rumble as though they were all underground . For the first time in a year Giulia could look at all these human faces and feel that maybe there were n't too many people in the world after all.  |p251They  sat down at the wicker table of a cafe on the pavement of the Galleria . Giulia had never appeared in public before without Mamma or Papa . Her Captain helped her shed her green coat over the back of her chair . For Wilma and herself he ordered a torta , a dish of ice cream , and an orangeade . Wilma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gossiping without pause . She and Giulia 's Captain discussed Badoglio , Hitler , and American movies . It was n't the sort of discussion in which Giulia was at home . But she listened and smiled and shifted her eyes from one to the other as though she were a spectator at a tennis match . In former times she 'd have thought herself a nitwit not to be able to engage in their repartee , but now she knew it was n't really necessary . She felt like closing her eyes and just listening.  --  This is a conversation piece , Her Captain told her .  --  A what ? Giulia asked , reaching for her dictionary.  --  A way for ladies and gentlemen to pass their time whenthey 've nothing better to do.  --  Must I learn how to do it ? Giulia asked worriedly.  --  I wish you would n't , the captain said gravely .  --  I do n't want you to be a bluestocking.  --  Blue stockings ? said Giulia , looking down at her own . Do American girls wear those ? She suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her.  --  You just be Giulia , the captain said . No American girl could do that , you see . Then Wilma changed her rhythm and got off into a long Italianate speech of set pattern , in which she enumerated Giulia 's qualities , as though she were preaching a funeral sermon . She spoke feelingly of Giulia 's reserve , piety , industry , and frugality . Then she finished off with a conundrum twist , that she doubted whether Giulia would marry an American . They were n't finegrainedenough for Giulia , Wilma thought.  --  No ? said the captain , lighting Wilma 's cigarette . Giulia saw herself as a statue in green hat , green dress , and green shoes , perched on an auction block . She began to feel ill at ease and wished that Wilma would stop talking . She began almost to wish that Her Captain were n't there either , that she could be alone in her room and brood for a little while . It seemed to her that an issue was being forced and shaped by conventions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so natural . Then she began to wonder if there were n't something more than a little mad about herself , too secret and private and egoistic . But at this very moment Her Captain reached over , took the tips of her fingers , and squeezed them lightly.  --  Giulietta is not of this world , Wilma said laughing .  --  She 's not worldly , the captain corrected . And they walked in their threesome back along Via Roma . It was time for Giulia and Wilma to climb the stairs of the Bank of Naples , slip into their chaste Mother Hubbards , and go on duty for the evening . But at the entrance to the club Wilma suddenly said grazie and arrivederLa to the captain and dashed upstairs , leaving them alone together . Giulia was dazed and embarrassed . She prepared to say arrivederLa to Her Captain and follow Wilma . But Her Captain laid his long hands on her shoulders . She saw a convulsion cross his dark hard features . Then he kissed her fingers.  --  My darling , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Giulia turned slowly away in hot tears . She groped her way up the stairs like a blind girl . Reversing the principles of Italian courtship , Giulia took the initiative because Her Captain was a straniero . She suddenly found herself so strong and resourceful that she feared she might be wearing the figurative pants , like those American women who appeared on the streets of Naples with slacks emphasizing their buttocks . In this period of Giulia 's love Wilma was her second , embodying all the traditional functions of duenna , cicisbeo , and arbiter . It was a role that Wilma loved because her nature gloried in all duplicities . At thirty-one Wilma had a heart as rich and scheming as a dowager or matriarch of eighty . If Giulia in her poised timidity made the balls , it was Wilma who aimed them and fired them to their mark . The process was simply this : gradually to lead Her Captain by threads of silk into Giulia 's house , where his intentions would be sounded out . If he passed all the Neapolitan tests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of steel . Her Captain , knowingItalian and the Italians , saw clearly what was going on behind the scenes and grinned within himself . He suffered himself to be led to the slaughter , as cheerful as a sacrificial heifer . He never made any of the breaks or gaucheries perpetrated by most Americanswhen they enter the European marital labyrinth . Giulia 's brother Gennaro was the first hurdle to leap , a prickly one in his position as Younger Brother . Gennaro still worked evenings as a waiter at PBS Club . In one year Giulia 'd seen himp253change from something adored and gilded into a bitter and handsomeNeapolitan , out for Number One . He dealt in American cigarettes and food . He was now quite rich . Giulia believed that he was the lover of an American WAC captain . He kept his job at the club only to maintain some respectability in Mamma 's eyes . Giulia of course ( and Papa to a lesser extent ) had no illusions about Gennaro . It was Wilma , the great fixer , who delivered the first coup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's office at the Bank of Naples she presented Giulia 's Captain to Giulia 's brother . Five minutes later she reported to Giulia that the encounterhad been as economical and efficacious as lightning . The captain had offered Gennaro a cigarette and lit it . They 'd looked at one another like boxers in their corners . Then , Wilma said , Gennaro had folded his hands on his breast in Neapolitan exhortationand had said in his brand-new business Americanese :  --  Captain , you know my sister is strictly a ragazza per bene ?  --  That fact has always been uppermost in my mind , the captain said.  --  And are you going to take her to America with you as your wife ?  --  I do n't look upon your sister as a week-end vacation , the captainhad said , bristling at the directness , yet aware that it was necessary . Two days later things got going like a clockwork juggernaut . Giulia 's Mamma invited Giulia 's Captain to coffee . The affair followed the rules for the first formal encounter of all parties to the imminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Giulia , Wilma , Gino , and Elvira the dowd . To mark the austerity of the occasion Giulia 's ninety-year-old paternal grandmother was brought in from Caserta . This old lady was there to play the role of devil 's advocate , lecturing on the risks of marriage and citing fearful examples of Neapolitan girls who 'd been betrayed by Americansand Negroes . In honor to the occasion , angina or no , Mamma got out of her sheepskin slippers and rose from her couch . She forgot about her heart condition and rustled about the apartment in black silk , giving instructions on the disposition of the coffee service and reminiscing on how such matters were carried off in Firenze when she was a girl . Wilma brewed the coffee ( American ) strong and black . She 'd also stolen from PBS Club several dozen eclairs and sandwiches made of Spam . These were all set formally on silver trays of Mamma 's dowry.  | When Giulia 's Captain , precisely at sixteen hours , knocked on the apartment door , he was admitted by Gennaro to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the couch sat Mamma , her double chin and moles propped over her black silk gown , her fingers queenly with rings . She did n't look at the captain till he was presented to her . At Mamma 's right hunched the grandmother in mauve lace , muttering to herself the part she was to play and peeringabout with bleary Cassandra eyes . Papa paced up and down the salotto with a thick bitten cigar in his hand . He wore his gold watch chain . Giulia sat demurely by herself on a leather ottoman . She must pretend that she had nothing at all to do with the ceremonies , that she was a timid and nubile slave girl about to be sold to the highest bidder . She 'd known this role since she was a tiny girl . But she 'd never imagined that some day it would come her turn to play it . The introductory sallies and pleasantries took five minutes . Papa in his excitement was lordly and dictatorial . Once he wept . The entire trope was conducted in Italian , everyone using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle class . The paternal grandmother kept lapsing into dialect . Gennaro occasionallylapsed into choice Americanese . Papa , as a kind of marital toastmaster , made his introductory remarks , keyed to Naples in August , 1944 . He spoke of the collapse of fascism , of the liberating Allies . Then he became eloquent on prices and the black market . This second section of his prepared discourse was punctuated by comments and illustrative examples from Gennaro and Gino . Next it was Mamma 's turn . She folded her delicate hands in her great lap . In her wheezy voice she confessed that Giulia had been engaged to a Neapolitan sottotenente called Pasquale . But that person was to be considered dead because he was an unrepentant Fascist and a prisoner of war at Oran . Pasquale 's family had releasedGiulia from her bond . Then Mamma launched into Giulia and Giulia 's upbringing . She gave a picture of Giulia 's faults and virtues . But since Giulia was a ragazza seria , her virtues outweighed her faults . The captain was invited to form the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To all this Giulia 's Captain smiled and nodded whenever . Mamma gasped for breath :  --  Ehhhhh , si , gentile signora ... . Then there was the third and grim act before the refreshments could be served . The paternal grandmother talked for twenty minutes , with gestures , on vice among young women . After itsp255initial hoarseness her voice was as great as Duse 's , falling in periods and strophes through the dingy apartment . She sniffed at Neapolitantrash that walked Via Roma , but discounted these girls as having always been cattive . Then she mentioned a higher percentage of girls who had once been good , but now prostituted themselves to the Allies per qualche scopo . She whispered of a lurid marriage in which a Neapolitan girl had imagined herself legally joined to an American MP , only to discover that they 'd been wed outside the church , and now had a child on the way without any legal proof of who was the father . But the paternal grandmother finished in radiance and optimism , picturing a tiny percentage of good Italian girls who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right man came along . And to all of this Giulia 's Captain made the proper comment :  --  Ma si figuri un po ' , che strazi , che sofferenze ... . Everybody relaxed after the speeches were over . Giulia from her ottoman smiled on Her Captain . The captain and Papa and Gino and Gennaro had some men 's talk , weighty and discerning . Giulia and Wilma withdrew to the kitchen and whisked out the coffee and the sweets . Mamma allowed the captain to kiss her cheek , under a mole . Everybody praised everybody else . The air twittered with Italian delight . The world was good after all . And the paternal grandmother , in reaching greedily for her ninth eclair , fell into the hammered silver tray and got chocolate icing all over her lavender lace . Now that she 'd complied with all the formalities , Giulia was free of certain restrictions , though she was bound by others . The worst machinations were over . She might now , for example , take walks with Her Captain if Wilma came along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up as the captain 's guest in a box for Rigoletto at the San Carlo . But 0 Dio mio , Giulia could go neither alone nor in company to Her Captain 's apartment on Via Santa Brigida . In point of fact she should n't be alone with him anywhereanytime . But Wilma was an indulgent and winking chaperone . Often she contrived to relieve Giulia of her cash desk at the club for one hour at a time . Then Giulia would slip out the back way and meet Her Captain in Piazza Municipio , in the public garden full of rustling figures aimlessly wandering , full of moonlight and queues before the urinals . Then Giulia had one full hour alone with Her Captain . They 'd walk hand in hand along Via Caracciolo . The bay was cobalt under the August moonlight . He 'd point out to her the shipping that teemed on the water , the land- ing craft for infantry , sharp metal wedges that rode low on the tide , the sulking hospital ships . It was on Via Caracciolo that Giulia got her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , that I must lose you . I 'm too happy ... . They were leaning by a little altar to Neptune in a niche with sculpted conch shells . Below them the fishermen had beached their boats on a mole , wooden-bellied crescents of tar piled along one another like dead whales . Sometimes the light of a motorboat slashed their faces . In an interlude of darkness he tilted up her chin and covered her mouth with his . He drew in her lower lip like a little fig . Giulia was inundated by a new sensation . Concentric circles flowed out from her heart till her whole small body shook . Her hand went around his neck , and they swayed together in the hot darkness . His fingers slipped up from her waist . She felt she was being invaded with a warmth terrible and sweet , a presentimentof dying with delight . Her breath choked up in her throat ; she felt that she was being crushed . Something red and beaconlike flickered in her mind , crying Not Yet , Not Yet . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mind intact , she released herself.  --  Puritan , he said . By God , you 'll be both wife and mistress , Giulia.  --  We must be getting back , she said in joy and terror . In the next days Her Captain seemed to have sloughed off most of his marvelous peace . He chafed at the politics and meanness of base section life . He said he had n't been happy since he left his tank outfit . Each day he told her of friends killed a few hundred kilometers to the north of them . Then he began to lecture her on her adjustment to American life . He told her sadly that to be happy as his wife in America she must convert her personality . He said she was too utterly dependent on him . That an American wife was something quite different from an Italian wife , shut up in the house with her children . His words hurt her , though she never told him so.  --  And it 's this paradox that saddens me , he said . I fell in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart from all cheapness . You 're everything that women have always insisted that they were , yet rarely succeeded in being . I wonder if in America you could stay that way.  --  You think I 'm not real ? she said hotly . You think me incapable of being myself anywhere ?  --  I know , I know . . . but the noblest Italian life does n't belongP257in the twentieth century at all . . . . There seems to be no more room for flowers in this world.  --  I may be a flower , said Giulia , puzzled and piqued , but I think I have roots . . . and . . . what you call in American . . . guts.  --  It 's the guts of woman , he said moodily , that ability to be proue without insulting , to stand childbirth and sacrifice . . . . But you scare me because I ca n't find a trace of bitchiness in you.  --  Do you want there to be ?  --  God no , my darling , he said , sighing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comic relief that she was stronger than he . That was the way it was decreed to be . She looked detachedly at her superiority with an odd wistfulness . It might be something given her to serve her in the long years ahead . One night he came to their meeting with an air restless and sheepish . It did n't become him . Hand in hand they walked for fifteen minutes along Via Caracciolo . She waited , listening to him with a new ear that had been born in her . At last they stopped and looked out at the bay from the railing.  --  Sei nervoso , she said reproachfully . Hai qualche segreto .. . He took her hand and rubbed her fingers.  --  Yes , Giulia , I have . . . . Tomorrow I 'm leaving for the front . I put myself in for it . I thought it over for a long time . I 'm going back to the tanks . . . . It 's not fair to you , but it 's the way I feel . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For that 's where I belong . . . . I 'm sick to death of all the Americans in Naples , with their villas and their jeeps and their mistresses . Something snapped in Giulia 's heart . She gushed with a woe she had n't dreamed possible in this world . She felt that God had tricked her shabbily.  --  You must do what you think is right , she said gently , controllingherself.  --  Is that your heart or your brain talking ?  --  Do n't be cruel to me . . . it 's both . They had a long silence . Vesuvius glowed weakly on both its peaks.  --  Giulia . . . you must stay with me tonight . . . . Get Wilma to tell your mother you 're visiting your grandmother in Caserta . She felt her nails gouge into her palms.  --  I thought you were different from the rest , she said.  --  I thought so too . But I 've got to make love to you , Giulia , and tonight . . . . Suppose . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and I died without ever having had you ?    --  Then that 's the way it would have to be , she said.  --  You must be made of ice , he said.  --  I 'm not made of ice , she answered , feeling her cheeks scalding . When you touch me I know I 'm not made of ice . . . . I want your love . . . all your love . . . just as much as you want mine . I mean some day to give myself wholly to you . . . and not to any other man . . .  --  You and your codes of respectability , he cried . In wartime they do n't mean a damn . . . . All that matters is that we love one another.  --  I am what I am , Giulia said . I love you . Do you doubt that ? This is the first and last time I 'll love . I 'm made that way . . . . But I wo n't stay with you tonight . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were to be killed next week .. .  --  Thank you , my dear , he said roughly.  --  Oh I know it 's all a game , she said . But I 'm so made that I must play that game . . . call it what you will . . . stuffiness .. . respectability .. .  --  You 're a fool , he said.  --  I 'm anything but a fool , she said and began to cry . I know all the arguments and all the answers . All women do . . . . We have to hold you off till we get a ring on our fingers . . . . My mother and her mother before her played that game . . . . And I shall do so too . . . . Do n't you see , my darling ? The world is built on such games . Most of those games are invented by women for their own protection . . . for their children 's protection . . . . In every woman there are two things all mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . but that 's what makes her a woman . . . . And you , my darling , will never know me in love till I 'm your wife . He said nothing further . They walked back along Via Caracciolo by the statue of Pompey in the little garden with the white railing . Giulia was in agony , yet she smiled to herself . She 'd gladly pass with him one night in which all their love was rolled up into one knot . But against this , something merciless and logical in her saw the possibility of a lifetime of bitterness and loneliness and aridity . It was a gamble she was willing to make . On such odds her whole life had been predicated . They entered the Galleria Umberto , where the life and the motion had died . There remained only the black heat of Naples in August , 1944 . Their loitering footfalls were prescient and austere.  --  My God , Giulia , her Captain said , you 're a fiend.  --  Why , every woman is , she answered . For she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THAT MY HEART FINALLY BROKE IN NAPLES . NOTover a girl or a thing , but over an idea . When I was little , they 'd told me I should be proud to be an American . And I suppose I was , though I saw no reason I should applaud every time I saw the flag in a newsreel . But I did believe that the American way of life was an idea holy in itself , an idea of freedom bestowed by intelligent citizens on one another . Yet after a little while in Naples I found out that America was a country just like any other , except that she had more material wealth and more advanced plumbing . And I found that outside of the propaganda writers ( who were making a handsome living from the deal ) Americans were very poor spiritually . Their ideals were something to make dollars on . They had bankrupt souls . Perhaps this is true of most of the people of the twentieth century . Therefore my heart broke . I remember that this conceit came home to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we Americans had everything . The Italians , having lost their war , had nothing . And what was this war really about ? I decided that it was because most of the people of the world did n't have the cigarettes , the gasoline , and the food that we Americans had . I remember my mother 's teaching me out of her wisdom that the possession of Things implies a responsibility for Their use , that They should n't be wasted , that Having Things should never dominatemy living . When this happens , Things become more important than People . Comfort then becomes the be-and-end-all of human life . And when other people threaten your material comfort , you have no recourse but to fight them . It makes no difference who attacks whom first . The result is the same , a killing and a chaos that the world of 1944 was n't big enough to stand . Our propaganda did everything but tell us Americans theP260truth : that we had most of the riches of the modern world , but very little of its soul . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us ; but when we got overseas , we could n't resist the temptation to turn a dollar or two at the expense of people who were already down . I can speak only of Italy , for I did n't see France or Germany . But with our Hollywood ethics and our radio network reasoning we did n't take the trouble to think out the fact that the war was supposed to be against fascism  --  not against every man , woman , and child in Italy . . . . But then a modern war is total . Armies on the battlefield are simply a remnant from the old kind of war . In the 1944 war everyone 's hand ended by being against everyone else 's . Civilization was already dead , but nobody bothered to admit this to himself . I remember the crimes we committed against the Italians , as I watched them in Naples . In the broadest sense we promised the Italians security and democracy if they came over to our side . All we actually did was to knock the hell out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . And one of the most tragic spectacles in all history was the Italians ' faith in us  --  for a little while , until we disabused them of it . It seemed to me like the swindle of all humanity , and I wondered if perhaps we were n't all lost together . Collective and social decency did n't exist in Naples in August , 1944 . And I used to laugh at our attempts at relief and control there , for we undid with one hand what we did with the other . What we should have done was to set up a strict and square rationing for all goods that came into Italy . We should have given the Neapolitans co-operative stores . I remember watching the American acquisitive sense in action . We did n't realize , or we did n't want to realize , that we were in a poor country , now reduced to minus zero by war . Nearly every GI and officer went out and bought everything he could lay hands on , no matter how worthless it was ; and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 'd buy all the bamboo canes in a little Neapolitanshop , junk jewelry , worthless art  --  all for the joy of spending . Everywhere we Americans went , the prices of everything skyrocketeduntil the lira was valueless . And the Italians could n't afford to pay these prices , especially for things they needed just to live on . For all the food we sent into Italy for relief , we should have set up some honest American control by honorable and incorruptibleAmericans . Instead we entrusted it to Italians who , nine times out of ten , were grafters of the regime we claimed to be destroying . P261I remember too that an honest American in August , 1944 , was almost as hard to find as a Neapolitan who owned up to having been a Fascist . I do n't know why , but most Americans had a blanket hatred of all Italians . They figured it this way : These Ginsoes have made war on us ; so it does n't matter what we do to them , boost their prices , shatter their economy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's some fallacy in my reasoning here . I guess I was asking for the impossible . This was war , and I wanted it to be conducted with honor . I suppose that 's as phony reasoning as talking about an honest murder or a respectable rape . I remember that the commonest , and the pettiest , crime we did against the Neapolitans was selling them our PX rations . We paid five lire a package for cigarettes , which was a privilege extended to us by the people of the United States . To a Neapolitan we could sell each package for three hundred lire . Really big business . A profit of 6,000 percent . Of course the Neapolitans were mad to pay this price for them , but I do n't see that it made our selling any the righter . I do n't believe that these cigarettes were legally ours  --  ours , that is , to sell at a profit . They were only ours if we wanted to smoke them . If we did n't smoke , we had no right to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarettes away . I remember that we went the next step in vulturism and sold our GI clothes to the Neapolitans . Then we could sign a statement of charges and get new ones , having made meanwhile a small fortuneout of the deal . This was inexcusable on any grounds whatever . There are loopholes in my cigarette syllogism , but none that I see on the clothes question . Then I remember that there were not a few really big criminals who stole stuff off the ships unloading in Naples harbor , stuff that did n't belong to them by any stretch of the imagination . For all this that I saw I could only attribute a deficient moral and humane sense to Americans as a nation and as a people . I saw that we could mouth democratic catchwords and yet give the Neapolitansa huge black market . I saw that we could prate of the evils of fascism , yet be just as ruthless as Fascists with people who 'd already been pushed into the ground . That was why my heart broke in Naples in August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our delinquencies were as childishly ingenious as American advertising.  --  If a signorina comes to the door of my mess hall , the mess sergeant said , making a salad , an she says she 's hungry , why , I give her a meal . . . .

And for those Neapolitans to whom I sometimes gave Italians who have n't too much of this world 's goods is that they love life and love . I do n't know what else there is , after all . Even in their frankness the Italians were so seldom offensive . An Italian mother told a friend of mine that he could never marry her daughter because he had the face of a whoremaster . And we all laughed . No one was hurt . I remember the passion and the understanding of Italian love . There 's no barrier between the lovers . Everything is oxidized at the moment , without rancor or reservation.  --  Fammi male , amore mio . . . . Fammi godere da movire .. . And I remember the storms and quarrels of Italian love , mostly rhetorical . The going to bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this people , broken and saddened and dismayed , there yet remained much of that something which had made Italy flower  --  though not as a nation of warriors . To this day I 'm convinced of Italy 's greatness in the world of the spirit . In war she 's a tragic farce . In love and sunlight and music and humanity she has something that humanity sorely needs . It 's still there . Somethingof this distillation of noble and gentle grandeur seeps down through most of Italy 's population , from contessa to contadina . I do n't think I 'm romanticizing or kidding myself . In the middle of the war , in August , 1944 , with my heart broken for an ideal , I touched the beach of heaven in Naples . At moments . I remember how the children of Naples pointed my dim conception of American waste . They 'd stand about our mess hall quiet or noisy , watching the glutted riches from our mess kits being dumped into the garbage cans . I remember the surprise and terror in their faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard that combat soldiers , gentler and more determined than we , took the law into their hands and were much kinder to Italian children than we were allowed to be . When I watched the bitten steaks , the nibbled lettuce , the half-eaten bread go sliding into the swill cans in a spectrum of waste and bad planning , I realized at last the problemof the modern world , simple yet huge . I saw then what was behind the war . I 'll never forget those Neapolitan children whom we were forbidden to feed . After a while many of us could n't stand it any longer . We 'd brush past the guard with our mess kit full of supper and share it with Adalgisa and Sergio and Pasqualino . They were only the scugnizz ' of Napoli , but they had mouths and stomachs just like us . I remember the wild hungry faces of those kids diving into cold Spam . But our orders were that since America was in no position to feed all the Italians , we were not to feed any . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . P265But I remember even then thinking and fearing that we 'd come to a day when we too , we rich rich rich Americans , would pay for this mortal sin of waste . We 've always thought that there was no end to our plenty , that the horn would never dry up . Already I seem to hear the menacing rumblings , like a long-starved stomach . But in Naples in August , 1944 , we were on the crest of the wave . We ? We were Americans , from the best little old country on God 's green earth . And if you do n't believe me , mister , I 'll knock your teeth in ... . And I remember well our first facing of the problem that we could n't live in Naples as though there were a wall between us and the Neapolitans . There were American clubs and American movies , but only a blind man can carry his life around with him quite that much . Perhaps in Washington the generals had their doubts about the perfect probity of the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would n't come in contact with any other . Consequently we were flooded with American movies and with Coca-Cola to distract our wandering attention and to insure that we should n't fall into dangerous furren ways of thinking . But some of us wondered none the less . The main leak , I remember , was in sex . It just is n't possible to take millions of American men and shut them off from love for years on end  --  no , not with a thousand other American distractions . Sooner or later every man 's thoughts start centering around his middle . The cold and scientific solution would have been to have brothels attached to all our armies overseas , as other nations of the world have always done . But the American people would n't have stood for that . I mean the American people back home . Too many purity lobbies from old ladies who have nothing else to do but form pressure groups to guard other people 's morals . And there were few women in our army as compared to our own percentage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such a tiny ratio to us . And with the nurses we could n't go out because they were officers . Thus our perfect chastity was theoretically assured . From the hygienic point of view there were pro stations on every corner of Naples . This was a nice paradox in that every interesting alley was off limits . The army took the point of view : You absolutely must notButif by chance you do . . . . Finally they had a restriction on marrying overseas . Then we started casting our eyes on the Neapolitan girls.  --  These Gook wimmin , the mess sergeant said . It 's so easy with em . You just walk down Via Roma an some signorina does all the rest .    --  But , the corporal said , dreamy in his shorts , I do n't wan na hafta pay for it . I just wan na little girl all my own to love.  --  There 's something very nice about Italian women , the pfc with spectacles said . No funny ideas about fur coats and higher income brackets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't feel they have to discuss books with you that they have n't read .. . not that women should n't be emancipated . . . to a certain degree , as companion to man and as his helpmate . . . . But the Neapolitan women are so down to earth . First they cook you a spaghetti dinner . ... Then ... I remember that we GI 's were used to women in a different tradition . American women , with their emancipation , had imposed their own standards on us . In America most Nice Girls Would .. . if you knew them well enough . Nearly all college girls Would , and waitresses too , if they thought there was a reasonable chance of your eventually getting spliced . And as for the separate career women of America , with their apartments  --  well , they 'd abrogated to themselves all the freedom of single men . A Career Girl would keep you , or you kept her , depending on the financial status of one or both . And in America there were lots of rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but did n't dare marry them for fear of what Cousin Hattie would say . But to us GI 's the girls of southern Italy fell into two tight , ' lasses only . That 's where we got stymied . There were the girls of Via Roma , whom the Neapolitans , mincing no words , called puttane . These girls asked fixed prices in either lire or PX rations . They satisfied for a while as long as we had money , but their fee was steep for a GI unless he were a big operator in the black market . And then too something in a man 's vanity craves something other than a girl who 's shacking with Tom , Dick , and Harry . American men are so sentimental that they refuse to have a whore for their girl  --  if they can help it . That 's the schizophrenia of our civilization , with its sharp distinction between the Good Girl and the Bad Girl . Consequently after a few tries , with the fear of VD always suspendedover our heads , we began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered the problem of the GI Italian bride . I remember that Italian girls began to look sweet to us early . Perhaps because their virginity was put on such a pedestal . There were few of us who did n't have access to some Neapolitan home , where we were welcomed , once our entree was definite and our purposes aboveboard . We usually got in through a Neapolitan brother . Then we discovered that there were girls in the family , carefully kept and cherished as novices in a nunnery . It was obvious that theseP267girls were interested in us . . . if we proposed marriage to them.  --  I do n't get a minute alone with Rosetta , the corporal said . They treat me swell at her casa , but Mamma does n't trust Rosetta out her sight for one minnit . An after midnight Papa 's always remindin me what time it is ... as if I did n't have a wrist watch.  --  Ah , I keep to Via Roma , the mess sergeant said . Ya ca n't lay a finger on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the spectacles , a girl once she 's engaged will do anything to satisfy her fiance . . . short of the real McCoy . I do n't get these fine distinctions in tribal ethics.  --  These Ginso girls , the sergeant major said , never forget that they 're women . That 's their strongest and weakest point . They know how to get in ya hair and under ya skin with wantin em till ya have to slide that gold ring on their finger.  --  Onelia told me quite frankly , the corporal said , that she was interested in a passport to the States as my wife . . . . I liked that honesty in her . I guess she likes me too.  --  Us GI 's is so hot , the mess sergeant said , that once we leave Italy , these signorinas will never be satisfied with the Eytie men .. . never again ... . I remember that we Americans brought heartbreak to Neapolitan girls in many instances . There were Negroes who told their shackjobsthat they were n't really black , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were mess sergeants who told nice Neapolitan girls that they owned chains of restaurants back in the States . I 've often wondered at the face of some of those girls of good faith , arriving in the States to discover they 'd live in one cabbage-smelling room over the stairs . There were , I remember , American GI 's and officers who most cruelly betrayed and seduced Neapolitan girls , concealing from them and their families that back in the States they 'd a wife and kids . These girls were n't in the positic.i of an American girl , who knows the language and can make her own investigations . For the heartless deceit of such as these I sometimes felt shame that I was an American because the life of a pure woman is like a mirror , and can be smashed but once . But I also remember instances of love and good faith on both sides . GI 's and officers met Neapolitan girls , fell in love with them , and married them . I see no reason why such marriages should n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made the not easy adjustment to American wifehood . I remember Lydia , the gay shy mouse who sang in the chorus of the Teatro Reale di San Carlo . She was courted and won by our medic . I remember their wedding at Sorrento and their honeymoon at Taormina in Sicilia . Unless the world falls apart , I think that little Lydia and her capitano medico will be as happy in their lives together as human beings ever are outside of fairy tales . I remember Laura , to whom a GI killed at Cassino made two presents . He gave her a baby and a white spirochete . When I see flowers lying crushed in a muddy street , I think of Laura . I remember plump and smiling Emilia , who thought she 'd married an MP . The MP disappeared forever after the wedding , and Emilia just sat in the kitchen night after night and wept so bitterly that her heart would have broken if it had n't already been in tiny pieces . Her mother kept cursing her and asking where were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he 'd put a razor into the first americano he met on a dark night . And I remember Wanda , stately and blonde , who used to sit by the stove and feel the life stirring within her . We all said she was too big to be having just one . And sure enough she came out with twins whom she christened Mario and Maria . They were brilliant gay babies , the way Italian children know how to be . Wanda hoped they 'd grow up strong in St. Louis . She got me to point out that city for her on the map of America . I remember that in Naples in August , 1944 , for all the red tape and the army regulations and the blood tests and the warning talks by chaplains , there was still a great deal of human love . And this rejoiced me . For all the ruin and economic asphyxiation we 'd brought the Neapolitans , we also in some cases gave them a new hope . They 'd been like Jews standing against a wall and waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I began to think that perhaps something good might emerge or be salvaged from the abattoir of the world . Though in the main all national decency and sense of duty might be dead , I saw much individual goodness and loveliness that reassured me in my agony . I saw it in some Neapolitans . I saw it in some Americans . And I wondered if perhaps the world must eventually be governed by individuality consecratedand unselfish , rather than by any collectivism of the propagandists , the students , and the politicians . In Naples in August , 1944 , I drowned in mass ideologies , but was fished out by separate thinking and will . I remember watching the mad hordes in the streets of Naples and wondering what it all meant . But there was a certain unity in the bay , in the August moon over Vesuvius . Then humanity fell away from me like the rind of an orange , and I was something much more and much less than myself ... . P269Queen PenicillinWAKENING THESE MORNINGS IN NAPLES , HE 'D TURN ON HIScanvas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette , and look out at the bell tower of Maria Egiziaca . His consciousness was clear , the way he used to come to as a child and start thinking of what he 'd do today . But the deliciousness of those awakenings had gone . Up till last week he 'd known them with Marisa . But now she 'd gone to Rome . And for days there 'd been something in his mind , something crouching that he could escape only when he slept . All day long it sat on his shoulder whispering the red doubts and fears into his ear . He was free only in those first instants of awaking . But with the first few puffs on his cigarette the Idea came back . This morningIt was especially pressing . Today he 'd Know . He got up and groped down to the latrine . The sunlight had n't yet come into this corridor , but he knew the passageway drunk or sober . In the latrine he voided his bladder and stood looking at his naked body in the mirror . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Marisa 'd loved this color of his skin . He examined his flesh , peering over himself with a wild hushed interest . He knew every inch of himself . Then the Idea broke over him more viciously than in the past four days . His dark skin globuled with sweat . Back in the room he dressed himself quickly . He was shaking . He heard his heart say yes yes yes . And from the other cot Roy was regarding him with sleepy compassion.  --  Goin to find out this mornin ?  --  Yup.  --  Good luck , boy . Ya been sweatin this one out . His boots clattered on the stairs of the palazzo . Naples too was awakening in the August morning . By the windows the sandflies hung poised in their clouds . And he heard the clatter of the carts in the street and the prickly whispering of the women 's brooms as they swept the sidewalks . He walked through the screen door of the mess hall , taking more than his usual pains not to let it slam . The mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked up with an iron petulance.  --  Now what , Jo-Jo ? Ya feelin hung over ?  --  Nope . Got any black coffee ? One of the Neapolitan kitchen help poured him a mess cup full of scalding java and passed it to him.  --  Grazie , Joe , he said.  --  Niente , Joe , the Neapolitan said . The metal lip of the canteen cup singed his lips and his tongue , but the coffee flooded down his throat . Again the sweat seeped out through his shirt . He felt the cup teetering against his teeth from the trembling of his wrist.  --  Ya ai n't feelin good , Jo-Jo ? the mess sergeant said . Ya ai n't been on the beam since ya quit ya shackin .. .  --  Nope , he said , setting down his cup , I ai n't feelin well .  --  Knock her up or somethin ?  --  Nope . Me an Marisa just broke up.  --  Well , they 's plenty more where she came from , the mess sergeant said , shoving a mound of lettuce wearily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want no more . Now in a lewd sweat from the steaming coffee and the reeking Neapolitan morning , he plowed along , his cap on the back of his head and his hands in his pockets . Seeing Vesuvius and the barbed wire round the port enclosures , he decided to smoke a cigarette . As he was lighting his butt with fingers that wobbled , an officer passed . He lowered his eyes.  --  Say , soldier , the lieutenant said , do n't ya salute officers any more ?  --  This ai n't a salutin area , sir .. .  --  Shut up an salute me , the lieutenant said . I do n't know why I do n't take ya name an serial number . . . . Wearin ya dogtags ?  --  Yessir.  --  Well , get on ya way . Next time watch ya step . Not all officers is as square as me . He saluted again and walked on , replacing his hands in his pockets . He put his cigarette in the farthest angle of his mouth.  |p271He  felt that his shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with his eyes on the ground . For he wished that he could pass out quietly some place , that the March eruption of Vesuvius had buried both Naples and himself under lava as stiff as molasses . He cussed and spat against a tree that grew from the sidewalk in his path . There was no one in the Galleria Umberto except some children asleep like sweaty kittens , and little old men who went over the pavement searching for cigarette butts . From the cornices the weather-eaten angels looked snottily down at him from behind their trumpets . He saw the canvases in the art shops as daubs of vermilion and ocher and cobalt . The bars were all shut behind their rolling corrugated blinds . The new sun filled every nook of the arcade , microscopically adumbrating the smears on the walls , the peeling posters , the chipped mosaics in the pavement . And above him the empty skylight crisscrossed the sky like veins in an eyeless socket . He remembered the Galleria in past evenings : blots of light leaking from under the bars till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shrill laughter , and the voices promising annihilation from the heat and the pain . And like a flashlight into his dark hot misery he saw the figure of Marisa swaying in the August darkness , the cleft of her breasts in her gray figured cotton frock , her tiny brown feet . He heard her voice :  --  Vieni , amor mio . . . fammi tua per sempre ... . Thinking of the past , he walked across the Galleria into Via Roma . A Neapolitan kid asked him if he wanted to eat ; so he told him what he could do with himself . On Via Roma there was the sparrowy life of Neapolitans hurrying to work , old ladies fanning themselves with their morning paper , the screams of the cameo dealers as they set up their displays in the porticos of abandoned shops and ruined tenements . British and American convoys rumbled in the pinched street . In the gutters lay squashed oranges and spent rubbers that had been hurled from the windows above . He turned , crossed Via Diaz , and entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood before the red and white canvas sign that read FIFTH GENERAL DISPENSARY . He laid his hand on the bronze maniple of the door . It was as hot as a molten ingot to his palm . He was listening too to his heart throbbing , opening and closing like a spastic fist . It had beat like that when he lay in Marisa 's arms after their lovemaking . . . . Marisa . . . . He felt his knees begin to shake . There seemed to be a pool of ice water in his belly . But he stiffened his legs and pulled the door of the dispensary open.  | It was cool in there . The floor was a pepper-colored parquet . The GI 's who worked there stood behind glass wickets like bank tellers . And in the coolness there was a reek of phenol and antiseptic . As they set up their cages for the day , the GI 's called out to one another their pissin and their moanin . They yelled back and forth criticisms of the breakfast they 'd just eaten. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't I please go home ? To stop the trembling of his knees and the turbine in his chest , he sat down on a bench near the door . He wondered were his eyes bloodshot . He felt like an ulcerous scarecrow sitting alone in the middle of that cool noisy dispensary , with the click and hum of the dental clinic just beyond . The other GI 's were unconcerned and gay . Finally he got up , clutching his cap , and walked to a window that said ADMISSIONS . He ran his tongue over his lips and looked at the floor.  --  Ya too early for sick call , sarge , the corporal back of the plate glass said . Go outside an wait a while ...  --  But I took a blood test ... five days ago , he murmured .  --  Oh ya did ? Imagine that ! Blood tests is SOP in Napoli ...  --  Will ya please do me a favor an look ? he said , giving his name .  --  Okay , okay , sarge , the corporal said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pigeonhole the corporal took a sheaf of small pink slipsand leisurely ruffled through them . With tormenting indifference .  --  I do n't seem to find ya name , Barge .... Oh wait , here it is ... . Outa alphabetical order . . . damn that lab ... . Through a swimming mist he saw the pink slip thrust at him along the counter . A kettledrum was beating in his ears , thudding out Yes Yes Yes and No No No in acceleration . He saw the manicuredfingers of the corporal holding the upper edges of the slip . He read down till he saw the brash rubber stamp and the red crayon comment : Wassermann  --  PosKahn  --  PosEverything inside him seemed to whirl up and go down in crash . Besides the drumming there now came a ringing in his ears . His knees buckled . He gripped the marble counter to keep from dropping to the floor.  --  Tough luck , sarge , the corporal said.  --  What do I do now ? he said , his vision clearing . For his previous weakness there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to a pinpoint in space . And he saw Marisa 's face , her mouth open , her eyes closed , murmuring :  --  O come sai bene amarmi , tesoro mio ... .  --  Just step into number four , the corporal said briskly and professionally . He stumbled along by the cages , clutching the pink slip in his palm , which seemed to be gushing hot butter . He steered through a railing and into a long corridor with clinics and rooms opening off it . He knocked on the door of number four . At a call he opened to find a medical captain washing his hands in a sink and chewing gum in rhythm with the oscillation of his forearms.  --  Mind waiting outside , sergeant ? the doctor called sharply . So he all but lay down on a bench , the slip dangling from his hand . He tried to close his eyes and swallow the searing sensation in his eyes and throat . Finally the sound of running water stopped and the doctor beckoned him in . He thrust the pink slip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreadfuldreadful at last , hey ? You 're one of the bright joes who thinks that the signs and the films are for everybody in the army except himself . . . . And you wo n't be sergeant much longer , boy.  --  Yessir , he said.  --  Well , we 'll start treatment at once . . . . We do n't mess with this .  --  Is there . . . any hope , sir ? he said hoarsely.  --  I 'm no great believer in this new treatment . . . . Take down your pants . Then began the questionnaire , which the captain wrote down .  --  Take a pro after your last exposure ?  --  Nossir.  --  Italian girl , I suppose .... Give me her name and address .  --  Do n't know , sir.  --  Do n't try to protect her through any mistaken notions of chivalry . She gave you a nice burning , and she 'll do it to others . I advise you to give me her name and address.  --  I told ya , I do n't know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the several waiting ambulances , holding in his hand an admission slip to the hospital . One of the ambulance drivers , a tech five , had one of his boots through a window of the ambulance cab.  --  What hospital ya goin to , sarge ?  --  Twenty-third General.  --  Then hop in . Ya can ride in front with me . Just like an officer.  | He climbed into the front , to the right of the driver 's seat . On the line he 'd never had to ride in an ambulance . Now in the rear area of Naples , here he was going to the hospital in style , but not for a wound or for trenchfoot . The tech five pulled his boot inside the window and started his vehicle.  --  What are ya goin to the Twenty-third for , sarge ? Hepatitis ? VD ?  --  Nope , neither . . . just a general checkup . They drove along Via Caracciolo toward Bagnoli Tunnel . And , seeing the Bay of Naples in the August sun , seeing the fishermen already far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of how he and Marisa used to walk and dally here in the bright open moonlight . They 'd lean on the parapet by the docks of Santa Lucia and watch the British sailors coming over the ramp on liberty .... But now he was riding in an ambulance with a tech five who talked all the time , having lit a cigar . The tech five made him listen to all the details of his last night 's shacking.  --  I get me one gal an I stick to her , the tech five said . Then I do n't stand no chance of pickin up nothin nasty . See my point , sarge ?  --  Ya never can tell about them things , he answered vaguely . He wished Marisa would quit his thoughts . He pressed down on his thighs and peered through the ambulance windshield . He knew that Marisa was very much with him . She was even in his veins . They pummeled through the dark dripping gloom of the Bagnoli Tunnel . The overhead inset lights barely pierced the dusty gloom kicked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep in this tunnel during the air raids . . . . And at Bagnoli they turned by the old tenements with the washing on the balconies , the arrows to direct traffic and show the way to the staging areas . Then he got his first look at the Medical Center . Long low modern buildings with friezes and dominant stairs , like WPA American high schools . Unexpected gardens and trellises , phallic arches , and parapets skirmishing like roller coasters out of the pine trees . Excavated rifts piercing white and unfinished out of the hillsides . The tech five explained that Musso had built these grounds for a world 's fair or something , that now the Americans were using them for a concentration of hospitals . They passed plaster statues of ripple-thighed naked young men in Fascist attitudesof victory . A couple of swimming pools . The whole Medical Center had an air like an exhibition : sheets of windows , inscriptions everywhere.  |p275The  tech five stopped his ambulance on an avenue near an MP gate.  --  That 's the Twenty-third right over there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ...  --  Barbed wire ? he said . But I ai n't no prisoner.  --  Just wait , the tech five said , wisely chewing off the tip of a fresh cigar . He got out of the ambulance and walked up a flight of stairs to the barbed wire , over which hung the leaves of low trees and vines . Inside was a great press of people moving around . He thought of the courtyard of a jail during exercise period.  --  No visitors here , Joe , the MP said , raising his carbine to port arms.  --  I ai n't no visitor , he said , presenting his admission slip .  --  Then welcome , the MP said . This the place where shackees repent their shackin ... . There was a series of arrows showing new patients where to go . It was as methodical and cold as his induction into the army . He entered first a long low hut where pfc 's sat at typewriters . In a window a major sat with bored but catty stare . To this medical officer he presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the air of a movie usher seeing a picture for the hundredth time.  --  So you got burned ? the major said . And you 'll be losing those three stripes too.  --  Yessir.  --  I do n't say : Welcome to our hospital . You 're not going to have a good time here . Our whole setup is guaranteed to make you hate everything about us . We do n't want men coming back here , do you see ? There 's no excuse for getting VD . No excuse whatever . We give you treatment here , but we do it in such a way that you wo n't care to come back as a repeater . Yet I see the same faces again and again . Well , it 's their skin . . . . Take down your pants ... .  --  Pretty sight , are n't you ? the major said after the examination . Just as pretty as you saw it in the movies . I 'll bet you said : That 'll never be me.  --  Nossir . After the major had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tongue , he was sent over by a wall where there were chairs with armrests , rubber compresses , and a lot of little glass vials with red stuff in them.  --  Roll up your sleeve , the pfc attendant said.
