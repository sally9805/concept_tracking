on those artists who feel the urge to r creative work , the position today is hazardous and beset with difficulties . We imagine that we have at last emerged into a period of enlightenment. ; that no longer can a Cezanne be misunderstood and neglected , nor a Van Gogh or a Modigliani be unable to earn a living during his lifetime . This is far from true . The creative artist of today is in exactly the same position as his predecessors . He has against him a formidable array of enemy forces , who attack him directly and obliquely . To start with , those who handle his work , the dealers . They are not content to be mere dealers . They wish to be , and often are , the dictators of the artist 's production . They admonish the artist as to what the public will like or dislike , and they can also keep him in poverty , so that he is easier to control . The commonest grouse of the dealer is that the artist is a self-willed person who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I myself have often been asked to furnish the dealer with what he considers the most salable of all work , the small female nude , which can ornament a mantelpiece or a smoking-room table . I have never succumbed to this demand , and it has even set me against this form of sculpture . The really popular works of Maillol are those little nudes , of which I have seen a hundred copies at one time cast by a dealer in Paris , all ready for the market . A landscape artist I know , whose spring and summer landscapes sold well , was advised by his dealers to go on doing spring and summer landscapes , and they looked with disfavor on his attempts to paint autumn and winter landscapes . Also , the subjects which the dealer finds tragic or sinister he often thinks unsuitable for the public . The dealer demands of newcomers 331 per cent of the price of any work sold , and only artists with big reputations can reduce this to RS per cent . The art racket rarely is in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great care that the work does not sell . This can be easily managed , as exhibitions must necessarily be in the hands of the dealers . I once tried this out on a dealer ; he had a work of mine for sale sent in by the owner , who was told that there were no claimants for it . I had sent a friend who admired the work , and who was genuinely interested in it . He could not get any information as to the price by calling or writing . So far as any effort was made to connect him with the object , he was as far off at the end as at the beginning . Naturally the work fell into the dealer 's hands . It was my first carved work in marble , and he put a big price on it . In Gauguin 's letters he complains of a celebrated dealer who handled his work while ho was in the Marquesas , and who kept on writing to him that there was no demand , or even inquiry , about his paintings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his friend to find out if his paintings are really being shown at all . That this dealer had a great quantity of Gauguin 's work later , after his death , was altogether natural and satisfactory to the dealer . The majority of the dealers will not , of course , settle with the artists until they themselves are paid . This seems fair ; but , as things are , dealers often give very long credits for works sold , to please their clients , and , while they can afford this , the artist waits and waits . There is a peculiar attitude about the purchasing of works of art . I have heard an average collector say that he expected two years ' credit if he bought anything . This man probably never realized that ho was keeping the artist waiting for two years . There is something in the art-dealing business , an clement of gambling , which can convert an ordinary business man into a potential inmate of a jail sooner than almost any other occupation . Dealers as a rule adopt toward the artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the hand of the County Council visitor or Charity Organization Inspector . He is just a poor devil who would starve if not for them . Perhaps he would . To bend one 's energy to the creation of work , and to ma:ze one 's living at the same time , is beyond the power of the average artist . The artist has not only the dealer to contend with . Ho has also the art critic , art patron , and art director , or keeper of galleries and art institutions of all kinds . Take the art critic first . He is often a journalist who has accidentally taken up the function of critic of exhibitions , or an unsuccessful artist , one who found he could make an easier living by writing than by painting . His pen is dipped in gall and venom . He gets back at those artists who have persevered and still keep on working . He knows how to write as if he could do the thing himself , and achieves sometimes a tremendous reputation as a know-all in art , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schoolof such critics in all countries . In the field of Old Masters , they are the experts who command thousands of pounds a year for their services to great dealers . With modern work in their hands , their pens ate also for sale to the dealers . On one occasion when my friend Matthew Smith was holding an exhibition , I remarked on one critic 's praise , knowing that that same critic had often written disparagingly of Matthew Smith 's work . I said , ' How strange this new view is . ' The dealer merely remarked that with regard to this critic they had loaded the dice . ' In any other occupation or trade on earth this would be considered libelous or damaging . Not so with the artist . Hit hint and hit him hard . If he shows the slightest sign of originality , close the doors of the academies against him . Rob him . Drive him out of his profession . Taxation is another enemy of the artist . He is taxed on his work , which is his principal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it were , in gold and can not get it all repaid . The cost of producing a work of sculpture is left out of account when it comes to the price of even the smallest work . If it is in clay , there is first the clay model to be made and then cast into plaster ; then the bronze casting , which is costly . In stone , there is the material to be bought , and the carving takes a long time . Yet artists are considered lucky beggars . ' Perhaps they are . The uncertainty in which artists live with regard to their incomes makes them into Micawbers , who are always expecting something to turn up . If they are accused of extravagance , this only argues the inherent hopefulness in the artist 's nature . The artist is the world 's scapegoat . He has a reputation for profligacy in living . One critic wrote that Gauguin could not possibly make fine works as he had had illegitimate children in Tahiti . Did not Stephen Crane say that , if an artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is immediately called from the house- tops , ' Look at Jones , the artist . What a drunkard ! ' Was not Itembrandt a terrible drunkard ? Look at his portraits of himself , It is said that he has condemned himself out of his own self-portraits alone . Degas said that to make a fine work of art was similar to committing a crime ? u cryptic saying from a master , a saying with wide implications . Toulouse-Lautrec is an artist with a reputation for debauchery . Yet look at his drawings and paintings , and where do you see the results of debauchery ? There is nothing loose , careless , or feeble in them . The drawing is sensitive and tense ; the compositions are thought out , the work of a great artist with acute observation . Of an exhibition of portraits of my daughter Peggy-Jean , aged two to four years , a well-known writer-critic said , ' Even the soul of a child is not safe in his hands , ' and another newspaper man professed to discover that I had done a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could have written this filthy stuff , and why , I was told that it was that newspaper 's ' crime expert . ' Dealers , critics , patrons , artists ? a host of enemies waiting for the man of talent . II I have always been attracted by children as models for plastic work . I feel that the life of children has hardly been touched upon in sculpture , and this representation is avoided perhaps because of the difficulties which confront an artist who sets out to present a child . For one thing , the child can not sit still , and to compel a child to be quiet is to destroy at once the spontaneity and charm which lie in its frank and natural expressions . Yet I have attempted time after time this most difficult subject for sculpture . In Joan Greenwood there is the precocious child with elfin smile , and in portraits of Peggy-Jean . I made many studies , Peggy-Jean ' Laughing Studies ' and Peggy-Joan ' Sleeping Studies . ' Lately I have indulged my fancy for this expression in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jackie and others in bronze , and drawings , of which I have made a whole series of endless moods and variety of movement . Here again I have not restrained myself , but freely given what I have observed and felt , and I know that I have by no means exhausted the subject . The Florentines had a special love of children ? from Donatello 's mad incarnations of robust vitality , to graceful Verrocchio 's , to the waywardness of a Dasiderio da Settignano . To work from a child the sculptor has to have endless patience . He must wait and observe , and observe and wait . The small forms , so seemingly simple , are in reality so subtle , and the hunting of the form is an occupation that is at once tantalizing and fascinating . At the end of an hour or two , the nerves of an artist are torn to shreds , and neurasthenia and eye strain might well result from a too-prolonged preoccupation with this form of sculptural expression . The ' Babe ' confronts time and his destiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , as if in self-protection . He boldly and trustingly looks out upon a world newly born to his vision . This is a man-child , and his sturdy frame is like that of an Egyptian Icing in its compact lines . Every form is full , complete , and with a sense of new , fresh power . This man-child confronts a world which we older ones know only too well , and our gray , haggard glance must light up at this fresh revelation ? an undying ( lame of life embodied again . To have a child to work from was delightful . Little Peggy-Jean was a real source of inspiration . I never tired of watching her , and to watch her was for me to work from her ? to make studies in clay of all her moods ; and when she tired and fell asleep , there was something now to do , charming and complete . To work from a child seemed to me the only work worth doing , and I was prepared to go on for the rest of my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I exhibited these later in one of my exhibitions , and the reactions of some persons were far from amusing . Of the ' Peggy-Jean Asleep , ' one kind soul said , ' How cruel of Mr. Epstein to compel a child to pose like that . ' Others said , ' She is not at all a pretty child , ' as if it were the sole business of the artist to find a ' pretty ' child to work from . I regret that I have not done more children , and I plan some day to do only children . I think I should be quite content with that , and not bother about the grownups at all . I should love to till my studio with studies of children . Children just born . Children growing up . Children nude . Children in fantastic costumes en prince , with pets of all kinds , and toys . Dark children , pickaninnies , Chinese , Mongolian-eyed children . This is a fancy , a dream of mine ; but naturally I must sometimes turn to and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much in strange and unrealizable longings and desires . I begin the drawings of Jackie , and at first my drawings are somewhat sketchy , loose ; although from the beginning I know what I want to render . It is the life , I.- careless and apprehensive at the s bile , of the little boy with his lively . igence and quick ways , especially his eyes , and also his expressive hands in their infinite and unconscious gestures , that I wish to capture . I find that I must have great patience , as there is no such thing as posing ; I have to watch for the return of a gesture and the movement of the head . The same movement of the arms or hands never seems to recur , and I often rise after an hour or two , enervated and discouraged , with nothing to show but an abandoned beginning . Gradually I seem to gain in swiftness and assurance , and the drawings become more satisfactory . I reject a dozen drawings , and one seems to me to have got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him read to , and that fixes his attention . The stories with pictures hold him , especially drawings of animals ? Rabier 's graphic accounts above all . At the adventures of the monkey , the rabbit , the hedgehog , and the ducks , he roars with delight , and I then work with devoted fury . In time I see hundreds of things to do , all different . The drawings are like preludes and fugues , or , to put it better , variations on a theme ? the theme of young child life . An endless series of variations . I can see no monotony in my studies of this boy , although that is the easiest and readiest criticism . Today , variety means something different from what it once did . To me the changes of expression in a child 's head , the change of the direction of the pupil of the eye , the contraction and expansion of the eye , the change in nostrils and cheeks , give great variety , such variety as it would take a highly sensitive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's command , transcending mere styhism . The aim must be achieved , whatever the means . As I say , I work with fury and appetite , and before the miracle of the child 's moods I am almost nonplused ; but a partial achievement spurs me on , and with the multiplicity of drawings I feel the abundant harvest has made my efforts well worth while . I look upon this body of drawings of a child as a legacy well worth achieving . In reviewing them now , I see a development in technique and a final mastery , also great variety of line and rendering of form , through light and shade . I compare these drawings with any others I have made , and am pleased at their lightness and solidity . I feel really sorry that I have sold a number , as I should like to have kept them intact as a collection . My drawings of Jackie present a period of my life , and mark out a plastic expression I am proud of . To capture the fugitive and endless expressions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare experience . III With Rodin a new era in sculpture began ; and , though every schoolboy now seems able to pick holes in him , he was a revivifying force that compelled sculpture into paths which it is still following . Before Rodin ? with Houdon , Rude , Carpeaux ? the form , solely realistic and decorative , remained in itself uninteresting . With Rodin , modeling became interesting and individual for its own sake ; an clement of imagination entered sculpture which included the grotesque . Rodin was a sculptor who , in his search for expression , was not afraid to be grotesque and , in one or two instances , even ridiculous , which of course no living sculptor could ever afford to be . I find Rodin now much underrated , and the wiseacres of today will only admit that his drawings have the stuff of immortality in them . This is an absurd judgment , and we need only wait a few years for the pendulum to swing the other way . For one thing , the vast output of Rodin makes his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today makes one work , Rodin made a hundred , and his own fecundity tiros and bewilders us all in such a collection of his works as the 116tel BirOn possesses . I find that a sculptor who is much lauded today , Despiau , really has his foundation in Rodin . Actually Despiau worked for Rodin , carving marble for him . I could point to a head in the Rodin Mus6e which contains the whole of Despiau , and to mo Despiau 's work is monotonous and often insensitive . He is very popular , more especially in America , where works of an msthetic , or washed-out , character have a great vogue ? for example , Whistler , Marie Laurencin , ' abstract art , ' Brancusi . His nudes amount to school works which any clover student can produce . To compare this quite talented but limited sculptor with Rodin is nonsense . Rodin did not possess a sense of the architectural , and that is why his Porte d'En for ' is such a failure architecturally . From even a little distance it has all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the individual groups and figures , and the ' Porte d'Enfcr , ' to be appreciated , must be studied close to , when the tragic and splendid qualities of the groups reveal themselves . When I was a student in Paris , I was taken to Rodin 's studio by a fellow student , an Englishman . One afternoon we went together to the Rue de l'UniversitO , where Rodin had several studios adjoining one another , given him by the State . I saw there the large Victor Hugo in marble , still unfinished , and many smaller works in marble and bronze . One large low table was laden with hundreds of small studies and sketches brought , I should say , by aspiring sculptors and ' mothers of genius ' for Rodin 's inspection . How anyone had the impudence to impose on him in this fashion is incomprehensible to me . Rodin himself , short , bearded , with a sort of round flat cap on his head , looked calm and watchful at the same time . His neck was of enormous thickness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about among his guests , and he would roll tissue paper around a small bronze head and show it in that way . I did not speak to him , as I had only just arrived in Paris and knew no French . I was quite content to look at things , and watch Rodin himself . A sculptor totally unknown in England , and to the rest of Europe , is the American , George Grey Barnard . I knew his work in America and thought his first largo work , ' The Two Natures , ' now in the Metropolitan , a very great work in sculpture . It is one of the finest conceptions of our day . He spent a long life devoted to sculpture and was ' a law unto himself , ' going his own way . His statue of Lincoln , which was offered to London in 1017 , was most unfairly and bitterly assailed by a stupid art critic , Sir Claude Phillips . I answered this on October 6 , 1017 , defending Barnard 's ' Lincoln ' as a great work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , I read with astonishment the pontifical judgments of your art critic , Sir Claude Phillips , upon the statue of Abraham Lincoln by George Grey Barnard , the American sculptor , based solely upon what he admitted was a very blurred photograph ; and he is equally astonishing to me when he is full of respect and solemnity towards his own suggestions of what a monument to Lincoln should be . These two attitudes are by no means uncommon to critics . George Grey Barnard is a very great sculptor , an artist whose achievement is so superb that his statue of Lincoln should be awaited with the eager expectancy due to a new unknown work by a great master . What there may be behind this by no means accidental attack and Press campaign against the Lincoln statue I do not know , but undoubtedly Barnard , like all men of genius , and of independent mind , would have ready waiting for him the usual pack , who at the first opportunity would fasten upon him . I raise the only protest I know of against this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works for which we will always be grateful , and the attack on his statue of Lincoln in England is manifestly unfair and one-sided . In sculpture , although I had my first lessons from Barnard , we were poles apart in conception and execution . Barnard had a passion for the heroic , derived from an intensive study of Michelangelo , and I believe in all his thoughts and actions ho had Michelangelo somewhere in the background . He even boasted of having made more figures and groups of heroic size than the great Florentine himself . To my mind ho never achieved the intimate and personal which so appeals to me . On my return to America I was surprised to find that Barnard 's reputation had sunk very low , and mere tyros thought him academic and spoke scornfully of him . Brancusi is perhaps , of all modern sculptors , the man who brought the greatest individual touch into sculpture ; and he now has his imitators and followers by the hundreds . Indeed , his formula ? for a formula it became ? is used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was strongly influenced by Negro art , and also by Cycladic sculpture ; but in our own period of tortured and realistic work his highly sophisticated art seems fresh and strange ? a paradox . Brancusi himself , when I first met him , I found charming and simple in manner , and in appearance like a sailor or a farmer . Ile was deeply serious but with plenty of humor . We sat on a log , the only seat in his studio in Montparnasse , and he offered his guests sweets out of a paper bag . He was fond of telling funny stories about his sculpture . He had carved a bird and someone asked him why he had not done the feet of the bird . His answer was that ' the bird 's feet were in water and could not be seen . ' Ortiz de Zarate said humorously that whenever Easter came round he was reminded of Brancusi by the eggs . This referred to the fact that a good deal of Brancusi 's work took naturally an egg shape . Twenty years later I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine it to be the first visit : the work was the same , Brancusi was the same , somewhat grayer and thinner . Instead of drinking sour milk he now drank hot water : he said that hot water cured one of all ills , even of love . As I was saying good-bye to him in the courtyard , a French artist passed with the inevitable girl , going into their studio . We exchanged glances , and Brancusi turned to his studio with its abstract and arid sha pes . IV In my portraits it is assumed that I start out with a definite conception of my sitter 's character . On the contrary , I have no such conception whatever in the beginning . The sitter arrives in the stu- dio , mounts the stand , and I begin my study . My aim , to start with , is entirely constructive . With scientific precision I make a quite coldly thought-out construction of the form , giving the bony formations around t he eyes , the ridge of I he nose , mouth , and cheekbones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skull to each other . As the work proceeds I note the expression and the changes of expression , and the character of the model begins to impress itself on mo . In the end , by a natural process of observation , the mental and physiological characteristics of the sitter impose themselves upon the clay . This process is natural and not preconceived . With close and intensive study come subtleties and fine shades . From turning the work round so as to catch every light comes that solidity that makes the work lightproof , as it were . For in a work of sculpture the forms actually alter with the change of light , not as in a painting or drawing , where the forms only become more or less visible . It is said that the sculptor as an artist always depicts himself in his work , even in his portraits . In only one sense is this true ? that is , in the sense in which the artist 's own nature colors his outlook . To illustrate what I say , take a portrait by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is cold and detached ; he observes his models without any emotions and never warms to them . He seemed unfortunate in his sitters ; as human beings they evidently aroused in him no feeling of sympa thy , and he turned to their clothes with greater pleasure than he got from their faces . He obviously enjoyed his own technique and reveled in his marvelous skill . With Rembrandt the opposite seems the case . His great heart seemed to warm toward the men and women who sat for him , and he seemed to penetrate into their inner selves and reveal their very souls  --  in children their lively joy , and in grownups the burden of living , their sorrow and disappointments . There is a great wisdom in him , and his people look out of his canvases , human beings whose trades and business you can not tell , but they have deep human thoughts ; they are not just tradesmen and shrews , as in Hals . A beggar in the hands of Rembrandt is some ancient philosopher , a Diogenes content in his tub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the East with splendor wreathing him round . So with the portraits of Goya . His men are witty , cynical , brutal , and his women lovely , gallant , and lecherous . Rarely have I found sitters altogether pleased with their portraits . Understanding is rare , and the sitter usually wants to be flattered . How Goya ever got away with his superb portraits of the Spanish Royal Family is still an inexplicable mystery . I recall the na ? ve expression of one of my sitters who asked me if his nose was as I depicted it , and , when I assured him that it was so , cajolingly exclaimed , ' Ca n't you cheat nature a little ? ' Another will feel the bump at the back of his neck and look ruefully at my bust . On the whole , men sitters are more vain than women sitters . Shaw was terribly nervous about his bust ; so was Priestley ; and I have found that rarely does a wife see eye to eye with the artist . Always the artist ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in something that she has never observed . ' My best portraits , of course , have been those of friends and people I have asked to sit for me . The model who just sits and leaves the artist to his own thoughts is the most helpful one ? not the model who imagines she is inspiring the artist . It seems to me that Mona Lisa said nothing ; that ' enigmatic ' smile was quite enough for Leonardo to bother about . Sometimes the sitter impresses his own conception of himself upon the artist . This can never result in a successful work ? one that renders the character of the model . Sir Hugh Walpole was one of these sitters . He insisted on sitting to me like a Pharaoh , with head held high and chin stuck out . In reality Sir Hugh is the most genial of men , with sparkling , twinkling humor in his eye , and his mouth wreathed in a kindly , genial smile . But with the rigidity of Sir Hugh 's pose I could do nothing . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a portrait of my model 's real self , I never thought it was that for G moment . It was Sir Hugh Walpole in the role of Benito Mussolini . Muirhead Bone had arranged that I should do a bust of Conrad for him . I had desired ten years before to work from him , and had spoken to Richard Carle about it . I had been informed by him that Conrad could not sit for me , owing to the intervention of a painter ' friend . ' At the time I was deeply disappointed and dropped the idea . But in 1924 the commission was finally arranged . My admiration for Conrad was immense , and he had a head that appealed to a sculptor , massive and fine at the same time , so I jumped at the idea of working from him at last . After a meeting in London it was arranged with him that I should go down to his place at St. Oswalds , near Canterbury , and at my suggestion I should live in an inn in a near-by village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me best , as I prefer to be free outside my working hours . I set out from London on a cold March morning , feeling somewhat ill and downhearted . I hated working away from my studio , amidst uncertain and perhaps disagreeable conditions . Before beginning a work I am timid and apprehensive . What will the lighting be ? A good start is everything ; and with a subject like Conrad I wanted to do justice to myself . My taxi contained my working materials , stands , clay , and working tools . It seemed a long journey to Kent . I arrived toward dark with snow falling . Conrad met me , and we arranged the room in which I should work , where I un packed my baggage . I was then conducted across a park to the village of Bridge and the inn where I was to stay This inn seemed to be of the gloomiest and coldest type . The whole mood of the place , with the sodden countryside , promised a cheerless beginning . Conrad was an absorbing study . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one o'clock , when we lunched and talked . From the beginning he called me ' Cher Maitre , ' embarrassing me by this mode of address from a much older man who was a great master of his own craft . His manners were courtly and direct , but his neurasthenia forced him at times to outbursts of rage and irritability with his household , which quickly subsided . I already had a fairly clear notion as to how I should treat the bust . A sculptor had previously made a bust of him which represented him as an open-necked , romantic , out-of-door type of person . In appearance he was the very opposite . His clothes were immaculately conventional , and his collar enclosed his neck like an Iron Maiden 's vise or a garroter 's grip . He was worried if his hair and beard were not trim and neat as became a sea captain . There was nothing shaggy or bohemian about him . His glance was keen despite the drooping of one eyelid . He was the sea captain , the officer , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Responsibility weighed on him , weighed him down . He used the word again and again , and one immediately thought of Lord Jim ? the conscience suffering at the evasion of duty . It may have been because I met him late in life that Conrad gave me a feeling of defeat ? but defeat met with courage . He was crippled with rheumatism , crotchety , nervous , and ill . He said to me , ' I am finished . ' There was pathos in his pulling out of a drawer his last manuscript to show me that he was still at work . There was no triumph in his manner , however ; and he said that he did not know whether he would ever finish it . ' I am played out , ' he said ; played out . ' We talked after the sittings , mostly in the afternoons when we had tea together , and Conrad was full of reminiscences about himself . We were generally alone together . There in his country house he seemed to live alone , although the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week-ends , but he seemed a lonely , brooding man , with none too pleasant t houghts . Ile was a good sitter , always strictly punctual , and he stuck to the stand , giving me plenty of opportunity for work and study . I was with him for twenty-one days . Once , while posing , he had a heart attack , and he felt faint . His manservant . brought him a stiff whiskey , and he insisted on renewing t he sitting . I had no hesitations while at work , owing to his very sympathetic attitude . A doubtful or critical attitude of the sitter will sometimes hang like a dark cloud over the work and retard it . Conrad 's sympathy and good will were manifest . Ho would beam at me with a pleased expression and forget his rheumatism and the tree outside the window at which he railed . The tree was large and beautiful , but to Conrad it was a source of misery . The house was roomy , and set among low hills . To Conrad it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He must find another house . He would set out in his car , one step from the door to the sealed vehicle , to search for the new house . No outdoors for him . The sea captain hated out-of-doors , and never put his nose into it . To return to the bust ; Conrad had a demon expression in the left eye , while his right eye was smothered by a drooping lid , but the eyes glowed with a great intensity of feeling . The drooping , weary lids intensified the impression of brooding thought . The whole head revealed the man who had suffered much ? head set on shoulders hunched about his ears . When he was seated , the shoulders gave the impression of it pedestal for the head . His gnarled hands were covered with woolen mittens , and his habit of tugging at his beard when in conversation or in thought gave me the idea of Including the hands in the bust ; but he recoiled from so human a document . On anything connected with the plastic arts , Conrad frankly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to draw it parallel between the process of building up it work of sculpture and that of writing a novel . Of music he said he knew nothing , nor did it interest him ; but he admitted being impressed by the sound of drums coming across the waters in Africa at night . The walls of his house carried a few indifferent family portraits in oil . He turned over lovingly the family portrait album of his ancestors : his father , a distinguished Polish nobleman named Korzeniowski , who had suffered under the Czar ; photographs of himself very young , which showed him as being extremely handsome . I looked at Conrad 's bookshelf . He had not many hooks , in no sense it library ; but he had it complete edition of Turgenev in English . We talked of books , and I mentioned Melville 's Moby Dick , expecting him to be interested . Conrad burst into a furious denunciation of it .. ' He knows nothing of the sea . It 's fantastic , ridiculous , ' he said . When I mentioned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my eye . My old boots are mystical . ' Meredith ? His characters are ten feet high . D. H. Lawrence had started well , but had gone wrong . ' Filth . Nothing bait obscenities . ' For Henry James he had unqualified admiration . Of his own novels he said it was it tossup at one time as to whether he would write in English or in French . He emphasized the amount of labor he gave to a novel to get it to satisfy himself . At it few of the sittings Conrad dictated letters to the secretary . His English was strongly foreign , with is very guttural accent , so that his secretary frequently failed to get the right word , which made Conrad growl . I would try to detach myself from the work to listen . His composition was beautiful . Sentence followed sentence in classic ' Conrad , ' totally unlike his conversational manlier , which was free , easy , and colloquial . The work on the bust was nearing completion . One day , at the end of the sittings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She gave one glance and fled . Perhaps a wife , a lover , can never see what the artist sees . At any rate , the fact is that they rarely ever do . Perhaps a really mediocre artist has more chance of success in this respect . When George Bernard Shaw was sitting to me I asked him why he had given sittings to a very incompetent artist . Shaw exclaimed : ' Why , he is a fine portrait painter ? my wife , on entering the room where the portrait was , actually mistook it for myself . ' Conrad 's own opinion about my portrait of himself was conveyed in a letter he wrote to Richard Curle , his biographer and literary executor . ' The bust of Ep has grown truly monumental . It is a marvelously effective piece of sculpture , with even something more than a masterly interpretation in it . It is wonderful to go clown to posterity like that .

I said goodbye to the old Master and traveled with the bust . Five months later I opened a newspaper and read that Joseph Conrad was dead . V In 1933 rumors of the intended assassination of Einstein caused his flight to England . He left Belgium and was a refugee under Commander LockerLampson 's care at a camp near Crouton I had some correspondence with Commander Locker-Lampson about myworking from Einstein , and we arranged for a week of sittings . I traveled to Cromer , and the following morning was driven out to the camp , situated in a secluded wild spot very near the sea . Einstein appeared , dressed very comfortably in a pullover with his wild hair floating in the wind . His glance contained a mixture of the humane , the humorous , and the profound . This was a combination which delighted me . He resembled the aging Rembrandt . The sittings took place in a small hut , which was filled with a piano so that I could hardly turn round . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several , secretaries of Commander LockerLampson , to remove the door , which they did ; but they facetiously asked whether I would like the roof off next . I thought I should have liked that too , but I did not demand it , as the attendant ' angels ' seemed to resent a little my intrusion into the retreat of their Professor . After the third day they thawed , and I was offered beer at the end of the sitting . I worked for two hours every morning , and at the first sitting the Professor was so surrounded with tobacco smoke from his pipe that I saw nothing . At the second sitting I asked him to smoke in the interval . Einstein 's manner was full of charm and bonhomie . Ile enjoyed a joke and had many a jibe at the Nazi professors , one hundred of whom in a book had condemned his theory . Were I wrong , ' he said , one professor would have been quite enough . ' Also , in speaking of Nazis , he once said , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about being non-Aryan until Hitler made me conscious of it . ' At the end of the sittings he would sit down at the piano and play , and once he took a violin and went outside and scraped away . He looked altogether like a wandering gypsy , but the sea air was damp , the violin execrable , and he gave it up . The Nazis had taken his own good violin when they confiscated his property in Germany . Einstein watched my work with a kind of naive wonder and seemed to sense that I was doing something good of him . The sittings unfortunately had to come to a close , as Einstein was to go up to London to make a speech at the Albert Hall and then leave for America . I could have gone on with the work . It seemed to me a good start , hut , as so often happens , tlse work had to be stopped before I had carried it to completion . Later I exhibited the head in London in December 1933 . During the exhibition , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was discovered on the floor , fortunately only bent on to its stone pedestal , which could easily be remedied . Who had overthrown it ? This version was bought by the Chantry bequest , and is at present its the Tate Gallery . I met Lord Rothermere on the Aquitania on my return from New York in January 1028 . He asked me if I would do his bust in London . Of this meeting with Rothermere on the Aquilania I recall a dinner which he gave onboard , at which the great steel magnate , Charles Schwab , and P. G. Wodehouse , the English humorist , were present . Lord Rothermere asked Schwab how much he thought Isis fortune amounted to , and Schwab answered very impressively that he ' toally could n't compute it . ' I was , of course , referred to as the ' greatest ' sculptor in the world , and in the eyes of these moneyed men that meant the sculptor who made the most money . Wodehouse discussed stocks and shares , and altogether I got a strange impression of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of how they are interested in wealth , which to an artist is only a means to finer ends . Lord Rothermere , although he prided himself upon owning a fine collection of Old Masters , answered when I asked him what Rembrandts he possessed , But Rembrandt is n't any good , is he ? ' The sittings in London for the bust characteristically began with a film corn pany 's making a film of myself and the sitter at work . Altogether the proceedings went on , as it were , in public , as Rothermere liked company and conducted Isis various businesses in my studio . I did not mind this , as it showed the sitter animated by subjects that really interested him . I have long ago been forced into the habit of ignoring those around me when at work and thinking only of the world in hand . Financiers and millions of pounds were discussed . Rothermere was monumental and offered strange psychological problems to the artist . Also , he possessed a natural sense of humor and did not expect me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making an Ivor Novello of him . The work progressed , but my model had a disconcerting habit of leaving for foreign parts suddenly and sending mo a wire that he would turn up in about a week or fortnight and join me in the clay bin , ' as he put it . This habit of the wire finally decided me to call it a day , and the bust was declared finished . Rothermere pretended to no knowledge of modern art , but collected Old Masters . I will say that when he showed me these I was not very much impressed . A critic had collected them for him . This critic let me see that he was eager that I should not show him up too much to Lord Rothermere over the pictures . On the occasion when the collection was shown to me , one evening at dinner at Lord Rothermere 's at Sunningdale , the critic waylaid me previously and made a personal appeal to me not to criticize the pictures to Lord Rothermere . To my amusement , he added that Lord Rothermere could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us ' made me laugh . ' Ilse occasion of this dinner was the placing of Rothermere 's bust in the Sunningdale house , which took place five years after I had finished the work . Rothermere had apparently forgotten the bust for that period . This bust , with its somewhat formidable character , seemed to have to be handled carefully , for when I had proposed exhibiting it on sonic previous occasion I was advised not to do so , as a General Election was coming on and it might possibly exert sonic baneful influence on events . Lord Rot hermere 's secretaries seemed particularly upset by the work . This I take as tribute to the sincerity and truth of the rendering of the character . What these ' yes men ' expected me to do , 1 do not quite know ; but their hostility was expressed quite frankly . I think of it as one of my best portraits . Shaw sat on condition that I was commissioned to do the work . He thought I ought to benefit materially and not just do his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me from Mrs. Blanche Grant , an American . Shaw sat with exemplary patience and even eagerness . He walked to my studio every day , and was punctual and conscientious . He wisecracked , of course . In matters of art he aired definite opinions , mostly wrong ; and I often had to believe that he wished to say smart , clever things to amuse me . On seeing a huge block of stone , unworked , in the studio , he asked me what I intended to do with it . Not wishing to tell him exactly what my plans were , I merely remarked that I had a plan . ' What ! ' he exclaimed . ' You have a plan ? You should n't have a plan . I never work according to a plan . Each day I begin with new ideas totally different from the day before . ' As if a sculptor with a six-ton block to carve could alter his idea daily ! Shaw believed that sculptors put into their portraits their own characteristics , and of a bust done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something very aristocratic . This was amusing in view of the fact that this particular bust was peculiarly commonplace . One day Robert Flaherty brought along the Aran boatman , Tiger King , who was the chief character in the film , Man of Aran , written about fishermen . In the studio , when Tiger King was introduced , Shaw immediately started talking to him on how to sail a boat , what happened in storms , and generally instructed him in sea lore , Shaw was puzzled by the bust of himself and often looked at it and tried to make it out . He believed that I had made a kind of primitive barbarian of him , something altogether uncivilized and really a projection of myself , rather than of him . I never tried to explain the bust to him , and I think that there are in it , elements so subtle that they would be difficult to explain . Nevertheless , I believe this to be an authentic and faithful rendering of George Bernard Shaw physically and psychologically . I leave out any question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehension . When the bust was finished , we were filmed ; and Shaw was wonderful as an actor , taking the filming very seriously . In 1934 , when the work in bronze was done , I offered Shaw a copy of the bust through Orage , but was told that Shaw could not think of having it in his house . This I believe was because of Mrs. Shaw 's dislike of it . Throughout my life in England , Shaw has been an outspoken champion of my work , on several occasions giving the great British public lively smacks on my behalf . I will not say that he understands what I have made . He seems deficient in all sense of the plastic , but has a lively notion of how stupid the newspapers can be . He is generous to young talent , but seems likely to be taken in by cleverness or pretense . I would say that Shaw is not really interested in the plastic arts , although he can be got to take a passing or journalistic interest in controversial work . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Epping Forest , not knowing what to say , he asked me if I had done the paintings with brushes .
