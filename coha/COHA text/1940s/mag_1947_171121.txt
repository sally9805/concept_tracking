For weeks Pern had been maneuvering his flyswatter nearer &; nearer the gadfly Socialist weekly La Vanguardia . First he closed Vanguardia 's B.A. plant , on the deadpan excuse that it violated municipal ordinances ( TIME , Sept. 8 ) . Since then the Socialists have skipped from one secret printing plant to another , sometimes publishing on wrapping paper , but always publishing . Last week Pern seemed to have the swatter poised ; a new decree required each paper to carry its printer 's name and address on penalty of confiscation of the issue . <P> The big commercial dailies also felt the threat of a swat . For four months , newsprint imports had been banned . Now the Government was letting paper in if buyers surrendered part of it for resale to the noisy pro-Pern press . Staunchly independent La Prensa , desperate for newsprint , was asked to give up half its incoming shipments ; the more tractable El Mundo chain ( one newspaper , six magazines , a radio station ) could keep 70% . The warning to the press was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> No one could fairly compare Pern 's Argentina to a European police state . Socialists , even Communists , could stage street-corner meetings and shout bitterly against the Government , if they dared the stones of exuberant Pernistas . But the press throttle was ominous , even though Pernistas , who blandly assert that the press is free , could point to La Prensa 's reprinting excerpts from last week 's warning by the New York Times : " This is the classic first step by which dictatorship is imposed upon a people . By its very nature , dictatorship moves inexorably to stifle the voice of a free press and to destroy the sources of trustworthy information . . . . In following in this respect the pattern endorsed by Stalin and Hitler , Mussolini and Franco , Seor Pern has embarked on a course of infinite danger to his country . "
