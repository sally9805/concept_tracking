In 1937 a roly-poly , rubicund Anglican vicar named R. Anderson Jardine felt an urgent spiritual call . In defiance of the Archbishop of Canterbury he married the Duke of Windsor and Mrs. Wallis Warfield . Later he turned up in Hollywood , earned a living by marrying romantic couples who wanted to be wed by the man who had married the Duke and Wally . <P> Six months ago Rev. R. Anderson Jardine had another call . This time it was up to him to save the U. S. from salacious magazines and other vile literature . He started to write a book - Wake Up Amer ica to Indecency . A friend thought it was just the thing for a movie . Four anonymous backers put up $100,000 for the production . A script was prepared , and the title stripped down to plain Indecency . <P> Indecency 's plot is rather simple , though obviously not everybody would have thought of it . Villain is a publisher of filthy literature . Hero is Crusader Britton ( Rev. R. Anderson Jardine ) . The publisher is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) a bad girl . The bad girl has a child by the publisher just as he is about to marry the good girl at a swanky church wedding . <P> Down the church aisle strides Crusader Britton , dragging the bad girl . She tells all . The good girl realizes what a viper the publisher is . The bad girl marries him anyhow - to give her child a name . The fade-out shows Crusader Britton pushing away a montage of salacious magazines . <P> Such a movie , thought Preacher Jardine , required a new type of heroine to play the good girl - a Miss Spiritual America . Said he : " First there was the It Girl , then the Glamor Girl , then the Oomph Girl , and now the Spiritual Girl . " Preacher Jardine set out to find the spiritual girl . <P> Soon he was finding spirituality in Phoenix , El Paso , Dallas , Atlanta , Miami . Nothing like it had been seen since the search for Scarlett O'Hara . Miss Spirituals " must have a spiritual look , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or drink , must go to church regularly . In addition , they must have a certain zip . Says Preacher Jardine : " I want to de-oomph the Oomph Girl . " <P> Last fortnight de-oomphing had got as far as Washington , D. C. For two days the vicar looked over dozens of spiritual girls . At last he picked Ellen Burton , 19 , big-eyed and brunette , to be Miss Spiritual Washington . True , the winner came from Alexandria , Va. , eight miles across the Potomac . But she had spirituality . <P> Said the vicar 's cameraman : " There is sorrow in her countenance . It lends her a spiritual look . " <P> Each of the municipal Miss Spirituals is promised a part in Indecency . One among them will be chosen Miss Spiritual America , and she will be the picture 's star . Last week it was still too early to guess which Miss Spiritual would be the heroine of Indecency , but there were indications that Preacher Jardine favored Miss Spiritual Miami .
