The Rev. Kenneth Macrae of Stornoway , Hebrides , was boiling mad . Mincing no words , he told the Edinburgh assembly of the fundamentalist Free Church of Scotland ( the " Wee Frees " ) that the church should break relations with the Y.M.C.A. The Y , he had discovered , was condoning modernist doctrines and " worldly amusements , " and had put out a scandalous booklet for servicemen . Told in the Huts . Without further ado , the shocked assembly passed the resolution . Next day , it learned that the objectionable booklet was about France and Gallipoli during World War I , and had been out of print for 25 years .
