 | AN AMERICAN housewife can hardly picture the daily lives of her sisters in Europe ? so new to world history is the war work of women today . For her this extraordinary " everyday " life of war-mobilizes : women has loomed dimly at bes-. shrouded by both distance and censorship . Newsreels , radio , and newspapers have told more of Europe soldiers than of its housewives arc : mothers .

But freeborn Britishtook it in their stride ; they were : : t on saving lives of women and : dren ? not historical principles . Until the women 's war began , four of five Englishmen lived in cities , erable to Nazi bombs . Three s later all cities were " officially red " of all boys and girls under teen . Thanks to evacuation dicrship , they were in farmhouses , rages , village shops , and ducal tes miles away . omen found these new billets , women set up in advance the ions of new beds . Women deiivthe millions of little refugees to railway stations , and mothered as they waited at the bus cenThe gigantic vanishing act was eived and ordered by a man , ter Elliott , Britain 's transportaand housing genius . But carrying this tremendous migration of ren remains the foremost feat female patience in modern times . e hundred thousand social workhad canvassed the countryside , rding every habitable room , loevery refuge ? from farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on barnestates. . ey had had only six weeks to do job . Then , in the first four days , en 's organizations marshaled .000 boys and girls from Engtarget cities " alone ? London , . ehester , Liverpool , etc. ? and them , by bus and train , into r improvised rural billets . Gov.ent rules were severe . Most mowers of refugees under five were commandeered as convoys , and themselves required , on forty-eight hours ' notice , to move to an unknown destination . All other parents were as firmly immobilized , not even told in which province their children would be staying . Every hasty effort had been made to choose appropriate quarters . Actually , there were too many paupers . Urchins from London 's Whitechapel slum were cast up , breathless and aghast , on millionaires ' estates , confronted by soap and water , suspiciously making their first acquaintance with sheets and modern plumbing . Kids from Manchester 's slum , Ancoats , found themselves housed , by scores , in a huge reception room in the country palace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nail to get away . Many of the youngest , frightened by the hooting of owls and the croak of bullfrogs , ran away , and tried to get back to London . Thousands had to be taught forcibly to play in the fields and forest , and stop their pavement games in village streets . The toughest formed gangs , and roamed the countryside like young wolves . One little boy in Sussex achieved brief national fame by writing home , after his first glimpse of a butler : " A policeman comes and takes our plates away after dinner . " Another young slum refugee parried hygiene requirement number one . " I just do n't want a new one , " he said , clutching his well-worn toothbrush . " This is a very special brush ; it belonged first to my uncle , and then my father . " A flat rate has been set for the " upkeep " of a boy or girl in the country : about $2.50 per week for the first child , another $2 for each additional child . The government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose parents ca n't afford it . Original regulations banned children and parents from writing to each other directly . The children sent form post cards , reporting that they were getting along all right and admonishing their parents not to worry ? without a return address . Mothers and fathers in turn wrote the government , and the letters were forwarded , Downing Street was deathly afraid that mother and father love , fed on youngsters ' plaints of homesickness , would turn the English countryside into one great child hunt , with millions of family reunions hopelessly snarling national-defense plans . They withheld addresses till the children could settle down . Such was the greatest regimentation , physical and spiritual , to which individualist Britishers had ever submitted . Not even Hitler has yet dared command anything like this harsh disruption of families . But women in cities found the scene profoundly changed in other ways besides the absence of their children ? cities wrapped in sandbags against air raids , thronged with horses and bicycles.for the first time in twenty years , dotted with airraid shelters looking like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The WAAC , the WAT , the WRAF , the WRN , the ARP , the Women 's Reserve , the Women 's Legion , the Women 's Transport Service , the Women 's Mechanized Transport Training Corps , the Women 's Voluntary Ambulance Service , the Civil Nursing Reserve ? all are uniformed , in khaki , white , or gray blue . This vast  | " Blouse and Skirt Army " sprang out of nowhere on the eve of the Czechoslovakian crisis , when death first threatened to rain from the skies . From a mere 2000 air-defense teachers put to work on November 6 , 1938 , one call for volunteers shot the Women 's Army instantly to 200 , - 000 on July 2 , 1939 . Today the women 's services in Britain include about half the female population . Their popular titles rival the New Deal alphabet in America . The " waacs " and the " wats " are the Women 's Auxiliary Army Corps and Women 's Auxiliary Territorials ( National Guard ) . Auxiliaries to navy and royal air force are similarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Into every branch have gone East End 2ockneys , peeresses and their deb daugh-ers , young mothers and typists , salesgirls nd movie actresses . Each division has a - pecial job . One runs the buses and deivery trucks . Another has set up firstaid stations within reach of every city corner and in every country village . Others monopolize the new arts of fire fighting and gas neutralizing after air raids . Another controls the entire airraid alarm system and the provisioning of community air-raid shelters . And 100,000 women are on day-andnight call in the nursing reserve . Genuine war work also falls to each division . For instance , the " wrens " handle for the navy all adjustment of gyro-compasses , priming of depth charges , manufacture of antisub nets , most mapmaking and blueprinting of guns . In the last war , women were found to surpass men as code experts and accountants , were given complete control of the Admiralty 's London radio room . The day war was declared , 50,000 " Land Girls " entrained for the country to help bring in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received a ration book ; even the King received one for himself and the Queen . Next day each housewife was paying threepence a pound for sugar , whether she lived in the port of London , in a mountain village in Scotland , or on the storm-tossed Orkney Islands ? the government had quickly , efficiently " equalized " transportation costs . When she went to the bakery , she found the shelves packed with the new regulation " oaten bread " ? milling of white flour wastes much of the grain . When she stopped for " fish and chips " ( English equivalent of the American hotdog ) , she found even the sacred institution had been mobilized : the fillet was full of bones . Preboning had been banned as waste of both food and manpower . By the time the last war ended , a full 80 percent of England 's work was being performed by women . Englishmen were so grateful that , hardly back from the trenches , they voted full woman suffrage ? for which their mothers and wives had campaigned in vain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged with far greater revolutionary potential . The shuffle of 8,000,000 lives involved in mass evacuation is the deepest social change to which England has been exposed since the Industrial Revolution . Bejeweled duchesses are learning that thousands of England 's children are verminous and at the age of twelve still not housebroken . Millions of youngsters are learning that tenements , filth , and disease are not inevitable accompaniments of existence ; just as it is bursting upon them that milk does not grow in bottles or fruit in market baskets . Tragedy looms , too . Thousands of children have run away , thousands have fallen into the hands of hard taskmasters , thousands are incorrigible and have driven their new hosts to assault and even to cases of suicide . Slum habits and slum obscenities are rousing hatred and disgust among the cleanly and moral country folk . Thousands of young mothers in exile find sharing a kitchen with a total stranger beyond the limit of nervous endurance . The problem of disease alone may wreck evacuation plans . The social snarl produced by England 's war migration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . Whether it will finally bind Britain together with strong new ties of brotherhood , or choke the land in a tangle of dislike and distrust , may make or break British morale enough to decide the outcome of the war . France , traditional home of temperament , began her mobilization of women for war with a calm orderliness that made the work of the British cabinet look hysterical . In dealing with their bomb-threatened children , Frenchmen considered politically the most radical people in West Europe ? were more conservative than the English : they held every family faithfully together instead of knocking it apart . France mobilized her women to do exactly the same jobs as Englishwomen , but without the haste or emotional strain of improvisation . Virtually since 1919 , the Parisian housewife has known what she would have to do when war was declared . For example , Madame Yvette G. is a well-to-do Frenchwoman , widowed and well educated . She spent most of July in New York seeing the World 's Fair , and intended to travel on to California to visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for steamship tickets instead . " I 'm sure war is about to break , " she said . " And I have a job driving a truck . If I go to California , I wo n't enjoy a minute of it , thinking nobody is ready there in Paris to handle my job . " In all the long-perfected plans for Total Defense , the French government has left ample scope for the famous individualism of its citizens ? just as in 1914-1918 " System D " became famous . " System D " originated as a phrase in the trenches , as an ironic commentary on the instruction sheets the government had issued on every subject ? from how to clean a gun to how to open a can of bully-beef . " D " was popularly added as the last instruction , and the most important : " And from here onward , use your own judgment , " or " From here , you 're on your own . " " System D " is still the main ingredient in the defense of France . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blanket orders , like those in England , to evacuate the " target cities . " But there were differences : all parents paying above a certain amount might choose where their children were to go . Families were kept informed of the whereabouts of evacuated members . Parents were required to settle their children in the country themselves ; mothers had to get a special permit not to accompany their youngsters . The French government fought to preserve the family group , as the backbone of the nation . As a result , evacuation in France was pervaded with a calm that was deceptively casual , in contrast to the near hysteria in Britain . However , the French government had to issue three frantic pleas in two weeks to get even the first 500,000 children out of Paris . Thrifty , coolheaded French housewives are still going gradually ? whenever they locate a place they can afford . In the same way , despite years of preparation , the first air-raid scares found tens of thousands of Parisians without gas masks . There was no excitement and little railing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugstore and bought bicarbonate of soda . For years they had heard , in air-defense lectures , that soda sprinkled on a moistened towel was a dependable makeshift . French housewives likewise were more reassured than worried when the postman thumped on the door with ration cards in his hand . For they knew their larders would be the best stocked of all the warring nations , no matter how long the conflict might last . France grows all its own wheat , maize , rice , potatoes , and sugar , while Britain can supply its needs only in milk and potatoes , and Germany is self-sufficient in potatoes alone . Throughout the last war , every French family received more to eat than any English housewife could get . Today scientific comparisons , quietly emphasized by all French newspapers , inform Frenchwomen that their 1940 ration is three times that with which German women are going into this war . The day the French housewife 's husband left for the front , a moratorium went into effect on her rent . The government also stepped in to pay gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certified she had no other means of support . Allowances were made at once for food and necessities . Eight great women 's organizations will swallow her up if she is single or childless . No mothers , in line with the national drive to preserve the family at all costs , are accepted in the ranks of the Women 's Services of France . Frenchwomen 's groups have uniforms like those across the Channel : long , grayblue , double-breasted jacket of military cut , cloth belt , a regulation skirt 13 ? inches from the ground , a forage cap loose in the rear to obviate military haircutting , and low , flat shoes . As is the case in England , silk stockings and lipstick are permitted as contributing to female  | morale , but high heels are banned as hazardous . The most distinguished of the eight women 's divisions is the Frenchwomen Decorated by the Legion of Honor . And their assignments , as members of cycle squadrons to carry vital messages , interpreters , blood donors , and teachers of civil defense , are considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Organizations mobilizes the evacuation of the nursing mothers , the sick , the old , the pregnant . The Mobile Nurses includes trained nurses familiar with either airplanes or automobiles . The Women 's Auxiliary Aeronautic Corps numbers thirty-five veteran women pilots and twenty crack engineers . But their main task is to train thousands of women mechanics to replace ground crews in the men 's aviation service . Courses in motors , radio , navigation , optics , and meteorology had graduated hundreds before the war began . The youngest pilot is fourteen years old , the daughter of a veteran of the Dardanelles . The Carriers of Heavy Freight are the huskiest women in France , chosen to shoulder literally the burden of delivering civilian food supplies when all other means break down . The Defense Passive , like the British Air Raid Precautions , includes almost every noncombatant in the population . Together with the lightning-fast women 's Fire and Gas Brigades , they take over a city and rush it underground the moment an air-raid siren sounds . But it is the Group of Parachute Nurses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and steals the women's-interest headlines . Composed of society sportswomen , Olympic stars , and dancers from the Folies Bergeres , who must be trained nurses as well as registered pilots , this group carries succor to wounded poilus stranded in inaccessible positions , even behind the German lines . Part of its publicity value is the auspicious nationality of its founder , France 's most colorful aviatrix , Suzette O'Neill-Dranem , who is the widow of a Pittsburgh newspaper publisher . Best England could do in the same line was ceremoniously to sign up an American as first recruit of the WATS ? U. S.-born Mrs. Jocelyn Corbett , now wife of an officer in the War Department . FRENCHWOMEN 'S wartime activities throughout the nation were typically displayed on September 2 . After a sleepless night seeing off husbands , brothers , sons , and sweethearts at the stations , few women in France were not red-eyed and haggard . Yet there they were , running subway cars , driving omnibuses , sitting behind windows at post offices and banks , running most of the stores that were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and presiding at the first soup kitchens drawn up in the public squares . White-haired women , in grayblue uniforms , knapsacks on their backs , briskly cycled through the streets , carrying orders from one female battalion headquarters to another . Calm and capable , the Frenchwoman 's motto was not even " Business As Usual , " but " Usual Business of War . " Even so she kept her famous temperament , and within a week the fashion-makers were rushing smartly styled gas masks on the market " to match your dress . " Hats had tiny guns and planes as decorations . Dresses were designed after historic uniforms , in colors entitled " cavalry brown , " " aviation blue , " and " colonial reds and tans . " In Germany , where they had been trained as yes-women for years , housewives with nerves worn thin by years of " unofficial war , " suddenly became mor stubborn than any others in Europe , i questioning the value of this conflict .

Most house wives had voted for Hitler in the election that brought him to power . But for tee full years the average hausfrau had nevi seen more than one egg at a time in he kitchen , had had to cheat and forge an " commit treason " to obtain a pound of butter .

Germany 's women had governmee support in the absence of their breadwie ners ? at a price . Every hausfrau ar mother has been impressed twenty-foe hours a day for three years into the n : tion 's service . At first women built an raid shelters , cut bandages , knit soldier socks . Soon they were sent overnight trainloads to the fields to assure the ha vests , since most farm boys were " some where under arms . " Thousands of " wt widows " had attempted to support theqq selves by part-time businesses , like rril stores and tobacco shops and newsstand Government orders closed these out , " nonessential to the Fatherland , " al sent their owners to work in arms inch ' tries ? side by side with thousands Czech laborers who could not yet spee German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " untapped n serves of feminine labor .

" You did all the work yourself , for , in 1938 , housemaids were the first group conscripted as factory hands . Last year 10,000 more German servant girls were called home from England . They did not go into Third Reich kitchens ; they were set to work concocting powder and poison gases .

All lemons , pepper , and onions ? favorite German seasoning ? disappeared from the market late in 1937 , as luxury imports . Official theory was that Germans would eat less if their food were unspiced . And now there is " real rationing , " and there is a " real war . " Of only one thing is there a full supply in Germany : potatoes . Children did not have sufficient milk , even as the war began . German youngsters under six years are strictly rationed to one large pint a day . ( American standards wean an infant on about a daily quart , or nearly twice as much . American babies who can not be nursed consume a full fifty percent more than that . ) Nursing mothers in Germany get a short pint a day . Children between six and fourteen have less than half a pint . Ordinary adults thus get no milk allowance ; with fats shortage the most crucial of all , even " drinking of fats " must stop .

According to his figures , the minimum requirement for normal human health is 2700 calories per day , while these Reich rations run from 2100 to 2400 . He rates it a little lower than the food allowance granted by the Kaiser to the inhabitants of Belgium from 1914 to 1918 . But though German children may be undernourished , and mothers anxious , they are at least side by side , if the government can in any way guarantee it . The family ? with wife subservient to husband , children subordinate to parents , and the father unquestioningly obedient to the government ? has always been the bedrock of German society .
