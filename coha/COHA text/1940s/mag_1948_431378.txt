 | GALILEO-Bold Discoverer By Donald Culross Peattie YOU CAN still see , in the cathedral of Pisa , the lamp that lit the spark in one of the greatest geniuses who ever lived . Someone , that day in 1581 , had drawn the lamp aside to light it , then let it swing free on its chain . Quietly over the heads of the worshipers it swept in wide arcs that gradually grew shorter . And a 17-year-old boy forgot his prayers as he watched . Common sense would say that the pendulum would take longer to swing through a wide arc than a short one , but young Galileo Galilei perceived that it did not . He was exact about it : having no watch , he clocked the swings by his own pulse . And the beat of his heart told him that what he had felt in his bones was true . Young Galileo had caught a fragment of the harmonics of the uni- verse . Fired , he experimented at home with pendulums of every length and weight , hung from ceiling beams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exasperated . He invented a pendulum which could be made to synchronize with the human pulse and which registered its beat on a dial . So physicians , in days when watches were a rarity , could measure a patient 's pulse exactly . This boy , born February 18 , 1564 , in Pisa , was the son of Vincenzo Galilei , an impoverished nobleman with a marked gift for abstruse mathematics and a great love of music . But as higher mathematics was of no use in running the linen shop which this nobleman was forced , to his shame , to keep , he refused to let his eldest son have any-  | thing to do with " the useless science . ' In music Vincenzo found solace for his failures and his wife 's violent rages . So he himself taught the boy to play the lute and organ . From his mother young Galileo got a weakness for sarcasm and quick anger that was to bring him enemies . From his father the boy received the gift for mathematics . The Vallombrosan Fathers in a school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved the life of scholarship . At 13 , Galileo wrote home that he wished to enter holy orders . The elder Galilei , however , thought it was time the boy went to work . So into the linen shop went Galileo , where he failed dismally . Therefore , in 1581 , when he was 17 , his father sent him to the University of Pisa to study medicine instead . Preparation for that profession then included the study of Aristotle 's philosophy . Though he had been dead almost 2000 years , to question him was virtual heresy . The Church still insisted , moreover ? as Ptolemy the Greek had taught more than a thousand years before ? that the earth was the center of the universe , with a little moon and sun and some pinprick lights called stars revolving around it . Young Galileo , disgusted with this little universe and the little minds that upheld it , sought proofs instead of dogmas . Studying by himself , he discovered Archimedes , greatest of all Greek mathematicians and physicists . Presently the eager student invented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on an application of Archimedes ' theory . He worked out a simple method for determining the center of gravity in solids . His fame spread among scientists . In 1588 , aided by influential men who had noted his gifts , the 24-year-old Galileo received a professorship in mathematics at the University of Pisa . Once inside the academic walls , the young professor dared to refute Aristotle . Theorizing without experimenting , Aristotle had stated that the heavier the weight of a body , the faster it must fall . But Galileo summoned the learned faculty to the foot of the famous Leaning Tower and from the top pushed a ten-pound weight and a one-pound weight together . Both hit the pavement at the same instant . The professors , however , preferred to believe their books rather than their eyesight . Nonetheless , Galileo experimented further with freely falling bodies and bodies rolling down an inclined plane . He proved that not only do all bodies fall faster in each interval of time but that the increase in velocity is uniform . Today this principle is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pinpoint bombing . Of bombing from planes Galileo probably never dreamed , but he was fascinated by artillery fire . Gunners already knew they had to elevate their sights to hit a distant object , but they did it by guess . Galileo demonstrated that the path of a mis-  | site is a parabola , and built up a series of calculations that tell a gunner the elevation necessary to hit a target of known distance . Thus he founded the science of masses in motion ? which we today call dynamics . In the basic laws he laid down Galileo gave physics a new concept : inertia the tendency of all matter to stay at rest , or , if in motion , to continue at the same rate in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force . We call this " Newton 's first law " because the great Englishman gave it precise expression , but Galileo first explored its possibilities . First of all men , he saw that inertia applies to all bodies on earth or in the sky . Before Galileo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty of Pisa could n't or would n't adopt it , they intrigued to get the young experimenter out . Unfortunately , he had covered with sarcasm the pretentious harbordredging engine of the reigning Duke of Tuscany 's half brother . Worse still , Galileo had been right ; the costly invention broke down . Allying themselves with this influential fumbler , the professors got Galileo 's pay diminished . Resigning in disgust , he went back to the linen shop . Fortunately , Galileo 's friends were as numerous as his enemies , and through them the Republic of Venice summoned him in 1592 to teach in the University of Padua . The pay was good , and there was an atmosphere of intellectual freedom . For the next 18 years Galileo designed fortifications , siege machinery and bridges . He invented the ancestor of the slide rule for calculating interest , extracting square and cube root . To this was joined a quadrant for taking angles and getting divisions of the astronomical compass . His instrument was in such demand he had to hire assistants to help produce it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workmanship . At Padua , Galileo 's classes overflowed the largest hall . He had to lecture outdoors . Students flocked to him from as far off as Sweden and Scotland among them the future great who were to carry their master 's science to the ends of the earth , or to become protectors of science , like Archduke Ferdinand , future emperor of Germany . To them Galileo spoke of the universe and how nothing in it stands still , but all things ( contrary to Aristotle ) , all atoms , all stars , have their motion . And how Pythagoras the Greek , who lived before Aristotle , had said that the earth , too , moves and that it is not the center of the universe but only one of the planets of one of the stars burning out there in the shoreless sea of blackness . In 16og a rumor reached Galileo that a Dutch spectacle-maker 's assistant had accidentally discovered that by looking through two lenses , held a foot or so apart , things appeared larger . Although he had no model , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of the Campanile , the highest building in Venice .  | Up the many stairs after him puffed the Doge and the Senators ol Venice , in their velvets . And there , sure enough , they could see through Master Galileo 's lenses the streets ol Padua and people walking in them . A ship 50 miles away looked no farther off than five miles . The Senate voted Galileo an increased salary and a life professorship . He started making telescopes for sale . To the instrument which he reserved for his own use he gave the loving name of " Old Discoverer . " It made objects appear 33 times nearer . On that memorable night when Galileo swung Old Discoverer upon the heavens there leaped to his eye the grandest spectacle open to mortal sight ? the vista of infinity , its utter darkness lit by endless suns . Where his naked eye had seen only a misty veil , the lenses turned the Milky Way into a band of stars , and other stars seen beyond those stars . On that night modern astronomy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun . He found its fiery surface swept by strange dark storms ? sun spots we call them now ? and from their apparent motion across the face of the sun he realized that it rotates on its axis , like the earth . If so , was the sun not also traveling on some incomprehensible track of its own ? He swung his lenses on Jupiter , and discovered that the three bright stars on a line with Jupiter were not fixed stars , but were moving around it , moons to Jupiter . Later he found a fourth satellite of Jupiter , of the nine we now know . Here was a solar system in miniature ? evidence , to one who could reason , in favor of our own . So Copernicus the Pole had been right when in 1543 he announced that the earth turns daily on its axis and the planets revolve around the sun . Giordano Bruno had been right when he taught the Copernican theory in the universities ? right , though they burned him alive for it in Rome . That was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No wonder that some of the professors refused to look at the skies through this telescope . Thousands did look , however ; and were convinced ? scientists , nobles , cardinals , Pope Paul himself . But jealous philosophers joined forces with ignorant fanatics in denouncing Galileo to the Inquisition . For the heavenly movements which his lenses and intellect revealed were , they said , contrary to Scripture . The Inquisition forbade him to teach his doctrines about the solar system , and for 16 years he obeyed . Then in 1632 he ventured to publish his Dialogues Concerning the Two Principal Systems ? the Ptolemaic versus the Copernican . In this the supporter of the Ptolemaic system , a character named " Simplicio , " made out a weak and silly case . Whereupon Galileo 's enemies persuaded Pope Urban that Simplicio was a caricature of himself . The publisher of the Dialogues was told to stop the book 's sale ? though it had spread over Europe .  | Galileo was summoned to Rome . Now 70 years old , infirm with double hernia and palpitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cardinals . He was threatened with torture unless he recanted his scientific views . After four months in detention he yielded abjectly to the Vatican . Legend says that no sooner had Galileo recanted his belief in the earth 's movements than he muttered under his breath , " Nevertheless , it does move . " The spirit if not the fact of the story holds good . He had to get down on his knees and read aloud and then sign a document which " confessed " that the Copernican theory was a gross falsehood , and he promised never again to preach it or speak of it , on pain of death . He was then condemned to imprisonment and his book placed on the Index of forbidden works . There it remained , in spite of the efforts of great Catholic scientists to get it removed , until 1835 . By the intercession of the Duke of Tuscany , Galileo was released to become a permanent prisoner in his own house , where he was surrounded by spies . But though he was a prisoner , the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say they had seen the now gnarled old features and the piercing blue eyes of the chained eagle . At risk of his life Galileo smuggled out bits of the new manuscript on which he was working , to circulate in countries where thought and press were still free . He worked feverishly , for he realized he was losing his eyesight . That last book alone , Dialogues Concerning Two New Sciences , makes Galileo a titan , the founder of modern experimental physics . In it he took up the first principles of the flotation of bodies in water , and announced scientific principles of sound . He gave musicians experimental proof of the mathematical basis of pitch and harmonics . To engineers he left his knowledge of stresses and strains . He perceived the'gravitational pull of a great body on a small one . The 78-year-old Galileo died in 1642 ? the year that Isaac Newton was born . Even dead , he inspired panic among his enemies . They persecuted his friends , tried to keep not only his works but even his bones hidden . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharing in the superstitions of the age . Let us remember , rather , that Galileo was himself a deeply religious man . He believed that God reveals Himself every moment in the majesty of nature 's laws . Science is the lens through which to see those laws , and science , Galileo declared , can only advance .
