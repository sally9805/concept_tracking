Some very young convention delegates wandered around the University of Chicago last week , scuffing through the fallen leaves , hands in pockets , deep in thought . It was a critical time for them and for the world . <P> Their organization , the Student Federalists ( a tender shoot of Clarence Streit 's Federal Union ) , was divided . Should they be practical and accept the United Nations as a step toward their goal ? Or should they denounce U.N . as inadequate and demand immediate acceptance of their goal : the federation of the world ? <P> The delegates-150 of them , representing the four-year-old Student Federalists ' 3,100 members-came from U.S. colleges and high schools . The majority were from the once-isolationist Midwest . Juanita Will , bright-eyed and 18 , from New Paltz , N.Y. , had won the American Legion medal for being the best history student in her high school . Juanita arrived by airplane , a little pale from being airsick . <P> In U. of C. 's International House , they held their round-table discussions , listened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( poorly attended ) and one dance . They stuck to their business : the world to which they were heirs . <P> One delegate shrilled in committee : " Potentially all of us here are revolutionists . " Said a fellow committeeman : " Well , would you rather have that or be fried by some radioactive atoms ? " <P> They listened to 43-year-old Philosopher Mortimer Adler warn coldly : " I do n't think we can have a world government before the next war . . . . We will have to think in terms of working for world government beyond the next war and possibly one more beside that . " <P> They listened to blunt , 51-year-old Economist Beardsley Ruml : " The moral and psychological basis for world government does not exist . " They listened as 64-year-old Thomas K. Finletter , onetime special assistant to the Secretary of State , kindly urged Juanita and her colleagues to accept " a limited world government " as their immediate aim . <P> Juanita observed : " Old people want to work slowly . " <P> Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take any stand beyond proposing world government some time ( perhaps in 50 years , thought newly elected president Coky Prentice ) . With plenty of optimism the 150 went back to their schools to strengthen their ranks .
