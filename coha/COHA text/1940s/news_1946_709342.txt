txt Prime Minister W. L. Mackenzie King informed the House of Commons tonight that " a kind of Fifth Column " appeared to have been discovered in the investigation of Russian espionage . He said the spy organization was using Canada as the base to get information from the United States and Britain . The Prime Minister began his report on the espionage inquiry by saying that he spoke under a serious handicap because the case was before the courts and he could not impart all the information he would like to give . He told at length the story of how Igor Gousenko , cipher clerk in the Russian Embassy , had almost been unable to get a hearing . Mr. King acknowledged that he was very cautious and went even so far as to advise Mr. Gousenko to take all his documents and go back to the Russian Embassy . It was Mr. Gousenko who tipped off Canadian authorities on the spying . The documents received the most careful study for weeks before any action was taken , the Prime Minister said . He told how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told President Truman in Washington and Prime Minister Attlee in London what had been disclosed . Tells of Scientist 's Trip To the history of the spy hunt Mr. King added a new chapter about " an eminent scientist greatly trusted by the British authorities " who had taken part in the atomic research had failed to make the contact in London with a Soviet agent which had been arranged . This man was due to arrive by air in England last October just about the time Mr. King arrived there . It was known that he was to meet a Soviet agent , but somehow the rendezvous was not kept . Replying to criticism of the manner in which the inquiry had been handled and all the secrecy in which it was at first wrapped , Mr. King said that there would have been far more out-cry and criticism if the arrest of a few persons had permitted others to disappear underground and hide their fifth column activities . The secrecy , he said , had also been necessary to protect the names and reputations of some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ espionage organization was being set up in 1943 and 1944 , long before the atomic nomb was revealed . It could not , therefore , be argued that the espionage was the result of secrecy regarding the atomic bomb . Mr. King said that he hoped that no responsible person would , during the debate , suggest that diplomatic relations be broken off with Russia . " We want , on the other hand , to maintain and develop the most friendly relations in an atmosphere where everyone can breathe freely and feel safe , " he said . While in Europe last fall , he said , he had planned to go to Moscow and tell Premier Stalin what had been going on in Canada . " From what I have heard and know about him , " the Prime Minister said , " I am confident that the Russian leader would not countenance or condone such action in one of his country 's embassies . " For more than eighteen years , Mr. King said , he had taken an active part in helping Russia in time of starvation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and during the war Canada had helped in every way she could with food , munitions and mutual aid . It was he who had invited the Soviet Union to set up an embassy in Ottawa and had sent the first Canadian Ambassador to Moscow . What he wanted to do now , he said , was to unearth what might be wrong , clear the air and start again on the task of furthering to the utmost friendly relations with the Russian people , who could not be blamed for what a small group of people had plotted and for what a number of Canadian people had done . Fred Rose , Labor Progressive ( Communist ) Member of Parliament who has been charged with conspiracy and revealing secret information to Soviet agents and had been released on bail of $10,000 , took his seat as usual in the House of Commons this afternoon and remained unchallenged . The decision to avoid any action against Rose while he is on bail was taken after consultation between party whips and leaders who felt that as his case was before the courts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
