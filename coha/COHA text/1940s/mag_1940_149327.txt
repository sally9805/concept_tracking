The U. S. people are a one-language people . Unlike Europeans , many of whom are bilingual by second nature , most good Americans speak nothing but bad English . In school , they study foreign languages for " mental discipline , " usually finish their course better able to decline a French verb than to use it . But lately many signs have appeared that World War II may modify U. S. language habits . <P> Most sensitive U. S. linguistic barometer is the Berlitz School of Languages , which runs schools in nine big cities . It is patronized mostly by tourists , businessmen with foreign connections , U. S. military and diplomatic attaches , claims that it can teach a student to speak a foreign language passably in about 100 lessons , in as few as ten weeks . Last week Berlitz reported that since war 's outbreak last fall , business has boomed . Berlitz schools today have a record enrollment of 11,251 , next fortnight will open new branches in three more cities . <P> Significant were the Berlitz figures on specific languages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand for German : only one-fourth as many students as before the war . Enrollments in French and Italian were down to one-half . But students of Spanish had multiplied twelve-fold , today number 7,000 of the 11,251 total enrollment . Among them : Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller , last week appointed coordinator of U. S. commercial and cultural relations with South America . <P> Wrote Mrs. Roosevelt last week in her column , My Day : " I hope that in every school in this country we will teach the children to consider Spanish their second most important language . . . . This will encourage our Latin-American neighbors to make English their second language . "
