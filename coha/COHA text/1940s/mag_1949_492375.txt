I Park a Thousand Cars a Day By HANK BORDEN as told to STACY V JONES yOU 'D be surprised how many lost automobiles I 've found in women 's handbags since I started parking people 's cars twenty years ago . When one of our lady patrons says the claim check has disappeared , and she has to get the car right away and pick up the children at school , and what will her husband think , I suggest quietly that she look through her handbag once more . If she does n't dredge up the ticket then , I ask her if she 'll let me look for it while she watches . If she does let me look , I usually find it . The shape and markings are familiar to me , but to a flustered housewife it 's just another of many pieces of cardboard . So I pick it out from under two lipsticks and a shopping list , and she goes happily on her way . You ca n't very well go through a man 's pockets , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who really has lost a claim check is very apologetic . It 's a reflection on his orderliness and efficiency . So he waits patiently while we send boys with a description of his car through our ten-story parking garage in Washington , D. C. Sometimes one of our regular customers says we did n't give him any receipt at all for his car . Pretty soon he remembers that on that morning he broke his long-standing custom and left the car uptown . One duty of the attendant at the line of entering cars  --  whom we call a checker  --  is to give everybody a stub . Another duty is to make sure that the driver does not , from force of habit , pull the key out of thedash and put it in his pocket . When that does happen we have to push the car by hand out of the line and wait until the owner either realizes what he has done and brings us the key or calls for his car . Then there is the absent-minded customer who stands reading a paper , talking with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stopped near him . We call the make and license number over the loud-speaker , and sometimes this jolts him out of his reverie . If he 's the real absent-minded type , though , we do n't hear from him for a few minutes , and then he complains to the cashier that he 's been waiting a long time and we have n't brought his car down . We have to explain that we did , but that by now it 's tucked away upstairs again . SLEEP tonight ! She can thank Phillips ' ANTACID ACTION for this ! away for a few minutes . She leaves the car on our main floor and arranges with the checker to hand the baby the bottle if he wakes up . We ca n't give personal attention to pets , but if somebody wants to house his dog for a few hours in the car , we roll up the windows so the animal ca n't get out , and park the car as usual . To keep things running at the 1000-a-day rate , our relations with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just driving in has been cruising around and around the business district , trying to find a place to park within walking distance of his appointment . The parking signs in our town are especially complex and irritating . He has dented his fender getting into a short space , put a nickel in a meter , and then discovered that there is no parking there at that hour " Exc . Sun . &; Hol . " Well , it is n't Sun . or Hol. , so he has driven around some more till he spotted our sign . We try to take the car off his hands in zero time with zero friction . He just stops , gets out and accepts a parking stub from the checker . We do n't ask him how long he 's going to stay . The customer does n't even have to say a word , but he can grunt politely if he wants to . Now he can forget his automobile until he 's ready to go again . Once in a while a man really does forget his car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says he was at a stag party , describes his automobile and inquires whether by any chance he left it with us . We 're glad to get him and the car together again . Whenever a customer calls for his car , we try to make him comfortable . He can sit down in an enclosed waiting room and listen to piped-in music . If his wife is along , there 's a maid to look after her . He does n't have to wait very long , because we try to , get his car in from one to five minutes . If there are a lot of people with bundles ahead of him , maybe we ca n't do it . within that time limit . But he has an investment of from $1800 to $5000 in his machine , and he 'd rather wait an extra minute or two and be sure the chaser has time to handle it carefully . The chasers are the boys who park and unpark cars . " Car hoppers " is a less elegant term for them . I have forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranging in age from eighteen to twenty-six . They have to be fast on their feet and slow on the cars . When they 're not driving , the chasers get up and downstairs by our " man lift , " which is a sort of vertical escalator with spaced-out steps , on which seven men can ride at a time . It connects the first seven floors of our ten-story building . The top three floors are used for contract parking  --  meaning space that 's leased by the year or month  --  and for paint and repair shops , so there 's less rush getting to and from them . All the chasers have to pass the District of Columbia test for elevator operators before they 're allowed to use the man lift . I carry a license myself . During the rush hours , especially from four to six at night , we station chasers at the third , sixth and eighth floors and notify them via the " squawk box " of the space , license number and make of the car that 's going out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in each case . This saves a lot of time . I said we had a ten-story building , but it 's really twenty half floors , and those in the basement bring the total to twenty-three . It 's as if the whole west side of the building had been sunk half a floor . By splitting it down the center this way the architect cut the length and steepness of the ramps , and the easy grade helps in handling cars . For the first seven floors the ramps are one-way . After a chaser has been jockeying cars for six months he gets to know all the ramps and turns so well that he 's tempted to go too fast . During the rush periods my assistants are stationed where they can keep the speed down to about five miles an hour and enforce an interval of about one ramp 's length between cars . We used to consider it speeding any time the tires were crying , but the new low-pressure tires may squeal at almost any speed , so we ca n't rely on the noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the boys get very expert at starting all standard makes and models of automobiles . The manufacturer may have put the starter on the dash , under the dash , on the floor or in some invisible spot . One of my brightest chasers was once baffled by an old Auburn , and finally had to give up and look for the owner in the - * * * * * * * * * * A baby girl grows more and more like its mother as it begins to talk . ? SHANNON FIFE . * * * * * * * * * * waiting room . The owner was surprised that anybody could n't find his starter . " Why , " he said , " you just pull up the horn button ! " We usually ask the owner of a foreign car to explain its operation when he comes in . With some old Rolls-Royces that we housed before the war , it was necessary to turn a couple of gadgets and pump up the gasoline pressure by hand . The worst puzzles are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repaired during the war , when parts were scarce . The chaser steps on the gas pedal of a car that is supposed to have the starter button under the accelerator , and nothing happens . After a diligent . search , he notices near his left knee what appears to be a doorbell button . He pushes that , and the motor starts . Unable to get a new starter , the owner has just used what he could find at the neighborhood hardware store . If , through unfamiliarity or for some other reason , a chaser dents a fender , he is required to report it at once , so that we can tell the owner and repair it . No penalty is assesised against the boy . If we charged him for breakage he would be tempted to keep the damage a secret , and our public relations would suffer . Although we have to guard against repairing dents other people make , we often straighten a fender if a customer thinks we 're responsible , even though we 're doubtful about it . A careful check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As we have no back door , there 's only one exit . The-checkers stationed there know by sight the contract customers , who do n't present claim checks when they drive out . We have 300 parking spaces reserved on contract ; one big customer is a very active Government agency . If a chaser is driving a car out to deliver it at a hotel a note is made of the departure time , and he 's supposed to be back with the money after an allowance of ten minutes ' wait for the customer and the necessary walking time to the garage . The chaser 's character is naturally one of our important assets . About two thirds of them are ex-servicemen , and a number of them have been with me since the war ended . We always check applicants ' references and get credit reports on them . Nobody is accepted who has a record of drinking or reckless driving . Drinking , speeding and gambling'on the job are three reasons for immediate firing . Craps and matching coins start too many fights to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaser force is eight or ten months . Some are promoted to higher-paid jobs in the garage , and others find they can do better outside . You can see that I think pretty well of the chasers from the fact that one who graduated to work as a mechanic in the garage is now my son-in-law . In the twenty years during which millions of cars were driven out our exit , I know of only two instances of chasers taking cars without authority , and each time the car was recovered with no loss to the owner . Once a black Cadillac was transferred to a private garage in Washington , and had been painted a bright green by the time we found it . Another time a well-to-do restaurant owner stored with us a car that was to be given away in a contest for the benefit of a Greek church . The day he called for it a chaser had headed south with the car . It was recovered unharmed , the church went ahead with the contest and a small boy won it . With their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty dollars a week . A few customers tip both coming In and going out , although it is n't necessary , and the men are forbidden to suggest it . Hotel guests who leave their cars with us seem to regard tipping as a matter of course . A chaser told me the other day that in a recent week during which he made several trips outside the garage he was given twenty-six dollars , but I 'm sure that 's an unusually high figure . When Spike Jones plays a local theater there 's great competition as to who is to take his car to the stage entrance , because he 's a notably generous tipper . After a year the chasers get one week 's vacation with pay , and after three years two weeks ' . The company splits with them the cost of hospitalization and life Insurance . They pay for their uniforms at wholesale cost  --  in winter a cap , Eisenhower jacket and 0 . D. pants , and in summer , sun-tan shirt and trousers  --  but we take care of the laundry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with is the chaser who brings him his car , we try to school the boys to be Polite . I give each a set of rules , one of which reads : COURTESY MUST BE THE WATCHWORD AT ALL TIMES . FORM THE HABIT 45 OF USING THE EXPRESSIONS " GOOD MORNING , SIR . " . . . " THANK You , SIR , " AND " GOOD-BY , SIR . " MAKE A PRACTICE OF BEING NICE TO ALL CUSTOMERS . I also tell the boys to warn a departing motorist if he is low on gasoline or air . They report to me any matters requiring delicate diplomacy , such as the case of a driver who has leaned too long over the punch bowl . That is usually solved by having one of the boys drive him home . Often the owner himself realizes that he wo n't be too good behind the wheel and asks for a driver . If he prefers , we can send him home in our courtesy car , a station wagon that we use for the convenience of patrons who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the service department for repairs . It takes all kinds of people to make a world , and most of them come to Washington at one time or another . Our transient customers include a lot of foreigners , and it 's lucky that two of our men speak Spanish . I suppose we see more American tourists than any other category ; we get between thirty and seventy-five cars a night from one hotel alone . Now that the war restrictions are off , the capital is a convention center again , and lots of homefolks drive in , wearing ribbons and badges showing them to belong to the International and Exalted Order of This or That . One day we gave a tour of the garage for a group of teachers taking graduate work at the University of Maryland who wanted to be able to give vocational advice about parking and automotive service . And there are always delegations that have a bone to pick with Congress , such as a group of Oklahoma Indians who motored up to give a piece of their mind to the White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much like their constituents , except that they all seem to have minds of their own . One senator brought us a brand-new Ford station wagon , which the factory had finished in green . For some reason he had us repaint it a bright red . All complaints and disputes come to my desk . It 's a pleasure to deal with 90 per cent of the public , and you can get along with the other 10 per cent if you try . I have been able to handle even those who come in mad . One thing I found out early is not to get mad myself . I suppose I must be quite successful at smoothing folks over , because I do n't think that I have an enemy in the world . I must admit , though , that the job of keeping on my Sunday face all week gets a bit tiresome , and when I get home at night I 'm glad to relax it and scowl a little . My wife understands . I was born at Hanford , California , on September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old my parents moved to Virginia . My father farmed for some years and then bought a mill . About the time I finished the seventh grade , the family mill burned down and I had to go to work . In 1918 , when I was fifteen , I fibbed about my age and joined the Army Medical Corps . At first I was assigned to duty in the Army Medical School , but by making myself useful I became orderly to a brigadier general . I learned to drive in an old Army Dodge that had a " left-hand " shift , opposite to the pattern on today 's cars . I used to run errands for the general and drive him to and from his office . For a while after my discharge , I tried clerking in a cigar store , and then // ( Continued from Page 45 ) got into the restaurant business . While I was working in a cafeteria in the old Hudson Hotel , in downtown Washington , I fed the men who were building , and later those who were operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , when the hotel building was torn down , to walk across New York Avenue and get a job as a chaser . Since then , I 've held every job from chaser to parking manager . When I was a checker I knew the faces of 300 or 400 contract customers and could connect each with the make of his car and either the first or last few numbers of the license . This was more than the ownenhimself generally knew ; very few people can tell you their license numbers . Even today I connect people with cars they owned fifteen years ago . The faces of three of our old customers bring up mental pictures of the fine cars they drove in the early 1930 's . A theater manager had District of Columbia tag No. 120 , a lawyer No. 7520 and a stationer No. 2040 . Keeping track of 1000 cars a day is n't so complex as it may sound . The customer 's stub is torn off a long ticket which bears the same printed number . The chaser who parka the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the cashier , who can easily match it with the stub . Most people feel that parking charges are an evil that 's not altogether necessary . In the back of a man 's mind is the Idea that his city or his government or somebody owes him a place to park for free , especially if all he wants to do is mail a letter or buy a package of cigarettes . It 's hard for him to realize that it just is n't possible any more . Parking rates in our town are regulated only by competition . We charge thirty-five cents for the first hour , fifteen for the second , and ten for each additional hour up to a maximum of one dollar between eight A.m. and seven P.M. Theater parking from six to one is forty cents . Overnight is a dollar , and twenty-four hours is $1.50 . We do n't have disputes as to time , because we use time clocks in and out . The checker 's clock is kept fifteen minutes fast , and every quarter of an hour he stamps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incoming cars , usually fifteen . By this system the customer gets up to fifteen minutes ' free parking . If a man pays downtown rates , he does n't want to walk more than a couple of blocks to his appointment , nor does a woman want to carry her bundles farther than that . Our rates do n't hit the shoppers very hard , because fourteen merchants within the two-block radius pay for the first hour . That means that if a housewife drives to town , spends two hours and buys something at one of the near-by stores , she 's out only fifteen cents for the parking . On theater parking at night , a customer can clip a dime off his forty cents by getting the stub stamped at the box office of one of Washington 's three biggest movies . As a convenience to the pious , and without requiring any stamping , we grant a special rate of twenty-five cents for church parking on Sunday from ten to one . The New York Avenue Presbyterian Church is just across the street , and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaplain of the Senate , is one of our best customers . Obviously , on the daytime trade during the week we make our money in the first hour , and the bigger the turnover the better for us financially . But you ca n't push the public around , and we let people stay as long as they like . About 20 per cent stay all day . After a car 's been paiked as long as a month , we naturally wonder what 's happened , and investigate . In a few cases , a checkup with the police has shown the car to have been stolen . One man left a car with us for a couple of months . It turned out to belong to his wife , with whom he was having a divorce suit , and the judge finally instructed us to turn it over to her . It 's well to remember that most city parking places fill up around noon . You 'd better get to a garage before 11:30 or wait till after two ; otherwise you may find the " Sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason seems to be that almost everybody who comes in from the suburbs on a morning errand stays through lunch . The American motorist is quite casual about turning over his valuable property to the care of strangers . Probably it 's because he knows the car is n't negotiable except on the black market , and because he has insurance protection . In our case , with 1000 cars averaging $2000 in value , it 's as if we were a bank doing $2,000,000 in business every day . I wish people were n't so trusting about leaving fur coats , jewelry , guns , binoculars , cameras and ? even open cases of liquor lying about their cars in plain sight . We provide a free checkroom , where a customer can put anything of value , and warn everybody by signs and notices on the tickets that we are n't responsible for lost articles . Nevertheless , we get complaints . Often the missing object turns up at the Customer 's home . I have found a lot of gloves and sunglasses behind car seats , and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our lostand-found department . We 're proud of our employees ' record , but , after all , they 're human , and once in a while we get tripped up . Several years ago , when a number of articles were reported missing , we set a trap baited with a gold watch , and caught one of our own car washers . We fired him promptly . As a bit of general advice , I would say never leave valuables in your car , whether it 's in your driveway , at the curb in town or in a garage or parking lot . Things are n't much safer in the glove or luggage compartment than loose on the seat , because it 's simple enough to jimmy a lock . Ours is one of the few enclosed and heated parking garages . In winter it 's nice to get into a warm car , and in summer it 's nice to climb into a cool one , but autos can stand weather much better than they did in 1926 , when our garage was built . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides  --  really a series of parking tots , one on top of the other . For decoration , they usually have grillwork on the side toward the street . If I were starting out for myself in the parking-garage business fresh today , I suppose I would build one with open-wall construction , because that kind 's much cheaper to put up and requires no heating . I would have not more than five floors , each as big as the land costs permitted . Underground garages are probably efficient , but theconstruction is too expensive for private owners . I belong to the parking committee of the Washington Board of Trade . Although we need twice the parking spaces downtown that we now have , we think the problem will be kept in control . One proposal , which is now in an experimental stage , is to establish large parking areas on the edge of town and encourage people to ride downtown in streetcars and busses . Two parking garages are being built now in the business district , and no doubt new lots will be opened as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect to park my 1000 a day indefinitely .
