txt Daniel H. Coakley , veteran Massachusetts Executive Councilor , today lost the first skirmish in his impeachment trial before the Massachusetts Senate when that body , by a unanimous voice vote , denied him the right of access to secret records of the Special Commission whose investigation of the pardon and parole situation resulted in the 14 articles of impeachment against him . Following this reversal for the defence , President of the Senate Angier Goodwin set Aug. 25 as the date for the trial to start . Aug. 19 was set for Mr. Coakley 's answers to the 14 articles of impeachment and Aug. 23 for the replications by Attorney General Robert T. Bushnell . Voice Vote Asked Sitting as an high court of impeachment for the first time in 120 years , the Senate heard William H. Lewis , counsel for Mr. Coakley , make an eloquent plea that the defendant be given a transcript of all evidence and testimony given to the Special Commission . Mr. Coakley , through his counsel , asked particularly for the evidence on the Patriarca , Potter , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prosecutor for the House Board of Managers , directing the case against the Democratic Councilor from the Fourth District , immediately opposed granting such access to the defendant . Following arguments , Mr. Goodwin denied the motion of defense counsel Lewis who then asked for the voice vote of the Senate . One Question Remains Mr. Lewis told the Senate he would have two more motions to make but suggested that discussion of the motions be postponed until the date of the trial . He said there was one more question of law to be decided on the admission of testimony on the Limon case . Before a recess was called shortly after noon Mr. Bushnell said he wanted to obtain depositions from the Rev. Sistus Brambilla , and the Rev. Joseph Gibbons , whose names appeared on Patriarca pardon petitions , and from Thomas Costa and Francis Raymond Patriarca ; the last three all of Providence . The Attorney General 's request was granted by the Senate which at the same time gave Mr. Goodwin blanket authority for the taking of depositions from others outside the State if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirmish when the Senate denied its motion that Senator Jarvis Hunt , Republican of North Attleboro , Chairman of the Special Commission on Pardons and.Paroles " disqualify himself as a member of the high court of impeachment . " Mr. Lewis argued that Senator Hunt as a member of the investigating commission had already by voice and in writing expressed an opinion ? " hostile " to the defendant . He further argued that Senator Hunt by his service on the Commission " has inside information stored away in his subconscious mind , much of which wo n't be presented on the witness stand . " Senator Angier L. Goodwin , President of the Senate , and presiding officer at the historic trial said Mr. Lewis had answered the question himself when he pointed out that the Senate sitting as a court can not disqualify Senator Hunt . Senator Goodwin added that the motion " is directed to one member and therefore it is upon the conscience of that member to do what his own conscience dictates . The motion is denied . " After the session today Senator Hunt declined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Coakley case . While he agreed that a judge with a preconceived opinion or prejudice should step out of the case , the North Attleboro Senator said he believed he stood in a different situation than a judge in court . " A judge can be replaced and one judge is just as good as another to hear a case , " he continued . " But in this case , if I should disqualify myself it would not be a question of one man stepping aside to let another take his place ; it would disqualify one section of the Commonwealth . One Senatorial district would be deprived of its share of representation in this case . " No Blanket Plea Early in today 's session Mr. Lewis announced that Counselor Coakley " will plead not guilty to each and every article " of impeachment . He added that the defense would file answers in writing upon such time as determined by the Senate . The Senate resolved itself into a court of impeachment upon the motion of Senator John D. Mackay ( R ) , of Quincy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to govern the Coakley trial . Senator Goodwin was sworn in as presiding officer by Irving N. Hayden , Clerk of the Senate . The presiding officer thereupon administered the oath to all Senate members in unison , the members standing at their Senate seats . They swore to " truly and impartially try and determine the charges in question . " After Clerk Hayden was sworn in by Senator Goodwin , Charles 0 . Holt , Sergeant-at-Arms , read the proclamation opening the trial . Colonial Procedure Harking back to Colonial forms and procedure , Sergeant-at-Arms Holt , armed with . his Staff topped by a gold State seal , cried , " Hear ye ! hear ye ! hear ye ! All persons having anything to do before the honorable Senate now sitting in the matter of the trial of the impeachment of Daniel H. Coakley , Executive Councilor from the 4th Councilor District , draw near . Give your attendance and you shall be heard . God save the Commonwealth of Massachusetts ! " As the trial opened , the only Senatorial absentee was Senator Mason Sears ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been on active Naval duty . Clerk Hayden read the writ of summons to Mr. Coakley after which Mr. Lewis made his motion to have Senator Hunt disqualify himself . Senate Challenged In an effort to force the Senate to adopt a two-thirds majority 1 rule for a verdict on any one of the 14 articles of impeachment , Mr. Lewis entered two motions in writing , the argument on which will be postponed until the morning of Aug. 25 when the Coakley trial will resume . In the first motion , Mr. Lewis , well known Negro attorney , challenged the right of the Senate , prior to its egablishment as a court of impeachment , to make rules and procedure for the trial . Sometime ago the Senate , in regular session , voted that a majority of the Senators present and voting shall be sufficient for a verdict . Mr. Lewis said such action violated both the United States and Massachusetts Constitutions . The second motion called upon the Senate to establish a two-third majority for a verdict . Mr. Lewis , as counsel for Mr. Coakley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large impeachment trial before the Senate , staged in 1821 . At that time Daniel Webster was counsel for Judge James Prescott , who was removed from office . On the other hand , Robert T. Bushnell , acting as prosecutor , is standing in the position occupied , by Lemuel Shaw , later Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Judicial Supreme Court , who served as prosecutor in the Prescott trial . Defense Argument In the argument advanced to allow the transcript of testimony before the special commission , Mr. Lewis said that such access is " essential to make answer to the articles of impeachment . " " If we do n't have access to this testimony , " he added , " we ca n't meet concepts formed in your mind . " He pointed out that the Senators had access to the transcript of evidence and that they can make their decision " partly on what you have read and partly on ? what you hear , I defy anybody to separate it .
