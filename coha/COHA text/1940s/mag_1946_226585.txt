THE OLD COUNTRY ( 434 pp. ) - Sholom Aleichem ( translated by Julius and Frances Butwin ) - Crown ( $3 ) . <P> Ben Hecht calls Solomon Rabinowitch " the greatest humorist the Jews ever produced . " Rabinowitch was born in Pereyaslav , the Ukraine , in 1859 . In his father 's inn Sol grew from boyhood to manhood-and observed the customers . At 23 , he began to write-about the customers-for Hamelitz , a Jewish periodical . He took the pen name Sholom Aleichem , the Jewish equivalent of " How do you do ? " , and turned out copy like a mimeograph . <P> In 1905 , when the Kiev massacres drove him from Russia ( with his wife and six children ) , he found that fame had preceded him . When he reached New York , even Mark Twain came calling . Twain 's opening remark : " I 've been anxious to meet you for a long time , because people have been telling me I 'm the American Sholom Aleichem . " <P> In 1916 , Solomon Rabinowitch died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 300 short stories , five novels , four plays , innumerable articles . Last week , 30 years after his death , the English-reading world got its first wide sampling of the stories . Translators Butwin caution that the flavor of all 27 stories in The Old Country is weakened by translation . Even so , they taste pretty strong . <P> A few are just literary exercises in devious plot &; counterplot ; a few are plotless casuals of Jews at home , at work &; play ; but most of them employ a simple plot to make a simple point-the joy , or sadness , or mystery of living . <P> Considered singly , each story is like a peasant hut of " the old country , " crammed with populous , colloquial Jewish life . Most of the characters are credible : they haggle over fish , are starved or stuffed , often pray , sometimes forsake their faith , sometimes commit suicide . But occasionally Aleichem takes off from reality , and then he is at his best . He tells of people with one eyebrow black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a fiddle , whose goats change sex , whose clocks strike 13 , who drink so much they catch fire inside and burn to death . <P> Taken together , the stories will give the non-Jewish reader an explanation , wealthy with humor , of what has seldom been more readably explained-the intense , hieratic climate of the Jewish community .
