txt By Telephone to TEN NEW YOBS Timms . BELGRADE , Yugoslavia , Feb. ** Balkan Entente conference opened today with a three-and-one-half-hour ' discussion among the Foreign Ministers of Yugoslavia , Greece , Turkey and Rumania . The four statesmen held two sessions about the round table in the Council Chambers of* the Belgrade Foreign Office . The first talk began at 10:30 o'clock in the morning , one hour after the arrival of Grigore Gafeneu , Rumanian Foreign Minister , on a special train , and lasted until noon . The Ministers then visited Premier Dragisha Cvetkovitch and later lunched with Prince Paul at his palace . In the afternoon Premier Cvetkovitch repaid the call After leaving their cards with the two . sub-regents of Yugoslavia and with Vice Premier Vladimir Matchek , the Ministers met again for two hours starting at 6 P. M. It is understood that the initial session constituted a general review of the international situation . No specific problems will be examined until tomorrow , when the Ministers are expected to get down to brass tacks . It was unanimously agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoiding entanglements in the present war . After the evening session General John Metaxas , Greek Premier and Foreign Minister , told some Greek journalists that he was impressed with the optimistic atmosphere of the gathering and the unanimity of opinion as to its objective . It was agreed that the Entente would be prolonged for another seven years . This happens automatically if the Balkan pact is not denounced by one of the members before Feb. 9 . It is said that an understanding was reached ' whereby such a step would not be taken . // HOOVER URGES U. S. TO KEEP OUT OF WAR // were stopped the Bolshevist regime would crumble from within . Mr. Sarnoff , saying he had played a small part in improving the methods of communication ? " the value of which I am not so sure about myself " ? said that there still remained the need of trained men to get the news and interpret it . After the scheduled speaking a " Washington broadcast " was heard and for a time seemed to mislead many of the diners . Apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evident for several minutes , so expertly was the script phrased , that it was not the President speaking . After it was completed , Mr. Williams revealed that Bill Adams , who impersonates the President on " March of Time " broadcasts , had been the speaker . Several musical and vaudeville skits also were given . TEXT OF THE ADDRESS The text of Mr. Hoover 's address follows : The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse have now become nine . The new cavalry are : Imperialism , the destroyer of the indepenc nice of nations ; Intolerance , the destroyer of minorities ; Statism , the destroyer of personal liberty ; Atheism , the destroyer of faith ; And Hate , the destroyer of the unity of mankind . After them ride War and Death . And finally there sweep Famine and Pestilence . I need not tell you they are on the marchowhen two-thirds of the people of the world are at war . There is in reality peace only in the Western Hemisphere . But these destroyers will profoundly affect American life even if they do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propose to discuss only two of them and our relationships with them . They are Famine and Pestilence . There are elements of strategy , of economics , of morals and of the fate of nations , as well as of death , in this question of famine and pestilence . Famine in War Strategy Famine has become part of the strategy of war . To starve women and children of your enemy by blockade and by submarine is one of the major modern weapons . It is not a good thing to look at . But the march of famine in a world at war is more potent than as an ally of strategy . Western Europe for a hundred years , even in pease times , has not produced sufficient food supplies for its own population . It has relied upon the export of goods as exchange for food from outside its borders . But on top of this peace shortage of supplies , war results at once in diminishing the food nation . The drafting of man Power instantly diminishes the production of milk and of butter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals and thus when war ends their stock is depleted . Beyond this , planting of ground crops must be skimped . The harvesting is imperfect . And above all , the nitrate fertilizers must be diverted to explosives . It is true that each nation at war rations its population with view to reducing its food consumption . But rationing has little effect on the total consumption . War , experience has proved that armies consume about twice as much food as the same men do when they are at peace . That is partly due to the greater physical need . It is partly due to the inevitable waste and destruction . The effect of rationing in combatant countries is to make sure that the army has all the food it can consume and waste . And beyond all this the food production in the countries free of war is demoralized , for the normal markets in Europe are interfered with and diminished by blockades . And thus countries outside the war areas shorten their production . Out of all these forces a long war has only one inevitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowered vitality of famine comes pestilence . Pestilence Overcome During the year after the armistice in 1918 we sent something over 10,000,000,000 pounds of concentrated foodstuffs from America to Europe . That was many times our normal exports . And this food went not only to our Allies but to our former enemies . And of pestilence , an army of typhus came down from Russia on a front a thousand miles long . At its height a million cases raged with a deathrate of a quarter of those stricken every fortnight . Americans fought that battle and won . Without this service famine , pestilence and communism would have engulfed Europe . There would have been no peace of any sort . After the Thirty Years ' War a peace was made , and then it is said that one-half of the population of Europe proceeded to die from famine and pestilence . There was no America then . Unless peace comes in the next few months this is likely to be a long war . There is still the possibility of peace . The common people of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their homes grimly and without bands and cheering . There was no glow of glory or determination of revenge among the people . Unquenchable hate had not yet sunk into them . But modern war quickly flashes from wars against soldiers to war against civilians . As time goes on the blockade of food supplies , the attacks on cities from the air , will take more toll from women and children . Also as action becomes more violent the lists of dead stream back from the front into every family . From these wrongs and sufferings implacable hate will sink into every household . When this stage of outrage and bitterness is reached , statesmen can not carry their people to peace without victory . Thus it may become a long war , and in the end from this furnace-fire of hate , statesmen are forced by the people to make a Carthaginian peace . That was the history of the last World War . There was a time when brave men met brave men on the field of battle . Now cowards attack women and children from the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been driven homeless into the Arctic wastes . It is of course possible that this war might end by military victory . It is much more likely to be a long war ending from exhaustion on one side . The other will be but a lap behind . Then , as I have said , the horsemen of Famine and Pestilence will ride roughshod over all nations at war . America May Aid Recovery Now America has a role to perform . It can be a great role in our history . If we shall remain out of these wars , if we have maintained our economic and moral strength , we may be the means by which the world will have a chance to recover from these horsemen . If we join in these wars and exhaust our strength there will be no one to do it . And we have an intermediate service while these wars are in progress . To obtain food during war the combatant nations must have resources or credit with which to buy it from abroad . The greater nations at war have these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there are the little countries who are the victims of this war , such as Finland and Poland . Finland is still fighting with hope . Poland has been overrun . They are blockaded . They too are dependent upon imports for a portion of their food supplies . They too will be subjected to this diminution in agricultural production . But they have no resources with which to buy in the world markets . And theirs is a pressing question , for their harvests of last year and their accumulated supplies will be exhausted by this Springtime . Unless they can be supplied , famine will ride over them long before the end of this harvest year . And these same situatigns would arise were Belgium or Holland or Norway or Sweden attacked by the enemy . Food Surplus in U. S. We in the United States have a great food surplus . We can if the world requires it produce an even greater surplus . Out of our present surplus we can furnish the little nations without depriving our own people of one atom . I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loving liberty we have any moral right to stand by with these large surpluses of food and see people starve wholesale , who are helpless to help themselves . And more especially is this true if they are victims of aggression , if they are dying on their frontiers fighting for their independence and fighting for the survival of human liberty in the world . We have more than enough to supply our own people . We are making a plea for funds to meet the heartbreaking needs of Finland and Poland . The purpose of these funds is to take care of emergencies . It is to support the destitute , to provide for refugee women and children , the , sick and the wounded . Yet still another problem looms up at once . Food supplies to these whole populations including armies are greater than charity can compass . After all it is not such an enormous amount for both Finland and Poland . Thirty million dollars ' worth of our surplus , which is probably less than 5 per cent of the amount that we could ship without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations from famine and its inevitable consequence , pestilence . That is our immediate job . And beyond all this immediate job , when this war ends , if it be a long war , America will need to meet the question of famine and pestilence over the whole of Europe . And I commend to those who are thinking of the ultimate peace that the chance for civilization in Europe to come back again may depend upon America . If we are to be of service we will need to conserve both our economic and spiritual strength . I have spoken of hate and its possible domination of the peace table . We , in our indignation at wrong and aggression , must not be led into blind hates against whole nations . The great masses of the German people and the Russian . people are not responsible for the wars now going on . The vast majority of both these nations are gentle and decent people who pray for peace as do you and I. If we have not been enveloped in the poisonous air of hate , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pestilence , we might also exert a saving and constructive voice at the peace table .
