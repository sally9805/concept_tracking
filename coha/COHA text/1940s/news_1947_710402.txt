In a prepared address before the closing session of the Second National Conference on Citizenship , he said that , " although we were conquerors on the field of battle , the fight is not over . " Philosophies , alien to our democratic concept , still are abroad in the world , he emphasized , " and we would be untrue to ourselves , and false to mankind , if we minimized this peril . " Bringing the American ideal to fruition in the home , the church , and the school constitutes a direct " challenge to the conference and to every citizen of our land , " he added .
