Realizing for the first time the dire possibility of air raids on their country , the U.S. people acted like hens in a barnyard at the rumble of a sudden summer storm . Some were apathetic and carefree , some panic-stricken , many more earnest and eager to be helpful . Everywhere was a great cackling . Little hen-shaped Fiorello LaGuardia , head of the Office of Civilian Defense , glared out over a U.S. that was mostly confused and unprepared . <P> President Roosevelt flung the Little Flower into OCD last spring . Mr. LaGuardia set up regional councils , which did their best to start State and local councils . All were volunteer groups . About all OCD could do was provide blueprints and fatherly advice . <P> Its headquarters was in a commandeered apartment house in Washington . Last September , Mrs. Roosevelt , who had been faintly critical , moved in as assistant director . Young ( 21 ) , dimpled Jane Seaver , dew-fresh out of Mt . Holyoke , was appointed to the task of organizing youth . Other lady colleagues moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Roosevelt , mysteriously shuffled papers , kept mum . The Little Flower flapped his wings , screeched orders , left behind many a moist hanky clenched in an angry fist . <P> " Prolonged Study . " Most apathetic spot in the country was the territory served by isolationist Chicago Tribune , where the Tribune 's editorials and Charles Augustus Lindbergh 's shrill " they ca n't touch us " had all but drowned out OCD 's weak little toot . Last week the Midwest had just begun to yawn and stretch . In Wisconsin it was announced that plans for civilian defense were going to be given " prolonged study . " St. Louis declared that it would get around this week to enrolling some 50,000 volunteers which it figured it might need . <P> The West Coast , while civilian defense was still operating , was a military area ( see p. 9 ) . Along the East Coast , where confusion was as thick as anywhere , a horrible example was Mayor LaGuardia 's own New York City . City Hall , where the Little Flower was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he was also heading OCD , was in an uproar . Workmen piled into the mayor 's offices , tore up floors , laid wires , erected parti tions . Women in blue-grey uniforms , brass buttons and gold epaulets snapped salutes at one another and the mayor , twinkled off in all directions with Mr. LaGuardia 's orders . <P> Plans for blackouts were made , announced , called off . The mayor said it would " take 27,000 men or women to turn off by hand the street lights . . . . There are 27,000 separate switches . " The Board of Estimate appropriated $25,000 for sirens . One horn was tried . Citizens a few blocks away , anxiously listening , heard nothing but a faint moo . Most people heard nothing . <P> " This is Serious . " Air-raid meetings were attended by gay , lighthearted volunteers . At a meeting in an uptown Manhattan high school , citizens giggled at an expert who tried to explain how to blackout streets . Muttered a sad-faced , sad-voiced Frenchman : " How can they laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women block wardens until the tearful and embarrassed women gave up their jobs .
