Despite the clogging setbacks of the coal and steel strikes , and the mountainous burden of taxes , the U.S. was still an amazingly prosperous nation . The almost-forgotten recession of last spring had left only barely noticeable scars : personal savings were dropping a little and the old problem of unemployment , though lessening , seemed back for good .

When Christmas shopping began last week on the day after Thanksgiving , the U.S. public demonstrated dramatically that it was still a game gang with a pocketbook . <P> Chicago 's Loop was clogged with honking automobiles and pushing shoppers ; the Indianapolis street railway had to put every last car in service to handle the great crowds , and Seattle had one of the biggest downtown traffic jams in history . <P> The crowds were not clamoring to buy overpriced mink coats or $50 bottles of perfume . They shopped slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not afraid of expensive items so long as their money was going for quality and serviceability ; in television sets , they largely ignored both the low-priced portables and super-priced sets with Chinese lacquer . Most stores expected a drop in dollar volume , but still anticipated a big and profitable Christmas rush . <P> Few people talked any longer of a threat of depression ; the relatively minor damage done by the spring recession seemed to have reassured most of the doubters .
