The letter was barely civil . In cold , blunt words , New Hampshire 's Republican Styles Bridges , chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee , wrote to George Marshall : <P> " More than two months have now passed since you stated that ' a definite proposal ' for aid to China is under preparation for early submission . Two weeks have now passed since the beginning of the regular session of the Congress . No proposal for aid to China has yet been submitted to the Congress by the Department of State . . . . The good faith of the Administration . . . is now in question . . . . Only the immediate submission to the Congress of a proposal for the protection of the vital interest of the American people in Chinese independence can create confidence . . . and give us an adequate opportunity to carefully consider an aid program . I should appreciate early word from you . " <P> To the State Department , this was like twisting a dagger in an old wound . But George Marshall muffled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " A China proposal has been worked out by the Department and it will be submitted to the National Advisory Council and the Bureau of the Budget within the week . Upon the completion of their examinations , the President will be in a position to submit the program to the Congress . "
