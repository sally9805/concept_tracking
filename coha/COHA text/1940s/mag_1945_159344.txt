An embarrassing phase of postwar surplus disposal was well under way last week . By year 's end , said the Army , about 500 generals will be retired from service or reduced to subastral rank . From the war 's constellation of 1,540 generals , about 1,000 will be shaken out by next July . Many of them had distinguished themselves in war , but peace and demobilization had left them with little or nothing to do . <P> Some of them were stepping down voluntarily . Others would be sifted out by annual physical examinations , which were suspended for officers during the war . To the majority , who wanted to hold on to their stars , the Army was sending a polite , profuse letter : " My dear General " - advising some that they were going to be reduced to their permanent rank , some that they were going to be retired . <P> Many crack officers would be gone by year 's end . Soon to go was energetic , ambitious , 53-year-old Brehon B. Somervell , who as chief of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Already back in civilian life was Lieut . General William Knudsen , the War Department 's tireless coordinator and trouble shooter on war industry 's production line . <P> Others going or gone : 66-year-old Lieut . General Ben ( " Yoo-hoo " ) Lear , who fought in the Spanish-American war , onetime chief of the Army Ground Forces ; Major General Charles P. Gross , director of the Army 's complex and titanic transportation during the last three years of the war ; Lieut . General Jimmy Doolittle , famed wartime chief of the Eighth Air Force ( see PEOPLE ) . <P> " My Dear Admiral . " The Navy also had a form letter . It let " My dear Admiral " down with a gentler bump . Sent last month to all of the 369 flag officers still on active duty , the Navy 's letter simply asked ( for guidance in future planning ) if the admiral wanted to retire-please reply . Of those who had replied by last week , only 16 said they wanted to get out . Among them were Fleet Admiral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Royal E. Ingersoll , commander of the Atlantic Fleet throughout most of the war ; hardboiled Admiral Emory S. Land , for seven years head of the Maritime Commission . <P> Nevertheless , the Navy 's stars will also be rapidly thinned out . Scheduled to go by year 's end are 51 admirals who were recalled to duty after they had already been retired . The Navy hopes by next June to reduce its flag roster from the peak of 400 to 228 . <P> The Marine Corps had made no definite plans . Of the 81 generals it had at peak strength , only eight have been retired and only two more are scheduled to go .
