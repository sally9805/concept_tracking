Along toward dawn one morning last week , Screen Actor Humphrey Bogart was sitting , in person , in Manhattan 's not quite haut monde saloon , the Stork Club . It was the hour when it is virtually impossible to decide whether a rumba band goes bonkle bonkle tonk , or tonkle tonkle bonk ; when waiters ' arches ache , and blondes brush the hair out of their eyes in a queenly way . Bogart , who was sipping happily on a drink , decided to send out for two 22-lb. stuffed pandas . <P> A lackey rushed , muttering , to Reuben 's , an all-night restaurant which for reasons best known to its management , keeps such an example of the toy stuffer 's art on sale . He bought two large specimens for $25 apiece . Bogart welcomed them jovially , handed one to Manhattan Wholesale Grocer Bill Seeman , his drinking companion , and with the other under his arm , departed for the much more elegant El Morocco . All in all , it was a small thing . A nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amid El Morocco 's zebra-striped decor with a live giraffe . <P> Perilous City . But a great city like New York is full of perils . Three evenings later an attorney named Chester Mandel went into night court , and got a summons charging Bogart with simple assault . His client , an ultra-shapely young female named Robin Roberts , pulled her off-the-shoulder dress low on the port side and , as photographers leered happily , disclosed three marks on her upper bosom or lower shoulder . She explained that they were swellings and contusions . <P> Miss Roberts , a model , then told her simple story . She , too , had been at El Morocco in the small hours , and as she was leaving in a dignified way with a big manufacturing person from Philadelphia , she came within range of Bogart 's panda . At this exact moment a funny person asked her if she wanted the beast . She emitted a tinkling laugh and reached for it . Then this awful person , Bogart , charged out of nowhere at her . <P> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " seized her wrist , and " dumped " her . " It hurt , " she cried . " I was also humiliated . I said , ' Where do you think you are-in the movies ? Keep your damned doll ! ' " <P> " A Lovable Character . " The next day the tabloids bloomed with cheesecake and photographs , re-enacting the whole affair for posterity . El Morocco banned Bogart " for life " in a pronunciamento delivered in tones as sepulchral as if he were being sentenced to the electric chair . It was , the management explained , his second offense - he had once insisted on keeping his hat on and threatened to push his cigarette in a customer 's face . <P> Bogart 's wife , Actress Lauren ( " Baby " ) Bacall , issued a loud , public critique of his actions while in the bar at " 21 . " " This husband of mine has to go out and get loaded , " said Baby . " That 's what happens when you 're pushing 50 . This burns me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can quote me on this : my husband is wonderful . " <P> Bogart sternly denied that he had ever hit a lady in his life , described himself as " a lovable character , about as vicious as Margaret O'Brien . " When New York Post Home News 's Columnist Earl Wilson asked him if he had been drunk , however , he replied moodily : " Is n't everybody at 4 a.m. ? "
