Last week for the first time in English the operations of the weird Central Psychological Laboratory of the German Army were set forth in a fascinating pamphlet* issued by the American Committee for National Morale . Notable findings : <P> Indoctrination of Nazi fighters begins in school . History is fed to boys as a story of the great German destiny . Mathematics is taught in terms of bullet trajectories , range-finding , sextant-reading , aerodynamics . <P> As members of the Hitler Youth , the little leader-geniuses are searched for the qualities every German warrior must have : punctuality , orderliness , reliability , subordination , gregariousness , adaptability , diligence , will power , aggressiveness , acute sensory perception , practical talents . Each boy 's record is tabulated , analyzed and filed away , so that his complete case his tory of character development will be available for the future use of Army psychologists . <P> If the prospective warrior wants to be an officer he must graduate from a Gymnasium ( secondary school ) ; if he wants to be more than a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institute ; if he wants to be a general , he must earn a doctor 's degree in engineering-the hardest to get now in Germany . <P> He spends a year in the compulsory Labor Service , learning that it wo n't hurt his hands to use them for hard work , wo n't hurt his elbows to rub them against those of the lowliest Germans . Finally he is ready to join the Army as an officer-candidate . <P> Induction . Early in his Army career he pays a two-day visit to one of the Psychological Laboratory 's 17 testing stations . He is seated in a chair , asked all manner of questions , submitted to unexpected electric shocks , put to work on an ergograph ( machine to test muscle fatigue ) , given mechanical reflex tests . Without his knowledge a motion-picture camera hidden by a wall chart records every revealing facial reaction , every embarrassed ear-scratching , every fake posturing . His voice is tested for warmth of melody ( strong sympathies and emotions ) or hard , staccato timbre ( calm and determined will power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand writing and physical appearance are analyzed . As a test of leadership , he is given a group of infantry soldiers whom he must instruct and supervise in some manual operation , such as assembling a prefabricated bridge . <P> Back with his unit , he goes through a process of selection and weeding , in search of his aptitude . The adjustment to Army life is difficult ; and his own quirks must be ironed out . If he misses a sweetheart or newlywed wife , he is given some good hard labor to sweat his affection out on . If he is homesick he is granted frequent furloughs . If he is a recluse , he is trained in community spirit and team play . <P> Morale is constantly nursed ; fighting spirit is nurtured . For an hour every day officers gather their men to explain the political acts of the Nazi leadership , to give every soldier a sense of participation in history . Units meet for the singing of folk songs , for political , scientific and cultural lectures .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
