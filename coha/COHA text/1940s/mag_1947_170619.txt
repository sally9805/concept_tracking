Harry Hines Woodring of Topeka , Kans. is a man who loves nice things . As a private citizen , he likes tatting , antiques , and the view from his front porch , with its pleasant shrubbery and small lake . As a politician , he does n't care to associate with the hoarse , beefy men of the smoke-filled hotel rooms . <P> Maybe rough- &-tough; Charles Rooney should have known this . When Rooney , a red-faced , burly Irishman , returned from the Army to his Topeka law practice last spring , he thought he heard a call to arms . Harry Woodring was running for the Democratic nomination for Governor and was making a vigorous attack on Kansas ' much-flouted dry law ( TIME , Sept. 9 ) . Rooney put up some campaign money ( " If my wife knew how much , she 'd file lunacy proceedings " ) , tapped his friends for more , and became Woodring 's primary campaign manager . <P> But after Woodring won the nomination , Rooney found himself shoved into the kitchen while Woodring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned the slate of World War II veterans Rooney had carefully put together ; he ignored Rooney 's advice , and overlooked him when state and county chairmen were picked . But what really burned up Rooney , who had contributed " rather handsomely , " was Woodring 's ungrateful statement that he had had no expenses in the campaign . That did it . <P> Last week a deed was filed in Topeka , giving title to a piece of land 454 ft. wide and 180 ft. deep . The property ran almost up to the Woodring front porch and bisected the small lake . The buyer : Charles Rooney . <P> Rooney announced that he would build a row of " cheap but durable " houses on the land . The Woodring porch would command a view of their back yards , and little else . <P> Rooney had no intention of being unreasonable . He let it be known that if he were offered what he could make on the houses , he " might be tempted " to sell . Said Rooney blandly : " As long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought I 'd like to wind up the same way . " <P> It looked as if Harry Woodring , if he wanted to keep things nice , would have some campaign expenses after all .
