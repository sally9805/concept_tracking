Many a U.S. grocer and butcher , hog-tied by rationing red tape , sadly watched last week while good meat , butter and other foods spoiled in his store . This week the National Association of Retail Grocers sent a sense-making proposal to OPA : <P> 1 ) remove all luxury items ( caviar , anchovies , etc. ) from the rationing list ; <P> 2 ) set up a new category for butter , cheese , fish ; 3 ) liberalize meat points . <P> From Northwest lumber camps came threats of shutdowns unless lumberjacks get more red meat . But if OPA made an exception , it might have to do the same for other manual laborers.
