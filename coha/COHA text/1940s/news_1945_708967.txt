txt Letters to The Times Judge Frankenthaler 's Job Issue to Be Heard in Elevator Strike Not Under Labor Board Rules To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In your editorial of Oct. 1 " The Elevator Strike " you state : " Acceptance of the Governor 's proposal virtually substitutes one arbitration for another . That of the War Labor Board was unsuccessful . The union defied it and the board 's influence did not carry the weight to enforce it . " It would appear that this statement is premised upon a misconception . The arbitration now accepted by the parties is not coextensive with the issue before the Regional War Labor Board . The board had before it the determination of a controversy within the stated rules and limitations imposed upon our wartime economy . Promptly after the conclusion of active hostilities the National War Labor Board issued its General Order No. 40 , which , in cases not affecting price ceilings , removed substantially all of the repressive controls which required Labor Board approval . That order so far negated the earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salary increases * * * may be made notwithstanding any previous denial or modification of an application for approval thereof by the National War Labor Board or its agencies . " It is therefore quite obvious that the issue heard by Judge Frankenthaler will be very different from the one determined by the Regional Labor Board . He will be asked to decide the issue on the facts without consideration for the rules and regulations of the National War Labor Board which were terminated on Aug. 18 by General Order No. 40 .

Arts as Aid to Civilization They Should , It Is Held , Be Considered in Selection of War Memorials To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The suggestion of Charles Knight , in his letter to THE NEW YORK TIMES , that the arts pay tribute to the service men in World War II by erecting in their honor the great memorial to war and peace by the late George Grey Barnard will be endorsed by every historian . We , who have just completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time has come when we should cooperate with the sculptors and the painters in immortalizing the men who offered their lives to save civilization . The materialistic and utilitarian projects have their place , but they must not be allowed to set up a dictatorship over the spiritual qualities and the nobility of the arts . We must not enter an era in which the cultural Values become war casualties . Our patrons of art should organize immediately to protect and develop the esthetic spirit which through the mediums of sculpture , painting , architecture has been preserved through the centuries by church and State . The soul of America will be reflected in the memorials we erect to the crusaders who fought for human freedom . The spiritual integrity of America is at stake . Are we to degenerate into physical instincts , or are we to rise triumphantly to the divinity within us as expressed in the arts ? FRANCIS TREVELYAN MILLER , Director of Research , Historical Foundations of World War II . New York , Oct. 3 , 1945 . Dasher-Licker Emeritus Expounds TO THE EDITOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " brought on another mild attack of nostalgia these editorials often do , but it 's rather a pleasant attack , something like the mild headache that let a fellow stay out of school for a day . There are some details missing from your account of the good old-fashioned method of ice cream production . Have you forgotten how often the old burlap bag wore through when beaten with the flat of an axe ? Do n't you remember how the salt would occasionally leak through in spite of anything you could do and spoil considerable of the otherwise delicious confection ? Can you forget how the ? crank would stick on the last few necessary turns and make the whole contraption jump all over the place ? Life is like that : it took all of these trials and tribulations to give the final ecstasy of dasher-licking its utter completion . As the one-time champion dasher-licker of Dakota County , Minn. , I speak ex cathedra . LAMBERT FAIRCHILD . New York , Oct. 1 , 1945 . Dispelling Confusion TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to my previous letter published in THE NEW YORK TIMES of Aug. 11 with regard to the unfortunate attitude taken by an American Army lieutenant to the German Catholic Bishops who requested permission to hold a conference in Fulda . It included an obiter dictum which has , I find , been widely misinterpreted , and is being quoted out of its context so as to make it appear that I cast some slur on the loyalty of the many thousands of devoted Americans of German background . Of course nothing that I said in my letter was intended to carry this impression . No one appreciates better than I the extent to which America is indebted to the men and women who have come to our shores because they could not tolerate spiritual and other conditions in the German Reich under Hitler . How can one think otherwise than with admiration and respect of a group which includes such eminent figures as Albert Einstein and Thomas Mann , not to speak of the many thousands less well known but no less stalwart in their faith in democracy ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish or Christian , ; could not under Hilter have known the facts concerning Nazi aggression . That was true , for the press was controlled in a manner hitherto unknown . But the very fact that they had tasted persecution and tyranny made the men and women who came to America from Germany perhaps more sensitive than even our own people to the blessings of liberty . America has had no more de : voted sons than these adopted children , many of whom have given their lives for her . LOUIS FINKELSTEIN , President , Jewish Theological Sem. ; inary of America . New York , Oct. 1 , 1945 . Ethiopia Source of Meat Survey Indicated Large Surplusage of Cattle Available To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : It distresses me extremely to read such reports as those appearing in THE TIMES of Oct. 1 we the heading " World Production of Food Down Ten Per Cent . " It is probable that the statements are true . But it is also true that the resources of the world are not being utilized . So far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation and from authentic reports , that Ethiopia , for instance , has more than two million surplus cattle which it , is anxious to turn into beef . I also know that slaughtering these cattle and delivering the processed meat to the seaboard is a relatively simple operation . Reading such reports as yours I ask myself why such cattle resources as exist in Ethiopia and elsewhere in Africa are not utilized to feed the starving people of central and southeastern Europe . Eight months ago I was in Ethiopia as acting chief of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Mission sent there to explore the possibilities of what Ethiopia could contribute to the relief pool as well as what UNRRA. could do for Ethiopia . One of our recommendations was that the agriculture and the livestock industries of Ethiopia could be most success . fully assisted through the rehabilitation of the livestock industry which the Italians had begun to develop . But nothing has been done about this despite the fact that UNRRA is not getting , and probably will not be able to get , the meat which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in Europe . This is a source of meat which has not been tapped before . It is virtually a new source of supply which this hardhit world can scarcely afford to overlook . It would be most interesting to know the reasons which preclude the utilization of this source of supply . WYNA NT D. HUBBARD . New York , Oct. 3 , 1945 . Idleness Not So Profitable To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : William V. Negus ' conclusion in his letter published Oct. 1 , that under the law proposed by the Administration it would be frequently more advantageous to be idle than to work , is not based on facts . The withholding tax for an employe making $32 a week is not 20 per cent , but $4.50 , or 24 per cent if he has no dependents and $2.80 , or 8 per cent , if he can claim one dependent . If the same person could qualify for unemployment compensation he would receive under the present , as well as the proposed , laws not $25 but only $16 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent of his earnings . It can therefore hardly be imagined that under present living conditions anyone would voluntarily make a switch from employment to unemployment . And , since a person who has to . take care of one dependent would receive $13.08 , or 82 per cent more by working than by being idle , I can not conceive how the proposed law should encourage idleness . RUDOLPH J. LILIENFELD . Scranton , Pa. , Oct. 2 , 1945 . Appreciation of Good Reporting To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : THE TIMES is to be congratulated on the highly illuminating story on the unity discussions between Chiang Kaishek and Mao Tze-tung now taking place in Chungking . Your correspondent , Henry Lieberman , has written a most informative account of these extremely vital discussions which , I am sure , will be eagerly read by many friends of China who are anxiously awaiting news of the Chungking talks . Let us hope that we may have more of such detailed reports in the near future . FRED T. DOUGLAS . New York , Oct. 1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
