Except for the depot , there are only five buildings in Marshall Pass , Colo . Twice a week the train with the mail from Salida comes chuffing up the Denver &; Rio Grande Western , snuffling around the bare ribs of the Colorado mountains like an old hound dog on a cold trail . In the quiet at 11,000 feet , when the wind is right , Postmaster Gus Latham can hear the train coming about an hour before it arrives . Marshall Pass ( pop . 11 ) is the U.S. 's smallest post office . Gus , who has lived in Marshall Pass for the last 21 of his 64 years , has been postmaster since 1943 . Said Gus : " I get maybe six letters a week , maybe nine . Maybe one package . " <P> A couple of months ago , Gus read in the official Gazette about the postmasters ' 44th annual convention in New York . Gus wrote to New York 's Postmaster Albert Goldman , asking him to reserve him " one single room and bed for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you choose my hotel , for I must be in company with other postmasters so that I may not get lost . I have never been in a large city . " <P> " We Sure Do . " Last week Gus arrived in New York , a tall , weather-tough man with crinkled eyes and a face reddened in the high mountain winds . He proudly donned his postmasters ' convention badge , dutifully attended the sessions , listened gravely as Postmaster General Jesse M. Donaldson declared that the post office faced a record $550 million deficit , that Congress should overhaul its " horse &; buggy rates . " Penny postcards , Donaldson pointed out , cost the department 2.6 to print , sell , and handle , and 95% of them are sold to advertisers who flood the mails with them " by the billions . " Gus nodded soberly . <P> Afterward , Gus posed with Donaldson and Goldman ( who is postmaster of the U.S. 's largest postoffice ) . Gus was unruffled . " Hey , Gus , " yelled a newsman , " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We sure do , " said Gus . " I sure hope that ai n't a federal offense . " <P> Gus , a part-time postmaster , gets only $252 a year from the department . " Mostly I work on the railroad . Four of us shovel her clear in winter , and clear out any drift that comes down in summer . I get plenty of time to go fishin ' . We do n't have any officials , you might say . Depending on who 's around , the depot master is mayor , or I am . " <P> Gopher Holes . Gus is unmarried . " Last time I asked a girl to be my wife , she said , ' Can I get down that mountain to see a show every night ? ' When I said no , she said ' No . ' " His office is in a corner of the depot . Gus explained : " I 've got a table and two chairs . Nothing to lock up except the cash drawer , and I would n't do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , Marshall Pass had a brush with the enemy . Said Gus : " I do n't like to mention his name . He 's in Leavenworth now . He was up there , and well , I could see he was n't doing what he said he was doing . Never mind , I just knew . I turned him in to the government man , and the FBI came around and found he had a short wave radio and was sending to the Nazis . That 's all . " A friend urged : " Go on , Gus , tell the whole story . " Gus was firm : " We should n't say bad things about people unless we have to . "
