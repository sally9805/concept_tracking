Two battles for ports bitter-ended last week . Brest fell , yielding almost 40,000 prisoners . Boulogne fell , yielding more than 10,000 . But the profit for General Eisenhower was small . <P> Brest was an extreme example of the Germans ' destructive efficiency . Having tied up three U.S. divisions in the 46-day siege , the Germans left it unusable as a major port for many weeks to come . Censorship permitted no appraisal of the time that repairs might require , but the censors passed descriptions : of a swing bridge standing on its head in the river ; of crumbled docks and buildings toppled on ships whose stacks stuck out of the water at crazy angles ; of cranes and derricks scrambled in acres of rubble nearly 20 ft. high ; of U.S. engineers gloomily remarking that maybe the best idea would be to raze everything and start afresh . <P> Growing distances , growing battles and still-growing Allied armies now called not for a miracle but for a supermiracle of supply unless more ports could be opened . From the few known and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse than it looked superficially : <P> Of relatively little use , because of their smallness and their dependence on tidal locks ( almost certainly destroyed by the Germans ) , are the captured ports of Saint-Malo , Caen , Ostend , Zeebrugge , Boulogne , the still-besieged ports of Calais and Dunkirk . <P> More or less completely wrecked are the captured ports of Brest and Le Havre ( where the liner Paris lies sunk on her side ) , the besieged ports of Lorient and Saint-Nazaire , and probably the still-to-be-besieged ports of Amsterdam , Rotterdam and Hook of Holland . <P> Besides laboriously rebuilt Cherbourg , the best bets for General Eisenhower appeared to be 1 ) Rouen , nearly 80 miles up the Seine , which was swiftly taken , apparently without major damage , and became usable when Le Havre , at the mouth of the river , was captured . ( At Rouen were more than 150 berths for ocean-going ships , Europe 's largest oil-storage dock , facilities for transfer to river barges. ) 2 ) Antwerp , also taken swiftly , with little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven from the mouth of the Scheldt . When Antwerp is opened , the supply lines to General Eisenhower 's northern armies can be shortened some 300 miles .
