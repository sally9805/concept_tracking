txt John L. Lewis upset the equanimity of the bituminous coal industry today by informing the operators that the United Mine Workers of America is free " to take any independent action necessary " ' because the employers ' representative on the Mine Welfare Fund has refused to agree to his proposed pension plan . The letter threw the coal industry into a turmoil . While it said nothing of a possible strike some operators believe that the Lewis strategy may lead to a nationwide stoppage unless they " cave in " and grant the miners what Mr. Lewis demands , a $100 a month pension at the age of 60 after twenty years of service . Coal operators from all over the ' country telephoned around today asking each other what they thought Mr. Lewis had in mind by his letter . They called up the National Coal Association and the Southern Coal Producers AssociaVon and their district associates to find out but at the end of the day were as much mystified as they were at the beginning . Even some operators who saw Mr. Lewis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to get him to explain what was in his mind . " We just do n't know what his letter means " said one large of , erator . Coal men from various parts of the country are converging on Washington to discuss the situation . Some feel that the letter which they received in today 's mail but which was sent out last Saturday ( although dated today ) was something Mr. Lewis might use later on to prove that he had given the sixty days notice of a strike required under the Taft-Hartley Act . If so that would mean a threatened walkout on April 1 . That is the traditional date for such stoppages . A further complication in the tangled situation was the resignation of Thomas E. Murray , New York capitalist , from the Welfare Fund set up in 1947 . Mr. Murray was not available for comment but it was reported that he had resigned because of the inability of the operators and miners to agree to a pension plan . One report was that Mr. Murray had suggested a way out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retains his trusteeship with Mr. Lewis and Navy Capt . R. N. Collisson in the 1946 Welfare Fund set up under the Krug-Lewis agreement . Under this fund about $2,500,000 is being paid out monthly . The 1947 fund is untouched . " Reticent " on Action Mr. Lewis was more than usually reticent . His office did not give out the letter he wrote to the operators . Usually , when the president of the miners ' union wishes to enhance public interest , he refrains from making public such important communications , knowing that they will " leak " to the press through the operators . By this means he focuses broader attention on his dramatic move and stirs up speculation and conjecture . That is what he did today . Here is the letter sent out under Mr. Lewis ' signature : " To all signatories of the national coal wage agreement of 1947 . " The national bituminous coal wage agreement of 1947 required , among other things , the designation of a pension fund ( out of the United Mine Workers of America Welfare , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or annuities for the members of the United Mine Workers of America or their families or dependents and such other persons as may be properly included as beneficiaries thereunder . " On this date , seven months after the effective date of the agreement , your representative trustee , Mr. Ezra Van Horn of Cleveland , Ohio , continues ( as he has consistently continued ) to thwart the fulfillment of that contractual obligation . It now constitutes an outstanding , unresolved dispute , national in scope and character , affecting the integrity of the contract and impeding its fulfillment . " The United Mine Workers of America , therefore , now advises you as a signatory to the agreement that it reserves the right , at will , to take any independent action necessary . " Provides for Bargaining The contract to which Mr. Lewis referred was signet on July 7 , 1947 and expires on June 30 , 1948 unless either side gives thirty days notice of cancellation .

However the operators indicated that they will " sit tight , " consult their attorneys and wait for developments . Perhaps Mr. Lewis , they fee , will be MOP ' communicative when more of their number arrive in Washington . The Welfare Fund , set up two years ago as a concession by Secretary or the Interior J. A. Krug , was established from contributions of 5 cents a ton , paid by the operators . Under the new contract it rose to 10 cents a ton which would mean $60,000,000 annually at the present rate of production . Last December Mr. Lewis proposed his pension plan at the meeting of the fund 's three trustees . He is chairman . Mr. Van Horn , operators spokesman , refused to agree . He argued that the actualarial base for the pension plan had not been established and that if it were agreed to the cost would be more than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public .
