A red-white- &-blue; ribbon , severed in the middle , fluttered in the Arctic wind . The first U.S.-to-Alaska land route ( TIME , Aug. 31 ) was formally open . Trucks began rolling supplies along the 1,500 miles of double-lane , partly graveled highway from Fort St. John , B.C. to Fairbanks in the heart of Alaska . <P> Before the Yukon formality , two bulldozer drivers had an opening of their own . Negro Corporal Refines Sims Jr. , pushing his bulldozer down from the north , saw trees falling toward him . Over the fallen trees from the south Private Alfred Jalufka of Texas clawed and jerked his own bulldozer . The highway crews at last had met-20 miles east of the Alaska-Yukon border . The Negro and the Texan leaped from their machines and shook hands . The seven-month job was almost done . Then they backed their bulldozers and began widening the trail they had opened . <P> To the U.S. Army Engineers , who did the building , " road open " means that trucks can travel up &; down as fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel only temporarily , they hope . Ice , breaking in the 200 bridged rivers , will take out many of their bridges . But the Engineers are prepared . Crews will stand by to replace wrecked bridges . <P> The highway was built as much to supply the airfields along the route as to supply Alaska . There were signs last week that the U.S. was preparing to assure Alaskan supplies by constructing a 1,440-mile railroad from mid-British Columbia to Fairbanks , perhaps to Nome . Since last spring the route has been quietly surveyed under U.S. Engineer Colonel Peter Goerz . A Seattle steel company has bought up the rails from a half-dozen defunct railroads . Washington has discussed the route with Ottawa , and has considered buying a decrepit , 350-mile Canadian railway ( between Vancouver and Prince George-although it does not quite reach either ) which would fit into the new route . <P> Faster and less vulnerable than the water route , the railway would insure transportation to make Alaska a supply base for a drive against Japan-should Siberia be opened to U.S. forces .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
