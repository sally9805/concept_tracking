Miracle on 34th Street ( 20th Century-Fox ) is brought about by a well-beavered , somewhat pixillated old gentleman ( Edmund Gwenn ) who calls himself Kris Kringle and is n't kidding . So far as he is concerned , he is the original , the one &; only Santa Claus . As such , he is well pleased to take the throne in R. H. Macy &; Co. ' s toy department . His employer ( Maureen O'Hara ) regards him as a harmless old lunatic and her grimly progressive little girl ( Natalie Wood ) is sure he is an outright fraud . Kris stakes his earthly failure or success on winning them over to the faith . Meanwhile he raises hob with the Christmas-rush spirit by directing customers to rival stores , whenever Macy 's merchandise is not exactly what they want . <P> Miss O'Hara , outraged , sets the house psychiatrist ( Porter Hall ) on Kris Kringle , but " Mister Macy " calls off the goons when it develops that Kris has turned one of the most lucrative good-will tricks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compliment-he and Mister Macy are even photographed shaking hands-and the whole Manhattan department-store trade glows with the new love-your-neighbor policy . <P> But the villainous psychiatrist maneuvers Kris into a sanity trial , during which Attorney John Payne , a glad eye on Miss O'Hara , manages by elaborate legal flummery to have him declared competent . By the fadeout , not only the courts of New York State but 20th Century-Fox itself are ready to insist that there really is a Santa Claus , and that Mr. Gwenn is it . <P> Almost certainly he is , so far as the box-office is concerned . Author-Director George Seaton has laced his sure-fire sentimentality with equally sure-fire wit and some cynical knowledge about how men of business and law might talk , look and act under these extravagant circumstances . The movie handles all its whimsy deftly and is consistently a smooth , agile job . <P> It also preaches a strangely ambiguous moral . Kris Kringle inveighs against the commercialism which has perverted Christmas . But most of the wit and comedy in the show , all of the logic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that faith , honesty , kindness , magnanimity and the innocence of the imagination are chiefly to be respected because no other kind of investment pays off a fraction so well , in hard cash and at the voting booths . <P> <P> High Barbaree ( MGM ) is distinguished from the usual run of screen romances because it uses some of the elements of genuine romance , and uses them sincerely . Its theme : dreams and ideals , lost and at length regained . <P> The story is told in flashbacks by Navy Flyer Van Johnson to a notably patient fellow derelict , as they drift along the Pacific in a disabled plane . As a small-town boy Van wanted to be a doctor , and spent a lot of time with the little girl next door . He drank down the wild stories of his seafaring uncle ( Thomas Mitchell ) as eagerly as the uncle drank whiskey . The uncle 's tales of the uncharted , paradisiacal island " High Barbaree " especially fascinated the boy ; High Barbaree became his byword for all he ever hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little girl next door moved away . When she returned grownup ( June Allyson ) , the boy was no doctor ; he was shaping out a too-smooth career as an aviation executive , and was engaged to the boss 's daughter .
