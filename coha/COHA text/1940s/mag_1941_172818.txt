At Thunderbird Field , near Phoenix , Ariz. , where U.S. student flyers are now stationed , arrived 50 Chinese , prospective airmen . Within the next few months they will be followed by several hundred others . <P> Their course , like that of the R.A.F. candidates training at British schools in the U.S. , will run through 20 weeks . At the end of this intensive course , they should be the best Chinese flyers in the world , able to carry the war to Japanese territory , and fight off bombers attacking the Burma Road , come hell or high water . <P> Short on mechanical training , most Chinese flyers up till now have been trained in a hodgepodge of Chinese , Russian and U.S. methods . In U.S. air schools , under Army-supervised private instructors , they will be taught to handle U.S. Lend-Lease bombers and fighters in the manner to which the planes have been accustomed . Anticipated output of Chinese airmen at Thunderbird , which is operated by Southwest Airways , Inc. : 200 Chinese trainees every 20 weeks . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mum on all matters , they admitted only that they were " velly happy . "
