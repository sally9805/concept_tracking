NEVER HIT CRIPPLE A Story MAXWELL ARNOLD EORGE says , " the girl said to me , " George says the best thing is not to look at them . " The girl  --  Gerry , a nice girl of a kind  --  was sitting at the bar with me , and coming into the cheap night club were three crippled soldiers I was n't supposed to look at , according to George , the bartender . " Why does he say that ? " I asked . " I do n't know , but George knows how these cripples are and maybe you look too much at them they get the wrong idea and there 's trouble . " " Well , I do n't want any of that . I just want another drink or so and then we 'll go . And another dance . I like dancing with you . " " Sure . " " If looking at them means trouble , I 'm certainly not going to look at them , " I said . " What 's the matter with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face is terrible , and all that . The three of them have got all there is . " She stopped to tell me to give her a cigarette . " I do n't mean that , " I said , sliding her the pack and the matches . " I mean , what 's the matter with them they 're so touchy ? " " I do n't know . They raised a lot of hell in here last night . " " What kind ? " " Nothing very bad , " she said , " just kind of noisy and drunk . Just like all the soldiers were during the war , only a little , worse , maybe . But do n't pay any atten-tion to them and you 'll be all right . " I thought that over with my drink . Gerry was looking in her glass thoughtfully and then she said she was sorry for them , how awful it was to be crippled like that . That was so , I agreed , and I was glad I 'd got through without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said that she was glad too , which was all right for her to say , but it was a little off-pitch , seeing I 'd known her only a couple of nights . " I 'll be back in a minute . Order me another drink , Eddie dear , " she said , and left , to fix her hair I think is what she said . I watched her walk away  --  she had a nice walk  --  and then I looked around for the cripples . I did n't see them and I was wondering if they 'd gone back to a table when they came out of the men 's room and started for the bar . One of them , the tallest , had an overseas cap on , but the others were n't wearing caps and they were n't carrying any . I do n't think they even had any caps with them . That 's what it looked like , because that 's the way they were dressed . Sloppy . They had on part of every uniform out of the bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one crutch with his good arm . His other arm was there all right , but there was n't much to it that I could see , and he held it as if his jacket sleeve were sewn to his side , with the stitches running right down to the hand , lacing the fingers together and tacking them , like a mitten , to his trouser leg . He was pale , the yellowish way , and his eyes were stuck over worn , black crescents . His hair fell in sick strands over his forehead , even though his cap was on straight . One of his friends had an empty sleeve and there was something wrong with his face , but it was n't clear just what it was except that it had a pasted-up look around the temples . When he came nearer I could see he had no hair around his ears . Not that it was shaved off , but the skin he had there had once been somewhere else and it was n't the kind of skin that was ever going to grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cane , which he managed with some ease and perhaps a little bravado , maybe like a dying actor making his last stage entrance . It was n't that he looked ill , because he was in better shape really than the others , but that 's the way it was with the cane . I turned back to the bar . Maybe George had the right idea , and I did n't want to look any more , anyway . I was sorry for them , but they say you should n't be sorry , or show them you 're sorry , that 's for certain . The poor bastards . What kind of a postwar world could the advertising boys work out for them ? That 's one ad I would n't want to work on . T HE soldier with the cane took the chair that I was holding for Gerry , and the other two crowded behind him . I did n't see this until he was seated . I had n't expected them to take a place near me , or so quickly , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his way and said , " I 'm sorry , soldier , but that seat 's taken . " The soldier with the cane grinned at me . I waited for him to say something , but he just kept looking at me and grinning . " I said , I 'm sorry , but that seat 's in use . " " That 's all right , " he said . He turned to his friends and said , " It 's all right , is n't it ? " " Sure , Miller . You sit there . It 's all right . " I did n't like the look of what they were doing , and I did n't like the sound of them . " No kidding , " I said , " my girl 's got that seat and she 'll be back in a second . " Miller , the soldier with the cane , said , " That 's okay , we 'll wait . " Miller and his friends thought this was a funny idea and they laughed together . I smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's only a couple of other people at the bar . Why do n't you take those seats ? " Miller glanced at the other soldiers again and said , " We thought we 'd sit here and then you could buy us a drink . " If they 'd been anybody else I 'd have told them that for my money they 'd had enough to drink already , and they had , too . They were dripping with it . But I did n't know how I felt about buying them a round or what to say about it if I did n't feel like buying , and it was convenient that Gerry returned before I had to say anything one way or the other . " This the girl with the seat ? " Miller asked . That got a laugh from his friends . " That 's all right , soldier , " Gerry said . She smiled brightly at him and moved her things down the bar to the other side of me . " We 'll be back for that drink after we have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his friends moved off after him . After they had limped away unsteadily , I asked Gerry if they danced . " They try to . " " My God . Who do they dance with ? " " Oh , the girls around . They say anything to you ? " " The guy in your chair wanted me to buy them a drink . " " You did , did n't you ? " " Why should I ? " " It would n't hurt . Poor guys . " " Maybe I would have if he had n't asked . Nobody but a bum has ever asked me to set up a drink . Look , they 're getting a drink off that guy down the bar . " The three of them had surrounded a man who was drinking alone , and now he was getting out some money for a round . George was taking their orders , and the man did n't look as if he minded paying . " I think that 's pretty cheap stuff , " I said . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what do you care ? Do n't be so rough on them . . . . Did you get me another drink ? " I ' D forgotten , so I called George over and ordered . When he brought the drinks back to us I said , " What 's the story on those soldiers , George ? They just tried to bum me for a drink . " " I do n't know -- -nothing . Everybody buys them drinks . They got a few coming , Eddie , do n't you think ? " " Sure , I told him that , " Gerry said . " They 're broke , " George went on , " arid they just like to have a little fun . They 're in the army hospital down the south end and they come in every night for a few drinks . They ai n't got much money , that 's all . " " Are they still in ? " I said . " They wo n't get out until the Army 's done all they can for ' em , then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their pay while they 're getting fixed up . That guy with the crutch , see him ? Well , he 's got an artificial leg now and he says they 'll probably have to take the arm off , too . It ai n't any good to him . You see how it hangs ? " I nodded and paid him for the drinks . " They 're kind of tough guys to handle , " George said , " but they 're all right , and if you do n't pay any attention to them they wo n't bother you . " " I do n't get it , " I said . " How do they bother anybody ? " " They can get rough . That little one with the cane  --  Miner  --  smacked somebody over the head with it the other night . I had to get the cop to help Ralph get him out . " " That 's not so good . What was it all about ? " " Some dame . He 's all right . Just let ' em alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em alone . " " They ought to be left alone . They 've got enough troubles . But hell , George , if they 've got free drinks coming it does n't mean they should go around asking for them . I know some wounded vets and they do n't act like that . " Gerry turned to me and asked , " What 's eating you anyway , Eddie ? " " There 's nothing eating me . I guess it 's just that I do n't know exactly how to take those guys . I feel bad about them , but I do n't like to see them trying to cash in on it . Come on . let 's dance . " We passed the soldiers on our way to the floor . They were at the end of the bar where they could watch the dancing , and they were having a lot of fun about it . Gerry was a good dancer and I forgot about the soldiers until I saw the tall one with the cap and the crutch hobble out on the dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he was following another couple who finally stopped to talk to him . Then the soldier began to talk to the man alone and in another minute was dancing with the girl . The man behaved very cheerfully and took the soldier 's crutch over to the bar to give it to the other soldiers . It was n't the kind of dance you 'd want to watch more than you could help . The soldier , his cap still on , was making a very dignified effort to dance , but he was using all of himself to keep from falling . His arm was n't any good to him , and it was the girl who was holding him up and at the same time moving him around carefully to make it appear as if she were n't doing the leading , and it was a very good try . The soldier was smiling happily , delighted with moving around in something like a dance , and his friends watched him from the bar . They were laughing as if it were a joke , and they kidded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the bar . The soldier and the girl stopped after a while , and when the crutch had been brought back to him they left the floor . The soldier joined his friends and they began to talk excitedly , slapping him on the back . The soldier with the empty sleeve made an obscene gesture with his good hand and they all laughed noisily . Then they moved down the bar out of sight . " He was pretty good , was n't he ? " Gerry said . " Yes , poor guy . I guess they 'll do anything to dance . It looks like all they want to do is drink and dance . " " Well , what else is there ? " " I can think of a couple of things . Let 's go back and finish our drinks and get out of here . " The three soldiers were back by our seats . Miller , the soldier with the cane , was in the second chair Gerry had taken . " Hi , " he said . " We came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd had first and I sat down between her and the soldier . His friends stood behind him , looking at us . " Okay , " I said , " what are you drinking ? " " Do n't you want to see our medals first ? " I 'd noticed they were n't wearing any ribbons . I sat down and asked him as pleasantly as I could which ones he had . " I got the works , but I do n't carry them around . I see you wear your medal . " He took hold of my lapel and inspected my discharge button . " Marines , huh ? " " No , Navy . It looks like Marines but it reads different . " " I thought you was Marines . " " No , sorry . What do you guys want to drink ? " They all wanted rye and I ordered the round from George . " Are n't you having a drink ? " the soldier with the crutch asked me . " We 're just finishing ours . " Gerry said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , Eddie dear . " " That 's the girl , " the empty-sleeved soldier said . " Miller , you can show her your medals . Show her the big medal , Miller , " They all thought this was very funny and Gerry laughed with them . " I bet you have n't got any medals , " she said . " We got them all , " the soldier with the crutch said . " I got three Purple Hearts myself . How about it , honey ? I 'll show you the Purple Heart if you dance with me . " I looked over at Gerry when he said this and before she could answer I said , " We 're shoving off now , soldier . Have n't time tonight . " " He was n't asking you , " Miller said . " That 's okay , " I told him , " she 's with me , and we 're leaving . Sorry to break it up . " " Oh , Eddie , I can dance with him a minute . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gerry . Come on . " " Wait a minute , " Miller said , taking hold of my arm . " Let them dance . " I pulled my arm away from him and said , indicating the soldier with the crutch . " You want to dance with this soldier , Gerry ? " " Sure , Eddie . There 's plenty time . " " Never mind , " Miller said . " Pm gon na dance . How about dancing with me ? " " I 'll dance with both of you , " Gerry said . M ILLER had left his chair and was standing with the other two in front of us . Gerry and I were turned in our chairs facing them , with our backs to the bar . " I did n't mean that . I mean the boy friend . How about dancing with me ? " he asked , tapping my shoe with his cane . I smiled , taking the joke . " No , thanks . " " Come on , you dance with me and Bugs here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bugs , the soldier with the crutch and the bad arm , grinned , and the soldier with the empty sleeve had a wise smile on his face . I kept up the game and said , " Thanks , kid , but you 're not my type . I go for redheads . " " Do n't be funny , " he snapped , and he was looking hard at me . " I mean dance . You know ? ' Dance . ' Come on outside in the street and you and I will have a little dance . " I still did n't catch it , but in another second I knew it was a way he had of saying that he wanted to take me on in a fight . That was enough for me to know we had to leave right away , and I stood up to go . " Come on , Gerry , we have to get going . " " Wait a minute , " Miller said , stepping up to me. " what about that dance ? " " Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got you right , but this sounds like you want a fight . Is that it ? " " Sure , that 's right . You leave now without the girl and I 'll follow you out . " " Do n't be a damned fool . " I turned to his friends . " You 'd better take care of your buddy here . I think he 's had a little too much to drink . " The other soldiers answered by moving to Miller 's side to stand with him . Gerry was sitting quietly with her drink , watching us . " You 're a phony . " Miller said . I did n't answer him and I moved my head at Gerry to show her I wanted her to come along with me . She made no move to leave the chair . " You 're a jerk . Is n't he a jerk ? " he asked the soldiers . They did n't say anything and they kept looking at me , their faces hard . " I think you 're a big phony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big phony you are . " He poked me a little sharply in the arm with his cane . " Take it easy with the cane , " I said . " Come on , Gerry , let 's go . " I turned to help her from the chair and as soon as I looked away from Miller I heard the cane whistle down close by the back of my head . I swung back toward the soldiers and they were laughing at me . " I told you to take it easy with that cane . " Miller raised the cane again and I do n't know if he wanted just to whip it close to me again or do some damage with it , but I put out my hand and caught it before he brought it down . He twisted at me to pull the cane back and fell against me . He got the cane loose and as I pushed his shoulders away from me he started to bring the cane down once more . Before it could land I hit him in the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HE blow had no more in it than a sharp slap  --  I had n't wanted it to be even that much  --  but it had been enough to tip him off his crippled balance . He was n't hurt and he was on his way to getting up from the floor . I leaned over to help him , but his friends got to him quicker , and already , in the commotion the row had stirred up around the bar , I was being held back by the bartender  --  Georgeand Ralph , the assistant manager . " Take it easy , " Ralph said to me . " Let him alone . " " I was just going to help him up . " " You helped him enough already . What 's the matter with you , Eddie ? " Miller was on his feet now and he and his friends were standing together before us . " Turn the bastard over to us , Ralph . We 'll beat the spit out of him . " " That 's all right , boys . We do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you , anyway , Eddie ? I thought you could handle your liquor . " I said as calmly as I could , " Nothing 's wrong , Ralph . An accident , that 's all . " " Accident , hell , " Miller said . " All right , then . They were bothering my girl and this soldier was trying to use his cane on me . I did n't hurt him . " Ralph turned to Gerry , who had left her seat during the fight . " Is that right ? Were these soldiers bothering you ? " " No , " she said , looking at me and then at the soldiers . " No , they were n't bothering me . " " What 's wrong with you , anyway ? " Ralph said to me . " You better leave , Eddie . You 'll be starting more trouble . " " That 's all right with me , " I said . " Come on , let us at the bastard , " one of the soldiers said . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or I 'll call the cop in again . He 's going to leave . Come on , Eddie , Iet 's go , " Ralph said , giving me a gentle shove toward the door . " Okay if you say so , Ralph . All set , Gerry ? " She did n't answer me . " Come on , we have to get out of here . " " You do . I do n't have to . " She paused and looked at the soldiers . " I want to stay around here a little longer . I 'm going to stay . " When she said that the soldiers moved over with her to the bar . I was n't going to hang around arguing with her , and anyway I did n't have any choice about staying long enough for anything like that , so I let it go and started to leave . I did have a feeling that I could have gone over and told Miller I was sorry if I 'd hurt him , but he and his friends were busy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks coming up , and when I saw Gerry take a bill from her purse I walked right out .
