With the authority of one of the Allies ' two greatest fighting leaders , in a fighter 's forthright style , Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek last week told Britain to quit stalling on the subject of India 's political freedom . The Gissimo was still visiting in India ( TIME , Feb. 23 ) , where he had just talked with Mohandas Gandhi , but his words sounded to faraway London like a thunderclap . <P> I hope Britain , without waiting for any demand on the part of the Indian people , as speedily as possible will give them real political power so they will be in a position to develop further their spiritual and material strength . The Indian people thus would realize that their participation in the war was not merely to aid anti-aggression nations to secure victory , but also the turning point in their struggle for their own freedom . <P> These were the words of a man who does not propose to fight for white men 's imperialism . He is not a white man himself . He has fought Japan for four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 425,000,000 yellow men . Now that he finds his cause involved in a desperate world war , he wants the full alliance of India 's 352,000,000 brown men . <P> His talk with the most remarkable of them all could only have strengthened his desire . He met Mohandas Gandhi shortly after noon in the marbled and gilded Calcutta mansion of Gandhi 's rich cotton-milling backer , Ghanshyamdas Birla . Throughout the conversations , Gandhi spun yarn on a charkha ( hand spinning wheel ) . He talked with the Gissimo through an interpreter , with vivid Mme. Chiang in English . After 80 minutes the Chinese visitors dined , while the Mohandas , as usual , abstained from mid-day eating . The conference continued through Gandhi 's evening meal of unleavened cakes , boiled vegetables , goat 's milk and fruit . Gandhi gave the yarn he had spun to the Gissimo , the charkha to Mme. Chiang . <P> Action . The Gissimo 's resounding statement on India pumped electricity into India 's two greatest political parties , Gandhi 's Indian National Congress and the Moslem League . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru , at once passed a resolution asking Britain to declare India 's position " identical with those of other self-governing units of the British Commonwealth . " <P> In London there were immediate hints that the British Government had understood , as well as heard , the Gissimo . Official circles were loud with rumors that Winston Churchill , who was at last paying considerable attention to his critics ( see p. 27 ) , would shortly move to increase India 's autonomy . That was a job which , owing to the Hindu-Moslem conflict in India , as well as to Tory opposition at home , would call for real statesmanship . But , after the Gissimo 's words , it seemed that Britain might tackle the job . <P> Asia for the Asiatics . Throughout the democratic world , in fact , there was a growing appreciation of the point of view eloquently expressed last week by U.S. Pundit Walter Lippmann :
