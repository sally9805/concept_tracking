Dr. Watson often tried to deduce a man 's occupation from his appearance , but Sherlock Holmes almost always had to set him right . Police medical examiners who lack Holmes 's deductive powers but must often try to determine the occupation of a person brought in dead , unconscious , amnesic or deliberately lying can get some ideas from a guide published in the Journal of the American Medical Association last week by Dr. Francesco Ronchese of Providence , R. I. and Boston University . <P> Some of his tips : <P> A callus at the base of the left little finger indicates a stone cutter , who braces his chisel with his little finger . Other characteristic calluses : the house painter 's on the front of both shins where he leans on his ladder ; the trumpet or tuba player 's near the tip of the right little finger , where the finger presses against a small hook to steady the instrument ; the writer 's ( or student 's or bookkeeper 's ) on the side of the right middle finger ; the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the floor sweeper 's at the base of both thumbs ; the gardener 's on the knuckles of his left hand which he uses to brace himself as he weeds with his right . <P> Some telltale sores : the violin player 's on the left side of the jaw ; the optical glass molder 's burn sores and scars on knuckles and arms ; milkers ' nodules which farmers sometimes get on their hands . <P> The cauliflower ear of the prize fighter is well known . Less familiar are the banged-up " dealer shins " of the junk dealer , garbage collector , truck driver , foundry worker . <P> Silversmiths may absorb so much silver that their skin becomes slate grey . " Canary " is the name for an explosive-powder worker whose hair and skin have become red-yellow from tetryl . A foundry worker often has red-streaked forearms . <P> A man whose bald head shows scars of crusted ringworm suffered during his youth Dr. Ronchese suspects of being a European , because that type of ringworm is prevalent among Europe 's poorer classes but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aleppo or Jericho boil is probably an Armenian , because the disease rarely occurs outside of Asia Minor and is most common in Armenia . An old man scarred by bites of the body louse ( vagabond 's disease ) is probably a tramp . <P> Fingerprints are sometimes temporarily obliterated , even without surgery : e.g. , the fingertips of a bricklayer 's left hand are usually smooth as glass .
