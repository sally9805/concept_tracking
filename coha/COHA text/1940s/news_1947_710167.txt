Justice Stanley Reed , deliverine , a majority opinion , said , h the Federal erdpinyea that it Was withili the ' of Conk-test to regulate . what it deemed evils of politicat activity , as long as the sight of the individual in casting his vote was not infringed upon . The Hatch act , sad the court 's opinion , did not step beyond this scope . In the State rights case , brought by Oklahoma , the court ruled th011 while the Federal Government could not regulate local political activities of State employes , it Could attach any conditions it wished to grants in aid . The case involved an Oklahoma Highway Commissioner , who , the Civil Service Commission found , had also served for a time as Democratic State chairman . CIO Union Brought One Case The decision affecting Federal amployes was on a case brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in behalf of twelve ? . mployes , including George P. ? oole , a roller in the United States Hint in Philadelphia . The Civil service Commission ruled that ? oole had violated the act by servng also as a Democratic ward executive committeeman , and by working at the polls on election lay , Nov. 5 , 1940 . The majority of the justices uled that none of the eleven other ; mployes had actually violated provisions of the act to which the ienalty of dismissal is attached . I The division of the court in this 1 ; ase was not precise . Justice Hugo 4 . , Black wrote a dissent in which ? ustice Wiley Rutledge joined in prart . Justice William 0 . Douglas // also wrote a dissent , disagreeing " in part " with the majority . Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote an opinion concurring with the majortiy . Justices Frank Murphy and Robert H. Jackson did not participate . The CIO union contended that the sentence in the Hatch act forbidding Federal employes from taking " any active part in political management or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of free speech , and other guarantees . Majority Rejects This View The court majority disagreed , Justice Reed stating that the Hatch act " forbids only the partisan activity of Federal personnel deemed offensive to efficiency . " The act " leaves untouched full participation by employes in political decisions at the ballot box , " he added . Justice Reed aid it was to be passumed that " the teaching of exerience " had led Congress to enact the Hatch measure , popularly known as the " clean politics " act . He added ; " Congress is not I politically naive . " " To declare that the present supposed evils of political activity are beyond the power of Congress to redress would leave the nation impotent to deal with what many sincere men believe is a material threat to the democratic system , " continued Justice Reed 's opinion . " When actions of civil servants in the judgment of Congress menace the integrity and competency of the service , legislation to forestall such danger and adequate to maintain its usefulness is required . The Hatch act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not say that these restrictions ' are unconstitutional . " Justice Black said in dissent that the majority 's decision upheld a statute that went far beyond precedent " to stifle the spoken and written political utterances and lawful political activities of Federal and State employes as a class . " Noting the contention that the , Hatch Act was in the interest of " clean politics , " Mr. Black added ' " it would hardly seem to be imperative to muzzle millions of citizens because some of them , if left to their constitutional freedoms , might corrupt the political process . " Millions " Mere Spectators " He contended that the majority 's ruling " reduces the Constitutionality protected liberty of several million citizens to . less than a shadow of its substance . " " It relegates millions of Federal , State and municipal employes to the role of mere spectators of events upon which hinge the safety and welfare of all the people , including public employes , " continued Mr. Black . " It makes honest participation in essential political activities an offense punishable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leis partial dissent stressed Poole 's status as an industrial employe , which placed him outside the administrative category of Civil Service . As such , according to Justice Douglas , Poole was far removed from contact with the public or from policy making . " To sacrifice the political rights of the industrial workers goes far beyond any demonstrated or demonstrable need , " said Mr. Douglas , speaking of the " political sterilization " of these employes . The high court 's decision upheld a special three-judge United States court for the District of Columbia . Oklahoma Was Penalized The decision relating to State employes was on a challenge by Oklahoma after the Federal Goven.ment had penalized the State $10,800 in Federal road aid funds . This amount represented two years ' salary for France Paris , whom the Civil Service Commission found had served for a time as State Democratic Chairman while he was also State Highway Commissioner . Paris resigned his party affiliation when Civil Service proceedings against him were begun . Nevertheless the commission ordered him removed from the highway position as well , and assessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The State argued that the Federal Government had no right to interfere in Oklahoma 's internal affairs , and that enforcement of the Hatch Act in the Paris case violated the State 's prerogatives . Justice Reed , delivering the court 's 5-2 opinion , agreed that the United States had no power to regulate local political activities of State officials , but stated that the Federal Government could " fix the terms upon which its money allotments to States shall be disbursed . " ? The court agreed with the apeals court finding that " manifestly , the ( Civil Service ) Commission had s lid footing in the Act for the conclusion that removal of Paris from office was warranted . " It was pointed out , however , that while the Civil Service Commission " ordered " Paris ' removal from office , State authorities refused to oust him . He resigned as Highway Commissioner later to accept another appointment by Governor Robert S. Kerr . Thus , the Court concluded there was no actual violation of Oklahoma 's sovereignty .
