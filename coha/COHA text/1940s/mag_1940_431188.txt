" AM I following too closely behind that car ? Would it be safe to try to pass him now ? " How often , while driving , have you asked yourself those questions ? The accuracy of your split-second decision may mean the difference between safety and a disastrous wreck . Here is a simple " range finder " that you can make and put on your windshield to help you estimate distances and cultivate sure-fire judgment . Passing a slower car on the road , when another car is coming toward you , calls for accurate judgment . It is a matter of split-second timing . Meeting at a mile a minute each , cars eat up the distance between them at the rate of 176 feet a second . If a driver going sixty miles an hour attempts to go around a car going forty , the swing-out , the passing , and the swing-back will take seven and one half seconds , even though the swing-out is started only 100 feet behind and the cut-in is completed 100 feet ahead of the slower car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars will have traveled 1,320 feet toward each other . In other words , if a driver travels at sixty miles an hour , he must have a quarter of a mile of clear road ahead before it is safe to try to pass a slower car . It is reasonable to expect a sixty-mile-an-hour speed in the cars that come toward you on the roads outside the cities . At slower speeds , the danger is proportionately less . Curves , hills , and night driving cause most head-on collisions , because many drivers attempt to pass at times and places where  | they can not see far enough ahead to be sure they have room to use the left lane before an approaching car is upon them . To give the driver a means of judging whether he lacks that necessary quarter mile of clear road is a purely mechanical problem . The farther away an object is , the smaller it appears . In fact , we estimate how far distant an object is by noticing how large it looks . This use of perspective is the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell you when it is safe to pass the slower car ahead . The " danger meter " is simply two concentric circles drawn upon celluloid and affixed to the windshield directly ahead of the driver with cellulose tape . As the driver travels along the highway , the scene ahead appears as shown in the illustrations . When he wants to pass the car ahead , a quick glance through the " danger meter " tells him if danger is too close to risk passing . If the edges of the road ahead at the farthest visible point lie outside the rim of the small circle , the driver is too close to a curve or a hill to take a chance on passing . Likewise , even though the " danger meter " shows the road ahead at a point so far away that the edges of the road appear to lie well inside the small circle , there still may be  | danger . If there are approaching cars between the driver and the farthest visible point , it is obvious that it is not safe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fully visible between the driver and the farthest point of the road in sight . If there is a sharp dip ahead , it may hide an approaching car . The larger circle is designed to tell the driver when he is following another car too closely . If the car ahead , when sighted through the " danger meter , " appears larger than the large circle , the driver is following too closely for safety if the car ahead should stop suddenly . When the driver stays far enough behind so that the car ahead appears completely within the large circle , there will be a safe stopping distance between the driver 's car and the car ahead . The " danger meter " is designed for quarter-mile visibility for passing and for an even 100-foot clearance in following another car . To make one for your car , take a two-inch square of clear celluloid . Have a friend measure the distance from your eyes to the windshield at a point directly in line with your eyes when you sit comfortably behind the wheel . This distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you , from Table " B , " how large to make the large circle , while table " C " will tell you what size to make the small circle , Both circles should be drawn using the same center , both should be made with black Ind:a ink . The inner circle tells whether you have a clear road for passing the outer circle tells whether you are allowing a safe distance between you and the car ahead . The small variation for eye distance shows that the accuracy of the " danger meter " is not vitally affected by the driver 's shifting forward and back in his seat . Do not use the " danger meter " as a gun sight . Staring through it might cause you to fail to see dangers approaching from the side . Merely glance through it quickly to apraise your position . At other times it is so inconspicuous that it will in no way interfere with your vision . Being transparent , it does not violate state laws that Drohibit stickers on the windshield . Many head-on collisions occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective at such times as in ordinary daytime driving . Proper use of the " danger meter " will give you a sense of security when you drive . Two or three weeks ' use of it will educate you into an accurate concept of distance judgment . Head-on collisions can be reduced when drivers know when and where it is dangerous to overtake and pass .  |
