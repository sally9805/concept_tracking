' ' You drove through heavy waves of sweet-smelling air where hundreds of dead Germans , pocketed in mountain hideouts , had been pulverized by the artillery barrage . Whole hillsides were reduced to rubble . The crests of the rocky knolls strung out along the entire breadth of the Gothic Line were sprayed with dead Germans wiped out by long-range artillery and bypassed by hard-pushing infantry . " <P> Thus TIME Correspondent Tom Durrance described a drive through Futa Pass , following Fifth Army troops driving downhill to Bologna . <P> Two days before , after a month 's battering , Canadians , British , Indians and Greeks of the Eighth Army broke the Gothic Line at its Adriatic end . There in heavy rain they had taken Rimini , where modern Italians bathed on hot summer days . Now it was a dismal memory of a town ; ( still erect were the gallows where partisans were hanged the week-before ) , opening the way into the flat plains behind the Gothic Line . <P> Yet now the capture of Rimini was no longer important . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way across the Apennines in ten days of as rough fighting as any at Cassino , had really wrecked the Line . From the foothills above Bologna they were only 80 miles across the plain from Verona and Padua . The German troops retiring from Rimini , on the eastern end of the Gothic Line , and those holding the western end of the Line near La Spezia now had to race northward or be cut off , for Verona and Padua are their only ways out . <P> The Germans lost 10,000 prisoners . Five of their divisions were badly mauled . The Po River offered a possible defense line , but rivers through broad plains do not compare in strength with mountains , especially if the attacker has overwhelming air power . For Field Marshal Albert Kesselring the end of his long , skillful campaign in Italy was now in sight . The only possible salvage still open to him was to withdraw his small army successfully to the fierce crags of the Dolomites , which form a better defense line than any he has held heretofore . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep General Sir Harold Alexander from penetrating into Austria . But then Milan , Turin , Genoa , the whole Po Valley would have to be abandoned . And the war in Italy would be over . <P> Cheerful , green-uniformed soldiers of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force , fighting on the western end of the Allied line in Italy , completed their first weeks under fire with gains of four to eight miles , capture of several towns and some prisoners .
