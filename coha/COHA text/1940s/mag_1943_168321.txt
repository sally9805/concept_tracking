Stern , silent President Juan Antonio Ros of Chile has been faced since his election in February 1942 with a chronic political crisis . His problem : to appease refractory , quarreling politicians of nine parties who can not agree among themselves on what they want . His solutions : recurrent Cabinet reshuffles . His results : none . <P> Last week President Ros tried again . Out went seven members of the tecnico Cabinet which he formed three months ago in the hope that it would bring the politicians into line . In came the party men again , five Radicals , two Liberals . Most of the new Cabinet members had been seen before . The people knew them and were skeptical . The parties knew them and remained dissatisfied . The President knew them but maintained that this time the Cabinet " must devote itself exclusively to the welfare of the country . Political incidents may take place , but they must be disregarded .
