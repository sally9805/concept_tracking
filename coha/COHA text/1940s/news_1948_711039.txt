txt I often had occasion to see the President in the early morning , when he was still in bed . Nually he had already been up . eaten breakfast and returned to bed to conduct the first business of the day . I found his bed strewn with newspapers , documents , letters and telegrams . I pulled up a chair near by and we began to discuss the question at hand . This practice continued throughout the years I was at the State Department . In general , I was not a social intimate of the President . I was not invited to White House dinners , except on official occasions , or to week-end excursions on Mr. Roosevelt 's yacht or to visit Hyde Park . Mr. Roosevelt respected my determination not to dissipate my energies in social affairs but to conserve them for the events of my office . Moreover , I was frankly glad not to be invited into the White House groups where so often the " liberal ' game was played on an extreme basis .

Mrs. Franklin Roosevelt was further to the left than I was , and my contacts with her were very limited , though sufficient to enable me to appreciate her ability . She was a valiant fighter for the organization of peace and developed a wide influence in the United States and other countries for peace and other humanitarian causes . I am convinced that the President was completely frank with me . Although I did not attend his purely military conferences unless the question was also one involving foreign affairs ? or do'inestic conferences , I never asked him a question about the most secret military or domestic situation that he did not instantly and unreservedly respond with full information . Several of our Ambassadors , particularly Bullitt in Moscow and later Paris , Kennedy in London and Davies in Moscow and later Brussels , who were old friends of his , had the habit of writing // These memoirs were written by the Secretary of State who held office during the crucial period from March 4 , 1933 , to Nov. 30 , 1944 .

Of far more importance to . me were the pleasant , quiet luncheons I had alone with the President on scores of occasions , when for an hour at least we could exchange shirtsleeve opinions without the necessity to guard every word and watch every comma . My relations with the President 's mother , Mrs. Sarah Delano Roosevelt , were most cordial . In my opinion she was a remarkable woman , who had consecrated her all to her son and her country . I. first learned to know of her through the information brought to me that she was frequently supporting me ' and my public views .

While it is always inadvisable for AmIbassadors and Ministers to carry on a correspondence with the President which includes discussion of important questions of policy  --  a fact I deprecated in my talks with Mr. Roosevelt  --  I do not . recall any instance of any consequence in which the views and course of the State Department were seriously interfered with by this practice . Disturbed by Personal Envoys The President pursued one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sending special envoys abroad as his personal representatives to talk with the heads of foreign Governments or to perform certain missions . Among them were Harry Hopkins , Henry Wallace , W. Averell Harriman , Patrick J. Hurley , William J. Donovan and Joseph E. Davies , all of whom went on one or more missions . Sending these special envoys tended in many instances to create havoc with our Ambassadors or Ministers in the capitals they visited . Nevertheless their missions rarely interfered with the strictly diplomatic efforts of the Government . The President and I conferred with regard to the appointment of my immediate assistants in the State Department and of our Ambassadors and Ministers abroad . As time went on , the President made a number of suggestions for such appointments ; but in a good majority of instances the State Department made recommendations to him , and in due course he acted upon them favorably , with some exceptions . His own suggestions came to me in laconic , penciled or penned notes on small sheets of White House stationery . Undated , they would read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris " Bring Brown home After Turkey moved her capital from Istanbul to Ankara , I got this penned note from him : " C. H.

" Before Mr. Roosevelt became President , I always called him " Franklin . " Afterwards I called him " Mr. President " because , for one reason , when I saw him he was so often with other people . But even when we were alone I addressed him as " Mr. President , " although we had few occasions to use titles . He always called me " Cordell " both before and after becoming President . The President visited the State Department only once . He came to the Department after hours to look over offices on an upper floor to be used by some of his ' anonymous assistants .

But the President 's and Hoover 's relations had become embittered , with the result that the former never invited the latter to the White House . I myself conferred with Hoover informally a number of times , though not officially at the State Department . Our conversations took place , on Hoover 's suggestion , at the home of former Under-Secretary of State William Castle , and I reported on them to the President . Hoover manifested the liveliest interest in public affairs . As to whether his extreme hostility toward Roosevelt gave a more bitter tinge to his partisanship I could not say . At any rate , it was a two-way hostility . Some of the extreme left-fringe people kept the President stirred up from time to time about the State Department .

Apart from complaining now and then about a " leak " in the Department , he never made a remark to me about " hating " the State Department , as one or two persons have later alleged .

A Churchill ProblemHe sent me a note on Dec. a61 , 1943 , nearly eleven years after I entered the State Department , which is worth quoting . " I am sending you herewith a copy of a memorandum I sent to Churchill . This was a note to accompany a memorandum I had sent the President concerning the Free French Committee in relation to Italy .

I did not find as much discussion of foreign relations at Cabinet meetings as might be supposed . I was often reticent about disclosing important secrets to the Cabinet because there were leaks of such information to favorite news writers or broadcasters . Such leaks were restricted to a very few Cabinet members , according to my best information . Certain Cabinet members undertook from ' time to time to infringe on the jurisdiction and functions of another or other members . This became very disagreeable to me on several later occasions , such as when an embargo on exports to Japan was under discussion , and , when Henry Wallace 's Board of Economic Warfare sought to appropriate the chief economic war , functions of the State Department and other agencies . Under my policy of keeping foreign affairs out of domestic poll ' tics , and under the President 's policy of dealing himself with both Idomestic and purely military affairs , it was but natural that I would not become so intimately associated with the President personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs who were in constant conference with him on the almost innumerable questions arising .

Roosevelt when they sought teinterfere , in the name of the President or otherwise , in the work of other departments . Paradoxically , two or three Cabinet members , along with certain White House attaches , would sometimes attack a policy of the State Department , always in the name of the President , while at that very time the President and I were working closely together in harmony . This was one of the disagreeable experiences some of us Cabinet members had to undergo . The . President was delightful and interesting in these Cabinet meetings . His pleasing personality made itself felt in full . He liked anecdotes and enjoyed telling them . He was almost always in good spirits and talked with ease and pleasure .

Mr. President , just before I came over for the meeting today some newspaper men met me at the State Department and said to me : " Mr. Secretary , there 's a rumor going about that the White House food is very poor .
