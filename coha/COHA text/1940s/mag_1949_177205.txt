The Communists were not the only ones who could wage successful rebellion in Asia . Last week Karen tribesmen , mostly Baptist , held much of Burma 's richest land . They had taken Mandalay , and were in control of the Irrawaddy valley ; their guns ringed the capital , Rangoon . Two months ago whole regiments of Karens rose in open rebellion against the government . The tough hill tribesmen , led by a handsome ex-Rangoon lawyer , Saw Ba U Gyi , had grown tired of waiting for the infant Burma Union to grant their demand for a separate state . They planned their attack for a propitious time , and then they struck . <P> The Karens number only 1,500,000 of Burma 's 17 million , but their hard-hitting troops terrify the Burmans . Trained by the British as anti-Japanese guerrilla units , the Karens are the best-equipped , best-officered group in the battle royal which has been raging for control of Burma ( see map ) . The Karens ' rivals include : 1 ) the government , which holds a few beleaguered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; 2 ) the Red Flag ( Trotskyite ) Communists ; 3 ) the White Flag ( Stalinist ) Communists ; and 4 ) the White Band ( People 's Volunteer Organization ) , followers of assassinated Premier Aung San ( TIME , July 28 , 1947 ) . Recently the P.V.O. has shown signs that it was willing to cooperate with the government . Government officials show up regularly at the Rangoon Turf Club to instill public confidence , badly shaken by the sound of gunfire from the Insein front ten miles away . Last week racegoers gossiped hopefully of the current visit of P.V.O. General Bo La Yaung ( his name means " Officer Moonshine " ) to the government 's army chief , Bo Ne Win ( " Officer Sunshine " ) , who rarely misses a Sunday at the track . <P> Even wholehearted P.V.O. assistance may be too late for Burma 's tottering government . A recent government amnesty offer has brought in only a handful of Karens . Said one dour Burman official , " It looks as if the Karens want all Burma for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Irrawaddy had cut off rice shipments from Rangoon . The bankrupt government hoped anxiously for a 25 million British loan ( $100 million ) . In London , talk revived that Burma , after 15 months of chaotic independence , would apply for readmission to the British Commonwealth . In Rangoon , Premier Thakin Nu had moved into a thatched hut behind his house , and taken a vow of chastity ( he has eight children ) . Thakin Nu 's friends said that he was devoting himself to becoming a Buddha 999 worlds from now . Recently , Thakin Nu and thousands of other residents &lt;of besieged Rangoon went to the famed Shwe Dagon Pagoda in observance of Taboung , the lunar year-end festival which comes with the March full moon . A photographer circling around him disturbed Thakin Nu 's prayers . The Premier looked up at him , grinned , and said in crisp English : " Let 's swap jobs . " <P>
