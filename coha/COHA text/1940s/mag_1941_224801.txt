Greenwich Village 's American Contemporary Artists Gallery nestles like a hayloft hideaway in the eaves of the Village Barn cabaret . There last week William Cropper , U. S. leftism 's No. 1 painter , gave his annual one-man show . A persistent sapper and gnawer at the roots of capitalism ( for years the ace cartoonist of the old Liberator , the newer New Masses ) , Painter Gropper turns out each year some 50 oils , countless lithographs and drawings of fat capitalists , hungry workers , woe-heeled sharecroppers , bashed and bleeding soldiers . His highly-colored , savagely-drawn pictures have drawn praises and commissions from many a bourgeois . ( Art-loving capitalists buy his canvases like hot cakes at $750 up . ) Today Leftist Gropper ( once an errand boy in a clothing store ) lives in a nine-room stone house ( " bourgeois as hell " ) in Croton-on-Hudson , drives a big Chrysler car . <P> This year Bill Gropper , who has never seen the horrors of war , capitalist or otherwise , but likes to depict them , had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show 's 25 oils and 19 lithographs , a large number showed concentration camps , corpse-strewn battlefields , bayonetings , bombed civilians , etc . Bill Gropper gets his scenes of carnage partly out of his round head , partly from reading papers . Says he : " I have never seen war , but did Leonardo ever see the Last Supper ? " <P> The Art News , oldest U. S. magazine devoted to art , last week , with a new choir of angels , became a thick bi-weekly instead of a thin weekly , reduced its annual subscription from $7 to $4.50 . Among its new backers : International Business Machines President Thomas J. Watson , Marshall Field III , archangel of the New York tabloid PM.
