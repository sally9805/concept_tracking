California 's American-Hawaiian Steamship Co. ( the " AH Line " ) had a new president last week . But the name was old and familiar . Lewis A. Lapham , 38 , is the lean , twinkling son of San Francisco 's tubby , twinkling Mayor Roger Lapham ( TIME , July 15 ) and grandson and great-nephew of Lewis H. Lapham and George S. Dearborn . Starting with a fleet of windjammers , his grandfather and Dearborn had built A-H into the biggest U.S. intercoastal steamship line . New President Lapham knew that his job was no sinecure : " I 'm being thrown off the dock to see if I can swim . " West Coast shipping men were betting that he could . <P> When Lewis Lapham came home to San Francisco after Hotchkiss and Yale ( " I 'm one of those mass-produced guys " ) , he was n't interested in working for his father , then A-H 's president . Instead , he wrote a shipping column for Hearst 's Examiner , learned about the waterfront and gained a reputation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he went to work for A-H and was lent to the Waterfront Employers Association . Shippers think that he had a lot to do with improving labor relations . During the war , when ulcers kept him out of uniform , he ranged the Pacific , unscrambling shipping problems . When A-H 's President John E. Gushing decided to move over to the Matson Navigation Co. a month ago , Lapham was the logical choice to replace him . <P> The line is long on cash ( over $19 million liquid assets ) and prestige , short on ships , and uncertain about the future . Before the war it confined itself to the coastal trade ( the Hawaiian run was abandoned in 1917 ) . But the war set it to operating War Shipping Administration ships all over the world . Now , with operating costs up 100% , A-H does not see how it can go back to coastal runs at present ICC-fixed rates . It is operating twelve vessels for the Maritime Commission . But this service may stop next July . <P> The six ships A-H @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently sailing with no set routes to ports in Europe , Africa and Asia . Lewis Lapham would like to get the line back to operating its own ships on regular schedules . But he plans to wait until the pattern of postwar trade is clear and the U.S. Government decides about subsidies .
