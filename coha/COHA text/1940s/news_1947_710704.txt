txt The manifestations of an approaching new crisis in Western Europe are to be seen in that phenomenon of which the world has heard so much in recent months , a steady seepage of dollars . Italy , it is reported , will have exhausted its dollar exchange by the end of 1947 . The last of the proceeds of the World Bank loan made to France in May will have been expended at about the same time . And Britain , near the bottom of the barrel , so far as last year 's American credit of $3.75 billions is concerned , is running through dollars at a rate of $40 millions a week . We have used the term " manifestations " rather than the term " problem " deliberately , because the actual nature of Europe 's plight  --  even on the assumption that it is a general problem , rather than a numj , er of individual problems  --  is a subject on which there is room for a wide range of debate . The public should , however , have a clearer idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has now . The sixteen-nation conference which has been meeting in Paris under the Marshall Plan has completed its stock-taking and is expected to report , about Sept. 15 , on ( 1 ) what the dimensions are of Europe 's needs and ( 2 ) what plans the nations embraced by the Plan have for contributing to the solution of their own difficulties . Thus far the American people , who are being asked to underwrite this joint effort in European recovery , have heard too much about the former and not enough about the latter . It is not unnatural that they should be asking : " How is it that Europe was made a going concern within a few years after the First World War with the aid of loans which were ' small change ' beside those which this country is being called upon to make at the present time ? " We all know , of course , that there are certain profound differences between the two situations . For one thing , the Second World War was a far bigger war than its predecessor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no recalcitrant and powerful Soviet Union to deal with on the former occasion , hence the world was able to return quickly to the ways of peace , military and political . But although these circumstances may go far to explain the chronic " dollar shortages " of , say , Britain , France and Italy , they hardly explain the existence of the same phenomenon in countries untouched by the war , such for example , as our next-door neighbor Mexico . There has been , we believe , an exaggerated tendency to take for granted that the problems of Europe are a consequence in their entirety of dislocations caused by the war , rather than , in part at least , of ill-advised postwar policies . If the Paris Conference faced one task more important than any other , it was the task of making this difficult but important distinction . The American public is entitled to know whether the problems of any given country embraced in the Marshall Plan stem from the war itself or from needless under-production. , overevaluation of the currency , or chronically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If there are two countries which , economically and financially , may be said to represent twin keys to the recovery of Western Europe , these are Germany and Great Britain . Until the London Conference on the Level of German Production acted to alter the situation a few weeks ago , Germany was exporting only 5.8 million tons of steel  --  not because that was the best that it could do , but because that was what the " plan " of the occupying countries called for . The figure has now been raised to 10. ? million tons , which is more than sufficient to pay for the food which Germany must import . That is how " dollar shortages " are corrected . Britain 's balance of payments suffered catastrophically as a result of tha war . She was running an average annual deficit even before that of $170 millions . But in financing her part of the effort , although she wax the beneficiary of Lend-Lease from the United States and " mutual aid " from Canada in the amount of $23.6 billions , she found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign assets and to assume an external debt of $12 billions . There can be no gainsaying , therefore , that wartime dislocations are basically responsible for the fact that Britain 's deficit had risen by 1946 to $1.6 billions . Unfortuntely , it is by no means possible to justify similarly the further rise in the deficit since 1946 to a rate of approximately $2.4 billions . Britain 's 1947 dollar crisis is , in the main , a manmade crisis . We need not look beyond the present news headlines to realize that this is so . The spectacle of 50,000 miners voluntarily out of work , 250,000 tons of coal  --  Britain 's most vital product  --  lost , and stoppages threatened in the steel and textile industries at this critical juncture in the world 's affairs because of a walk-out of 140 miners in a single colliery is all the evidence one needs to realize that here we are in the presence of something new and incredible even for the astonishing era of John L. Lewis . Under the Marshall Plan each participating nation will be expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce . In the case of England this clearly can mean only one thing  --  coal . Unless the Labor Government can demonstrate its ability to get coal mined it is difficult to believe that the Marshall Plan will produce the enthusiasm and the hope which it merits and which are so essential to its success . Messrs . Attlee , Bevin et al have made much in recent months of " the spirit of Dunkirk . " Sooner or later they will have to demonstrate , not with figures of speech , but by their own actions , whether it is to be the spirit of Dunkirk or the spirit of Grimethorpe .
