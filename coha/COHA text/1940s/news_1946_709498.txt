txt Conditions in British prisoner of war camps in Belgium , where more than 100,000 German officers and soldiers still arc being held , will be probed hi the house of commons Tuesday . Secretary for War J. J. Lawson will he asked to state how many Germans arc detained in these camps and how many of them have died since the camps were opened last autumn . It is expected that the questions will lead to a war office inquiry into conditions in the camps , which are described by British officers who visited-them as " not much better than Belson . " During the winter 194,000 Germans were crowded into these camps , Of these , 30,000 were sent to work in the Belgian coal mines , and the total number now held is about 130,000 .

Each , hnuses thousands of prisoners , many of whom arc classed as " politically trustworthy ' , " after special training in " reeducation camps " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept on the bare ground with only one blanket each . They say they are underfed and beaten and kicked by the guards . Many have no underclothes or boots . In another camp at Zedelghem , near Bruges , are 700 German generals , admirals , and colonels described by British visitors as " so old and broken as to be long past further mischief . " Of 75,000 ' irisoilers ill the Brussels area , only 5,000 are working . The rest , observers say , are " just rotting . " Show Starving Symptoms Ordinary prisoners get 2,000 cal()ries of food per day and the SS Men 1,500 . Older men and men reduced by illness could not manage on this diet and many showed symptoms of starvation . There are as many as six deaths per day in some camps .

Faced with these charges , a war office spokesman said today : " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been desperately short . Many of our own men spent the winter tut- , der canvas , too . " fie added that if reports of mistreatment are proved , offenders would be punished .
