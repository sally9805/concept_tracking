A five-year-old boy lay in bed burning with fever , his right groin swollen . Suspecting that this was no ordinary disease , his doctor took a sample of fluid from the swollen gland , started home to examine it . But near the house he saw something that confirmed his terrible suspicions : a batch of dead squirrels . <P> The boy had the plague-the same Black Death that swept over Europe in the 14th Century , killing a fourth of the population . This case occurred in California last month . The boy caught the disease from fleas which carried the plague bacilli ( Pasteurella pestis ) from sick squirrels . No effective treatment for plague is known , and the boy died in three days . <P> Although this was only the second case of plague in the U.S. this year , the U.S. Public Health Service was so alarmed that Surgeon General Thomas Parran called a meeting of anti-plague workers in Salt Lake City last week . <P> Only 500 cases of plague have been reported in the U.S. since 1900 . These were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , said health officers last week , the disease has been smoldering for years in ground squirrels , rats , rabbits , other rodents . From the coast the plague is slowly moving east . If the disease should be passed from country rats to city rats , there would be danger of great epidemics . <P> The plague is spread in two ways : 1 ) by fleas ; 2 ) by the sneezes of victims who suffer from the " pneumonic " form of the disease . To combat it , the conference last week asked for a Government expenditure of $1,800,000 , mostly for a war on rodents .
