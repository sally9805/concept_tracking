txt Waste of Cardboard Protested The current publicity regarding waste paper salvage leads me to write that for two years I have been trying to get my laundries to stop putting cardboard in the bosoms and under the collars of my shirts . This practice has always seemed to me to be a real waste , not only of cardboard but of time . The paper has to be put into the shirt , I have to take it out , put it aside , tie it up when I get a lot of L and put it on the street . The collector has to pick it up , put it on a truck , cart It away . What a tremendous saving if all these steps could be eliminated , and that cardboard used for shell cases and other essentials . Besides , so far as I can see , the cardboard does nothing to hold the collars in shape . JOSEPH GALVIN . Ridgewood , N. J. , Dec. 30 , 1943.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
