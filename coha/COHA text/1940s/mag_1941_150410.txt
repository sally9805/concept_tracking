Britain 's hallowed public ( i.e. , private ) schools last week ran into a fight that sounded for a while like the Battle of the Atlantic , but they finally limped into port , safe for the present . Up before Parliament was a proposal euphoniously titled the Public and Other Schools Bill , to let hard-pressed schools draw on the principal of their trust endowments to meet their operating deficits during the war emergency . <P> Some of the most aristocratic schools in Britain backed the bill : Eton , Harrow , Rugby , Winchester , Westminster , Shrewsbury , Charterhouse . Their existence depended on its passage . Financial troubles had already forced one public school , Weyrnouth , to close down ( TIME , April 28 . ) The rest were in dire straits , attacked on one flank by fading revenues , on the other by reformers who think the public schools are undemocratic . <P> While members interrupted the debate with cries of " Snobbery ! " the bill was brought out in the House of Commons for its third and final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Education Herwald Ramsbotham , an old school tie from Uppingham . Said he : " There is no intention of bolstering up decaying institutions . ... If this measure of self-help were refused , there would be a risk of losing ... a great national inheritance . " <P> Bitter was the opposition of Laborites , virtually all State-schooled . Argumentative Labor M.P . Aneurin Bevan* - told the House tartly : " There is a great body of opinion , which is n't sufficiently articulate , that public schools should be allowed to die a natural death . Some would like them to die a little more violently . " Crumped acid Labor M.P . Charles Ammon : " While it is said the Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton , it can be answered now that the Battle of Britain was won on the playing fields of the State schools of England . " <P> But when the smoke cleared , the bill was law . Meanwhile Ernest Bevin 's Labor Ministry issued a series of decrees making it harder than ever for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to a university . Students from 19 up are now required to join student military-training units , report their progress in university to recruiting boards , and if they fall behind in their studies they may be called up at once . Only scientific , dental and medical students get this exemption . Students of arts and humanities can get just a one-year draft deferment to enter a university and then only if they show " promise of leadership . " <P> In London , Winchester 's headmaster , Canon Spencer Leeson , deplored the competition between schools that leads to undercutting of fees . Said Canon Leeson : " The school is not a shop . It is a spiritual community . . . . The State might select schools to meet the needs and close the rest . " Answered Eton 's provost , dry Lord Quickswood : " He talks just like Adolf Hitler . " <P> <P> *No kin of Labor Minister Ernest Bevin.
