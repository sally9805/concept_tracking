txt AID BILL FILIBUSTER CHARGED AS ANGER OF SENATORS RISES Connally Points to Delaying Tactics and Murray Says Isolationists Play on ' Hate ' DANGER TO NATION IS SEEN Leaders ' Hope ' for Vote This Week , but Wheeler Talks of Reversing Public Opinion By FREDERICK It . BARKT.EY Special to Tam NEW YORK Timms . WASHINGTON , March 2 ? Senate debate on the lease-lend bill will enter its third week tomorrow with Administration leaders voicing " hope " for a final vote by the end of the week and with the opposition predicting that the measure will be under consideration for at least another fortnight . Senator Connally , a supporter of the bill , said tonight that a " gentlemen 's filibuster " was under way against the measure through the long speeches already made and still projected by opponents of the measure . He called it a " gentlemen 's filibuster " because the speeches all have been addressed to the measure and have not dealt with extraneous matters in the typical filibuster style . Two dramatic touches were given to the tense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a forceful attack made on the opposition by Senator Murray , Democrat , of Montana , who said that the Senate group led by his colleague , Senator Wheeler , was advancing an argument in which he was " unable to see any merit , " and asked " who pays for all this propaganda " on which he said the group 's case was built . The other was a statement credited Zo Senator Wheeler , who was addressing an opposition meeting in ** that he and his group believed continuance of the debate would lead to a reversal of public support of the bill such as Mr. Wheelor asserted resulted from his opposition to the Supreme Court enlargement bill four years ago . Passage of Bill Expected In the Senate and elsewhere in the capital , however , the general feeling continued strong that the bill was bound to pass in essentially its present form . This fact sharpened the criticism of the opposition , in view of the fact that debate seemed likely to dragon . It was recalled that Senator Barkley , majority leader , bad predicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be over by this time and that it might even possibly be on the President 's desk for his signature . Sharpening antagonism to the opposition 's delaying tactics rose in the Senate yesterday and was intensified by Senator Murray 's speech over the National Broadcasting System today . Mr. Murray , who came to the Senate from his generally credited " isolationist " State some years after Senator Wheeler , has usually gone along with the opposition leader . " It is not an easy matter for me to take issue with my Senatorial colleagues who are possessed of far more political experience than I am , " Mr. Murray said in his radio address . " The easy course for me would be to vote against this bill and thus escape responsibility . " Murray Recalls Irish Ancestry He said that he had studied the measure with " great care , " and recalled that he was of Irish ancestry and never had failed to voice his criticism of Britain for oppression of the Irish people . He added that it was " not easy " to cast a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an imperialistic nation , " but nevertheless felt " bound by conviction to vote for it . " " I am criticized for my conscientious conviction that this bill is designed to safeguard our country , " he said . " I have five sons registered under the Selective Service Act and God knows I would never willingly vote to send them into a war with which this country /lea no concern . I have consulted these boys and as loyal , intelligent young Americans they all approve my course . " Mr. Murray closed with the assertion that " the arguments against the bill are not based on reason but are appeals to passion and hate , " and said that if such appeals continued the nation would be " destroyed from within , no matter what bill we pass . " He said these arguments were " designed to confuse and mislead the public . " In an attempt to speed action on the bill , Senator Barkley yesterday obtained unanimous Senate consent for beginning the daily sessions at n A. M. instead of at noon . Tomorrow 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Senators Tunnell , Democrat , of Delaware , and Smothers , Democrat , of New Jersey , and an attack by SenaI tor Walsh , Democrat , of Massachusetts . Whenever the debate ends the questions of amendments will come up . Senator Barkley said yesterday that he hoped to be able to bring some of them before the Senate in intervals when Senators with set speeches were not ready to take the floor . Many amendments are pending and how long it will take to dispose of them is uncertain . It was believed tonight that Mr. Barkley would first seek a vote , as a test of Administration strength , , on an amendment of Senator Walsh to prevent the President from transferring any part of this nation 's fleet to any foreign government without Congressional approval . This amendment seems to have been chosen by the opponents of the bill as the best means of asserting their strength , thus being substituted for the Ellender amendment , which would declare that the bill does not give the President the power to use American military or naval forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
