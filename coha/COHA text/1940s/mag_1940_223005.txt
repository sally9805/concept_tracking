Chief of Staff George Catlett Marshall last August discussed a subject which Army men seldom mention in public : the difficulties of defending the Panama Canal . <P> Said he ( to a Senate subcommittee ) : " It is a terrific task to guarantee that the Canal will remain open while we still permit commercial traffic through it : Yet it is unthinkable that we would suppress commercial traffic . So we always have a hazard there . . . . " What General Marshall had in mind was the danger that some supposedly innocent tanker , tramp steamer or fishing boat on its way through the locks might suddenly turn out to be a floating time bomb . How acute , ever-present and unpredictable that peril is , the Army learned last week when its own transport , the U. S. S. Republic , docked in Panama City . <P> The Republic was bound from Hawaii to the eastern U. S. , via San Francisco and the Panama Canal . Aboard were 1,800 enlisted men , 750 officers , wives and children . One day out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Master-At-Arms Henry F. Dodd sniffed " a strange odor . " He followed his nose four decks down , found a 12 - by- 18- inch package . In it were two electrical coils , a time mechanism , two quarts of nitroglycerin . Overboard went the dismembered bomb . Henry Dodd said it was timed to go off well out in the Pacific , would have killed all hands aboard . <P> As General Marshall and the Army guard in the Canal Zone well knew , the next one might be timed to block the Canal .
