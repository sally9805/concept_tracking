On dollar-a-year men , Congress discovered last week , it is not the cost but the upkeep that counts . Each of them , on the average , said WPB , costs $3,600 a year in expenses and travel allowances . <P> Dollar-a-year men get $10 subsistence allowance for every day spent in Washington or on official trips , plus first-class travel allowances ( parlor car or lower berth ) . At that , they are a bargain . Most of them spend about $20 a day to live with their wives in crowded Washington . When they go home for weekends , they pay their own expenses and lose their $10-a-day allowance . During all trips away from the capital they also have to go on paying hotel rent-or find their room taken by others when they return .
