From his field headquarters in Denver Jim R. Button was deploying his forces last week like a general in pursuit of a highly mobile enemy . The enemy : billions of grasshoppers threatening U.S farm crops with devastation . Worst danger spots : large areas of Wyoming and Montana , with trouble building up in Arizona . <P> According to 270-lb . Jim Button , Assistant Chief of the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's division of grasshopper control , this is the worst grasshopper season since 1940 . But the hoppers are having a tough time ; they are being mowed down in their youth by new poisons , new spreading devices and far better organization among their human enemies . <P> Bran Bait . Stay-at-home grasshoppers are common all over the U.S. , but the migrating types from the range lands do the most damage . After they reach maturity they rise in roaring clouds , fly hundreds of miles and utterly destroy any crop they settle on . <P> The best way to deal with them is to kill them before they get their wings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airplane over as many square miles as possible in the outbreak areas . Every day 53 pilots were flying 35 airplanes in relays , as long as daylight lasted . <P> It took 20 Ibs. per acre of old-style bait ( bran and sawdust poisoned with arsenic ) to control the hoppers . The newest bait ( bran poisoned with chlordane or toxaphene ) is so much more effective that five Ibs. per acre is enough unless the hoppers are almost full-grown . The biggest plane in use , a DC-3 , spreads 20,000 acres every day . Since there are from 35 to 100 hoppers per square yard in the outbreak areas , a single DC-3 can kill several billions daily . <P> Egg Count . Dutton 's experts start each summers campaign the previous autumn estimating the number of eggs that have been laid just under the ground in the chief breeding areas . Then the division publishes a brightly colored grasshopper map showing ranchers and farmers where to expect trouble . <P> Next step is to watch the weather and its effect on the young hoppers . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions ; a cold rain or a late frost can wipe them out . So can their natural enemies ( other insects , birds , etc. ) - which the Government 's experts keep track of , too . <P> The grasshopper war is expensive . Dutton 's division expects to spend some $4-500,000 of emergency funds this year-and next year may be worse , for grasshopper populations have a way of building up over a series of years . But the effort pays off : the Agriculture Department claims that every dollar it spends on scotching grasshoppers saves $55 worth of crops .
