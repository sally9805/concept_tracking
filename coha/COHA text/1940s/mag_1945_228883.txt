The shape of things to come in the peacetime U.S. was still forming hazily , like ectoplasm at a spiritualists ' meeting . But U.S. citizens , staring with a sance-sitter 's skeptical fascination , began to nudge each other last week . Government and industry really seemed to be conjuring a facsimile of normal living . <P> After 43 months of drawing up blue laws for industry , the War Production Board threw all but two score of its war time restrictions to the winds , giddily told startled U.S. manufacturers to make all the automobiles they wished ( see BUSINESS ) . The same went for washing machines , ironers , pots &; pans , electric razors , pottery , Kleenex , toys , radios , suits , dresses , storage batteries and photo graphic film . <P> Few of these items would be available in any quantity before Christmas , but the words rolled on the tongue like bubble sum . Some U.S. citizens even enjoyed knowing that there were no more restrictions on cotton linters , natural resins , green bone glue , horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus lines , which had been forced to use the skip-stop system , a wartime innovation apparently designed to facilitate passing up passengers , would this week be allowed to halt under virtually every street light if the driver was in the mood . <P> The Federal Housing Administration resumed its prewar program of insuring mortgage loans on housing . The new houses would come later . <P> Radio " hams " who were ordered to dismantle their sets and get off the air on Dec. 7 , 1941 began putting their sets together again . They were once more free to stay up all night hoarsely calling " CQ CQ CQ " into a microphone , without being suspected of espionage . <P> President Harry Truman prepared to give Montgomery Ward &; Co. back to Sewell Avery and his stockholders , other seized plants back to private management . And with an eye on the clock , he vowed to ask Congress to repeal War Time .
