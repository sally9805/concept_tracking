The osprey struck it , was held against its upper side briefly , was pushed out by an eddy , seemed to be drifting away , but was stopped again when the longest branch slid beneath his half-opened wing . Now the clean brown and white bird was wreckage among the muddy leaves , grass , and twigs snagged by the willow . When one of the current 's cradles reached him , the soaked feathers of his head floated out , but at once were submerged again . The trout wrestled in the loose claws . Torn but alive , it finally worked itself free . The osprey did not seem to know . As soon as his talons were empty , they folded in , limp . The ripples began to slap one inert foot against the branch . The harrier discovered the osprey . Swinging along the riverbank in his hunting , he glimpsed the white head in the water 's sweep . His sharp , high scream was like talons piercing . The cries that followed might have been the attacks of a ravenous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's taunts  --  a shrill threat breaking into impatient gibes . The osprey had heard it many times . The closed eyes did not open , and the claws of the osprey did not twitch . But the wild ones are not deceived about death . The harrier must have sensed that under the numb brain of the fish hawk some valor of flesh was fighting . Though he could not enter the water , he continued to strike his enemy with his voice . That voice had roused the energy of the young osprey each time that it stirred his parents to a chase . Twice that very day , the sound had stimulated a surge of anger in him , and therefore a surge of strength . The harrier might more nearly have defeated his rival if he had flown away , silent , leaving in the osprey 's ears and the depths of his spirit only the vast indifference of the water 's roar . But he remained , screaming , above the willow . And then , once , when the osprey 's claw struck the bough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found it again . The next effort the osprey made was to reach for the same support with his other claw . Slowly , pulling one above the other , the feet lifted the great wet bird until he was up in the willow 's tangle of boughs . He rested there with his wings spread and his feathers fluffed to dry . A weak shake , another more vigorous , rid the feathers of some of the water 's weight . Between these efforts the osprey was quiet , gathering and pointing his energy , a skill practiced many times before dives . The harrier still tormented him , but not so constantly . That hawk was watching a prowling mink , who was finding helpless prey in the empty canals of the marsh . The mink was so excited by this windfall that he almost ignored the chance of becoming a victim himself . And the harrier , at the rare possibility of catching a mink , was so excited in turn that he too forgot caution . The instant came when the osprey 's wings could lift him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hovered over the willow , not quite secure . He crossed to the island . His next exercise was a flight up the island shore . The mink had reached the end of a channel , just inside the riverbank . The harrier watched him , but was hiding , gliding out over the water , lower than the tops of the brush . At any time the mink might pounce , exposing himself on the open mud , and then the harrier 's talons would strike into his fur . The harrier faced downstream . From the island 's tip came the osprey , riding the breeze , sweeping towards him without a wingbeat . When he was close , he cried a warning and the harrier swerved , but not quickly enough . The osprey had dived upon him , and his claw struck the harrier 's head . The harrier heeled over , stunned , and hit the water . Instantly it snared his wings . With no chance to right himself , he was carried down on his back into the tumbling current where Cottonwood Creek joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the . /1. bank , then alighted on a snag for a further rest . As he waited , his ears were touched by a sound that was new . It came from upstream and was like a distant , reaching cry . As it drew nearer it fluctuated into numerous voices , clear and urgent , the voices of Canada geese , midway on a long journey . All had the same searching , uncertain tone . Could these voices , anywhere , ever mean , This is home ? Soon the osprey 's eyes found the geese , flying in a long , thin line with a forward point near the center . The line swerved at the river 's bend , its inner side consolidating , the outer side swinging more widely . Coming on again , both sides straightened , rippling from the point to the ends . The line seemed one . as the voices had , but when it approached , the waver of wings made it many . As the geese beat their way towards him , the osprey could see the black feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the level bills strained towards some remote goal . The geese were above him . Then they were a little beyond . Seen from behind , the flock pointed more sharply , like the outline of a single bird , pushing south . The voices were lighter now , trailing their call . The osprey raised his wings and glided out off the branch . He circled once and , finding his steady , smooth rhythm , started down the river behind the geese . At the end of the valley the flock turned eastward around a butte and disappeared . The osprey flew on without them . He needed no other guide but the shine of water below , and he had that . The river led through a pass , out of Jackson Hole . Beyond , he found the wider world . It seemed full of movement beneath him , for the mountain ranges were so close against one another that they were like waves , crested ridges , and valley troughs , as far as he could see . A tint of gold touched a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the clean shade that promises brighter color . The rays pierced up through a westward canyon . They reached more of the clouds . Soon there was flame in the nonliving universe , fire on the polished rock of the peaks . and the vapor . The fire and vapor were all in motion . The osprey flew into sunlight . Author of articles on John L. Lewis , Harold Ross of ' the New Yorker , and being drafted , Dale Kramer is now Sergeant Kramer of Yank Far East . MR . TUASON DALE KRAMER 1M-73 W HEN I first saw Mr. Tuason he was sitting at a massive , polished table ( obviously a relic of some Philip- pine government office which had been destroyed by the Japanese ) in the long , asbestos-roofed , leaf-walled , dirt-floored shed which serves as the office of Mapaso Imprento ( Hot Press ) , a newspaper published by American soldiers . He was writing , but his stocky figure , clad in a blue linen blouse , GI trousers , and gum boots , was erect in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one side . He held his writing arm thrust well forward , yet there was a graceful serenity in the way he dipped his common pen into a wide-mouthed inkwell and returned it to his round , careful letters . Mr. Tuason , I learned , had been sent to Hot Press by the civilian employment bureau which had been hastily organized to relieve the destitute Filipino population . But when his written English turned out to be stiff and formal he had been set to addressing envelopes , copying lists , bundling newspapers , and even to turning the crank of the mimeograph machine . No one seemed to know much about Mr. Tuason 's background , except that he was a refugee from a nearby province , not yet completely liberated , where he was believed to have been a senator  --  or ( since the law called for a single incumbent ) the senate itself . From his placid copying , 1 took him to be a village politician well-satisfied at finding himself in possession of a meaty Yankee plum . Late one afternoon , a barefoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , carrying a bamboo bag of simple carpenter 's tools . Since cupboards were a critical need , the officerin-charge , a young lieutenant , fell on him eagerly . An unhurried man , the carpenter listened for some moments before indicating that he spoke no English . Mr. Tuason , called on to interpret , fired half a dozen volleys of dialect and announced simply , " Understands . " The trouble was that the carpenter 's wizened face had not indicated that he had heard anything . The lieutenant reopened the subject and Mr. Tuason obligingly turned and spoke again to the carpenter , whose face continued to register nothing . " Understands , " Mr. Tuason said firmly , returning to his penmanship . The lieutenant had to let it go at that . Next morning the carpenter  --  whose name turned out to be Agapito  --  returned with a couple of armloads of boards , and the lieutenant , feeling more hopeful , had Mr. Tuason translate detailed instructions . When Agapito set to work , Mr. Tuason , instead of going back to his copying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gum boots , and watched the sawing and hammering . Occasionally he tossed a string of dialect at Agapito and once in a while got up to lend a hand with the measuring . A pile of notched and jointed boards grew , and with it the lieutenant 's apprehension . After a while he tried to call Agapito , through Mr. Tuason , to an accounting . Mr. Tuason squatted on his heels and pulled the boards about , pointing to this notch and that . The lieutenant 's puzzlement deepened . Finally Mr. Tuason got to his feet . " I am artisan , " he said indulgently , but firmly , It happened that my chair was near Mr. Tuason 's , and when he came back I inquired if he had formerly been a carpenter . He smiled graciously . " Some . " Then he made quick pointing motions with his hands . " I direct . " He sat all day , directing , and the cupboards fell together magically . A few days later the Philippines atlas was lost . Mr. Tuason quietly took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dispatches and correcting occasional misspellings . VV E WERE after all the material we could get on the Japanese occupation and Philippine life , and consequently I took to pumping Mr. Tuason whenever the chance arose . Between quick gestures and a wide , if rusty , vocabulary he expressed himself generally lucidly and always intelligently . But information about Mr. Tuason himself came slowly and in little pieces . One of them , for example , slipped out while he and I were on our way to see the superintendent of schools , from whom we hoped to gather details of Japanese domination of education . The streets were filled with barefoot Filipinos , walking in mud whipped into ankle-deep pudding by American army vehicles . Mr. Tuason halted suddenly . " Look . " A sweep of his arm took in the people . " All afoot . Before Japs , many Filipinos had cars . " His eyes narrowed to humorous slits and he shrugged . " I see big men of this town hiking . " Filipinos , he explained , do not like to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was formerly reckoned to a considerable extent by his mode of travel , a state of affairs which he had heard existed in American civilization as well . Mr. Tuason made long , diverse sweeps with his arms . " Poorstreet , weaving through the crowd , we were occasionally thrust off the road into one of the small , open-front shops , whose walls had begun to sag and whose signs  --  most of them in English  --  had peeled badly . Some trade was in progress , but most of the shops were unoccupied and the others were the more pitiful for the few items displayed . In one an old lady stood by a single jar of diminutive , unattractive doughnuts . In another a man in a neat white linen coat minded a glass counter containing a few boxes of Japanese saddle soap and a small pile of wide shoestrings . I stopped before a chipped blue and white sign which declared that the Majestic Beauty Shop curled hair electrically during the daytime . Mr. Tuason laughed . " No more . " Then his face sobered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an edifice . " Our Filipino economy ... like that . Even the beauty . " Mr. Tuason took me to the home rather than the office of the superintendent of schools  --  Mr. Villanuava  --  since , as it turned out , the two had been friends since youth . Following destruction of their house by bombs , the superintendent and his family had taken refuge in a corner of a Catholic academy whose thick , cracked mortar walls had been painted a reddish cream . Mr. Villanuava was not at home at the moment , but his wife welcomed us into a long , low-ceilinged chamber in which narrow beds with canopies of white mosquito netting and other pieces of furniture had been distributed over the damp cement floor in an unsuccessful effort to create an illusion of separate rooms . Mrs. Villanuava , a slender , middle-aged woman with soft skin and vivid dark eyes , ushered us to rattan rocking chairs . She and Mr. Tuason spoke for a few moments in a rush of Spanish , occasionally trans-lating passages to me . Mrs. Villanuava , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke familiarly of the family " foxhole , " as a peacetime woman might speak of her garden , and the foxhole was responsible for laying her low . One night a bomb fragment had slashed into the shelter and killed her niece , a " professor of the piano , " twenty-six years old , a concert player and a teacher . That shock , along with destruction of their home and the strain of nights in the foxhole , had been too much for Mrs. Villanuava 's nervous system . Filipinos rarely tell completely grave stories of the Japanese occupation for fear of being thought self-pitying . A personal reverse , particularly , is related humorously or even hilariously . Consequently , with a quick motion of her hands , Mrs Villanuava ripped away the gloom . " We will talk of good times coming , " she said in English . But these two had seen each other only once or twice during the occupation , so that references to that period flitted in and out of the conversation . Whenever one of the bits flew past , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference by Mr. Tuason to a bowing school for Filipinos conducted by the Japanese caused Mrs. Villanuava 's eyes to dance and she clasped her hands together and rocked gleefully . The Japs are the greatest exponents of the plain and fancy bow on earth , and the Filipinos had been required to learn the code . They had to incline their heads deferentially upon passing a Jap , and if any conversation were involved , had to bow three times from the waist . There were separate salaams for Japs of high rank . Bowing schools were held in each of the districts into which the Japs had divided the city . A form of charades was played , with someone representing a Jap of a given rank while the others practiced the proper bob or bend . In the matter of the bowing academy , Mrs. Villanuava registered her only personal complaint . " I am mother of many children , and yet I was forced to go , " she said . The Filipinos are very respectful of age , particularly of the mother , and she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pointed out logically , what more could be expected of men who do not allow their own wives to sit at table with them ? ' W E HAD just about given up hope of seeing Mr. Villanuava , who was on an inspection tour of liberated territory , when he came in , wiping rain from his horn-rimmed spectacles . He was short and cherubic , and , like many Filipinos , he spoke English with ringing gusto . After introductions , he sat down , placed his hands on the knees of his short legs , and declared , " You will hear the first account of my investigation . " Investigation is a favorite word with the Filipinos , probably because one of their chief complaints against the Japs was that fact-finding before punishment was not a Japanese weakness . Slot boxes were posted at street corners and Filipinos were encouraged to inform on their neighbors . The result was considerable blackmail . Schools were reopening in good shape , Mr. Villanuava said , with many of the walls and floors which the Japs had torn up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Japs had been more interested in using the schools for housing and fuel than for indoctrinating children . Where teachers cared to continue classes  --  usually in homes  --  they provided a small salary and not much interference . Officials glanced through the books  --  all of which were printed in English  --  and checked passages dealing with democracy , George Washington , Franklin D. Roosevelt , and the like , and these were ordered pasted over . When the Filipinos carried out the instructions , they used transparent brown paper . The Japanese did not object . As near as Mr. Villanuava can figure it , discipline in Japan is such that no one thinks of disobeying an order , and the Japs were incapable of realizing that children would study the portions under the brown paper even if they neglected the other parts . After a while the children got books designed to teach them the Japanese language . Instruction started off with a word which sounded like " Ohio " and meant " Good morning . " One child would shout " Ohio " to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange which was always good for a laugh . II O NE DAY Mr. Tuason announced that it was time now for him to return to his home . His province had been liberated , and he asked me if I would like to go there with him and visit his house for a few days . Because we would have to catch a boat at daybreak , Mr. Tuason suggested that I spend the night in his temporary home in the city . I was late in leaving the office , and while I was on my way across town an alert smothered the lights , leaving me floundering in the deep ruts . By good luck , a scrubby , thin-bearded Filipino to whom I applied for directions turned out to be a guerrilla from Mr. Tucson 's home town , who knew where he was living and led me straight to his house . Mr. Tuason had been on the lookout for me and , inviting the guerrilla in for coffee , he led us upstairs . Though his immediate family had already departed for the province , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little the coffee was brought to us out of the shadows . The alert was a long one , and , since Mr. Tuason felt that the corroborative presence of the guerrilla permitted him to speak more personally , I got a pretty good picture of the impact that the Japanese occupation had had on Mr. Tuason and his town . MHE AMERICAN and Filipino armies had A. already surrendered when the Japs came to the village . At first about fifty soldiers moved in . The scene was the age-old one of conquerors and conquered ; sound of boots in the streets , townspeople peering anxiously from windows . Then search of the houses , the Japs tramping in , hats on , taking for themselves gold , diamonds , and such other items as struck their fancy . After a few days most of the soldiers departed , leaving a score or so to settle in the modern school building . For the Japs , it was an ideal life . Each day a patrol made a leisurely trip into the countryside , and when they returned theycarried chickens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever looked appetizing . Nevertheless , the Japs did not live as well as might have been expected , for the reason , Mr. Tuason and the guerrilla agreed , that they are natural pigs . They would cut up an octopus , cook it with a conglomeration of vegetables and sugar , and live on the swill for several days , washing it down with hot , heavily-sugared tea . Jap soldiers do not drink anything cool if they can help it . Usually they sat around in shorts ; they seldom bathed and , having generally a single uniform apiece , laundered rarely . The course of events in Mr. Tuason 's town was typical of the Japanese occupation everywhere . First , Mr. Tuason 's trucks and buses and cargo boats were seized , which would have halted commerce even if factories in the cities had not closed . The large store ( operated by Mr. Tuason ) , most of the smaller ones , and the market  --  an important factor in peacetime living  --  soon went out of business . Rice and comotes ( the Filipino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exchange with farmers , partly because the Japs requisitioned a portion of what crop there was . People existed largely by going into the swamps and digging roots of the big-leafed palawan , which they fried . Since there was no longer a market for copra , only a few coconuts were harvested . The milk of these few was boiled and the resulting oil used as fuel in the rude lamps which replaced candles and electricity . The profound mental depression of the Filipinos , an extremely proud and sensitive people , was also a factor in the breakdown of living standards . It is true that the Japs confiscated all nails , as well as every other scrap of metal , including plumbing from those houses which had it ; yet the people might have cut the sword-bladed leaves of the nipa and by stringing them on strips of bamboo have made new roofs or walls for their houses , or they could have woven rattan or bamboo furniture to replace that broken or worn out . Their hearts were too heavy . Homes grew dilapidated and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their gardens . They awaited the return of the Americans with a faith that was downright touching . The American soldier lives close to humdrum essentials , used to snapping to heel with a deferential " Yes , sir , " and moving , except when against the enemy , under rigid restrictions . Arriving among a people sorely tried by oppression , he is a little startled to find himself hailed as a glamorous , fabulously rich knight chasing evil-doers through the world . The Filipinos , moreover , have an attractive way of personalizing such phrases as , " When you came . " It 's a change , anyhow . The radio in Mr. Tuason 's house in town was confiscated , but the Japs were never able to locate a second on his farm . He heard the news from the States , as did others , and passed it on . Sometimes , too , there appeared mysteriously among the people American bars of chocolate , packs of cigarettes , magazines , and even apples , brought by submarine or plane . The presence of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans were in touch with the situation . Young men began to drift into the hills . Mr. Tuason at first held the title of technical adviser and later major in the local guerrillas , but that was only a fairly high rank , since titles were flung around on a pretty lavish scale . He was too old , though , for much active duty , and most of the time he stayed indoors , reading his books and making secret notes of the occupation , which he planned to use as background for a series of articles for the local paper after the Americans got back and it was re-established . HE Japs usually avoided rough han- dling of the more influential Filipinos ( I had learned by this time that Mr. Tuason had been a representative in the legislature at Manila , rather than merely a local official ) , and sometimes the Jap commander dropped in to spread the co-prosperity gospel . However , bored with his bucolic life , and economic conditions being what they were , he usually guided the discussion into more philosophical channels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being brown-skinned Orientals , did not take to the Japanese , Mr. Tuason avoided certain delicate local subjects , but pointed out that Filipinos , having derived much of their culture from the Spanish and Americans , think of themselves as Westerners . Moreover , they feared an attempt to convert them from Catholicism . Another time the Jap officer , in a particularly thoughtful mood , gave his explanation of the attack on a nation so potentially powerful as the United States , Overcrowded Japan needed room , he said . If she won she would get all she wanted . If she were defeated , the end would have been partly gained by reduction of the population . Despite these discussions , the situation for Mr. Tuason was always ticklish , particularly since a rather large percentage of the town 's population . were his relatives and the Jap policy was to visit punishment upon whatever relatives happened to he available . When invited to take a post in the puppet government , he declined with dignity but also with diplomacy . An even more delicate situation arose when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a charge of furnishing information to the guerrillas . They were taken late in the afternoon and carried , screaming , across the green plaza before the helpless eyes of the population . When they were about half way across , Mr. Tuason put his hand on the top of his hat and sprinted after them . He managed to pop inside the schoolhouse , where he was discouraged to find that the Japs had already laid out three hoods , an axe , and three blocks . He received permission , however , to make a plea . Pointing out that the girls could not have given information for the good reason that there was nothing to reveal , other than that a handful of soldiers were living in the schoolhouse , he raised the Filipino cry for " investigation . " Finally he was isolated in another room and the girls were questioned separately for several hours . They were released , but Mr. Tuason was aware that only his standing in the province had turned the scale , and the Japs were not pleased that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew over the town for the first time , the Japs explained that they were their own on maneuvers . But some of the ships came so low that the white stars under their wings could be seen . After American troops landed , Jap combat farces began to move through the town , and the local garrison showed anxiety about citizens who might transmit information . Mr. Tuason gathered his wife and ( since he had no children of his own ) a number of nieces and nephews , some of them babies , and escaped one night in a boat to the American positions . It was to Support all this family while he was away from home that he had taken the job with Hot Press . HI A r DAWN Mr. Tuason and I picked our way through the mud to the wharves , followed by a sturdy nephew with Mr. Tuason 's basket and my waterproof sack . Mr. Tuason was dressed trimly in suntan shirt and trousers , a dark green sun helmet , and his gum boots . Just before climbing into the boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy . By the time the sun was up , Mr. Tuason was in a gay mood . Two more guerrillas from his town were on the boat and they told us that the local Jap garrison , including the officer who had advocated a cull of the population , had been caught by the guerrillas and slain . Somewhat more startling was the information that most of the townspeople believed Mr. Tuason to be dead . As we approached Mr. Tuason 's town , he pointed to a stone and earth pier extending into the sea . " My work , " he said , showing a slight pride . " I induced pesos while at Manila . " I asked him if he 'd had a tough election fight after that . He laughed . " I point to the pier , the new school , the good roads  --  no one cares to oppose . " After a moment he added slyly , " Very American , no ? " We hurried up the road , past a huge stone church built strongly enough by the ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against attacks from roving bands of Mohammedan Maros from the island of Mindanao . The town , mostly of shaggy , brown nipa-leaf houses , wasbadly disarranged owing to lack of repairs and a recent typhoon which had ripped off many roofs . We turned into the main street , past a crowd waiting for rations of American bread . The people stared incredulously at Mr. Tuason , while merchants , whose shelves held incongruous tins of Spam and cheese , rushed from their shops to greet him . He threw an arm around each , but hurried on after a word or two in dialect . Mr. Tuason 's house , like many Filipino wooden residences , was square and wide-eyed , with the wide heavy boards of the walls  --  some of them placed vertically  --  giving a paneled effect which might have been austere without the small kaleidoscopic panes of the broad , outward-sliding windows of the upper story . The bottom wails , indented a foot or two , housed only foot-thick pillars . We climbed the outside staircase and entered through the open door . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were skating about on slabs of coconut husk , burnishing the floor . A smaller boy in a flimsy waist-length shirt and no pants stood watching . The room was large , with dark paneling decorated with oil paintings of Filipino landscapes . Seeing Mr. Tuason , the older children kicked aside their coconut husks and rushed to him , followed at a somewhat slower pace by the smaller boy . They kissed first his hand , then his face . An attractive girl of twenty , dressed in a floor-length white gown and heelless straw slippers , glided swiftly into the room and thrust her way among the children . That was the beginning , and a sample , of Mr. Tuason 's homecoming . After a little time he was able to establish me in a tall wooden rocker and to sit the girl down at the piano , to entertain . The family filed in from the rear of the house , the townspeople up the stairs . I had met Mrs. Tuason previously . She came into the room and stood for a moment watching her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indulgent and a little amused . When she came to shake hands with me , Mr. Tuason spied her and ran up and took both her hands , speaking happily in Spanish . She nodded , more amused than ever , and gave him a moth-
