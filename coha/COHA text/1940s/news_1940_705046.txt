txt Governor Lehman 's Speech The Times 's Editorial Evokes Expressions of Disfavor and Approval To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I think you dodged in your editorial " Hitler as the Issue . " You quoted Governor Lehman as saying that " nothing that could happen in the United States could give Hitler , Mussolini , Stalin and the Government of Japan more satisfaction than the defeat of * * * Franklin D. Roosevelt . " You then proceed to say two things about Governor Lehman 's statement . First , that it is equivalent to saying that a vote for Willkie is a vote for Hitler . That is a rather careless interpretation . You can not seriously maintain that believing Hitler would rejoice at seeing Roosevelt defeated is the same as believing that any one who votes for Willkie is by that act endorsing Hitler . A vote for Willkie is not a vote for Hitler regardless of what satisfaction Hitler would get out of Willkie 's election , and of course all that Governor Lehman said was that the dictators would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , you say that this remark of Governor Lehman is unjust . You nowhere in your editorial assert that Governor Lehman 's remark is not true . Governor Lehman did not say that Mr. Willkie has not been as straightforward as President Roosevelt in condemning Hitler and everything for which he stands . It is perfectly easy to grant that and still to recognize the fact that Hitler would greatly rejoice at Willkie 's triumph over Roosevelt . Furthermore , entirely aside from any stories that have come from Berlin or Rome , or any reports on Hitlerites in America , it should be clear to any . thoughtful person that Hitler must inevitably wish for Roosevelt 's defeat simply because Roosevelt is anti-Hitler in action while Willkie is necessarily under the circumstances anti-Hitler in words . This is not an attack on Willkie 's patriotism ; it is not a statement that a vote for Willkie is a vote for Hitler . It is simply recognition of the facts as they exist . I think you should present a case against the truth of what Governor Lehman said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argue that the Governor 's statement is equivalent to saying something which the Governor did not say or to maintain that it is unjust to recognize realistically the facts of the situation in which we find ourselves in this campaign . J. M. O'NEILL . Brooklyn , Oct. 1 , 1940 . Utterance Condemned To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I am writing to thank you for your editorial this morning in which you rebuke Governor Lehman for the statement he made yesterday that nothing could give more satisfaction . to Hitler , Mussolini , Stalin and the Government of Japan than for the American people to defeat Mr. Roosevelt in the coming election . I rejoice in a newspaper which so fearlessly and ably condemns those in high offices for such offensive utterances as that made by Governor Lehman . TENNIS LOIS GRIFFIN . ' New York , Oct. 1 , 1940 . Another Quotation To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In commenting on Governor Lehman 's speech at the Democratic State Convention in your editorial " Hitler as the Issue , " you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You might have quoted the following from his speech : " The overwhelming majority of the American people have been determined and are now resolute that democracy as we know it in this land must survive . " Was Mr. Roosevelt trying to see that it did survive in his effort to pack the court of last resort ? Was he trying to see that it did survive when he attempted to " purge " from the United States Senate all those elected representatives of the people who had opposed this packing ? As a matter of fact , the Governor was so much concerned at the determination on'the part of the President to pack the court that he wrote a letter in opposition . H. V. SETH . Springfield , Pa. , Oct. 1 , 1940 . Smoking , a Solvent of Hate To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Autumn came on us suddenly . Football time and smoking time for America . Soon at our stadia , above the great crowds , there will be a heavy mist of smoke from thousands of cigars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as matches are lighted . The air will be warm with fellowship and good-will . It will be as though a pipe of peace were being passed from one to the other . People who smoke together ca n't hate one another . The very act of smoking in a group is like a magic solvent that cleanses one of enmity . Ah , if the dimensions of this picture could be multiplied to include the rest of the world : crowds , polyglot crowds with clouds of smoke above them , but not a bomber in sight ! In such smoke there is peace , contentment . Let America light up and show the way . HAROLD EDESON . New York , Sept. 26 , 1940 . Books for Seamen Needed To THE EDITOR OF THE NEw YORK TIMES : An unusual need for books and magazines for seamen on foreign ships has been recently brought to the attention of the Conrad Library , Seamen 's Church Institute of New York . We have been giving books in quantities to officers and seamen from British , Belgian and Dutch vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French and Dutch is running very low . These men , often on long voyages , depend largely upon interesting books for their only recreation in these hazardous days . In many cases their contacts with home and the normal supply of libraries by their own countries has been entirely cut off by the war . They all read widely ; requests come to us for books of current significance , recent biography and popular fiction . Seamen messengers will call for donations of books within the ? metropolitan area . Packages may be marked for particular nationality groups .

To Alleviate Moving Woes Staggered Expiration Dates on Leases of Apartments Urged To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : . The mad rush is over . The annual mass movement of tenants will now be adjourned for about a year . The moving van concerns have fattened their coffers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was one of the great many who went through the purgatory of moving during the past few days . I am sure my experience was typical . The moving man entered into a contract with me to remove my furniture at a certain hourly rate . I was informed that I was to be the second family to be moved that day . He said it would take about three hours and that ? his men would be at my apartment at 10 o'clock in the morning . They arrived at 11:15 , although they claimed that the van was at the door at 10:55 and that I was to be charged from that time . The removal of the furniture was fairly rapid  --  about two hours . The new apartment was about one mile away , yet it took the van three-quarters of an hour to reach it . The three men evidently stopped for lunch at my expense . Their work at the new apartment was phlegmatic and desultory . In all , it took five hours and fifteen minutes to . complete the job . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to tip three men , and of course we had to sign a receipt that all the articles had been received in good condition , although we had no time to make an inspection . As a matter of fact , the radio was " disturbed . " the kitchen table broken , and half an ear of a statue of a lion was clipped . We have , however , no recourse . It is now time for the tenants to organize and insist upon the landlords staggering the leases that we are compelled to sign . If they do not , then the tenants must go to the Legislature for relief . The common law doctrine that when a tenant holds over after the termination of his lease his tenancy continues for another year must be ended . In its place there should be a statute declaring either that the tenancy is extended for a period of only three months or that the tenant becomes a tenant from month to month . Louts A. STONE . New York , Oct. 2 , 1940 . Salvageable Housing Practical To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , salvageable houses are produced by only a few private concerns . Most of them are in an experimental stage . Wooden , nonsalvageable houses are constructed everywhere by traditional , . hand-made methods and the process is bolstered by a remarkably elaborate and efficient distribution system . The required raw and finished parts are obtainable everywhere . If a simple method for quick production of salvageable houses and barracks could be introduced for nation-wide use , coupled to the building industry 's established distribution system , the flow of useful salvageable structures would be rapid . Toward the close of the last war I. designed , manufactured , transported and erected a dozen samples of Standard House No. 1 of the United States Housing Corporation . They were salvageable wooden cottages of six-room capacity . designed for year-round occupancy . After the war they were advertised In THE TIMES for public auction . Private individuals paid nearly 80 per cent of their original cost of $1,960 , easily a , world 's record for war salvage . The method used was simple and devised for use in thousands of woodworking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevented the United States Housing Corporation , headed by the late Otto Eidlitz , from performing a valuable demonstration on a wholesale scale . ROBERT TAPPAN . Forest Hills , N. Y. , Sept. 22 , 1940 . A Question of Consistency To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : No matter how strong their desire may be , at the moment , to re-elect Mr. Roosevelt , it is difficult for me to see how any man or woman who favors a law limiting a President to eight or six years in office can consistently or conscientiously at this election vote the Democratic ticket . To say the least , he or she would not be living up to the courage of their convictions . JOHN HARSEN RHOADEE . New York , Sept. 28 , 1940.
