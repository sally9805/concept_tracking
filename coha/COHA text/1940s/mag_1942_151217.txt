" The Ethiopians have shown that they are fit to be free . " <P> Thus last week Foreign Under Secretary Richard Kidston Law* explained to BBC listeners why the British Government had finally got round to restoring the independence of Ethiopia . <P> But the two-year pact which King of Kings Haile Selassie signed with the Brit ish Government bore little resemblance to Magna Charta . In return for $10,000,000 in cash , the Lion of Judah handed . the British a blank check . According to the agreement , British judges and assessors will sit on the benches of Ethiopian courts , the Ethiopian police force will be officered by Britons . <P> The Emperor furthermore agreed to give all possible aid to the British Army , to stage no private wars , to permit only the British and those to whom they give permission to fly over his country . The management of the Djibouti-Addis Ababa railway and the wireless station at Addis Ababa will be in the hands of the Commander in Chief of the British Army in Africa . The Army also received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assessed at $3 20,000,000-$360,000,000 ) without payment . To help guide the Negus ' footsteps , British political advisers as well as a military mission will be appointed . <P> Parliament greeted the pact with solemn rejoicing . In the House of Lords Viscount Cecil of Chelwood called it an " extremely vivid contrast to the German Government 's ' New Order . ' " Only a few of the Lords had reservations about Ethiopia 's new freedom . Though Anthony Eden had assured the House of Commons that Haile Selassie had promised to abolish slavery just as soon as possible , some of their Lordships wanted to know why the pact was signed before the emancipation was a fact . <P> The newly created Lord Wedgwood , potteries scion and for 35 years a stanchly liberal M.P. , went off on another tack . " This overemphasized question of slavery ! One can go into a sheik 's tent in the British-controlled Jordan valley and have one 's coffee served by a black slave . Do n't let us be too virtuous about these things . " What worried Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Ethiopia outright . <P> One voice questioned whether Ethiopia had really been freed . Said Lord Davies carefully : " The agreement . . . strikes some as a hard bargain . ... So long as Abyssinia is bound down by some of the clauses , it can not be described as free and independent . " <P> But if Haile Selassie , busy receiving the congratulations of his people , had any such doubts , he kept them to himself . From Addis Ababa , where he has been waiting the British Government 's pleasure since last May , he cabled his thanks to Winston Churchill for helping to restore his country 's independence . <P> <P> *Youngest son of onetime ( 1922-23 ) Prime Minister Andrew Bonar Law .
