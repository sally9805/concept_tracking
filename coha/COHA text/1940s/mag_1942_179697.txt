" The Italians go to The Barber of Seville five nights a week to enjoy themselves , not to be cultured . Why should n't we ? " To answer his own question , George Houston is busily directing a group of unfamed singers , called the American Music Theater , in a small building in a Los Angeles park . <P> George Houston is a onetime teacher in Rochester 's Eastman School of Music who is currently starred as a horse-opera hero in Path 's serial The Lone Rider . ( " Those horses bounce the bejesus out of me-I hate ' em . " ) But Houston has learned things in Hollywood . He takes grand operas in hand , revamps the stories , alters characters , rewords arias-and of course translates them into English . Rossini 's The Barber of Seville , now in rehearsal , he telescoped from a three-and-a-half to a two-and-a-half-hour opera ( including intermissions ) , put in spoken dialogue , built up the lesson scene between Rosina and the Count by adding comedy lines , changed Dr. Bartolo from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with red putty nose ) into a near likeness of Cinemactor Frank Morgan . Dr. Bartolo 's first aria he changed from a scolding song into a Gilbert- &-Sullivanian; self-analysis : <P> I 'm a man of great affection , <P> Though I 'm given to bisection . <P> I am very near perfection- <P> That 's the way I see myself . <P> Taking another cue from Hollywood , Houston trains his singing actors to master the delayed timing of gags ( known to the profession as " takes and double takes " ) . Bob Hope is his model . Says Houston : " Our shows come out as plays with music . " And tired businessmen have hailed them as " opera for husbands . "
