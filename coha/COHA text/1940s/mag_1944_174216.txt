All over the world last Sunday , Anglican and Episcopal priests read the collect for the Sunday next before Advent : " Stir up , we beseech thee , O Lord , the wills of thy faithful people . . . . " But few &; far between were the clergy who followed the old English custom of Stir Up Sunday , taking their sermon texts from the collect 's opening sentence . Fewer still were the irreverent moppets who piped the day 's old ditty : <P> Stir up , we beseech thee , <P> The pudding in the pot , <P> And when we get home , <P> We 'll eat it all hot .
