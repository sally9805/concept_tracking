txt An effort to pledge the Labor Department 's fifteenth annual conference on labor legislation to President Truman 's civil rights program was defeated today by a vote of 23 to 21 after an acrimonious debate . In general American Federation of Labor delegates opposed the resolution and officials of the Congress of Industrial Organizations favored it . Southerners were also divided on the issue . Nearly all of the 143 delegates attended the final conference , which was addressed by a former Secretary of Labor , Miss Frances Perkins , but only - forty- four were recorded when the resolution was put to vote . The civil rights issue was thrown ' into the conference by Harry Kranz , legislative director of the CIO Industrial Council of New Jersey , as a minority report after the resolutions committee , by a tie vote , had decided not to put the proposal before the meeting . Mr. Kranz defended the Truman program as " not sectional . " He urged its support because of the President 's election victory , which , he said , had proved that the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Labor Commissioner of Georgia , fought to sidetrack the resolution . " We will not stand for you telling us how to handle our state laws , " he declared . " Leave us alone . We have 10 per cent of the Negroes of the United States in Georgia , and we treat them right . They know that " Lucy Randolph Mason of Atlanta , a CIO representative , pleaded for adoption of the measure . She was seconded by Charles Weber of ' the Virginia State CIO Council and Robert Eckhardt of Dallas , Tex. , // representing the Communication Workers of America . Those who apposed the resolution included Volney Andrews of ' the West Virginia Federation of Labor , AFL , and Milton R. Stevens of Washington , D. C. , representing the AFL Plasterers Union . For Fewer Hours in Coal Mines A fairly routine resolution favoring a maximum eight-hour day was reported to the conference but was sidetracked after a plea by a delegate from the United Mine Workers of America , William Blizzard of West Virginia , president of District No. 17 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operators , Mr. Blizzard said : " We hope to be able to make it a six or seven hour day , portal to portal . Do n't handicap the labor ' movement by going on record for an eight-hour day . " The delegates , nan to the conference by the Governors of their respective states , favored Federal and state minimum wage laws of $1 an hour , with overtime of at least time and a half rates after Ian eight-hour day and forty-hour week . The decision to press for $1 an hour is 25 cents above that advocated at recent conventions of the major labor organizations . Former Secretary Perkins , who was presented by her successor , Maurice J. Tobin , hoped to see the Labor Department administer all matters relating to the wageearner 's welfare . She advised the delegates to stand firm against proposals that a possible health department take over certain functions relating to industrial hygiene . The delegates laughed when she recounted how startled she had been to read a suggestion that " trained psychiatrists take over the whole problem of industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to the boss and asking for certain demands , " she added . " I would see the boss shake them warmly by the hand and say , I 'd like to have you see our psychiatrist . ' " Compromise on Wagner Act Dissatisfaction over the wording of a resolution on labor legislation which cropped uIp yesterday was ironed out by a statement which favored new Federal legislation " under which employes shall have the right to self organization , to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosirfg , and to engage in concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual protection as provided for in the Wagner Act . " By omitting a specific suggestion to re-enact the Wagner Act as such the compromise saved the sensibilities of those who felt that ' some changes in the 1935 law were in order . This substitute also cleared up the language of a section which ' had caused disagreement yesterday . The new phrasing stated that " whenever there is a conflict between Federal and state legislation concerning this right ( of collective bargaining ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Labor John W. Gibson , who presided , closed the sessions by expressing the opinion that the conference " rated high " in the fifteen-year history of these meetings .
