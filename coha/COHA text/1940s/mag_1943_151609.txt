Many an honest U.S. newspaperman was outraged last week by flashy , pompous New York Daily News Columnist John O'Donnell , whose hatred for Franklin Roosevelt* and all his works sometimes leads him to flout the standards of his own profession . O'Donnell wrote , as a plain statement of fact , that contraceptives and prophylactic equipment were to become Government Issue for the WAACs . <P> For days Washington and the U.S. Lave hissed with rumors of WAAC immorality and misconduct , which have made many women reluctant to enlist . O'Donnell gave the rumors wings and beak , reporting the rumors and then refuting them in such a way as to leave doubt whether he was taking it back or not . <P> His last report came , O'Donnell admitted later , from the usual " intelligent and trustworthy official . " O'Donnell saw it as " ... a victory for the New Deal ladies who think that girls who want to go into uniform and fight . . . have the same right here and abroad to indulge their passing fancies . " He also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You men think that there is nothing wrong if a soldier sleeps with a girl so long as he keeps his health . Well , the same argument goes both ways . " <P> Up rose Director Oveta Gulp Hobby : " There is absolutely no foundation of truth in the statement . " Tough old War Secretary Henry L. Stimson was moved to issue a formal statement : " ... I have made a thorough investigation of all these rumors. * They are completely false . . . . Anything which would interfere with WAAC recruiting or destroy the reputation of this corps and , by so doing , interfere with increase in combat strength of our Army , would aid the enemy . . . . " <P> Even this poke-in-the-nose failed to draw a retraction from O'Donnell , whose unsubstantiated blockbuster was a Jcruel blow to the WAACs and the war effort . <P> The Army wanted more WAACs ( 500,000 have been requisitioned ) to release more men for combat , Congress was considering bills to make them a part of the regular Army , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as England cud long ago , that womanpower is essential to the armed forces in total war . O'Donnell 's rumormongering was not calculated to speed that discovery . <P> <P> *On Dec. 18 , 1942 , the President was so displeased over an article O'Donnell wrote-facetiously sniping at U.S. censorship-that he informally awarded him a German Iron Cross . *Sample rumor : many pregnant WAACs have been shipped home from North Africa . Fact : three of 250 have been sent home , for 1 ) unsuitable temperament , 2 ) gall-bladder ailment , 3 ) legitimate childbirth .
