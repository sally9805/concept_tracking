AFTER MANY A SUMMER A NOVEL IN FIVE PARTS PART THREE BY ALDOUS I-IUXLEY mins Friday , Mr. Stoytc 's afternoon I in town had been exceptionally uneventful . Things went so smoothly that Mr. Stoyte was through with all his business more than an hour before he had expected . Finding himself with time to spare , he stopped on the way home at his agent 's to find out what was happening on the estate . The interview lasted only a few minutes  --  long enough , however , to put Mr. Stoyte in a fury that sent him rushing out to the car . " Drive to Mr. Propter 's , " he ordered with a peremptory ferocity as he slammed the door . What the hell did Bill Propter think he was doing ? he kept indignantly asking himself . Shoving his nose into other people 's business . And all on account of those lousy bums who had come to pick the oranges ! All for those tramps , those stinking , filthy hoboes ! Mr. Stoyte had a peculiar hatred for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harvesting of his crops , a hatred that was more than the rich man 's ordinary dislike of the poor . Not that he did n't experience that complex mixture of fear and physical disgust , of stifled compassion and shame transformed by repression into chronic exasperation . He did . But over and above this common and generic dislike for poor people , he was moved by other hatreds of his own . Mr. Stoytc was a rich man who had been poor . In the six years between the time when he ran awayfrom his father and grandmother in Nashville and the time when he had been adopted by the black sheep of the family , his Uncle Tom , in California , Jo Stoyte had learned , as he imagined , everything there was to be known about being poor . Those years had left him with an ineradicable hatred for the circumstances of poverty and at the same time an ineradicable contempt for all those who had been too stupid , or too weak , or too unlucky to climb out of the hell into which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , not only because they were potentially a menace to his position in society , not only because their misfortunes demanded a sympathy he did not wish to give , but also because they reminded him of what he himself had suffered in the past and , at the same time , because the fact that they were still poor was a sufficient proof of their contemptibleness and his own superiority . And since he had suffered what they were now suffering , it was only right that they should go on suffering what he had suffered . Also , since their continued poverty proved them contemptible , it was proper that he , who was now rich , should treat them in every way as the contemptible creatures they had shown themselves to be . Such was the logic of Mr. Stoyte 's emotions . And here was Bill Propter running counter to this logic by telling the agent that they ought n't to take advantage of the glut of transient labor to force down wages ; that they ought , on the contrary , to raise them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when these bums were swarming over the State like a plague of Mormon crickets ! " I 'll let him have it , " he whispered to himself . " I 'll let him have it . " Fifty years before , Bill Propter had been the only boy in the school who , even though he was the older and stronger , did n't make fun of him for being fat . They had met again when Bill was teaching at Berkeley and he himself had made good in the real estate game and had just gone into oil . Partly in gradtude for the way Bill Propter had acted when they were boys , partly also in order to display his power , to redress the balance of superiority in his own favor , Jo Stoyte had wanted to do something handsome for the young assistant professor . But in spite of his modest salary and the two or three miserable thousand dollars a year his father had left him , Bill Propter had n't wanted anything done for him . He had seemed genuinely grateful , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want to come in on the ground floor of Consol Oil  --  did n't want to because , as he kept explaining , he had all he needed and preferred not to have anything more . Jo 's effort to redress the balance of superiority had failed  --  failed disastrously , because by refusing his offer Bill had done something which , though he called him a fool for doing it , compelled Jo Stoyte secretly to admire him more than ever . Extorted against his will , this admiration bred a corresponding resentment toward its object . Jo Stoyte felt aggrieved that Bill had given him so many reasons for liking him . Ile would have preferred to like him without a reason , in spite of his shortcomings . It was because Bill had settled down on a ten-acre patch of land in this part of the valley that Mr. Stoyte had decided to build his castle on the site where it now stood . He wanted to be near Bill Propter , even though , in practice , there was almost nothing that Bill could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exasperation had been fanned by Mr. Stoyte 's hatred of the transients into a passion of fury . " I 'll let him have it , " he repeated again and again . The car came to a halt and , before the chauffeur could open the door for him , Mr. Stoyte had darted out and was hurrying in his determined way , looking neither to right nor left , up the path that led from the road to his old friend 's bungalow . " Hullo , Jo , " a familiar voice called from the shadow under the eucalyptus trees . Mr. Stoyte turned , peered through the twilight , then , without a word , hurried toward the bench on which the three men were sitting . There was a chorus of " Good evenings , " and as he approached , Pete rose politely and offered him his place . Ignoring his gesture and his very presence , Mr. Stoyte addressed himself immediately to Bill Propter . " Why the hell ca n't you leave my man alone ? " lie almost shouted . Mr. Propter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was used to these outbursts from poor Jo ; he had long since divined their fundamental cause and knew by experience how to deal with them . " Which man , Jo ? " he asked . " Bob Hansen of course . What do you mean by going to him behind my back ? " " When I went to you , " said Mr. Propter , " you told me it was Hansen 's business . So I went to Hansen . " This was so infuriatingly true that Mr. Stoyte could only resort to roaring . He roared , " Interfering with him in his work ! What 's the idea ? " " Pete 's offering you a seat , " Mr. Propter put in . " I 'm not going to sit down , " Mr. Stoyte bellowed . " And I want an answer . What 's the idea ? " " The idea ? " Mr. Propter repeated in his slow quiet way . " Well , it 's quite an old one , you know . I did n't invent it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the idea that men and women are human beings . Not vermin . " " Those bums of yours ! " Mr. Propter turned to Pete . " You may as well sit down again , " he said . " Those lousy bums ! I tell you I wo n't stand it . " " Besides , " Mr. Propter went on , " I 'm a practical man . You 're not . " " Me not practical ? " Mr. Stoyte echoed with indignant amazement . " Not practical ? Well , look at the place I live in and then look at this dump of yours . " " Exactly . That proves the point . You 're hopelessly romantic , Jo ; so romantic , you think people can work when they have n't had enough to eat . " " You 're trying to make Communists of them . " The word Communist renewed Mr. Stoyte 's passion and at the same time justified it ; his indignation ceased to be merely personal and became righteous . " You 're nothing but a Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed , just as Pete 's had trembled half an hour before , at the words " Fascist aggression . " " I thought we were talking about eating , " said Mr. Propter . " You 're stalling ! " " Eating and working  --  was n't that it ? " " I 've put up with you all these years , " Mr. Stoyte went on , " for old times ' sake . But now I 'm through . I 'm sick of you . Talking Communism to those bums ! Making the place dangerous for decent people to live in . " " Decent ? " Mr. Propter echoed , and was tempted to laugh , but immediately checked the impulse . " I 'll have you run out of the valley , " Mr. Stoyte was roaring . " I 'll see that you 're . . . " He broke off in the middle of the sentence and stood there for a few seconds in silence , his mouth still open and working , his eyes staring . That drumming in the ears , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him of his blood pressure , of Dr. Obispo , of death . Mr. Stoyte drew a deep breath , pulled out his handkerchief , wiped his face and neck , then , without uttering another word , turned and began to walk away . Mr. Propter got up , hurried after him and , in spite of the other 's angry motion of recoil , took Mr. Stoyte 's arm and walked along beside him . " I want to show you something , Jo , " he said . " Something that 'll interest you , I think . " " I do n't want to see it , " said Mr. Stoyte between his false teeth . Mr. Propter paid no attention , but continued to lead him toward the back of the house . " It 's a gadget that Abbot of the Smithsonian has been working on for some time , " he continued . " A thing for making use of solar energy . " He interrupted himself for a moment to call back to the others to follow him . " Much more compact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , " he said . " Much more efficient too . " And he went on to describe the system of trough-shaped reflectors , the tubes of oil heated to a temperature of four or five hundred degrees Fahrenheit ; the boiler for raising steam , if you wanted to run a low-pressure engine ; the cooking range and water heater , if you were using it only for domestic purposes . " Pity the sun 's down , " he said , as they stood in front of the machine . " I 'd have liked to show you the way it works the engine . I 've had two horse-power , eight hours a day , ever since I got the thing working last week . " Mr. Stoyte had intended to persist in his silence  --  just to show Bill that he was still angry , that he had n't forgiven him ; but his interest in the machine and , above all , his exasperated concern with Bill 's idiotic , crackpot notions were too much for him . " What the hell do you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " To run my electric generator . " " But what do you want with an electric generator ? Have n't you got your current wired in from the city ? " " Of course . And I 'm trying to see how far I can be independent of the city . " " But what for ? " Mr. Propter uttered a little laugh . " Because I believe in Jeffersonian de-mocracy . " " What the hell has Jeffersonian democracy got to do with it ? " said Mr. Stoyte with mounting irritation . " Ca n't you believe in Jefferson and have your current wired in from the city ? " " That 's exactly it , " said Mr. Propter ; " you almost certainly ca n't . " " What do you mean ? " " What I say , " Mr. Propter answered . " I believe in democracy too , " Mr. Stoyte announced with a look of defiance . " I know you do . And you also believe in being the undisputed boss in all your businesses . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name for an undisputed boss , " said Mr. Propter . " ' Dictator . ' " " What are you trying to get at ? " " Merely at the facts . You believe in democracy ; but you 're at the head of businesses which have to be run dictatorially . And your subordinates have to accept your dictatorship because they 're dependent on you for their living . In Russia they 'd depend on government officials for their living . Perhaps you think that 's an improvement , " he added , turning to Pete . Pete nodded . " I 'm all for the public ownership of the means of production , " he said . It was the first time he had openly confessed his faith in the presence of his employer ; he felt happy at having dared to be a Daniel . " Public ownership of the means of production , " Mr. Propter repeated . " But unfortunately governments have a way of regarding the individual producers as being parts of the means . Frankly , I 'd rather have Jo Stoyte as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he laid his hand on Mr. Stoyte 's shoulder ) " this Jo ca n't have you executed ; he ca n't send you to the Arctic ; he ca n't prevent you from getting a job under another boss . Whereas the other Jo . . . " he shook his head . " You 'd be fired pretty quick , " growled Mr. Stoyte . " I do n't want any boss , " Mr. Propter went on . " The more bosses the less democracy . But unless people can support themselves they 've got to have a boss who 'll undertake to do it for them . So the less self-support the less democracy . In Jefferson 's day a great many Americans did support themselves . They were economically independent . Independent of government and independent of big business . Hence the Constitution . " " We 've still got the Constitution , " said Mr. Stoyte . " No doubt , " Mr. Propter agreed . " But if we had to make a new Constitution to-day what would it be like ? A Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detroit ; of United States Steel and the Public Utilities and General Motors and the C.I.D . and the government departments . What on earth would it be like ? " he repeated . " We respect our old Constitution , but in fact we live under a new one . And if we want to live under the first we 've got to re-create something like the conditions under which the first was made . That 's why I 'm interested in this gadget . " He patted the frame of the machine . " Because it may help to give independence to anyone who desires independence . Not that many do desire it , " he added parenthetically . " The propaganda in favor of dependence is too strong . They 've come to believe that you ca n't be happy unless you 're entirely dependent on government or centralized business . But for the few who do care about democracy , who really want to be free in the Jeffersonian sense , this thing may be a help . If it makes them independent of fuel and power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked anxious . " Do you really think it 'll do that ? " " Why not ? " said Mr. Propter . " There 's a lot of sunshine running to waste in this part of the country . " Mr. Stoyte thought of his presidency of the Consol Oil Company . " It wo n't be good for the oil business , " he said . " I should hate it to be good for the oil business , " Mr. Proptcr answered cheerfully . " And what about coal ? " He had an interest in a group of West Virginia mines . " And the railroads ? " There was that big block of Union Pacific shares that had belonged to Prudence . " The railroads ca n't get on without long hauls . And steel , " he added disinterestedly ; for his holdings in Bethlehem Steel were almost negligible . " What happens to steel if you hurt the railroads and cut down trucking ? You 're going against progress , " he burst out in another access of righteous indignation . " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jo , " said Mr. Propter . " It wo n't affect your dividends for quite a long while . There 'll be plenty of time to adjust to the new conditions . " With an admirable effort Mr. Stoytc controlled his temper . " You seem to figure I ca n't think of anything but money , " he said with dignity . " Well , it may interest you to know that I 've decided to give Mr. Mulge another thirty thousand dollars for his Art School . " ( The decision had been made there and then , for the sole purpose of serving as a weapon in the perennial battle with Bill Propter . ) " And if you think , " he added as an afterthought , " if you think I 'm only concerned with my own interests , read the special World 's Fair number of the . Yew York Times . Read that , " he insisted with the solemnity of a fundamentalist recommending the Book of Revelation . " You 'll see that the most forward-looking men in the country think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incongruous unction , in the phraseology of after-dinner eloquence . " The way of progress is the way of better organization , more service from business , more goods for the consumer ! " Then , incoherently , " Look at the way a housewife goes to her grocer , " he added , " and buys a package of some nationally advertised cereal or something . That'sprogress . Not your crackpot idea of doing everything at home with this idiotic contraption . " Mr. Stoyte had reverted completely to his ordinary style . " You always were a fool , Bill , and I guess you always will be . And remember what I told you about interfering with Bob Hansen . I wo n't stand for it . " In dramatic silence he walked away ; but after taking a few steps , he halted and called back over his shoulder , " Come up to dinner if you feel like it . " " Thanks , " said Mr. Propter . " I will . " Mr. Stoyte walked briskly toward his car . He had forgotten about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a sudden unaccountably and unreasonably happy . It was not that he had scored any notable success in his battle with Bill Propter . He had n't ; and , what was more , in the process of not scoring a success he had made , and was even half aware that he had made , a bit of a fool of himself . The source of his happiness was elsewhere . He was happy , though he would never have admitted the fact , because , in spite of everything , Bill seemed to like him . In the car as he drove back to the castle he whistled to himself . Entering with his hat on , as usual ( for even after all these years he still derived a childish pleasure from the contrast between the palace in which he lived and the proletarian manners he affected ) , Mr. Stoyte crossed the great hall , stepped into the elevator and , from the elevator , walked directly into Virginia 's boudoir . When he opened the door the two were sitting at least fifteen feet apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chocolate and banana split ; seated in an elegant pose on one of the pink satin armchairs , Dr. Obispo was in the process of lighting a cigarette . On Mr. Stoyte the impact of suspicion and jealousy was like the blow of a fist directed straight to the solar plexus . His face contracted as though with pain . And yet he had seen nothing ; there was no apparent cause for jealousy , no visible reason in their attitudes , their actions , their expressions for suspicion . Dr. Obispo 's manner was perfectly easy and natural ; and the Baby 's smile of startled and delighted welcome was angelic in its candor . " Uncle Jo ! " She ran to meet him and threw her arms round his neck . " Uncle Jo ! " The warmth of her tone , the softness of her lips had a magical effect on Mr. Stoyte . The fact that he should have felt suspicious , even for a moment , of this pure and adorable , this deliciously warm , resilient , and perfumed child , filled him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fire on his head . " I was a bit worried , " he said , as he got up from his chair , " by the way you coughed after lunch . That 's why came up here , to make sure of catching you the moment you got in . " He put a hand in his pocket and , after half drawing out and immediately replacing a little leather-bound volume , like a prayer book , extracted a stethoscope . " Prevention 's better than cure , " he went on . " I 'm not going to let you get influenza if I can help it . " Remembering what a good week they had had at the Beverly . Pantheon on account of the epidemic , Mr. Stoyte felt alarmed . " I do n't feel bad , " he said . " I guess that cough was n't anything . Only my old  --  you know  --  the chronic bronchitis . " " Maybe it was only that . But all the same I 'd like to listen in . " Briskly professional , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's right , Uncle Jo , " said the Baby . Touched by so much solicitude and at the same time rather disturbed by the thought that it might perhaps be influenza , Mr. Stoyte took off his coat and waistcoat and began to undo his tie . A moment later he was standing stripped to the waist under the crystals of the chandelier . Modestly Virginia retired again to her soda fountain . Dr. Obispo slipped the ends of the curved nickel tubes of the stethoscope into his ears . " Take a deep breath , " he said as he pressed the muzzle against Mr. Stoyte 's chest . " Again , " he ordered . " Now cough . " Looking past that thick barrel of hairy flesh , he could see on the wall behind the inhabitants of Watteau 's mournful paradise as they prepared to set sail for some other paradise , doubtless yet more heartbreaking . " Say ninety-nine , " Dr. Obispo commanded , returning from the embarkation for Cythera to a near view of Mr. Stoyte 's thorax and abdomen . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ninety-nine . " With professional thoroughness Dr. Obispo shifted the muzzle of his stethoscope from point to point on the curving barrel of flesh before him . There was nothing wrong of course with the old buzzard . Just the familiar set of rates and wheezes he always had . Perhaps it would make things a bit more realistic if he were to take the creature down to his office and stick him up in front of the fluoroscope . But , no ; he really could n't be bothered . And , besides , this , farce would be quite enough . " Just a few more deep breaths , if you do n't mind . " Wheezily Mr. Stoyte inhaled , then with a snorting sigh emptied his lungs . XI There was silence after Mr. Stoyte 's departure . A long silence , while each of the three men thought his own private thoughts . It was Pete who spoke first . " Things like that , " he said gloomily , " they get me kind of wondering if I ought to go on taking his money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were me ? " " What would I do ? " Mr. Propter reflected for a moment . " I 'd go on working in Jo 's laboratory , " he said . " But only so long as I felt fairly certain that what I was doing would n't cause more harm than good . " " And what about the money ? " Pete went on . " Seeing where it comes from and who it belongs to , do you think I ought to take it ? " " All money 's pretty dirty , " said Mr. Propter . " I do n't know that poor Jo 's is appreciably dirtier than anyone else 's . You may think it is ; but that 's only because , for the first time , you 're seeing money at its source  --  its personal , human source . You 're like one of those city children who have been used to getting their milk in sterilized bottles from a shiny white delivery wagon . When they go into the country and see it being pumped out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrified , they 're disgusted . It 's the same with money , You 've been used to getting it from behind a bronze grating in a magnificent marble bank . Now you 've come out into the country and are living in the cow shed with the animal that actually secretes the stuff . And the process does n't strike you as very savory or hygienic . But the same process was going on even when you did n't know about it . And if you were n't working for Jo Stoyte you 'd probably be working for some college or university . But where do colleges and universities get their money from ? From rich men . In other words , from people like Jo Stoyte . Again , it 's dirt served out in sterile containers  --  by a gentleman in a cap and gown this time . " " So you figure it 's all right for me to go on like I am now ? " said Pete . " All right , " Mr. Propter answered , " in the sense that it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was glad to hear that Dr. Mulge had got his art school , " he said in another , lighter tone . " Immediately after the Auditorium too . It 's a lot of money . But I suppose the prestige of being a patron of learning is worth it . And of course there 's an enormous social pressure on the rich to make them become patrons of learning . They 're being pushed by shame as well as pulled by the longing to believe they 're the benefactors of humanity . And happily with Dr. Mulge a rich man can have hiskudos with safety . No amount of art schools at Tarzana will ever disturb the status quo . Whereas if I were to ask Jo for fifty thousand dollars to finance research into the technic of democracy he 'd turn me down flat . Why ? Because he knows that sort of thing is dangerous . He likes speeches about democracy . But he does n't approve of the coarse materialists who try to find out how to put those ideals into practice . You saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because , in its tiny way , it 's a menace to the sort of big business he makes his money from . And it 's the same with these other little gadgets that I 've talked to him about from time to time . " Mr. Propter went into the bungalow for a moment to turn out the lights , then emerged again on to the porch . Together , the three men walked down the path to the road . Before them the castle was a vast black silhouette punctured by occasional lights . " There is something you can do , " Mr. Propter resumed ; " but only on condition that you know what the nature of the world happens to be . If you know that the strictly human level is the level of evil , you wo n't waste your time trying to produce good on that level . Good manifests itself only on the animal level and on the level of eternity . Knowing that , you 'll realize that the best you can do on the human level is preventive . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much with the manifestation of good on the other levels . That 's all . But politicians do n't know the nature of reality . If they did they would n't be politicians . Reactionary or revolutionary , they 're all humanists , all romantics . They live in a world of illusion , a world that 's a mere projection of their own human personalities . They act in ways which would be appropriate if such a world as they think they live in really existed . But unfortunately it does n't exist except in their imaginations . Hence nothing that they do is appropriate to the real world . All their 41610001400141 0400414***4 actions are the actions of lunatics , and all , as history is there to demonstrate , are more or less completely disastrous . So much for the romantics . The realists who have studied the nature of the world know that an exclusively humanistic attitude toward life is always fatal , and that all strictly human activities must therefore be made instrumental to animal and spiritual good . They know , in other words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe for animals and spirits . At present , I 'm afraid , it 's profoundly unfit . The world we 've made for ourselves is a world of sick bodies and insane or criminal personalities . How shall we make this world safe for ourselves as animals and as spirits ? If we can answer that question we 've discovered what to do . " Mr. Propter halted at what appeared to be a wayside shrine , opened a small steel door with a key he carried in his pocket , and , lifting the receiver of the telephone within , announced their presence to an invisible porter , somewhere on the other side of the moat . They walked on . " What are the things that make the world unsafe for animals and spirits ? " Mr. Propter continued . " Obviously , greed and fear , lust for power , hatred , anger . . . " At this moment , a dazzling light struck them full in the face and was almost immediately turned out . " What in heaven 's name ? It Jeremy began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They only want to make sure it 's us , not a set of gangsters . It 's just the searchlight . " " Just our old friend Jo expressing his personality , " said Mr. Proptcr , taking Jeremy 's arm . " In other words , proclaiming to the world that he 's afraid because he 's been greedy and domineering . And he 's been greedy and domineering , among other reasons , because the present system puts a premium on those qualities . Our problem is to find a system that will give the fewest possible opportunities for unfortunate people like Jo Stoyte to realize their potentialities . " The bridge had swung down as they approached the moat , and now the boards rang hollow under their feet . The portcullis rose , the gates slid hack to receive them . " If you want to make the world safe for animals and spirits you must have a system that reduces the amount of fear and greed and hatred and domineering to their minimum , which means that you must have enough economic security to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enough personal responsibility to prevent people from wallowing in sloth . Enough property to protect them from being bullied by the rich , but not enough to permit them to bully . And the same thing with political rights and authority ? enough of the first for the protection of the many , too little of the second for domination by the few . " " Sounds like peasants to me , " said Pete dubiously . " Peasants plus small machines and power . Which means that they 're no longer peasants , except in so far as they 're largely self-sufficient . " " And who makes the machines ? More peasants ? " " No ; the same sort of people as make them now . What ca n't be made satisfactorily except by mass production methods obviously has to go on being made that way . About a third of all production  --  that 's what it seems to amount to . The other two-thirds are more economically produced at home or in a small workshop . The immediate , practical problem is to work out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research is going to the discovery of new fields for mass production . " " And do you figure people will want to leave the cities and live the way you 're telling us , on little farms ? " " Ah , now you 're talking , Pete ! " said Mr. Proptcr approvingly . " Frankly , then , I do n't expect them to leave the cities any more than I expect them to stop having wars and revolutions . All I expect is that if I do my work and it 's reasonably good there 'll be a few people who will want to collaborate with me . That 's all . " " But if you 're not going to get more than just a few , what 's the point ? Why not try to do something with the cities and the factories , seeing that that 's where most people are going to stay ? Would n't that be more practical ? " " It depends how one defines the word , " said Mr. Propter . " For example , you seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to pursue a policy which is known to be fatal ; but that it is n't practical to help a very few people to pursue a policy which there is every reason to regard as sound . I do n't agree with you . " " But the many are there . You 've got to do something about them . " " You 've got to do something about them , " Mr. Propter agreed . " But at the same time there are circumstances in which you ca n't do anything . You ca n't do anything effective about anyone if he does n't choose or is n't able to collaborate with you in doing the right thing . For example , you 've got to help people who are being killed off by malaria . But in practice you ca n't help them if they refuse to screen their windows and insist on taking walks near stagnant water in the twilight . It 's exactly the same with the diseases of the body politic . You 've got to help people if they 're faced by war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menace of sudden revolution or slow degeneration . You 've got to help . But the fact remains , nevertheless , that you ca n't help if they persist in the course of behavior which originally got them into their trouble . For example , you ca n't preserve people from the horrors of war if they wo n't give up the pleasures of nationalism . You ca n't save them from slumps and depressions so long as they go on thinking exclusively in terms of money and regarding money as the supreme good . You ca n't avert revolution and enslavement if they will identifyprogress with the increase of centralization and prosperity with the intensifying of mass production . You ca n't preserve them from collective madness and suicide if they persist in paying divine honors to ideals which are merely projections of their own personalities in other words , if they persist in worshipping thernseives rather than God . So much for conditional clauses . Now let 's consider the actual facts of the present situation . For our purposes the most significant facts arc these : the inhabitants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be saved from impending disaster ; the overwhelming majority refuse to change the habits of thought , feeling , and action which are directly responsible for their present plight . In other words , they ca n't be helped because they are not prepared to collaborate with any helper who proposes a rational and realistic course of action . In these circumstances what ought the would-be helper do ? " " He 's got to do something , " said Pete . " Even if he thereby accelerates the process of destruction ? " Mr. Propter smiled sadly . " Doing for doing 's sake , " he went on . " I prefer Oscar Wilde . Bad art ca n't do so much harm as ill-considered political action . Doing good on any but the tiniest scale requires more intelligence than most people possess . They ought to be content with keeping out of mischief ; it 's easier and it does n't have such frightful results as trying to do good in the wrong way . Twiddling the thumbs and having good manners are much more helpful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing things . " Floodlighted , Giambologna 's nymph was still indefatigably spouting away against the velvet background of the darkness . Electricity and sculpture , Jeremy was thinking as he looked at her ? predestined partners . The things that old Bcrnini could have done with a battery of projectors ! " No , " Mr. Propter was saying in answer to a protesting question from the AFTER MANY A SUMMER 2u5 young man , " no , I certainly would n't advise their abandonment . I 'd advise the constant reiteration of the truths they 've been told again and again during the past three thousand years . And , in the intervals , I 'd do active work on the technics of a better system , and I 'd colIaboratc with the few who understand what the system is and are ready to pay the price demanded for its realization . Incidentally , the price , measured in human terms , is enormously high , though of course much lower than the price demanded by the nature of things from those who persist in behaving in the standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example  --  particularly war with contemporary weapons . Much lower than the price of economic depression and political enslavement . " " And what happens , " Jeremy asked in a fluting voice , " what happens when you 've had your war ? Will the few be any better off than the many ? " " Oddly enough , " Mr. Propter answered , " there 's just a chance they may be . For this reason . If they 've learned the technic of self-sufficiency they 'll find it easier to survive a time of anarchy than the people who depend for their livelihood on a highly centralized and specialized organization . You ca n't work for the good without incidentally preparing yourself for the worst . " XII In the columned Lady Chapel , with its hatracks and its Magnascos , its Brancusi and its Etruscan sarcophagus used as an umbrella stand , Jeremy Pordage began , all of a sudden , to feel himself more cheerful and at home . " It 's as though one were walking into the mind of a lunatic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat and followed the others into the great hall . " Or , rather , an idiot , " he qualified . " Because I suppose a lunatic 's a person with a one-track mind . Whereas this ? " he made a circular gesture " this is ano-track mind . No-track because infinity-track . It 's the mind of an idiot of genius . Positively stuffed with the best that has been thought and said . " He pronounced the phrase with a kind of old-maidish precision that made it sound entirely ludicrous . " Greece , Mexico , backsides , crucifixions , machinery , George IV , Amida Buddha , science , Christian science , Turkish baths  --  anything you like to mention . And every item is perfectly irrelevant to every other item . " He rubbed his hands together , he twinkled delightedly through his bifocals . " Disquieting at first . But do you know ? I 'm beginning to enjoy it . I find I really rather like living inside an idiot . " " I do n't doubt it , " said Mr. Propter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jeremy was offended . " One would n't have thought this sort of thing was very common , " he said , nodding in the direction of the Greco . " It is n't , " Mr. Propter agreed . " But you can live in an idiot-universe without going to the expense of actually constructing it out of ferro-concrete and filling it with works of art . " There was a pause while they entered the lift . " You can live inside a cultural idiot , " Mr. Propter went on . " Inside a patchwork of mutually irrelevant words and bits of information . Or , if you 're a lowbrow , you can live in the idiot world of the Jimmie moyen sensuel  --  the world where the irrelevances consist of newspapers and baseball , of sex and worry , of advertising and money and halitosis and keeping up with the Joneses . There 's a hierarchy of idiocies . Naturally you and I prefer the classiest variety . " The elevator came to a halt . Pete opened the gate , and they stepped out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an idiot-universe if you want a quiet irresponsible life . That is , provided you can stand the idiocy , " Mr. Propter added . " A lot of people ca n't . After a time they get tired of their no-track world . They feel the need of being concentrated and directed . They want their lives to have some sense . That 's when they go Communist or join the Church of Rome or take up with the Oxford Group . Anything provided it will make them one-trackers . And of course in the overwhelming majority of cases they choose the wrong track . Inevitably . Because there are a million wrong tracks and only one right  --  a million ideals , a million projections of personality , and only one God and one beatific vision . From no-track idiocy most of them pass on to some one-track lunacy , generally criminal . It makes them feel better of course ; but , pragmatically , the last state is always worse than the first . If you do n't want the only thing worth having , my advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work ? " he went on in another tone , as Jeremy opened the door of his vaulted study . " And those arc the Hauberk Papers , I take it . Plenty of them . The title 's extinct , is n't it ? " Jeremy nodded . " And so 's the family ? or very nearly . Nothing left but two old maids in a haunted house without any money . " He twinkled , uttered his little preparatory cough and , patting his bald crown , said with an exaggerated precision : " Decayed gentlewomen . " Exquisite locution ! It was one of his favorites . " And the decay must have gone pretty far , " he added . " Otherwise they would n't have sold the papers . They 've refused all previous offers . " " How fortunate one is not to belong to an ancient family ! " said Mr. Propter . " All those inherited loyalties to bricks and mortar , all those obligations to tombstones and bits of paper and painted canvases ! " He shook his head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meanwhile had crossed the room , opened a drawer , and returned with a file of papers which he handed to Mr. Propter . " Look at these . " Mr. Propter looked . " From Moli-nos ! " he said in surprise . " I thought that would be your cup of MAGAZINE tea , " said Jeremy , deriving a sly pleasure from talking about mysticism in the most absurdly inappropriate language . Mr. Propter smiled . " My cup of tea , " he repeated . " But not my favorite blend . There was something not quite right about poor Molinos . A strain of - how shall I put it ? ? of negative sensuality . He enjoyed suffering . Mental suffering , the dark night of the soul  --  he really wallowed in it . No doubt , poor fellow , he sincerely believed he was destroying self-will ; but without his being aware of it , he was always turning the process of destruction into another affirmation of self-will . Which was a pity , " Mr. Propter added , taking the letters to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he certainly did have some first-hand experience of reality . Which only shows that you 're never certain of getting there , even when you 've come near enough to see what sort of thing you 're going to . Here 's a fine sentence , " he put in parenthetically . " ' Arne a Dios , ' " he read aloud , " ' corno es en si y no coma se to dice y forma su imaginacion . ' " Jeremy almost laughed . The coincidence that Mr. Propter should have picked on the same passage that had caught Dr. Obispo 's eye that morning gave him a peculiar satisfaction . " Pity he could n't have read a little Kant , " he said . " Dios en si seems to be much the same as Ding an sick . Unknowable by the human mind . " " Unknowable by the personal human mind , " Mr. Propter agreed , " because personality is self-will , and self-will is the negation of reality , the denial of God . So far as the ordinary human personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing in itself is unknowable . Dios en si ca n't be comprehended by a consciousness dominated by an ego . But now suppose there were some way of eliminating the ego from consciousness . If you could do this you 'd get close to reality , you 'd be in a position to comprehend Dios en sz . Now the interesting thing is that , as a matter of brute fact , this can be done , has been done again and again . Kant 's blind alley is for people who choose to remain on the human level . If you choose to climb on to the level of eternity the impasse no longer exists . " There was a silence . Mr. Propter turned over the sheets , pausing every now and then to decipher a line or two of the fine calligraphy . " ' Tres maneras hay de silencio , ' " he read aloud after a moment . " ' El primero es de palabras , el segundo de deseos y el tercero de pensamientos . ' He writes nicely , do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his extraordinary success . How disastrous when a man knows how to say the wrong things in the right way ! Incidentally , " he added , looking up with a smile into Jeremy 's face , " how few great stylists have ever said any of the right things . That 's one of the troubles about education in the humanities . The best that has been thought and said . Very nice . But best in which way ? Alas , only in form . The content is generally deplorable . " He turned back to the letters . After a moment another passage caught his attention . ' Oita y leery el hombre racional estas espirituales materias , pew no Ilegera , dice San Pablo , a comprenderlas : Animalis homo non percipit ea quae runt spiritus . ' And not merely animalis homo , " Mr. Propter commented . " Also humanus homo . Indeed , above all humanus homo . And you might even add that humanus homo non percipit ea quae sunt animalis . In so far as we think as strictly human beings we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is above . And then there 's a further trouble . Suppose we stop thinking in a strictly human fashion ; suppose we make it possible for ourselves to have direct intuitions of the non-human realities in which , so to speak , we 're imbedded . Well and good . But what happens when we try to pass on the knowledge so acquired ? We 're floored . The only vocabulary at our disposal is a vocabulary primarily intended for thinking strictly human thoughts about strictly human concerns . But the things we want to talk about are non-human realities and non-human ways of thinking . Hence the radical inadequacy of all statements about our animal nature and , even more , of all statements about God or spirit , or eternity . " Jeremy uttered a little cough . " I can think of some pretty adequate statements about ? " he paused , beamed , caressed his polished scalp ? " well , about the more intime aspects of our animal nature , " he concluded demurely . His face suddenly clouded ; he had remembered his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what does their adequacy depend on ? " Mr. Propter asked . " Not so much on the writer 's skill as the reader 's response . The direct , animal intuitions are n't rendered by words ; the words merely remind you of your memories of similar experiences . Notus calor is what Virgil says when he 's talking about the sensations experienced by Vulcan in the embraces of Venus . Familiar heat . No attempt at description or analysis ; no effort to get any kind of verbal equivalence to the facts . Just a reminder . But that reminder is enough to make the passage one of the most voluptuous affairs in Latin poetry . Virgil left the work to his readers . And , by and large , that 's what most erotic writers are content to do . The few who try to do the work themselves have to flounder about with metaphors and similes and analogies . You know the sort of stuff ; fire , whirlwinds , heaven , darts . " " ' The vale of lilies , ' " Jeremy quoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Not to mention the expense of spirit in a waste of shame , " said Mr. Propter ; " and all the other figures of speech . An endless variety , with only one feature in common  --  they 're all composed of words which do n't connote any aspect of the subject they 're supposed to describe . " " Saying one thing in order to mean another , " Jeremy put in . " Is n't that one of the possible definitions of imaginative literature ? " " Maybe , " Mr. Propter answered . " But what chiefly interests me at the moment is the fact that our immediate animal intuitions have never been given any but the most summary and inadequate labels . We say ' red , ' for example , or ' pleasant , ' and just leave it at that without trying to find verbal equivalents for the various aspects of perceiving redness or experiencing pleasure . " " Well , is n't that because you ca n't go beyond ' red ' or ' pleasant ' ? " said Pete . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Like giraffes , " Jeremy added . " ' There ai n't no such animal , ' is what the rationalist says , when he 's shown its portrait . And then in it walks , neck and all ! " " You 're right , " said Mr. Propter . " A giraffe is an ultimate fact . You 've got to accept it whether you like it or not . But accepting the giraffe does n't prevent you from studying and describing it . And the same applies to redness or pleasure or notus calor . They can be analyzed , and the results of the analysis can be described by means of suitable words . But as a matter of historical fact , this has n't been done . " Pete nodded slowly . " Why do you figure that should be ? " he asked . " Well , " said Mr. Propter , " I should say it 's because men have always been more interested in doing and feeling than in understanding . Always too busy making good and having thrills and doing what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too busy with all this even to feel any desire to have an adequate verbal instrument for elucidating their experiences . Look at the languages we 've inherited incomparably effective in rousing violent and exciting emotions ; an ever-present help for those who want to get on in the world ; worse than useless for anyone who aspires to disinterested understanding . Hence , even on the strictly human level , the need for special impersonal languages like mathematics and technical vocabularies of the various sciences . Wherever men have felt the wish to understand they 've given up the traditional language and substituted for it another special language , more precise and , above all , less contaminated with self-interest . " Now , here 's a very significant fact . Imaginative literature deals mainly with the everyday life of men and women ; and the everyday life of men and women consists , to a large extent , of immediate animal experiences . But the makers of imaginative literature have never forged an impersonal , uncontaminated language for the elucidation of immediate experiences . They 're content to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their own and their reader 's memory . Every direct intuition is notus calor , with the connotation of the words left open , so to speak , for each individual reader to supply according to the nature of his or her particular experiences in the past . Simple , but not exactly scientific . But then people do n't read literature in order to understand ; they read it because they want to re-live the feelings and sensations which they found exciting in the past . Art can be a lot of things ; but in actual practice , most of it is merely the mental equivalent of alcohol and cant tharides . " Mr. Propter looked down again at the close-set lines of Molinos ' epistle . " Direr y leer4 el hombre racional estas espirituales materias , ' " he read out once more . " ' Pero non llegera a comprenderlas . ' He 'll hear and read these things , but he wo n't succeed in understanding them . And he wo n't succeed , " said Mr. Prop-ter , closing the file and handing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one of two excellent reasons . Either he has never seen the giraffes in question , and so , being an hombre racional , knows quite well that there ai n't no such animal ; or else he has had glimpses of the creatures , or has some other reason for believing in their existence , but ca n't understand what the experts say about them ; ca n't understand because of the inadequacy of the language in which the fauna of the spiritual world are ordinarily described . In other words , he either has n't had the immediate experience of eternity and so has no reason to believe that eternity exists ; or else he does believe that eternity exists , but ca n't make head or tail of the language in which it 's talked about by those who have had experience of it . Furthermore , when he wants to talk about eternity himself  --  and he may wish to do so either in order to communicate his own experiences to others or to understand them better , from the human point of view , himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For he recognizes that the existing language is unsuitable  --  in which case he has only two rational choices : to say nothing at all or to invent a new and better technical language of his own , a calculus of eternity , so to speak , a special algebra of spiritual experience ( and if he does invent it , nobody who has n't learned it will know what he 's talking about ) . So much for the first horn of the dilemma . The second horn is reserved for those who do n't recognize the inadequacy of the existing language or else who do recognize it , but are irrationally hopeful enough to take a chance with an instrument which they know to be worthless . These people will write in the existing language , and their writing will be , in consequence , more or less completely misunderstood by most of their readers . Inevitably , because the words they use do n't correspond to the things they 're talking about . Most of them are words taken from the language of everyday life . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human affairs . What happens when you apply words derived from that language to experiences on the plane of the spirit , the plane of timeless experience ? Obviously you create a misunderstanding ; you say what you did n't mean to say . " Pete interrupted him . " I 'd like an example , Mr. Propter , " he said . " All right , " the other answered . " Let 's take the commonest word in all religious literature : love . On the human level the word means  --  what ? Prac tically everything from Mother to the Marquis de Sade . " The name reminded Jeremy yet again of what had happened to the Cent-Vingt lours de Sodome . Really it was too insufferable ! The impudence of it . . . " We do n't even make the simple Greek distinction between erao and philo , eras and agate . With us everything is just love , whether it 's self-sacrificing or possessive , whether it 's friendship or lust or homicidal lunacy . It 's all just love , " he repeated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hopelessly ambiguous . And when you begin using it in relation to experiences on the level of eternity  --  well , it 's simply disastrous . The love of God . ' God 's love for us . ' The saint 's love for his fellows . ' What does the word stand for in such phrases ? And in what way is this related to what it stands for when it 's applied to a young mother suckling her baby ? Or to Romeo climbing into Juliet 's bedroom ? Or to Othello as he strangles Desdemona ? Or to the research worker who loves his science ? Or to the patriot who 's ready to die for his country  --  to die , and , in the meantime , to kill , steal , lie , swindle , and torture for it ? Is there really anything in common between what the word stands for in these contexts and what it stands for when one talks , let us say , of the Buddha 's love for all sentient beings ? Obviously , the answer is : No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word stands for a great many different states of mind and ways of behaving . Dissimilar in many respects but alike at least in this : they 're all accompanied by emotional excitement and they all contain an element of craving , whereas the most characteristic features of the enlightened person 's experience are serenity and disinterestedness . In other words , the absence of excitement and the absence of craving ! ' " The absence of excitement and the absence of craving , " Pete said to himself , while the image of Virginia in her yachting cap , riding her pink scooter , kneeling in her shorts under the arch of the Grotto , swam before his inward eye . " Distinctions in fact ought to be represented by distinctions in language , " Mr. Propter was saying . " If they 're not you ca n't expect to talk sense . In spite of which we insist on using one word to connote entirely different things . God is love , ' we say . The word 's the same as the one we use when we talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's children ' or ' being inspired by love of country . ' Consequently we tend to think that the thing we 're talking about must be more or less the same . We imagine in a vague , reverential way , that God is composed of a kind of immensely magnified yearning . " Mr. Propter shook his head . " Creating God in our own image . It flatters our vanity , and of course we prefer vanity to understanding . Hence those confusions of language . If we wanted to understand the world , if we wanted to think about it realistically , we should say that we were in love , but that God was x-Iove . In this way people who had never had any first-hand experience on the level of eternity would at least be given a chance of knowing intellectually that what happens on that level is not the same as what happens on the strictly human level . They 'd know , because they 'd seen it in print , that there was some kind of difference between love and x-love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for imagining that God was like themselves , only a bit more so on the side of respectability and a bit less so of course on the other side . " And naturally what applies to the word ' Jove ' applies to all the other words taken over from the language of everyday life and used to describe spiritual experience . Words like knowledge , ' wisdom , ' power , " mind , " peace , " joy , " freedo m , ' good . ' They stand for certain things on the human level . But the things that writers force them to stand for when they describe events on the level of eternity are quite different . Hence the use of them merely confuses the issue . They just make it all but impossible for anyone to know what 's being talked about . And meanwhile you must remember that these words from the language of everyday life are n't the only trouble-makers . People who write about experiences on the level of eternity also make use of technical phrases borrowed from various systems of philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience ? " said Pete . " Is n't that the special , scientific language you 've been talking about ? " " It 's an attempt at such an algebra , " Mr. Propter answered . " But unfortunately a very unsuccessful attempt . Unsuccessful because this particular algebra is derived from the language of metaphysics  --  bad metaphysics incidentally . The people who use it are committing themselves , whether they like it or not , to an explanation of the facts as well as a description . An explanation of actual experiences in terms of metaphysical entities , whose existence is purely hypothetical and ca n't be demonstrated . In other words , they 're describing the facts in terms of figments of the imagination ; they 're explaining the known in terms of the unknown . Take a few examples . Here 's one : ' ecstasy . ' It 's a technical term that refers to the soul 's ability to stand outside the body  --  and of course it carries the further implication that we know what the soul is and how it 's related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or take another instance , a technical term that is essential to the Catholic theory of mysticism , infused contemplation . ' Here the implication is that there 's somebody outside us who pours a certain kind of psychological experience into our minds . The further implication is that we know who that somebody is . Or consider even ' union with God . ' What it means depends on the upbringing of the speaker . It may mean ' union with the Jehovah of the Old Testament . ' Or it may mean union with the personal deity of orthodox Christianity . ' It may mean what it probably would have meant , say , to Eckhart , ' union with the impersonal Godhead of which the God of orthodoxy is an aspect and a particular limitation . ' Similarly , if you were an Indian , it might mean ' union with Isvara ' or union with Brahman . ' In every case the term implies a previous knowledge about the nature of things which are either completely unknowable , or at best only to be inferred from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describe . So there , " Mr. Prop-ter concluded , " you have the second horn of the dilemma  --  the horn on which all those who use the current religious vocabulary to describe their experiences on the level of eternity inevitably impale themselves . " " And the way between the horns ? " Jeremy questioned . " Is n't it the way of the professional psychologists who have written about mysticism ? They 've evolved a pretty sensible language . You have n't mentioned them . " " I have n't mentioned them , " said Mr. Propter , " for the same reason as in talking about beauty I should n't mention professional aestheticians who had never been inside a picture gallery . " " You mean , they do n't know what they 're talking about ? " Mr. Proptcr smiled . " I 'd put it another way , " he said . " They talk about what they know . But what they know is n't worth talking about . For what they know is only the literature of mysticism  --  not the experience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Jeremy concluded . His eyes twinkled behind his spectacles ; he smiled like a child , taking a sly triumph in some small consummation of naughtiness . " What fun it is when there is n't a way between ! " he went on . " It makes the world seem so deliciously cosy , when all the issues are barred and there 's nowhere to go to with all your brass bands and shining armor . Onward , Christian soldiers ! Forward , the Light Brigade ! Excelsior ! And all the time you 're just going round and round  --  head to tail , follow-my-Fuelirer  --  like Fabre 's caterpillars . That really gives me a great deal of pleasure ! " This time Mr. Proptcr laughed outright . " I 'm sorry to have to disappoint you , " he said . " But unfortunately there is a way between the horns . The practical way . You can go and find out what it means for yourself , by first-hand experience . Just as you can find out what El Green 's Crucifixion of St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hall . Only in this case I 'm afraid there is n't any elevator . You have to go up on your own legs . And make no mistake , " he added , turning to Pete , " there 's an awful lot of stairs.n Dr. Obispo straightened himself up , took the tubes of the stethoscope out of his ears and stowed the instrument away in his pocket along with the Cent-Ving1 fours de Sodome . " Anything bad ? " Mr. Stoyte asked anxiously . Dr. Obispo shook his head and gave him a smile of reassurance . " No influenza anyhow , " he said . " Just a slight intensification of the bronchial condition . I 'll give you something for it to-night before you go to bed . " Mr. Stoyte 's face relaxed into cheerfulness . " Glad it was only a false alarm , " he said and turned away to get his clothes , which were lying in a heap on the sofa under the Watteau . From her seat at the soda counter , Virginia let out a whoop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she cried . Then in another , graver tone , " You know , Uncle Jo , " she added , " he 'd got me panicked about that cough of yours . Panicked , " she repeated . Uncle Jo grinned triumphantly and slapped his chest so hard that its hairy , almost female accumulations of flesh shivered like jellies under the blow . " Nothing wrong with rne , " he boasted . Virginia watched him over the top of her glass as he got into his shirt and knotted his tie . The expression on her innocent young face was one of perfect serenity . But behind those limpid blue eyes her mind was simmering with activity . " Was that a close call ? " she kept saying to herself . " Gee , was it close ! " At the recollection of that sudden violent start at the sound of the elevator gate being opened , of that wild scramble as the footsteps approached along the corridor , she felt herself tingling with a delicious mixture of fear and amusement , of apprehension and triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful ! What presence of mind ! And that stethoscope thing he pulled out of his pocket  --  what a brain wave ! It had saved the situation ! Because , without the stethoscope , Uncle Jo would have put on one of his jealousy acts . Though what right he had to be jealous , Virginia went on to reflect , with a strong sense of injury , she really did n't know , seeing that nothing had happened except just a little reading aloud . And anyhow why should n't a girl be allowed to read that sort of thing if she wanted to ? Especially as it was in French . And , besides , who was Uncle Jo to be prudish , she 'd like to know ? Getting mad with people only for telling you a funny story , when just look what he himself was doing all the time  --  and then expecting you to talk like Louisa M. Alcott , and thinking you ought to be protected from hearing so much as a dirty word ! And the way he simply would n't allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had wanted to . Making a build-up of her as somebody quite different from what she really was . Acting almost as though she were Daisy Mae in the comic strip and he a sort of Little Abner rescuing her in the nick of time . Was he trying to spy on her ? Be-.cause , if so , she was n't going to stand for it ; if so , then it just served him right that that was what Sig had been reading to her . He was just getting what he deserved for snooping around , trying to catch her doing something that was n't right . Well , if that was how he was going to act , she 'd tell Sig to come every day and read another chapter . " Well , Baby , " said Mr. Stoyte , as he did up the last button of his waistcoat . " You 're not saying much , are you ? A penny for your thoughts . " Virginia raised that childishly short upper lip in a smile that made his heart melt with tenderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Jo , " she said . XIII Pete Boone was not even trying to get to sleep ; he was trying , on the contrary , to figure things out . To figure out science and Mr. Propter , social justice and eternity and Virginia and Anti-Fascism . It was n't easy . Because if Mr. Proptcr was right then you 'd have to start thinking quite differently about almost everything . " Disinterested quest for truth " ? that was what you said ( if you were ever forced to say anything so embarrassing ) about why you were a biologist . And in the case of Socialism it was " humanity , " it was " the greatest happiness of the greatest number , " it was " progress " ? and of course that linked up with biology again : happiness and progress through science as well as Socialism . And while happiness and progress were on the way there was loyalty to the cause . He remembered a piece about loyalty by Josiah Royce , a piece he had had to read in his sophomore year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own way some form of religious truth  --  winning some kind of genuine religious insight . It had made a big impression on him at the time . He had just lost his faith in that old Blood-of-theLamb business he 'd been brought up in , and this had come as a kind of reassurance , had made him feel that after all he was religious even if he did n't go to church any more  --  religious because he was loyal . Loyal to causes , loyal to friends . He had been religious , it had always seemed to him , over there in Spain . Religious , again , when he felt that way about Virginia . And yet , if Mr. Propter was right , old Royce 's ideas about loyalty were all wrong . Being loyal did n't of itself give you religious insight . On the contrary , it might pre-vent you from having insight  --  indeed , was absolutely certain to prevent you if you gave your loyalty to anything less than the highest cause of all ; and the highest cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible in its farness and strangeness . Almost terrible ; and yet the more he thought about it the more dubious he felt about everything else . Perhaps it really was the highest . But if it was then Socialism was n't enough . And it was n't enough because humanity was n't enough . Because the greatest happiness did n't happen to be in the place where people had thought it was , because you could n't make it come by doing things in the sort of fields you worked in if you were a social reformer . The best you could do in those fields was to make it easier for people to go on to where the greatest happiness could be had . And of course what applied to Socialism would apply to biology or any other science , if you thought of it as a means to progress . Because if Mr. Propter was right then what people called progress was n't progress . That is , it would n't be progress unless it had made it easier for people to go on to where the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be loyal to the highest cause of all . And , obviously , if that was your standard , you had to think twice about using progress as a justification for science . And then there was that disinterested quest for truth . But again , if Mr. Propter was right , biology and the rest were the disinterested quest for only one aspect of truth . But a half-truth was a falsehood , and it remained a falsehood even when you 'd told it in the belief that it was the whole truth . So it looked as though that justification would n't do either  --  or at any rate as though it would n't do unless you were at the same time disinterestedly trying to discover the other aspect of truth , the aspect you were looking for when you gave your loyalty to the highest cause of all . And meanwhile what about Virginia , he asked himself in mounting anguish , what about Virginia ? For , if Mr. Propter was right , then even Virginia was n't enough , even Virginia might actually be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest cause of all . Even those eyes and her innocence and that utterly adorable mouth ; even what he felt about her ; even love itself , even the best kind of love ( for he could honestly say that he hated the other kind  --  that dreadful brothel in Barcelona , for example , and here , at home , those huggings after the third or fourth cocktail , those gropings by the roadside in a parked car ) yes , even the best kind of love might be inadequate , might actually be worse than inadequate . " I could not love thee , dear , so much , loved I not something or other more . " Hitherto , something or other had been his biology , his Socialism . But now these had turned out to be inadequate , or even , taken as ends in themselves , worse than inadequate . No loyalty was good in itself , or brought religious insight , except loyalty to the highest cause of all . " I could not love thee , dear , so much , loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the question , the agonizing question , was this : Could you love the highest cause of all and go on feeling as you did about Virginia ? The worst love was obviously incompatible with loyalty to the highest cause of all . Obviously so ; because the worst love was just being loyal to your own physiology , whereas , if Mr. Propter was right , you could n't be loyal to the highest cause of all without denying such loyalties to yourself . But was the best love so fundamentally different after all from the worst ? The worst was being loyal to your physiology . It was hateful to admit it ; but so too was the best : being loyal to your physiology and at the same time ( which was its distinguishing mark ) loyal also to your higher feelings  --  to that empty ache of longing , to that infinity of tenderness , to that adoration , that happiness , those pains , that sense of solitude , that longing for identity . You were loyal to these , and being loyal to these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what people called romance and praised as the most wonderful thing in life . But being loyal to these was being loyal to yourself ; and you could n't be loyal to yourself and loyal at the same time to the highest cause of all . The practical conclusion was obvious . But Pete refused to draw it . Those eyes were blue and limpid , that mouth adorable in its innocence . And then how sweet she was , how beautifully thoughtful ! He remembered the conversation they had had on the way in to dinner . He had asked her how her headache was . " Do n't talk about it , " she had whispered ; " it might upset Uncle Jo . Doc 's been going over him with his stethoscope ; does n't think he 's so good this evening . I do n't want to have him worrying about me . And anyhow , what is a headache ? " Not only beautiful , not only innocent and sweet , but brave too and unselfish . And how adorable she had been to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling him about her home in Oregon , making him talk about his home down in El Paso . In the end Mr. Stoyte had come and sat down beside them  --  in silence , and his face black as thunder . Pete had glanced inquiringly at Virginia , and she had given him a look that said , " Please , go , " and another when he rose to say good-night , so pleadingly apologetic , so full of gratitude , so understanding , so sweet and affectionate , that the recollection of it was enough to bring the tears into his eyes . Lying there in the darkness , he cried with happiness . The last prayer had been said ; Virginia ruse from her knees . Happening to look down as she did so , she saw to her horror that some of the cyclamen-colored varnish had scaled off the nails of the second and third toes of her left foot . A minute later she was squatting on the floor beside the bed , the right leg outstretched , the other foot drawn across it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood beside her ; she held a small paint brush in her hand , and a horribly industrial aura of acetone had enveloped the Schiaparelli " Shocking " with which her body was impregnated . She started to work and as she bent forward two strands of auburn hair broke loose from their curly pattern and fell across her forehead . Under frowning brows the large blue eyes intently stared . To aid concentration , the tip of a pink tongue was held between the teeth . " Hell ! " she suddenly said aloud as the little brush made a false stroke . Then immediately the teeth clamped down again . Interrupting her work to allow the first coat of varnish to dry , she shifted her scrutiny from the toes to the calf and shin of her left leg . The hairs were beginning to grow again , she noticed with annoyance ; it would soon be time for another of those wax treatments . Still pensively caressing the leg , she let her mind travel back over the events of the day . The memory of that close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement . Then she thought of Sig with his stethoscope , and the upper lip lifted ravishingly in a smile of amusement . And then there was that book , which it served Uncle Jo right that she should have had Sig read to her . And Sig getting fresh with her between the chapters and making passes ; that also served Uncle Jo right for trying to spy on her . Site remembered how mad she got at Sig . Not so much for what he actually did ; for besides serving Uncle Jo right ( of course it was only afterward that she discovered quite how right it served him ) , what he actually did had been rather thrilling than otherwise ; because after all Sig was terribly attractive and in those ways Uncle Jo did n't hardly count ; in fact you might almost say that he counted the other way ; in the red , so to speak ; counted less than nobody , so that anybody else who was attractive seemed still more attractive when Uncle Jo had been around . No , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . It was the way he did it . Laughing at her , like that . She did n't mind a bit of kidding at ordinary times . But kidding while he was actually making passes  --  that was treating her like she was a tart on Main Street . No romance or anything ; just that sniggering sort of laugh and a lot of dirty cracks . Maybe it was sophisticated ; but she did n't like it . And did n't he see that it was just plain dumb to act that way ? Because , after all , when you 'd been reading that book with someone so attractive as Sig  --  well , you felt you 'd like a bit of romance . Real romance like in the pictures , with moonlight , and swing music , or perhaps a torch singer ( because it was nice to feel sad when you were happy ) , and a boy saying lovely things to you , and a lot of kissing , and at the end of it , almost without your knowing it , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you never felt there was anything wrong . . . Virginia sighed deeply and shut her eyes ; her face took on an expression of seraphic tranquillity . Then she sighed again , shook her head and frowned . Instead of that , she was thinking angrily , instead of that , Sig had to go and spoil it all by acting hard-boiled and sophisticated . It just shot all the romance to pieces and madc you feel mad at him . And what was the sense in that ? Virginia concluded resentfully . What was the sense in that , either from his point of view or from hers ? The first coat of varnish seemed to be dry . Bending over her foot , she blew on her toes for a little , then started to apply the second coat . Behind her , all of a sudden , the door of the bedroom was opened and as gently closed again . " Uncle Jo , " she said inquiringly and with a note of surprise in her voice , but without looking up from her enamelling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach across the room . " Uncle Jo ? " she repeated and , this time , interrupted the painting of her toes to turn round . Dr. Obispo was standing over her . " Sig ! " Her voice dropped to a whisper . " What are you doing ? " Dr. Obispo smiled his smile of ironic admiration , of intense and at the same time amused and mocking concupiscence . " I thought we might go on with our French lesson , " he said . " You 're crazy ! " She looked apprehensively towards the door . " He 's just across the hall . He might come in . . . " Dr. Obispo 's smile broadened to a grin . " Do n't worry about Uncle Jo , " he said . " He 'd kill you , if he found you here . " " He wo n't find me here , " Dr. Obispo answered . " I gave him a capsule of Nembutal before he went to bed . He 'll sleep through the Last Trump . " " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could n't help laughing , partly out of relief and partly because it really was rather funny to think of Uncle Jo snoring away next door while Sig read her that stuff . Dr. Obispo pulled the Book of Common Prayer out of his pocket . " Do n't let me interrupt your labors , " he said with the parody of chivalrous politeness . " ' A woman 's work is never done . ' Just go right on as though I were n't here . I 'll find the place and start reading . " Smiling at her with imperturbable impudence , he sat down on the edge of the rococo bed and turned over the pages of the book . Virginia opened her mouth to speak ; then , catching hold of her left foot , closed it again under the compulsion of a need even more urgent than that of telling him exactly where he got off . The varnish was drying in lumps ; her toes would look just awful if she did n't go on with them . Hastily dipping her little brush in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a focussed intensity . Dr. Obispo looked up from the book . " I admired the way you acted with Pete this evening , " he said . " Flirting with him all through dinner , so that you got the old man hopping jealous of him . That was masterly . Or should one say mistressly ? " Virginia released her tongue to say emphatically : " Pete 's a nice boy . " " But dumb , " Dr. Obispo qualified , as he sprawled with conscious elegance and a maddeningly insolent assumption of being at home , across the bed . " Otherwise he would n't be in love with you the way he is . " He uttered a snort of laughter . " The poor chump thinks you 're an angel , complete with wings , harp , and genuine eighteen-carat , fully jewelled , Swiss-made virginity . Well , if that is n't being dumb . . . " " You just wait till I get time for you , " said Virginia menacingly , but without looking up ; for she had reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art . Dr. Obispo ignored the remark . " I used to underestimate the value of an education in the humanities , " he said after a little silence . " Now I make that mistake no longer . " In a tone of deep solemnity , a tone , one might imagine , like Whittier 's in a reading from his own works , " The lessons of great literature ! " he went on . " The deep truths ! The gems of wisdom ! " " Oh , shut up ! " said Virginia . " When I think what I owe Dante and Goethe , " said Dr. Obispo in the same prophetic style . " Take the case of Paolo reading aloud to Francesca . With the most fruitful results , if you remember . Un giorno leggevamo per dileito di Lancilotto , come amor lo strinse . Soli eraramo e senz'alcun sospetto . Senz'alcun sospetto , ' " Dr. Obispo repeated with emphasis , looking , as he did so , at one of the engravings in the Cent-Vingt lours . " Not the smallest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hell ! " said Virginia , who had made another slip . " No , not even a suspicion of hell , " Dr. Obispo insisted . " Though of course they ought to have been on the lookout for it . They ought to have had the elementary prudence to guard against being sent there by the accident of sudden death . A few simple precautions , and they could have made the best of both worlds . Could have had their fun while the brother was out of the way and , whenthe time for having fun was over , could have repented and died in the odor of sanctity . They had n't learned that inconvenient relatives could be given sleeping draughts . And even if they had learned , they would n't have been able to go to the drugstore and buy a bottle of Nembutal . Which shows that education in the humanities is n't enough ; there must also be education in science . Dante and Gocthc to teach you what to do , and the professor of pharmacology to show you how to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barbiturate . " The toes were finished . Still holding her left foot , so as to keep it from any damaging contact until the varnish should be entirely dry , Virginia turned on her visitor . " I wo n't have you calling him an old buzzard , " she said hotly . " He 's a better man than you 'll ever be ! " Her voice had the ring of sincerity . " I think he 's wonderful . " " You think he 's wonderful , " Dr. Obispo repeated . He laughed as he spoke and , leaning forward from his place on the bed , caught her two arms from behind , a little below the shoulders . " Look out for your toes , " he said , as Virginia cried out and tried to wrench herself away from him . The fear of ruining her masterpiece made her check the movement before it was more than barely initiated . Dr. Obispo took advantage of her hesitation to stoop down , through the aura of acetone toward the nape of that delicious neck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the mouth , a touch of hair like silk upon the cheeks . Swearing , Virginia furiously jerked her head away . But a fine tingling of agreeable sensation was running parallel , so to speak , with her indignation , was incorporating itself in it . This time , Dr. Obispo kissed her behind the ear . " Shall I tell you , " he whispered , " what I 'm going to do to you ? " She answered by calling him a lousy ape-man .
