" The modern American Church school is the funniest thing in the land-or it would be if it were not the saddest . . . it is a tragic fiasco . " Thus the late Bishop Fiske ( Episcopalian ) of Central New York once wrote to The Rev. Kenneth R. Forbes . <P> Last week the Rev. Mr. Forbes , onetime chaplain of Philadelphia 's City Mission , used the Bishop 's words as ammunition in taking a few pot shots at those " pundits in religious education " who for 25 years " like an old phonograph record " have been expressing " great concern " over the " shocking ignorance " of Christian youth - and doing nothing about it . Chaplain Forbes had recommendations . <P> Said Forbes , " The parish clergy . , . have got to assume the duty of teaching children . . . and cease delegating it to others . "
