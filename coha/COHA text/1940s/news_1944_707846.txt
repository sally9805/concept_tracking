txt A policy shaped to maintain a high and stable level of employment in Britain after the war was published today by the Government in the form of yet another wartime White Paper on the post-war needs of the nation . In some respects it is by far the most important of the lot , since every aspect of rehabilitation needs money , and that must be earned . This is no ordinary report , for unlike the rest of its kind , it proposes no legislation but rather outlines the principles to be followed by the authorities and the private individual in the coming years . True , there may be a number of Acts of Parliament fathered by today 's paper , though the imr.:1-ision is that most of it could be translated into action ? dy administrative changes in public and private business . More than two and a half years of work went into the report . When the time came to publish its findings the credit for assembling them has gone to Lord Woolton , making this , incidentally , his first personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs developed earlier by this Government were turned over , naturally enough , to the Ministries concerned . Ernest Bevin , Minister of Labor , and Treasury officials had a big hand in the preparation of the employment White Paper . This afternoon both . Mr. Bevin and Lord Woolton tried to make clear its provisions to a gathering of newspaper men from many parts of the world interested in the effort being made here to solve the riddles of post-war life . Maintenance of employment , rather than a cure for unemployment , is the keynote of the paper . " It is a practical expression of expansionist policy  --  and I mean world-wide expansion of trade , " said Lord Woolton . Before any employment policy could be dreamed of it was necessary to find out whether the British people had the energy and ability to do the jobs required , Lord Woolton maintained . There had been talk in the course of the past twenty years to the effect that this nation was old , worn out and listless , but , he said , the industrial history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is beyond question today , " he said , " that productive power per worker is high . " With that much established to its satisfaction , the Government ' proposes to " pump money into the channels of consumption " by a wide variety of means , including planned spending on public works when depression threatens , concerted action between the Treasury , and the banks to influence the ' volume of capital expenditure by ' variations in the rate of interest so , as to keep money cheap , and a system of contributions under social insurance designed to maintain I the purchasing power of the community . Another danger will come when the public relaxes from the discipline and strain of war and looks for opportunities to spend cash . This , it was said , can lead to a shortage of goods , rising prices , inflation and , finally , to a grave economic disturbance . The answer will be the continuance of wartime restrictions , including strict control of the manufacture of nonessential products . A flourishing export trade is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while pointing out that steps to stimulate it will not be allowed to interfere with the war effort in the Far East . The guiding points in the employment policy . as listed in the White Paper . are four in number as follows : " 1 . To avoid an unfavorable for- , eign balance we must export much more than we did before the war . " 2 . Everything possible must be done to limit dangerous swings in expenditure on private investment ? though success in this field may be particularly hard to acheive. " 3 . Public investment , both in timing and volume , must be carefully planned to offset unavoidable fluctuations in private investment . " 4 . We must be ready to check and reverse a decline in expenditure on consumer goods which normally follows as a secondary reaction to a falling off in private investment . " Variation of taxation , wage rates closely related to productivity and a small , permanent economic advisory staff are other important wheels in the new scheme .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
