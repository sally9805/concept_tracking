Visitors to Mexico City 's National Bellas Artes gallery last week saw a mountain of modern Mexican painting . Except for the work of one artist , the mountain was close to being an extinct volcano . But inextinguishable firebrand David Alfaro Siqueiros had summoned up enough live steam and hot lava to make plenty of activity . <P> The show was sponsored by Mexico 's culture-conscious President Manuel Avila Camacho , who last year decreed an annual national prize for arts and sciences . ( 1945 's prize went to an author , rotund little Dr. Alfonso Reyes , for his Criticism in the Athenian Age . ) This year 's 20,000 pesos ( $4,140 ) will be awarded to an artist , plus 5,000 pesos each for the best example of painting , engraving , sculpture and architecture on exhibition . <P> Avila Camacho had thrown the gates wide : Bellas Artes ' marble and stained glass magnificence bulged with some 500 entries ; more than 400 of them were paintings . Long halls were devoted to unknowns from all parts of Mexico . Their work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sunday painters to imitations of imitations of the slick stuff produced in Mexico City . <P> Wizened Old Master Orozco contributed a twisted mass of bayonets and struggling bodies entitled The Trench , which looked like a great many he had done before . ( His best-known Trench was painted in 1923 . ) Fat , fast-talking Old Master Diego Rivera , who can always be counted on for a surprise , was surprisingly absent . He had been appointed a juror , and resigned at the last minute because " too little attention is given to architecture . I believe architecture is the most important of all the plastic arts . And second , I think too much prominence is given to the older artists . . . . " <P> Message in Oils . Older Artist ( 47 ) Siqueiros ' paintings would have seemed " prominent " wherever they hung . Their blood-rich colors , cast-iron forms and gravel textures made them stand out as far as the smearing fist in his Self Portrait ( see cut ) . Siqueiros ' second entry was relatively calm-a green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not quite so innocuous as it looked . In Spanish , calabazas ( gourds ) is a vulgar insult when spoken without a smile . Explained Siqueiros : the three calabazas stand for the three Government schools in charge of the competition . <P> Also included were most of Mexico 's many half-knowns : Goitia , Castellanos Tamayo , Meza , Montenegro , Cantu Galvn , Charlot , Mrida , and the surrealist Frida Kahlo ( Rivera 's third wife ) . By &; large they seemed suspiciously un-Mexican and disappointingly dull . Why did n't the " younger generation " of artists compare with Mexico 's aging masters ?
