In Montana , three out of ten country schools failed to open on S-day . Oregon and other states were offering pay increases up to 50% , rushing through emergency teaching certificates . In Sioux County , Iowa , School Superintendent Charles H. Tye thought up an original solution for the teacher shortage . Announced he : <P> " If any teachers find it hard to get dates or land a man , and they have what it takes-personality and brains-just come to Sioux County and I will get them a good job and a man within a year if they are in that big a hurry . We need both teachers and wives up here . We have the jobs and we have the men . "
