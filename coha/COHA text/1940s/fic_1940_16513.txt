In contrast to the section of street in the preceding scene , this block is almost deserted and fairly dark . An occasional motor car ; few pedestrians . In front of a house , Number 39 to be exact - a man stands , leaning against the iron fence . He wears an overcoat which is unbuttoned , and an unusually long scarf around his neck . He stands idle , almost motionless , watching Michael approach without much interest . Michael , his eyes on the pavement , does not see the man . Michael lives in Number 39 . As he approaches the house his hand mechanically goes into his pocket for the key . The man begins to show interest in Michael . He leans forward and turns so that he faces Michael , who at this moment , reaches the house . He looks up ; sees the man , stops . 60 CLOSE SHOT Michael , startled by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; MICHAEL 'S VOICEFunny looking customer  --   --  35  --  61 CLOSE SHOT the Man .

CLOSE SHOT Michael and the Man . With only the width of the stairway leading up to the front door between them , they stand for a moment , facing each other . The man is still grinning . There is something in his grin that makes Michael shudder . He quickly turns now and starts up the stairway . The Man 's eyes follow him . The grin disappears from his face ; he becomes tense and determined . A moment later , trying to look casual , he starts after Michael up the stairway .

Next to the desk a small typewriter-table with the machine on it . It is early spring , but the window is closed . The low , rhythmic sound of Meng 's snoring continues .

His face is warm and his expression one of desperate melancholy . He looks around the room with distaste until his eye lights on a picture of Jane on his desk . He smiles and walks over to it . &nbsp; MICHAEL WARD ( cont 'd ) ( picking up picture ) Poor kid ...
