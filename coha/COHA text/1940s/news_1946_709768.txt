txt Mayor O'Dwyer , Edward J. Flynn , Democratic leader of the Bronx , and a rebel group in Tammany Hall are scheduled to carry out on Friday a coup that may have the effect of a revolution in local politics . Their plan , it was learners authoritatively yesterday , is to strip the present leadership of Tammany Hall  --  the triumvirate of Edward V. Loughlin , Clarence Neal and Bert Stand ? of the Hall 's last remaining source of patronage and perquisites , the naming of Supreme Court Justices . At the Democratic convention of the First Judicial District , to be held Friday at the Central Commercial High School on East Forty-second Street , Mr. Flynn 's eighty delegates from the Bronx and a group of possibly thirty from Manhattan , rounded up with the active assistance of Mayor O'Dwyer , are scheduled to ally themselves , leaving the Tammany leadership without convention control . There are 100 Manhattan delegates . Contest on Z Seats Planned Four Supreme Court Justices are to be nominated . Two of them , Aron Steuer and Samuel H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basis of their records of the past fourteen years . The other vacancies are those caused by the retirement , at the age of 70 , of Alfred H. Townley and by the nomination of William T. Collins by all parties for a full term as Surrogate . Justice Townley and Surrogate Collins are Manhattan men and under time-honored tradition the Flynn Bronx organization would offer no candidates , leaving their selection to the Manhattan leadership . However , two years ago and again a year ago Mr. Flynn urged the nomination of Samuel J. Foley , Bronx District Attorney , for what le contended was a Bronx vacancy , ind was ignored by the Manhattan Leadership , then in full control . With this in mind and anxious either to break or weaken the presant Tammany leadership , the Mayor took the lead in arranging the coalition that was in effect last night . Under it Mr. Flynn would get one of the vacancies for a Bronx man , and the Tammany rebels and the Mayor , who has been recognizing them in other patronage matters , would select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Thomas L. J. Corcoran , Deputy Mayor , who would be acceptable to the minority in Tammany . Mr. Corcoran was counsel to the Governor in the Herbert H. Lehman administration . Prior to his selection as Deputy Mayor he was chairman of the Tammany Hall Law Committee and a close associate of Mr. Loughlin . The Mayor 's break with . Mr. Loughlin has somewhat strained the relationship between Mr. Corcoran and the leader of Tammany , it is believed , but his selection would be difficult for the Tammany leadership to attack . Foley 's Chances Held Dubious Mr. Flynn is believed to be less anxious to advance Mr. Foley 's candidacy now than he was last year . The Bronx tradition calls for the eventual promotion of a successful District Attorney to the Supreme Court , but Mr. Foley was re-elected last year , and if he resigned now or after election the vacancy would be filled by appointment of the Governor . The Democratic leadership , pointing to the situation caused when Mayor O'Dwyer resigned as District Attorney of Kings County last year after his nomination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office for the gathering of material that might be used in a campaign . As a result of this , Mr. Foley is believed out as a possibility now and Mr. Flynn 's choice for the place is not known . Tammany will have the advantage of controlling the machinery of the convention , in that its temporary chairman will be Jacob Markowitz , chairman of the Tammany Law Committee . However , Tammany appears to be relying more on the reluctance of politicians to break a tradition . In other words , if the Flynn organization , in a deal with insurgents , takes a nomination to which it is not technically entitled this year , there would be nothing to protect the Flynn organization against Tammany domination in years to come , with the tradition broken . However , Mayor O'Dwyer , who has been giving New York County patronage to a group headed by Frank J. Sampson and John L. Buckley , was represented yesterday as set to go through with the move .               @ @ @ @ @ @
