Thank Your Lucky Stars ( Warner ) , the most crowded constellation Warner Bros , has ever assembled , surrounds Eddie Cantor with such newcomers to song &; dance as Bette Davis , Humphrey Bogart , John Garfield , Ida Lupino , Ann Sheridan , Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland . Dinah Shore , Joan Leslie , Dennis Morgan and Alexis Smith , who know their way around in this sort of work , help out . Veteran comics S. Z. Sakall and Edward Everett Horton help still more . But the picture is most amusing as a sort of glorified Amateur Night . <P> The story requires Mr. Cantor to portray himself as a Pandora 's box of stale jokes , an egomaniac with whom Messrs . Horton &; Sakall traffic only because he owns Dinah Shore , who is essential to a Monster Benefit they want to stage . Their problem : to pull for the Shore without shipping too much Cantor . They fail , and Mr. Cantor , taking charge , develops such old-fashioned ideas for the show as that of dressing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tank of sour cream . <P> Mr. Cantor also plays a Hollywood guide whose lifelong tragedy , cheating him of a screen career , is his resemblance to Eddie Cantor . This damaged soul lives among others of Hollywood 's lumpenproletariat in Gower Gulch , a sort of surrealist Hooverville . Eventually the true Cantor is kidnapped by Gower Gulch Indians who adopt him into the tribe for the benefit of a LIFE photographer ( flatteringly misrepresented by Joan Leslie ) . At the climax of the Monster Benefit the false Cantor impersonates the man he hates most in the world , the true Cantor . Meanwhile the true Cantor suffers as he has suffered for years : Indians tie him up , tomahawk him ; maple syrup falls on his bare feet , dogs of all sizes lick it off ; a covey of surgeons , to whom he tries to explain his predicament , go to work on him under the impression that he is insane . <P> This grim study is most notably relieved by : <P> &gt;Dinah Shore , singing Thank Your Lucky Stars , The Dreamer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose bubbling , blaring good humor more than redeems the roaring bad taste of a Harlem number called Ice Cold Katie . &gt; Ann Sheridan , as an experienced college girl , explaining in song , to a bevy of hastily dry-cleaned doves , " why every window has a window shade " and why " there 's no partition in a davenport . " <P> &gt; Errol Flynn , singing and swaggering a neat Cockney period act , That 's What You Jolly Well Get . <P> &gt; Olivia de Havilland , Ida Lupino and George Tobias ( pinch-hitting for Humphrey Bogart , who was scared to involve himself in so unrefined an act ) yowling and prancing through a frenzied , nightmarish parody of The Dreamer and the whole hierarchy of " dream " songs .
