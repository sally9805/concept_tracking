 | The Roosevelt Legend Condensed from Life Hamilton Basso WHEN the historian of the future gets around to evaluating the character and influence of Franklin Delano Roosevelt , one of his conclusions certainly will be that within three years of his death a legend of glory had already begun to form about him . Already a steady stream of books and magazine articles about him has appeared . Frances Perkins , whose book The Roosevelt I Knew is by all odds the best , first met the future President when he was 28 years old and had just been elected to the New York state legislature . He seemed to her an ordinary , respectable young man with an artificially serious expression and little if any concern about social reform . He had the habit of throwing his head up and thrusting out his chin , which , in combination with his pince-nez and great height , gave him the unfortunate appearance of looking down his nose . Miss Perkins remembers an old-line Tammany politician , Tim Sullivan , saying to her , " Awful arrogant fellow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Roosevelt arguing one , the senate floor , his mouth pursed , his nostrils distended , saying , " No , no , I wo n't hear of it ! " Miss Perkins had gone to Albany to fight for a bill to establish a 54-hour week for women in industry in New York . She hoped Roosevelt would get behind the bill , but he did nothing to help . She took his indifference hard at the time , but she now feels that his early lack of interest in social reform can be traced to " a youthful lack of humility , a streak of self-righteousness , and a deafness to the hopes , fears and aspirations which are the common lot . " Roosevelt had moved in a very narrow range . His father was one of the leading members of the Hudson River gentry a self-contained , comfortable moneyed class . Young Roosevelt 's playmates were the children of families in similar circumstances . Instead of being sent to  | school he was turned over to tutors . He was taken abroad several times , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , New Brunswick . It was not until he was 14 , when he entered Groton , that he began to mingle with groups of boys his own age . Roosevelt went to Groton , as Alden Hatch has said , with a mind " like a jackdaw 's nest , full of shiny bits of unrelated knowledge . " But , says Mr. Hatch , touching on a point that Roosevelt 's enemies often aimed at , " in all Franklin 's miscellaneous collection of knowledge there was one significant blank : that was in relation to money . " His sense of financial security was so strong that he never thought about it at all . At Groton , Roosevelt was more interested in sports than in books , and went out for baseball , football , track and crew . His special love , and one that he never lost , was for boats . Even as President , Miss Perkins observes , Roosevelt was capable of almost childish vanity about his seamanship . Roosevelt wanted to go to Annapolis , but his father persuaded him to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , joined all the right clubs and became editor of the Harvard Crimson . Graduating in 1904 , he went to Columbia Law School . But here also , as at Groton and Harvard , Roosevelt was an indifferent student , and he did not graduate . He was admitted to the bar in 1907 by examination , but did not like practicing law any more than he had like studying it . So it would seem that Franklin D ? Roosevelt went into politics largely ' 1 because he did not know what else to do . In 1910 he was elected to the New York state senate , and in 1912 , at the Democratic national convention , worked hard for Woodrow Wilson 's nomination . While moved by the social and ethical content of Wilson 's program , he was more moved by being offered the post of Assistant Secretary of the Navy . " " I 'd rather have that place than any other in public life , " he said . One of his jobs was to listen to the grievances of state committeemen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average political imagination . " A little patronage , a lot of pleasure , and public signs of friendship and prestige , " he told Frances Perkins , years later ? that 's what makes a political leader secure with his people . " Roosevelt 's attack of infantile paralysis in 1921 was , in the opinion of nearly everyone who has written about him , the real educative process of his life . " The man emerged completely warmhearted , with humility of spirit and with a deeper philosophy , " writes Miss Perkins . " His viability ? his power to grow in re- i sponse to experience ? was beginning to show . " Roosevelt 's health , Vice-Admiral : Ii McIntire records in White House Physician , was whispered about as early as 1932 . These rumors were silenced by Roosevelt 's obvious and  | apparently inexhaustible vitality , ' It in 1944 , after the passage of 12 ears were reflected in thin hair , lost weight and a furrowed face , they rvived . Roosevelt did not intend camnaigning in 1944 , but after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a rather good ampaign , he changed his mind . He also wanted to combat the whisperings about his health . " There has been this constant rumor that I 'll of live if I am re-elected , " he anaounced one day at a Cabinet meet " Apparently Papa has to tell them . ' " He came back to Washington , having gained 12 pounds . " What 'd you expect ? " he asked . ' These campaign trips get a little tougher , but I thrive on ' em ! " It would appear that Roosevelt had a genuine affection for Winston Churchill . " It was a feeling , " James Byrnes writes in his Speaking Frankly , that was cordially reciprocated . It was the kind of friendship that permitted frankness in their conversat ions with each other and about each other . " Roosevelt felt confident that he would be able to get along with Stalin , too . But at Teheran he found t hat the Marshal was not going to be , is easy as he had expected . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed at his embassy , " one to his dinners , met his generals and admirals ? but Stalin remained correct , stiff and solemn . Roosevelt began to think he had made the long trip for nothing . " I had to cut through this icy surface , " he explained . On the way to the conference room one morning he drew Churchill aside . " Winston , " he said , " I hope you wo n't be sore at me for what I am going to do . " Churchill shifted his cigar and grunted . A few minutes later in the conference room Roosevelt said , in a loud stage whisper , " Winston is cranky this morning . He got up on the wrong side of the bed . " A vague smile passed over Stalin 's face . Roosevelt pressed his advantage . He began to tease Churchill about his Britishness , about John Bull , about his cigars . Churchill reddened and scowled . The more he did so , the more Stalin smiled . " Finally , " Roosevelt told Miss Perkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guffaw . It was then that I called him Uncle Joe . ' From that time on our relations were personal . " That Stalin was finally won over by Roosevelt is not particularly surprising : most people were . Roosevelt 's personal habits , we learn from Miss Perkins , were simple to the point of bareness . As President he slept on a narrow , white iron bed with a thin , hard-looking mattress , a couple of pillows and an old gray shawl for a blanket . " Do n't like those heavy things , " he once explained . He wore a sweater to bed to keep his shoulders warm when he had a cold . A small wooden table , painted white , stood near the bed . On it were aspirin , nose drops , a glass of water , bits of paper with  | telephone numbers , a few books , a watch , an old prayer book , a package of cigarettes , an ash tray and a couple of telephones . In addition , the room contained a heavy dark wardrobe ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old-fashioned rocker and an old bureau . Over one door hung a horse 's tail . It used to belong to an animal named Gloucester , which had been raised by Roosevelt 's father . Gloucester was regarded by all the Roosevelts as a piece of horseflesh only slightly inferior to Man o ' War . Roosevelt was a moderate drinker and a disinterested eater . Whenever he was in a gathering that called for prolonged drinking , he always asked for a " horse 's neck " : ginger ale , lemon peel and no alcohol . Up to the day he died he was a chain smoker . Roosevelt 's taste for salt spray greatly influenced his other tastes , especially in painting . As Frances Perkins points out , Roosevelt did not appreciate paintings : " The only pictures he really cared about were pictures of ships , " she writes . " And he judged these by the correctness with which the rigging was painted . " Painters were sometimes troubled by this crow's-nest view of art . George Biddle is quoted as saying , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet he has done more for painters in this country than anybody ever did ? not only by feeding them when they were down and out but by establishing the idea that artists are important . " But Roosevelt had no such motive . " Why not ? " he said when the idea of putting artists on the Government payroll was presented , " They are human beings . They have to live . I guess the only thing they can do is paint and surely there must be some public place where painting are wanted . " Roosevelt seems to have had a genuine religious feeling . He did not go to church as frequently as some people thought he should , but he read the Bible and the Book of Common Prayer a good deal , and knew many passages by heart . He went to church more often when he wal away from Washington . " I can do almost everything in the goldfish bowl ' of the President 's life , " he once told Miss Perkins , " but I 'll be hanged if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be looked at by all the tourists in Washington when I go to church . " Miss Perkins tells a story about a young reporter who once asked Roosevelt , in her presence , what his philosophy was . Roosevelt looked , puzzled . " Philosophy ? " he repeated : " I am a Christian and a Democrat ? that 's all . " " Those two words expressed , I think , the extent of his political and economic radicalism , " writes Miss Perkins . " He was willing to do experimentally whatever was necessary to promote the Golden Rule and other ideals he considered to be Christian , and whatever could be done under the Constitution of the United States and under the princi-  | ples which have guided the Demo- cratic Party . " Others , naturally , will disagree ; and the future historian will have to take this disagreement into consideration , for it is too widespread to be ignored . His job , once he has drawn a portrait of Roosevelt , will be to find his way around a tangle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dream , or did it represent a peaceful , necessary economic revolution ? Was Roosevelt so intoxicated with the pomp and privilege of power that he could not bear to delegate authority , or was he so absorbed in all the affairs of government that he simply had to have his finger in every pie ? Was his political program composed only of leanings , sentiments and emotions , or did he have a definite end in mind ? Was that end the firming-up of the traditional capitalist system , or did it seek to transform the United States into a socialist state ? All these questions must be answered . But as far as the popular image of Roosevelt is concerned , most of this labor will go for nothing . For the truth of history is rarely considered by the masses . The Roosevelt legend began when his life ended , and already we can see in the recently released motion picture , The Roosevelt Story , the shape the legend is likely to take . First of all he will be a simple man instead of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origins ( Hyde Park might just as well be a log cabin ) . Then , from earliest boyhood , he will be moved by a passion for social justice ( instead of coming to an understanding of human problems when he was nearing middle age ) . His natural wit will serve him in good stead , as when he routed the Republicans with his " Fala speech , " and the fact that he was not an intellectual giant will not be held against him ( brilliantly clever men never become popular heroes in this country ) . But over and above all else , like Jefferson , Jackson , Lincoln and all the other source-springs of our national inspiration , he will be a man of the people . And this , as far as the people themselves are concerned , he was . They believe he was one of them and that he was for them . The Roosevelt legend rests solely on this . Its strength lies in its simplicity , and because of its simplicity it seems likely to endure .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
