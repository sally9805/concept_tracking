" Singing , " says Artist Georgia O'Keeffe , " has always seemed to me the most perfect means of expression . Since I can not sing , I paint . " Last week 57 examples of her kind of song went on view in Manhattan 's Museum of Modern Art . Each one had the contrived spontaneity of music , and in each the melody of line and color meant more than the bones , blossoms , skyscrapers , barns , crosses and canyon walls she used for lyrics . <P> Whatever else can be said about her , no one paints a pelvis or a skull more cleanly or searchingly than O'Keeffe . Her brush , like a surgical knife , pares the bony involutions to paper thinness , sculpturing them in icy white against the ice-blue sky of New Mexico-where she spends half of each year . <P> To flower painting she brings a technique familiar in photography but seldom attempted on canvas : the dramatic closeup . Like a bee , she explores the innermost recesses of hollyhocks , irises and morning-glories , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream-smooth satisfaction from them . <P> Canyons , in City and Country . But O'Keeffe 's chief claim to fame lies in the brilliant hardness of her most ambitious work . Her cityscapes look as unyielding as asphalt , and sharp as broken glass ; her barns are as antiseptic as hospitals ; her crosses as forbidding as the real thing . <P> O'Keeffe 's art , says Museum director of painting and sculpture James Johnson Sweeney , in a forthcoming Museum book on O'Keeffe , is " stark but always constrained . . . . And the way she came to this was by the severest self-stripping . " O'Keeffe , a thin , austere-looking woman , has been stripping herself for a long time . Born 58 years ago in the small town of Sun Prairie , Wis. , she decided to paint as she pleased , because " it seemed to be the only thing that I could do that did not concern anyone but myself . . . . " <P> After studying in Manhattan , doing commercial art in Chicago , and teaching in Texas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private exhibition of everything I had painted . I noticed which paintings had been influenced by this painter , which by that one . Then I determined which . . . represented me alone . From that moment forward I knew exactly what kind of work I wanted to do . " <P> In 1916 a friend showed O'Keeffe 's drawings ( without her permission ) to Alfred Stieglitz , pioneer photographer and missionary of modern art . Said he : " Finally-a woman on paper . " When he put her work on exhibition , O'Keeffe stormed into Stieglitz ' gallery to protest , afraid that gallerygoers would find the drawings incomprehensible . Stieglitz asked gently whether she herself knew what her drawings meant . Huffed O'Keeffe : " Do you think I 'm an idiot ? " Eight years later they were married .
