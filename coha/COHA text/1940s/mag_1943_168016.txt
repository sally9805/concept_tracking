To most U.S. citizens nothing could be more British than the toploftical Encyclopaedia Britannica . Yet for more than 20 years the Britannica has been controlled by the world 's biggest mail-order house , Chicago 's Sears , Roebuck &; Co . <P> Last week University of Chicago President Robert Maynard Hutchins announced that Sears had given the Britannica to his university . The transfer itself was logical enough : members of Chicago 's philanthropic Rosenwald family , identified with Sears , Roebuck for half a century , have long been generous supporters of the university . Onetime Chairman Julius Rosenwald was responsible for Sears 's acquisition of the Britannica in 1920 , when it was in such bad financial straits that its priceless plates were about to be sold at auction . What made the deal especially interesting was what Bob Hutchins did not tell about it . <P> Sears ' gift to the university was engineered by U.C. 's kinetic Vice President William Benton . Bill Benton is famed in the advertising world as the onetime chairman of Benton &; Bowles and the man who said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came by his yearning for learning naturally : both his father and his mother were university professors . He sees the Britannica as a logical adjunct to U.C. , which has always had a flair for combining scholarship with good publicity . <P> But , since the gift did not include the Britannica 's ( i.e. , Sears 's ) working capital , rich U.C. 's trustees thought they might be getting a pig in a poke . They did not want to risk endowment funds on a property that had long had more cachet than cash ( though its domestic sales last year were over $4,000,000 , Sears prudently carried the Britannica on its books at $1 ) . Result : Bill Benton himself agreed to put up whatever might be needed to keep it going , took an unnamed percentage of the stock from U.C. to back his investment . The university has an option to buy his stock ( for the sum he put into it-plus no interest ) if the going is good , a further option on the whole works at 42-year-old Bill Benton 's death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ample talents to making the university 's gift pay . <P> The Britannica ( whose name was chosen merely to indicate that it was written in English ) was first issued in 1768 in Edinburgh by " a society of gentlemen in Scotland . " Its first editor was a tippling friend of Robert Burns named William Smellie . Financial control passed to U.S. citizens about 1901.
