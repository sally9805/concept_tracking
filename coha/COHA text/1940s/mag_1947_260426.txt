They might try to escape the boredom of debate and deadlock by fiddling with their pencils , twiddling their thumbs or staring at the floor and ceiling . But one fact the members of U.N . ' s Security Council could not escape last week : history was at their throats . The debate was on the U.S. formula for a two-year peace watch by the United Nations on the war-threatened borders of Greece . There , like the pebble that starts an avalanche , even a minor explosion might precipitate events that would involve the world in a third global war .

Last week the first step was taken . Greece , charging that there had been a breach of peace , invoked Chapter VII of the U.N . Charter . Under that chapter the Security Council can apply economic or military sanctions against Albania , Yugoslavia and Bulgaria if they continue to support armed aggression against Greece . If the international brigade moves into Greece , and Russia vetoes action under Chapter VII , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 51 ( " Nothing . . . shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a member of the United Nations . . . .
