A minor upheaval in the Foreign Service-the result of George Marshall 's determination to weed out the aged , the sick and the weary-sent half a dozen more State Department careerists careering off to new ambassadorial posts last week . The most noteworthy appointment was the Ambassador to the new embassy in the chrysaloid nation of India : 65-year-old Henry F. Grady of San Francisco , rotund president of the American President Lines . <P> Grady is no newcomer to Government service . A native San Franciscan , he started out as an educator and gravitated between lecture room and trade commissions . He helped write the reciprocal trade program and served as Assistant Secretary of State under Cordell Hull . <P> Grady was plucked from State to head the gigantic President Lines . Along San Francisco 's waterfront he managed to avoid the enmity of Harry Bridges-no mean job . In Nob Hill 's staid Pacific Union Club , he managed to get along with fellow members despite his known New Dealism and liberal views . <P> State borrowed him to serve on the Allied mission which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use for him again . <P> India is not new to him . He was there in 1942 on a technical mission to drum up India 's war production . Grady 's views , which poverty-stricken India would find worth studying : " With a population of 400 million people India can raise the standard of living of her people only through production , particularly industrial production . " Grady , called " Doctor " by some who remember his educator days , is earnestly certain that the greatest service U.S. industry can render world peace is to supply the technical knowledge which will help cure the world 's economic ills .
