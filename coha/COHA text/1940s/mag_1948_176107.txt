In London on Christmas morning , 1865 , tall , hirsute William Booth came down to breakfast with a straw-lined basket in his hands . " Here , " he said to his sons &; daughters , " is God 's Christmas gift . " <P> God 's gift to the Booths that Christmas was an auburn-haired girl who grew up to be a general-Evangeline Booth of the Salvation Army . Now 82 and retired , General Booth has never written her memoirs , though she has often been urged to . Said she : " I have never written about myself . I wo n't write about myself , and that decides it . " But she let somebody else do it : she handed her papers and correspondence over to British Journalist Philip Whitwell Wilson , with whom she had been in close touch for some 20 years . Published this week is Author Wilson 's General Evangeline Booth ( Scribner ; $3.50 ) -a warm and folksy paean of praise for a remarkable woman . <P> " I Die a Ransom ! " The Salvation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were both born in the same year . At 15 she was fitted out with a sergeant 's uniform and sallied forth as a full-fledged soldier of Christ . The Salvationists of those days lived in a world of bitter war . Mission houses were " citadels " and " forts , " converts were " prisoners of war " or " trophies . " Posters proclaimed : <P> WAR ! WAR IN WHITBY ! <P> 2,000 MEN AND WOMEN <P> Wanted at once to Join the Hallelujah <P> Army that is Making an Attack <P> on the Devil 's Kingdom . . . <P> Little Eva , * as she was called , dressed herself in rags and masqueraded as a Piccadilly Circus flower girl , or sold matches , to learn the needs and ways of the poor she was dedicated to help . To campaign against liquor , she bought a guitar and charmed boozers out of pubs with her singing . She began to preach in the vivid , staccato style that later packed the biggest auditoriums : <P> " Judgment thunders : the wages of sin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking through the ranks of heaven and hell there comes one with garments dyed crimson red . <P> " His brow drops blood , His side is torn , His hands have nail prints , His feet are bruised , His heart is bleeding , and He throws his emaciated body across the gaping chasm between justice and mercy , and cries : <P> " ' Stand back , ye lawful accusers , I die a ransom ! . . . ' <P> " Behold the Lamb of God who taketh away the sins of the world . " <P> In 1895 , when General William Booth was on a tour abroad , his eldest son , Chief of Staff Bramwell Booth , ordered a general shuffling of Commissioners . In what has been called a game of musical chairs , he recalled his younger brother , Commissioner Ballington Booth , from his post in the U.S. In protest Ballington and his wife resigned and began to set up a rival organization called Volunteers of America . Evangeline was rushed to New York to talk him out of it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New York Army members to try to convert them to his Volunteers , sister Evangeline found the doors closed against her . She dashed around to the rear of the building , climbed the fire escape and appeared dramatically on the platform . She spoke , writes Author Wilson , " as seldom she has spoken before or since . " The Salvationists ( but not brother Ballington ) were won over .
