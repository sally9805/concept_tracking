In the postwar hot-stove debates about who really won the war , a respectful hearing will have to be given to the claims of a mildly wacky group of scientific playboys-the amateur stargazers and telescope-makers . Without them , U.S. ordnance men would have been hard up for gun sights . These amateurs , who turned from telescopes to making essential roof prisms* for sights , have been considered so important in the war effort that they worked under aliases . Last week they finally gave their right names . <P> Amateur telescope-making is a cult with some 20,000 devoted addicts . With homemade equipment , they work at a hobby that requires a very high degree of workmanship-grinding telescope mirrors which must be accurate to two-millionths of an inch ( TIME , Aug. to , 1942 ) . The man who taught most of them the technique is a onetime Arctic explorer ( who sailed with Peary ) named Russell W. Porter . His amateur grinding has made him so expert that he is now a consultant on the polishing of Caltech 's famed 200-in . Mt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner , Editor Albert G.

Two years ago Stargazers Porter &; Ingalls marched into the Frankford Arsenal with an opportune proposal . The Army desperately needed workmen to make roof prisms for field and anti-aircraft guns and other military instruments . Porter &; Ingalls said that amateur telescope-makers , who had years of experience in just such exact work , were eager to take a crack at the job . <P> The Arsenal doubtfully doled out 2-4 pieces of precious optical glass , told the amateurs to go ahead and try . The amateurs failed to hit the mark at their first attempts . Porter , Ingalls &; Person thereupon lined up So top-notch amateurs , named them " The Gang , " sent them instructions , set up a system of postcard communication , soon began to deliver roof prisms by the thousand . <P> Glass Widows . Tooling up for roof-prism-making cost the amateurs from $100 to $200 apiece .

Their pay : expenses , a small profit , and an incentive to ride a hobby as hard as possible . Cried one fanatic : " To hell with the money ! " <P> Amateur telescope-makers are so notoriously single-track that their wives call themselves " glass widows . " One wife , out of pique , once locked her husband in his cellar workshop ; another sued for divorce and won . Editor Albert Ingalls last week proudly called off some of his pet names : D. T. Broadhead ( alias " Jim Fogarty " ) of Wellsville , N.Y. ; William Buchel ( alias " Robert Gray " ) of Toledo ; Paul Linde ( alias " Pavel Uvaroff " ) and Fred Person ( alias " Alex MacTavish " ) of Biloxi , Miss .
