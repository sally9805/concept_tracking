WHY have the Australian and American governments suddenly decided to exchange Ministers ? For years rumors have circulated about such an exchange , but as often as these were put in print the Australian government denied any such intent . The reason usually given was that the material interests of Australia in America hardly justified the expense of maintaining a Minister and staff in Washington . The American government however has long indicated that it was prepared to exchange Ministers at any time and , indeed , has exerted a good deal of quiet pressure to bring the exchange about . In recent years the American consular service in Australia has been extended ; unusually distinguished men have been appointed lately to the post of ConsulGeneral in Sydney ; and the desirability of getting diplomatic relations on a ministerial plane has persistently been indicated . The rumors about an exchange have usually originated in Washington . Why ? It is in relation to Pacific Ocean politics that Australian-American relations must be appraised . The American search for new angles of approach to Pacific politics is unremitting . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken toward them vary with circumstances . One persistent trouble has been the absence of reliable allies . Professor A. Whitney Griswold has indicated in The Far Eastern Policy of the United States that all efforts to co-operate with the United Kingdom government have ended in frustration for Washington . What is needed is support which will consistently complement the American policy . This kind of support may be found in Australia ; and what is true of Australia is also largely true of New Zealand . The fundamental Australian policies fit neatly into what Washington wants to do ; and where concrete evidence of agreement is lacking , it is more because Australian policy is not developed in that particular direction than that it is formulated in a hostile fashion . The business of exploring and co-ordinating policy is unquestionably  |p561  item number one on the agenda papers of Richard Gardiner Casey , who has come to Washington from Australia , and of Clarence Gauss , who has gone to Canberra to represent the United States . The Australian political approach to the United States must be along the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in getting Australia to appoint a Minister it will not have to use persuasion to get the Minister to talk Pacific policy . It is true that-most Australians are neither very alert nor very well informed about international affairs and have been content to be spoon-fed by the United Kingdom in the matter of foreign policy . The cry is " follow Britain . " But " follow Britain " is not to-day a policy ; it is rather a reflex action below the level of consciousness . The intelligent minority has had to fight this immature attitude ( only " appropriate to desert tribesmen , " as Professor Macmahon Ball has said ) , and while they have made but little progress in figuring out a comprehensive national policy , they have made important progress in establishing in the minds of strategic individuals the desirability of a national policy in Pacific affairs . This was shown last year when Robert Gordon Menzies became Prime Minister and said in his Policy Speech : In the Pacific we have primary responsibilities and primary risks . Close as our consultation with Great Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs , it is still true to say that we must , to a large extent , be guided by her knowledge and affected by her decisions . The problems of the Pacific are different . What Great Britain calls the Far East is to us the near north . Little given as I am to encouraging the exaggerated ideas of Dominion independence and separation which exist in some minds , I have become convinced that in the Pacific , Australia must regard herself as a principal providing herself with her own information and maintaining her own diplomatic contacts with foreign Powers . I do not mean by this that we are to act in the Pacific as if we were a completely separate Power ; we must , of course , act as an integral part of the British Empire . We must have full consultation and co-operation with Great Britain , South Africa , New Zealand , and Canada . But all those consultations must be on the basis that the primary risk in the Pacific is borne by New Zealand and ourselves . . This means increased diplomatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Japan , to say nothing of the Netherlands East Indies and the other countries which fringe the Pacific . It is true that we are not a numerous people , but we have vigor , intelligence , and resource , and I see no reason why we should not play not only an adult , but an effective , part in the affairs of the Pacific . Coming from a Prime Minister , this was a great step forward ; and that he should so quickly take action to translate his view from theory to practice is proof that the Australians are now actively looking for a national policy in the Pacific Basin . II The existing Pacific policies which Australia will bring to the council table are three . All have deep historical roots . In no sense are they mere paper constructions of the intellectuals . They are : to guarantee that the Pacific islands to the north and east of the continent are either under their direct control or in the hands of friendly powers ; to exclude from Australian territory all immigrants of Asiatic origin ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other Eastern countries . These policies plainly match well-established American policies . Naturally the Americans have developed them into more elaborate forms than is true of their Australian equivalents , and a point to watch is how far the Australians can be persuaded to accept the elaborations . Will they , for example , support the American concern for the " integrity " of China , the open door , the nonrecognition of conquests by force of arms , and so on ? It is likely that they will find reasons for so doing if the quid pro quo is attractive . The Australian aspiration to control the South Pacific islands is very old . When the British began to settle Australia in 1788 ( as a prison colony ) the commission of the first Governor covered not only the eastern mainland of what was then known as New Holland but  |p562  also " all the islands adjacent in the Pacifick Ocean " within the same degrees of south latitude . The commissions of the governors were soon confined to what were clearly coastal islands , but the aspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never really declined in Australia . Most of the South Pacific islands which are now under the British flag came under the crown as a result of discovery by British seamen ; but where there were rival claimants , as during the nineteenth century when any bit of territory without a master was a temptation to the European imperialists , the Australians always put pressure on the United Kingdom to assert jurisdiction . In succession the Australians opposed the incursions of France and Germany , and they succeeded in forcing radical changes of policy with regard to the islands that France succeeded in taking over . For example it was long-continued pressure from Australia through London which in 1898 persuaded the French to cease using New Caledonia as a penal colony . Important British possessions over which control was originally exerted in response to Australian pressure are Fiji , which passed under British control in 1875 , the New Hebrides , which have been held jointly with France since 1887 , and that part of New Guinea known as Papua , which came into British possession in 1888 . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Australians were in the hands of the British , which was entirely satisfactory ; the French , of whom they had lost their early suspicion ; the Dutch , of whom they had never had much suspicion ; the Portuguese ( in Timor ) , allies of Great  |p563  Britain ; and the Germans . In 1899 the Germans acquired control of the greater portion of the Samoan Islands , while a power new to the region took over the rest , including Pago Pago , the best harbor in the South Pacific islands . This was the United States . The First World War changed this picture . The Germans were expelled . At the behest of London and in response to their own desires , the Australians took over the German portion of New Guinea and the island of Nauru , while the New Zealanders took over the German portion of Samoa . This eliminated Germany south of the equator . The Australians expected to go on and take the German islands north of the line ; indeed , London had instructed them to that end ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Japanese would take care of these islands . At the Peace Conference it came out that in February , 1917 , the British had made a secret treaty with Japan , Prime Minister Hughes of Australia agreeing , which gave them to Japan . This was not very palatable to the Australian public , but nothing could be done . Hughes of Australia , Prime Minister Massey of New Zealand , and the Japanese all contended at Versailles for the right to annex these islands . President Wilson wanted them put under mandates . The clash of policy precipitated what Baker calls the " first great struggle of the Peace Conference . " In the end Wilson won a partial victory , for the territories became C-class mandates in the hands of those who had captured them . A C-class mandate is difficult to distinguish from absolute sovereignty , and when Japan left the League she kept her islands . If the First World War got Germany out of the South Pacific Islands it brought Japan uncomfortably close to Australia ; and this did not fail to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ islands from which action could possibly be launched against the Australian continent . The motive is not territorial imperialism ( the mainland is underexploited ) , nor a struggle for areas to penetrate with excess capital ( for capital is scarce at home ) , but exclusively the desire to insure their defenses . To the Australians and New Zealanders these islands are a natural rampart of defense . To-day it is not defense against European intruders , but against Japan . Thus it is clear that Australia and New Zealand have a profound interest in limiting the power and influence of Japan . They view the islands as a bulwark against Japanese penetration of the South Pacific . The policy of excluding immigrants from Asiatic countries is not as old as the island policy but it is far more vividly real to the general run of Australians . One may say that it is the foundation on which island policy really rests , for control of the islands is rationalized as a way of keeping the Asiatics out . The " White Australia " policy comes as near to being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It transcends party lines and , indeed , the Labor Party takes particular pride in its part in getting the policy written into Commonwealth law . To attack it means political death for the person or group so bold . Australian hostility to Asiatics first found expression in law as a result of conflicts between whites and Chinese on the gold diggings during the fifties and sixties of the past century . After a variety of experiments in keeping Chinese out of the country , some of which were actively deprecated by the Imperial government , the Australian attitude was summed up in the Commonwealth legislation on the subject in 1901 . Under the law then passed there is no avowed hostility to any racial group , but all undesirables are subjected to a language test which can readily be manipulated to achieve the desired end . The exclusion policy applies to more peoples than the Chinese and Japanese ; it applies to all yellow , black , and brown people ; and on occasion it has been used to keep out political " undesirables . " The Australian policy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the Australians have never found it possible to follow a consistent line . In recent years Far Eastern trade has of course been upset by internal conditions in the East beyond the control of outsiders . Broadly speaking , there are in Australia two schools of thought on Eastern trade . The first is supported by the primary producers , the academic economists , and their associates ; it favors pushing trade with the East . The other , supported by the manufacturers and most of the newspapers , while hardly objecting to the development of an export trade in primary products , fears and opposes the necessary concomitant , an import trade in Japanese products , especially manufactures . ( Australia has for forty years been devoted to the principle of high protective tariff and for thirty or more has been busily building up her industrial power . ) The position is further muddled by another consideration , the need felt for protecting the imperial interest of the United Kingdom in the Australian market . The trade war between Australia and Japan in 1936 illustrates the difficulty : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British goods in the Australian market as against Japanese competition ( rather than to protect Australian manufactures primarily ) , it really bore down most heavily on the wool exporters , for they suffered a loss of market in Japan which may well be permanent . The dispute ended in a truce , but the trade has never really recovered , for various intricate reasons including Japan 's concentration on the China affair . Nevertheless there is plenty of evidence that if and when the Far East achieves stability , the Australian interest in the Far Eastern market will be very strong indeed . For several years past students of the matter have been pointing out that the United Kingdom can not long continue to absorb the constantly increasing quantities of primary products which Australia ( and the other dominions ) would like to pour into it . The British authorities have lately given clear notice that Australia must look elsewhere for markets . The only logical place to look is the Far East . The issue is not acute to-day because , under war conditions , the United Kingdom is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because , under war conditions , the Far Eastern market is in such a disorderly state that trade expansion is unlikely anyhow . However , when the United Kingdom ceases to be at war and , therefore , ceases to take up all Australian surpluses , thus throwing the country back into the position of late 1938 and early 1939 , and when the Far East is pacified , Australia will perforce try to gain a share of the Eastern market , and will hope for a large and constantly increasing share . It is not relevant here to ask whether such a hope will be rational or irrational . The point is that the Australians will probably base their policy upon it . There is no reason at all for being skeptical about Australia 's capacity to produce the requisite goods if a market offers ; and few Australians indeed would fail to welcome the opportunity to expand the country 's productive capacity . But all we need attend to here is the fact that Australia desires , as a trading nation , a stable and progressive East . III @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand why Australia and the United States may find it relatively easy to arrive at an agreement about Pacific policy . The question is , how will such an agreement be implemented ? This carries us into the realm of Pacific naval strategy . It is generally understood that American naval strategy in the Pacific is based upon absolute control of the area defined by an arc extending from the Aleutian Islands of Alaska , southward to Pearl Harbor in the Hawaiian Islands , and so down to the Panama Canal . Mastery of that area is believed to be  |p565  assured . But from Pearl Harbor westward the position is not so clear . Assuming that any conflict would be with the Japanese , the strategists look forward to an immediate stalemate . Their search is for a way to break that stalemate . Early in 1939 the Pacific plans of a naval board under Rear Admiral Arthur J. Hepburn were revealed . They involved strengthening the American position by increasing the defensive utility of Guam , Wake Island , and Midway Island , all to the west of Hawaii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Aleutian Islands . In addition , this board recommended attention to Johnston and Palmyra Islands to the south of Hawaii . While these latter are an integral part of the arc of continental defense , they point toward the south and are of the first interest to us in our present quest . The United States has , in one way or another , been constantly stretching southward in recent years . The most obvious way is by establishing commercial air routes to New Zealand and Australia . In pursuit of this purpose the United States , in 1936 , asserted its claim to Baker , Howland , and Jarvis islands ( all south of Johnston and Palmyra ) . Canton Island , still farther south , is now under the joint administration of the United States and Great Britain . At least two air routes from the United States into the South Pacific have been pioneered and one or the other will soon come into active use . One runs from Hawaii south to Kingman Reef , Pago Pago , and Auckland , New Zealand . The other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island , to Noumea in the French possession of New Caledonia , and thence to Auckland . Both of these lines will eventually connect with a British trans-Tasman line to Sydney . On February 6 , 1940 , it was announced that the Civil Aeronautics Authority examiners recommended that a certificate be granted the Pan American Airways for a line to Auckland , presumably on the second route outlined . Very significantly the Authority cited it as " valuable to the national defense . " Pan American Airways of course already runs the China route via Hawaii , Midway , and Wake Islands , Guam , Manila , and Hongkong . It has been announced not long ago that an agreement was about to be made whereby the Dutch K.L.M. air line would establish a service between Batavia in Java and Manila , a connection which will allow passengers to go from Manila to Batavia , Penang , Darwin ( in the northern territory of Australia ) , and Sydney . The new Pan American line via Canton Island and Noumea will lead to the same destination and , by dipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insure constant air communication between the , , , United States and Australia . Why should the Civil Aeronautics Authority bother to say that the new Pan American line is " valuable to the national defense " ? In all likelihood precisely because it gives an almost unseverable contact with Australia . It is this which is all-important . Glance at the map of the Pacific and you will see that Japan , by taking over the German islands north of the equator , gained control of a curtain of islands which hangs directly between the United States and the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies , the bottom of the curtain being dangerously close to the northern boundary of the Australian possessions . If the United States is to help Australia it must somehow lessen the worth of the islands to Japan . For the Japanese have strengthened the worth of them in recent years by developing them , by pouring Japanese nationals into them until they outnumber the natives , by establishing an air line down through them , and by fortifying strategic points . The air line , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , runs by easy stages ? none as great as one thousand miles ? from Tokyo to Palau , a terminus which is within 1,500 miles of the Australian mainland . ( It is from Palau that Japan operates a pearling  |p566  fleet off the northern Australian coast in vigorous competition with the Australians . ) In addition , the Australians think that Japan has ignored the terms of her mandate , which forbids the establishment of fortifications , and that she has built strong bases at Truk in the Carolines and Jaluit in the Marshalls . The latter is about 3,000 miles from Sydney ; but it is more important that it is more than 4,000 miles from Singapore and hence beyond the easy reach of the British . It defends the logical line of approach to Australia from the north . In short , the Australians see the islands as a finger which points threateningly at them ; and they view with alarm the establishment of the air line and the suspected building of fortifications . They must seek to counterbalance the Japanese advantage . How they can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that something must be done is unquestionable ; for if Japan ever seriously moves south it is strongly felt that Australia 's jig is up . And the fear of Japan is strong in Australia . The Australians are especially disturbed because they are now beginning to wonder whether Britain will be able to assist in any important way in their defense , Singapore or no Singapore . This is an insidious thought which is eating silently at their self-confidence . Hardly admitted by official spokesmen , it is nevertheless widespread and has been openly expressed by persons whose views carry weight . No one acquainted with William Morris Hughes would for a moment suspect him of underestimating the power and glory of Britain , but in 1939 Mr. Hughes said : Hitherto the British Navy has ensured our security . But the old supremacy has gone : its powers are still most formidable , and although Britain would no doubt do her utmost to help us if need arose , she is no longer Mistress of the Seas , and as Admiral Sir Richard Webb , a former President of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to imagine that we are going to uncover the heart of the Empire and send our fleet thousands of miles into the Pacific with only one base , Singapore , for our supplies . and damaged ships , is to write us down as something more than fools . Anyway , the British public would never tolerate it . " As all students of Australian affairs know , the expectation of British aid in Australian defense is , after the trade and financial ties , the strongest material bond between the Commonwealth and Great Britain . Australia 's awakening to Britain 's weakness in the Pacific has done much to launch Australia on the course of developing a national policy in the Pacific . The ambiguity of Prime Minister Menzies 's formulation of the case , quoted above , simply illustrates the confusion into which Australian thought has been plunged by the realization that she is in danger of standing alone . And if she is not to stand alone , she must find her way into the American orbit , perhaps not as far into it as Canada has gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? but sufficiently far to afford some protection against the Japanese threat . And where Australia goes , New Zealand must necessarily follow . It is by reaching down round the southern boundary of the Japanese islands that the United States is going to make a contribution , not only to weakening the Japanese position in her own interest but also to strengthening Australia . How else interpret the stray hints , published and unpublished , about the purpose of American activities in this area ? How else can an air line running thousands of miles to the south of Panama be classified as " valuable to the national defense " ? Is not the Navy edging its activities southward toward Pago Pago ? It must not be forgotten that Pago Pago is the best harbor in the South Pacific islands and hence of vast potential naval utility . But is it not far outside the orbit of the United States as ordinarily conceived ? It is 2,300 miles from Hawaii , 5,600 miles from the Canal . But it is on the established ship-lanes to Australia and New Zealand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it has any naval ? or air ? significance it is in relation to these countries and  |p567  their sea approaches . And it is significant in this respect only if the United States has some program for aiding the southern dominions to maintain their present positions in the South Pacific region . To assist in maintaining the status quo would be the minimum program . The maximum program is not hard to envisage . Naval strategists have put forward the notion that one way of breaking the prospective stalemate between the United States and Japan in naval warfare is to strike to the south and , working up through the islands with light seacraft and airplanes , roll up Japan 's southern possessions with the purposes of cutting her off from the Indies , relieving the pressure on the Philippines , thus opening the air track from Hawaii , and , eventually , exerting a crushing pressure on the main Japanese islands themselves . Such a program if it were ever carried out would engage the support of the Australians , who would welcome the pushing back of Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad to be rid of the Japanese menace of their eastern flank , and the British , who would be glad to have pressure lessened on Singapore . Either the minimum or the maximum program would offer the Australians a priceless consideration for co-ordinating their Pacific policy with that of the United States . IV On what diplomatic precedents could such an Australian-American program rest ? It is not necessary to go farther back into history than the Washington Conference of 1921-1922 . One of the purposes of that conference was to replace the old Anglo-Japanese alliance with a treaty more acceptable to the United States . Canada supported the American desire to do away with the alliance , but Australia did not . On the contrary , it put considerable pressure on England to continue it . But the alliance was nevertheless discarded . Surveying the results of the Washington Conference , Senator the Right Honorable George Foster Pearce , Australia 's delegate , stated to Parliament that in his opinion closest attention should be given to the so-called " Four Power Treaty " with its supplements , coupled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naval Armament , " for they were what Australia really got in exchange for the old alliance . The gist of the " Four Power Treaty " is in Article I : " The High Contracting Parties agree as between themselves to respect their rights in relation to their insular possessions and insular dominions in the region of the Pacific Ocean . " Article XIX of the Naval Treaty provided that " The United States , the British Empire , and Japan agree that the status quo at the time of the signing of the present Treaty , with regard to fortifications and naval bases , shall be maintained in their respective territories and possessions . . . . " This latter article applied to insular possessions only , not to home territories . The new arrangement was received in Australia with mixed feelings . Professor Stephen Roberts comments as follows : ... the Australian Labor Party , for the most part , was pleased to be rid of any " Japanese entanglements " and to be released from an alliance which , in their opinion , might lead to trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had endorsed Prime Minister Hughes 's stand , and informed opinion in general in Australia tended to favor the old alliance rather than the new pact with its nebulous terms and its lack of sanctions . If one overlooks the implication that the Labor Party did not include " informed opinion " ? a typical example of Australian academic anti-Labor bias ? this is probably an accurate report . It is interesting also that Senator Pearce did not consider the Nine Power Treaty , which dealt with policy with regard to China , of major importance to Australia . Yet this is the treaty which , more than any other , embodies the traditional American Far Eastern policies . In 1922 the Australian conservatives were only mildly interested in these .  |p568  They were still beguiled by the notion that Great Britain was extremely powerful in the Far East and that the best guarantee of Australian safety was British power , not American political policy . In the past ten years the mystical faith in the British Navy has been weakened ; and it remains only to relate this directly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by F. W. Eggleston , a distinguished Australian public servant . Mr. Eggleston , seeking to justify the failure of Britain to cooperate with Secretary Henry Stimson in 1932 , concluded that : British diplomacy is subject to criticism , but there is one circumstance which entirely justifies the negative attitude of Great Britain to ideas of positive action against Japan , and which it was inadvisable at that time fully to disclose . That was her complete lack of military power in the Far East . This has been amply demonstrated lately , and it should not be beyond the comprehension of an intellectual to realize that in an era of more evenly distributed power it is impossible for Britain to do what she could do in the 19th century . This may be calamitous to the world , but in a fully armed world strategical considerations dominate . Mr. Eggleston 's apologetic damages Britain rather more than the accusation that she doublecrossed Mr. Stimson for purely political reasons . It is a confession that Britain is bankrupt in the Far East ; and the unstated corollary is that Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her existence . For if Britain is through , America is still powerful in the Pacific Ocean . The hard realities of Pacific politics are drawing the Australians into the American orbit ; and apparently Washington is actively encouraging the drift . As we have seen , parallel political policies exist on which to build a close agreement . These provide the foundation for a " functional " relation . But culturally there is a vast amount of hard work to be done before the average Australian has ordinary tolerance and understanding of American life and thought . And to-day the material interest of the Americans in the southern dominions is small indeed . Thus it will take time and adverse tides in British affairs to transform the " functional " relationship into that " organic " tie Prime Minister Menzies has said he wants . And the Australians must make it clear that in seeking shelter under the American wing they are acting in accordance with a fixed national policy , rather than merely trying to engage American help in a moment of extreme panic , only to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperial Pacific policy when it seems expedient . They must face the fact that the British Empire , considered as a coherent organization directed from London , has long been disintegrating ; that in the Pacific Basin it is to-day no longer effective ; and that if they are to accept the logic of evolution they must wholeheartedly enter into their national engagements with the United States , without any unexpressed but all-important " imperial " reservations . The American people can not be expected to welcome any scheme which , implicitly or explicitly , underwrites the imperial interests of Great Britain . The Americans , for their part , must ask themselves if they want to assume responsibility for a policy which entails heavy burdens . The Australian-American policy must be flung into the ring where the Continental Americans and the Imperial Americans do battle . It is plain that the State Department feels that it is necessary to undertake a large measure of responsibility in the South Pacific . What do the American people think ?  |p569              @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
