txt What is perhaps America'a most unique college , where every student already has a steady job , will reopen its classrooms here next Tuesday for the thirteenth consecutive year . A weekly school bell will ring thereafter for approximately 225 employes of Crown Willamette Paper Co. ( a division of Crown Zellerbach Corp. ) who want to know more about paper-making . They attend the Camas Paper School . believed to be the only one of its kind in the U. S. The workers themselves asked for this schooling : management did n't paternalistically propose it . Workers in Crown 's big specialty paper plant  --  some newcomers in their ' teens , others veterans up to 72 years  --  will enroll as freshmen on October 23 ; sophomores register the next day and juniors and seniors on October 25 . Some may be college graduates . others lack even a /ugh school education . But their objective is the same . After working hours , the various groups will put in classroom and shop studies on all phases of paper-making  --  from logging the tree that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College Credits Next spring some 70 ' or more seniors will receive diplomas at a public ceremony . What 's more , those diplomas will be worth 16 college credits that may be applied toward a degree in forestry , chemistry or engineering at the University of Washington or Oregon State College . In the past the school has been the means for many credit-shy college men or women . working at the plant , to obtain enough for a college sheepskin . But the 16 college credits awarded by the Camas Paper School are n't gifts , by any means . They must be earned . That means spending at least one evening is week at the Building , across the street from the plant , where students attend classes . Freshmen must attend a 11 , hour class weekly for 20 weeks Twenty - hour classes , ' plus 10 - plant visits of 11.2 hours each ' are required for sophomores Juniors and seniors ' attend 16 1i-hour classes , plus 64 hours of plant work -- all after working hours . School Helps Efficiency , Morale Officials of Crown Zellerbach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program pays real dividends in increased efficiency and improved morale , to mention only two . " We found many a worker , with five years service , who had never been in any other section of the plant . " said one official " When he finds out what goes on elsewhere , heobegtns to realize just what an important cog he is in the whole machine . " While no promises are held out to prospective students . officials admit that when promotions are in order , records of students and graduates of the school are taken into consideration , All records find their way to the personnel department . But in posters announcing opening of the school , nothing is said about a better job , no promise is made for an enlarged paycheck . Enrollment is purely voluntary . There is no tuition and no extra fees . The school holds attractions for workers of all ages . Youngest has been a boy of 16 ; oldest a 72-year-old mill mechanic who was completing his forty-eighth year as an employe . Before the war , the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Z5 years . In many cases , husband and wife , both employes , attend together , and it is n't unusual for a father and son to study the same subjects . Mill Bosses Are Faculty The school is supervised by a Board of Regents , made up of a vice president of the corporation and resident managers of the Camas and West Linn plants . Faculty members are mill superintendents and foremen . Dean is A. C. Natwick. assistant resident manager . The school is serious business to him and to the students . Take Joseph ' Brazney , for example . Joe works at the corporation 's plant at West Linn . Ore. , about 25 miles from Camas . When he graduated last June , he had traveled 4,290 miles to complete the four-year course . He also was one of the two honor students in the senior class , earning a week 's tour of other paper and pulp plants in the Pacific Northwest . with all expenses paid . Questionnaires reveal the same interest . William . World War I veteran , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elder was asked what he hoped to attain in paper school . he answered : " A knowledge of what goes on around here " Pim son wrote : " A future as an electrical engineer  --  and why not Crown Zellerbach ? " " Do n't Use Outsiders " Dean Natwick warns executives of other corporations planning industrial schools not to place the lecturing in the hands of outsiders . Experience at the Camas School has shown that the foremen and superintendents have the " feel " and become proficient as professors in a short time . At Camas , a textbook called Making Paper has been compiled from lectures given by men who are skilled , each in his own field . Emphasis , . however , is n't on any book , but on actual observation of operations in the mill itself . since its beginning , the school has graduated 1,606 students from one of the four classes ; 160 have completed the fourth year . Crown Zellerbach has found that it costs slightly under $15 a year for each student . This includes such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projectors , and other necessary equipment . Visual education is further aided by colored motion pictures showing the complete paper-making operation , from log rafts to the converted product . General Course For Freshmen No attempt is made to have the student specialize in his freshman year . Only the elementary and broad picture of fundamentals of chemistry , physics . electricity and wood . as they are related to paper making , are studied . The second year course is almost entirely concerned with wood preparation , pulp processing , and paper making , as carried on at the plant here . In the third and fourth year students must depend largely on their own initiative Eight formal lectures are given  --  practically all by outside speakers  --  on paper processes other than used in the plant here . Then there are lectures by union officers and by those who guide labor relations in the industry . Standards in the school are high . Students of the first and second-year classes are examined regularly through written " open book'examinations which they prepare on their own time , kith the aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courses , it is assumed to be moat important to the student 's benefit that he has fixed in his mind a well defined picture of pulp and paper-making operations by being required to review the instruction rather than to embarrass him , with the possibility of discouragement , by a method of examination whereby he would have to depend entirely on memory . " Dean Natwick explained " It is the aim to be as helpful to employes who did not complete grammar school as to the college graduate , to the extent of his own enthusiasm for bettering himself in his knowledge of pulp and paper-making . " Examination of third and fourth-year students , however , is different . They must rely on , memory , since it is assumed by now the std dent " should be able to write comprehensively upon any process of operation without recourse to notes or text " Students are encouraged with liberal awards , such ' as all-expense trips each summer for the twehonor students . Since the school first opened in 1933 , its fame has spread to many parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information came from the Scandinavian countries and Finland , and more recently one has come from India .
