It was the best of times , it was the worst of times . It was the time of humiliation and indignity for the establishment ; it was the time of the witch hunt . It was the time when the cold-war chickens came home to roost ; it was also the time when homosexuals were threatened with a hounding from the civil service . It was the time when the Royal Family was made to look agreeably ridiculous ; it was the time when loyalty tests were proposed for public employees . It was the time of the long-awaited exposure ; it was the time of the cover-up and the muddying of the waters . The case of Sir Anthony Blunt was , in short , a very British affair indeed . As British as the day is long . It had everything  --  the Royal Family , upper-crust homosexuality , Russian agents , Cambridge coteries  --  all woven together in a script that Graham Greene could have envied . All it lacked was an animal angle , ? though the public appetite for that kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeremy Thorpe and his shot dog . Where else but in England could a fairly senior agent of the K.G.B . make a full confession and then , far from being sent to prison , actually be given a plum job at Buckingham Palace ? And where else but in England would it be illegal to mention the fact even if you could discover it ? Even now , Blunt is able to use the Official Secrets Act to avoid answering any searching questions in public . The description of him in print , by the editor of a national Sunday newspaper , as " that treacherous Communist poof " is still the most that the average citizen knows . A little history is necessary here , in order to supply some context . In the mid-1960s , it was discovered that the leading figures of British intelligence , ' especially that section of it concerned with countering the Soviet Union , had been working for Moscow ' for more than two decades . They had allowed high-level Russian penetration of the Central Intelligence Agency ( which has distrusted its British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and agents . Not only this  --  but they had all safely escaped to Moscow after a tip-off . The one man actually caught , George Blake , was sentenced to life imprisonment , but the K.G.B . sprang him with almost contemptuous ease . H.A.R . ( Kim ) Philby , Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean all got off scot-free . Investigation showed that the three men had all been at Cambridge together , had all been accepted into military intelligence because their class backgrounds " fitted " and had ( with the exception of Philby ) been leading members of the homosexual demimonde that dominated Cambridge intellectual life in the 1930s . They also shared the experience of having been active and open members of the Communist Party at one time or another  --  something that seemed to have escaped the notice of their British employers if not their Russian ones . The public reaction to all this was , to put it mildly , one of open-mouthed disbelief . These revelations , which helped to bring about the collapse of the Conservative GovernMent in 1964 , led to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a time into one misleading but simple and powerful question  --  who had let them get away with it ? Ever since , the mystery of the " Fourth Man " ? the man who had recruited them , and who had then tipped them off to flee when the net was closing , has been a recurring theme of British novels , psychodramas , cocktail party punch-ups and political journalism . The unmasking of Blunt was typical . A senior BBC exec ; utive , Andrew Boyle , wrote a book called The Climate of Treason , ( published in the United States under the title The Fourth Man ) which was at first greeted with yawns because it purported to name the fourth " Fourth Man " to be named in two years . Attention began to concentrate , however , when it emerged that this fourth man was still alive ( the ' British laws on libel and official secrecy make it near-impossible to be rude about anyone rich , famous or power-ful who has more than three of the five senses . ) Boyle disguised Blunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maurice " ? a presumed reference to the hero of E.M . Forster 's posthumous gay novel , thus focusing.attention on Cambridge and what used to be known as " the queens of King 's . " It was left to the present author , in the New Statesman , to print the information that Maurice was Blunt , adding that for all that he was innocent and a harmless fellow . I was wrong there . The subsequent " naming " of Blunt in the House of Commons led to his admission that he had indeed signed up with the Soviet Union for the duration , while still a young man at Cambridge . He gave as his reason the softness of the British upper class in the face of nascent 1930s fascism . Here , though the British public has n't been told it , is the real connection with the Royal Family . The British upper crust ( " upper crust " being once defined as " a lot of crumbs held together by dough " ) was indeed fatally attracted to fascism at that period . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how extensive was the salon sadism of that time , and how it postponed rearmament against Hitler . The very reason that British intelligence was so easy to join in 1940 is the one unconsciously given by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in her statement - on the affair  --  that it was only in that year that they began to build up a staff to take on the Germans . The admission steaks volumes  --  though the implications were lost on most of the Tory party . p ossibly the most important pro-Nazi elitist was the King himself  --  that is to say Edward VIII , who was forced to abdicate only because he could n't keep his hands off an American divorc  --  e . After he became the Duke fof Windsor , his friendship with Hitler became notorious , ' and there is some evidence that the Fuhrer planned to install him as regent of Britain if things had gone the other way . Now , after the war was over , King George VI dispatched Blunt  --  then still a trusted British agent  --  to Germany to recover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This task he performed with commendable zeal . Thus the wheel came , as they say , full circle . The patriotic element of the ruling class sent a secret Stalinist member of the same class to clear up the dirty Nazi past of yet another member . And it was all kept in the family for another thirty years . ( Indeed , it might not be irrelevant to point out that Blunt is the Queen 's third cousin once removed . ) No wonder that , when Blunt was finally forced to confess his role in the Russian penetration of British intelligence , the Royal Family kept him on as Surveyor of the Queen 's Pictures . No wonder that the political leadership of the country was kept in ignorance of the deal until it had become a fait accompli ; impossible to undo without compromising the holy of holies herself . No wonder that Blunt was given a free pardon and a knighthood while lesser fry were sent to prison forever . No wonder the outrage and embarrassment of the establishment upon finding out that the long-looked-for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along . The British establishment is not a pretty sight when rattled . Blunt 's knighthood was stripped from him in a rare display of regal pettishness at his temerity in breaking the Eleventh Commandment , which prohibits being found out . ( In the same way , Philby in Moscow fifteen years ago received a letter from Buckingham Palace revoking his membership in the Order of the British Empire  --  thus giving him the first belly laugh he 'd had in months . ) Then the hunt really began . There were demands that all queers and subversives be vetted to make sure they held no " sensitive " jobs . Blunt 's friends and colleagues started , to receive ill-mannered late-night calls from people with cut-glass accents . Mr. Julian Amery , a leading Tory right-wing Member of Parliament whose brother was hanged at Nuremberg for recruiting British prisoners of war to join Hitler 's army ( he managed to get a dozen or so ) , claimed to have the names of a dozen Labor M.P.s whose loyalty was to the Russian Embassy . Pressed to give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great British proletarian saying , " he had left his cock in his spare pair of pants . " Best of all was The Times , newly returned , to the newsstands after a ludicrous and costly lockout . Their editorial on the subject recalled that John Maynard Keynes had been a leading light in the Cambridge of the period , and suggested that his attitude to iron economic laws such as the gold standard was determined by his rejection of what it called " conventional sexual morality . " This novel idea  --  that sodomy is the cause of inflation  --  was perhaps the monetarist explanation of treason . Nobody had the temerity to remind The Times of its consistent record of support for appeasement in the 1930s and its editorial decision to do nothing to antagonize Hitler until after he had digested Czechoslovakia in 1938 . This confusion  --  of the Comintern with the Homintern as you might say  --  generated rather more heat than light . It was barely noticed that Blunt 's own statement , which had been cleared by the Cabinet , specifically denied that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to passing German intelligence material to Russia . The effect of this statement was to establish Blunt as a traitor all right ( he does admit to helping the spies to escape in the 1960s ) , but not as the Fourth Man or the mole . Of course , the entire idea of there being one demonic and brilliant individual responsible is absurd . It serves the paranoid elements of the left and the right  --  the former who believe in a corrupt and Vichy-minded establishment and the latter who see a homosexual Marxist conspiring against the nation 's bodily fluids . But totems such as this are cherished , and it will take the country a long time to wean itself from a diet of John Le Carre and Ian Fleming . One small victory was , however , gained . In the course of his researches , Boyle found the usual wall'of secrecy , protecting all the British sources . Insofar as his material has any factual virtue , it derives from his having taken a plane to Washington and made use of the Freedom of Information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislators that none of the Blunt revelations could even have been discussed if our new Protection of Information Bill was . passed . Having insisted upon it at the beginning of the week of the revelations , Mrs. Thatcher announced that it would be dropped " for the time being . " Which is something . The fact that so many facile conclusions have been drawn does not mean that the affair is a meaningless farce . Properly considered , away from the hysterics of Fleet Street , it reminds us that treachery and sabotage in Britain have always been the prerogatives of the self-appointed elite and the hereditary system : those who really do believe that they have a right to rule and that they are above any sectional or national interest . Even in their attachment to Communism  --  fleeting as it was  --  such people waited until it looked as if Stalin might be going to win , and deserted him when it became clear that he was n't . The affair should also have educated new generations in the past complicity of British Governments with Hitler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most dangerous enemy the country ( or any other country ) ever had . Finally , the whole Blunt saga should have brought home the need for open government and for free information . Instead , there has been an atmosphere of vindictive recrimination , dark suggestions that there are " more names to come , " foul innuendoes about homosexuals and an exclusive concentration on Blunt 's " fellow traveling . " Against that you can score one for open government , but it is n't much of a consolation . Forster 's remark , that if faced with a choice between betraying his country and betraying his friends he hoped he would have the courage to betray his country , has often been taken as the epitome of faggot detachment and effete pacifism . The secret it really holds is the clue to the British establishment mentality  --  which always has put class before country , interest before patriotism , while claiming to speak in the most resonant national mode .
