 | That evening while he was swilling the hogs , Hulda came and stood in front of him . Did you look through the window ? ' she asked . I did n't see anything , ' he said . Are you going to tell ? ' she asked . I did n't see anything , ' he insisted . If you do n't tell , I 'll give you a kiss , ' Hulda said . And if you do tell , I do n't care . ' I 'm not going to tell anything and I would n't kiss you for a hundred dollars , ' said Lemuel , brushing past her as well as he could , with two pails of swill . His face burned a long time . As soon as supper was finished , Joe Musser took the Ohio Farmer and went out on the back porch . Hulda helped with the dishes , then she put on a blue dress and went out on the front porch to wait for her beau . Mrs. Musser set to work at baking some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , so he sat at the kitchen table . He read the Kerriston Intelligencer all the way through , and then he started reading some of the more tedious parts the second time . He dreaded going to his room because he knew he was going to be homesick . Finally , the steady clatter of Mrs. Musser 's tongue drove Lemuel out of the kitchen . The moon was coming up , low and large . He thought he would take a walk down the road . In the moonlight , trees and bushes took on strange shapes . They were not frightening , but they were kind of weird and sad . From the little hill south of the orchard , Lemuel could look out over the whole township , lying vague and blue-white in the moonlight . It looked so lonesome.  | Lemuel walked as far as the creek and sat down for a while on a culvert stone . At Grandpa Nadeli 's , Grandma would be sitting in her cheerful , friendly kitchen reading the Bible , sucking the supper bones , scratching the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozed over his Tolstoy . At Ora 's , Barbara would be coming out of the kitchen , putting glycerin and rosewater on her hands after the dishwashing , and Ora would be joking and cutting up . Clyde , who was putting in most of the summer there as a hand , was probably whittling . In New York , his mother would be sitting beside the library table , sewing , while his father read to her out of the newspaper . Love and loneliness swirled like freshet waters over his heart . Even though he had set his jaw , the homesickness came when he went to his room ; as he had known it would . This was not just lonesomeness : not just an unhappiness of the spirit . It was sickness , acute and radical . It was physical as well as spiritual and mental . His stomach hurt as if he had been kicked ; he needed to vomit and could not . Cold sweat stood on him as he lay on the bed , tight-lipped , hot-eyed , beating the pillow with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to find rest . At last , when he was drained , he fell unconscious from exhaustion . In the morning Mrs. Musser asked whether Lemuel had been homesick and he lied and said , No . ' I allowed you would n't be , ' she said , because I scraped the threshold and put the scraping in with the coffee grounds . That 's a sure remedy . '  | When Lemuel came in from the morning chores to eat his breakfast , he saw on the back porch an old dishpan and a small paddle . These remained a mystery to him until after breakfast when Mrs. Musser said , Lemuel , I hope you 'll have time to help me fix that busted grape arbor after you get through with the potato bugs . ' Potato bugs , ' thought Lemuel . It was a new one to him . Luckily , the potato patch was in the direction of the Hoon house , where the nearest neighbors lived . Blinky Hoon , the oldest boy , had eyelids which drooped as if he were always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head to look at you . Lemuel went on across the road to where Blinky was fixing fence . What do you do about potato bugs ? ' Lemuel inquired . Blinky tried hard to think of a joke to play on Lemuel , but he could n't rise to the occasion . So he dropped his work and showed Lemuel how you walk between two rows of potatoes and knock the bugs off the leaves into the dishpan with the paddle . That 's all there is to it , ' he said . The potato bugs came in two varieties . Most of them were small reddish blobs that looked as much like worms as they did like bugs . The others were hardshells , and had stripes . They made a solid clunk when they were knocked against the side of the dishpan . Lemuel soon learned to lift up the potato vines to look underneath . Before long he had about two quarts of squirming bugs in the dishpan , and it was getting hard to carry . He fetched an old bucket from the rubbish heap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he took a fresh start .  | It was a hot day . Lemuel 's back began to ache from so much stooping , and the sun , striking down on him , baked the ache into his back . He resorted to the device that usually helped him . He began to imagine a dramatic situation in which he was a central and heroic figure . He was a boy champion rifle shot . He was paddling potato bugs , but not at Mussers ' . It was at Ora 's place . The potato patch was back of the big fence , across the gully from the house . From there Lemuel could see the house , four hundred yards away . A swarthy man knocked at the back door . Lemuel did not like his looks . He looked like a Confederate or a Hessian or a Cornwallis redcoat . Lemuel dropped his dishpan and crouched down behind the hedge , his trusty rifle ( named Excalibur ) in his arms . Barbara came to the door . The Cornwallis redcoat whipped out a revolver and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to Lemuel 's shoulder and issued a sharp , loud bang . The gun flew from the redcoat 's hand . The redcoat turned tail and fled . Barbara waved toward the potato patch , a wave of loving gratitude . Lemuel discovered himself in Mussers ' potato patch , paddling the potato bugs . There was a spring-house at the Musser place . It stood halfway down the side hill on the far side of the garden . A garden path connected it with the house . Another path wound its way up the hillside toward the barn . From the outside , the spring-house was just a rattletrap old shed . Its rear wall was the hillside . Capes and peninsulas of sod and moss grew out upon its roof . The boards of its sides were slate-gray : the color that unpainted wood takes on after thirty or forty years out in the weather .  | Time had eaten away the soft part of the grain in the wood and the wet and the dry had curled the edges of the board . If you looked closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boards fast to the hand-hewn timbers were the old-fashioned square-headed kind . The door 's hinges were leather ? sections of an old pair of tugs . Its catch was a hand-worn cross-piece that turned on an old and rusty bolt . At one side of the door , a moss-covered wooden spout spilled a small trickle of water among some stones . Peppery watercress grew there , and sometimes the frogs came up from the creek to sit there booming . When you opened the door , a cool and cellarly , a damp and earthy smell came out . You could see the spile that came out of the side of the hill , dribbling its small but constant offering of water into the shallow trough . The trough took up one whole side of the spring-house . The water in it was about four inches deep , excepting at one place where a deep place had been dug , big enough to take four ten-gallon milk-cans , deep enough to cover them to their throats . The water in the trough was icy cold . The hotter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The evening 's milk stayed there overnight , and the morning 's milk was put there for a half-hour to chill . Wide crocks took up the space in the shallower part of the trough . They were wide and shallow , so the cream could easily be skimmed from them . The churn stood on the opposite side of the spring-house . A small green snake lived there , and Joe would not let it be killed . The most frequent visitor to the spring-house was Joe . The others were satisfied with the water from the kitchen well or  | the deep well at the barn . Joe thought the spring water was better and went to extra trouble to drink it . Sometimes he brought along a half-dozen bottles of beer from town and cooled them in the spring water . When Joe was working around the barn , his mid-afternoon lunch was a piece of bread dipped into a milk crock and lifted carefully so it would be covered with firm cream . One day he beckoned Lemuel to come with him . It was a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat . Joe held his wrists under the trickle of the spring . Lemuel followed his example , and right away he felt cool . Well , ' said Will Schmotzer , taking a handful of tenpenny nails out of a keg and dropping them into the big brass hod of the scales , how are you getting along with Joe Musser ? ' Pretty good , ' said Lemuel . Has he talked a leg off of you yet ? ' asked Johnny Speaker , looking on . Not yet , ' said Lemuel . What I ca n't see , ' continued Johnny , is how anybody can get along with a fellow that 's always shooting off his bazoo like Joe does . ' Leaving all fooling to one side , ' said Schmotzer , has he said a word to you yet ? ' Two or three , ' Lemuel said . Did he tell you to come here for these nails and the mower teeth ? ' Schmotzer pursued . Well , no , ' Lemuel said . The Missis told me what he wanted me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnny . I often wonder when he even talks to her . '  | What makes him like that ? ' Lemuel asked . Grand opera , ' Johnny piped in . Did n't you ever hear the story ? ' Schmotzer asked . No , I did n't , ' said Lemuel . Why , ' said Schmotzer , it happened , I 'd judge , twenty years or more ago . I mind Joe when he was a young fellow . He had the deepest voice on him you ever heard on a man . It sounded like he was talking through a barrel . In them days , that was considered odd . They called him Bull-Frog Musser . In school the teacher told him not to sing because it made the other young ones laugh . Same at church . The preacher did n't like to hear Joe beller because it seemed out of place for a noise like that to be rising up in a church . Joe 's a powerful good-natured man , and it seemed he just accepted the fact that his voice was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never was what you would call a great talker , but he talked as much as most fellows . Then one summer Pete Perrenod 's sister that 's a big singer in New York in some grand-opera doings come out to visit Pete 's . ' Pete 's lodge over at Lodi give a dance for her . Seems that Joe , the minute he laid eyes on her ? he was a single man , then ? spoke up and said to Charley Amstutz , " There 's the one for me . " In the meantime , it seems she heard his voice and took to raving about it . She said he was a bassy-bassundo , the way I recall it . When Joe asks her to dance , she ups and asks him why he ai n't in grand opera . Joe , of course , thought she was giving him the josh , and being a sensitive fellow , he just turned around and walked out . He never spoke to her after that , and as far as that 's concerned , he just about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first night of homesickness , the second one did n't seem so bad . Homesickness , Lemuel found , is like a cold that settles in the back . It comes back day after day , but every day it 's a little easier . As his homesickness waned , his interest in the job grew . He was getting used to his new home and getting to feel at home in his new duties . Joe Musser 's silence made the job a sort of game . Every time Lemuel figured out what Joe wanted him to do , he felt as if he had scored a point . Along with that , he began to feel very friendly toward Joe . He found that a couple of hours of working or sitting with Joe left him feeling just as sociable as if they had been talking all the time . Joe , he found , liked being talked to , so he jabbered about whatever came into his head . When he felt like being quiet , that seemed to be all right , too . Lemuel could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got kind of tired listening to her and he found himself getting headaches because he was keeping a polite smile on his face all the time he was listening . But there was a kind-heartedness about her that could n't help make you feel friendly . She seemed to take it for her job to see that everybody had all the comforts . She never spared herself if she could cook something the way Joe or Hulda or Lemuel liked it by working an hour or two more . The other women had begun buying bread from the baker wagon that came around . But Joe liked hot bread . So she baked so he could have it once a week . With Hulda , Lemuel simply was n't getting along . They did n't antagonize each other , because they kept out of each  | other 's way . The question of whether they were going to be friends or enemies was suspended . Lemuel was shy of her because he had n't known a boy-crazy girl before . She was shy of him because he was not her kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it was a gray-and-white cat , called Two-Color , that became Lemuel 's first friend . The cat was born to have a friend . Its first friend was a bull calf . When the calf was two years old , Joe sold it . The first time Lemuel saw the cat , it was lying in the young bull 's deserted manger , mewing every few seconds . Lemuel petted it . The cat followed him away . It followed him to the field . After that , it followed him everywhere but into the house . When he was inside , it curled up beside the cistern pump and waited for him . When Lemuel milked , he squirted milk on the cat as Uncle Simon did with his cats . When Two-Color had licked the milk from its fur and dried itself off , it jumped onto Lemuel 's shoulder , and sat there till he finished milking . Lemuel was sitting on the swing dreamily watching a big man riding up the road on a big horse . The man and the horse were strangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man was . He was surprised when the man reined in and called out to him . You the boss of this shebang ? ' No , sir , ' said Lemuel . Who is ? ' Mr. Joe Musser . ' Is he around here ? ' Lemuel led the stranger to Joe on the back porch .  | The stranger rode his horse up to the porch and said , You 're Joe Musser , I surmise . ' Joe nodded . Name 's Bailiff . Hawk Bailiff , they call me , short for Hawkins . I 'm from down state a piece . Perry County . Me and my team are working on this pipe-line job down the road here . Been with them all the way . I been staying at Grove Maxwell 's place down beyond Cherrytree , but the work 's pushed so far up the road that I 'm looking for a new boarding-place . Wondered if you 'd care about taking on a roomer and a couple of horses to stable . ' Joe looked a little helpless , or bewildered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to urge you none at all , ' he said sincerely . If people do n't want anybody else in the house , they do n't want ' em at all . Do n't want to force my way in nohow . But I will say I 'm no trouble for a family . I 'd just as soon sleep in the hay as in a bed , and I do my own wash . All I need is fodder for the horses and grub for myself . I 'm willing to pay a dollar a day for it . ' Joe 's big voice boomed out so deep that the stranger was visibly surprised . I 'll see the woman , ' he said , and went into the kitchen . Mrs. Musser came out , wiping her hands on her apron . She had heard the stranger 's talk and she did n't let on that she had n't been listening . " Evening , mam , ' the stranger said , sweeping the air with his hat . I ? ' She interrupted him . You 're welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no sense talking about sleeping in the hay , and a dollar a day is too much . Five a week for you and the  | horses is a big plenty . You can either sleep with Lemuel here or in the hall . Lemuel was here first , so he 's got a claim on the spare bed . ' Lemuel , eh ? ' said the stranger . Bub , how about it ? Will you bunk with me ? ' Yes , sir , ' said Lemuel . Fair enough , ' the stranger said . If you snore , I 'll outsnore you , and if you kick , I 'll kick right back . We 'll make a pair of pardners , eh ? All right , man . I 'll move in tomorrow , if you 're willing . Good . And a dollar a day is the pay . ' Evening , all . ' Shortly before six the next evening Hawk arrived riding one horse and leading the other . Both horses were wearing their harness . It was handsome harness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , white , and blue rings and all the buckles were burnished brass . Lemuel showed him which were their stables . Hawk Bailiff cast an eye at the floor deep in straw and the manger full of hay and he said : Looka here , bub . You let me do my own chores , will you ? You 're giving me more than what I 'm paying for . ' That 's nothing , ' said Lemuel . What do you feed them ? ' General gets two quarts of oats and six ears of corn , and Marthy gets a little extra oats and only four ears . ' At the supper table Mrs. Musser asked Hawk the questions . Are you married ? ' she asked . Well , now , ' he said , I ca n't say as I am . Never could find me a woman that would have me . ' Hulda giggled . No , mam , ' he continued , I 'm what you might call a poor old batch . '  | Ai n't you got any womenfolks at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm well supplied that way . I got four old-maid sisters that keep house for me in the old homestead . ' Is that all that live there , you and your four sisters ? ' Them and the two share-farmers and their families . ' You must have quite a big place , ' Mrs. Musser simpered . When supper was over , Mr. Bailiff ' went out to smoke his pipe , saying , I wo n't smoke up your house with my stinkbox . ' That man , ' Mrs. Musser said to Hulda and Lemuel , is a-looking for him a woman . He 's got all the signs on him . A man that 's got a big enough place for two share-farmers to work do n't need to do no teaming on no pipe-line . He 's a-looking . ' Hulda giggled . You can snicker , ' her mother said . I only wisht you was three years older than what you are . He 'd make you a better man than ever that Sweeny will . ' Hawk Bailiff ' was sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoking his pipe . Lemuel did n't want to intrude , but he walked past trying to give the impression that he was going somewhere but did n't really have to . Hello , pardner , ' said Hawk . Got your chores all done ? ' Yes , sir , ' said Lemuel . He climbed up and sat down beside Hawk . They sat in silence , watching the sun flatten out on the horizon before it finally dipped . You curious at all ? ' asked Hawk . I mean about why a fellow with ground to take care of would go out working on the pipe-line ? '  | No , ' lied Lemuel . Fair enough , ' said Hawk . They sat without talking until the mosquitoes began to bother them . The corncrib was an openwork building of considerable age . It looked as if it were about to lie down on one side and prop itself up on its elbow . This was because one corner sagged . The roof dished in like the spine of a swaybacked horse . In spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure . The six blocks of wood on which it rested had settled all they were ever going to settle . A hurricane would have upset the house before it bothered the corncrib . It had snuggled into space and time . The siding of the corncrib was put on with an inch between each board and the next one . Its walls , thus , offered the corn no shelter . They merely contained it . The corncrib was , in effect , a big wicker basket with a roof . The roof did n't mean much to the rain or the snow . In the winter , the snow was a foot deep on the corn . The corn did n't mind that , as long as it had air . The corncrib was narrower at the bottom than it was at the eaves . Why this was , Lemuel never knew . He asked several men and got facetious answers . One said that a corncrib was really for holding sauerkraut , and that its shape made it easier for the juice to run out . Under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leghorn hens had chosen the ground under the fore part of the crib as their summer resort . They had dug out deep dustwallows there in which they sat on hot afternoons , ruffling their feathers and taking baths in the fine yellowish dust .  | They liked the place especially because now and then a few grains of corn fell between the floor-boards when Lemuel scooped up the basketful which went to the hogs night and morning . The fat black cat watched over their kaffee-klatsches . She had a favorite niche between one of the middle supporting stumps and the floor-boards ( the beams gave her a few inches of leeway ) . Here she lay during the greater part of the day and night , watching for the young rats . They lived in a hollow place at the butt of one of the rear supports . It was a cozy nest , warm with corn husks and pink bits of corncob , and there were several ways of getting in and out of it . The rats liked the corn . They had gnawed several holes through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were found , Joe covered them with tin . The rats patiently started work somewhere else . A big pile of what almost amounted to rubbish at the middle of the corncrib 's underworld saved them from the constant surveillance of the black cat . The heap included old plowpoints , mower parts , and other stuff ' bought at public vendues . Joe put it under the corncrib to keep dry until need arose . The rats had worked out several hideaways and secret passages through this junk . The cat was afraid of the grown rats , and they knew it . But she would tackle a young rat . This merely taught the young rats the desirability of caution and community action . In the summer , when the heap of corn grew low , field mice that had been brought in with the corn at the harvest and had lived all winter in secure pockets deep in the heap , dived out of the crib and scampered for the fields .  | Joe Musser went to the building that was called the shop and took down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , he stroked the blade with a whetstone , giving it long , rhythmic sweeps . At the gate to the wheatfield , which was at the corner nearest the barn , he laid down the cradle and tore off a head of wheat . He rubbed it between his hands until the grain was clear of the chaff , then he blew the chaff away . He threw the wheat into his mouth and chewed it . Lemuel thrashed a head of wheat , too , and chewed it . The wheat was dry and hard ? completely ripe . When it was chewed , it got to be like chewing gum , and the longer you chewed it the sweeter it got . Joe took up the cradle and set to work . With a long swing into which his whole body entered , he cut off a swath of the standing grain , which lay , when the blade had severed it , on the parallel arms of the cradle . With a graceful movement , Joe laid the gathered swath on the ground , drawing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another sweep . Lemuel watched with admiration . He knew good cradling now , and he saw that Joe was doing a good job . Lemuel gathered the wheat into armfuls and tied it into sheaves . He did not use string , but wisps of the wheat itself , as Uncle Simon had taught him the year before . It was the way wheat was bound before there were binders . You took a handful of the long-strawed grain , divided it , gave the heads a twist , and wrapped it around the sheaf so that the twist was underneath : held fast by the tightness . Then you twisted the butt ends of the two wisps on the other side of the sheaf , and turned the twist under there . When  | Lemuel had made eight sheaves , he set them up into a shock , and spread out two more sheaves with which to cap the shock . Lemuel understood that Joe would harvest his wheat , for the most part , with the binder which he had spent several evenings oiling , and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would do the chores alone the next morning ; that Joe would be up at daybreak to finish the cradling . The next day was the Fourth of July , when they were going to cut the wheat . The thrill there is in starting a new job ? the thrill that makes many a man love farming ? came to Lemuel . The Fourth was a hot day . There were no clouds in the sky . Around the edges , the intense blue faded off into a hot and sultry haze . From the house , the people working in the field looked motionless and remote , like a picture on the small side of a lens . But in the wheatfield there was excitement and action . The three big horses , agitated by the great urgent clatter of the machine behind them , stepped out with lively , highkneed strides . The binder , drawn at the brisk walk , sang in every cog . It was a gallant picture : the horses stepping out , the great reel of the binder turning , Joe on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braced on the foot levers , his straw hatbrim blown back by the speed of their motion , the wheat falling in docile concert on the platform and the clacking webs carrying it up into the machine , the shining arm of the knotter jerking out at regular intervals like the head of an intelligent snake , the bundles falling bound on the long slender fingers of the carrier , and the carrier itself gently laying the bundles down in bunches of four .  | Mrs. Musser ran beside the binder on its first two rounds . A sudden spryness invested her . Her gait was a spirited trotand-hobble . She was the mechanical brains of her family . If something was going wrong , her ear would tell her and locate the trouble . She was proud of her importance in her extraordinary duty . In the shade of her sunbonnet her face shone like an excited small female sun . Dressed in a pink calico dress and a modified sunbonnet that was like a picture hat , Hulda was on hand , too , to help with the shocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction crew was not working on account of the holiday , had declared himself to be a champion wheat-shocker . He challenged Lemuel and Hulda , working together , to keep up with him . They did n't . Hulda would have been a speedier worker if she had n't been afraid of snakes . She had to scrutinize every clod on which she put her foot , and every time a creeper , caught by somebody 's toe , moved its length in the stubble , she gave a squeal and jumped to one side , clutching her throat with her hands . At eleven o'clock Mrs. Musser trudged toward the house . An hour later , when Lemuel was beginning to wonder when they were going to start back to the house for dinner , she appeared in the lane driving the old lame horse in the light spring wagon . There were hay and oats in the back of the wagon for the horses that drew the binder , and in two big baskets in the seat was a meal for the human workers . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baked beans , eggs pickled in beet juice , fried cakes . The coffee was hot in a two-gallon jug .  | They ate in the shade of the large maple tree . Far away , on the road , buggies and surreys went by , carrying people who were going to town or Beech Grove for the Fourth-ofJuly doings . But they ate in merriment and resumed their work with gaiety . They did not envy the holiday-makers . Lemuel , ' said Hawk Bailiff , do you feel like listening ? ' They were leaning against the lane fence . A particularly red sun was sinking , all out of shape , beyond the wheatstubble . Sure , ' said Lemuel . Good , ' said Hawk Bailiff , because I feel like talking . I feel like talking to you because you 're interested in things , but you 've got too much sense and good manners to be nosey . You never asked me why a fellow with a farm to run is off driving a team on a pipe-line job , one hundred miles away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . Most of them seem to think I 'm looking for a woman to marry . There 's nothing to that . When you come right down to it , the real reason why I 'm gadding around with a team and a dump wagon does n't sound like enough of a reason .... I do it because I like to make friends . Now , the average fellow would think that was a mighty poor excuse . That 's because the average fellow is in the habit of being satisfied with what he 's sent in the way of relatives and neighbors . Of course , I do n't want to say anything about my kin or the people that live where I do . They 're fine people . But there are n't enough of them . When I get to thinking about just spending my life all in one place , never knowing anybody  | but the people thereabouts , it like to drive me crazy . There 's real fun in getting to know a fellow and seeing him get to know you . Does that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' said Lemuel . If I had n't come here from New York , I would never have known the finest people there are in the world . ' That 's it . That 's it . Providence does n't just put them in the same township where you 're born . You 've got to go out and expose yourself to them . That line of thinking has been with me since I was old enough to dress myself . When I was twelve years old , it got strong enough so as to make me run away from home . ' You did ? ' I sure did . I run away from home , and before I come back , I had been twice to South America and clear around the world and three years before the mast in the Indian Ocean . ' My land ! ' said Lemuel .

I did it , but I 'm blamed if I can stay there twelve months a year , and year in , year out . No , sir . That 's why I 'm teaming on the line . '  | C H A P T E R T W O RURAL PATRIARCHY WHEN Hawk Bailiff was ten , his great-grandfather , Valentine , still slept in the bed where he was born . The younger people often wondered how he could stand it . Instead of springs the bed had a net of rope . Instead of a mattress it had a tick of husks . Valentine Bailiff , at ninety-six , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was so old , he slept in a locked room , and rose by his own waking . In winter he washed at the commode with its big pitcher and basin . In summer he put on an old raincoat and went out behind the barn , where he took off the coat and dumped three buckets of water on his head . On his way downstairs every morning the old man passed the tall old clock which had been bought on the day of his birth . On the inner wall of the case , behind the pendulum , were the names and birth dates of his descendants . There were two sets of dates for those who had died . Every Saturday Old Valentine opened the clock 's tall door and carefully raised the heavy weights . He compared the time on the clock to that on his great silver watch . The clock was always right . The house had three stairways , and the one the old man used came down into the parlor . Another came out in the vestibule and the third in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father had built , and the rest of the house was built around it . His father had increased the house to six rooms and he had made it fourteen . At this time the  | house had twenty rooms , some of which were only opened in the fall and spring for cleaning . That Fourth of July when Hawk was ten there were four generations of men in the fringed-topped surrey which carried them home from the exercises in the township center . Hawk 's father , Emory , and his grandfather , Wiles , sat in the front seat , and the boy was in the rear seat with the greatgrandfather . It was a hot , sleepy day . The two sorrel horses , in leather fly-nets , trotted lazily . A thin wake of dust behind the surrey drifted idly toward the north side of the road , where it settled on the leaves of the tall weeds and the tangled fence-brush . The road led through tilled fields . Here and there wheat had been cut and a fringe of golden shocks surrounded a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dappled with spots where the wind had broken the straw , were turning from green to yellow . The boy was both bored and excited . He had looked forward to the celebration , and some of the enthusiasm remained , but the exercises had grown terribly , tediously long . He remembered nothing of what the congressman had said . It had become a rising and falling stream of meaningless sounds . In fact , he had got into a hypnotic state , and even the rising and singing , and the quartet of women dressed in white with red and blue ribbons , had been like something which took place in some of the dreams he had when he grew feverish . After exchanging a few words , Hawk 's father and grandfather up front had dismissed the speaker of the day as a pusillanimous shyster . ' Now they only made occasional remarks , as when his father said , I see Kinch has got all his clover in finally . '  | Old Valentine Bailiff had slept through most of the ceremony , but he was awake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jaw worked his toothless gums together , as it always did when he had something intensely on his mind . Locusts sawed in the still air . A buggyload of strange townspeople passed , and Emory Bailiff and his father bowed to them . Hawk , only half awake , was dreaming a dream in which he sailed the Mediterranean with the Italian nobleman who had married Aunt Valeria while she was studying music in Rome . He often thought of that fabulous couple when he was in the dark , shady parlor and looked at the sepulchral grand piano on which she had played her first exercises . It 's a pack of nonsense ! ' Valentine Bailiff muttered suddenly . Young Hawk jerked out of his dream and looked sidewise at the old man . His jaw was n't working any longer . He was sitting up straight and motioning with his cane . Wiles Bailiff , in his Grand Army uniform , turned around . Nonsense , eh ? ' he asked . Damned British nonsense , ' the old man said . They did n't act that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy , every American was a king and he acted like a king . When I was a boy , I went to a Fourth-of-July doings . If there was a speech , the speaker was there because he had something to say . If he 'd a-talked a lot of loud foolishness like that whippersnapper today , we 'd a-run him out of the state . After the speaking , the president of the day would get up and say , " Citizens , we are now going to sing the national anthem , and any man that feels himself below the level of a king can take off his damned hat . "  | And nobody took off his hat . A king do n't take off his hat when you sing the national anthem . That was before our womenfolk started going to England ? he and she womenfolks . If there 's anything worse than a she-woman , it 's a he-woman like Alexander Hamilton . They went to England and they saw that the nobles take off their hats . So they came home and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country . Now we 're just subjects . That 's what 's the matter with this country ! ' The patriarch settled back against the seat and was silent . The boy 's grandfather cleared his throat . Times change , pa , ' he said . Hawk was busy covering with his Stevens a group of ruffled aristocrats who were trying to make George Washington take off his three-cornered hat .  | C H A P T E R T H R E E THE RETURN IT CAME over Lemuel all of a sudden that he was sick of being a hired man at Joe Musser 's . He was feeding the hogs . He had emptied into the trough the bucket that contained the kitchen swill and he was reaching for the bucket of mash and water , when it came over him . For a few moments he stayed motionless in that bent-over position . Then , slowly , like someone in a sort of daze , he gave the chanting hogs the second helping . It was not like being homesick . Homesickness is a sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't go home . It was n't like that with Lemuel . It was a sudden realization that , one way or another , he had to get out of the situation he was in . Underneath the surface of his mind , his unhappiness had been growing . Like a man subject to a misery about which nothing can be done , he simply kept himself from thinking about it . But the cup had run over . Guided by habit , he went about his chores . Without realizing that he had climbed the ladder , he found himself in the haymow , throwing down timothy . The back of his mind was arranging the items of his unhappiness like a new display of merchandise in a window . He did n't want to have to figure out what Joe Musser wanted him to do just because Joe preferred not to give orders . He did n't want to hear Mrs. Musser talk-talk-talk , always figuring out when a thing happened by relating it to some anniversary .  | It came to him that he hated red-headed Hulda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could just pretend that he was going out for a horseback ride that night and not come back . Morgan Hoon or somebody would fetch his clothes for him , or Hawk Bailiff would bring them over . He could fix it so he got the mail the next day and pretend that there was a letter from Ora asking him to come back . Grandma Nadeli would be better . Or he could wait until nobody was in the kitchen and twist the handle of the telephone to make four long and two short ( the Musser ring ) and pretend that he was having a conversation with Ora asking him to come back . Only that way the people who listened in would get next to what was happening . All the while he was thinking of these dodges , part of Lemuel 's mind was ashamed . He jabbed the fork into the hay and walked rapidly to the box-stall , where Joe was fixing a piece of harness . Lemuel talked fast . He kept finding himself acting guilty , as if quitting his job was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buckle he was forcing into place . When Lemuel finally said , So I 'd like to leave in a week or so if that 's satisfactory , ' Joe turned his face and eyes toward Lemuel . A deep and mellow sympathy seemed to flow from him . Why do n't you go tonight ? ' he said . I 'll get another man . ' When Lemuel wrapped his belongings in a roll and fastened them to his saddle , it occurred to him that he had not let Ora and Barbara know that he was leaving Mussers ' . Joe Musser gravely and silently handed him seventeen  | dollars . His wages were fifteen dollars a month . He had worked four days over . Mrs. Musser read Lemuel a lecture . You ca n't say , Lemuel , ' she said , that we have n't been good to you , and I do n't want to hear that you talk against us . You 're a boy , and a boy always has got the go in his pants , and that 's all there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll realize that a person ca n't just be trying things and giving them up all the time . When you put your handle to the plow , you 've got to stick to it . Sometime you 'll realize that we were good to you . ' Lemuel said , Yes 'm , ' and fled . His little mare beat the dusty roadside with a steady lope . It was about seven in the evening . At Hess 's place , a girl in a sunbonnet was turning the cows out of the barnyard into the lane . At Yinglings ' they were eating outdoors , at a table under a willow tree . At Speakers ' old Charles Speaker was sitting on the front porch cleaning his shotgun and two of the Speaker girls were pumping on the swing , going pretty high . Apple leaves brushed Lemuel 's face . Small bridges roared under the little mare 's hoofs . The Rebmans ' big black dog came out and ran alongside the horse making a fuss . Lemuel galloped past old Wilson Snader , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had two old plugs tied behind his sulky and a fiery colt between the shafts . Lemuel imagined the homecoming . Clyde would josh him . Well , ' he would say , here comes the hired man . Did you get it where the chicken got the a-x-e ? Or did you have to run away from Hulda Musser ? '  | Ora would smile , but he would n't say anything to make Lemuel feel bad . Barbara would be sympathetic . For some reason or other , Lemuel felt guilty . It seemed to him that he was not doing anything shameful , yet inside himself he felt a little ashamed . His face burned . To turn his thoughts away from their uncomfortable trend , he stood up in the saddle and sang . A cat , crouched behind a clump of milkweed beside the road , looked at him superciliously . When he saw Ora 's barn off in the distance , his heart swelled . He was deeply stirred inside as he turned the horse and galloped up the lane . Ora was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped pumping and came out to the driveway as Lemuel brought the horse to a stop . Well , ' said Ora , what are you , anyhow ? A mind-reader ? ' Why ? ' asked Lemuel . Well , for goodness ' sakes , I was just going to call you up and ask you if you would n't come home . Uncle Simon fell out of the haymow and broke his leg , and Clyde 's gone home . I 'm looking for a hired man . ' ' My ! ' said Lemuel . Then , too , we 've got a little surprise for you in the house . Right now we need a nursemaid the worst way ! ' Lemuel saw a twinkle in Ora 's eye . But he did n't get it until they reached the summer kitchen door and a sound made him stop , motionless . It was a baby crying ? the thin , gasping sound of a very new baby . Hey ! ' cried Lemuel , what 's going on here ? What the Sam Hill ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gray shawl over her head , came out and embraced him . It seemed  | to Lemuel that she had brought the perfumes of her own kitchen along with her , for he was sure he smelled boiling chicken and toasting cheese , just as he always did at Jacoby 's Corners . Hah-lo , hah-lo , ' she laughed , and she gave him a little push . Go once look . Go on ! It 's a surprise on you ! ' Lemuel walked through the sitting-room to the downstairs bedroom . When he saw Barbara on the bed , he also saw the bundle in a blue blanket . It was open at the top and showed a small red face , no bigger than a potato , and two red fists , no bigger than hickory nuts . The face and the fists were clenching and unclenching and the fists were batting erratically . There was a smile on Ora 's face big enough for ten faces , and there was a look of peace and beauty on Barbara 's that made Lemuel want to cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fist sideways and grinned with annoyance . Ach , Lemchen , ' Grandma Nadeli laughed , would you want to guess the surprises ? ' The baby wail had subsided from its climax of small fury . Lemuel could hardly take his eyes off his new cousin . It was a terribly homely baby , but very appealing . The little fists kept going at such a mad speed and the little face pinched and opened . What 's her name ? ' asked Lemuel . Ora bowed in a ceremonious gesture . Meet your namesake , ' he said . Lemuel , this is Lemuel . And he 's not a she . '  | C H A P T E R F O U R HAY-ROPE WITH Uncle Simon pretty much out of commission because of his broken leg , and the hired man away at a funeral in Pennsylvania , Clyde needed help with the clover hay at the homestead farm . So Ora and Lemuel volunteered . The hay was mown on Saturday and then dried in Sunday 's sun . There was no dew Sunday night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lemuel were out in Uncle Simon 's field by six-thirty . The loader , like a broad giraffe , stood at the gate of the field . They fastened it to the rear of the hay-wagon . At its base great wire hands clawed at the stubble , dragging the hay within reach of the teeth which pulled it upward . On the wagon , a thick mat of hay began to pour out of the loader . While Lemuel handled the team , Ora packed away the first of the hay at the back end of the rack . By the time the wagon was half loaded , the team had caught on to its work well enough to guide itself , and Lemuel was working with Ora at the loader 's mouth . They seized great mops of hay and dragged them forward . The wagon rocked under their feet . Unlike Joe Musser , Ora was a high loader . This meant that the load had to be built carefully or it would upset the wagon or slip from the rack . But it was n't hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big load up the bank into the barn . Ground shot like bullets from their feet .  | The barn-floor rumbled and the first load of hay was ready for the mow . Lemuel climbed down the little ladder that was the front standard of the hayrack . Clyde climbed up into the haymow . He was to mow the hay away , Aunt Jen to salt and tramp it . Lemuel 's job was to drive old Charley in the rope . Ora tended the harpoon . He drew it down to him by the slender check-rope . He sank it deep into the hay , well forward , and drew up the barbs . Then he stood clear . The strong inchrope ran by pulleys from the harpoon to the comb of the barn and off to one gable and then back down to the barn-floor and out to the whippletree . Go ahead , ' said Ora . Giddap , ' said Lemuel . Old Charley , experienced in this work , went slowly until he felt the rope tighten behind him . Then he leaned and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his toes . The rope groaned and the pulleys whimpered and sang . A great umbrella of hay rose sedately from the wagon , straight upward toward the shiny track in the comb of the barn . There was a strong click when the harpoon engaged the track . It coasted along horizontally , and the rope slackened and the whippletree behind Charley sagged toward the ground , threatening the horse 's heels . Lemuel seized it and bore backward to keep it up while Charley turned around and walked back toward the barn . There Charley swung around again , and Lemuel laid the whippletree down . At the gable-end of the mow the great mass of hay fell when Ora tripped the barbs of the harpoon . Clyde stood ready with a pitchfork and rolled the cargo toward a corner  | while it was still in the air . He always tried to catch it before it could become a dead weight , lying fiat . Then Aunt Jen scattered the coarse salt , and , giggling a little at this first excursion into barn activities for many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jovial , and shouted to each other . Roll her out smooth ! ' Ora yelled to Clyde . She 's got to come out of there this winter . ' Send ' em up bigger , ' Clyde answered . You ai n't keeping us busy . ' On the third harpoon load , midway of his run , Charley suddenly fell forward on his nose and the lines dragged Lemuel down . There was a terrible whining and cracking in the barn . The hay-rope had broken . Switching like a malevolent snake , it lashed through the mow , just missing Aunt Jen , and hit Clyde all along one side . He fell into the hay without making a sound . Lemuel got to his feet . Old Charley was all tangled up in the harness . Ora was sawing the lines of the bay horses . They were scared , and they were jerking the hay-wagon around . Clyde lay very still . Beside him , on the uneven surface of the hay , lay the rope which had struck him down . It was quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deadly lashing snake had all gone out of it . Ora had got to Clyde and quickly opened the boy 's sweatdrenched shirt , and put his ear over Clyde 's heart . He listened intently , his eyes screwed up tightly . Lemuel started to turn his eyes away . Ora said , in a shaky voice : I think he 's all right . His heart sounds kind of faint , but it 's still going . '  | Aunt Jen cried , How on earth can we get him down out of this haymow ? ' But Ora took the boy in his arms and leaped from the mow to the hay-wagon , taking all the force of the drop in his legs . Aunt Jen sent Lemuel running to the house after whiskey and ammonia . Ora had laid Clyde on some sacks in the barn doorway . Lemuel , very white around the mouth and feeling as if he were going to be sick at the stomach , stood and watched while Ora felt for broken bones . When they put the ammonia under Clyde 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of soundless moan came through his lips . As the whiskey trickled down Clyde 's throat , he opened his eyes and said in a feeble voice , I 'm all right . ' He opened his eyes again and smiled dimly at his mother . It was that same sleeping smile he had worn on a night of childhood sickness years before . Do n't worry , ' he said . Then he seemed to go to sleep again . That was what scared them . He kept waking up a little and then going to sleep again . When the doctor arrived , he listened and tapped . After a while he said to Ora : Go on and get in your hay , Orry . The boy will be all right , though he 'd better stay in bed a day or two . He 'll be sore for a while , but there 's nothing broken . ' Clyde was weak , though , and the first night he was a little feverish . He dreamed that he was pumping water endlessly into the tank into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First he would face one way and pump , then face the other way and use the other arm . In the morning Clyde remembered a particular day years before when he had kept on pumping like that . A fire was raging at a near-by farm , and his mother ran across the fields ,  | but she had told him to keep on pumping . So he kept at the dreary task ( it was always that ) , and made the two hundred circulations of the pump handle needed to fill the big trough . Somehow , that started Clyde to thinking back to many nearly forgotten scenes . He kept returning to them in his mind during the couple of days that he lay resting and relaxed on a couch they had pulled into the kitchen for him . Sometimes he hardly heard the voices of his mother and father and the hired man , Amri . During that time , one of the people that Clyde remembered most vividly was Old Anka . Anka lived in a little house , low and tiny and rambling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tar paper fastened with brads and big washers . The chimney was a long length of stovepipe held in place by wire guys . It would have been foolish to say that she lived alone . In the corner there was Hugo , the ' cello which had a black bow tied around its neck over the strings . On the top of the bureau was Gretel , the clock . Grosspapa , the stove , kept Anka warm , and boiled the tender knoepfli for her . Fresshans , the cat , rubbed against the thick stockings of her old legs . Outside were Wiesili , Mari , Maedel , and Riki , the hens , and Onkel Jakob , the rooster . And there came to her doorstep Aeini and Tchacni , the pigeons . Anka talked to all of them and listened for their answers . When Anka fed the pigeons , she murmured to them , Aeni is fatter as Tchaeni , but Tchaeni got pinker feet . ' Sometimes Anka talked also to Johann . He was her husband , the player of Hugo , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time since he died . She could tell when he was around , kind and gentle , the way he always was . The picture of Johann when he was a young man showed him in short chamois pants and an embroidered shirt , and it stood on an easel beside the bass fiddle . The photograph was violently tinted and it bulged outward . In it Johann was not holding Hugo , but a large beer mug . You could scarcely see the ceiling because so many things hung down . There were old cloth salt-sacks full of dry-herb leaves which crackled when you pinched them and gave off a curious medicinal smell . There were chains of onions and ears of corn . There were branches of oak with brittle leaves clinging to them , and sprigs of holly . There was a bundle of willow whips . On the floor was a turkey-red carpet which gave at every step because there was straw under it . The windows were hung with strips of red-and-white-checked stuff , which had once been tablecloths . Anka had a little boat which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canal . She propelled it by swishing a paddle around its stern . A wire from shore to shore , passing through two iron eyes on the gunwale , steered it . Clyde sat in the boat one day , and pretended that he was Huckleberry Finn , sailing down the Mississippi . One day ( the day on which Clyde , only five , was lost in sickness ) a girl had come running to the old woman crying out , Anka , Anka ! Come please , quick , quick ! The little Clyde is sick . ' It was Barbara Nadeli , aged ten . Anka laid the goose she was plucking down on the doorstep . Her hands flew up in horror . Ei , ei , ei ! ' she said . The little Clyde ! Ei , the day of my life ! '  | She wiped her hands on her apron , turned the clean side out , threw an old cape over her back , and was away on a run . Over her shoulder she spoke to Hugo , the ' cello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' What did you say ? ' asked the little girl . But when Anka explained about Hugo , she was not really surprised . Clyde lay white and quiet on the bed . His fever was high and when he opened his eyes they were full of pain and wonderment . Now and then he turned his head from one side to the other . His mother , who was not usually helpless , just stood beside him , her hands wrapped in her apron . Clydelie , son , ' she said . What can I do for you ? ' When Anka came in , everything was better . Everyone leaned on her . She hurried to the cupboard . She put water on the stove to heat . She got out the mustard . She mixed a potion of lemon and sweet spirits of nitre to take down the fever . She warmed the goose-grease . And in a little while , as they told him smilingly afterward , the sick child began to sprout little fountains on his forehead . In an hour he was sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go home . She stayed and made supper . Jennie Nadeli felt so much relieved that she was ready to cry . When Anka said something quaint , she laughed a little as if , perhaps , she would change to weeping in the middle of a smile . And Barbara , twisting a pigtail , stood in the doorway regarding Anka as if she were Charlemagne and Barbarossa both at the same time . Later , when Clyde began to cry , Anka went to him . My head aches , ' he said . Anka laid her hand upon his forehead . Beads of sweat came out on her face . Her arm  | began to pulse like the temple of a horse when it is eating . But soon Clyde could say , It is all gone , now . ' Then Anka had to go off by herself , in the little room where there was a bed . She waved her arm back and forth . She stroked it with her other hand . When she laid it down , it fluttered like a held pigeon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bluish-red that she returned to the kitchen . When Simon Nadeli came home , he went to the boy and his face was serious . He said , Anka , how much do we owe you ? ' Anka grew very red in the face . Ach , ' she said , do n't be foolish . I need nothing . ' Come and live with us , ' he said . Come . It is not good that you should live alone . It is not good that you should wait upon yourself in all small matters . Come , and let us keep you . ' No , ' said Anka , I must keep my house . ' Two days later she started for her little house beside the canal , but when she was a little way down the road a pigtailed girl caught up with her . She held out in her hand a little ten-cent locket which had turned green and lost three of its red jewels . I wish to give you this , ' Barbara said quickly . I do not want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The recording angel hears all stories , ' she said . You wish very much to keep it , and you give it to me because it is the nicest thing you have . But , so ! I take it . Thank you . Now , then , you keep it for me . Wear it for me . I am an old woman , and it would look funny on my wrinkled neck . To do me a favor , wear it for me . But , remember , it is my locket P  | She hugged the girl and gave her one sound spank and said , Go home now so the little Clyde will not be lonesome . ' She had become a comforting and slightly miraculous legend in the Nadeli household , and now , for a moment , Clyde felt sad because she and her little house were both gone . Goodness , the things he had wanted money for ! For a long time he had dreamed of a pair of skates with four runners , one at each corner , the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had wanted some name cards with fringe . His Aunt Emmy had some which filled him with great envy . The one he especially admired had two doves with ribbon in their bills and purple fringe , and a verse which said : The sea may rise And mountains fall ; But my love for thee Will live thru it all . That seemed very patrician . For a long time he particularly wanted a baseball glove and a dollar-and-a-quarter baseball . The nickel and the dime baseballs he had invariably got lopsided . Once they were wet they forever met the impact of the bat with a spongy thud . He wanted a dollar watch , an Ingersoll , and had pointed this out to his mother one day when he was drying the dishes for her . He made it plain that this was the uppermost of his desires and he spoke of it as a need rather than a luxury . He assured her and himself that it would be a very economical and sensible thing to have . Of course he also wanted fabulous things , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a camera . He figured  | and figured on how he could earn a dollar . At last he approached his father . He would sell him his old roan horse , Dan , who had a tail like a pump-handle , for one dollar . I ca n't use him , ' his father said . He 's too old . ' So that was that . Clyde had been promised a tool-chest for his eleventh birthday . But there had been ill luck all year . Hog cholera , and a good horse torn so badly on a barbed-wire fence that it had to be shot . His father said , Son , I 'm afraid we ca n't get that tool-box this year . ' Clyde nodded , and they went on working hard all day mending the fences . At the supper table they were all silent . Of a sudden Clyde 's mother rose and hurried out of the room . She was weeping . In the same instant the boy saw that there were tears , too , in the eyes of his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old steel traps in a woodshed . Amri told him they should be smoked in order to take away the human smell , and that they then should be baited with corn and set along a little watercourse . A peg should be driven and the traps fastened to it . Clyde , not thinking of money at all , did this for the fun of it . He caught skunk and muskrat , and Amri showed him how to skin them and salt the hides . And one day his father took the hides along to town and when he came back he handed his son sixty dollars and said , There . That 's your money from the hides . ' Clyde could n't think in terms of so fabulous an amount of money . Besides , it was such a good even sum he hated to break it . So , after much deliberation , he asked his father to put it in the bank . When his father came back with the bankbook he said ,  | And now , I 've got something else for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifle . Now come on out , ' his father said , and I 'll show you how to use this thing . ' Golly , mother , ' said Clyde with a sigh , it 's hot as blazes in here . Whee , wish I could have some ice-water . ' Well , we 're going to have ice cream tonight . And , you rascal , you do n't even have to turn the freezer ! Besides , who was it wanted to lie out in the hot kitchen ? ' All right , all right , ' said Clyde , do n't get tough . But I just wish I was out following that line of traps of mine right now . A farmer does n't have time to have fun in the summertime . ' ' Ho F cried Amri , calling in from the small milk porch , look at who 's getting out of the chores . What about poor me and all the cows I 've got to milk just on account of you ? What a life ! Wish I could just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about baseball all day long . ' Baseball , ' said Clyde . Phooie on that . It 's my traps I 'd like to look at . I 'd like to be up in that old Arctic right now . ' And , boy , he had had fun with his traps ! ... Clyde and the dog , Sport , were wholly alone in the middle of a great silent desert of snow . Under it , the hills that were gravel and the hills that were clay lost their individuality . They were merely parts of a white undulation . Clyde and his dog were out to look at the boy 's line of traps . Clyde had passed over the ridge that hid the road and the farmhouse along it . There was in sight only one hint of man 's  | habitation ? a farmhouse far off on a high hill , and it looked more like a farmhouse that a painter had put upon canvas than like a place in which human beings kept warm and ate their meals and worked out the drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rifle there was nothing about him to indicate the hunter . He wore felt boots into which were tucked the legs of his corduroy pants . He was wearing a sweater and two coats ( the outer one being his father 's ) and a knitted muffler around his neck , tied with a bow . His hands were in mittens connected by a tape which ran down the inside of the coat-sleeves . On his head was an old cap to the front of which clung the matted hair of cows he had milked . Even Sportie did not suggest hunting . He was a cow-dog ? a big bear of a dog , part shepherd , part collie , black with an orange fleck over each eye . He did not frolic . He plodded behind Clyde 's snowshoes , his small paws sinking into the snow . The home-made snowshoes left two trails , slightly zigzagged , in the snow . Clyde 's game-bag was a newspaper sack obtained from his city cousin , Jeff Landesman . In it were two muskrats and a rusty trap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Clyde was playing a drama of his own in his mind . He was about to discover the North Pole . The rifle was kept ready in case a polar bear should appear . He made himself so sure that this was likely to happen that he stopped awhile to cut a hole in his right mitten ? a hole through which he could put forth his trigger finger if the emergency rose too suddenly to permit the mitten to be removed . The old chestnut tree that had been struck by lightning four times was the North Pole . The boy was going to plant  | an imaginary flag upon it , and claim the land in the name of the United States . He decided , moreover , that he would make a sled out of saplings , using his pocket-knife as an implement , and hitch the dog to it . When he thought of this , he looked at the dog , and the dog looked wisely and slyly back to him , as if to say , You 're just making it all up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The snow was red with sundown when Clyde came back down the hill toward the barn . His father and Amri were getting ready for milking . The hired man paused in the business of pumping water for the cows to say , Well , Buckskin Pete , old trapper , any luck out on the trails today ? ' Yes , pard , ' answered Buckskin Pete , four walruses . ' And , after he had taken off his snowshoes , he laid the four muskrats out on the pump platform with a casual air , and went into the house to get some ginger cookies and a cup of hot milk before chores . Alas , Sport was lame now , and through Clyde 's own mistake with the hay-cutter . In the warm kitchen , with his back turned to the stove , Clyde allowed himself the luxury of a tear . Yet in some ways he had loved his first dog almost more than Sportie . The time had come when the dog , Jupiter , was so old that a skin kept growing over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although he was not a thoroughbred . Most of his blood was mastiff , but he had bloodhound and bulldog in him . In size he took after the prevailing strain . He was so tall that he could pick a loaf of bread off the middle of the table without leaving his four feet .  | Many stories were related about him . He made a round of the whole neighborhood every night . If any of the cows were out of their pastures , he raised an alarm . Chicken-stealing had practically ceased in the vicinity during his lifetime . His tail was like a club . One cold morning he stood in the kitchen . He was happy because of being allowed inside , and was wagging his bludgeon of a tail violently . It kept hitting the framework of a sewing machine . After half a dozen blows it began to bleed . He was not cruel . The time he caught a milk thief , he threw him to the ground and held him there by pushing his great muzzle into the thief 's belly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had bought the dog as a pup when Clyde was born . The boy and the dog were the same age . The dog had not been much of a playmate . His dignity would not allow him to draw the boy 's wagon in a rope harness . He preferred the society of men to the society of children . He objected to such chores as bringing home the cows . The boy whose companion he was supposed to be had to do that . In spite of his delinquencies , the family was very fond of him . Clyde was grateful for his attention , as if the dog were an adult . But now the half-blind dog ran into barbed-wire fences and fell over himself when he came to dead-furrows or ditches . Simon Nadeli took Jupiter to town to the old veterinary about it one more time . You 'd be doing the dog more of a favor if you killed him , ' he said . All he gets out of this is misery . Do n't bring him here to me any more . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the dog was to die that day . Nobody had told them . Their father had confided only in their mother . It was perhaps because of their father 's melancholy at the breakfast table that they knew . Barbara lay on her bed upstairs , with her face in the pillow . Clyde knelt at the couch in the parlor , weeping and sobbing . Now and then he raised his face and blew his breath over his lower lip up over his face , cooling it and raising the hair that hung over his forehead . Simon and the dog walked back in the lane . The farmer was carrying a rifle and a shovel . When he started his wife said , You could let somebody else do that for you . ' He shook his head . The old dog walked beside him , his head hanging because of age and weariness . The film had spread over his eyes sniff ' at the place where the heifer had hanged herself in the fence two years before . Perfunctorily and without enthusiasm he put his nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he walked beside Clyde 's father , bumping sideways into the farmer 's legs now and then . For all he knew they were going to dig postholes . The rifle always went along to the back end of the farm because of the woodchucks and crows . The old dog lay down with his jaw upon his forepaws while Simon dug . The dog watched without curiosity . Part of the time he kept only one eye open . After a while , the whole affair bored him , and he went to sleep .  | An owl , stepping along in the tree under which the hole was being dug , batted its eyes and said , Hu , hu , hu , hu , hoooooo ! ' The dog shook his great head without waking . When Simon got out of the hole , Jupiter woke , got to his feet , and stretched forward and backward . He planted his front feet at the edge of the hole and looked into it . The farmer had put a cartridge into the gun and was holding it against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The dog looked up at him and wagged his club of a tail . When Simon got back to the barn , he cleaned off the shovel and put it in its place , cleaned out the rifle and laid it on top of the cupboard . Then he took off his shoes and washed his hands . Going down into the pantry he took down a big jug from a high shelf . He drank deeply from the jug , put it back , wiped off his mouth , and lay down on the quilted top of the woodbox for two hours . There had been other beloved animals . When Simon Nadeli had first announced that he was buying a team of mules , there was much objection in the family . They had never used any draft animals excepting horses , and they thought there was something comical and disgraceful about a farmer 's having a pair of mules . People will laugh at us , ' Clyde said . His father smiled and said : No , they wo n't . Anyway , if they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing at us , they 're not laughing at somebody else . '  | Still Clyde had felt very bitter when the two mules were brought into the yard , led on halters behind a box-wagon . After his father had tried them out a few times , he said to his son : The mules will be your team . They 're gentle and they 've got sense . You 'll get along with them all right . ' Clyde 's team always had been Old Florry and Old Dan . But they were being relieved from heavy work , and were going to spend most of their time in pasture from then on . At first , he hated the mules , because they looked at him with sarcastic smiles , and the madder he got the more stubborn they were . One day his father talked to him about them . A mule , ' said his father , will treat you just as you treat it . Try being nice to them once . ' It was cultivating time . Clyde began petting the mules . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clump of grass and fed it to them . And they grew so fond of him that he had to guard himself when he curried them . They tried to show their affection by rubbing him against the wall of the stable . He would never forget the time that they had helped him to pull a stalled wagon out of the sink-hole in the road when his father and his cousin , Jeff , had been scratching their heads about what to do next . It still hurt a little to think of the time when he had been hiding in the haymow to listen to a conversation between his father and a stranger . There they are , ' Simon Nadeli said . There 's nothing wrong with either of them . Arthur is seven and Jason is six . They 're well broke , and for mules , as gentle as I 've ever seen . There they are , and my price for the two of them is three hundred and fifty dollars . ' The man felt the mules ' legs and looked into their mouths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put his ear against their ribs and listened . Clyde saw it all through the chinks in the haymow floor . For an instant he seized a pitchfork , and imagined he was on the verge of dashing down the ladder with this weapon to drive the stranger away . But then he lay down on a bed of hay and began crying . He liked those mules . They were his mules . Clyde had hated going for the cows when he was younger . There was perhaps no special reason why he had hated the chore , except that it came every day . There had been one day when he was making it harder by poking . He stopped on the near side of the lane 's knoll to lie down among the May-apple umbrellas . He paused next to throw at a cloud of yellow butterflies hanging over manure . Then he lay on his back to watch a gray hawk fooling around the wheatfield . And after that he counted the barbs on the five strands of wire between two posts . When he got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cows . They were on the far side of the woods . That made it worse than ever . He would have to cross the Canada thistle patch to get them , and he was barefooted . An idea took form in his head . It was just an idea , but it terrified him . He turned around and went back to the barn , walking fast . He stopped for a minute at the barn , trembling a little . Then he went to the house . His mother was cutting up vegetables for the soup . His father came in , carrying an armful of wood . Where are those cows ? ' he asked .  | Clyde told the lie . He said that he was afraid to go after the cows because Gypsies were camped in the woods . There were hundreds of them , he said . They had tents . Some of them , with rifles , were marching up and down . Clyde 's father neither frowned nor smiled . He went after the cows . His mother said , You 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought in the wood . At the supper table he could n't eat . He could n't swallow . All at once he began to cry . His mother and father looked at each other . His mother pressed her lips together and shook her head , as if she felt like crying , too . His father smiled in a friendly way . There were no Gypsies , ' the boy blurted out . That 's all right , ' his father said . After this you can carry Uncle Martin 's sword , and if there are any , you can chase them away . ' Clyde ate supper with Uncle Martin 's sword leaning against his chair . Lemuel got over to visit Clyde on the third morning after the accident , and he sat talking in the kitchen with his cousin and Amri . Clyde still did n't feel talkative himself , but he enjoyed listening to the others . Lemuel asked Amri whether he thought Clyde would live . Oh , sure , ' the hired man drawled . My curiosity could n't stand it if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to see whether he 's going to grow up to match his ears . ' Lemuel was summoned back to Uncle Simon 's by telephone the next morning , but it was n't because of Clyde . Old  | Dan had broken his halter in the night and had found his way through the colt stall into the feeding aisle . He had eaten many pecks of oats before Amri , at four in the morning , found him with his head buried in the oats bin . As Uncle Simon still used a crutch , somebody was needed to take turns with Amri in leading the foundered horse around the barn-lot . When Lemuel got there he saw Amri leading Old Dan in circles , and anybody could tell that the horse did n't feel much like walking . The hired man was talking to him . His voice did not sound as angry as the words . Come on , you old fool , ' said Amri . Come on ; you 'll walk whether you 're a mind to or not . You 're an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then you go and keep on eating ! ' Amri turned to Lemuel . Touch him a little behind with the buggy whip . ' Clyde , feeling considerably better , had come out on the back porch . That will do it , ' he called . But it did n't do any good . The horse just did n't want to walk . He barely dragged his feet , but they kept on leading him . Part of the time Amri sat on the edge of the horsetrough and cussed at Old Dan . You 're just walking , ' he told the horse , because you ca n't help yourself . You do n't know we 're saving your life . You think we 're working you , sick as you are , and you 're a-minding us because you ai n't got the intelligence to refuse . But you ai n't even got the intellect to quit eating when you 've got the bellyache . If it was good for you to eat more , do n't you think we 'd give it to you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longnecked  | green bottle . They put a twitch on Old Dan 's nose and shoved the bottle down his throat . He looked as if he hated it , and he kept curling his lip up afterward . About four o'clock Old Dan balked . Amri gave him a little whacking with the whip , but he just lay down . He looked at them once in reproach for his miserable day , and then he died . They were pretty gloomy . But after a while that lifted . Maybe it had something to do with the fact that Clyde seemed so much better . At supper Lemuel asked Clyde how Elsie Himmelreich was , and Aunt Jen smiled and said she had heard that Elsie was soon going visiting in Akron . My , my ! ' said Uncle Simon . I suppose after she meets some of those high-class city fellows , she wo n't want to come back at all . ' Clyde laughed with them . They told about the time when Clyde had been three and Uncle Perry had come visiting . Hi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called out . Little Clyde had pulled up his sailor dress and cried , pointing at his stomach , My belly ai n't blue , either . See here ! ' Never mind , ' said Clyde . He ate so much of the ham and noodles that Aunt Jen 's eyes bugged out .  | C H A P T E R F I V E CLYDE AND ELSIE CLYDE was riding over to make a call on Elsie Himmelreich . The occasion made him feel hollow inside , which was something that did n't happen very often . And his mouth was dry and there was a lump in his throat . As he dismounted , the Himmelreichs ' big black dog came bounding across the yard , raising a terrible fuss . Clyde felt a little annoyed . He was n't afraid of dogs , and he knew this one . But somehow he just wished it would n't make so much noise . All of a sudden his legs were water . Mrs. Himmelreich called around from the side of the house , where she had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , Clyde . Come on in . You should have been here for supper . We had potato dumplings . ' Clyde followed her through the house to the kitchen , where the two small brothers , Glen and Mitchell , were putting the dishes in the cupboard . Now , do n't you dare tell your ma what a mess this kitchen is , ' Mrs. Himmelreich said . Oh , say ! ' said Clyde , hers looks even worse . ' They went into the sitting-room and Mrs. Himmelreich motioned toward the McKinley rocker . Set right down , ' she said . Elsie ought to be down any minute now . Maybe I had n't ought to tell on her , but you 'd have died a-laughing to '  | see her streak when Tip started barking and she saw you a-riding up the lane . ' ' Ma ! ' It was the delicious voice of Elsie . She was shouting down the stairs . What you want , honey ? ' Come up here . ' Mrs. Himmelreich winked at Clyde . I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll catch it . You just set and read the Farmer . Pa 'll be back from the barn in no time . ' A minute later Mr. Himmelreich came in and he sat down in his customary chair under the big lamp . The two small boys had got into the room , and they were over in the corner making a lot of noise over the comic page . After Elsie came in , she and Clyde sat on the couch , and they looked at the postcards in her album . That one , ' said Elsie , is from Wilson Tharp that was our hired man when we lived at Stony Hill . ' Mr. Himmelreich had obviously been thinking of something to say . It was going to be something funny , because his eyes sparkled and their corners wrinkled . Well , so you come down here to snatch my girl away from me , eh , Clyde ? ' he asked . Clyde had a kind of convulsed feeling inside . Now , pa , ' said Mrs. Himmelreich , do n't start that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Could n't you wait a year or so longer ? ' he went on . I do n't see how I can afford a hired girl just yet , and Elsie is a lot of help around the house . ' ' Pa ! ' Both mother and daughter issued one last warning cry . But Mr. Himmelreich went on .  | Now and then , from what I hear , she even makes her own bed , and once a month or so she helps with the dishes . She 'll make some boy a good wife , but I was figuring on keeping her around yet for a while . ' Clyde got red , and for once he could n't think of anything to say . He was just about to put in , Aw , you 're just teasing , Mr. Himmelreich , ' but he never got to it . Elsie leaped from the couch and ran , sobbing , up the stairs . Now look what you 've done , ' Mrs. Himmelreich said . She followed Elsie . Hell , ' the farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swear-word , I did n't mean to make her bawl . I reckon I just about spoiled your visit . Gosh ! ' Oh , I knew you were just teasing , Mr. Himmelreich . ' The boy and the man sat saying nothing for a while . Come on out , ' the farmer finally said , and take a look at that mare I bought from Fredericks . ' They got back to the house to find Elsie and her mother sitting in the sitting-room . Elsie looked unforgivingly at her father . Honey , ' he said , I guess you got a no-good dad that spoils your fun . I ai n't much of a joker , I guess . ' She let him tease her into smiling . Then she put her arms around his neck and kissed him . That 's the best girl in the whole dang county , ' said Mr. Himmelreich over her shoulder to the caller . Something sang inside Clyde as his horse trotted along the dark , cool road on the way home . When he got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , threw up his cap , and yelled as loud as he could .  | C H A P T E R S I X THE NAMESAKE ORA had gone to Jacoby 's Corners . Amanda , the new hired girl , was doing the baby 's washing in the summer kitchen . Lemuel was set to watch the baby while Barbara napped . The baby lay in the old , carven cradle . It was asleep . Lemuel sat and looked at it closely . It did not look like a human being . It looked like a very old member of some lesser species . There was a certain elderly look of cunning on its face . All of a sudden its hands started to go and its mouth opened . This happened before it woke up . But the action woke it . The baby started to whimper , and after getting that important process started , it opened its eyes . There , there , there , ' said Lemuel , and rocked it a little . He was just a little panicky . The baby looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be wrong with it . Lemuel made up his mind that if the baby gave too much of a holler , he would help out with some kind of noise himself , so Barbara would be sure to wake up . But the baby did n't really bawl . It kept opening and closing its eyes and it poked out its mouth with the lips pointed , looking for all the world like a robin 's fledgling asking for worms . Lemuel touched its cheek with his finger , and the baby promptly opened its mouth wider still and squirmed all the harder inside its tight band .  | The next thing Lemuel did was to put his finger in the baby 's hand . The baby took hold . Say , ' said Lemuel , you 've got a real grip , I 'll tell the world . Say , you 're a strong fellow , you are . ' The baby got its whole body in motion with an action somewhat like a fish out of water . Lay still , ' said Lemuel . What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baby now , and he was over the feeling that he was in the presence of a stranger from another country . He got so familiar as to undo the bottom of the bundle and look at the baby 's feet . They were the most astonishing thing of all . They were so long ! They were long and narrow , and the baby , it seemed , used them just as it did its hands . As soon as the feet were free , they started batting around , and the whole foot clenched and unclenched . I guess I 'll have to call you Big-Foot , ' Lemuel said . I never saw such big feet on such a little fellow . ' The baby puckered up its whole face and tried to push it on one side of its skull . Well , do n't be sore , ' Lemuel said . I was just a-teasing you . ' All of a sudden the baby let out a terrible bawl . Lemuel went cold all over . Barbara 's light voice came from the living-room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lemuel sighed and said , Whew ! '  | C H A P T E R S E V E N THE FOURTH LOVE WHEN Lemuel first went to Ohio , he wrote to his mother every week because he had orders to do so . After a while he started asking other people who were writing to her to include a word from him . That took the place of a letter . He began skipping weeks . Once he did n't write for about a month . After he got a letter from his father calling him to order , he returned to the weekly schedule . But pretty soon he began making the intervals between letters longer , and the letters shorter . It was n't that his mother was out of his heart and mind . But it 's hard to think what to write to someone who is n't keeping up with what you 're doing . But when he fell in love with Amanda Stuver , he began writing to his mother once a week . Amanda was the hired girl , aged fourteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon after the boy returned from Joe Musser 's . Lemuel had already been in love three times . The first time was when he was seven and in the second grade at school . His sweetheart was a pie-faced little girl named Maggie Ham . Her hair was done in two pigtails , her nose turned up , she had freckles , and she talked funny English . In his later years , he could never remember why he had loved her . It was a love without reason . He demonstrated his affection by being especially rough with her . When the children were playing Pump-Pump-Pullaway and Lemuel was It , ' he seized Maggie by the arm and- slung her down  | instead of just tagging her . If nobody was looking , he was n't quite so mean . Maggie Ham gave Lemuel a silver badge which she had found back of a signboard and which Lemuel coveted . One day she did n't come to school . It turned out that her folks had moved out to somewhere in the Bronx . Lemuel 's next love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking through family albums , or the shoe-boxes in which were kept the photographs of persons not quite near enough for the family albums , always paused to exclaim over any picture of a girl with curls . It was an era in which beauty of feature and lovability of expression were nothing beside natural curly hair . A little girl might have a face like a chameleon 's and its lineaments might spell nothing at all but stupidity and brattiness , but if her hair hung down in slim cylinders , women threw up their hands and launched recklessly into ecstatic baby-talk . Men pride themselves that they choose their women , but they are wrong . Their sweethearts are chosen for them by the women of the next generation older . Though there was nothing fundamental in Lemuel which responded to curls , he had come to assume that it was an immutable law that curls are the full and final measure of beauty . Gladys Hanscom had curls . Moreover , they were yellow curls . They were as big and thick as bologna sausages , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their juncture with her scalp . Lemuel loved Gladys Hanscom for her yellow curls . She never knew it . Bold as he had been with Maggie Ham , the shyness which was to last him all his life had come upon him , and in his timidity he knew that a girl like Gladys  | Hanscom would only spurn a boy like Lemuel Hayden . So he loved her from afar . On balmy spring nights it was worst . Something inside him expanded until his ribs felt like bursting . He had often walked the mile to her house and sat hidden in the bushes of the vacant lot next door . In his fantasies , he rescued her from thugs and carried her out of burning buildings . She was partial to a boy named Bill , whom Lemuel and his friends did not like because he was a smart-aleck . Bill treated her like dirt . One time Gladys wrote him a note pleading with him to tell her why he hated her , and the note fell into the hands of the teacher , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her desk all recess , weeping . Lemuel could not play . He sat at his desk pretending to study , but his heart overflowed with agonized compassion . This second love occurred when he was just short of twelve years old , and it turned out very sadly . It did not end the evening that Gladys , standing on the steps of the schoolhouse , laughed when the smart-aleck Bill hit Lemuel on the back of the head with an egg . That made Lemuel feel very sad , but it did not make him feel bitter . The end came as the result of Lemuel 's habit of standing guard at Gladys 's home . He did n't know Gladys had ever seen him there . He went there because he was drawn by a powerful force . He humbly hoped that if there were a fire or a burglary , he would be there to save her . He would gladly have given his life for her . One day she wrote a note to the principal of the school accusing Lemuel of hanging around her house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . In a week or so , he regained his appetite for food .  | The third love was Barbara . Not until he was a grown man did he realize that he had been in love with her . While it was going on , he assumed that he just felt toward her as a boy feels toward a cousin whom he likes especially well . In some ways ( he thought when he was grown ) he loved Barbara better than any girl he ever loved . He was never as jealous about another girl as he was about Barbara . Yet he made friends with Ora and in the end wanted the marriage of Ora and Barbara in terms of a personal wish . It was as if he had kept his jealousy intact , but had made Ora a present of it . Then came the fourth love . Love comes to a fourteen-year-old boy the way spring comes to the world . He watches for it ; stays on the alert ; is vigilant for signs . Yet it comes without his seeing it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and established . Amanda Stuver 's people lived four miles away , and it was her first job away from home . ( In that time , parents sent their daughters out to work for their neighbors , because it was an accepted fact that a daughter can not learn at home how to be a housewife . ) Amanda was a shy girl . She had a characteristic which belongs to some shy girls : you might see her for weeks and never think of her looks at all ; then , all at once , you would think she was the most beautiful girl in the world . At first , Lemuel resented her being there . Then her shyness woke his sympathy . There is no stronger secret fellowship than that of the shy . All the while , he wondered whether he would fall in love with her . He watched himself for signs . And all at once he was in love .  | Lemuel was in the haymow . The big door at the gable-end was open to give the new hay plenty of air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pump , drawing a bucket of water . You 'd have thought he saw a rattlesnake coiled behind her , or a mad dog about to charge . He went down the ladder like a fireman . He tore around the corner of the feeding aisle leaning at an angle . He made the two hundred yards from the house to the barn in trackmeet time . He got to the cistern in time to carry the pail of water for her . Before he returned to the barn , he filled the reservoir . At the supper table , he suddenly sank into a sort of stupor . His mouth was open and he had a forkload of ham on the way . Midway between his mouth and the plate , the fork stopped and stayed suspended . Ora looked at Lemuel . Then he looked at Barbara . Then both of them looked at Lemuel . Ora 's eyes twinkled and he opened his mouth to say something jocular . Barbara shook her head . Ora took a drink of water . When he set the glass down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistol shot . He began eating very fast . After supper , Ora put the coffee-grinder on the table and set about the work of taking it apart and fixing what was wrong with it . Amanda and Barbara washed the dishes . Lemuel held the baby . The baby had hold of Lemuel 's nose and seemed happy . Lemuel followed Amanda with his eyes , which were open wider than usual and very mellow . A verse he had heard his mother read kept going back and forth in his head . Shy one , shy one , shy one of my heart ? '  | Tears came to Lemuel 's eyes . Love and tenderness turned his heart to water . He handed the baby over to Ora and went outside . When he got outside , he ran as hard as he could . Amanda Stuver came from a stern line . Her male ancestors were sober , diligent men who did not spare themselves or their families . Their word was law and they ruled their households down to the smallest detail . Her female ancestors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ docile or because they were vivacious . The unruliness of a vivacious woman is a challenge to a stern man . In their middle years these women lived in a stupor of drudgery . In their old age ( unless they died and were replaced by second wives or third wives ) they became either mild and placid , or gaunt and fierce . There were no trees around the Stuver house , though it had stood beyond a hundred years . The Stuver men did not approve of the comforts of shade or the fripperies of decoration . There was no flower garden . A bed of bleeding-hearts planted by one of the vivacious grandmothers in her first year of marriage kept on blooming beside the smokehouse , but the flowers were neither tended nor picked . The day before Amanda went to Ora 's house to be the hired girl she did n't know she was going . She did n't know what was going to happen to her , but she knew something was in the air , because now and again she caught her mother looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mind , she wondered whether she had unwittingly done a wrong and was to be punished for it . Patiently she waited to learn what was to  | befall . The docility which she had been taught was deep . She was not even very curious . At the supper table her father suddenly said , ' Alvah ! ' The oldest boy of those still at home put down his fork and tried to think what he had done wrong . He thought of several things before he realized that he had been eating with his elbow propped on the table . That was characteristic of the father . He called his children to order and left it up to them to figure out what had displeased him . If they could not think of it , and the error continued , he whipped them . After whipping them he told them what the wrong had been . Amanda could not forget a Sunday dinner that she had eaten at the table of her oldest brother , Homer , the married brother . Ed Hickenlooper , who was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousins , was asking Homer about Old Man Shoomey . Amanda remembered the conversation clearly . Is Old Shoomey still so mean and ornery ? ' Ed asked . They still call him the meanest man in three counties , ' said Odessa , Homer 's sprightly wife . Homer looked at her mildly and at Ed . He does act contrary , ' he said slowly . But I guess if a fellow knew everything that goes on in his head he would n't look as mean as he does from the outside . ' Nobody seemed much impressed . It was Homer 's way to take that attitude toward anybody who was being criticized . From the first sight on , everybody liked Homer . He was a big man and gave off a radiation of good-heartedness . You knew right off that he was a man of gentleness and justice .  | After dinner they had gone out and sat on the porch . Homer , his collarless Sunday shirt open at the throat , was on the settee with a baby on his lap , one youngster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat with him . He was always surrounded with children , his own or any others that happened to be around . In the midst of a talk about crops , a change came over Homer 's face . It went blank . Then it drew itself into the lines of a dawning horror . Gently Homer handed the baby to Amanda , and put aside the child at his knee . Looking far away and at something that was n't pleasant to see , he began going through his pockets with his fingers . His hands flew over his person like startled birds . He made little whimpering noises in his throat . Everyone fell cold and silent . Odessa Stuver went quickly to her husband 's side . She put her arm around him and talked quietly to him , almost whispering . It 's all right , Homer , ' she kept saying . You 're here at home . Nothing is lost . Homer ' ( insistently ) , it 's me talking to you . Dessie . Everything is all right , Homer . ' He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He brushed his eyes with the back of his hand and sat down again . The children watched with wide and worried eyes , wondering whether they ought to cry . When Homer Stuver had been ten years old he was sent on an errand . He went afoot to the village five miles away to bring back the shoes which had been left with the cobbler for mending . His father had given him a half-dollar with which to pay the cobbler . In that time , and that neighborhood , nobody wasted any pennies . Even at that , Joseph Stuver was known as a man who spoiled no child by sparing the rod .  | There is a separate emotion that goes with toss . It is a terrible emotion , both desperate and hopeless . It makes the hands and eyes search wildly where nothing can possibly be found , and it makes the heart say : If only I could go back five minutes . Five minutes ago this had not happened . ' Homer Stuver lost the half-dollar . A half-hour after he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tears streaking his dusty face and his eyes crazed . It took Jephthah ten minutes to find out what had happened. ? You ride in with me , ' the neighbor said . I 'll tell your father how it happened . ' Amanda had always known the earlier story , though not how she had first been told it . It was the memory of Homer as a grown man that stayed sadly in her heart . That night when young Alvah had corrected his table manners , Mr. Stuver turned to Amanda . Amanda , ' he said , tomorrow morning you will go to work at Ora Weiler 's . Be ready when I start to town . ' Yes , papa , ' said Amanda . The other children all showed their astonishment . Little Jacob , who always hung at her heels and had to sleep with her when he was sick or scared at night , began to screw up his face . Jacob ! ' said his father . The little boy tried , but his fear of his father only made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bed , ' his father said . Eat , the rest of you . ' Jacob went upstairs , undressed , and went sobbing to bed . After she had finished the dishes , Amanda lay beside him until he cried himself to sleep . Then she helped her mother put her clothes in a telescope bag .  | In the morning Amanda woke at three-thirty . This was a half-hour before the time of her father 's punctual wakening ; a half-hour before he called out , in sharp syllables , the names of his household , summoning them out of bed . Amanda lay awhile and watched the blue square of moonlight which was thrown out of kilter at the corner of the bureau . Her sister Sarah breathed evenly in the darkness beside her , blowing her breath through open lips . Amanda 's head felt uncomfortable . It was lying on the very edge of the pillow . Amanda raised her head and drew the pillow under it . It was wet . She had cried in her sleep . Suddenly the world seemed a strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around it seemed to be the one place of safety . She heard her mother stir . The white bulk of her mother 's nightgown moved through the moonbeam . Amanda lay still , her eyes closed . Her mother stroked her hair , lightly . A peace came into Amanda 's heart . She lay still , and her mother went back to her bed . She did not think that she was going to sleep , but the next moment she heard her father calling , ' Maw ! Alvah ! Carl ! Jason ! Sarah ! Esther ! Jacob ! ' He did not call Amanda 's name . Already , she was no longer a member of his family . Sarah was sitting on the edge of the bed , sound asleep . Every morning she sat up before she woke up . While Amanda helped her mother build a fire in the kitchen stove , they were alone together for a few minutes . Barbara is a good woman , ' Mrs. Stuver said . I would not have let him send you to a mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She minds me of Homer 's Dessie . Yes . Very fine . ' She talked as if she were reassuring herself .  | While Mrs. Stuver went out to help with the milking , Amanda , for the last time , fried the potatoes and the ham and broke the eggs into the mixing bowl ready to be put into the spider when her father started toward the house . Suddenly it occurred to her that she would no longer be under her father 's orders . Birds were singing exuberantly when Amanda and her father rode down the pike on the spring-seat of the Studebaker wagon . She could see Ora 's place off in the distance . Her father had not yet said anything . Now he began to speak . You are supposed to mind Ora and Barbara the same way you mind me , ' he said , without preamble . Their orders are my orders . You 'll be homesick the first couple of days . You are not supposed to come running to me . After a month , you can come some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to offer . Your pay is one hundred and fifty dollars a year . You do n't need to worry about that . I will collect it . You wo n't need any money . They 've got to provide for you . ' She said , Yes , papa . ' He was silent for a while . Then he gave her her diploma . You are an obedient girl , ' he said . It was his highest praise . There was the time that Lemuel was kicked by Topsy , the old black mare . There was the time his tonsils were removed , and the time he slipped getting over the barbed-wire fence and laid his leg open from ankle to groin . None of these things hurt him as much as a wound which left no mark upon him . The worst hurt he got in all his life was when another person got burnt .  | Amanda was making fried cakes . Lemuel was sitting in the kitchen ( he spent all his spare time there ) . Suddenly Amanda jumped back and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uttered a sudden little cry . What 's the matter , what 's the matter ? ' cried Lemuel , leaping to his feet . Some hot grease , ' said Amanda . It got on my hand . ' She put some butter on it . That did n't satisfy Lemuel . He went out into the garden and told Barbara . Barbara said butter was as good as anything . Lemuel fetched some wool fat from the barn . He remembered that the box said it was good for burns or galls on man or beast . When he was still a young man , Lemuel sat in a chair and heard a gruff doctor ( making his voice gruffer than ever ) tell him that he had only a few months to live . That was a sword through his heart . But when he reckoned up his life , he told himself that the worst pain he had ever felt was the agony of the burn on Amanda 's hand . It seemed arch criminality to Lemuel that the hand was not bandaged a foot in diameter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited at the woodpile . He knew that Amanda would come by , carrying the gallon can of milk that was to be put in the cooling trough overnight . Ordinarily , he would have hung around the house waiting to do that errand for her . Tonight , he cheated his chivalry in behalf of his stratagems . He pretended to be chopping wood , but he got little chopping done . When Amanda came past , he leaped to attention . He took hold of the other handle of the can and helped her carry it . At the cooling trough , he talked fast and stood still so she  | could not in politeness leave . At length he said : Do you have to go right in ? Why do n't you come in the orchard and let me show you the Jersey calf ? ' That calf , ' Lemuel was saying , as they sat down on a stack of square tile , is the dumbest calf I ever saw . I never saw such a dumb calf . He 's awful dumb . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . It came harder and harder . Finally he simply could n't . Tenderness and affection welled up and dammed his throat . There is something in deep fondness that makes a person want to put out his hands and touch the object of his love . Lemuel took Amanda 's hand . It 's the other hand , ' she said gently . The other hand ? ' Where the blister is , ' said Amanda . Amanda had little poems she said to stars and insects . A load of hay was always enough to bring a wish-rhyme from her . I see a load of hay ; make a wish and turn away , ' she would say . Then she would steadfastly keep from looking at the load of hay again , so she would n't spoil the chances of the wish . The first star of evening made her say : I see a star and the star sees me . I 'll see somebody tomorrow night that I do n't expect to see . ' In the evening when the bats prowled the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunbonnet and say : Bat , bat , come under my hat , and I will give you a piece of bacon fat . And when I bake I will give you a cake , if I am not mistaken . ' The idea was that this would charm the bat into flying into  | the hat . It did n't happen . That was just as well , because she would have been frightened if it had . If a little round winged bug spotted black and red walked on the window-pane , she said : Lady bug , lady bug , fly away home . Your nest is on fire and your children will burn . ' If a granddaddy-long-legs walked across her dress while she was sitting in the yard shelling peas , she seized him by a couple of his legs and said , Granddaddy-long-legs , tell me where my cows are , or I 'll kill you . ' Whether or not he pointed toward the pasture , she did not kill him . When a grasshopper humped up on her hand , she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasshopper obligingly spat out a drop of brownish fluid . When a chippy-bird flew from branch to branch above her , she said ; Chippy on the railroad , chippy on the fence , chippy get your hair cut : fifteen cents . ' When a measuring worm crawled upon her , she said : Measure fast , measure slow ; silk and satin head to toe . ' This was supposed to mean that she would get a new dress . But there were more measuring worms on the pig-hickory trees than there were silk and satin dresses in her closet . With her hands she used to illustrate a poem which delighted the baby . Fingers interlaced , she clasped her hands before her , knuckles up . This is the church , ' she said . Then she raised the index fingers to a peak . And this is the steeple . ' She turned her hands , still clasped , palm outward . Open the door , ' she said , and see six people . ' The six people were her other fingers . She knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh ? poems about chin-chopper and patty-cake and little pigs going to market . Her mild and gentle life was lived to the tune of such rhymes .  | Armstrong Creek spread out in the bottomlands beyond the sawmill , and there were two bridges right close together . The south bridge made a low and hollow rumble when anyone drove over it . The north bridge produced a higher , more clattery sound . You could hear the two bridges at Ora 's place , over a mile away . You could tell which way the rig was going , by noticing whether the low or the high rumble came first . And you could tell whether it was somebody in a wheeled vehicle , or somebody on horseback . This time it was somebody on horseback coming over from the east . Who would that be ? ' Ora wondered . It would n't be Glenn Nusbaum , because he 's helping the Gregorys thrash . Maybe one of the Ramseyer boys rode to town early this morning . Might have broke something on the binder . ' It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at breakfast when Clyde rode into the yard . Amanda turned from the stove , carrying a spider of fried potatoes . She was using her apron to protect her hands . And here 's Mandy , ' sang out Clyde . By ginger , Mandy , you 're getting better-looking every time I see you . I think I 'll have to give you a kiss . If you 're my sister 's hired girl , that makes us cousins , and cousins are allowed to kiss each other . ' It was plain that Amanda was embarrassed , but not unpleasantly embarrassed . As for Lemuel , he was overcome with horror and wrath . Oddly enough , that first wrath was not the anger of jealousy . It was the honest indignation which springs into the heart of the zealot when he sees irreverence toward his idol . It was the sort of feeling which starts holy wars .  | Clyde , it became increasingly evident , did not have the sacred feeling proper toward such a precious creature as Amanda . He treated her as if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After having chased her around the kitchen a couple of times , he abandoned the pursuit and told Ora : We 're going to thrash Monday , is what I came to tell you . And I 'm going to stay all day to help you slow-pokes catch up on your work . ' In mid-forenoon Amanda brought cheese and bread and thin wine to the field for their lunch . Mandy , ' said Clyde , have you caught yourself a feller yet ? You better look me over . I 'm first-class and going cheap . Thirty days ' free trial . Come here and sit on my lap and I 'll give you a demonstration of how I spoon . ' Mild , shy Amanda laughed lightly . Nobody home , ' she said . Why do n't you set your cap for Lemuel if you wo n't have me ? ' Clyde suggested . He 's a little slow on the trigger , but if you give him the right kind of encouragement , he might get so nervy that he 'd ask you to go along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightly again . Lemuel , sickened and furious , got up and walked away . Time to get back to work , ' he said , trying to growl . It would have been a good growl , only his voice broke in the middle of it . They were as far as the north corner of the field starting back when Clyde said to Lemuel , How 's chances for borrowing your buggy tomorrow night ? ' Sure , ' said Lemuel . His voice made it a question as well as an answer .  | I was a mind to take a ride over to Watts Station , ' Clyde explained . They 're a-having a lawn fete over there at the Methodist Church . ' Say , ' said Lemuel , that 'll be swell . ' Along in the middle of the afternoon , Lemuel said to Clyde , Say , I 'll certainly have my mouth set for a big dish of that ice cream over at Watts Station . ' Clyde looked kind of funny . Why do n't we take my horse instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what yours is . ' ' Well-uh , ' Clyde said , I-uh ... Well , the truth is , I did n't know you was going along with us . ' . Lemuel felt like a person who has just sat down on a chair that 's a foot lower than he thought it was . He began wondering . If Clyde was n't figuring on going with him , he must be taking somebody else . With us , ' he had said . That meant somebody else , sure enough . It could n't be Ora and Barbara , or they 'd be going with the team in the surrey . Lemuel tried his best to keep the dread thought from coming into his mind . But finally he had to face it . Maybe Clyde was going to take Amanda ! Great bitterness flooded the boy 's heart : bitterness at Clyde for trying to cut him out ; bitterness at himself for not finding out about the lawn fete and asking Amanda first ; bitterness at Amanda for going with Clyde . At milking time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Lemuel 's pail and then he heard it suddenly stop . There was a long silence . Ora got worried . He thought something had happened . He got up and went into the other stable to see .  | Lemuel was just sitting there , his head in the hollow of the Holstein cow 's flank . What 's wrong ? ' Ora asked . Lemuel jumped . Nothing , ' he said , and began to milk real fast . He got to the table at noon pretty late . The rest were very gay . He put stuff on his plate but he did n't eat it . He could not look at Amanda . He was afraid he was going to start bawling like a calf . What 's wrong with you , anyhow ? ' Ora asked . I guess maybe I do n't feel none too good , ' Lemuel said . But with Ora 's eyes on him , Lemuel added briskly , Well , I 've got to curry my horse . ' There was no special need for Lemuel to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it anyway . He went to the barn right away . With his left hand the boy wielded the flat brush which a strap held tight to his palm . With his right , he handled the black-handled comb , consisting of a square of metal from which rose perpendicular rows of teeth . He began at the mare 's head , and brushed out her mane until it was smooth and shining . Then he did her neck . She had a thick coat , and he had to bang the currycomb against the wall of the stable every few strokes to knock off the hair that came out . Now and then he took the hair from the brush by running the currycomb through it . Fanny , the horse , stood placidly . She enjoyed the process . She was munching a mouthful of hay , her head hung down into the manger , and she looked dreamily into space . As he worked , Lemuel began to practice magic . He did n't want it to be true that Clyde was taking Amanda to the lawn  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know it 's true . They 'll go , and I 'll stay at home . They would n't think of taking me along . ' He hoped this charm would succeed , somehow . ( Even to the extent of its not being true in the first place that Clyde was planning to take Amanda . ) He remembered that Clyde had had a great crush on Elsie Himmelreich at Christmas , and ' Ora 's ' had still been teasing him about Elsie this summer . Then he remembered , with a sinking sensation , that Elsie was paying a visit to some friends in Akron . He tried divination . If Fanny takes another bite of hay before I finish her neck , they 'll ask me to go , too . ' He gave the neck a great deal of extra time and attention , but Fanny did n't take another bite . Lemuel was so exasperated that he smacked her one with the currycomb and said , You stubborn old fool ! ' The young mare looked around with mild surprise , and took another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flanks . It was queer to run the currycomb over her sides where the ribs were close to the skin , because it seemed as if you would tear the skin , but of course you did n't . She had a ticklish spot where her flank joined her body , and when he curried over this she fidgeted and looked annoyed . Ripples of nervousness ran over her whole body . He left her legs until last , because they were the hardest . She did n't like to have him scrape them , and she tried to lift them out of his way . He called her an old rip ; then , in a way , he apologized. : Doggone it , ' Lemuel said , if you would n't heist around that way a fellow would n't get so mad at you . ' Clyde came into the stable .  | Do me a favor , ' he said . Come on along tonight . ' I do n't want to , ' said Lemuel . If you do n't come , ' Clyde said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go unless you do . ' His face shining like the sun , Lemuel put his currying tools away . Then he hurried out of the barn . The village of Watts Station , sitting in its little valley like a nesting hen , looked pretty nice on the night of the Methodist lawn fete . The single street was lined with rigs . Clyde drove in at Werkshagen 's place . The family was gone , but Clyde made himself at home and put the horse in the barn . They walked along a street lifted out of the farm country of fairyland , Lemuel obsessed with Amanda , Amanda demure in a white dress , and Clyde leaving a wake of familiar wise-cracks behind . The fete overflowed onto the Presbyterian lawn . The church grounds were lighted by Japanese lanterns and filled with long tables , among which moved the people of the neighborhood , most of whom were strangers to the visitors from Ora 's . They were of all ages . The men , were dressed all the way from Sunday best to aged overalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women had fussed a little more . Each of them had dressed up , if only by putting on a fresh apron . The smaller children were underfoot and everywhere . Off in the shadows , by the buggy sheds , the young men gathered in self-conscious groups , slashing themselves on the legs with their buggy whips and asking each other cryptic questions . The young women hurried to associate themselves with the food , because they knew instinctively that youth plus beauty  | plus gastronomic satisfaction add up to the infallible recipe for catching a fellow . Those who had made fudge or seafoam hovered near it so they could admit the responsibility when the occasion arose . Only the younger children had begun to eat . The demure ones sat at the tables , digging their ice cream into the shapes of improbable buildings . The rowdy ones ate theirs on the run . Some of them thought so much more of mischief than they did of ice cream that they sacrificed little chunks of it to throw at each other . The older people seemed inclined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been glad to get started , but nobody seemed to want to make the first move . The Reverend Mr. Welt , pastor of the jubilating flock , moved through the grounds like an archangel of benignity . He patted the good boys and girls on the head ; he chid the noisy ones indulgently . When he talked to the adults , every other word was Sister ' or Brother . ' Jovially , he took a turn at dishing out the ice cream . He had a strong wrist and soon mastered the art of taking a wigwam-shaped chunk out of the freezer with the scoop provided by Diehm , the dairyman . Amanda left the two boys and joined a group of girls who were giggling under a Japanese lantern . While Lemuel stood near-by , not listening but pretending to , Clyde railed at a couple of the young men among the buggies . All evening long Lemuel managed to see where Amanda was .  | C H A P T E R E I G H T LONESOME DAY WHEN he first woke up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be alone . Instead of walking to the barn with Ora , he dressed quickly and went out ahead of everyone . He picked his work apart from all of them , and at the breakfast table he said little and ate fast . Barbara , without knowing this mood , understood it . She noticed that Lemuel spoke to her and to the others as if they were strangers ? politely and distantly . Ora was going to help with hauling in the oats at Uncle Valentine 's farm , and Lemuel had planned to go along . But Barbara intervened . Can you spare Lemuel ? ' she asked her husband . I need him to help me today . ' When both Ora and Amanda were out of earshot , his cousin gave Lemuel a lunch in a tin pail . She said : You 've been working real hard . You deserve a holiday . Go and take a walk somewhere if you want to . ' The boy started out in the direction of the wood-lot . There was a great unrest inside him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toy balloon , and someone had blown it up with a particularly volatile gas . Phrases were passing through his head . Some of them he said aloud , over and over , because the words tasted sweet to him . Simple words suddenly took on a strange , mysterious  | beauty . Such an ordinary pair of words as The Sea ' became full of majestic poetry to him . At Ora 's there were two orchards , and Lemuel passed through both of them on his way to the wood-lot . When he had been younger he had sometimes pretended that he was paying calls to the trees in his yard at home . Now he thought of all the trees as he went past . The orchard which lay along the lane from the house to the road was called The Old Orchard . ' The trees were incredibly gnarled . There were Baldwins , Winesaps , Greasy Pippins , and July apples in it . There were also two trees which bore very large , juicy apples that broke open when they fell to the ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Lemuel liked best . It was a fat , fair maple and stood off by itself . The ground rose from three sides to a sort of knoll , and the maple stood at the crest . Whenever men worked in the field , they ate their lunches under this tree , and often when company came on Sunday everyone would walk out there and sit in the shade . One could see a distance of fifteen miles from the knoll . Ora had a powerful spyglass , which was often taken to the tree . But Lemuel kept on through the cornfield . He could see the Stroh children across the road and he did not want to talk to anyone . Along the far edge of the cornfield was Ora 's row of poplars standing like plumes . Their leaves were always in motion . On a windy day , Lemuel liked to lie on a slope near them and watch white clouds come over them . In The New Orchard ' were younger trees . There was one which even Amanda could climb . This was called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given them the sapling . Another tree held fast to a scythe . Once long before someone had hung the scythe over the limb and it had stayed there so long that the wood had grown about it . In this orchard was the tree which had a limb that turned horizontal midway , and from it Lemuel had hung an impromptu swing . It was not high and not overly satisfactory , but it was secluded . This day Lemuel went to the swing and sat in it . But he did not feel like swinging . He went down to the ancient willow beside the stream . This tree sent off many shoots . Other days Lemuel had peeled many of these , because the wood under the bark was so white and smooth . But he kept on into the wood-lot until he reached the chestnut tree which stood by itself . The cows never gathered under this tree . Time after time it had been struck by lightning . Remembering this tree , Lemuel was always puzzled when people said , Lightning never strikes twice in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trunk of the tree . Soon he saw a piney-squirrel run along the branch of another tree , and he made out a great owl he had not noticed before . A snake wriggled past , only a few feet away . Lemuel 's flesh crept , but he sat still . Far off he heard a cowbell clank . It was a sound that , for some reason , usually made him feel homesick and as if he were going to cry . But this day the sadness was like a memory of something long ago . Lemuel composed a poem and it was about death . In his own mind he was like Dante , standing with a dark cloak about his shoulders , intimate with the Dark Stranger . This poem he did not plan to set down on paper , and he never did , but he remembered it all his life .  | ( When he was grown and knew something of the science of composition , Lemuel could tell that that was not a good poem , but full of imperfections which would ruin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich and sweet when he said them over to himself , because he tasted them with the tongue that tasted them first . ) It was strange that his first poem should have been about death , for he , in his practical life , shunned contact with it . He hated going to funerals and his relatives were to think it strange that he hated so much to attend these rituals , even when they concerned an uncle or aunt . Suddenly from his dark and shady place , Lemuel saw a young fox appear . He was standing alert and tense on a rock a hundred yards away , and he was silhouetted against the brilliant sunlight at the edge of the thicket . Lemuel held his breath , though he knew that he was as undiscoverable as in his earlier boyhood when he had had in his possession an imaginary liquid called Invisibleer . ' It had made him invisible to imaginary Indians , and it had served to get him out of many tight places . It was late afternoon when Lemuel started back to the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood in the cornfield he saw a man standing in a queer position at the edge of Ora 's land . It was a dark , stocky man , short and powerful , like the picture of a privateer 's bo'sun . He stood with his legs apart as if he were wrestling , and his face was turned upward . Lemuel went up to him . The man looked at the boy for a minute or two , and the two understood each other . This place , ' said the man , waving his arm to show that he meant the whole country around , this is a fine place . '  | Lemuel nodded . The man 's voice was rich and deep and as mighty as a note drawn from a bass viol . This is my home , ' the man said . These are my people . I wish I were their king , so I could do things for them . ' His voice was full of his love for the world . He turned to his listener and spoke gruffly . Go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be getting ideas in your head . ' As Lemuel went along the orchard by the roadside the crows were making a fuss over the top of a blasted pine . The frogs had started singing . A long way off the dogs howled . In his mind he said a return greeting to the three enormous hickory trees in the yard . These were pig-hickories ' and had very small and bitter nuts , not edible . Sometimes nests of caterpillars appeared on the limbs , and then Ora would take a piece of cloth , soak it in coal oil , and bind it to the end of a long pole . He ignited this and , using it as a torch , burned down the nests . And Lemuel looked in friendship toward the maple tree in the corner that had purplish leaves . Ora had only planted it a few years before . It grew very swiftly . And at the garden gate as he came closer to the kitchen , he nodded to the wildcherry tree which bore little bitter cherries that were mostly seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house he saw Barbara coming out into the yard to throw a pan of water on the grass . She waved to him casually . As if she hardly expected an answer she asked , Did you have a nice day ? ' The boy nodded . He felt more tired than if he had worked hard all day . That night Lemuel slept without dreaming , achieving the total inanimation which is the true sleep . And the next day  | he was especially friendly toward everybody and everything . On another day about a week later , when Lemuel was merely feeling lazy , it occurred to him that he could get out of work by pretending that the lonely fit was on him . But he would not do it .  | C H A P T E R N I N E ISPAHAN IS FAR GRANDMA NADELI said that the first thing you knew the summer would be all , and Lemuel would n't have been with her and Grandpa at Jacoby 's Corners . The boy had n't yet seen Pridie , his dog that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . Besides , the Nadelis were going to attend the Vanleiten family reunion , and Grandma thought that Lemuel would like that . Grandma had another reason for wishing that Lemuel , who had somehow grown into the family over at Ora 's , would pay a real visit to his grandparents . Grandpa Nadeli had not been able to go along on the short calls she had made at Ora 's and Simon 's that summer . The old man was failing . He stayed home most of the time , and so Grandma herself stayed more . She no longer liked to depend on the helpfulness of Mrs. Snell or other neighbors . So Lemuel stayed a week , in the early part of August , and he wrote his second poem , which was waggish , and he was very content , and he thought twice as much about Amanda Stuver as he had at Ora 's . And , as there was n't much work to do , he spent a good deal of his time adventuring alone . Grandma Nadeli got one of the surprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day and saw that it really was Lemuel out there in the back yard talking  | to the dog Pridie . He was asking what appeared to be a rhetorical question : Is it anybody 's business if a lady has a beau ? ' No , ' Grandma called , it ai n't nobody 's business ! ' Oh , Grandma ? land sakes ! ' said Lemuel . I did n't mean that that way , it 's just my poem . ' Your poem ! Ach , Barnhart , did you hear that ? Our small man has written a poem , about a lady 's business . ' The old man , very nearly asleep where he sat in the sun on the side porch , started up in his wheel-chair . What 's that , what 's that ? ' he cried . He had been dreaming of his old friend Isaac Yockey , the free-thinker , and the way he had named all of his boys after trees . Eight or nine boys , and they were called Oak , Hickory , Ash , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juniper , he remembered , was the one that always wanted to be alone , so that when the old man died and the whole clique and caboodle of them got Oregon fever and went West , he stayed behind in the old homestead . He never let a woman into that old Italian villa ' house from the time his mother moved out with the rest of the boys . What 's that ? Our little man 's a joker ! And now , is he a poet , too ? ' Better listen . Go ahead , Lemuel , say the whole thing . If Pridie can listen , so can we . ' Oh , shucks , ' said Lemuel with due hesitation . Well , I suppose you 'd pester me if I did n't say it right off ? ' Of course we would . ' said Grandpa , we would n't give you a second 's peace . ' Well , ' said Lemuel , and he recited the poem very fast :  | QUERIES Is it anybody 's business If a gentleman should choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse ? Or , to speak a little plainer , That the meaning all may know , Is it anybody 's business If a lady has a beau ? Is it anybody 's business ' But the lady 's , if her beau Rides out with other ladies And does n't let her know ? Is it anybody 's business But the gentleman 's if she Accepts another escort Where he does n't chance to be ? If a person 's on a sidewalk , Whether great or whether small , Is it anybody 's business Where that person means to call ? Or if you see a person As he 's calling anywhere , Is it any of your business What his business may be there ? The substance of our query Simply stated would be this : Is it anybody 's business What another 's business is ? If it is , or if it is n't We would really like to know , For we 're certain if it is n't There are some who make it so . ' Na , na , na , ' said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think of that ? ' Her voice , from habit ,  | sounded a little the way it did when she was goading the old man on to say that Tolstoy was a great writer whom she did n't appreciate . The old man looked at him with a glistening eye . Ha ! ' he cried , why would I be surprised ? He speaks it well , yes . This is because his grandfather , who now listens to him , preached and read in the church . Anyone can see that his grandfather was a speaker . ' He chuckled and wiped his forehead . But slower , my small man . Do n't be in a hurry . ' H'mmm , ' said Grandma to Lemuel . It is just in time . You will speak this at the reunion tomorrow , wo n't you ? Grandpa will help you practice if you need it . Everybody will like it so well . ' Oh , no , no , ' said Lemuel . Oh , no . ' But after a while he reconsidered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if they took it for granted that the new talent muse not be buried . Perhaps Amanda might like the poem , too . He did n't want to show it to her , of course . Maybe somebody who went to the reunion would mention it . The Vanleiten family reunion was held at the home of Norris Snook , two miles south and one-half mile east of Becker 's Crossing . It was a picnic reunion . There are two kinds of picnic reunions . In one kind , little groups eat together here and there out of their own baskets . In the other kind , everybody contributes to and eats from a general table . This family reunion was of the latter kind . Grandma Nadeli was a cousin to the Gret Vanleiten tribe . That was why she wanted to go , though the Nadeli family would n't be much represented . Lemuel carried her  | basket containing a great wedge of cheese , a boiled chicken , a wooden bucket of potato salad , and two dozen bananas . Grandma Nadeli was practically the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reunion is divided into four parts . In the first part , people visit with each other . In the second part , they eat . After eating , they have a program . That is the third part . The fourth part is just like the first part . The two visiting parts were rather tedious to Lemuel . None of the children got well enough acquainted to organize games . They hung about their fathers , listening to the adults asking mild questions and giving mild answers . Grandma Nadeli explained afterward to Lemuel that when he was a grown man he , too , would take satisfaction in just being near the people with whom he had been young . The dinner was a great success . A fat and jolly preacher asked the blessing . Then the dishes began to travel . You had to eat when you got the chance . Most of the time you were passing things . There was a certain element of suspense , too . The succulent fried chicken that went down the other side ? would that last back the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sparingly of the potato salad , the baked beans , and the cold macaroni . They nibbled a little at the chicken . But they saved their capacities for the desserts . After the lunch , the program got under way promptly . The preacher got up and made a speech showing that he was a Vanleiten . He traced his ancestry back to Adam Vanleiten , who lived in the Garden of Eden . Next an energetic old lady thumped the piano vigorously and sang a great many stanzas of a Civil War ballad .  | Lemuel was next and somehow , perhaps because they were all strangers , he did not find it as hard as he expected to recite his poem . Maybe because it was so much shorter than the old lady 's song that everybody was relieved ! They listened attentively , and they applauded very hard when he finished . Following Lemuel , the beau of one of the Vanleiten girls sang a popular song entitled Put Your Arms Around Me , Honey , Hold Me Tight . ' This was considered somewhat frivolous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed . Officers were elected for the next year . Horace Vanleiten invited the reunion and his bid was accepted . The program ended with the singing of Blest Be the Tie That Binds , ' with all the elderly ladies breaking their brittle sopranos on kindred minds . ' During the visiting afterward , several people told Grandma Nadeli that Lemuel was as fine a boy speaker as they had ever heard in their lives . It was a year since Henry Justice had been out of the penitentiary , and the chicken-stealing had started again . The farms around Jacoby 's Corners had organized to catch them at it . ' Ed Whitsamen had said over at the general store one day that it sounded to him as if the Minerot boys were with Hen . They were sardonic thieves . Driving some stolen horse ( usually an old one kept for a family pet rather than a young work animal ) they went from place to place , stealing a few chickens here and a ham there , and whatever took their fancy . They took these to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big stove , and held a feast . After writing nasty stuff on the blackboards , they knocked over a few desks and went away .  | Seeing lights over at the Snells ' , the next neighbors , in the middle of the night , and fearing someone was sick , Grandma Nadeli went over to see . As it was too hot for Lemuel to sleep in his tent-room , he was sleeping on Grandpa 's sofa in the kitchen . So he was immediately aroused and curious . Though Grandma urged him to go back to sleep , he could n't . After she left he put on his clothes , just to be ready in case of anything where he might be needed . Grandma Nadeli came back in a few minutes . She said : Well , the Missis is fixing to be just as worried as if she really was sick ! She 's so worried about her man getting out his shotgun to go after those chicken thieves she looks like she 's going to get took bad . So I 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm good with a rifle , ' said Lemuel . He was out in the middle of the floor sighting along the rifle modeled on Bess Brisenstine 's , which Ora 's had given him . He ran and looked out the window where Mr. Snell was presently visible running out to join the pair of men with horses who had aroused him . Grandma said : It was them , all right . The Beichler brothers said they came and stole the Sherbondys ' old mare and then some of their own chickens . They watched them do it , and just afterward came over to get Clem . ' Lemuel looked as if he wanted to cry for being left out . I bet it is n't half a mile to the old school , Grandma , ' he said . She laughed in her hearty , decisive way . Ach , you wish you were there , too , do n't you ? ' He gulped , and said , Yes . ' Well , go ahead , young one . Be careful . ' Shivering with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the deserted churchyard and fields over toward the school , carrying the single-shot .22 rifle . He walked from hillock to hillock , keeping out of sight from the schoolhouse . There was a horse and buggy in front of it . Firelight flickered on its windows . When a hand descended on his shoulder , the boy went cold . Then he saw that it was Mercury Yoder , the farm hand at Beichler 's place . Keep quiet , now , ' Mercury said . In the dark , the farmers gathered around the schoolhouse . Lemuel saw them bob up here and there , dark shadows in the moonlight . Then he saw a man walk up to the door and kick on it . The door was flung open and he saw that the man was his Uncle Valentine . Come out , ' said Uncle Valentine in his usual dry voice ; and keep your hands up . ' Hen Justice and the Minerot boys came on out , with their hands over their heads . Lemuel got acquainted with Ed Whitsamen when he walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was a large man , and with the largest beard that Lemuel had ever seen , said that he was a deist , but the pious called him an atheist . He was a curious man and at first Lemuel was a little afraid of him . He did n't talk much to most people , and when he did he had a kind of mean way of talking . He was the kind of man who would come into the store while a man was telling a story in which he figured well , and Ed would have a sort of a sarcastic look on his face . The other man would keep right on talking just to show that he was n't going to hush up just because Ed Whitsamen was around . Then he 'd start talking bigger than ever , and begin to feel sheepish , and talk bigger yet , and start getting red in the face .  | About that time Ed would get in his say . How old was you before you found out you would n't never amount to nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather be the way you are , or amount to something ? ' One time he had got a pretty big surprise , the way Ora told Lemuel . There was a bunch of surveyors came through , shooting the curves out of the state road . They were great for swimming , and every night they 'd be hollering and spluttering over in Robinson 's pond . Ed walked over there and watched them awhile and finally said , How long do you fellows think it will be before there 's a law against poisoning the fish ? ' Well , they threw him bodily into the pond , and the next day he was wheezing and heaving like an old horse . He came near enough dying that the Methodists said that now , at last , Ed would see the light . But not Ed . When he was worst of all and the doctor was trying to make him easy , thinking himself that it was probably the end , Ed gasped at him : Ai n't you glad nobody knows nothing about medicine except the doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him up . Ed took to Lemuel for some reason , although sometimes he made him a little uncomfortable by something he would say about another person . He told Lemuel stories , like about the time that Charley Leuthold , the Kerriston hardware-store man and Buick salesman , put one over on Colonel Josiah Duck , the auctioneer . Auctioneers are pretty hard to beat , or so they think , ' Ed  | Whitsamen pointed out . And Colonel Duck is sharp , I 'll allow . But Charley himself is a powerful quick man in a pickle . Sometimes I think he gets himself in the soup just to see how smooth he can wiggle out . When the Colonel was in town one day , ' Ed went on , Charley said to him , " Josiah , it often wonders me how comes a fellow that travels around as much as you do still hangs on to the old horse and buggy . " " Well , sir , " said Colonel Duck , " you know where I live . I do n't know why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to settle on , but he did . And I do n't think the automobile is made that will take me up that slant . " " I 've got one here that will do it , " said Charley . " If she does , " said the Colonel , " it 's a sale . " Well , halfway up that hill Charley could see easy enough that his go-devil was n't going to get to the top . She was fretting and straining like a foundered cow . So Charley just stopped the car . " Now look here , Josiah , " he said . " I 'm just going to show you how powerful this automobile is . I 'm going up backwards . " So he turned around , and put her in reverse , and he backed up the hill with the Colonel 's mouth hanging wide open . The Colonel was a sharp man but he did n't know anything about cars , and he did n't have a notion that the machine had an easier pull going backwards . ' So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horsehide coat from his first train ride out from New York . Oh , ' said Ed , for three years Josh used to go halfway up the hill , turn around , go into reverse , and back up the rest of the way .... '  | ' Uh-huh , ' said Lemuel . Then he traded her in on an Apperson jack-rabbit . ' Ed Whitsamen started to laugh after telling Lemuel about the way Colonel Duck got outsmarted in a car deal . So Lemuel waited , smiling in anticipation of whatever would come next . But the funniest man I ever did see for a car , ' said Ed , was old Finnyfrock . You probably saw yourself what happened to the one he got stuck with . In fact it was another one of Charley 's bright ideas . ' Lemuel looked puzzled . Mean to say you never went past that twenty-acre field where Israel Finnyfrock used to have his farm , just this side of Kerriston ? In the summer there 's a big clump of grass and sunflowers . In the winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you can see what 's left of an old automobile . There ai n't no doors to the back seat , and the gear-shift is on the outside . The stalks of the sunflowers have come up through the transmission and the motor . Well , Israel Finnyfrock bought that car in 1907 , the first car bought in the county . Charley just told him that there was nothing to handling a car . " If you ever run a gasoline engine , " he said , " you know that part of it , and if you ever drove a cultivator , you know how to handle the levers . That 's about all there is to it . " Ho , I remember hearing how Finny 's wife Florry took on when she heard of it . He just let Charley drive him up with the thing one day , and she said what with eggs twenty cents a dozen did n't they have troubles enough without him going and getting one of them go-devils before any of the neighbors ?  | She said she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the way it happened , she did n't . ' My land ! ' said Lemuel , not once ? ' No , sir . Iz could n't rest until he took the thing out for a trip , but his woman would n't go along . But she said as long as he was bound to go he might as well take some sunflower seeds along to Talleys ' . So he started to . I guess he sat there in that front seat a long time with the motor running before he got up his nerve to put it in gear . It gave such a jump that it threw all his nerves out of kilter . Anyhow , it went tearing down the lane , with Izzy yelling " Whoa , whoa , whoa there ! " He did n't have enough sense to turn with the lane , so he went right on out into a wheat-stubble field . All the time he was shouting and yelling so that they heard him a mile away , and Florry was on her back in the yard flopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Iz could n't remember but one thing and that was that the hand brake was called an emergency brake , and he figured that was an emergency . So he threw it on , and what with the bad ground and all he finally managed to kill the engine . He had told Florry , kind of teasing her , when she said she was afraid of the thing , that if he was n't smart enough to run it , he 'd hire a " chiffonier " to drive them , but that was n't the way it worked . No , Israel Finnyfrock stepped out of that automobile and left it there . Next summer he mowed around it . The sunflower seeds got into the ground and came up , and it looks right pretty to see them in the summer , but every time Izzy sees them he cusses . ' Chiffonier ? ' asked Lemuel . Do you mean  | Oh , that 's right , ' said Ed . You do n't know Finny , so you would n't know what kind of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English language . Well , let me tell you , he 's a man of determination . He stands for no nonsense , like he gets impatient with the way foreigners talk . Finny 'll say , " Even if they do come from the old country , that 's no excuse for talking as if they had a mouthful of mush . " He 's responsible for the fact that the Alpenhoch family is now called Applehope . They are simple people , and they just accepted the idea that one of the terms of life in this new country is that their name should be changed in that peculiar way . It takes lots more than that to hold Finny down , ' Ed continued , when he saw Lemuel 's surprised face . Why , he did n't like the way most of the folks pronounced the Methodist preacher 's name . It was Wingerter , but they all called him " Mr. Wingutter . " But Finny found the exact word which he felt was being abused . To him the preacher is " Mr. Vinegar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kerriston a while back Iz just decided that Bijou was a Frenchified way of saying " By Joe . " As for the other theatre , the Cameo , Iz called it " Came-o " a few times and then I guess he just thought of his favorite cigar . From then on the name of that theatre was " Cremo . " Changes come easy in a language , ' went on Ed , but you can see how people like Finny help it along , and sometimes there is n't a speck of sense to what happens . Did you know that the name of the herb wormwood has nothing to do with wood or with worms , but it 's just our version of the German name , Wermuth ?  | I do n't have to tell you what a fellow like Iz would do in a case like that . I can just hear him saying to some immigrant , " Wermuth , Wermuth ? If you mean wormwood , why do n't you say so ? " Now I know , ' added Ed , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being " Rotten Row . " ' On another day Ed Whitsamen told Lemuel about the introduction of the talking-machine into the county . Lemuel had already heard that it was old Levi Graf , Uncle Valentine 's father , who had got the first Edison around those parts , but he did n't know the circumstances . I was over there that evening , ' said Ed , when he invited the neighbors over . Everybody had been saying it was the " Devil 's work . " And they said that it was a wonder Levi would n't put his money into a mowing machine or a haytender . Mrs. Gates Gilbo ? you know , she was the push of the Ladies ' Aid and all those organizations for uplift ? she gave it out that she was n't going to attend the party because it was going against the Almighty to make a machine that could talk and sing like a human . She said that if the Lord wanted wood to talk he 'd have put a mouth on a tree . At first the Baptist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to hear it . Then he said maybe he would , just to see what kind of an arrangement it was . ( It was just like Levi Graf to invite a preacher to that kind of doings . ) Smeichler said , though , if it was the sort of thing that 's like to make young people kick their heels around and play cards , he 'd preach it down . When I got there , Levi had the thing set up in the parlor , and he said , " Well , Ed , now we 'll see who can holler louder ,  | the preacher or the Devil . " That made your Uncle Valentine smile . I said the Devil would have to go some to out-holler that preacher , because I 'd heard him when I was passing the church on Sundays . When Levi shoved that black cylinder into the gear , and wound her up , he held up his hand for silence . And they all got mighty quiet . With these machines you have nowadays , the Victor and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was like a man fighting for wind . It suddenly said , in a brassy voice , " Shall We Meet Beyond the River ? Sung by the Peerless Kwaw-tett. - Eedison reCORD . " And away they went , singing like four birds in a cage , the soprano flying up into the air like a skyrocket until it brought tears to the eyes of the hired girl . That was Lib Garret . I guess she always had wanted to sing like that . The preacher sat with his mouth open up until the quartet swung into the chorus . Then he said , " Praise the Lord . " Another fellow there , Frank Rudick , from over Lodi , he shouted , " Hurray for the angels . " And Lib just dabbed her eyes , and sobbed big sobs and said , " Oh , it 's too beautiful , " and things like that . At that point Old Man Graf looked around at them , and smiled just a little . He said , in a sober way : " All right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lena at the Roller Rink . " ' Lemuel had a sudden fit of industry ? of wanting to appear in the eyes of his grandparents as a particularly diligent and responsible boy . He got busy on the woodpile . Ordinarily he split as much wood as was needed . This  | time he swung the axe with a will , and in no time at all he had a neat little pile of wood ? enough for more than a week ? and the woodbox all filled . Grandpa Nadeli , from the side porch , marveled at this . Did the old woman make you do that ? ' he cried . No , nobody told me to , ' Lemuel said proudly . My , my ! ' said the old man , with sudden energy . I like to see that . Sunday morning you can stay in bed . You need n't help with anything . ' It was as if he were speaking to one of his own sons , in the days when the chores were heavy and unavoidable . But Sunday Lemuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead he arose before the others ? even before the sun ? and began a long walk . His objective was a small shack which squatted by itself in the midst of a wide and moist section of flats , far from the road , far from any other place . Here lived the horse-trader ? a Yankee , Wilson Snader . Lemuel did not know him except by sight , but he was curious about him . He wanted to see whether he had a wife and children . He wanted to see what things looked like inside the shack . He wanted to ask the horse trader whether it was true that if you gave a horse with heaves gunpowder , it would quit heaving long enough for the trade to be made . Horse traders , Ed had said , put a live snake down the throat of an old horse to make it act lively . He wanted to ask about this . He never got as far as the horse trader 's home . On his way , he went through the muck land ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from the Danube territory grew celery and all manner of garden  | truck . And as he was passing through this section , he heard an accordion and followed the sound . The accordion stopped and was succeeded by a whole string orchestra . Lemuel knew at once that a Hungarian wedding was in progress . He knew that he would be welcome ? that all the world was welcome . A stranger boy has come to bring us luck ! ' cried a bold and dashing young man with a fierce mustache when Lemuel turned in at the lane . This was the bridegroom . Kiss him , Roszina ! ' The boy 's impulse was to run , but politeness held him fast . The bride , a lovely , plump , little thing with eyes like precious stones , smacked him moistly and emphatically upon the lips . Welcome , ' she said . You bring us luck . ' Five or six young Hungarians of his own age had come up to watch this tableau . One of them said : I know you . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' said Lemuel . I know you because you are the strong one that lifted the sledge . ' The young Hungarian puffed out his chest and said , I will show you where the chicken paprikash is . ' Lemuel lost track of what was going on . He sat under a tall , broad willow tree and watched the dancing and the merry-making . There were many people there , and more came all the time . He knew that , in the swamplands , it was a poor wedding that did not last two days , that a good one might last a week . But he did n't want to wear out his welcome , so he settled it in his mind that he would start for home about four o'clock . They brought him wine of the last vintage and they unwrapped and sliced cheeses and brought him huge slices .  | Bread , thicker than a stout woman 's waist , was brought . The children had butter on it , but the old people sprinkled a little salt on it and washed it down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bowl beside the wine so that the young couple could buy themselves a wedding present they most needed . Though he sat apart , Lemuel did not feel excluded . He felt at his ease ? that he could participate or sit still as he was inclined . The people were gay , simple , and kind . A tremendous affection for them came into his heart . When Lemuel left , he murmured to the bride , who kissed him good-bye , You are good people . ' She did not hear him because he mumbled it out of shyness , and she asked him to repeat what he said . But he grew even more bashful and just shook his head . It was raining , and Lemuel told Grandma Nadeli that he guessed he would go up in the haymow of the little horse-barn and read . Haymows were no longer Grandma Nadeli 's idea of rest , but she said , Sure , small man , ' as if she could n't imagine anything more natural . Lemuel got the Morte d'Arthur from the bookcase . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up into the haymow and laid them in front of the square door that looked out on the street semi-sideways . Then he went to the kitchen and got a jug of water and a handful of cookies and took them to the mow . Last of all he carried up Pridie . This would n't have been such hard work , since the mongrel pup was still less than a year old , but he had some sort of feeling against being carried up the ladder . Being full of his personal plans , Lemuel had n't noticed  | that that was one of those days when the dog was full of his own business . As if he had many important things to do he had been showing up here and there during the morning . One time he 'd be trotting down the road and the next he 'd appear , with an important look on his face , from the oatfield on the side toward Rosina Grabhof 's . When Lemuel called , he obligingly came to be petted ; but it was plain that that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his own affairs again . But Lemuel got Pridie up the ladder , and once they were there , the pup saw the comfort of the horse blanket and lay down on it . Lemuel had opened the square door , and they looked out over dark fields that shone in the dark day . There had been a big impetuous rain , and it looked as if there would be another one any time . The two wires of the telephone line were just even with Lemuel 's eyes . A parade of drops moved along each wire , slowly and sedately . Mostly they kept an even distance apart , but now and then one of them raced forward , caught up with the one ahead , merged with it , and fell of its own weight to the ground . The dog , watching this , put his head to one side and opened his mouth . When a drop raced forward , merged , and fell , he let out a sudden sharp bark . Then he looked at the boy for approval , and gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lemuel gave Pridie a cooky , which the dog swallowed at one gulp , and then the boy helped himself to a swig from the jug . He let the book fall open where it wanted to , and read : Wit you well , said that knight , ye shall find Sir Tristram  | there for a man of as great worship as is now living , for through his prowess he won the tournament of the Castle of Maidens , that standeth by the Hard Rock . ' He read this half-aloud , in a sort of mumble , and the dog , annoyed because Lemuel was not paying attention to him , put his wet muzzle suddenly against the boy 's face , and licked him hugely . Pridie , ' Lemuel said , sputtering . You blamed fool . I got a big notion to put you out of this haymow , you fool of a dumb dog . ' Pridie bounced up on his hind legs , curved briskly aside , and came down on his chest to the blanket with his hindquarters in the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the dog . Lemuel read in his gentle mumble and the dog calmed down and went to sleep with his nose against the boy 's ribs . After a while Lemuel went to sleep , too , with his face beside the glamorous page . And one rain after another came out of the west , chasing each other across the dark fields , and Lemuel did not wake up until the mailman 's horse came stomping along the muddy street , with the mailman singing behind his shining stormcurtains . As it approached noon , Grandma Nadeli set the table . She put the red-and-white tablecloth over the white oilcloth that had decorated the table during the forenoon . Upon this cloth she set dishes from two sets ? from an old blue willow set and from an old Delft set , blue on darker blue . The Delft set came along over from the old country . Beside each plate she set a wineglass , shaped like a small , slender tumbler ,  | half-full of golden elderberry-blossom wine . The water glasses were of very thick amber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special kutla , a noble pudding packed into the stomach of a beef and baked . Come to the table , ' said Grandma Nadeli . Yes , yes , ' answered Grandpa , and went on looking at a map in an old atlas . She poured out the water . Come on , come on . ' Yes , yes .... It tells here about the water buffaloes . ' Grandma Nadeli took the great pudding out of the oven . It did n't used to take you so long to get to the table , ' she said , when you worked in the fields . ' ' Hei , hei , ' yawned Grandpa Nadeli , my working days are over , but I still love food . ' He marked his place in the book and started to wheel himself to the table . He had spent half the morning getting dressed and the rest of the time before noon he had filled in by consulting the ancient and out-of-date atlas . Ispahan , ' he said to Grandma . Is n't that where George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother . I do n't know the names of the places , ' answered Grandma Nadeli ; it was some place on the other side of the Holy Land . ' Ispahan ; yes , that 's it , ' he said . A long way off . A long way . While I walked back and forth across a field behind a plow , he went in one direction , and got far . ' Yes , ' answered Grandma Nadeli , but when he finished , he had a long way to get home . '  | C H A P T E R T E N EIGHT-HOUR DAY GRANDMA NADELI was going to drop Lemuel off at Ora 's near the end of the day , but in the meantime she took him along for company on a visit to an old great-aunt , called ' Grosetti ' because she was such an old-womanish old woman . This Great-Aunt Frieda lived over at Polksbury , south of Kerriston , and Grandma had figured on a couple of other stops that they would make on the way back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaded room . She was very small and very old , and as the cherry rocker in which she sat was enormous , her feet were off the floor . She rocked very fast , like a five-year-old girl . She nodded briskly when her visitors came in , and then went on rocking , excluding them from her mind . Lemuel remembered that she was ninety-three years old , and that , as Grandma had said , for that age she is better than you could ask . ' After a while Great-Aunt Frieda slid to the edge of the chair , and , interrupting her daughter , Grete , who was talking to Grandma Nadeli , she asked : ' What boy is that ? ' ' That is Lemuel Hayden , Ursula 's boy , ' Grandma said . Lemuel was uncomfortable , as he always was when people spoke of him in the third person in his presence . The old lady was looking at him closely and carefully . Now and then she nodded her head up and down and looked very shrewd . At length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then Grosetti went off into one of those streaks that Grandma had warned Lemuel of . She spoke what ran through her mind , not knowing that she was speaking . Yes , ' the old woman went on , he has the Nadeli eyes and mouth , but of course he would have to have that Hayden 's nose . I mind him well ? the big , dark thing with a white hat on his head and talking big about who he was and what he was going to do and saying , " That 's the ticket ; that 's the ticket . " ' It startled Lemuel to hear his father spoken of in that way . He could almost see his father standing in the dark room . He still wore white hats . He still said , That 's the ticket ' when he approved of something . I 'll have to caution the boy not to marry an English girl . He should marry a good German or Hungarian girl ? Swiss is all right ? and have strong children . ' Lemuel began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes cookies , ' she said . Aunt Frieda leaped from the chair and rushed out to the kitchen . The cookies were extremely good . Lemuel had to eat them the way Aunt Frieda directed ? with a glass of diluted and sweetened elderberry-blossom wine . He had to dip each cooky before he ate it . You ought to come over oftener , ' the old lady said to Grandma . It ai n't more than half a mile . ' No , no , you are mixing me up with Grete , here . She 's the one who lives in Polksbury . We live off in Jacoby 's Corners . ' What 's Jacoby 's Corners that you have to be so proud of that ? ' demanded Aunt Frieda . Lemuel felt definitely better when they started back from Polksbury.  | Grandma Nadeli sat back contentedly in the phaeton , and her grandson , holding the lax reins , felt happy and spoiled . At the same time he felt anxious to be back at Ora 's and in the routine again . From a barn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand to Grandma Nadeli . She laughed and waved , and kissed her own hand to him . This was a considerable surprise to Lemuel . Ah , that 's good old Schlaphannes , ' Grandma said . That 's Hoopsi , Hoopsi , Haenseli . He is old , but not as old as he looks . He lives in that small house that is so neat , and looks almost like a bird-house . His right name is Brecht or Knecht or something like that . ' Hoopsi had two different kinds of spells ( she continued ) . Part of the time he sat by himself on his porch , with his long , skinny legs crossed , giving an imaginary child a ride on the upper foot and saying , Hoopsi , Hoopsi , Haenseli . That was how he got that name . In Hoopsi 's other spells he was mushy . If he were on a streetcar and saw two young people looking at each other with their eyes full of love , he would feel a kindness in his heart , just as anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly does me good to see young people loving each other , ' he would address himself to the couple and say , Ach , I love you , my children ! I love you ! ' When he was a very young boy he played the violoncello . His teacher in the old country was a very cross old man that thumped him with his knuckles . After a while another teacher was hired , also an old man . Instead of striking the boy with his knuckles , this teacher got very shiny in the face and wet in the eyes .  | This child , ' he said to the parents , is a genius . He will be a great artist , a famous man . ' After that this boy lived wrapped in velvet . Everyone was always very kind to him . He felt all the time as if he were going to cry from happiness . One night then he played in an aristocratic room where there were hundreds of noblemen and noblewomen . When he had finished , the noblemen wrung their hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tears they were shedding . Two weeks after that he had scarlet fever , and after that he was tone-deaf . So that was the end of the ' cello . Everyone forgot him but a very beautiful girl . When he was still very young and earning his living by writing orchestrations , she married him . It was an elopement . His wife persuaded him to go to America when the time came for him to serve his army years . You 'll send for me when you can , ' she said . Some months after he came here , he had a letter saying that his wife had died in childbed . The baby was a boy and was named Hans and he was to send money for its keep . For five years he sent money which he earned by working with his hands in a mill and doing many musical chores . Then he asked for the child to be sent him . He got a letter saying the child was not well enough to make a trip and he should send money for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old a man from the same village met him in America and said the child had died with its mother . When Hoopsi Hoopsi Haensei , ' said Grandma , walks from the depot toward the overgrown bird-house he built for  | his son , he sees children at play . He throws open his arms and says , " Children , children ! Come to me ! I love you ! " The children are frightened and run away . He chases them , pleading with them . Some of the neighbors were talking about having the judge put him away in an asylum . Your grandfather helped to stop that . ' Riding with Grandma was like getting a map of the activities of all the people whose farms they passed . There was the place where there had been a fire when only the children were at home . The eldest son had had a premonition on his way home from town . When he was still two miles away he began galloping the horses and bellowing and crying at the top of his voice . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bachelor son . They made no effort to be neighborly . Consequently , many weird tales were told about them . It had been generally believed that the woman had kept the son in girl 's clothing until he was grown up , but Grandma laughed at this . Their only sin , she said , was that they were bashful and fond of privacy . One tiny farmhouse stood empty . Its owner was away at the county farm . He had gone crazy in his old age and almost blind at the same time . The lawyer who was appointed his guardian said that the kitchen in which he found the old man was the most gruesome place he had ever seen . The children of the vicinity believed that the old man butchered calves and drank their warm blood . The little red house was the home of a very poor immigrant family . It had three boys who most of the time wore nothing but shirts . Whenever the butcher came around this family bought three cents ' worth of liver .  | There was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent Lemuel on an errand . The head of the house , in hospitality , had given him a little glass of wine . And he had proffered him a small water wheel for setting up in the creek . Along in the afternoon , as they neared Lodi , they began to pass some pretty extensive-looking farms all of which had great , elaborate barns . These barns bore names like GLENCREST FARM , or GLEN-something else , and this made Grandma exclaim : Ts , such stuff ! ' After a dozen or more of these Grandma suddenly cried , Whoops ! ' She pulled in Schelm . Following her eyes , Lemuel saw that the next big white barn bore the bold label : JUST A FARM . They were at Cousin Hat Frederick 's ! Cousin Hat was a sister of Cousin Geoffrey , but she was about as different from the poet as anybody could imagine . She was a husky-looking farmer 's wife , with a hearty laugh , and you could n't help liking her . She insisted on having Grandma and Lemuel have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect no spread ! ' she promised them . They were hardly inside the door before Hat 's husband , Ira , came in from another room where he had been sitting with his shoes off reading a farm journal . He called out , Come in and look out and you 'll see more . ' In introducing Ira , Hat said , Well , here 's the Man ! ' Ira did not say much , but whatever he said was either very serious or very waggish . He entertained Lemuel while Grandma went along to the kitchen with Hat . After only a couple of minutes Hat hollered , Well , supper 's ready , such as it is. '  | As they sat down , Ira said , Now , you folks pitch in and eat Dutch . ' Hat added : Yes , you 'll have to help yourselves . We ai n't used to passing things . ' Ira called the bread punk ' and the potatoes spuds . ' When Hat offered him the peas , he said , No , thanks , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' He referred to the red beets as deadbeats . Lemuel was fascinated by several things on the table . There was a circular object on which were three bottles which he took to be vinegar and olive oil and something else . And there was a spoon-holder . He was not yet used to either spoon-holders or toothpick-containers . Hat 's toothpickholder was shaped like a small silver chick standing next to a silver eggshell from which it had apparently emerged . Take your pick ' was engraved on one side . On the other side was Souvenir of Cedar Point . ' When Lemuel had had two helpings of everything , Ira urged him to eat more . Eat and give the house a good name , ' he said . Eat , eat , ' Hat said urgently . It 's a long time till breakfast . ' Ira ate heartily , his eyes sparkling and the skin at the corners all wrinkled up . When he had finished , he sat back and said , Well , now I 'm as grateful as if I had et @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fork . Before they left Hat obliged with one verse of an old song Grandma Nadeli had been trying to remember . It was very sad . Hat sang it in kind of sweeping up and down tones . Oh , give me three grains of corn , mother , Only three grains of corn . It 'll save the little life I have Till the coming of the morn .  | I 'm dying of hunger and cold , mother , Dying of hunger and cold . I have an agony of such a death My lips have never told . When they were in the phaeton again , Grandma Nadeli told Lemuel the circumstances of Ira 's and Hat 's courtship . She said Ira 's proposal came close to not happening at all . I ought to know , ' she laughed , I was right on the spot . ' Lemuel looked astonished at this . Grandma had been over at the Landesmans ' helping on hay-making day , she told him , that week eight years before when everybody knew that Ira Fredericks was trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Ira was there , too , being a neighbor , and he was up in the mow working the hay away , because that was the hardest part of the job . ( John Landesman had put out an extra twenty acres of hay because he had decided to fatten some steers . ) The other men said they were going to work Ira so hard he 'd have to come down out of the mow before dinner . The closer the hay got to the comb of the roof , the hotter the mow got and the meaner the hay was to handle . Ira was sweating like a butcher . With every new load , they sent up a quart of ginger-water , and he drank it without stopping . As fast as one wagon backed out of the bank barn , another was ready to pull in . Ira was covered with hay-dust . It was all over him and all over his insides . But he felt fine . Hat 's folks , John Landesman and his wife , Meely , were working together on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hat was working with Old Cliff Beer , and Louie Price and his son Freeman were on the third wagon . Grandma Nadeli came out from the kitchen now and then with the ginger-water.  | It 's a caution the way she made up to him , ' Hat 's mother said to Grandma Nadeli . I mind when the Fredericks moved over on Bidey Weyrick 's place . Hat said she thought Fredericks was the homeliest name she ever heard , and the last man in the world for her would be one that was named Fredericks . ' Well , ' said John Landesman , he has n't asked her . ' He 's tongue-tied when it comes to that , ' Meely said , but he 'll get up his dander when the time comes . ' Cliff and Hat brought in the last load before dinner . John said they 'd just let it stand and unload it after they ate , while the horses were resting . Hat was still up on top of the load when Ira came down out of the mow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bucket of water and upset it over his head . What did Ira say to you driving back from the singing last night , Hat ? ' Old Cliff yelled at her . I took note he held up about a quarter of a mile behind everybody else . ' He told me he was thinking of breaking fifteen acres of new ground in the east pasture , ' she called back . I could have found something besides ground to talk about if I 'd have been in his shoes , ' Old Cliff said . Ira rubbed the water out of his eyes with his hands and walked over to the load where Hat sat . Hat , ' he said , it looks like I 'd never have the sand to ask you when I 'm alone with you , so maybe I 'll have better luck now . Will you have me , Hat ? ' He had to move fast to catch her because she made such a sudden jump off the wagon into his arms . To Grandma Nadeli the life of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like shacks , was neither hard nor pitiful.  | A few of the truck farmers ? those who had three good years in a row ? sometimes escaped from their back-breaking work and got to the city to brick houses , and automobiles . But most of the Coffee-potters and the other neighbors did n't live good ' like those few . In Grandma Nadeli 's manifold comprehension of human work and need , living was simple enough because it was just what was there , something to be taken hold of with two hands . It did not occur to her to think that her near-pioneering life ? which had become so much a habit ? might overtax her strength or shorten her days . At the same time she would have laughed in her ringing voice if she had ever heard country life referred to as the simple life . ' Yes , country life is called the simple life , and this must be because the farmer gets up at four and goes to bed at eight , and has never read The Death of Ivan Ilyitch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stravinsky , and he thinks that Amy Lowell is a nice , old-fashioned name . The farmer does not have to know much . Aside from knowing how to milk , shock wheat , play obstetrician to a Jersey cow , train a dog , put together a binder , fan grain , build a load of hay or a wheatstack , judge weather , start a balky horse , operate a gasoline engine , repair general machinery , string fences , fiddle clover-seed , trap rats , splice rope , build sheds , butcher hogs , prepare apple-butter , prune trees , vines , and bushes , keep fruit , plant corn , potatoes , cabbage , and garden truck , sow wheat , oats , barley , millet , buckwheat , and timothy , pick seed-corn , cull hens , treat a heifer for a rotten hoof with butter antimony or a horse for the colic , harness a horse , fertilize a field , pull stumps , shingle  | a roof , watch the markets , breed livestock , weld a broken shaft , whittle out a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of machines , run a radio , and stand off lightning-rod salesmen ? he does n't have to know more than the average young man could learn in twenty years of intensive training . Unless , of course , he lives in the backwoods territories where life is even simpler , and where he has to keep track of more superstitions than a lawyer does cases . Grandma made one more stop on the way to Ora 's and that was at Neri Gingerich 's farm . He had a sort of secondhand business selling extra parts for farm machines . What he did was to buy up all the farm implements at public sales which sold for a half-dollar or less . He could n't resist a broken mower going for a quarter , or a binder so rusty and aged that nobody else would bid upon it at all . It was getting dark when they drove up and Neri was just coming in from the field . My gravy , Neri , ' said Grandma Nadeli , looks like you have n't gone on the eight-hour day yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He started to spit against the leg of the horse-trough before he remembered that it was Grandma Nadeli he was talking to . Do n't believe in that , do you ? ' she asked . No , I do n't , ' Neri answered deliberately . I think the working people that fall for that idea will wake up sometime and see what happened to them . They 'll find out the boss just made room for another shift . They 'll be doing as much in eight hours as they used to do in twelve and they 'll get less for it . You ca n't rawhide a man  | twelve hours a day . But you get him down to eight , and you can rawhide twelve hours ' worth of work out of him . The time will come when they 're making them do twelve hours ' worth of work in six hours . ' Ach , my ! ' said Grandma . Lemuel was digging about in the pile of old iron beside Neri 's shop . There were many curious things there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a mound of wheels . It was as big as a shed , and it contained buggy wheels , wagon wheels , bicycle wheels , and iron wheels of all sizes . Sunflowers grew up through the spokes . Near-by were several vehicles from which the wheels had been taken . An old buggy , with its top still up though tattered , sat on its flat bottom . A sulky lay on its side , with creepers climbing along its thills . There was also an old mud sled with a ruined stone-boat leaning up against it , and a cutter with broken runners rested its chin on an old willow stump that was sending up green shoots . Rummaging , Lemuel felt the pleasure which the remotest aristocrat feels in searching what lies on a dump . The man who finds a shaving mug in a heap of rubbish often has a satisfaction as deep as the one that goes with finding doubloons on a Caribbean cay . It is the same thing : treasureseeking . Well , ' Grandma said decisively , an eight-hour day is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' No , ' said Neri . In the summer I get up at half-past three and I work till nigh eight . Allowing for eating , that 's a fourteen-or fifteen-hour day . But in the winter I 'm through with my chores at nine o'clock in the morning , and I loaf until four , and I 'm through again at seven . That 's when I make up for it .  | The winter is rest , ' said Grandma . Yep , and if a friend of mine dies , I can always take a day off for the funeral , whether it 's summer or winter . ' Or a public sale , too , ' smiled Grandma . Ya-up . I do n't miss any sales . When people are selling a bunch of stuff all at once , I can always buy stuff for less than I can get for it , selling it a piece at a time . ' Lemuel had been listening attentively . I do n't think a twelve-hour day would be so bad , going around buying all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . Well , do you suppose you 've got a drive rod for a John Deere mower ? ' Grandma asked . Orry busted one , and asked me to stop over . ' I gosh , I think I have . I think I bought a John Deere three years ago at Luke Sennit 's sale . ' Grandma got down and insisted on helping search . They looked through a great miscellany of binder and mower parts inside the old shed until they found it . Well , ' said Neri , I got that mower for thirty-five cents , so I 'll have to charge you a nickel . '  | C H A P T E R E L E V E N PETE GURDY ' S RIG WHILE Lemuel was at Jacoby 's Corners , Clyde attended the Pioneers ' Picnic , which was held at Doner 's Lake not far from Easton . Clyde was sitting on the grass with four older men when one of the four pointed toward the road . That looks like Pete Gurdy 's rig , ' he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There ai n't another such rattletrap in the whole county . ' They all wondered , aloud , where he was going . Nobody could figure out . Pete Gurdy and his wife lived lonesome . Nobody ? not even the fertilizer salesmen or the school enumerators ? went to see them . They did not neighbor with anyone . Two or three times a year Pete went to town and bought a barrel of flour and a barrel of salt and a barrel of sugar . If anybody tried to talk to him he waved both hands above his head and said , No time for damn foolishness . ' So , naturally , they were very much surprised to see his rig on the road . And everybody was more surprised than ever when he turned in at Doner 's lane . It became evident that Pete Gurdy was going to attend the Pioneers ' Picnic . It was the first social function he had attended in the twenty-three years he had lived in the county . People had always thought of Pete Gurdy as being tallish and fierce-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost insignificant when he climbed out of the  | buggy . Not that he was really any shorter ? he just looked less of a man with that silly , eager grin on his face . Some of the men walked over while he was hitching his horse . Well , Gurdy , ' one of them said , you 're kind of giving us a surprise . ' A fellow ought to get out among his fellow man now and then , ' Pete said , grinning all the harder and looking as if he was afraid maybe they 'd send him home . He was in everything that happened all during the day . At the table , he had to hear everything that was said , even if it had to be repeated , and he babbled out his own ideas on all kinds of subjects . He tried to make jokes , and the best you could say for them was that they showed he had a willing heart . Nobody could figure him out . Some said he had just come to his senses . Others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . One of the women asked after his wife . Pete Gurdy changed his face and said , She wo n't be here . ' Amos told Clyde he figured maybe Pete had sneaked off . When the time came to break up , Pete tried to get people to stay a little longer . He bothered men while they were hitching up and tried to persuade some people to stay on for supper . There 's plenty of grub left , ' he said , and there 's a full moon tonight . You can do your chores by the moon . ' He was the last to leave . The next day Old Man Lowden drove over to Pete 's place . Everybody was sick of hearing Old Man Lowden talk about the taxes . He had an idea that with Pete Gurdy in such a sociable frame of mind he could use him for a new audience .  | Old Man Lowden found Pete hanging from a rafter in the barn with his tongue sticking out . He found Pete 's wife in the manger , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she must have been dead at least two weeks .  | C H A P T E R T W E L V E MUSHRAT GEER LEMUEL waited in the shed at Hinckley 's Crossing , which was Stop 112 . The shed was built to shelter persons like him who were waiting for the interurban . A lot of waiting was done , because people were always early and the interurban was always late . While they waited , people did their part toward decorating the walls . This had been going on so long , and people had been so diligent and resourceful , that Lemuel was able to put in his whole hour studying the walls , with never a dull moment . Many of the contributors to the walls of the waiting-room had merely written their names . Usually they added the dates . Lemuel was interested to discover that his Uncle Valentine had waited for the interurban in the fall of 1902 . The two schools of penmanship were well represented ? the crabbed ancient school , which wrote like an Elizabethan manuscript , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smeed , the writing teacher , and ran to birds of impossible beauty drawn all in one incredible line . There were those who were not satisfied with the ephemeral record of the pencil , but had cut into the wood itself to carve their names more lastingly . Over all these names and initials , written plain or fancy , carved deep or shallow , was the comment of a verse which some cynic , some nonconformist , had written : Fools ' names as well as faces Are often seen in public places .  | There was little of the Eddie loves Susie ' sort of thing which was familiar to Lemuel from his days in New York . In Wayne County ' a young man 's loves were his own business , and nobody took up the chalk to besmear either masonry or board with a violation of that privacy . But one young man of unknown identity , overmastered by that enthusiasm which so often drives men to literature , had written , with a thick pencil , the gallant scrawl : Rosie Crouse Is the Pertiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosie Crouse was Mrs. Rosie Grossabeck , mother of five , a plump and comely matron . Was it , Lemuel wondered , Pete Grossabeck that wrote the glowing line ? The small history of minor events was recorded on the walls of the waiting-shed . Ed Whonsettler and Eli Smith , 1905 . Just back from the Pittsburgh excursion . ' In another script , probably Eli 's : And danged glad to be back . ' Norton Fike , running for Legislature , 1902.2 ' Jake Lichty , Nov. 16 , 1904 . Got 47 rabbits today . ' Art was here as well as history . Besides three Spencerian birds there was the traditional scrupulous drawing of an iron kettle hanging by an S-hook from a pole between two X-standards , with symmetrical fire arising from a pile of meticulous wood . There were eight drawings of horses , all in full profile , and a very amateurish sketch of a sow suckling some pigs that looked more like fish . Lemuel started to make a closer inspection of the bills advertising a PUBLIC VENDUE . On two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was announced as ' In earlier books the county was referred to as Kerris County .  | auctioneer . Suddenly it occurred to Lemuel to put his ear to the track . The interurban was eighteen minutes overdue . Sure enough , there was a faint whining and clicking in the steel . A few minutes later the car came into view far down the track . It came gallantly forward , with little sidewise jerks , breasting the tall weeds that grew between the ties . In much less time than he had waited for it , the interurban got Lemuel to Kerriston to accomplish his errands . Lemuel arrived at the square of the county seat with a feeling of awe . Not that the square was large , not that the courthouse which occupied the square was as tall as the Singer Building . But in New York people went about their business treating big buildings and city sights casually . The county-seat square was deliberately and heavily impressive . The courthouse looked about ten times as massive as its size justified ; the square was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elephants and it was armed with cannons fit to defend a peninsula . Large letters above the arched main doorway proclaimed that the courthouse had been erected in the year 1886 . The people of the county had spent real money upon it . The stones below its windows were three feet thick and its steps were of marble so wide and fine that twenty-four princesses in red velvet dresses would not have looked out of place pacing down them . Nothing had been done to renovate or preserve its looks , and the result was that it had accumulated a dinginess which made the impressiveness all the more oppressive . The courthouse rose to a great and stubby dome , on top of which was the effigy of a plump-bosomed woman with her  | eyes bound shut with a rag of sandstone , a sandstone sword in one of her hands and a pair of sandstone scales in the other . Two families of robins had pre-empted the trays of the scales . The woman never smote them with her sandstone sword , and the sandstone scales showed they weighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then looked into the window of the Galen Whittle Dry Goods Emporium and Racket Store . The window was populated by heads ? wax , with simpering , sweet faces . Most of the hats were of the kind known as peach baskets . ' They were about the size of a peck measure and were intended to set up on top of the head . Lemuel wanted to buy Amanda a hat . He had formed the intention when he heard her tell Barbara that she had wanted a new Sunday hat for a long time . Business was slow and Mr. Galen Whittle was waiting on all the trade himself . He had sent his daughter home to help her mother , and he had laid off old Emily Stibbs , his other clerk , for the afternoon . Sadie Rebman , the old maid with the hairy jaw who was his cashier and bookkeeper , was at work in the office , a varnished wooden box that was suspended from the ceiling in the rear of the store . There was one customer in the store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was buying some cheesecloth . Lemuel looked around while he waited his turn . He was hoping he would see some hats so he could pick one before Mr. Whittle came to wait on him , but he could n't find them . Well , boy ! ' said Mr. Whittle when the woman had gone . His manner showed very plainly that he suspected Lemuel of nothing better than an attempt to waste his time .  | I 'd like to buy a hat . ' Mr. Whittle looked suspiciously at Lemuel . Does your maw know you 're buying it ? ' he asked . My mother is in New York , ' Lemuel said . New York , eh ? ' said Mr. Whittle . What size do you wear , eh ? ' I do n't want it for myself , ' Lemuel said . I want it for a ? for a girl . ' Mr. Whittle 's eyes , under his bushy eyebrows , fixed the boy with a stern , unyielding stare . He very obviously was convinced that Lemuel was doing something he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or speak . Like you 've got in the window , ' Lemuel said . Mr. Whittle picked up the bolt of cheesecloth from which he had cut the previous customer 's order . He shoved it lengthwise into a shelf . You tell whoever wants the hat to come in here and buy it , ' he said . I ai n't going to get in no trouble selling no boy no woomiun 's hat . ' Lemuel still had two hours to wait at Kerriston . That was the best connection made there by the two interurbans that intersected there . For a while he sat in the interurban station , but it was not a very interesting or comfortable place to be . The walls were plain plaster , painted an unhappy yellow . The partitions were plain wood , varnished an unwholesome red . There was a smell of disuse about . The only relief on the walls consisted of a Regulator clock and a large poster advertising Cedar Point . In one corner of the room was a machine which sold chewing-gum balls . It  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a penny or not ? as if it did n't care whether it gave you chewing gum or not if you did put in a penny . In another corner stood an ancient stove of thick iron . It had been red-hot so often that some of the red still showed , though it was cold and dead-looking . After a while Lemuel went back up the street to Blaser 's Druggery and bought himself a sundae . He sat down on a spindly chair which had curling wires for legs and back and a seat too small to sit on . The table had a glass top , and underneath the glass , in a deep compartment , were several boxes of Lowney 's Chocolates . The ice cream parlor was at the rear of the druggery . Its walls were lined with mirrors and on the mirrors were painted the names and prices of the fancy sundaes . Lemuel struggled over a choice among the Fruit Salad ( 15 cents ) , the North Pole ( 15 cents ) , the Club House ( 15 cents ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a while he took the Isle of Spice Special . It was n't any better than a 15-center . It had some cinnamon on it . That was where the Isle of Spice came in . Next door was the Public Library . Lemuel went in . Priscilla Guttshick was the librarian . She regarded her work as a calling . Her mission was to bring culture to Wayne County . When I think , ' she once said , that not one person in ten in this community has ever read Winston Churchill , my blood runs cold . ' Every Thursday night she had a class in literature , and the foremost women of the county ( all but the very foremost ) attended , bringing their husbands . She told them about  | Wordsworth and Henry van Dyke , and every week they voted which piece by Doctor Frank Crane ( whose essays were published daily in the Intelligencer ) they liked best . One night they all wrote poems , and Miss Guttshick was amazed and delighted at how good they were . When Lemuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading and rose with restrained but obvious eagerness . Welcome to our library ! ' she cried . The greatest men in the world are here to talk with you . ' Lemuel looked around . She made him nervous . Uh , ' he said , I ? uh ? I guess it 's time for the interurban . I was ? uh ? just looking . ' He turned and fled . Miss Guttshick looked sadly after him and picked up her book again . The interurban sped through the swampy lushness with many a sideways lurch . Lemuel lurched with it . He was feeling rather proud of the fact that it would still be early afternoon when he got back . Suddenly there was a jerk harder than the others . The interurban staggered , leaned , and came to a violent stop . Windows broke . There was a great sound of splintering . This sound died and left the air full of the fright of birds . Lemuel put his hand to his forehead where it had hit the brass grip on the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not bleeding . The interurban had left the tracks and had struck an ancient sycamore tree . The motorman stood beside the wreckage holding both hands against his right side and making an alarming shuddering  | sound : d-d-d-d-d-d-d . ' A woman inside the car was shouting : Get me out of here . Get me out . ' The conductor had got hold of an axe and was hacking away at the sill of a window . The passengers who had n't been in the smoker could n't get out because the car warped and the doors jammed . When all the passengers were out and it was established that nobody ( not even the motorman ) was badly hurt , the conductor announced in a loud voice that the only thing to do was to wait three hours until the next interurban came along . The traveling salesman who had been in the smoker hired a farmer who was attracted by the crash to drive him to the nearest town . The woman who had shouted to be left out invited herself along . There was no room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track . Lemuel helped for a while at the work of spiking down the loose rail which had caused the wreck , then he wandered off along a path which used the timbers of a lock as a bridge . The path led down a brisk , stony , wooded incline to the bank of the river . There it led upstream . Lemuel had walked nearly a half-mile when he came to a cabin . It was a shack of plain boards , sheet metal , and tar paper . There was nothing about it to indicate that whoever lived there would be pleased to have company . Lemuel stood there . He could n't decide whether to turn around and go back or walk past it . At length he turned and began to retrace his steps . A shout halted him . He saw an old , gaunt , bearded man standing partly behind a tree , holding a rifle . Just stay where you are , ' the old man commanded .  | When Lemuel turned and saw him clearly , he realized that he had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had heard about the lean old man . People called him a river rat . He did n't work . He shot squirrel and rabbit , in and out of season , and he caught fish legally and illegally . He had a reputation for stealing , but most men said that he would n't take anything but a few mushmelons or some tobacco out of a field . There was a general belief that he sucked stolen eggs and that he was part Indian . Mushrat Geer had formerly shared his lot with his older brother , who was called Pacer Geer because he had been a fast runner in the days when men who hung around saloons liked to bet on foot-races . They lived in a small , old-fashioned house a little way farther down the river . They had batched it for some twenty years , and people who looked in when they were gone said the place was a regular hogpen . One day the preacher 's wife got a bunch of women to go there while the old bachelors were away and straighten out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they got through , the place looked like something fit for a human being . The Pacer and Mushrat did n't take the neighborly act kindly . They burned the house down and built a tar-paper shack up the river at one of their favorite muskrat slides . Mushrat stopped Ed Whitsamen one day when Ed was driving to town and told him : You pass the word to that preacher to keep his woman away from here . The next time she shows up we 'll send her over the falls . ' When the preacher went to see Mushrat about that , Mushrat  | was cleaning his rifle . When he finished cleaning the gun , he loaded it . Mushrat raised the gun to his shoulder and aimed it in the neighborhood of the preacher 's head . The preacher went away and tried to swear out a warrant against Mushrat , but the little squire at Kerriston said that if Mushrat had shot at the preacher he 'd have hit him and there was n't any law against shooting gourds . He told the preacher people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd just leave them alone . And that was the truth . One night Doc Allen was asleep when he heard somebody banging at the front door . He put on his pants and went down to see who it was , and there stood Mushrat Geer with his brother over his shoulder . There 's something wrong with Pacer , ' said Mushrat . He 's hotter than a stove and he 's a-whistling up and down his windpipe like a heavey horse . You fix him up . ' The Pacer had pneumonia and he died that night . The Mushrat would n't let them call an undertaker . He carried the body back the way he carried it over ? something like four miles . Nobody knows where he buried his brother . Ed Whitsamen said he heard Mushrat putting on -a funeral in the tar-paper shanty . He said Mushrat sang ' Onward , Christian Soldiers . ' Glory , Glory , Hallelujah , ' and Yankee Doodle . ' Lemuel watched as the old river hermit walked toward him . He was n't pointing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm . But he looked determined . Lemuel kept standing still , the way he had been told to do . What you doing here ? ' Mushrat asked . There was a wreck on the interurban , ' Lemuel said , and I was just taking a walk till the next car comes . '  | A wreck , huh ? Where ? Up by the bend ? ' Mushrat spat in the dust . Knew there would be . I 've spiked down that loose rail about four times for ' em . Then I got sick and tired of it . If they do n't spike down their rails they can have wrecks . ' Yes , sir , ' said Lemuel . Ca n't you say ya-uh , like a human being ? ' demanded the old man . Ya-uh , ' said Lemuel . The hermit turned and walked toward the shanty . Come on , ' he said . " Long as you 're here , you might as well set down . ' Lemuel , who always had to be sure that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about to make excuses , but the hermit , in an annoyed voice , said : Come on , come on . Do n't stand there like a crane on one leg . ' So Lemuel went along . Set down on the bench , ' the hermit said . I 'm going down and get my string . ' Lemuel watched him draw out of the water a hooked willow wand with four fish upon it . With an ancient pocketknife , the old man set to work cleaning the fish . I was a-walking up the ravine this morning , ' said the hermit , when I see a shitepoke a-setting on the limb of a sassafras tree . He made me remember something . When I was a boy and I could n't shoot none too good , I seen a shitepoke a-setting on a fencepost . Well , sir , a shitepoke is about nine parts feathers . I blazed at him and I hit the feathers , but not the shitepoke . That danged shitepoke he did n't even move . That made me mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight . I  | shot at him about a dozen times , and he did n't move and I did n't hit him . ' He went into the shanty carrying the fish . From inside came his voice : I hit one this morning , though . ' The fish , Lemuel soon learned , were very good . There was nothing else to eat . If you 're a-looking for any radishes or pole-beans or anything the like of that , you can look somewhere else , ' said Mushrat . I believe in eating one thing at a time . People would be better off if they did that . A man ca n't do more than one thing at a time , and the stomach gets rattled when you throw in a half-dozen different kinds of stuff . That 's what gives people the bellyache . I ai n't et nothing but fish now for four days . When I get enough , I 'll eat something else . That 's the way to eat . ' After they had eaten , Mushrat said to Lemuel : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call . You 're welcome to come along or stay here or go about your business as you 're a mind to . ' I 'd go along , only I 'm afraid I 'll miss the car , ' said Lemuel . You ca n't miss it where I 'm going , ' said Mushrat Geer . It goes right past there and it 'll stop if you flag it . ' All right , ' said Lemuel . The hermit went down to the creek and drew up a string which had been tied to the trunk of a sapling . It was thick with little fish , about the size of a hand or less . ' Them 's blue-gills , ' said the Mushrat . I caught them last night over at Paradise Pond . It ai n't against the law to catch them . I 'm taking them over to Red Squires ' roadhouse . What he does with them is no business of mine . ' He turned and fastened Lemuel with a sharp look . Is it ? ' he demanded .  | No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old man snickered . He 'll fry ' em and sell ' em , ' he said . Nobody 'll catch him at it because he wo n't sell to nobody he do n't know . Just like his whiskey . The reason it 's a nickel a glass is because it was made right here in these woods . Did you ever see a liquor still ? ' No , ' said Lemuel . It ai n't much of a sight , ' said the old man . Red Squires ' roadhouse was a pretty bleak-looking affair . It was just an old house that had never been anything to look at , and Red had let the yard go to weeds and had n't bothered about paint or anything like that . At first , the place looked as if nobody lived there , except that there were usually a couple of rigs tied up to the trees in back . The interurban tracks ran within six feet of the front steps . In a way , it was dreary inside , too . Things looked flyspecked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and several tables covered with oilcloth that was full of holes and had its pattern worn off in various places . Parallel with the bar , but along the opposite wall , was a curious contraption of which the main part was a long stretch of two-foot iron pipe about five feet from the floor . Lemuel did not know what this was until after he had drunk a glass of beer with Red Squires ( who turned out to be a very gray-headed old man ) and Mushrat Geer and an old fat man with a nose that looked like a sponge which had been dipped in red paint . ' I 'll shoot you for the beers , ' Mushrat said . But instead of bringing out the dice , Red Squires brought out a rifle . The  | long contraption was a shooting range . You shot in at one end ; the target was at the other . The pipe kept any bullets from going wild . Both Red Squires and the Mushrat were good shots . It took four rounds of ten shots each before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who missed . The drinks were on the house . It 's a good thing , ' Red said , when they had finished shooting , that you brought me them blue-gills . Mike Shay and the prosecutor and Jimmy Steel are a-coming over here tonight with Agnes Twitchell and two actresses . ' He turned to Lemuel . Mike Shay is the boss of this county , ' he said . He sure loves blue-gills . ' Wo n't the prosecutor arrest you for selling blue-gills ? ' Lemuel asked . Red Squires and Mushrat Geer laughed . He wo n't arrest nobody unless Mike Shay tells him to , ' said Red Squires . He never arrested Agnes , did he ? ' I do n't know , ' said Lemuel . Well , he never did . ' Lemuel did not know Agnes Twitchell or what she did to expose herself to the possibility of arrest . You going to tell your Cousin Ora that you been here ? ' Red Squires asked Lemuel a little later . Why , I guess so . Had n't I ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't mind . He ca n't do me any harm . Only I imagine he 'll be surprised . Your Cousin Ora do n't think much of my place , you know . ' Oh . ' ' Ora 's all right , ' said Mushrat.  | Of course he 's all right , ' Red said . If he do n't believe in having a good time now and then , that 's his own lookout . ' Lemuel decided he would n't tell Ora . Then he decided he would . Two young men came in . One of them was in overalls and the other was dressed up and looked as if he was used to being that way . The one in overalls said : Hah-ya , Red . Hello , Mushrat , you old carp . Will you shoot for some money ? ' Mushrat Geer spat into the tarnished cuspidor and made no answer . Still a-scared , ' said the young man in overalls . He moved over to the bar and Red Squires went to wait on them . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's one of them Houser boys . They 're crooked as a dog 's hind leg . Steal horses . ' Lemuel heard the two young men talk about dynamiting fish . They were on that subject when the interurban came down the track . When Lemuel dropped off the interurban and began his walk back to Ora 's place , it was a quiet and pleasant late afternoon . He took off his shoes and stockings . He tucked the stockings into the shoes , tied the shoestrings together , and hung the shoes over his nape . The dust was deep and soft . It fell away from his feet like water ; it spouted up between his toes . He felt so good he began to sing in a very loud voice . Lemuel cut down on the singing when he heard the thunder-grumble of a buggy crossing a bridge a quarter of a mile behind him . Pretty soon the buggy caught up . Lemuel stood aside in the dusty ragweeds to let it pass .  | A plump and genial man was driving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lines and said : Whoa , there , Sarah . Hodd-doo . Hodd-doo . Hodd-doo . ' Howdy-do , ' said Lemuel . If you 're a-going my way , bub , ' said the plump and genial man , ai n't nothing to stop you from jumping into this rig and riding a piece . Where you going ? ' To Ora Weiler 's . ' Well , my land ! Get in . I 'm a-going there my own self . Get in . Lay over , there , Sarah , and open up the wheel a little . ' I reckon , ' said the genial man , in a very genial voice , you do n't know who I am . ' I guess I do n't , ' said Lemuel . Well , bub , I 'm Luke G. Gassaway , candydate for the House of Representatives in the Gennel Assembly of this sovereign state . That 's who I am . Nominated in due form by the Democratic Party of Wayne County , signed and attested , out feeling the public pulse and soliciting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some good laws and throw out the laws that makes the taxes too high . Bub , ' he continued , his voice growing stilted and oratorical , do you know that in five years the taxes in this county has riz three mills , three-tenths of a cent , or three cents on the dollar ? Three cents is interest on fifty cents . Think that over , my fellow citizen , and when you go to the polls , vote for a man that knows what 's the matter and what to do about it . ' Yes , sir , ' said Lemuel . It turned out that Luke G. Gassaway was planning to call on Ora to ask him to use his influence in behalf of Luke 's campaign .  | I know , ' said Luke , that Ora ai n't a mind to get into politics , and I honor him for it . Politics is a dirty business and nobody knows it better than I do , after what they almost done to me . But he knows a powerful lot of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be doing me a good turn , and Ora , too , if you 'd put in a word with him to get him to mention my name to people around the township . You 'll do that , wo n't you ? ' Lemuel , because he did n't know what else to say , said he would .  | CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE BULL NEAR Ora 's place , a little farther along the road , but opposite some of his fields , lived Melchoir Stroh , who had eleven acres of truck garden , a greenhouse , and eight children . Once , when most of the children were down with chickenpox and thus suddenly left their father short-handed , Lemuel went over to earn fifty cents by a day 's work in the greenhouse . Melchoir was an animated little man with curly hair and a face that looked curly , too , as if he did n't know whether to laugh or cry . He had one blue eye and one brown one . First off he said : Oho , here 's my hired man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' In the greenhouse there was a new smell ; it was the smell of earth kept very warm ? though not the smell of hot earth in summer , but a more confined , more pungent one . Mingled with this was the smell of steam with which the greenhouse was heated . It seemed to Lemuel also that there was a smell of glass , although he had never before thought that glass gave forth any smell . And there was the perfume of vegetation . All of the odors together were so strong that they made Lemuel 's head swim at first , but he soon got used to them . After Melchoir had put him to work spading up ground , the truck farmer took the horse and wagon and went back to the end of the farm for a load of corn fodder . It was easy work , because the ground was soft and crumbly .  | There were no lumps or stones , and there had not been sod on that soil for many years . When Lemuel had spaded a row , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that with the next spadings . When Melchoir drove up with his load of fodder , he stuck his head in the door and spoke in an excited voice , How often have you rested ? ' I have n't rested at all , ' answered Lemuel . The little man slapped his hand on his leg and laughed uproariously . You should have rested two times . Sit down now and rest double long . Do you play seven-up ? No ? Dang the luck ! ' Lemuel was surprised at the noon meal he ate with Mr. and Mrs. Stroh and the three children who were able to come to the table . It consisted of a big loaf of bread in the middle of the table , a platter loaded with chunks of yellow cheese , and a bottle of weak wine that went around and around . And it was good . When the day 's work was over , Melchoir gave Lemuel two half-dollars . Just show Ora one , ' he said , or he 'll take them both away from you . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lemuel , before he noticed the broad grin on the little man . He slapped his thigh and laughed as if the boy had said the funniest thing he had ever heard . From that day 's sample Lemuel did n't have much of an idea of what the Stroh place was like when all of the family were up and around . One evening Melchoir and his old red dog and his boy , Loody , stopped in at Ora 's with some celery . Melchoir invited Lemuel to go along and stay overnight at his house . It was n't just an invitation . It was a sort of passionate plea , as  | if he were asking Lemuel for a great favor that was no more than his just due . So Lemuel went along . Before nightfall he discovered that the Stroh kids were rough players . Their idea of a good game was to climb something . He had already noticed that one of the eight had a broken arm or a broken leg almost any time he passed by . They all worked hard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to raise thunder . When they talked to each other , it was n't just plain ordinary talk . They got into wild arguments over anything . With all the laughing , screaming , bawling , and mauling , Lemuel felt pretty tired even before he got to bed . The visitor was to sleep with two of the boys in a room which contained two beds and a pallet . He was between Oscar , who was thirteen and who kicked in his sleep , and Pete , who was four and given to hugging . After an hour of wild turmoil in the course of which Melchoir and his wife both came into the room shouting with indignant fury , they all quieted down . But Lemuel did not go to sleep . After a while he saw lightning , and then he heard a thunder-rumble . The rumble was a long way off , and it was gentle and tolerant , and Lemuel went to sleep . All of a sudden he was yanked out of sleep by a terrible jerk on his arm and a loud crack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an impression that lightning had struck his shoulder . But then he saw Mrs. Stroh , with her hair down around her face , standing beside him jerking at him . Up , up , up , ' she kept saying . The whole family was aroused . They all went down into the kitchen , where they  | moved the table to the wall and put two mattresses on the floor . They crowded together on these mattresses . The idea seemed to be that , if you stood on a mattress , the lightning would not get you . But the kids started pushing each other , and in a few minutes there was a free-for-all on the two mattresses , with Mr. and Mrs. Stroh surmounting the turmoil , yelling , cuffing , laughing , kicking , and threatening their offsprings with hell-fire , strap-lammings , and death by lightning . In the morning Lemuel woke up in a crowded bed . Little Pete was clinging to him with the grip of a drowning man . Oscar was wrapped up in the covers . Lemuel had a heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big brindle dog with many burrs in its matted hair . He had found his way into the house and he was making himself at home . Lemuel kicked the dog until , with a resigned look , the animal rose from its rest , licked Lemuel 's face , and leaped down to the floor . Lemuel put on his shirt . But he could n't find his pants . He hunted and hunted , looking through piles of scrambled garments on the floor . Finally he became aware of giggling on the other side of the wall . Hey , ' he said , who took my pants ? ' Look out of the window , ' said a tittering girl 's voice . Out in the front yard , climbing a tree , was Katie , the eleven-yearold sister . She was well up in the tree . And she was wearing Lemuel 's pants . ' Hey ! ' he shouted , get back here and put those pants where you found them . ' Come and get them , ' Katie answered .  | That stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said archly . Annie , ' she shouted , throw my dress in the boys ' room so Lemuel can wear it . ' A sudden torrent of scolding and denunciation issued from the door below , and Mrs. Stroh came out of the door shouting at her daughter in a mixture of three languages . The daughter came down the tree and did some fast side-stepping to avoid the blows which Mrs. Stroh aimed at her ears . In a few moments , Mrs. Stroh opened the door and threw the pants at Lemuel , acting as if she thought he was partially to blame . Lemuel was very glad to have his pants . Breakfast consisted of a big kettle of green beans boiled with a ham joint . Mrs. Stroh bore it to the table , with the red dog and two of her youngsters batting around her legs . She screamed in a fury , swearing she would drop the kettle and scald them all to death . But she got it to the table safely . All jaws were working hard when Emmie , the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a peremptory voice . Yah , what ? ' said Mr. Stroh , smiling but busy . Katie wore Lemuel 's pants . ' Ach , Dummheit , ' said Mr. Stroh . Keep your mouth shut and eat . ' All the children began to snicker and giggle . You ca n't keep your mouth shut and eat , ' said Katie . And Emmie poked at her face with a forkful of beans to show how it could n't be done . Melchoir raised a threatening hand and the excitement died down . When the children were no longer watching he winked at Lemuel . In a half-hour they were all working in the potato patch .  | Julius , the biggest Stroh boy , beckoned to Lemuel . They were all on their hands and knees in the garden . Did you ever eat a Wayne County banana ? ' he asked . He held out in his hand something that certainly looked like a red pepper . It looks like a red pepper , ' said Lemuel . Sure , ' said Julius . That 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If they knew how good they was , they 'd grab them before a feller could get them picked . Here . Taste it , once . ' Oh , I do n't think so , ' said Lemuel . Go on . Are you scared ? Gosh sakes . Scared of a little banana . ' I think it 's a red pepper . ' You 're scared , is all that 's the matter . ' So Lemuel took a bite . It was a red pepper . For the next two hours his tongue smarted , and that was n't helped any by the fact that all the Stroh kids kept teasing him about it . Hey , there , bananas , ' they would say ; or , How would you like a Wayne County grape ? ' and throw him a pebble . Even the rosebud-faced little three-year-old looked at him with serious eyes and said , Bininnee . ' Oscar handed the little girl a fishworm . You eat that , ' he said , and you 'll get a mustache just like Steve Dobrosh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worm in her mouth when her mother knocked it from her hand and , with the next swing of her arm , walloped the boy beside the head . He went off by himself , mumbling in an injured and threatening way . Mrs. Stroh jerked the little girl around by the arm a few times , and went back to work .  | In the middle of the forenoon the oldest girl , Riki , who stayed at the house to take care of the baby and do the housework , came out pulling a wagon containing the baby , a twogallon jug , and a shoe-box full of cheese . They all quit working and sat down to eat . For a few moments there was silence , then Lemuel felt something on the back of his neck . It turned out to be a particularly nasty green caterpillar . Lemuel gave a yelp and a jump , and Mrs. Stroh waded among her brood , dealing out slaps and blows with great impartiality and emphasis , so as to be sure and punish the right one . Lemuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept a careful but furtive eye on Julius . Sure enough , he caught him putting a rotten potato in the pocket of Lemuel 's coat , hanging under the tree at the gate . So Lemuel went into action . He hit Julius in the stomach and straightened him up with a jab to the chin . The glad lust of battle was on him . And the next minute he was smothered under a veritable avalanche of scolding , screaming Strohs . He went home with his chin shaking with anger and a sense of injustice , and did n't turn around when a stone flew by his head . Ora was just driving out of the barn with the hayrack . Lemuel was sitting on the edge with his feet hanging down . They saw Riki Stroh come running up the lane . She was screaming something . When she got close enough so they could hear what she was yelling , they heard her shout : Call the doctor ! Call the doctor ! Oh , my papa , my papa ! The bull , the bull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Lemuel and jumped off the wagon . He ran into the house . Barbara and Amanda came out . They tried to quiet Riki ; tried to find out what was wrong . The doctor is on his way , ' Ora said , climbing back onto the rack . Jump on here , Riki . ' I 'll go , too , ' said Barbara . Then Amanda should stay with the baby , ' Ora said . It was a terribly bumpy ride down the lane on the hayrack . Lemuel 's teeth clicked together . Riki got a little better hold of herself . The bull bucked papa , ' she said . He was in the orchard . Julius killed the bull . I know papa is dying . ' Melchoir Stroh lay on the grass in the orchard under a tree that was sagging down with half-grown apples . He was awfully white and he was talking in a low voice . His wife was kneeling beside him . The children stood around , looking very scared . We 'll take him to the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Melchoir . They tried , but it hurts me too much . When I lie still I 'm not in pain . ' His back must be broke , ' Mrs. Stroh said . Her face was drawn tight like the skin of a drum but , for her , she spoke quietly . The bull hit him right in the small of the back . ' A cry of rage came out of the throat of Oscar Stroh . He rushed at the carcass of the bull and began kicking it in wild fury . The carcass was slumped up against the nearest tree . A rifle which had been broken over its head lay as it broke . I 'm not going to last so long , ' Melchoir said , in a low voice , a little apologetic . I must talk now . Ora , you see my little ones and my wife . Soon there will be no man here . They act wild , but  | they 're good children . Watch over them a little . Tell them about the planting . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' said Ora , do n't you worry . ' I 'm not worrying . The rest of you must not worry , either . Mama , you must be the man here now , until Julius is a little older . Buy more new seed for this fall . I think you 'll have a good year . Riki , you must be the mother now . Take care of the little children . Julius , you are brave . It is not necessary for a brave boy to be hot-headed . Keep your temper . You 're the oldest boy , but you must not think you are a man until you are one . Let mama give the orders until she tells you it is your turn . You are good children A puzzled look and then a little smile came over his face . He quit speaking .  | CHAPTER FOURTEEN HORSESHOES LEMUEL stopped at Uncle Simon 's . He had n't expected to go any farther , but Clyde persuaded him to ride along in to Kerriston with him . He had some errands to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anyway . Maybe I can help with the errands , ' said Lemuel . Clyde looked mysterious . No siree , sir , bobtail rooster , you ca n't help . ' So Lemuel guessed that the errands might have something to do with Elsie Himmelreich . The deduction was simple . When he himself had made a special trip to Kerriston it had been to buy Amanda a hat ; Clyde had heard that Elsie was about to come back home from her summer holiday ; ergo , Clyde was getting her something . Lemuel felt very cordial about the whole thing . He could hardly believe that he had resented Clyde 's teasing of Amanda , and had even felt downright mean about it . Since the lawn fete he saw it all with a new perspective . Why do n't I meet you over at Charlie Puff 's poolroom ? ' Clyde asked . You can watch the games . ' But since there was time , Lemuel stopped in first at the blacksmith shop . Long before he got there he heard the merry clinging and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like a cave in some story about trolls and gnomes . Its walls were hung with many shapes of iron . The boss blacksmith , a handsome big blond man , was squatting beside a big Percheron horse , holdings its hoof in  | his lap and paring away at it with a hook-shaped knife . The sleeves were torn out of his dark gray shirt ; his arms were huge and bare . He wore a split leather apron . The helper blacksmith was working at the forge , one arm upraised to work the bellows and the other employed with tongs and fire . Neither paid any attention to Lemuel at first . But when the helper clipped a bit of white-hot iron from the end of a rod he was fashioning into a shoe , the boss smith glanced at Lemuel and said : Careful , and do n't step on that , bub . ' Yes , sir , ' said Lemuel . After a while the smith spat and said : I mind once a young fellow in this shop stepped on a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barefoot a long time , I reckon , and he had a thundering thick sole of callus on his foot , so he did n't feel the iron till it burned all the way through that . I had to pull that iron out of his foot with the pinchers . I swear I never saw a man thrash around the way he did . Whoa , now , boy . Easy . Take it easy , now . ' The smith 's helper was a squat , dark man with sober eyes and a merry mouth and shoulders as wide as a buggy-shed and thick as a culvert stone . He talked in a foreign way because he came from Hungary ? from a village named after the crowing of a rooster . Came once into my father 's blacksmith shop when I was a boy , ' he said , a man what he was leading a baboon . My , he was a smart monkey . If you would throw him something , he would catch it like nothing . Was working for my father a wild fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwed to the baboon a piece of red-hot iron . ' Whew ! We all ranned out from that shop and locked shut the door , and when the monkey was finally finished the whole place was wrecked like a train . Whew ! ' There was a small forge beside the big one . The small forge was a neat contrivance of steel with a small bed of coals . It worked with a crank . Want to turn that crank for me ? ' asked the smith . Lemuel certainly wanted to . The smith put a little piece of iron into it with a long pair of pinchers , and kept turning and poking . Finally the iron started to give off sparks like a Fourth of July sparkler . Lemuel 's eyes got bigger than saucers . I never knew , ' he said , blacksmiths could make stars . ' They were to tell that one on him around Wayne County for years afterward . The big Percheron horse stirred uneasily when the smith picked up his hind hoof by the fetlock , and the smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent , exciting words delivered in a soothing sort of voice . Do blacksmiths always swear at horses ? ' asked Lemuel . Yes , they do , ' said the smith . Take over at Tallmadge , over in Summit County . That was a religious town . It was started by religious people . Everything was run by the Congregational Church . If you had a lawsuit , the preacher was the judge and the deacons were the jury . You did n't pay any taxes ; you paid tithes . Well , sir , you 'd know that one of the first things they 'd pass a law against would be cussing.  | Well , of course , they were all a bunch of Yankees , and there was n't a blacksmith amongst them . So they asked around in the Pennsylvania Dutch townships whether there was n't somebody that would like to open a shop . There was a fellow named Boosinger that did . He was a Dutchman and a mighty good blacksmith . Well , everything went all right until one day some horse started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language to it . I mean that he started cussing that horse out . Of course , all the pious people that heard him jumped back as if boiling water was squirting into their ears . There was a powerful scandal about it , and they decided they would have to bring that blacksmith to trial and fine him a couple of hundred dollars and maybe order him thrashed at the hind end of a wagon . Well , it ai n't that easy to bluff a Pennsylvania Dutchman . Boosinger just up and told them that there was n't any way he knew about to talk down a horse unless it was cussing . He allowed that he had always cussed horses and he always would . Said he did n't mean anything blasphemous by it and did n't mean any slight either to the Almighty or the horse . It was just part of his trade . ' So , " he says , " if you 're a mind to punish me for cussing , I 'll just pay the fine and I 'll be out of here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lock , stock , and barrel , the whole blamed shooting match . And then you can shoe your own horses . " Well , sir , what did they do ? They passed a new law . They said that it was illegal for anybody to swear but a blacksmith , and the blacksmith could swear at horses while he was shoeing them , but he 'd better not forget himself any other time . So Boosinger stayed in Tallmadge. '  | When Lemuel turned in at the poolroom Charlie Puff himself was there , looking like his name , large and white and powdery . He was a plasterer along with running the poolroom , and he had just come in from a job . Elmer Jacobs , Lew Tildy , and Ernie Kappelmeister were shooting a game of French pool . Hello , bub , ' said Lew , how 's your liver ? ' Lemuel sat down on one of the high chairs with footrests . Ernie slammed the cue ball into the mess and two striped balls dropped into the pockets . Horseshoes , ' said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The trouble with you guys is that you do n't use no science , ' said Ernie . He addressed himself to Lemuel . It 's higher than I am and it 's in tassle . ' Elmer got the ten-ball , but he sank the cue ball with it . Indignantly , he lammed the floor with the butt of his cue . You do n't live right , ' said Lew . Lew drove the ball off the table . Over the fence is out , ' commented Lew . Hey , youse guys , ' whined Charlie Puff . Be a little careful how you handle the crockery . ' Go lay an egg , ' said Lew . Go peel a potato , ' said Elmer . Go comb your hair , ' said Ernie . Lemuel did n't want to be left out of it , so he said , Go peddle your milk . ' The four adults looked quickly at him . The kid is clever , ' said Lew . Too smart for his own good , ' said Elmer.  | He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' said Ernie . After they racked them up again and Ernie broke and managed to slop one in , Lew got thirsty , so he said , Hey , Charlie , see if you can rustle me up some lemon pop . ' Give me an egg phosphate , ' said Elmer . I 'll take my eggs scrambled , ' said Ernie . This struck Lemuel as being so funny that he laughed and laughed . He wished they would ask him to play . But they did n't . Over in the corner three old men were playing seven-up . Who dealed ? ' I think Abe dole , ' replied Century Fike . So Nelse dealt the cards . When he had the hands dealt he kept right on dealing . He was an absent-minded man . Century Fike flew into a temper , threw his cards into the middle of the table , stood up and said , Nelse , you 're just a fool . ' Nelse laughed . Hi , sp'norts ! ' Clyde yelled at the pool-players from the doorway . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many wells to make a river ? ' responded Clyde . As the two boys issued out the door Lew was saying , What 's the score ? ' Nothing to nothing , my favor , ' said Ernie . When the boys were getting into the buggy , Clyde commented to Lemuel , Just a bunch of sp'norts , in there . Gosh , it minds me of the first time I was ever in a saloon . That was something . It had to be a big brawl . So I never forgot it . I was only eight . ' Lemuel looked surprised . Uncle Simon , who never drank  | anything stronger than weak home-made wine , was n't the man to take his son to a saloon . The hired man we had then took me . He was George Lee , the one who had seven tumors on his head . A fellow told him he did n't have much sense , bringing a kid into a place like that . It was quite a fight , though . It was a funny place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're just kind of cool , dark places and usually the men around the bar just act mild and argue about things a little . But this place was packed with people and their voices was all confused . A woman patted my face . The hired man told her to let me alone . He said I was bashful ! She made a face , and she left me alone . The hired man ordered me some pop and peanuts and he had a glass of beer . All of a sudden two men stood up at the same time . Their chests were right together , and their eyes was shooting fire . " You take that back , " one of them said . The other one said , " I said it . You know it 's so . " " If you fellows want to fight , " the bartender told them ? that was just as the one was about to strike the other ? " come on out in back . No rough-house here . " So we all went out in the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stomach , from hearing the blows fall and from the smell of blood , but at the same time I kind of felt like yelling . I wanted to go , but still I wanted to stay . But the hired man stayed , so I did . That younger fellow was bleeding in one corner of his mouth . He would stop and smile at the people all around and say , " You think I 'm getting whipped , but I 'm all right . I 'm really all right . "  | The older man put up his fists and walked right up to him . So the younger one hit him , real hard , but kind of frantic , right on his birthmark . I forgot to tell you the older man had a great big , hand-sized birthmark on one side of his face that looked like South America . The older man did n't guard that . But he put one fist against his chest , and all of a sudden he cut out with it , and he chopped the young fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down as if his legs had been cut out from under him . Then the big one turned and said , " Bring me two whiskies ? one for the young fellow . " Since I knew more about fighting , ' added Clyde , I 've seen a lot of worse fights than that one ! ' They came to Ed Whitsamen on the road and they gave him a lift . He started to laugh when they got up to Gus Nusbaum 's place , so they asked why . He asked them if they noticed that the silo stood next to the hog yard , and they said , Sure . ' Well , that was how it happened , he told them , that one time some of the fermented juice ran out and intoxicated the hogs . He asked them if they knew the story of Gus 's goldfish . Clyde said he heard something about that , but did n't remember . Ed told them that over in the Nusbaums ' woods was a creek that widened out into a pool . It even had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone in to Kerriston and he saw a great big bowl of goldfish in the drugstore window . It was all lit up with a yellow light behind it , and they were some of the biggest goldfish you ever saw anyway , so Gus was thrilled . He took them home in a bucket , and the next morning he  | could hardly wait to get out there and dump them in among the water lilies . He admired them for a while , swimming around among the water lilies , and then he had to go for the cows . But when he came back they were gone , either from the sunfish chasing them , or maybe just from the go-fever . ' But they stopped under a bridge a half-mile down the creek . So the poor fellow spent two hours catching them with a mosquito-bar net . He put them back in the pool and they disappeared again . But the third time he first took them away up the creek and put them in , and that time they stopped at his pool . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had imagined it . The Goosetowners came out and you could hear them a halfmile away admiring the goldfish . They were almost back to Uncle Simon 's and Ed was going to get out at the crossroads . He was looking at the boys speculatively . Say , ' he asked , did I ever tell you about Reason Speedle 's horse , Xenophon ? ' The boys had never even heard of Reason Speedle , so they said no . Well , that was an example of what training can do . Xenophon was getting elderly . His strength was almost gone . Reason did n't feel like taking a dead loss on him , and figured on ways and means to make enough out of what was left of the horse to do a little swapping . The principal trouble with the horse was that he dragged his feet . Reason laid a row of fence-rails along in front of the barn and put a pair of magnifying spectacles on Xenophon . Then  | he made the horse walk over the rails . Well , sir , Xenophon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , and he hoisted up his feet like a Morgan thoroughbred hitched to a split-hickory buggy . Reason put him through that every day for two weeks and then he took the goggles off the horse . It worked . The horse kept lifting his feet like the whiskey soprano in the last act . It would have been a great idea , but the trouble of it was that it worked too well . The horse kept throwing his feet higher and higher , and one day he put out both his eyes by stepping in them . After that , there was trouble . Xenophon could n't see , but he kept imagining there was hurdles in front of him to step over . On the day the horse-trader visited Reason 's farm , the horse jumped over the tobacco barn while he was hitched to a sulky , and the trader would n't have anything to do with him . After that , Reason thought of making a team of it by buy-ing a kangaroo from a circus . But the danged horse got to stepping so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet every time he took a step , and run himself to do thinking Reason was pounding him with a block of cord-wood .... What do you boys think of that ? ' asked Ed . What I think of that , ' said Clyde , is horseshoes . ' Well , ' said Ed , of course that happened seventy-five , eighty years ago , and it was down ' round Coshocton . But a friend of mine told it to me for a fact . '  | C H A P T E R F I F T E E N THE BROTHERS LANDESMAN BEFORE the mailman came , things at Ora 's house were going along as usual . Ten minutes after the mailman came and left , Barbara and Amanda were flying around the house as if they were going to tear it down . Ora was cleaning his doublebarreled shotgun and his new four-shot automatic shotgun . Lemuel was hitching the light team to the surrey . The letter that caused all this sudden excitement was in an envelope postmarked Columbus , Ohio , ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weiler , Esquire . ' The letter was from Geoffrey Landesman , Barbara 's and Lemuel 's cousin who had been Ora 's room-mate during the time Ora spent in college . Ora read the letter , ejaculated , called his family together and read it aloud : Greetings and salutations he read from one who roamed with you the Appian Way and ate with you the Attic salt . Greetings also to the beautiful chatelaine of your Sabine villa and to the Heir of Weiler . Selah . These presents part from one of sound body and disposing mind who trusts that they find you and yours in the same state . And now that the amenities are served , let me come to the aim and purpose of this Epistle to the Kerristonians . Viz. , i.e. , namely and towit : For some time a strange passion has incubated within the manly bosom of my sober-sided brother Bayard . A glint has glowed in his eye ; meseemeth his lips draw back farther upon  | his teeth , which appear to have taken on a vulpine length and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of one so staid and dignified held us all bewildered , but the truth at last has come to light . He is ravening with a lust for the kill . He will not be happy until he has shed the innocent blood of a thousand harmless scampering rabbits . Thus has the curse of the House of Landesman descended upon its oldest son . As for me , you are aware of my chicken-heartedness . I would not slap a mosquito or twist the wrist of a lamb , and if a man-eating rabbit walked up to me with his ugly fangs bare and a baggonet in each fist , I would surrender to eternal serfdom rather than offer him either injury or slight . But I am , unfortunately , my brother 's keeper , and whither he goeth , there must I also in likewise go . Does a light dawn upon you , 0 partner of my model youth ? Are not your broad acres pediculous with hares and coneys which nibble your tender cabbages and snap at the ankles of your phlegmatic heifers ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a word , the invitation which you caused to stand . Unless your sentries turn us back at the border , we will be with you a-Wednesday , armed at all points and eager for the melee . Seriously , dear Ora , we 're both eager for a week or so at your place , if you and the lovely Barbara can stand us . Stow us anywhere . We can sleep in the haymow and sustain ourselves by the rabbits we shoot . Your humble and obedient servant , G. LANDESMAN There is a story about a girl who , with the help of a kind fairy , spun and wove I do n't remember how many bolts of linen cloth all in one night , and there is also a story about the wonders which the paragons of Charlemagne performed in one day at the court of Soldan.  | Barbara and Amanda did a lot in a short time , too , when they realized that the visitors were arriving that day to stay a week . The letter was a day late , and they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , Barbara and Amanda tore down the bed in which Ora and Barbara slept , moved it into the spare room alongside the spare bed , changed both beds , gave the room a thorough cleaning , got an old bed down out of the attic and set it up in Ora 's room , rearranged the furniture in the parlor , killed and dressed two chickens , put on clean clothes , and filled several vases with cockscombs and zinnias . Ora , meanwhile , had started for Kerriston to meet the train from Columbus . He pulled his leather boots on over his overalls , but he would n't put on his Sunday suit , in spite of Barbara 's recommendations . They 'll take me as they find me , ' he said . They know I 'm a farmer and not a dude . ' Lemuel was sent off to the Naugles ' place to get permission for the two brothers to hunt the big swamp . He was home again when Ora arrived with the visitors . Geoffrey rode in the front seat with Ora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several gun cases . Geoffrey , in fawn-colored box-back coat , checked peg-top trousers , and a pearl-gray , double-breasted vest , leaped over the wheel when the buggy stopped , bowed like a duke to Barbara , and swept the air with his shallow sailor hat , a lordly gesture . Most gracious madam , ' he said , you behold two weary and footsore wanderers seeking hospice at your gate . ' He straightened up and looked her full in the face . He whistled . Every time I see you , ' he said , you 're twice as beautiful as before . I 'll go home blinded . '  | Smiling gently , Bayard , in blue serge , got out of the surrey and came to press Barbara 's hand . You 're awfully kind to let us come , ' he said . We 're bound to be a nuisance . ' Bayard helped Lemuel put the horses away . Lemuel could n't think of anything to say and Bayard responded to his bashfulness . But Lemuel admired the skill with which he handled a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I guess you understand horses , ' Lemuel said finally . Bayard smiled , opened his mouth , decided not to speak , opened it again , and said , The fact is , I 've got a pacer I race . ' Gee whiz , ' said Lemuel . He still admired Geoffrey , but there was something about Bayard that instantly made him a friend . Geoffrey is a much better driver , ' said Bayard . Lemuel didn ' believe that . He had made up his mind in that moment that Bayard was the best racetrack driver in the world . The next morning Lemuel and Ora came in to breakfast when it was still dark , and Lemuel was surprised to see Bayard and Geoffrey at the table . Bayard was dressed in an old corduroy hunting suit such as anybody going hunting might wear . Geoffrey was wearing an astonishing costume with a red coat , green trousers , and a Bavarian hat with a feather . He was apparently so proud of the hat that he wore it to table . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to run up to him , grab him by the wrist , throw him down , sit on his head , and make him say " Uncle . " ' Ora , in his overalls , went hunting with them , to make them acquainted with the country around and introduce them to the farmers in whose woods and meadows they might hunt .  | Lemuel went out to plow the oats stubble . It was a cool and sunny day with a purple haze around the edges . Every now and then , Lemuel , between the plowhandles , heard gunfire off in the Naugle swamp . Once he caught a sight of Geoffrey 's red coat a mile away . In the middle of the forenoon , Amanda brought a jug of watered , sweetened wine , some bread , and some yellow cheese . She sat on the beam of the plow while Lemuel , who sat down on the lip of the furrow , ate his lunch . Is n't Geoffrey awful ? ' she said , in an admiring voice . He almost kills me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Bayard best , ' said Lemuel . Jealousy of Geoffrey welled up in his heart . When Lemuel came into the house at noon , Amanda was sitting on Geoffrey 's lap . She was struggling . He was holding her fast and trying to scrape her cheeks with his beardstubble . Lemuel abruptly walked out of the kitchen and took a long time washing his hands . He sat on the porch swing until Barbara called him to dinner . He was so silent at the table that Ora asked him what was wrong . A domesticated feline has absconded with his lingual organ , ' Geoffrey said . Lemuel said nothing was the matter . The Landesman brothers did not go hunting in the afternoon . Geoffrey changed his clothes and spent several hours lounging in the hammock on the front porch reading a novel . Bayard sat with Barbara in the swing in the side yard and brushed the flies off the baby , while they discussed the younger Lemuel 's future . Then Bayard walked out into the field where Lemuel was plowing and sat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasoline tractors which he had seen at the State Fair . In a few years , ' he said , you 'll have to be an engineer instead of a horseman . ' In the evening they all went to Milton Center to call on the Brisenstines . All but Lemuel . He stayed home and rescued an imaginary Amanda from a dozen imaginery perils in each of which the villain was a dude who used big words and talked too much . Geoffrey 's perfidy seemed worse when he remembered that the poet was as good as engaged to lovely Bess Brisentine . As the week progressed Lemuel 's jealousy of Geoffrey did not diminish . Mornings the brothers hunted , and afternoons Geoffrey hung around the house gallanting the women . Bayard spent his afternoons with Ora and Lemuel . He got well enough acquainted with the way things were done to take a hand . It did not matter to Lemuel that Geoffrey was just as flirtatious with Barbara as he was with Amanda . The fact that he was flirtatious with Amanda at all was enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur to him to be jealous about Barbara . Lemuel was plowing stubble on the afternoon of the day before the Landesman brothers were to leave . For a halfhour he had been watching for Amanda to come back the lane to bring him his mid-afternoon lunch . When she finally appeared , Geoffrey was walking with her . Or not exactly with her . He was gamboling all around her , like a frisky calf or something . He made Lemuel sick . Instead of waiting for them , Lemuel made another round so they 'd have to wait for him .  | Hail , youth , ' said Geoffrey , when Lemuel came back on the other side of the land . Hello , ' said Lemuel . Geoffrey struck a sudden attitude , pointed a finger at Lemuel , and cried : Go prick thy face , thou lily-livered boy . Where gottest thou that goose look ? ' He relaxed then and said : That 's Shakespeare . Pretty elegant , is n't it ? ' Hot and cold spells were chasing up and down Lemuel 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look here . ' Remember , ' said Geoffrey , a soft answer turneth away wrath . Come , fair one . Let us wander in the grove while the youth munches his crust of cheese . ' Amanda looked at Lemuel as much as to say , The situation is out of my hands , ' and went with Geoffrey . For a moment Lemuel stood , gritting his teeth and breathing through them . Geoffrey and Amanda were walking across the plowed ground , Geoffrey holding her arm . Lemuel yanked the lines off his back , threw down his poleand-whang whip , and started running after them . His feet felt awkward and the plowed ground tried to trip him , but an insane fury carried him on . He picked up a big clod of earth and threw it . It hit Geoffrey in the back , between the shoulders . Geoffrey halfturned , half-stumbled , but did not fall down . Amanda screamed . Lemuel stopped dead in his tracks , horrified , sure that in that instant of unexpected and terrible impulse , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt of his ear . He looked ridiculous , he was so astonished . He rubbed at the ear a  | moment , turning to look at Lemuel with wide eyes . He had nothing whatever to say . Amanda stood quietly , wringing her hands . After an instant she took a step toward Lemuel . Then she started running toward him , crying , looking as if she wanted to pat his head or do something else motherly and consoling . Lemuel turned abruptly and ran toward the barn . He ran in by the feeding-aisle door , and Ora 's old hound rose from a bed of hay to welcome him . The calf looked at him solemnly a moment , then cut a caper . Seeing that the boy was weeping and in agony , the dog sneaked away , its tail pressed into its crotch , its spine undulating and its face wretched with guilt and fear . The calf stood still with its feet braced forward , leaped into the air again , and swung its tail in a circle . Lemuel climbed the peg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belly in the hay . The thin , hard stalks prickled him ; he enjoyed the hurt . The yellow cat came near and nudged Lemuel 's foot . Lemuel kicked her away gently . Go away , cat , ' he said . Go away and do n't never come back . ' After a while he quit weeping . He saw the daylight coming through the narrow vertical slits between the boards of the wall . It made a furry band of radiance about three times as wide as the slit . He found that when he closed his eyes he saw rainbows through his tears . Now and then he still had a thrust of hatred at the thought of Geoffrey and his dude ways and dude clothes . When he did , he dug his fingernails into his hands and growled in his throat .  | After a while he heard Geoffrey 's voice , and instantly he lay still as a stone . Fever and chills ran up and down his spine , and his insides convulsed at every pulse . But he did not move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiffened , and then he started to cry again . He had never been so lonely in his life , but he did not want to see any human face . He began to make his plans , how he would steal away as soon as it was dark enough to go without being seen . He would go through the clover field and then the timber . He would get to the slag road , and then catch a ride to Grandma Nadeli 's . He would tell her that he wanted to go home a week early , in order to get all ready for school . When it started to grow dark Lemuel suddenly heard Ora 's voice just inside the door . He moved resolutely into the darkest corner . He kept his back turned . Hey , Lem , we 're going to eat now . Come on . ' No , thank you , ' Lemuel whispered . I wo n't eat in that kitchen any more . ' Ach , do n't be silly . The Landesmans have gone home , and Jeff mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was sorry he had been such an ass . You know , he does n't mean any harm . ' At the word harm ' Lemuel started to weep . Then he was silent . Ora started to say something , but Lemuel broke in stiffly . I just want to say , ' he said , that I 'm not coming into the house any more . I can stay in the barn tonight , and tomorrow I 'll walk to the station and get my train . Or I 'll walk to Grandma 's . ' Is n't that sort of mean to us ? ' Well , nobody decent would do a thing like I did . I do n't belong here . I do n't know how to act . '  | Now , what an idea ! ' said Ora . When a person has learned a lesson , he has . He can spend a thousand years punishing himself , but he wo n't know it any better . Where 's the good in that ? Besides , what about your Uncle Simon ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guess you did n't know he 's been dickering to buy the old Whonsettler place , just with the idea of getting it in shape so you can have it to farm when you grow up . Seems like it 'd be a big waste to go back to New York mad at a time like this . ' Less you 're going to get dudish and stay away from Wayne County altogether . ' Lemuel was sitting up . Golly ! ' he said . You ai n't kidding , Ora ? ' Word of honor , ' said Ora , and as Lemuel leaned out where he could see him , he saw that Ora smiled a big friendly smile . Lemuel began to scramble down from the haymow . We 'd better get in there and quick eat , ' added Ora . There 's a couple of extra chores I 'd like you to help with before it gets too dark . '  | CHAPTER SIXTEEN TAKE COWS DRAMA is as necessary to human health and happiness as food . It is because of this that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each other 's actions . If you know a person well enough , the ordinary events of his day are interesting . A woman , by applying what she knows about a neighborhood situation to the fact that a certain man left a certain house at a certain time , construes from that fact something which satisfies her sense of the dramatic . A scholar in history , co-ordinating his information about the rise and fall of civilizations , constructs from the action of a certain emperor a new note on the Hittite culture . The delight which invests them is the same . The woman deals in gossip about her neighbors . The historian 's interest is in gossip about ancient realms and dynasties . But gossip there must be . No man can be happy without it . It is the city dweller 's belief that there is not much to gossip about upon a farm , that makes him think farm life is lonely . To the person who has never lived upon an American farm it seems plausible that a place where only five persons ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to week without seeing much of the outside world must be a pretty uninteresting place . The point which is overlooked is this : On a farm , the animals become characters in the drama .  | There is gossip about the cows and the horses and the hogs and the hens . The three-color cat that for more than a month has spent all her spare time in the manger of the little black yearling bull has deserted her old friend . She spends her afternoons now lying on the barn-bank watching the swallows . The bay mare named Kate is having trouble with collar galls again . The rooster named Dennis has started picking on the rooster named Weary Willie again . Hallie , the gaunt old cow , got mixed up with bumblebees that had a nest in a rotten fencepost when she leaned against the post trying to reach a clump of grass beyond the fence . Such matters are the grist of gossip on the farm . This may seem uninteresting to those persons who do not know that every individual animal has its individual character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals on the farm ? are to be told apart . One reacts differently from another under similar circumstances . At Ora 's , for instance , Lemuel discovered that it was pleasant to listen to all the various languages of the clucks . They talked to themselves in a cheerful sing-song voice . Then they 'd interrupt this suddenly to call the peeps together when they found a particle of food . This call was maternal and urgent and indulgent , all at the same time . When Pridie , the dog , trotted past , the clucks called the chicks in with an entirely different call . The inflection was frantic and loaded with terror . And when a rooster , in a near-by lot , spotted a hawk , he gave the long-drawn-out squawk of alarm , and the clucks joined in taking it up . Lemuel  | learned , too , that if he went near the front of the coops , the clucks would talk to him threateningly . One day he saw a strange cat which had recently come to the barn . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had run away . She was lean and watchful . When anyone came near , she hid under the barn . She would not come near the little wooden trough in which Lemuel set milk for her under the barn , as long as anybody was watching . But in a few hours , the trough would be dry . For a number of days Lemuel saw the cat only at a distance , among the hogs . He climbed into the haymow and watched her through a crack . She had made friends with the pigs . Her tail lashing about like a snake , she rubbed affectionately against the fat shoats . They liked it and stood still as long as she cared to keep it up . The old sow , when the cat began rubbing her , lay down and enjoyed the petting luxuriously . Lemuel knew , from the cat 's actions , that she would be very friendly in a few days . She wanted affection , but she would n't trust human beings just yet . Maybe the ring around her tail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ora told him why it was that his old white dog , Jack , acted the way he did . One time a hired man had thrown a cannoncracker which had just been lit and the dog ran to retrieve it . Luckily it exploded before he got it in his mouth , but he never retrieved another stick . When anyone threw one he gave the person a sad , grieved look as if to say , You are trying to play a dirty trick on me . ' As Lemuel got acquainted with the animals he learned that the things that happened to them had the same interest , the same humor , the same pathos as would any information about a friend .  | Take Schumacher , that old rip of a cow who never had a kind look for anyone . She was stubborn ? the cow that made trouble when the herd was being put through a gate that was usually kept closed . But she was one of the best milkers . When she was fresh Ora had to make two trips to the aereator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to get into the barn all at once ( and there was always some confusion , afterward , from one or another forgetting where she belonged ) , Schumacher always required two persons to get her inside . This usually included Ora , to chase her , and Lemuel , to head her off . If she was n't headed off , she would go around the strawstack until her pursuer gave up and called for help . Two children could get her into the barn ; but the most adroit genius in the world could not have done it alone . One night Ora was doing the chores alone . After he had chased Schumacher around the stack a half-dozen times , he got mad . All right , you old fool , ' he said . You can just stay out , if you want to . ' At three o'clock in the morning her full udder began bothering her . She began to bellow . Ora had to rise and put her into the barn and milk her . When he got to the barnyard he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll act more sensible from now on , you old black fool . ' He opened the barn door . Schumacher stood and looked at him . He got behind her and urged her forward . Still lowing a little from the pain of her fullness , she broke into a run and started going around the strawstack . Ora had to call Lemuel to help him get her in.  | Schumacher , while the rest of the cows gathered in the heat of the day to stand in the shallow water in the shade of the clump of sycamores , would be off at the other side of the pasture , thinking her own thoughts , pursuing her own affairs . When the herd returned voluntarily to the barn , she stayed behind and had to be fetched . In contrast was the Holstein cow named Steiner . She was mottled white and bluish gray . She got her name from the man from whom , as a calf , she had been bought . At first she was called the Steiner Heifer . ' The name inevitably shortened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was always the last one to start bawling when they were fed late . Hallie was a kicker . She was half-brindle , half-Guernsey , and as tough as a baseball player . She took a nasty pleasure out of waiting until the pail was almost full , and then putting her dirty old foot into it . When she was lammed for this , she did not take it in the submissive bovine fashion , but glared at the chastiser with personal hatred , and tried to reach him with her hoofs . Fanny was just a cow ? a plain , old-fashioned , simple cow . She was perfectly docile and perfectly stupid . She was never any bother at all . She gave a medium amount , and was about medium easy to milk . When town girls wanted to try their hands at milking , they were always told to practice on Fanny . Since Lemuel was n't a natural milker , Ora let him milk either Fanny or Steiner , but not any of the other cows . Jersey was a Jersey-grade cow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a human being , she would have been a fussy , dowdy old fat dame . Nothing ever suited her . No matter  | how you sat down to her , she had to fidget about it . She batted her tail around as badly in winter as she did in the fly season . When she broke her leg and had to be hoisted in a sling , she was positively hysterical . Ora had had to be up with her the better part of the night . Milly was just a few months removed from heiferhood , and she was still more or less of the flapper type . She liked to cut up ; she was mischievous . When she was turned out , she put her tail straight up and scampered . She was very fond of being petted , and she would not stand still to be milked unless affection were first showered upon her . Brindle was a different type of heifer , self-important and rakish , and with her nose in things that did not concern her . In general she acted like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to the edge of the fence to see what was going on . Once when she did this , Ora had thrown a firecracker near her . When it banged , she turned tail and ran so fast that it seemed her hips were likely to vault clear over her head . As for Nelly , it was odd that such a ranting English dowager of a cow should have been given a sweet and gentle name . She admitted no law save that of her inclination . Schumacher was stubborn and sardonic , but predictable ; Nelly was a headstrong old rebel . She jumped fences until Ora put a rope around her neck and fastened it to a fence-rail that dragged between her legs and caught in any fence she tried to jump . Then she began poking her long neck through fences , and he had to put on her a wooden collar studded with nails that would prick her if she leaned against it . Unconquered , she leaned deliberately against the nails and hurt herself until he took it off again . She led the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through sheer contempt , and despised the others for following her . Once , when there was an accident to Ora 's buggy when he and Barbara were away in the spring and they did n't get around to milking until ten at night , she was the only cow that was n't bellowing . She held the pain of her swollen udder in scorn , as she held in scorn the man who relieved her of it . After the cows were all in their stalls , Lemuel would go among them passing his arms around their necks to catch the chains that were fastened to the mangers . Forgetting their grievances the cows rubbed him with boisterous friendliness and he smelled their sweet breaths .  | C H A P T E R S E V E N T E E N THE YELLOW WAGON WHEN the time came to make apple-butter , they called on Lydia Graf . She was as good a specialist in her field as old Anton Mikolashek was at trimming grapes and directing the work ; or as Jeff Fike was in building a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cider mill , Ora insisted that the homemade kind was better . So he found when Lydia could spare a day . He borrowed Uncle Simon 's thirty-gallon copper kettle . He had two large iron kettles , but apple-butter called for copper . Ora set this up on a standard made of a wagon-wheel tire and three legs . This held the kettle far enough from the ground to allow for a wood fire underneath . Lydia had sent word by Ora that Barbara and Amanda should have sixteen gallons of sliced apples ready . Aunt Jen came the day before and helped with the apple-cutting . Lydia had also spoken for eighteen gallons of cider and twenty-five pounds of sugar . She arrived while they were still eating breakfast , a plump , twinkle-eyed woman with a very clean dress and a very clean apron . Her first act was to inspect the kettle . I always trust a man 's job of scrubbing about as far as you can throw a cow , ' she said . Nevertheless , she had to admit that the kettle was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteen gallons of cider . Then he started the fire underneath . He used stovewood  | and chopped fence-rails for fuel , and straw and corncobs for tinder . The kettle was slow in getting started . It was two hours before the cider had boiled down to the notch on the measuring stick . They skimmed it every now and then with a big ladle . They put in the sliced apples , when the cider had boiled down far enough . They did not put them in all at once , but a couple of quarts at a time . This was because they did not want to cool off the boiling mixture , and because they did n't want it to boil over . When it started boiling high Lydia tossed in a chunk of butter , and it promptly calmed down . It seems , ' she said , that the cider is a little wilder this year . ' All the while Lemuel and Ora and Amanda took turns in stirring the cider and feeding the fire . They stirred with the oddest spoon in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the hoe part six or eight inches wide , near two feet long , and bored full of holes . After the sliced apples were all in , it took seven hours to boil down . They got ten gallons of apple-butter . I 'd hate to think , ' said Lemuel to Barbara and Amanda , that I 'd have to go back , and stay always , where the weather does n't mean anything . ' They were peeling apples for canning . Barbara and Amanda were peeling by hand ; Lemuel was using a contraption which rotated the apple and shaved off its skin , but not very thoroughly . Does n't it mean so much in the city , then ? ' Amanda asked gently .  | Fall comes and you do n't know it , ' Lemuel replied . I never knew how much difference there is between August and September till I came here . ' It was going for ' fall , all right . It was sunny , but there was nothing brilliant or sparkling about the sunlight . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the look in a benign old drunkard 's blue eyes . All around the edge of the world there was a smoky haze . It merged in with the low , faraway , dim , sulphurous cloudbanks . The equinoctial rains had n't begun yet ? the slow , steady rains that last from day to day , holding night an hour overtime and making it evening all afternoon . But there had already been a hint of their coming in a half-day of steady rain ? not showers , but rain . The grass was heavy with dew early in the evening and in the morning it was wet long after sunup . Lemuel had seen the apple trees in bloom . Now he saw them loaded with apples ? apples so big that it seemed a miracle they could have grown from blossom to fruit in so few weeks . Boat-shaped segments of hickory-nut husks lay under the shagbarked trees and the chestnuts had dropped a few immature burrs . Lemuel had seen the willow trees turn from green to yellow from one day to the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every night there was a smell of skunk in the air . Day and night , there was a faint perfume of smoke and a sickly-sweet reek of flowers rotting . It was not often that Lemuel saw a bird by itself . They had gathered together in small bands . The small bands were uniting to make big ones . Then two big clouds of birds had gone over .  | But the change was more than a mere change of details . The whole idea of things had changed . It was n't exactly sadness , although the old women always talked of fall as being the sad time . It was more a matter of loneliness . Those who could not bear loneliness turned their backs on the outside world and found brightness and cheer inside . But Lemuel knew that there were those who loved it , and he himself felt the good of it . He somehow understood that what the hunter was hunting was not a coatful of dead things but the autumnal need of solitude . Only the next day Lemuel saw how a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the night he heard the rain fingering the window beside his bed ; he could hear it drumming on the metal roof of the one-story wing . He lay a while with the darkness cool against his eyes , and then the rain put him to sleep . When he woke again , it was daylight and still raining . The light was so wan that he could not tell whether it was late or early . He lay waiting for the sounds of Ora 's rising , which were his getting-up signal . In the gray light he could see water streaming down the window . A fringe of dribbles hung from the outer sash at the window 's middle . Over the unceasing small rumble of the rain he heard the lyric chanting of the water in the downspout . It felt good to lie in bed . He heard Ora and Barbara talking in low tones . They were staying abed late because of the rain . Later , a mist rose from the sodden ground . Between the mist and the rain , the world became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you could not see to the next farm . Ora and Lemuel sat just inside the wide-open doors of the  | horse-barn , oiling the work harness . The pungent smell of the oil mingled with the barn smells . The sleepy cat lay on top of the feedbox as gracefully as if a sculptor had arranged her . Now and then she opened her mystic eyes a moment , then closed them again . The dog Pridie wrenched at the sleeve of an old blue shirt which was hung on a nail as a waste rag . Now and then the horses took a streak of stamping their feet and fluttering their lips . The baby , lying in his padded wash-basket , chatted with the downspout gurgle , which spoke a language he understood better than the human tongues . Ora 's old dog lay pressed against the kitchen screen door . He would have liked to be inside . The wet wood Lemuel brought in steamed in the woodbox behind the stove . When they had finished oiling the harness , Lemuel and Ora went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While Ora started a fire in the forge , Lemuel helped himself from the hazelnut sack . He took the nuts from their frilly hulls and cracked them on the anvil . After the fire was going briskly , Lemuel worked the bellows while Ora heated the broken ends of the rod . He heated them until they began to throw off stars . The forge was near the door , and the stars flew out into the rain . While Ora was hammering the welded place , Barbara and Amanda came running out holding coats over their heads . Amanda carried some tiny loaves of bread fresh from the oven and Barbara had a yellow pitcher of blue buttermilk . The bread , when it was opened , breathed sweet perfume into the air that was laden with the clean and urgent smells of fire and metal . They spread the soft bread with butter that  | melted from its warmth and ate it sitting on nail kegs and boxes . They drank the sharp , tingling buttermilk and they munched hazelnuts which Lemuel cracked for them . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way as to show how strong he was . Ora took down an old rusty mouth-organ that was stuck in with some coldchisels and played Turkey in the Straw ' and Home , Sweet Home . ' It was three o'clock in the afternoon , and it had rained all day . But though it was gray-dark outside they felt a festivity that lasted all evening . Their lanterns bobbed merrily as , booted and wearing old coats , they went to the barn to milk . The cows were glad to be inside . They said so in soft lows , hardly heavier than sighs . Steam rose from their hides . They pushed the extra rations of chopfeed around in their mangers with their slippery noses , they licked their faces with long and agile tongues . The young owl in the comb of the barn batted the big eyes on his poker face . After the barn work was done , they hung their wet coats in the boarded-in back porch and kicked off their boots . Lemuel and Ora put on sheepskin slippers and the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in getting supper , and because they were all so gay , Barbara brought up a can of that year 's strawberries . As they sat around the stove that evening Ora surprised everybody , and perhaps even himself , by telling them of the time he had had to whip his father , Ezra Weiler . What ! ' shrieked Barbara . Now , Ora , you never did anything of the kind . ' Oh , yes , I did , ' said Ora . And I never thought much
