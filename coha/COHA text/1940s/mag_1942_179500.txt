" Buck Byrd rides again , " cracked Washington newshawks . Down the warpath , sure enough , padded Economizer Harry Byrd of Virginia , his apple cheeks stained winesap-red with indignation . He was still after the scalp of OCD ; and he was hot on the trail . He had discovered that OCD had still stranger captives in its tepee than Dancer Mayris Chancy ( resigned ) . <P> OCD , it seemed , had appointed 62 " coordinators " in its Physical Fitness Division-coordinators for such physically fitting sports as Ping-pong , Codeball , * archery , paddle tennis , marbles , canoeing , horseshoe pitching . <P> Acidly Senator Byrd remarked the fact that Chicago 's Jack M. Willem had been made coordinator of bowling . Icily he claimed : " Mr. Willem , as national bowling coordinator , I understand , is authorized to undertake a national campaign to recruit 25,000,000 men , women and children for regular attendance at bowling alleys . Mr. Willem has been identified to me as an executive of the Stack-Goble Advertising Agency , which handles the account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds a virtual monopoly on the manufacture of bowling alleys , balls and pins . " <P> OCDirector James M. Landis set up the pins again as if nothing had happened . No Federal cash , he pointed out , was being spent on the bowling project . Oh , no ? said the Senator , whizzing one down for a strike ; well , what about those red-white- &-blue; posters being turned out by the Government Printing Office , urging U.S. citizens to " keep them rolling , hit the headpin with Uncle Sam ? " Director Landis left the pins lying , retired to think that one over . <P> At this point , Franklin Roosevelt put in a word . " I believe that the war effort will not be hampered , but actually improved by sensible participation in healthy recreational pursuits . It must be borne in mind , however , that ' recreation as usual ' is just as bad as ' business as usual . ' " <P> The New York Herald Tribune straightway called for a coordinator of crapshooting ; the New York Daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had reason to think that he had been handed a tough job . <P> But perhaps happier days were ahead . The Fitness Division was taken over by Paul McNutt 's Federal Security Administration . Soon , perhaps , the Office of Civilian Defense could concentrate on civilian defense . <P> <P> * Coordinator is the game 's inventor : Dr. William E. Code of Chicago . Codeball is played with six-inch rubber balls ; has two forms : Codeball-on-the-Green is like golf , except that the ball is kicked into 14 specially constructed " bowls " covering about a mile and a quarter in one round . Codeball-on-the-Court is played , also with the feet , on a handball court .
