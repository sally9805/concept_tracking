The , current two-year agreement covering 450,000 soft coal miners expires March 31. iithe proposed agreement is to be for one year only . The union asked also the inclusion in the new agreement of 50,000 foremen , assistant foremen and other supervisory employes of coal mines heretofore excluded . The inclusion of these employes in the proposed new agreement and the wage demands constitute the two principal proposals of the union . The wage demand includes , an increase of 85 cents a day above the basic rise for workers re- , ceiving substandard wages , such ' as greasers , trappers , flaggers , switch throwers and slate pickers . The present basic wage rate for miners is $7 a day . For laborers it is $5.08 a day . Demands similar to those presented yesterday to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before operators organized in the Southern Coal Producers Association and representing mines employing 135,000 of the 450,000 soft coal miners of the country. ? The agreement , : to be concluded for the Appalachian region , north and south , will serve as bases for contracts in the outlying , bituminous regions of the West and Middle West . The northern mine owners , organized in the Appalachian Joint Wage Conference , employ 200,0001 men . In presenting the union 's de ; mends before a joint meeting of the union 's international policy committee and of the mine owners , John L. Lewis , president of the United Mine Workers , declared that while the union hoped to obtain a new agreement without a strike , it was determined to gain the two-dollar increase ? " $2 , not any more and not any less . " " We are not trying to sugarcoat anything , " he said . " I want to break the news so that the War Labor Board can hear it .

" The coal miners of America are hungry , " Mr. Lewis said . " They are ill-fed and undernourished below the standard of their neighbors and other citizens . " Mr. Lewis declared frankly that the United Mine Workers was determined to break the Little Steel wage formula of the War Labor Board fixing real wages at the rates prevailing Jan. 1 , 1941 , and assailed the government 's wage elle price control policy as contrasted with the cost-plus system of measuring payments on war contracts to industry as a policy of " fattening industry and starving labor .

" Americans are not fighting this war to give a corporation patent attorney like Mr. Davis the power of life and death over millions of workers and their families in this industry . The world knows that Mr. Davis has long had his knife out waiting to plunge it into the back of the United Mine Workers . He inserted it into its body three times in 1941 and is now waiting to do it in 1943 . Well , he just is n't going to do it this time . The War Labor Board seemingly has not yet found out that the workers of this - Country , and particularly the coal miners do not intend to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Lewis 's attack on the War Labor Board and his suggestion that it wculd perform a constructive service by resigning  --  a suggestion addressed particularly to the labor members of the board , whom he termed " labor zombies " ? followed his disclosure of the existence in Washington of a Building Trades Wage Stabilization Board , created as an arm of the WLB , which , Mr. Lewis charged , had been quietly grant* wage increases to A. P. of L. building tradesmen above the 15 per ce , , t , wage formula . According to Mr. Lewis , the Building Trades Wage Stabilization Board has granted wage scales ranging from $1.25 to $1.75 an hour , " breaking the Little Steel formula with impunity and without publicity . " " The Building Trades Wage Stabilization Board does not make public its decisions and these facts are unknown to the public or to other government agencies , " Mr. Lewis charged . " That is the way Mr. Davis protects the public from infla ion . I suggest that some enthusiastic member of Congress look into this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " not exorbitant " but " modest and conservative . " Mr. Lewis said : " The mine workers live remote from the cities . They are the victims of social and economic exploitation . Their living costs are higher , and their social standards are lower because of their vulnerability to this exploitation . It will be proven in this conference that the wages of the mine . worker are lower than exist in any - other essential war-time industry . This is true when computed either on a daily , weekly or annual basis . " Mr. Lewis read eight closely packed pages of statistics prepared by the union on the rise of living costs in the mine districts through-1 out the country as well as : figures showing the earnings of corporations . He warned also that because of the lower wage and living stand-1 ards prevailing in the mining industry there has been a large exodus of miners in many districts into war plants , where wages are considerably higher , saying that this tendency could be arrested only by the wage increase proposed by the miners ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was devoted to an analysis of the other demands of the union , covering improvements in working conditions and vacations with pay , and to a discussion of the problem of inflation . On the latter subject he took the position that inflation was already here as a consequence of the government 's gigantic spending for war purposes . Other demands presented by Mr. Lewis included retention of the present basic thirty-five-hour fiveday week , with elimination of the existing emergency six-day week at the conclusion of the war ; amendment of present hours provisions by establishing the portal-to-portal practice for starting and quitting time ' for underground workers ; time and one-half for overtime and double time for ' Sunday ; an increase in vacation payments to $50 a week from the present $20 token payments ; elimination of existing wage differentials within and between districts ; and operation of only two instead of three shifts within a given twenty-four hours , as a means of eliminating hazards and improving safety conditions .

An attempt by Mr. Lewis to obtain the admission into the wage . conference of coal companies in Illinois and Indiana , with a tonnage of 65,000,000 and employing 50,000 miners , failed when the operators , invoking the unit rule of the conference , voted in opposition . Ezra Van Horn , executive vice president of the Ohio Coal Operators Association , was elected unanimously chairman of the wage conference , with Thomas Kennedy , secretary-treasurer of the United Mine Workers , secretary . The conference will reconvene this morning , when Charles O'Neill , spokesman for the operators , will present their ' reply to the union 's demands .
