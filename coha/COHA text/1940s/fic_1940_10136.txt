" Well , he was saying  --  " " That 's what I was going to ask you soon as I got around to it . What was he saying to you yesterday when I come up ? You did n't look too pleased . " " Did n't I ? There was n't anything . And I did n't mean we were saying anything in particular , either . Only that he talked as if ' he intended to stay . " " Well , he did , if he left everything like he did . " " Of course . " " Funny now . 1 thought you acted sore . I asked him what it was . " Ray waited . " But . he only said you were a nice kid . Guess I was cockeyed . " " I really do n't remember . " " Lena says I 'm nuts to bother about him yet awhile . " " Been goin ' to too many movies , " put in Lena over her shoulder . " Morning , Ray . I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same class with the Death House of the Great Plains . " " Tell him what that was , Lena . " " Oh , it 's a story I heard when I was a girl , and I happened to tell it to Dutch one night lately when something like it happened in the movies . Not much like it , though . Would n't go in the movies . Why , there was a family named something or other kept a house where pioneers stopped overnight , or maybe prospectors going west . When one of these birdsP101looked like he had money on him they 'd put him at the table where if he leaned back his head would make a dent in a curtain that hung there instead of a wall . You know . Pioneer house . On the other side of course the dent would be something else . A knob . And back there 'd be the old man or maybe one of his boys with an ax . They could n't miss , and the cellar got full of bones finally . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighed and shook his head . " It was . How were they discovered ? " " Too many people disappeared , and somebody was traced . I heard it from my dad . His dad was out there at the time . But I tell Dutch he 's got Death House on the brain . " " I do n't see , Lena , " said Ray . " Well , he calls this a disappearance . I do n't yet , but he does . And he seems to think there 'll be trouble about it , and maybe people wo n't stop here any more . " " Oh , " said Ray . " But you think the permanent will come back . " " Why not ? " Lena was at the bottom of the carton now , and its contents were strewn along the counter . " Leastways I do n't find any reason for thinking he wo n't . He has n't been away that long . " " No . Just a night . " " Just a night . And I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent it . A handsome sport like that  --  well , you could n't say . " " All the same , " said Dutch from the chair into which he had settled , " I 'm goin ' to notify . " " The  --  the police ? " Ray stumbled over the question . " Why not ? Have you got any objection ? " " It 's our business , Dutch . Leave Ray alone . I 'll say again that if you want to work up some notoriety this is the way to do it . Anybody 'd think you 'd be the one to wait till there was something to put out . Do n't you think so , Ray ? " " Look lure , Lena . You said to leave him out of it . Said it was our business . Maybe it 's mine . " " I do n't know what you mean by business , big boy , but if this camp 's a business remember it 's half mine . I knew there 'd come a time when you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , and I 'm saying  --  where you going , Ray ? " " I 'll make the rounds while  --  " " While what ? While we fight it out ? Do n't blame you a damn bit . " It was lucky , thought Ray as he left headquarters behind him , that there had been no opportunity to agree with Lena . Of course he would have wanted to say : Do n't send for the police yet , let another day pass . And another , and another , and another . There was no hurry about the police . Yet in one sense there was . For if they shouldp103come , and after an examination of Windless find nothing suspicious at all , then something would be over . Not much , maybe , but something ; and after that it might be possible to think less often of what had happened , and to face , more practically than before , a future away from Windless  --  at which he flushed , for the future did not belong to him yet , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other place than this one which he knew too well . It might be possible ? But all the while the rate at which he thought of the man in his grave seemed to accelerate , so that whereas in the last minute he had thought of him ten times he was sure that the next count would be a hundred . And he could see no end to the progression . Nevertheless he had to hope that Lena 's opinion would prevail , at least for the remainder of the day . She had n't said she would hold out forever , so he could n't count on tomorrow . And there might very well come a time when Lena would be more dangerous to him than Dutch , since she was more intelligent . Meanwhile , though , she stood between him and something he chose not to see , and he would pray for strength in her to remain there . The voices of the pair followed him as far as to the bathhouse . Beyond that he could not hear them , and the silence grew immense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the tracks in the grass where cars had backed out within an hour , the innocent stray bits of paper which children had unwrapped from their candy and thrown down to blow along the drive  --  these things were eloquent concerning the regularity with which the night had passed for the most part . There had been only one exception , and Ray tried desperately not to consider that . Down at the end of the drive the rear of a car was still visible , awl in the last . cabin there was no tumbled bed to say that a man had rested in it and gone on . There was really no need yet to consider Number 2o , with almost a dozen cabins up here to put in order , with grass to trim , with that broken swing to mend , with the water pails to fill , with the tools to straighten up in the tool house where some of them had fallen ( the spade would be dry now , but he would look at it anyway before he placed it behind the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with  --  oh , there were plenty of things to do besides poke into a cabin where he had no business to be . He could make himself useful at the pumps for that matter , pretending he realized the importance of a free mind for Dutch so that this new problem could be pondered . Who was he , Ray , but Dutch and Lena 's helper ? His role was to be considerate yet unobtrusive . The two of them would be grateful to him then , and be less disposed to think of any possible connection between him and the matter which perplexedthem . He was sure that Dutch had been satisfied by hisp105report of yesterday 's conversation with the man . Then , with a swiftness which showed how closely it had been hovering there all the while , came back to him the sentence : He only said you were a nice kid . And flying in the wake of this came Lucy 's words : It does n't seem anything now  --  anything at all . He knew suddenly how deep the impression made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard them to let them pass , or seem to pass ; but they had not passed , and he was saying to himself now that it was for nothing he had done last night 's incredible , immeasurable deed . He had killed a man who said he liked him , and whose existence for Lucy did n't seem anything now  --  anything at all . Of course the man had said what he said to Dutch for a certain reason . Yet the most sinister reason which Ray could imagine was pale in this new daylight . And the probability that Lucy had minimized her own fears  --  even this was far from the certainty which would help him so much were it capable of being cherished . The incredible , immeasurable deed had not been necessary . With no justification at all he had taken a life  --  the words rattled in his ears , unreal and terrible  --  andruined his peace of mind ; and someday Lucy 's . For he was deathly afraid that she would know , and he was deathly certain that his excuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet she must not know . His business was not top106remember the man . Or even himself . It was to keep her from knowing . He said it sickly to himself as the day passed , and as it became gradually clear that Dutch had given in to Lena concerning the police . Whatever happened tomorrow , today was Ray 's own , with an immense silence protecting him and torturinghim all around . Even the obligation disappeared to put time in at Number 20 . Dutch 's excess of cautioninspired him to announce that everything must be left just as it was , not merely because the belongingsof a guest should he free from disturbance but also because , iii case the worst had happened , and it was obvious that Dutch was fascinated by the thought , the effects of the victim must not have been touched before the law 's arrival . So the day passed without anyone 's discovering the man 's name anywhere among the articles which filled his room ; and without anything on Ray 's part beyond the minimum gesture betokening interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabin would seem more remarkable to Dutch and Lena than his haunting it too much , he strolled there in the late afternoon , pulled open the screen door with an affectation of indifference , and darted in . But he was out again almost immediately , with a crowd of after-images swarming at the back of his brain and threatening to remain there : the neckties like gorgeousnooses suspended from a rusty hook , the glitteringrazor in its open case , the lotions on the shelfp107beneath the mirror , the red dressing gown in its careless pose across a chair , and the two suits whose shoulders stood out so naturally on their nickel hangers . His business was to keep Lucy from knowing , the silence said . But as the time for their meeting approached the insistence took another form . It must not be at the spring . He could not meet her there this night , whatever courage he might have tomorrow . Not perhaps that he himself was afraid of what his nerves would tell him if he stood there . He was afraid rather  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she might understand through the trembling of his knees and wrists . It was as if an infection waited to enter her there ; its symptoms known , and its action terrible to describe . He must leave a little early , then , and tell her his lie on some spot of neutral ground . For there would have to be the lie that he had no time for her tonight . Now that he had begun to lie to her , he said , another one could n't matter . Then it came bitterly to him that to say this was to say the worst thing of all . Every lie to Lucy mattered  --  the millionth more than the first , by accumulation . Yet he must be false . She must not know . Without exactly realizing that he did so , he avoided the path to the spring , going the longer way by which he had come from Lucy 's house this morning . If Dutch saw him disappearing down the high/way he did n't care ; an errand to Windless could be invented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All he cared about now was getting early to the point where Lucy would leave her road for the spring ; reaching that point before she did and racing then to forestall her even perhaps before she left Aunt Esther 's gate . Ile was not prepared to find tier where he did  --  , lust at . the junction of road and path , and just on the point of entering the woods where the light of day would be entirely gone by this time , so that her pretty chess could not have caught his eye as it did now . I lc called to her , and his voice stopped her . Then his consciousness of standing at the place where another voice had spoken to him last night gave a sudden desperate speed to his feet , so that he ran to her and said everything at once , not trusting his voice to wait for hers to interrupt . " Why , Ray , " she had begun , " I did n't suppose you would be coming from there . " But he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm awfully sorry you got even this far . I was hurrying , you see , to tell you that I ca n't see you tonight for more than this minute . Something 's the matter with Lena , and I was just now on the way to Windless , to the drugstore . Then I remembered what time it was , and slipped down here from the highway to let you know . I hoped you would n't havep109left the house yet . I could have saved you some trouble anyway . " " Some trouble ! " said Lucy , laughing a trifle unnaturally . " Whoever called it trouble ? But I 'm sorry , Ray , for Lena . Do n't they know what it is ? " " I guess not , except that Dutch always sends for this "  --  and he put his hand in his pocket as if to take out a prescription . " I 'm sorry it had to happen . " She kissed him briskly and with pretended primness . " Why , so am I. But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there with someone in it , so that I could n't go along to the drugstore and back . " " Yes . " " Well , ten seconds was something . Aunt Esther has been making up for her silence this morning , you know . " " On a rampage ? " " Not bad . It really helped to see you . It 's all right . " " Lucy ! " He realized that he must keep from shouting . " I 'm dreadfully , dreadfully sorry . " " I 'm not . Now . So run on . I think I may go in and sit by the spring a little while . You can think of me there . " " No , no ! You must n't ! " Lucy had been pushing him away from her , but now she tightened her slender hands on his sleeves . " Why , Ray , what 's the matter ? " " Oh , nothing , " and he started to go . " Good-bye ,  |p110sweet  . Good-bye . I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want to miss you as much as I will , thinking of you there alone . But you do what you like . Of course go in . I 'll  --  " " Be there tomorrow night ? " He hesitated . " Yes . "  --  Ellen everything will be the same again . Now go , " and she pushed at him again . Even last . night . he had not felt so guilty as he felt oil the dark way up to where the swift stream of cars swept by without knowledge of this or any other guilt iii his approaching eyes.  | I T RAINED AGAIN DURING THE NIGHT , AND IT WAS STILL drizzling as Ray turned out of the wood road and left every thought of his sleepy household behind him . Their lack of life this morning  --  even his father dozed so deeply that nobody entered the room  --  had soothed him as it seldom did , surrounding him with a sense that nothing had changed in a world which might creep on at this pace forever . Now that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was coming nearer to headquarters , he found it necessary once more to plan the course of his behavior . Dutch and Lena would undoubtedly be up , and he almost hoped they would be arguing , since that would leave him out of it . But something might have been decided ; in which case it would be necessary for him to produce the proper attitude , whatever it was . A returning gust of wind and rain drove him more rapidly to the door than he had intended to move , so that he did not observe the presence of a low car with side curtains under the porch ; and therefore he was not prepared for the sight of three state troopers in the room . His heart missed a beat , but then he heard it continue its pounding while they turned forp112a look at him and while he swept their faces with an insistent curiosity . He was more aware of how they looked , and of how they looked at him , than of what Dutch was saying . Later he took in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had completed their questioning of Dutch , who wore on his broad face a mingled expression of fear and importance . He was telling Ray that the tall one by the radio was named Donaldson , that the stocky fellow leaning against the candy case was Officer Mays , and that the third one , off at the fireplace , was  --  but Ray did not hear his mane , and the man remained so silent all clay that his identity was something about which he ceased to be curious . And even now the leather belts which slanted across the chests of the three strangers were more interesting than their names , and the way they regarded him was more significant than what they said . For Donaldson , who must be in charge , was speakinga final word to Dutch , having seemed to decide that Ray did not matter . " I do n't see much here to go on , " he said . " Or much to be excited about . " " That 's what I told him , " put in Lena fiercely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all right , " said Dutch . " But it did n't look right to me . " " And perhaps it is n't , " said Donaldson . " I 'm notp113saying it is n't . Your helper here  --  " with a glance at Ray  --  " you say he talked with Delano several times ? " " He sure did . The two of them were down there at the car when I came along yesterday afternoon . " " Are you Ray Slode ? " asked Donaldson suddenly , his clear , thin features taking on an intelligence of purpose which to Ray was even more ominous than the speaking of his name . " Yes . " Ray shook the rain from his forehead and stared straight back . " I work here . " " So they say . What did you talk about with Del-ano ? " " Delano . " " That 's the man 's name . We went through his things . " Ray said to himself that he must conceal his interestin the discovery . He had wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Delano . Delano . The man  --  but he must answer the question . " Nothing of interest . " " But what ? " Donaldson was not too curious , Ray thought ; yet he must be satisfied . " I do n't remember except in a general way . He asked me what most people do  --  how big Windless was , how many tourists stopped here as a rule , where the drinking water was , and so forth . " " He must have asked you about the water when you saw him in the morning , did n't he ? He would n't wait till afternoon . "  | " I suppose he did . The point is that it was never anything more important than that . " " What would be more important ? " The thin lips almost smiled , and there were light lines at the cornersof the eyes . " I do n't know exactly . Something personal , per-haps . " " Money ? " " Yes . " " Politics ? " " Yes . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " without hesitation , but Ray thought he managed it . " You mean he talked about women ? " " I meant he did n't . I meant it might have been important if he had . " Officer Mays turned indolently and took a chocolatebar from the case where he leaned , peeling the gilt paper from it with an air of solemn boredom . Ray followed his movements , glad for an excuse to look elsewhere . But no excuse seemed to be necessary , for Donaldson had turned meanwhile to Dutch again . " We 'll scatter and look around , " he said . " You people go on about your business . If we 're still here at noon can we have lunch ? " " Yes , sir ! "  | " Of course if Delano turns up you 'll let us know  --  in case we 're somewhere off the premises . " " Where would you be ? " " Between here and town , or maybe in the woods . He might have wandered off and got lost , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still hungry , Mays ? " Something about the almost feminine mobility of this man 's face as he walked smiling to the door inspiredin Ray a sudden desire to run after him and say : " I did it . I know all about it . When you hear me you will understand . " Something about the man was almost a command to put oneself trustfully in his power . Ray took a step in his direction . Donaldson seemed to know . " What is it ? " he stopped and asked , his voice softening significantly . " I  --  I was going to say that I know the woods around here very well . I might go with you when you search them . " Donaldson smiled again . " Did I say I would search them ? Hardly that . But thanks . I may call on you . " " Now that was nice of you , " said Dutch as the door dosed and the car doors opened . " That 's taking an interest . Yesterday I did n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person in my opinion would a been hopped up about Delano . Delano , Delano . Funny name . " " What 's funny about it ? " asked Lena , jumping to her feet and hustling to the kitchen . " Any bright guy would a heard it before . Well , I got to see if there 's anything fit to set before the law . Will they pay ? " " No difference , " said Dutch . " We 've got to do it . " " Yeah , and you had to call ' em before I was up this morning . " Ray , leaving them suddenly to themselves , wonderedwith new horror on the drive just why it was that he had offered to accompany the troopers into the woods . It wasn't. that he could have said nothing else when Donaldson turned upon him . He could have said any one of a thousand things ; or he could have denied the intention to speak . The woods , of all places ! The gravel road , and the tree with the cigarette lighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring , and the other path down to  --  down to the thicket , which he himself had n't set eyes on sinceIt was that , then . He had to see the thicket with his own eyes once more , even if a trooper stood at his elbow . His nerves told him now that he had been fighting this desire for an interminable time , and that the trap he had set for himself was a device by which the desire had won . With a trooper at his elbow ! He shuddered , making the rounds , both with the vision of a lean face watching him and with the vision which would be there for his own eyes to see . He knew now for the first time how much he needed to see the willows and the broken ferns , and the narrow space where the mold had been disturbed , and where two rains had fallen since the moment of his depar/ture . Night before last ! Only that long ago ! A long time , really , and he had never gone back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The man had had a name . Perhaps that was the reason  --  But he would not entertain the thought . Perhaps an hour had passed  --  but time moved with an unsteady gait this morning , and Ray was not sure  --  when he heard behind him , as he stooped to pick up an empty cigarette pack from the drive , the soft word : " Slode ! " He turned as slowly as possible and looked into Donaldson 's half-smiling face . " Oh . I did n't know you were here again . " " We just came in from Windless . Nothing there . Why did you say that about the woods ? " " Say what , sir ? " " Do n't you remember ? " " Do you mean about searching them ? " " Yes . " " Why , you yourself mentioned the possibility that lie had wandered off and been lost . I do n't think it 's likely , and did n't then , but I wanted to help you if 1 could . I 've always lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You live south of the highway . " " Yes . " " But you know these woods on the north just as well ? " " Just as well . "  | " Can you go now ? " " Of course . I 'll  --  " " No , I told Berger , and he gave his permission . " He waved his hand and the other two officers walked toward them from headquarters . " You lead the way , Slode . Where do we go ? " " Down past Delano 's cabin there is a path to a spring , and after that we can branch out several ways . " They followed hint to the edge of the woods , and he wondered how they looked at him , and whether they looked at one another behind his back . Their return had been mysterious , and Donaldson was completelymysterious . Mays seemed to be bored , but that might be his pose . The third fellow still had not spoken a word . Now what was Donaldson driving at ? He must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sentences Ray said . Yet there was no further sign of this when the four of them reached the spring . Donaldson simply asked : " Where now ? " and Ray , surprised at his own selfpossession , could say as simply : " You see there are several paths from here . This one leads out to a gravel road which cuts back to the highway . This other one goes off right to an open field about three hundred yards dead ahead . And the one I am standing in follows the overflow from the spring down  --  oh , maybe fifty yards , or maybe seventyfive , into the deep woods again . With the one wep119came by there are four altogether , and since there are four of us  --  " " All right , " said Donaldson . " This wo n't be a search , but we can poke around a bit . Have you any choice as to the paths ? " Ray was silent for a slow second . " No , " he answeredfirmly . " Well , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll go out to the gravel road . Mays , you stay here and use your eyes . " He said nothing to the other officer , who without a sign departed to the right . Ray , not trusting himself to look back , went slowly down the gully in the direction of the thicket . Was it their understanding that Mays would follow him as soon as he thought himself to be alone ? Or had they supposed that a man standing at the spring could see him where he was now  --  actually , and his coolness gave way to waves of excitement which chased one another up his body , actually within sight of the slender willows and the waist-high ferns ? He must remember not to look back , to seem to care if anybody'seyes were on him . Then he could not have looked back had he chosen , for here he was at the point where his feet had turned into the willows , and where his arms had carried something almost as heavy as himself , and where a little farther in he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a monstrous confusion in the mold which centuries had let alone.  |p120It  was hard to know whether anyone strange to the place would see that someone had been here night before last . Ray , knowing how little time there was to stay , stared desperately at the ground . The evidences were not clear , one way or the other . Yet there were evidences , or the question of their clarity would not . have risen in his mind . Yes . Yes . And meanwhile perhaps a pair of eyes was studying him . He must . hurry . Yes , Ile nuts ' . scent to dart in there as a matter of routine and push the ferns aside for a better glimpse of the ground . Without another thought . he plunged into the heart of the thicket , trampling as much foliage as his feet could touch , Wand exaggerating the disorder he had left  --  he realized this easily now  --  for anyone to discover . He was obliteratinghis own tracks . But the process brought him by degrees to the grave itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze downward he knew that he must trample it too . He must trample the body of that man who lay on his side with a flashlight shining in his face  --  if it shone . If it shone . The question made Ray gasp audibly and turn to run . Yet he must do something first . He must kick this mold about , he must trample the earth as if he did not know it had something under it deserving of an endless peace . He stamped with an excess of savagery before he ran , and he ran before he remembered that he mustp121contrive a casual return to the spring where one of the officers might be waiting . They were all waiting as he came slowly round the final bend ; all sitting there on the stones and smiling at him . " We did n't bother to go as far as you did , my boy . " Donaldson laughed quietly . " I found nothing , " said Ray . " There was a thicket where some animal had been , but that was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paper from another chocolate bar and aiming it at the center of the spring . " You see , " said Donaldson , getting up to go . " It was a little idea of mine . But as soon as you said you did n't care which way you went I knew I was wrong . We have to follow up everything , you know . Come on , boys , there 's nothing to this . As a matter of record I 'll take that New jersey number down and wire to Trenton for information . But there wo n't be any . This is something that can wait . Thanks , Slode . " Ray watched them , speechless , as they wound their way ahead of him up the slope.  |p122NothING  WAS SETTLED YET . RAY KNEW THIS ASsoon as he recovered his ability to walk ; and knew it still better when , trailing the troopers into camp , he passed Number 20 with the inert great car beside it , and glanced down at the number plate inside its chromium frame . Donaldson would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone would come ; Delano would not come ; the disappearance would be accepted as a fact . Beyond this there was nothing for hint to know . But that was a blessing at the moment . And it was not to be compared with the greater blessing of his escape ten minutes ago . The memory of it set his heart beating under his damp shirt which the drippingwoods had left still damper ; and freed his mind of a load which until then had been all the heavier because it had been so vague . He hurried on after the officers , whom he saw climbing into their car as Donaldson delivered a final message to Dutch . " You will keep me informed , Berger . My hunch is that he 'll show up . " " Do n't know about that , " Ray heard Dutch say . " Neither do I , of course . But in either case keep constantly in touch with the office .

They were down there to please your husband , and when they thought they had been away long enough they came back . " " Thought so . " And Lena laughed too . " All the same , " growled Dutch like a dog from whom a bone has been taken away , " we 'll see . " " I 'm goin ' to see how many bars the fat one took , " said Lena as she disappeared from the door . " My God , no wonder he 's so big he ca n't stand up . " Ray hastened off about the business of the day , which relieved him so much in the doing that hours went by under a bright sun before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another hour to come . This was the hour when he would see Lucy  --  at the spring , as she believed . Yet hardly there , he said ; admitting the doubt gradually , and reverting to a fraction of his former confusion as the admission became clear . No , not at the spring . It had been possible to stand there with an effect of casualness while he talked to the troopers , and while a certain initial strain had been endured . But with Lucy it would be different ; and as for bringing her up to the camp  --  he shivered at the prospect of their rounding the corner of Number20 in the dusk which by then would have fallen . With Lucy everything would be different , because  --  he said it to himself again  --  it was Lucy more than anybody else who must n't know , it was Lucy who stood at the dead center of his days . There had been a moment when he thought he could tell the officers everything they wished to know . But never Lucy , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he wondered how he would deceive her tonight . It seemed easy enough to deceive her . She was latching the gate behind her as he came running up the road , and she was so pleased by the surprise of his hands at her waist that she forgot to wonder whether Aunt Esther saw their kiss . " Hello , my faithful . " Ray hoped he heard in his own voice the ring she must have missed last night . " Hello yourself . Did you come to take me to the spring ? " " Not on your life . Lena 's bad again and needs more of that stuff . So I 'm taking you to Windless with me . " " Oh ! In a car ? " " My lady , we walk tonight .

" They went on , arm in arm , until they reached the shoulder of the highway and crossed over so that they could walk along the left side , against traffic . " It 's the safer side , " said Ray , " because you can see what 's coming . And they can see us . I mean you . " " Ray , we do n't walk out much like this , do we ? " " We do n't , for a fact .

"  | A truck went booming and clanking by , sending a noise as it passed them like dozens of great knives hacking angrily at one another . " I am away from home so little , " said Lucy , holding his arm more closely as the rasp of the tires subsidedin the distance , " that I do n't know what to do when that happens . " " Nobody does , dear . We simply get used to it . " " And I don't. know either what people in Windlessknow about Inc . Or about us . " " Well , you wont find them falling all over the sidewalks with surprise . For that matter you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , who are my friends ! There are the girls I used to see every day in school , but they do n't come to the house now . Louise Armstrong was so frightened by Aunt Esther once that  --  " " Louise is going to be married . " " I know . " " And so are we . " " I know . " " But not in Windless . " He was aware of a sudden emphasis in his voice , and of an almost startled glance from her . " You 've said that before , of course "  --  she seemed to be explaining the silence which had ensued  --  " but I was never sure you meant it . " " I do , " he said , as evenly as possible . " Someday itp127wo n't matter a bit who knows us in Windless and who does n't . " She was silent again  --  so long that he slowed his steps , expectantly . " But where shall we be ? " " That matters less than the fact that we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I could ever leave Aunt Esther . " " I could , " and out of his relief he laughed unnaturally , pulling her into motion once more . She reproved him with a pinch , and then grew silent because they had entered the one street of Windless . It rambled ahead of them , half-lighted in the dusk , and the few people they passed were ready enough to recognize them with a wave of inquisitivehands  --  ready enough , thought Ray , to mumble : " Well ! There goes Ray Slode with Lucy Mount . Do n't see Lucy much these days , not since her father ( lied . But then she always was one to hide herself . With Ray Slode now . Well , well ! " At the drugstore Ray remembered that he was deceiving her . " You stay outside , " he said , " and see whom you can see . I wo n't be more than a minute . " When he came out , pretending he had something in his pocket , she took his arm with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , " she said . " In such a hurry ? " " Lena must be waiting . And anyhow I like the darkness better . We 're so used to it , you and I. "  | " See anybody in particular ? " " No . Whom would I see ? " Within a few minutes Ray was totally unable to understand wily he had said it , but some illusion of safety made hire say now : " That man , for instance . " Anyhow , he deckled , she will hear about it . Better then from nee than from someone else . From Dutch , if he has a chance , the fool . " That man ! " She clutched at him involuntarily ; then laughed in a fashion which for the moment misled hint . " Oh , Ray ! Not him  --  lie 's been gone from Windless for  --  let 's see  --  two days . It is n't like you to try to scare Inc like this . And maybe it is n't like me not to be scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had begun ! And how unnecessary , perhaps , the whole thing was . But he must go on , perversely , and correct her . " He 's both gone and not gone . You see , I did n't tell you he was stopping at the camp  --  I recognized your description the other night , but I did n't say anything then . You see , he 's disappeared . " " Disappeared , yes . I said he would go away . " " But his car has n't , and his clothes . They 're all there still , just as he left them day before yesterday . He never came back after  --  after  --  " " After I saw him ? " " Maybe once after that . I do n't know . But what 's the matter ? I thought you ought to know that there'sp129a little excitement about it already , and  --  well , I wanted to be the one to tell you . " She had stopped , and Ray 's arm felt her heart thumping with strange strength inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darling ? " It was foul , this pretendingnot to know . " Should n't I have told you ? " " Of course . " She got the words out , and having got them out pulled Ray swiftly after her along the highway . " Of course you should . " " But you are terrified . You see , Lucy , you must n't be terrified . I do n't know how I know , but you 're not in any danger now . " What meaning for her could this have ? he wondered . Yet he must say it . They were almost at the road which would take them to her house before she spoke again . " If I 'm afraid , " she said , " it 's not for me . Down t his road or anywhere . Not for me . " Ray looked along the darkness which lay between them and Aunt Esther 's gate . The thought of what it would be possible for her to imagine in there was awful . What he had to imagine was bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desire to say something that would soothe her . And yet there was no escape from the fact that the one disclosure which would settle something could not thinkably be made . And how far it would be from soothing her , even if it settled a certain ghost , was something he lacked the strength to contemplate.  | They were halfway home before he remembered how she had ended . " If not for you , then  --  what did you mean , Lucy ? " " Oh , " and she dropped her cold hand into his . " For him . " " For him ! " " Yes , Ray . I do n't understand , but I 'm afraid for him . For what . might have happened . " She seemed to want to say snore . " And ? " " Nothing ! " " Yes , something . You must say it . " " Ray . " I le waited ; and now they were on the other side of the gate . " You did n't  --  " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him about what I told you ? " " No ! " He almost shouted it . " You did n't send him away ? Or scare him away ? " He could n't say No again . It was easier to hold her in his arms , hard like this , and kiss her again and again . " Does that mean No ? " she asked , almost whisperingas they felt the dark door with their feet . He kissed her again , and whispered : " Silly ! " " I was , " she said . " Do n't remember it . Good night , Ray . "  | " Good night , silly . " " My name is Lucy . " " Lucy ! " He walked in a measureless night to the invisible gate and the road.  | HIS FEET , FAILING UNCERTAINLY IN THE DARK-'less , told him how unsuccessful his tongue had been . Everything that was wrong to say he had said , and the right things  --  he rehearsed them , one by one  --  he had said none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badly . Within half an hour after her confession that she was lonely he had filled her loneliness with new fears ; within fifteen minutes after his boast about their going away from Windless together he had done his best to make it impossible . If his intention had been to be cruel and stupid he could not have succeeded better . For there was no doubt in Ray 's mind that Lucy had grown afraid again . Her denials at the end  --  he searched his conscience and found he could not believethem ; or at any rate he could not be sure that they were to be believed . This , of course , was doubtingLucy , and that was painful . Yet it was nothing compared to the thought of her new distress , and the thought that her distrust of him might increase until there was no further hope that she would go away with him . Go where ? For the first time now the question seemed real to Ray  --  as real as the question whetherp133he should go at all . Often he had dismissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucy that the world was large and that it did n't matter where they lived . Or he had spoken in quite general terms of Mr. Allbright , the teacher who had left Windless four years ago and who had made Ray promise to look him up in Fall City if he ever decided to put the village behind him . It had been Mr. Allbright more than anyone else who set Ray 's mind in the direction of books , and it was Mr. Allbright 's praise of him  --  deliveredfrom a sallow face and reinforced by the penetration of those melancholy eyes  --  that he tried to remember now with something of the old flush . But it had been four years , and he had never heard from his friend after the first long letter . It seemed a long time suddenly , with Fall City ever so strange and far away , and with Mr. AllbrightYet the repetition of that name , obliterating the uncertain sound of his feet on the gravel , worked its old charm after all , and as Ray went farther under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not impossible . He had saved a little money from the wages Dutch paid him , even after he had given his mother what was due her . At least they could make a start together , he and Lucy . If she would go now . If she trusted him . He found himself endeavoring to read her present thoughts as she lay in bed , and was appalled by the conviction that her chief effort these last few days must have been to conceal her mind from his . The one person to whom she had been able to say anything had ceased  --  he knew it , remembering the abruptness of his behavior  --  had ceased to be that person . And all at once he seemed to take her place  --  or rather , she took his , for she was walking there under the tall oaks instead of him , listening for strange sounds , seeing unutterable sights . Through her eyes he made out , dimly at first but then with silver clearness , the outlines of a man who stepped into the road ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears he heard a rustling of leaves and a ringing of some pleasant voice , which was not unlike his own , and indeed harmonized with it as now she became aware of his presence beside the man . Then harshness , as of quarreling , and threats , and lifted hands ; and the vision of that other one running away , his head twisted oddly on his shoulders , his clothes no longer graceful on his body , and a small light glowing somehow through and through him as he ran . The sweat on Ray 's forehead was dreadful to feel , since no exertion he was making could have caused it . Even when he started running , and reached the highway on which there were no cars , he could not pretend that this was enough to account for so much moisture where a man 's skin should be always warm and dry . He was still thinking about this problem  --   |p135still  , with all his stubbornness , keeping his attention fastened upon a question to which he knew the answervery well  --  when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eaves while Hen and Roger argued downstairs about the location of the new highway that was coming to Windless next year from Harlan . He fell asleep exhausted , but the morning was not merciful to him , for the sun was in his eyes almost as soon as it rose , and there was no possibility this time of lying there as he might have chosen to lie , without the power to move . Instead he was up with something that seemed to him a stealthy and a guilty start . There was a duty to be done in these early hours before anybody in the house was awake . He would leave without a word to his mother or his father and make his way back through those woods to Lucy 's house . His going , indeed , had a double purpose . He wanted to convince himself that there was nothing in the woods to see , and he wanted to reassureLucy after last night ; or he wanted to reassure himself concerning her . He was n't going to pieces yet . He knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was happy to discover that the cold water of the creek regained its efficacy this morning as he stood waist-deep in it and poured it with both hands over his face and shoulders . It renewed hint for the day , and banished so many of the concerns which had pursued him home last night that he left almost inp136a state of wonder at the change . Halfway along the wood road he remembered his luck with Donaldson yesterday morning . Of course it was that ! His escape had relieved him at the time , but other things had come between to lessen the relief . Now it was returningas in the run of events it would ; as in the run of the world 's events all things do , the older and more important things having their solid way at last . It did him good to reflect thus , for he could believe that after enough time , given present safety , the good past would reassert itself . Delano . Again the name spoke itself by his side . The man had had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Ray . Of him  --  a man with a name , and now nothing  --  He ran , shaking his head in an effort to be rid of the sound his thinking made . I am sane , I am sane , he cried almost aloud as he crossed the highway and entered the woods . And sure enough he saw nothing as he went rapidly along except the long shadows which hung like vines between tree and ground  --  spreading in the distance and weavingtogether through a beneficent mist beloved of noisy birds . He saw nothing at last except the silent house where Aunt Esther would be cooking breakfastand behind which Lucy would be feeding the chickens in the bright dress she wore two mornings ago . When he failed to find her there he could turn his thought to the vanity in him which expected herp137always to be where he wanted her to be , and always at the exact moment . He sat down beneath a pear tree whose rusty leaves still dripped with dew and said to himself : I can wait . But he waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back door of the house opened and Lucy came out , her pale face not seeing him where he sat in a silence which for a long moment he was powerless to abandon . At the gate , though , she did see him , and ran through the flock of hungry hens , unconsciously spilling the corn for their delight , until she could look directly into his eyes . " You did n't sleep , " he said slowly , rising and pretending to scold her . " I know , " she confessed . " Do you forgive me ? " " For what ? " " For thinking things about you I do n't think any more . I was n't quite truthful when I left you last night . I still was afraid for him and you  --  that is , for you . Even of you ; it was terrible . But I did get to sleep at last , and now everything is all right again . I even think I could leave Windless  --  leave Aunt Esther . " She said it gravely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there was nothing for Ray to say except that he believed her . He said it with a kiss  --  " whether or not , " he whispered , " Aunt Esther 's looking . "  | She drew away from him a step . " But that might matter , " she said . " Just how ? I should think , after what you have been saying , nothing else would matter much . " " It is n't that she would care , " said Lucy , turning suddenly to the hens which had finished their first portion and were again about her feet ; " but that she would be so  --  so interested . " " Good enough ! " " No . Too good . I try to keep her from talking about us , for when she does she gets too close to us somehow . The other night , for instance , she told me she had dreamed of a man down in China who looked like you  --  " " Slit eyes and everything ? " " And whom she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You mean she put the earth between us ? You and me ? Listen , Lucy . For some reason I 'm not under that old lady 's influence any more . She suddenly seems to me quite harmless  --  interesting , but harmless . I wish you would try to see her the same way . " " I try . " " Well , your lord and master is telling you to succeed . Are you aware that I have n't had breakfast today ? " She was silent , watching the way two brown hens scrambled for a single grain of corn . " Lucy ! "  | " Yes , " she said . " I heard you . We 'll go in as soon as I 'm through here . I have to water them next , and then look for eggs . " " Of course , and I 'm your hired man beginning now . " But there was no more between them as they went about their work , and Ray thought he knew the reason for Lucy 's silence when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that Aunt Esther still stood at the back window where she had been watching them . It was as if they still were outside , and as if what she said were said to herself . " I have never been able to understand "  --  her tone was clear and deep  --  " the modesty of human lovers . Serpents have no modesty . Stallions have none . I have never seen bears , but I imagine they are as bold as daylight  --  and in the daylight . Whereas these two young people shy from each other in my presence as if they thought I was a killing frost . My husband kissed me when and where he pleased , and I permittedit . It pleased me . But these young people , unless they can hide in the darkness of the woods , are as cold and brittle as two toadstools . They ca n't bend , they ca n't embrace . And I do n't know about the woods now . Something new has come between them . Not me , thank goodness . I almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that I can fancy they are commencing to be strangers . It 's as if the woods had begun to smell too cold and bad for them . Like kissingthrough damp leaves . Or dirt . Or  --  " " Good morning , " said Ray , unable to hear more . " Is that him ? " Aunt Esther asked , not moving from her place . " Yes , " said Lucy , paler than before at the farthest side of the room . " It 's Ray . I asked him in to breakfastagain . " " That 's not quite true , " said Ray , his voice at a dead level , expressing as little as possible . " I asked myself . But when I diet I failed to realize how late it was . It 's later now , and I 'm afraid I must be going . " " It 's earlier than it was the other time , " said Aunt Esther . " I do n't believe you . " " 01 ) , I do , " said Lucy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I believe Ray . But we could hurry things , Aunt Esther , so that he would n't be any later than if he got breakfast somewhere else . I 'll hurry , Ray . You can help , too . You must n't go . " " Let him go , " said Aunt Esther , " if he 'd rather . Let everyone go as he will . I still do n't believe him , so you wo n't notice me tripping over myself to cook the eggs . What color this morning , Mr. Ray ? " She had turned at last and was marching to the shelves alongside the stove . " If you 're staying . " Ray felt Lucy 's hand beside his , and said : " I 'm staying . Thank you . Lavender , if you like . "  | " Have to be brown , " said Aunt Esther , looking around at him . " But I see you remember . There 's hope in that . " " Yet I do n't know , " she added after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not much hope in the younger ones these days . They wilt before they get their growth , and when there is somethingwithin their reach their fingers wither . There 's a weakness inside them . Valves played out in the pump , maybe . Now you two  --  " she addressed them as if they were absent , and as if it were an old habit of hers to consider things thus with herself  --  " you 're both afraid of something . And now you 're afraid of each other . Is there a hand that has come between you  --  not withered , either , but fresh and strong ? Like a hand of the old days ? A dead one , maybe , come to life , and warmer at that than these little flappers of yours ? A hand ! My husband used to insist that three was the sacred number , and my father before him said seven . But I know it 's five , for the five fingers of the human hand . Each one of them 's a miracle . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , from anywhere . Even from the grave . My husband has never lost hold of me , and someone 's got hold of you two  --  a hand there , a dreadful thing , separated from the rest of whoever it is , closing and unclosing by itself , holding you apart with the same strength that my dead husband uses when he holds us together . If you had any spunk you 'd strike it away . It could be done . It takes power in a person to endure a blessed hand like my beloved 's . It takes as much power  --  no more , no less  --  to cast off the curse of evil fingers . " Ray would have liked to sit as if he heard nothing , but hearing too much at last he broke in , ashamed of his hollow voice : " Mrs. Milton , there 's nothing wrong between Lucy and me . You 're mistaken . We  --  " " Yes , Aunt Esther . " Lucy seethed to enter the discoursefrom a vast distance over which her words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ray 's right . ' There 's nothing the matter . " They silenced her , so that she said nothing more while the meal lasted . But they knew what she believed , as Ray knew that Lucy had spoken in an agony of growing doubt . This knowledge kept him silent , too , until the moment when he followed Lucy outdoors and bent to kiss her as she turned her face , still serious , and offered her lips as in a trance . " Good-bye for the day , " he said . " I 'll know better next time . I 'll not stay . " " It would n't always be like this , " she said . " And even today I think she was trying . Ray . " " What is it , darling ? " " I 'll be at the spring tonight . It 's been a long time since we were there . I think that 's the trouble , if there is any . " " There is n't any , " he said . " There really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like me to come and get you , though , and walk with you from here ? " It was plain that she struggled to deny the necessity of this . But she could not manage it . " All right , Ray . I 'll be somewhere outside . " " Good . And remember . There 's nothing the mat-ter . " " No. "  | NO , THERE WAS NOTHING THE MATTER . AUNT Esther had said there was something , but it was Lucy 's denial  --  forced from her though it might have been  --  that Ray kept repeating to himself as he went on through the woods to the highway . He repeated it because he knew it was n't true ; because he was so helpless in the face of Lucy 's unconcealable distress . The burden he had to carry seemed all at once to be double its old size ; partly because of his clumsiness last night , which nothing he did this morning had cured , and partly perhaps because it was the nature of such a burden as his to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning found it double its old bulk . At a rate so monstrous , he said , it will fill the world ; it will fill the world for me , and I shall be carrying all space upon my back . But he told himself that he could carry it , since there was nothing else to do . He could carry it ; and possibly , if he did it with courage , the weight would grow less as time passed , so that he would cease to stagger . Lucy would know him again as the boy he had always been , and so she would begin once more to be the girl who had run to him almost every eveningthrough three years . He would contain himself ,  |p145however  costly the effort ; he would wear her doubt so thin that she could forget it , at least when they were together , and finally he would wear it out completely . He saw it disappear like a fine vapor , lifting above her head and trailing slowly away ; or like some transparent garment which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had grown rarefied in the light of this new resolve , so that it was difficult when he reached headquarters to receive into it the piece of information which Dutch came bustling out to impart . " Delano had a wife , " he said . " Or has . Lena says has . " " A wife , " Ray repeated . " Donaldson telegraphed Trenton , and they got in touch with where he lived . Or lives . She 's on her way now , Donaldson says . I just telephoned . " " When  --  " " He thinks this afternoon . Says he 'll bring her right out from Allfield . What do you think , Ray ? Will she clear things up ? Will she know anything ? " " What could she know ? " " Why , something about him . " " I see , " said Ray . " Did you notice I was early again this morning ? Do I get credit for that ? " " You do . You 're a good kid , Ray . I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lena 's no help , not even this morning when the cabin down there's still empty as hell . I tell you I ca n't hardly go near it any more . So I appreciate it , having you here to talk to . I guess you did n't want to leave me alone with my trouble . Is that it ? " " Yes , " said Ray . But lie was thinking of this wife , and wondering at the speed with which she had set out for Windless , and asking himself what differenceshe would make when she arrived . The day was interminable , once the night 's guests had gone , their cars backing out and leaving the dust-colored one alone , and once Ray had finished the main round of his chores . It had been a mistake , he said , to whirl into them as he did . They had allowedhint to forget other things for an hour or two ; but now the other things rushed back to fill the vacuum of an eventless day . He tried to read  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he had laid away among the linen  --  oh , it seemed months ago . He took the book to Number 11 and did his best to recover the magic of that name Merovingian . It was gone , however , along with any capacity he had ever had to hear what sentences were saying . He read the words separately , like signs ; hearing between them the harsh exclamationsof this wife he had begun to imagine , or her sinister hints , or her sudden point-blank questions , or her almost inarticulate sobs . For he imagined her voice in various ways ; it was never the same voice , because she was never the same woman , since hisp147image of her shifted with every modification of his fear . If anything was constant in his fear it took the form , which he tried in vain to argue down , that the woman would be clairvoyant ; that some mysterious instinct would lead her unerringly to the spring , and then , perhaps after a moment 's hesitation during which Donaldson would stare cruelly at Ray , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think beyond this point , except that once he said to himself : Things might be better then . I would tell my story , and I know I would feel lighter after that , no matter what happened . Yet he checked himself with the reminder of this morning 's resolve . No , nothing of the sort must occur if he could prevent it  --  if his imagination , that is , could prevent it . And he was aghast at the discovery that his imagination could seem to have so much power for him ; that he should depend on it so much ; that by surrendering to it he had already become its slave . He must stick to the fact , he said ; and the fact was that he knew nothing whatever about the woman and had no earthly right to conjecture what she would do . The fact also was that he must contain himself so that nothing would come out . He had it all right here inside him , and here it must stay . It was much to keep , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and got to supposing such absurd things as that his imagination could prevent an action on the part of someone he had never seen . The job was hard . Of course . Yet it could be done . Nothing prepared him for the manner of her arrival , which occurred a few minutes after four , when he had begun to think that Dutch might be mistaken in his insistence , hour after hour , that a police car would soon be turning in from the direction of Allfield . One did turn in  --  a closed one  --  and Donaldson got out of it alone . To Ray , standing dumbly at the pumps , he said : " Bring Mrs. Berger out . I want Mrs. Delano to go to the cabin with her . I 'll follow them in a few minutes , but you and Berger keep clear . That 's an order . Understand ? When you go in , make the man understandthat he 's to keep clear . I wonder he is n't out here now . How are you ? Been down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No  --  no , not down to those  --  " " Rats ! Hurry up now ! Mrs. Delano knows her own mind and she is n't interested in you . " Ray was glad to turn on his heel without a further glance at the car and enter the building in search of Lena . " What is it ? " yelled Dutch . " Are they here ? " " Yes , " said Ray . " But Donaldson wants to see Lena . Not you . He says for you to stay inside with me while Lena takes her down to Number 20 . " " What the  --  why , damn it , it 's my trouble as well as Lena's. "  | " Lena , " called Ray into the kitchen . " Can you go out front ? Donaldson and Mrs. Delano are there . " " You bet ! " Lena , doing something desperate to her hair , came scurrying around the counter without a thought for either of the men beside her . " Oh , boy ! Where is she ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held a hand on Dutch 's shoulder as the door slammed in triumph . " Let 's sit down . They wo n't be long . " " Yeah , but what the  --  here 's Donaldson ! " The tall trooper walked in with a confidential air . " Well , boys , the women can talk it over without us better than with us . A plain case , apparently . " " Plain case a what ? " Dutch was sullen at his accustomedtable . " Desertion . She says she 's been expecting it for years . Anyway for months ; and says she had the strongest hunch of all when he went off on , this trip . She has no doubt of it . He planned to disappear , and he 's done it . Slick , too . Simply dropped out of his room and his clothes . " " But where  --  " Ray could not help pushing in with the question . Donaldson shrugged his shoulders and smiled . " Now that 's another matter , and it depends on her as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make out whether she wants him back or not . She  --  I have n't asked her yet how proud she is about him . In some missing cases , you know , we do n't follow up . "  | " God ! " said Dutch . " I 'd like to be down there listenin ' to her when she sees  --  " " Well , you 're not down there , " said Donaldson quietly . " What about a cup of coffee ? You drink coffee , kid ? " " Yes , " said Ray , " and I 'd like it . I 'll get three of them , Dutch . " " All right . All right . " Ray felt safer behind the counter where the elationwhich had risen irr him like a wind among his clothes promised to be easier to conceal . This was an escape , too , like that of yesterday ; except that it meant more . For it meant that the case was going to cease to be a case . Questions were not going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From things outside of him , that was . From things like policemen and  --  and dead men 's wives . Delano . Mrs. Delano . The two names spoke themselvessoftly by his side . He hurried with the coffee , even to the point of spilling one of the cups and scalding his hand . " What 's the matter , kid ? Nervous ? " Donaldson smiled . " No , I think not . It happens sometimes . " " It sure would a happened to me , " said Dutch , shaking his head over his cup when it had been brought . " I 'm nervous . I never went through anything like this . " " You do n't want to join the force , then . " Donald/son smiled again . " Ray here  --  he might do . He 'd have to get over some notions , but after he got sensible he might do . Well , I 'll mosey along . Maybe I wo n't see you boys again . Mrs. Delano wo n't want to come in here , and I ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me posted on the next deserter . " He laughed as he went out , but Dutch turned excitedlyto Ray and said : " Maybe she 's finding something . Maybe she 's got hunches . I do n't know , I do n't know . Maybe it ai n't so simple , and she knows it . They say women have hunches , and see through things . " " No , they do n't , " said Ray with an enormous amount of assurance . " They do n't know more than we do . We know a lot ourselves . We know a lot . Do you want another cup of coffee ? " " By God , it wo n't do me any good , but I 'll take it . " They sat there with their coffee until Donaldson 's car went off at half past five with a woman whom they had never seen ; whom Ray , he said over and over to himself , had never needed to face . And he thought he was glad . He had both wanted and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to have her speak through Lena as the report of what had happened at Number 20 reached Dutch and himself at intervalsfrom the kitchen . " They 'll leave the stuff there a couple more days , " she said . " Then the troopers will ship it to her , sealed and everything . Donaldson told her to make a list , but she could n't look that close . He made sure there was n't any money . The guy must a had a pile , but it all went away in his pants . The rest of it  --  well , as I said , she could n't look at it . Queer old girl . " " Old ? " Dutch wanted to know . " Oh , she must a been ten years ahead of him . Not bad-looking at that . Big nose . She liked him , even if he was a bastard and she had her warning . " " 1 lad he told her he would  --  do this ? " Ray needed to know . " What do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all right , and she 's sure now . How about it , Dutch ? Glad you 're not runnin ' a Death 1-louse ? ( ) r sorry . I ca n't tell . " But Dutch did not answer her , nor did Ray interrupther again . " He was a good-looking bastard , " she went on . " I wonder who 's kissing him now . " Mrs. Delano . Ray heard the name again . He should have tried to see her . She had been his wife , and so  --  but he trembled at the thought of what he might have said to her ; and his trembling told him in a brief instant of clearness that his pity was as much for her as for himself.  | THEY SAY WOMEN SEE THROUGH THINGS . " Outside on the gravel Ray heard the wordsas clearly as if they had been whispered close to his ear . But not by Dutch . It was a softer voice , a woman 's voice  --  and so unmistakable that Ray , looking suddenlyaround , was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words themselves . A soft voice , a woman 's voice . It said the words again , farther away , in the direction of the woods , and  --  yes , Ray knew where they came from . She , the woman he had pitied , was standing in the thicket , preparing to scream . He almost heard the beginning of it  --  the shrill , forced breath before the high sound came . Then he prevented the rest by running back pell-mell into headquarters , where he was relieved by Dutch 's yell-ing : " Great Scott , Ray ! Who 's chasing you ? Who 's out there ? " The familiar voice restored him , and he lied almost cheerfully about something he had forgotten to take with him  --  a road map someone wanted and was waiting for . Nor could he be sorry that Dutch and Lenap154both were full of the day 's doings and insisted upon hearing his opinion of the desertion theory . He found himself talking like one who had heard of the case only now , and one therefore whose glibness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even pleasant to talk on like such a person  --  so pleasant that the sound of his own voice quieted him , and he could leave headquarters at last with no fear of sentences in the air . Now for the second time he could say to himself that he was safe . Ile said it as he went off at seven to meet Lucy ; trying as he went to remember the transient glory he had felt behind the counter , when it seemed that a fresh wind blew around his heart and lifted him above the stagnant pools of danger . He said to himself : The man was about to disappear . They all seem to believe that . And it seems to be true . So it is almost as if I had not killed him . I even helped him to disBut he quickly grew ashamed of such reasoning , which anyhow ceased to be possible as he became certain of something else . Why was it that this new feeling of safety lasted so brief a while  --  drying up in him as the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong inference at the spring ? But that was not the worst of it . The worst thing  --  he could deny it no ' longer  --  was this . As fast as he achieved security before the world he lost it within himself . As soon as other men lostp155their power to see into the thicket his own vision of it grew sharper , so that now , for instance , he saw nothing else , though he was carefully avoiding the region as he went to meet Lucy . The connection between him and the man under the mold was all the clearer because nobody else seemed able to discover it . It existed , then , in some pure state by itself , as if the man and he confronted each other in a conspiracy of white silence  --  the light of more than a single sun shining along a straight line which ran with great speed between them , tying them together and fixing the direction of their eyes . Was this the man 's revenge  --  not to inform the police , which would be so minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a narrow , undeviating shaft of light , a glistening filament of certainty not unlike  --  not unlike  --  and Ray knew that he must shut the flashlight entirely out of his thoughts , lest presently it leave the grave and come swiftly toward him , held in a hand he could not see , guiding a face he had not looked into sinceLucy 's voice came faintly to him from a distance which his bewilderment could not measure . I le had not known how close he was to the house , or why it was that she called his name twice before he answered . " Good evening , Mr. Sleepwalker ! " " Lucy ! I was  --  " " Thinking . So was I. But I never thought you would nearly run over me in the road . Gracious , how important it must have been ! " " What , sweetheart ? " " The thought I interrupted . " " You 'll never know how glad I am you did . Here ! " and he drew her almost roughly to him for a kiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or anything ? " " No , but I was afraid I would be . Ray , 1 have some news to tell you . " " Have they curie to take Aunt Esther away ? " " Silence ! No , I had a caller . Connie Johnson came to see me this afternoon  --  she simply came to see me , and we had a fine talk about everything we used to do in school . She told me all about Louise 's wedding , which is to be a week from Friday , and to which , would you believe it , I am invited . I was afraid for a while that Aunt Esther would say something wrong about the wedding  --  " " You mean you let her be there when you talked ? " " Well , she let Connie come . I mean , she was nice enough not to scare her away . So it was only fair  --  but as I was saying , I worried a good deal about the wedding , for you know how queer she could be about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all  --  " " Oh , no ! " " No , really ; but just because she thinks the things she does . As a matter of fact she was kind , and asked decent questions , and even wanted to know why Louise had n't been to the house lately . "  | " This is too much to hear all at once . " " So Louise is coming , probably . Connie said she would bring her if there was a spare moment before the wedding . Ted has been fine to Louise . Which reminds me for some reason  --  Connie asked about you . " " Did Aunt Esther answer ? " " No . I did . I said you seemed very well these days . I wanted to say a lot more  --  maybe about your wanting to go away , maybe about our going away  --  but I found I could n't . Anyway it was getting on toward our time , and I did n't want to be late . Connie only left fifteen minutes ago . Did you meet her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back way into town . You probably would n't have seen her if she had passed right by you . I did n't want to be late , Ray , because of the way I acted last night and this morning . I 'm sure it 's because we have n't been to the spring for so long . Its waters are curing , you know , even if you do n't get into them . " " They have an influence , " said Ray . " They do , they do . So come on , " and with a special effort at gaiety she started off through the dusk ahead of him , running and not looking behind to see if he followed . " Wait a minute , Lucy . " He could not rim , and for a moment he thought he could not follow her at any pace . " Wait nothing ! " Her laugh came back to him as she disappeared down the path in a half-darkness which he could almost wish complete . For he did not know how he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as now of course he must . At the back of his mind had been a plan to suggest another place  --  even Windless again , for he could lie three times as well as two . But she must be among the big stones now , and time was nothing for him to do except catch up with her as soon as his reluctant feet could bring him there . Ile checked a harsh impulse to criticize her feeling for the spring as something all too simple and foolish ; as irritating , he heard himself say  --  and was appalledbecause he could say it . No , he must remember that the spring had not changed for Lucy . He must keep the fact firmly in mind that it had changed only for him ; that it had not changed at all , really , in spite of what he had done to poison its waters and fill the air above it with strange draughts of cold . The cold was so palpable that he shivered as he walked slowly down the path ; and the loss of some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned without warning , and he scowled at Lucy as she ran back a step to meet him . He was so little himself , indeed , that he failed to measure the pain which his unaccountable frown could cause her . " Ray ! I thought  --  is anything still the matter ? " " With whom ? "  | " With you . Or maybe me . Or anything at all . Youknow . I had n't supposed we would speak of it . But  --  " " I do n't know what you 're talking about , Lucy . " " And that 's the worst of all ! " " Worst of all what ! Now do n't be excited about nothing . Ca n't I be a little tired of this place without your thinking it means  --  " " Tired of it ! " " Well , you make so much of a black puddle and a bunch of gray rocks . Somehow tonight I do n't see it the way you do . I see  --  I see only a puddle and a bunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A cold place , I tell you . Do n't you feel it ? Is n't it damp ? Or are you going to make the fuss you usually do ? Usually it 's all right with me , but tonight it is n't . " She stared at him , pale and silent , until he had finished ; when he suddenly saw her face with a recoveredclearness before him he was overwhelmed with sorrow for what he had said . " Lucy , " he said . " Come here . " " No . You come here . " He stepped to her , and at the instant of his touch felt her whole body shake as if with illness . " Your hands are cold , Lucy . " " So are yours . You 're right , Ray . It is cold . Everythingis . " " Not everything . You do n't understand . I think I 'm not well . I have n't been sleeping lately , for certainreasons at home . I 'm tired , Lucy . I 'd like to gop16o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's just that I 'm tired . Tomorrow night I wo n't say such things about your spring . I never will again . Poor kid . I 'm sorry . I did n't know what I was saying . " " Your hands are so cold , Ray . " She looked at him quietly again , and took his arm to move away , guidinghim gently for the first few steps . " It 's your spring too , you know . " " I know . " " But that is n't what I care about . To think that I should n't have known you were cold ! To think I should have gone on making this fuss about our puddle when  --  " " I 've taken back that word . " " It 's a good word if you said it , Ray . I 'll take you home . " " No . " " And put you to bed . " " No , really , dear . I 'm not sick . It is n't anything to last . Remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " At the house ? " " Well , yes . " " And then we 'll go somewhere else than here ? " " No ! " They were by this time halfway to the gravel road , and that may have been why it was easier to answerwith resolution . But Ray could believe also that his courage had come back to him ; that he would never behave again as he had behaved five minutesp161ago . He thought : I must have no mercy on myself , I must not try to save myself in advance , I will take every dare . " No , dear , " he said . " You do n't seem to understand . I was n't well tonight . It was nothing more than that . I 'm this way sometimes , and then nothing looks the same to me as it did . " " I know . " " But you do n't know . You 're always the same . There never was a more faithful person in the world  --  and that 's why I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you  --  even me . " " If I 'm so faithful , as you call it , then maybe it does n't matter how much you change ; I can always bring you back to the old things . Can I ? " " You can , darling , and you practically have already . For instance  --  " " No , I 'm not going to let you take me farther than this . You do need sleep , I see it , and I 'm not the slightest bit afraid of going the rest of the way alone . " " I believe you , but I 'm taking you home . " " All right . But hurry afterwards and get immediatelyinto bed . Your hands are warmer  --  a little , I think . You 'll live , mister , and come back to inc to-morrow . " They laughed tentatively in the darkness , and when their laughter seemed to succeed went on in silence to Lucy 's gate . " Now it is good night , " she said , kissing him swiftly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But do n't think I 'm too faithful . " " How could you be ? " " You would get tired of me . It probably is n't fun , being able to count on anyone so much . I see I must worry you a little , if only to keep the circulation going in your hands . Now how shall I worry you ? " She found his face again in the darkness and pretended to study it with her fingers . " I 'll ask Louise and Connie . They 'll know . " Ray realized that he must appear to take her lightly . " You must n't , " he said . " Just now you were concerned about my health ; and then you go on to talk of ending my clays tomorrow . I could n't stand it , loving you more than I do tonight . I 'd go to bed and never get up again . " He sounded graver than he ought to sound , he said . " All right , Ray , I wo n't ask them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by myself . " " I 'm satisfied with that . Good night , faithful . Do n't worry . And do n't you change . " " Good night . I won't. "  | SHE COULD TALK LIKE THIS , HE SAID , BECAUSE SHE was not afraid . She could appear to be the stronger of the two because she had less than he to keep on thinking and thinking about . Lucy could flutter up and down the scale of feeling  --  now terrified , now reassured and smiling like a child  --  according as he succeeded in his lies ; for there was nothing in her life like this thing in his , which would never go away now , and which appalled him with the sudden thought that he would have to go on lying about it as long as he lived . No , Lucy had only the burden of her childhood 's terrors , which survivedin her and were fed upon the bitter tonic of Aunt Esther 's talk . But all of that was simple  --  even with the addition of the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been easy for her to " save " him tonight . Poor girl , she thought she had saved him . In another moment he admitted his unfairness . He found he could not measure after all just what it was that Lucy had had to overcome in herself before she could laugh with him and play in their old way with words . He did not know her mind these days , if he had ever known it . Oh , he had known it , though . And she had known his . But if she should know it now  --  he trembled at the vision of her shrinking suddenly to nothing , or at best to a small face which looked pitifully at him from a far distance : small and white , like a flower lost in the sky . How could she save him then , what barrier could she erect between him and this thing which , strangely , was both inside and outside him all the time ? I ler " strength " would be as nothing in the vast desert of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dry earth would be a blessing compared to this jungle wherein his feet were always being trapped by the lithe vines of memory , and where among infinite trees there ascended mists and false lights to entangle his eyes . At any rate no power would be left in her voice to divert him from his danger . As long as she found him ailing in trifles she would be prompt to soothe him ; and she could soothe him still , if only for a few secondsof time . But when she should learn of his deep disease  --  why , then too much of herself would die in the discovery . Yes , die . And the thought of her leavinghim that way , withdrawing the frail support of her hands as her voice lost every vestige of its sweet cheerfulness , restored him all at once to his belief in some strength which she possessed surpassing his . He must have believed it even while he said what he had said . It must have been supporting him evenp165while he condescended to her . For that was what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his necessity , which was simply to keep her in his mind , where the thought of her , as always it had been , was somehow reassuring . If only Lucy were here now . Not merely in his thought , where she wavered uncertainly on the crazy tides of his belief and unbelief , but here in all the frailty of her flesh , so that he could reach for her hand at any time and feel how much he depended upon her presence . The woods were not themselves tonight . Or rather , he said , they were . Too entirely themselves , so that for the first time since  --  since then  --  he found it almost impossible to go forward through a sense of danger which was thick and awful about his feet , as if he were being asked to walk through a darkness literally solid . And yet it moved , with currents in it that wound like sluggish serpents toward him and away from him . It was alive , he said , this darkness , so that he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go . Any direction would have found him deeper in it than before ; nor could he stand still when it moved between his feet like an unresting stream without bed or boundary . Then he became aware that he had reached the entrance to the path which led to Lucy 's spring . Not his spring , he said . And that without his wanting to he had already started along this path . He thoughtp166he stopped and tried to turn back . He was not sure he tried , but he was sure he could not turn back , for here his feet were lifting and falling as if by someone else 's will , bringing him nearer and nearer  --  not to Lucy 's spring , for he was thinking of that no longer , but to the other obscure path which turned left and followed a trickle of water down to whereAt . the spring , then , he must take hold of himself and turn briskly uphill to the camp . He was due there anyway , ( ( lit tines ago , and Dutch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear Dutch 's voice , but it was smothered in the silence around lint . " Then he did not try to hear it , for to his horror he found himself turning left past the big rocks , and he lost all thought except of the fact that he would be there soon . It seemed that he had been mistaken about its being perfectly dark . Here in the depth of the woods , where if anywhere the sun would have gone out , it remained as a mild glow  --  fast fading , to be sure  --  which fell on every leaf and trunk and stained it a deep brown . A soft brown , which would have been benign and warm if it had not spoken also with a certain note of harshness , like the colors in cheap paintings such as that one his mother would never allow to be taken down from its high place over the kitchen cabinet . It showed a hunter , standing in an autumnal forest and listening with gun in handp167for the far sound of the horn . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though they were made of bronze or copper , and had the man 's eyes not stared so blankly forward from the midst of so much shallow and metallic shade . This shade was of the same sort , and this light too came from no authentic source ; and the same blanknesswould probably reveal itself in the eyes of that man over there when he lifted them . At present he seemed to be absorbed in the ground from which he would appear to have risen ; to be rather absentmindedlytrying to account for his ever having been there . He stood in the center of the thicket , looking down , his head turned at a strange angle over his shoulder , his body motionless , his clothes spotted irregularly with patches of yellowish gray . The patches might fall off if they were shaken ; if the man moved even the slightest muscle ; if he became aware of Ray and looked up , for instance . On the other hand , however , they might not fall ; for they were not made of dust or forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . They were stains , dyed into the cloth , penetrating into the man as far as  --  Ray , thinking more and more rapidly , said to himself : as far as the skin itself . Then he was sure he knew that the man inside the clothes was blotched here and there with discolorations of yellow and gray . They almost showed through the clothing . They did in fact show through , for they were what Ray had mistaken for dirty places on the coat and trousers . There were not very many of them , but they existed , and it was by them that the man now seemed to be bewildered , as any man is when he discovers something on himself which he can not explain . If he would look up , said Ray , I could ask him ; or I could tell him , for I understand everything better than he does . He isn't. the hunter in Mother 's picture , he is  --  and Ray struggled with a desire to pronouncea certain name , loudly and quickly , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shoulders , and the face perhaps would turn directly toward his own . It was not that he wanted to know whose lace it was , but that it was necessary to determine whether on the cheeks too there were patches of spreading gray , edged with a fungous yellow . " De  --  De  --  " Ray almost spoke the name . But he stopped every time at the second syllable , his tongue dying in his mouth as the echo of the remainder rang through the aisles of his listening and rigid body . It was as if he were the forest itself , with dark lanes running everywhere from this opening where his mind stood , waiting impatiently for something it had no wish to hear or see . Then , just as he was deciding that the man would never look up , the forest grew suddenly soundless , so that Ray could not hear himself speak or think ; and darkness swept inward like great waves.  | HE COULD NOT HAVE LAIN THERE LONG , FOR through the trees between him and the camp he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always hovered over Dutch 's sign : WINDLESS CABINS . If Dutch had not turned the sign off it was at least no later than eleven ; and the chances were that he had been here on the ground only a few minutes . He occupied himself methodically with such calculations as he stood up and felt his way upwardto the spring ; then right along the path to the gravel road ; then left to the highway ; then left again until the sign fairly blinded his eyes . WINDLESS CABINS . Twenty of them . Perhaps half of them would fill up with people tonight . That would be ten . Or if twelve , three-fifths . Or if fifteen , three-fourths . It was a relief to be among such things as numbers , which never changed , which never decayed , which looked at you when you called them , and nimbly did your bidding . They were his necessity now , for the rest of this night . He refrained from saying why , and was astonished that he could do so  --  that he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ago . Then he hastened to dismiss even this happiness from his mind , since it might be succeeded by some/thing else ; and ran to where a car had stopped before the door of headquarters . He would be the first to address the new customers , so that when Dutch or Lena came out it would appear that he had been busy among the cabins all the while . There were two middle-aged people in the car , and the woman was unwell from driving . It was the simplest matter , as Lena watched from the doorway , to step on the running board and guide them back around to Number 11 ; where it was a pleasure to assist the woman from her scat , turn on the light in the cabin , explain where water was , and acknowledge the man 's remarks about tomorrow 's weather . At headquarters again it was delightful to chat with Lena while Dutch sat sullenly by his table ; to prove his dexterity to himself as he kept the talk always on something other than the guest who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the joy still mounting in Lena at the remembrance of Dutch 's error ; and at last , after coffee and a sandwich , to saunter away with an easy " See you in the morning . " " Did I tell you , Ray ? I called Donaldson , " shouted Dutch through the door . " Any news ? "  --  over his shoulder . " No , " said Lena . " Dutch thought he might have wired for his razor or something . He had n't . He 's cutting his throat with a new one . What did you expect ? It 's only been three hours since Madam was here . "  | " I did n't expect anything , " said Ray as he passed out of hearing down the highway . Now that had been a good thing to do  --  to sit there so easily and kill an hour with his employers . It was good for him to have done it , too , for now the night was just like any other night , and soon he would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another day would be entirely different from this one which was ending . No other day would be like this one . It had been a bad one . But it was a satisfaction to know how well he had handled it at the close ; to realize , for instance , how simple it would now be to annihilate the two miles of wood road by counting his steps as he went along . He knew about how many there would be . If two miles , then about thirty-five hundred . But he would see . The fatigue of counting was in itself something to be grateful for , since it took the place of any other fatigue either in body or in mind . If it did not rest his mind to count , at least he was not going to feel worn out so that sleep was impossible . Everyone knew that monotonous labor made you ready for sleep . Two thousand . Yes , that was right . He was considerably more than halfway home . Two thousand one , two thousand two , two thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little numbers would suffice . He would n't forget that he was on his third thousand . Nine , ten , eleven , twelve . It was thirty-four hundred and twenty , exactly , to the kitchen door , where a light had been shining all the time without his knowing it . Well , he was glad to find somebody up . No need for bed yet , actually , and a little more talk might help to make him thoroughlysleepy . His mother called him from his father 's room , where the lamp was turned down as far as it would go and still burn . Ile wondered if anything had gone wrong ; and decided that nothing had when at the door he discovered Hen in the darkest corner , grinningnurrc or less good-naturedly at him . " Hello , Hen . Hello , Mother . Hello , Dad . What are you all doing up so late ? Do you know what ? I 've been counting my steps in from the highway . Three thousand four hundred and twenty , exactly . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some mathematickler ! " Hen said and laughed . " We 're up , professor , to learn something from you . " " Yes , Ray , " from the bed . " Hen here heard this afternoon about the man that disappeared up to the camp . Was goin ' by and Berger told him . We had n't got any news of it before . How was it , Ray boy ? You know we do n't get much news , or at least I do n't , with this infernal sore place keepin ' me in bed like I was plastered to it . I said I 'd wait up for you . Ma said No , but I spoke up for myself and said Yes again , so here we are . There ai n't room for another chair , but be a good boy and tell me something . Did hep173look to be rich ? Hen saw the big car , and figured he was . " " He must have had money , " said Ray , rememberingLena 's words with a careful indifference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man that disappeared . You know everything about him . " " Well , Dad , not everything . " " Not where he is , of course . But what kind of a customer he looked to be . " " I did n't see much of him , to tell the truth . " Ray said to himself : This is the truth , but even if it were not I could n't add to it . Nor will I subtract . I 'll tell him what he wants to know . I 'll answer his questions until there are ten of them . I 'll keep count , and when the tenth one has been reached I 'll stop . " Oh , but Dutch says you talked to him . Several times . " " Yeh , " said Hen , " and Dutch said you talked to the state cops , or they talked to you . Is Donaldson that skinny one with the white face ? What 'd he make you say ? " " Why , he did n't make me say anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " lien was dissatisfied , and because he was dissatisfied his tone took on the old note of soreness . " I was only answering your question , " said Ray . He must keep his temper . " Donaldson asked me what we had talked about , and I told him I could n't re/member anything out of the ordinary . People who stop always say the same things . " This was true , he told himself , as if there were another person in him reporting upon the one who spoke . " But what I want to know is , " said the father , " was there anything queer about him ? " " You mean  --  " " I mean not like us . Was lie a dresser ? " " Oh , yes . Ills clothes were very fine . He had a bright reel bathrobe . " " What 's that ? " " A long , comfortable thing you wear when you do n't want to keep on your suit . " " Well , I do n't , because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now . You mean , Ray , over his under-wear ? " " Yes . " " You see , Ma , I 've learned something from this . Man had a bathing robe . " " He had a gold razor , " put in Ray for good measure , and to keep the remarks coming toward him . " My God ! Gold ! Not plated ? " " Well , maybe . I did n't bite it . " " Guldarn it , I believe I would of . Say , Ray , did he have an immoral look ? " This was harder to answer . " You mean , a look as if he were running away from something he had done ? No . " " Yes , or like he was goin ' to do something soon.  |p175Was  n't any of them racketeers , was he ? From a city , do you think ? " " Oh , certainly . " " New York ? " " His license plate was New Jersey . " " Same thing , they say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some buddy to join up with him ? " This was ten , if Ray had counted right , and even if it was not it must be the last one . " Dad , I 'm tired . " He turned for the door . " It 's been a hard day , and I 'm not sure my supper agreed with me . " " Hey ! Hold your horses ! We had n't any more'n got started . Gosh , this was n't worth waitin ' up for . " Ray went on out of the room , the whine of his father 's voice becoming fainter as he climbed to where , if his strength held out , he soon would be blessedly asleep . " Ray ! " The old man was making a last effort . " Come in in the morning . I 'll be awake . " But here was the bed , and he would rather lie down on it , clothes and all , than recognize the most welcome voice in any world . He lay clown in the complete darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself that unconsciousness must have arrivedalready , because he could feel no bed under him and the pillow was like cool , empty air about his cheeks . Now rest was arriving too  --  more rest thanI he deserved , perhaps . For what had he done to deservethis gift of softness which entered his legs and arms and dissolved them until they lay out there almost as if they were not his at all ? It was a kind of helplessness , really . For when the darkness dissolved too and showed him Lucy standingmotionless by the bed , her face hung down toward his , he was unable even to blink , let alone lift one of his hands as a sign that he saw her . Then he knew that this would be superfluous . For she did not see him . Such eyes could not see anything , fixed as they were in a face whose even gray deepened here and there to a blotch , half black , half yellow , like these other patches on the forearm which hung near him  --  hung and did not advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were discolorationsnot unlike  --  not unlike themselves , he was conscious of insisting . But that was less than the whole truth . They were not unlike  --  and his voice came back to him hoarsely , like some voice he had never heard . " Lucy ! " he groaned aloud . " Lucy ! Go away ! " When she did not seem to hear him he groaned with all his strength . " Lucy ! Please , Lucy ! Not here . Not now . Please , if you love me . " " Ray ! " His mother was calling from downstairs . " What is it ! What are you saying ! " He looked , and Lucy was gone . " Nothing , Mother . It was nothing . Do n't come up . "   " Well , call me if you need me . " " Yes . I will . " " Good night . " Then Ray was asleep and could not answer .   I T WAS HEN THERE AT HIS FEET , DRAGGING HIM BACK into daylight : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that it was lien who tugged at him so roughly , disregarding his desire to live on forever , prone in darkness . " Do n't you know how late it is ? " Hen shouted . " I Ian past nine . You 'll never get there on time , and besides Pa 's waitin ' downstairs . He could n't hardly sleep all night , he says , for fear you 'd light out early and he 'd miss the big news . " " Oh , " said Ray . " Dad . But if it 's half past nine there wo n't be any chance  --  " " Yeh , there will . While you eat breakfast . Step on it , big boy . I 'll tell ' em you 're comin ' . " Ray dressed slowly , fumbling for his overalls and blue shirt in a light which blinded him with its unwelcomecandor . Then he remembered enough of last night to make him start ; and after that to hasten like a man who must not be found lingering where he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Hen muttered an exclamation of surprise , settling down then , he seemed to say , to something good . " Golly , Ray , I thought you 'd skinned out . I wokep179up before daylight and then dozed off again ; woke up about an hour ago and did n't hear anything , and said to myself , That boy 's gone and left me , danged if he has n't . Feel all right ? " " Oh , fine . So you want some more of the story . " " Yes , sir ! What is it , Ma ? You 're not takin ' him out to breakfast already ! " " He can talk to you from here , " said Mrs. Slode in the kitchen . " Where do you suppose he is ? " began Mr. Slode , hoping for at least a minute 's delay . " What 's your theory ? " " Why , the same as theirs  --  Donaldson 's and Lena 's . His wife  --  " " Say , now , what kind of a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see her . " " Did n't see her ! " " Only Lena did , and Donaldson . She wanted to be seen by as few persons as possible . " " Suppose that 's natural too . But what 's your theory ? " " Simply that he wanted to get away from her , and did it in the quickest way . Donaldson thinks she wo n't go after him . So he 's probably a thousand miles away by this time , in new clothes and  --  " " Now there 's something . He 'd have to get rid of the clothes he was wearin ' , would n't he ? " " Yes , if he expected to be chased . As it turns out , P180this was n't necessary , or wo n't be if she gives him up . " What you reckon he 'd do with the old ones ? " " He could  --  bury them . " " Just what I said . They would n't be rotten yet if he did , would they ? " " Rotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days  --  " Ray looked at his father almost in fear . " Well , then , if you or lien or one of the older boys was to find ' em and dig ' em up you 'd have something . Eh ? Not money , though . He would n't bury his cash . " Ray chose abruptly to heed his mother 's calls from the kitchen . " I can hear you there , " he said , and disappearedthrough the doorway like one who is hunted from room to room . " What does Dad want to know all these things for ? " he asked his mother , steadying himself at the table . " Oh , what else is there for him to think about ? " " Is that all ? " " What do you mean , that all ? " " It 's just a sick man 's curiosity ? " " You could call it that . But sit down and eat . " " I will . " Ray sat down , glad of a command he could obey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers of which he was capable . He was glad of the questions , too . He would not have wanted silence . There would be enough silence afterp181a while . He knew it , and did his best now with the tongue that had been given him . Yet the time came when he must go . Even as it was he would be late at the camp . As if that mattered , he said ; and immediately remembered how important it was that something should matter . Yes , he must keep something on the top of his mind ; he must not cease to say as he went along the wood road : I can make it in thirty-five minutes ordinarily , but this morning I 'll make it in twenty-five . The ten will help . Counting by sixties as he went , he was able to keep uppermost in his thoughts the fact that he would be earlier by ten minutes than he would have been had he not counted . But he was disappointed when neither Dutch nor Lena seemed to be aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's talk about their little mystery , let it be known that Delano was not to be discussed all day . Last night , Ray remembered , he had worked to keep the man out of their minds . Today he did n't know what else he could chatter about ; and he did n't know how he could pass the hours without chatter . But Lena preferred to be busy with the month 's bills , and Dutch remained in a morose stupor by the radio , the inanity of whose music , played in this barely audible way , irritated Ray and drove him to the company of the cabins . There was some sort of relevance in the music which he could not define andP182which he decided to put out of his thoughts if he could . He could , too , in the cabins , or farther down along the rectangle of grass  --  he wished it needed cutting . He wished he could go all the way down , even to Number 20 , and trim the neat green stuff with the patience of old gardeners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning sun . At least in books . In books . If he could ever read again . At least today he could not . Today , though , there was this high sun to stare at after the last guests had gone away ; to stare at , and to feel , warm on his stooping hack , whenever he paused in his rounds to pick up something Irom the ground . It was such a friendly and obliterating sun that he passed as much as possible of the afternoon lying between two of the cabins so that the warmth and brightness of the sky could shed themselves full on his face . He would keep his eyes open for a while  --  counting indeed the number of seconds during which he was able to do so  --  and then close them quickly , observing the afterimages . Sometimes they were concentric circles of every color , expanding and contracting , holding their own a moment , hovering there in a great disk over his head , then bursting and retreating downward to the horizon where they disappeared . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was better now . It served a purpose . Those rings were saving him from something else , obliterating another set of darker and smaller and more insistent images . P183Then it ceased to be vast rings of orange and purplethat he saw . Now it was the sun itself , the cause and comer of so much brilliance round the sky ; the sun itself , a smaller thing when it came to him this way , with his eyes closed ; a smaller and a darker thing , which bored into his brain as he watched it , fascinated , and became obscured here and there with patches of dead gray . He jumped to his feet as the shadow of Number 9 shot over him , and stared with a new eagerness at headquarters , at the walls of the two cabins between which he stood , and then at the woods beyond them . He stared at every familiar object he knew , desiring that it return to him in its old identity , its commonplace , crude color , its man-made form . But wherever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes ; and when he turned them toward the woods again the disk became a face which gazed at him without any other expression than one of bewilderment because of the blotches which it wore , it seemed to say , without knowing why . He ran to Dutch and Lena like a child to its parents . " Goodness gracious , but you 're fidgety today ! " Lena concealed a little sympathy beneath her surprise . " Be yourself , kid . I ) utcli 'll think you saw him . " " Saw whom ? " Ray stared at her , studying her face . It had not changed.  | " Lightfoot Delano , of course . The Whiff of Mystery . The  --  " " Oh , him . No . I have n't seen anybody . " " A person would swear it 'd been something . " " I guess I 'm restless . " " I guess you arc . If it 's work you want , you can help me unpack this carton . " Ray welcomed the employment , but it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face among the leaves , so that when he went out again  --  suddenly disliking the confinement of a room  --  he looked again , only to find that it had disappeared . Its absence disturbed him at first no less than its presencehad clone ; until it occurred to him that he should be glad it had not been Lucy 's face . No , it had not been hers . Hers was n't coming back to him as it had come last night . He grew conscious then of the resolve he had been making all day . When he saw Lucy  --  and it would be soon now  --  he must not be changed by anything that had happened , this day or any other day . He tried to avoid putting it in another form . She must not be changed . She must show nothing of the state to which his mind and eyes had reduced her last night . He tried not to say it this way . But even as he approachedher where she stood smiling at him by the gate he heard himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw , she must not be corruptedin herself . It is I who have been corrupted . P185Let me not see , then , any least sign on her , for it is daylight now , or almost daylight , and anything I see will actually be there . " Ray ! How you do stare at me ! I 'm Lucy Mount , you know . I live here with my aunt , Mrs. Esther Milton . What 's your name , stranger ? " Was it as funny as that , or did every syllable she said have a forced sound ? He wondered . He could not tell . " You object to the way I look ? " He studied his voice . " All right  --  " and he tried to smile  --  " I 'm Ray Slode , and I live  --  " " Oh , Ray . Come here and kiss me , and do n't keep all this distance between two friends . " " Very well , Miss Mount . " But struggle with his feet as he would he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway ? Not her face , which was more sweet and clear than ever . No , not her face . But the whole girl , the dress , the ground beneath her , and the air around . They were tainted  --  and so subtly , with such a devilish faintness , like those tracings on gray paper which water will bring out , but which until then are scarcely more than lines and spates for the imagination , peering at the paper , to suspect . Particularly if you have been told they are there , as in this case , last night and today , lie had been told " Ray ! I never asked you . Are you well again ? To think I had n't asked you ! " " Perfectly well . "   " Was I all right last night ? I wanted to be , but I 'm afraid I kept you at the spring too long . I was very stupid . Did you mind ? Did you hold it against me ? " " Certainly not . " " You sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . Well , I can come to you . " He stepped backward before he realized that he did so ; and saw die terror in her face . " I 'll come in a minute , " he said , pleading that she should understand . " Do n't be afraid , Lucy . " " But  --  but  --  " and her voice had shrunk almost to nothing  --  " you 're afraid . " " No , I 'm not . " " What is it , Ray ? What is it ? Is it something here  --  at home  --  in Windless ? Is that why  --  " " Nothing . " " I 'll stay till you tell me , though of course you want me to go . " " I do n't . " " You do n't know you do . But you do . Oh ! " she moaned , " I had it all fixed to tell you about Louise 's visit . She came this afternoon . She was very nice . It was like old times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't . " " Yes . I 'd stay if I could , if I had the strength , if  --  " She was gone , weeping . And still he could not move forward to the place where she had been .   THE WOODS THIS MORNING WERE COLD WITH SOMEthingother than the customary dew , and they were streaked with other shadows than those long ones which the oaks and locusts made . Ray , moving with an awareness which he would have liked to put asleep as he had put himself asleep last night  --  slowly , and with the last effort of his exhausted will  --  wondered how much of all this was there and how much of it he had brought with him . He did not need to wonder , for he knew ; or at any rate he thought he knew that it was entirely within himself , this film of gray , this damp exhalation of decay which rose from every object as soon as his eyes enclosedit . He wondered nevertheless , and asked himself with incomprehensible deliberation : Has the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I get there ? The worst thing that had happened to him yet was the detachment with which he stated his new problem . It should have been unthinkable for him that Lucy this morning might show on her lace , on her dress , on her forearms , in her hair , around her eyes , the quality which his dream had put there night beforelast  --  if it was a dream  --  and which his wakingP188eyes had divined there as a sort of invisible tracery last evening . It should be so awful , he said , that I would stop right here and go back , idling the time away until it was proper to appear at the camp . Yet he was marching on , across the highway and down the gravel road ; coming nearer and nearer every minute to a house where it should be impossible for him to look at what was there for him to see . He would look , all right , and he would see . The certaintyof this was somehow mingled with his curiosity ; and both were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it was impotent to halt him . Again he remembered the little book whose blank gray pages had so fascinated him and Hen when they were boys . It had found its way into the house from no one knew where , and days had gone by before Roger had suggested that water would bring out a pretty picture from each leaf . Then he and Hen , proceeding with the heartless celerity of children , had got the water and rubbed it on with a rag ; and the pictures had come magically forth  --  a lamb from one page , a tiger from another , a donkey , a locomotive , and a herd of cows ; and from the last page a fat little girl with a great doll in her arms . They had proceededheartlessly to expose these mysteries . Yet why not heartlessly ? Why use the word at all , since there had been no reason for their not doing what they did ? Indeed the book had been made for such a purpose . Heartlessness was something else  --  was whatP189worked in him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fascination which he felt as he stepped nearer and nearer to a sight which two or three days ago would literally , he thought , have put out his eyes . Not that he knew what he would see , either . Not exactly . It was rather that he seemed not to mind what he should see ; that the eagerness with which he advanced to investigate was in no way altered or lessened by his love for Lucy . It was simply that he could not have stayed away from her house if he had tried . And he had not tried , nor was he trying now . He was going to see whether the night , and perhaps her tears , had not brought everything out with a dreadful clearness . Lucy was not outdoors yet . The chickens ran to meet him with a foolish clucking and cheeping which ceased as soon as they recognized him for a stranger , and as soon as their heads , turned quizzically on their ruffled necks , told them he carried no vessel of white corn . He watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked without hesitation to Aunt Esther 's kitchen door , which opened before he touched the knob . Aunt Esther , her hair so smooth and her face so composed that Ray wondered on the instant whether she ever went to bed and suffered the indignity of disarrangement , greeted him without surprise . " Lucy 's not up , " she said . " But come in , child.  | Male child . It 's all the better this way . You can go up and wake her . " " Do you think she 's asleep ? " Ray knew he was going up , and he distinctly caught in his own voice the note of triumphant irony . Of course she would not be asleep . He had asked the question only because she could n't be . " Why not ? " It was as if Aunt Esther had answered the unspoken thought , not the spoken . " Why not , in your great wisdom ? To be truthful , she probably is n't , though I can certify that she did sleep last night . Butt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it where the sun never settles the waves . Lucy has drifted into such a region . And so have you , young man . The two of you , lashed together , have drifted to the same stormy spot . You think otherwise . You thought you heard the ropes break . But they did n't . Go up , child , and examine every strand . Then both of you head back to some safe port . The course of true love never did run well before the wind . You babies have had it too easy . Too monotonous . I am not sorry for a disturbance in the weather . But it has lasted long enough to teach you something . Tack back with all your skill , and soon you 'll see the lights burning brightly along a calm coast . " Ray had scarcely heard her , but he asked from the bottom of the stair : " Are you a lighthouse ? " " I am a foghorn . " Her silence as she retreated into the kitchen was almost as deep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , hoarse blast of a sea horn has ended . But he was not interested in her croaking . He had to ascend these stairs now and investigate something in Lucy 's room . He had never been there , yet he knew every turn in the house from Lucy 's descriptions of it . Yes , this was the landing ; and thenHer door was open as Aunt Esther , probably , had left it on her way downstairs . For she would have stopped and looked in . Ray , remarking to himself how little he hesitated , advanced to where , bracing his hands against the frame , he could prove the realityof something he once had merely dreamed . If it had been a dream . Nothing , however , had led him to foresee that she would be lying thus on her side , her face away from him , her legs drawn weakly up into the position of completest rest . He could tell that this was so , for the crumpled sheet which she had pulled into a semblance of smoothness over her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ray said , so that if he came a little closer he would be able to look through it to the spreading horror of which his mind had been so certain ever since he woke up an hour and a half ago . But he could not go any closer . It was the first time he had been stopped since the march of curiosity began . And then he understood why . It was because she did not know of his presence in the doorway , and because she kept her back turned to him as she never in all their days together had done . It had always been so much the other way  --  Lucy running to meet him , seeing him before he saw her , standing there so frankly and unguardedly before him , pressing herself against him ; anything but this , he said . It was something , perhaps , that he saw nothing yet of the thing he had come to see . The sheet might have been something other than this unbroken white ; it might have been covered over with great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost certainly was , and as the flesh beneath thatI-Ier suddenly turning and facing him disproved first of all his feeling that she had been unconscious of him there . And for a confused second he supposed that it disproved his dream . If it had been a dream . No ! It had not ! Nothing was disproved ! The fact that nothing was visible on her face and down her shoulders disproved only the theory that a deathly design would be visible . That it was not seemed suddenlymuch worse . For now Ray knew that she would always be to him this blank gray page from which pictures remained ready to emerge . They would always be coming , always be coming . It suddenly seemed to him much worse that this should be so . He lost none of his coldness at the thought . He stood there as deliberately as ever , watching her in her bare room as if she were a specimen laid out for him to examine . But the strength of purpose which had driven him to the house and which had filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that he stood now like a hollow man , staring at a figure of pale straw whose meaning he recognized only through an interval of numbness . " Ray ! " She was trying to sound surprised and glad . " Aunt Esther told me to come up and wake you , " he said . " She says you do n't love me any more . " " She is waiting to get your breakfast . " " She even says I do n't love you any more . " " I have no appetite myself , but I said I would call you . As soon as you come down she will be ready . I 'll go back now . " " Ray ! " But he had found himself turning away , and now he was halfway down to the hall at the far end of which he thought he could hear Aunt Esther listening . " Ray ! Wait just a minute ! " He caught the small sound of Lucy 's feet on the floor and almost raced to the front door so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached his side . It was Aunt Esther , however , who reached his side first , and even though she did not extend a hand to hold him he was unable to descend the three steps to the grass before Lucy was there too , hanging on the rusty knocker and entreating him to look at her . " Children , " said Aunt Esther , " this is not so unfortunateas you think . It has happened before . It happened between my man and me five times before I married him . It was the sign that cables had fas- tened us together , not ropes . Only one thing could be unfortunate , and that is that you should not continue to meet each other wherever it is that you do meet each other . Where is it ? " Neither of them answered . " Where is it ? " The question came out of her almost like a hiss , so that both of them trembled ; but they did not answer . " I see . It 's none of my business . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a meeting place , and since you know perfectly well where it is , I command you both to be there this evening . Make it well before ( lark , say half past six , so that what wits you still possess will be about you . If it is dark inside you , as I see it is , let it not be dark outside as well . Do you hear me ? " If they did they made no sign , for Lucy still clung to the knocker as Ray , staring at the tears which stained her face so that a pattern appeared there , glistening in the sun , turned all at once and descended to the grass . " I think you have heard me . And I am confident you will do what I have said . Remember , Ray . Half past six . And at the place where this girl has gone every evening since God knows when . Come in , girl , and drink my coffee . Yours will be ready later . You 'll need both cups . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlatchthe gate at the far end of the lawn . P195DUTCH MET HIM AT THE DOOR OF HEADQUARTERS , brushing a dozen torpid flies from the screen as Ray came slowly on to open it . " Something wrong ? " " No , " said Ray . " You 're acting funny these days . " " So are you . " " That 's right , " said Dutch , sighing as he looked past the counter into the empty kitchen . " We 're both affected . She is n't , but that 's because she 's made of something else . If you ask me what it is , I do n't know . But Lena 's not here this morning . Had to go see her mother over in Harlan . Ever see her  --  Mrs. Coons ? " " No . " " Just like Lena . But , say , we got a job . I called Donaldson the first thing after I woke up , and he says to go ahead and pack Delano 's stuff . He 's comin ' after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's one thing Delano forgot to leave behind him . I 've kinda been lookin ' for it in the mail . Guess he could n't afford to give away where he is , though , and anyhow he would n't care a damn whether we got it or not . " " No . Do I need to help you ? " " You sure do . What do you mean by that now ? P196Think I want to poke around down there by myself ? Fact is , I like this job and I do n't . I 'll be glad to be rid of everything , and see Number 20 like it was ; but then I do n't cotton to the idea of foldin ' them clothes . " " We wo n't need to be so neat . I 'm ready if you are , " said Ray as naturally as he could , leading the way out of headquarters . It was plain to him that he must seem no more reluctant than Dutch was to visit the cabin , and this meant that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to realize what lay ahead of him . Even then , Ile said , he could take pleasure in the thought that in another hour the cabin would actually he empty , with the suitcases piled outside of it , in the rumble of the car , and the car waiting for Donaldson to drive it off . He hoped Donaldson would come when he had promised . For when there was no car there either , and when it had become certain that no policeman would arrive from Allfield again in connection with the case  --  why , then things might be different , not only here at the camp but everywhere . " Come on , " he urged Dutch over his shoulder . " If we have to do it let 's be quick . " " All right , " said Dutch , with not too strong a voice . " But I do n't like it much . " " Neither do I. That 's why I 'm in a hurry . " The car rested as if forever on its springs , and alternating coats of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it without a word and went into the cabin , Dutch trailing behind as far as he could . " God , " said Dutch as Ray spread an open suitcase on the bed . " I do n't like it . After all these days  --  " " It 's not so many . " " It 's a million . Everything lays out so kinda flat , as though it did n't belong to anybody . " " Is n't it better that way ? " " I mean , like he was dead , and we was buryin ' him in these clothes . " Ray worked rapidly , restricting his attention to each garment as he reached it ; pretending that each object was the sole reason for his being there , bent over the bed , folding and stowing away . When the first bag was full and he could close it with two clicks of the brass catches , and when after that he straightenedup to lift it off the bed , he found that his back ached from so much concentration ; and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all exceptstand stupidly at his side . It was a relief to feel angry at Dutch , as he unreasonably did . " Are n't you going to help ! " he cried . " Are you going to stand there the whole tune ? " " I believe I am , " said Dutch sadly . " I believe I am . I never knew how hard it would be , Ray . " " I did . " Ray lifted another bag to the bed and began filling it . " I did . " " You 're prob'ly right . You 're smarter than me any- way . I 'd even go back and leave you , I 'm so weak , but I promised Donaldson I 'd see everything done . " " You 're seeing it . " " Yes "  --  Dutch was recovering himself now  --  " and who 's the boss around here ? Who 's got a better right to see ? " " All right . " The work went on , and in another ten minutes the last container had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car , saying as the top of the rumble cane down with a deep sound of metal : " Now , Ray , you straighten things around a little in there while I go up and see if Donaldson 's come . " " No , no ! " Ray ran after him and caught his shirt sleeve . " Why ? What ? " " We 'll both go in . I 'll straighten up , but you will watch me . I  --  you see  --  " Dutch 's grin was superior and free . " Yeh , I see . You 're afraid too . That it ? " " That 's it , " said Ray , " and I never denied it . " They re-entered the cabin , where Ray adjusted the bedspread and hastily swept the floor with a stiff new broom he brought from headquarters . Now everything was as it had been , and the slam of the door behind them as they came out was all at once crisp music in his ears . He went briskly about his other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depart/ing tourists . He interested himself in the minutest particulars as to where they were going now , and how far they expected to get today if the roads through the mountains were good enough . He lied with a fine readiness to one woman who wanted to be told what he and Dutch had been doing in the last cabin . " Is that the place I heard about in Windless ? Or , no , it was the town east of that . The place where a man " No , you 've got it wrong . This is a lady . She 's not well , and we packed for her . She 'll be leaving as soon as she can . " It was easy to say such things ; and it was not as difficult as he had supposed to spend the morning away from Dutch , working by himself at tasks whose variety seemed able to absorb the whole of his attention . If Lena had been on hand he might have passed his time differently . But not so easily , he said  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strange officer from their car , and leading them with something of a swagger to the cabin where he had been so uncomfortable two hours ago . " Did you pack everything ? " asked Donaldson . " Yes , sir . " " All right . Dave , you seal the suitcases while I see if this key works . It was hell to get it  --  these foreign makes . " Ray watched him at the switch , and smiled quietly as the key slipped into its place .   " How is the woodsman ? " asked Donaldson . " Still crafty . " Ray answered the thin grimace withone more broad at the corners of his mouth . " Sure you put everything in ? Did n't hook out a  --  " " No . We did n't want the stuff . " " Berger would n't . " " Neither would I. " The car sputtered and started , the exhaust stainingthe grass a sudden brown as Ray watched it , fascinated . " Good-bye , " he shouted . It was so good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaning back against the wall of Number 2o : I could stay here forever and feel perlectly safe . Even at night . Even with Lucy . But his eyes , returning to the brown stain on the grass where the exhaust had burned it , narrowed a little at the sight and lost some of their elation . The patch of brown  --  he felt his head turning on his shoulders so that he must look at the place among the woods where he had seen something round like this , and just about this size , so short a while ago as yesterday . It had been oval , rather than round , for it had been a face . Well ! It was not there today . He looked hard . It was not there . And yet his elation was gone . A person would thinkBut then he remembered how soon his gladness had left him after each of his former escapes from Donaldson . He remembered his discovery that thatp201was nothing ; not really an escape , not really a cure . There was something even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not touched in the least by what had happened since he arrived at the camp . It was , of course , Aunt Esther 's command that he meet Lucy at the spring at half past six . Not that he had forgotten her words , for it seemed to him now that they had been ringing at the back of his head all morning ; but now he must put his mind to them and decide whether he was going to be able to obey them . Lucy would , he said . She would be there , no matter how miserably the day was going for her . He shut his eyes at the thought of her day with Aunt Esther in a house from which she used to escape so joyfully to him . To him , who now could only wince at the memory of so much joy ; who stood here like a condemnedman , not knowing when he must die . And how to spend the six hours ahead of him , even granted that he could go ? Granted , he said , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his will , and granted that he could cease to remember those tracings beneath the surface of Lucy 's skin ; and granted that the man would refrain from standing up and staring at him  --  or no , at himself , in a gray bewilderment  --  as he went : to keel ) the appointment . How to spend six hours ? If only Lena would come back suddenly from Harlan . Ile would ask her everything about her mother ; he would keep her tongue going all afternoon ; he might even beP202able to forget the hour , and have therefore to hurry at the last second , so that when he arrived he would be out of breath , and Lucy would need to begin talking . He almost heard her say his name , and the faint sound reminded him of the last evening they had said things to each other in this cabin against which he leaned . Well , it was empty for them once more . It was absolutely empty . The fact revived in him like a young bird coming to life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluttered in him , clumsily at first , then flew  --  flew upward in fresh spirals , restoring his spirits to their old tone , he decided , as he argued with high case : Of course . Donaldson is gone . The car is gone . The cabin is empty of everything that could remind me . I saw nothing when I looked toward the woods ( he looked again , boldly , and again saw nothing ) . It 's all over . It 's over , and that can not help affecting everything from now on . It will affect Lucy because it has already affected me . I can go . It may be harder than I think , but I can go . Lena did not come home to help him with his afternoon . But he was so far from needing help that time went on wings for him until half past six , when with his hands clenched quietly at his sides he rounded the corner of Number 20 and started down the path to where the spring would be , he said , almost as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was easy to state this fact and to accept it , because the reason was so plain . She had been delayed . There had been work to do , or Aunt Esther had kept her talking longer than either of them realized , or  --  or she was not feeling strong tonight , and so would walk slowly . Not that she would want to walk slowly , for there was still power in these woods to make her feel afraid . But the conflict between weakness and fear might lead to long pauses during which she deliberated and did not move at all . It was not so easy to follow his thought this far , and Ray retreated to the simpler supposition that Lucy had been delayed . She would be coming soon , since it was impossible to believe otherwise ; since , for instance , it was impossible to doubt the final efficacy of Aunt Esther 's command . Aunt Esther had begun to assume a role which Ray struggled to understand . But no matter what the role , Lucy would obey the stern orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Esther also . It was not of her that he had come here to think , and it was not to her that he was ready now to say a certain thing . What it was he did n't quite know , yet P204clearly it was something to which Lucy was entitled . He had hurt her so deeply last night and this morningthat the hour of healing , the hour of candor  --  why , that was it , he said , endeavoring as he spoke the words to hold his afternoon 's elation , which threatened to slip away from him if he did not grasp it firmly . Yet he must not think in this direction either . Strange how his mind , starting forth on pleasant journeys , always became entangled in webs which it brought back with it , trailing there and blowing restlesslyabout until they became caught in the older ones , the number constantly increasing as if he were fated to sew himself into some kind of winding sheet which in time might leave him hopelessly bound . Strange that his high mood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of something else stitched in  --  the seams running out from the center with an undeviating regularity , and the center appearingnow to have been all along deceptive . For the core of his bright thought had not been anything like the sun . He saw it now , and knew it for that face , which glittered there and threw out long lines in which he was rapidly becoming so tangled that unless Lucy came soon , or his own feet could start going somewhere , he would be rooted where he stood like any rock . It was beginning to be dark , too . The sun must have set beyond the woods , for such light as there nowip205was seemed to come from everywhere . He must not wait too long . He could stand there a little while , but the momentum of his descent from the camp must not be entirely spent before the time came to go on and find Lucy and tell her what he was more and more harshly pressed to tell . It had been hard enough to start down the path from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got this far ; and it might be necessary to go much farther still . He had refrained up to this point from letting his eyes stray down the overflow . He might have to let them try it soon , if only to prove that they could come back to him unfrightened and unfilled . Better not , though , for once that had begun there might be woven a new tapestry in his mind , made up of all the things he had no wish to see . The needle of his thought would work and work , and he would find himself sewing at something more terrible than windingsheets . It was happening already . The advance of darknesshad not prevented the woods between him and the thicket from keeping a kind of transparency , as if a window had been cut through air and leaf . And now through this window , finely and smally , as if at ten times the actual distance , he saw the mail rise from his grave  --  rise to a certain height only , so that below his knees he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the puzzle of his restingplace . P206Ray would have run except that he had to look a little longer  --  saying to himself that the figure surely could not stand thus , watching itself , forever  --  and except that a light glowed at the man 's belt , finely and smally , as if a firefly had settled on him there . In the now almost complete darkness this was oddly fascinating ; it was a thing to fix one 's eyes on and identify ; and anyway it was only one of several lights that had begun to take their stations in the world of blackened trees . The others , though , could move , and did so slowly , like stars drifting dangerously close to the earth  --  small stars , caught in a foliage foreign to them and trying their best to get out again into a familiar endless night . Only one of them , slightly larger and the highest of them all , was immovable ; fixed in the crotch of a maple which Ray saw also , behind him when he turned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole congregation of lights began to move in a sluggish rhythm round and round him , leaving trails of phosphorescence which looked like seams in a huge garment , dusky and inescapable . He screamed without making much sound , and started running as under a blanket which threatened at every step to fall heavily about him . He reached the gravel road , where at his left the crotched maple showed only the faint remains of what had burned there when he looked ; he reeled to the right , following the road with an automatic certainty as to its every turn and depression ; he fled on and on towardp207Lucy 's house , saying to himself : I 'll not look at her , for fear  --  1 ' 11 not look at her while I tell her . The house seemed utterly dark , except that the back fence was in a dim way visible , and this meant a light of some sort in the kitchen . Ray ran that way then , and throwing himself against the kitchen door fell in upon the sight of two women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter what they thought . He must speak to the older and the taller one immediately , even before he had his breath , and even though he saw nothing clearly . " Aunt Esther ! Lucy did n't come . " " Are you my nephew yet ? But you 're correct . She did n't come . " " She did n't mind you . " " But she will . She did n't come , but she will go . I take it you want her to go somewhere now . " " Yes , yes ! Outside ! I have something to tell her . " " Doubtless . So there you are , Lucy . Go now . Go . " " No . " Ray heard the spent voice saying it almost against its will , and this gave him hope , although he could not look at Lucy . " Yes . " Aunt Esther and he said it together , and repeated it as if by plan . " Yes . " There was a long silence , broken only when Lucyslipped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There she is , boy . Follow her now and say it , whatever it is . Go far enough way to keep me fromhearing . You do n't know how loud you will be , andP208you do n't know how good my ears are . Too good , I 've thought . Run on . I 'll shut the door . " Lucy was standing in the dim light of the high window , holding as if for life to the wire netting beyond which the chickens could be heard stirring on their roosts . " Let 's go a little farther , " said Ray , unable to touch her yet but leading her with his voice to a place under the pear trees where she ceased to be visible altogether . " Now , " he said . " Ray "  --  he heard the effort of her voice  --  " Ray . Perhaps you 'd better not . " " But I 'm going to . " " Perhaps you 'd better not . I  --  I 'm afraid . " " This is to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there are too many fears . Can you be quiet awhile ? " She did not answer the question . " Do you want to know why I ca n't stay in Windlessany longer ? " She was completely still . " Do you remember the man who stopped you on the road and got out of his car and came after you when you ran ? " He heard nothing but her breath , which beat as if with wings in the total darkness . " Do you remember that this man was a guest at the camp ? Do you remember that he disappeared withinP209a few hours after you saw him , and within an hour after you told me you had seen him ? Do you re-member  --  " " Oh ! " She must have tried not to interrupt him . " Why do you keep asking me if I remember ? " " Do you remember that it was I who told you of his disappearance ? And told you not to be afraid ? And then became afraid myself ? Of the woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lucy , of you ? Do you remember the night we walked to Windless after some medicine for Lena ? Do you remember ? But Lena was n't sick . I was afraid . Of the woods , of the spring , of you . I lied to you so that I could keep away from the woods and the spring . There was something there for anyone to be afraid of if he knew about it . And I knew about it . I still do . And so will you , now . Lucy , going home that night after you told me about him he stopped me in the road and I  --  Lucy , without meaning to do anything and without knowing what I did I struck at him with my right hand and he fell . " He heard nothing but the stopping of her breath . " I waited for him to get up , but he did n't get up . He was dead . " She let out all her breath at once , and he thought she was trying to scream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was how he disappeared . He is gone forever . I  --  I buried him where he will never be found . Ip210know that because it has been proved . The police went with me , and he was not found . I understand that something else is more important in your mind , but let me tell you plainly that the man is gone forever . Gone , I tell you . Lucy ! " He had not heard her stepping away from him , but now he could stretch out one of his hands  --  the hand moved freely , for the blood was returning to the arm which moved it  --  and he discovered that she was not there . He listened an instant . She was creeping away from him like a small animal , close to the ground . Then he looked at the poor fan of light which spread from the kitchen window and fell weakly on the fence . There she was , moving swiftly now , bent over as if there were something under which she could not pass if she stood upright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . I can just get there , he said , in time to tell her one more thing , and in timeBut no , he said . I have done enough . I will let Lucy go in without me . He could not tell whether she opened the door with her own strength or whether it opened for her . At any rate it opened , and it seemed to him that she was almost transparent as she passed through the tall rectangle of lamplight .   HE AWOKE TO A MORNING WHOSE FINENESS PIERCED every wall of his father 's house like arrows that withdrew themselves to sing and fly again . He opened his eyes in a room every corner of which seemed to give back to him a clean and candidlook . He lay on his bed a moment , smiling and wondering in his bewilderment why he smiled ; then leapt to his bare feet , laughing nervously at the way the sun streamed so directly in through his low window . It poured in without any hesitation at all , searching for something white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh , where it piled itself up in silent breakers , saying : This can be looked at , it is whole and sound , there is no devil haunts this shore . Ray looked down at himself , bewildered again by the contentment which he felt ; and hurried out of the house to where the creek waited to bestow upon hint a final superfluous cleansing . But the first touch of the chill water was a shock to his still sleeping mind , and though he splashed mechanically with his accustomed vigor he could but grow steadily more conscious of the inert , unmeasured weight which he now realized had been pressing downward upon his thoughts all night . Even as he P212walked home from Lucy 's  --  yes , even then , despite his efforts to assure himself that something had at last been accomplished . But what had been accomplished except that Lucy had been turned by his voice into a small creeping animal ? He saw her now more clearly than he saw any of the shadows of early morning among these trees  --  shadows which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stared at them to become a hunched small creeping animals , splotched with irregular patches of gray and arrested only a moment in their process of flight from him . He saw them dimly , but Lucy was clear ; not as she might be now , but as she was last night , slinking away from him into the kitchen light , and slinking then from any light at all . He saw her staring at him from a little spot of darkness into which her shrunk figure had crept for safety ; so black a darkness , he said , that nothing might ever melt it into the light with which Lucy had always surrounded herself in his thoughts of her . He stood there , shivering , long after he should have stepped out and started for the house . The weight descended upon him with a double pressure : for him , for her . What he had unloaded upon her slight back in the darkness behind Aunt Esther 's house  --  what he had placed there , driven by his desperate need , had returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He frowned at the word . Scapegoat . But that was what he had tried to make her ; andP213even then he had failed . It was too soon for anything like that ; or if not too soon , then Lucy least of all was the creature upon whom he should have laid the dreadful burden . Lucy least of all . Lucy , who might at this very momentThe question of how she might be looking at this moment , and where she might have gone to hide herself , was the only thing that could have roused Ray from the stupor in which he had been standing . He knew what he must do , he said ; and retreated dully to the bank of grass where his clothes lay and from which a familiar path led back to the house . He must dress and look for Lucy , wherever she might be and whatever she might be thinking . Yet he walked slowly , lost in another question to which he had little hope of finding the answer . He had awakened with the illusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The beauty of the morning had deceived him ; the meretricious sun , streaming into the room where he had lain in his false innocence , had made that innocence seem real for an instant . It had tricked him into believing that he already possessed what now seemed forever impossible to recapture . Or was it impossible ? Might this present misery not be an illusion too ? Which world was true  --  the warm one or the cold one ? I low could he know anything this morning of what was true outside his shifting thought ? Flow could he be sure that Lucy had failed him ? It was possible thatp214his vision of her had tricked him as the morning had . Yet he walked slowly , groping his way through the light which played its deceptive whiteness over the poor sides of the house . Entering , he went wearily to wake his father , who blinked at him and brought out another question concerning the mystery at Windless Cabins . " You say they sent away his suits and everything  --  did you keep anything out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Ray shuddered at his temptation to answer : " Yes , a cigarette lighter , but I gave it to a tree . " He merely said : " No , nothing , Dad . Dutch was watching me . " " Hell , who was watching Dutch ? " " I was . So neither of us  --  " and the two stared at each other , neither of them , Ray seemed to hear the morning saying in his ears , changed in any respect from what he had been . As he waited by the stove for his coffee to boil he found himself reaching out an arm to catch Julia around the waist . She was on her way to the cupboard for spoons and saucers , and it appeared that she dislikedthe attention , for she drew herself out of his grasp with a sudden wriggle , scowling because Hen had seen it . But Ray did not mind this in the least ; nor did he mind Hen 's laughter , lingering about him all the while he made his meal of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said . He had touched his sister . And she had not changed . P215Had Lucy ? He asked the question dully , hoping for no clear answer from the woods through which he presently walked , noting with a kind of envy as he went how every tree and bit of underbrush containeditself within its lovely form . They stood there , growing about their business and waving to him as he passed . Neither had they changed , he said , nor did they wonder if they had . They were the same , and content to be the same as long as summer lasted . They waved there , sleeping in their forms ; happy to be ever sleeping beyond the borders of self-knowledge . He asked himself if Lucy had slept last night . Perhaps she had , after two or three unendurable hours . Perhapsshe had fallen into a deep sleep , and now , perhapsonly a few minutes ago , she would have waked up and would be waiting  --  he hastened his steps a little , though not much  --  to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how there was nothing any more about which it would be impossible to think . He said to himself that he did not believe this ; but even as he said it he increased his pace again . The crotched maple rose at his side , and he brushed his hand over its ridges as he went by , so casually that an observer of his progress would never have guessed that for him this was a special tree . There was no observer  --  not even a man off there to the right , half hidden in a thicket , looking clown as if he did not know that his chief business was to frighten Ray through the very circumstance of his being unable to look up . Ray could not see as far as the thicket , but he knew that there was no such man , and he did not hesitate to sweep the whole woods with his eyes as he went on past the spring path . He knew there was no such man ; and the knowledgegave him a sudden start , for it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much had gone with him ; if he had changed , then everything had changed , and into this worst of all things , this world hart en of meaning , this world of strange fresh woods through which Ray walked with a curious , a terrible lack of the power to feel anything at all . Even fear . Even fear , he said ; and hoped for an instantthat Lucy had kept at least that much . He would ask her to share it with him . He must hasten now and find her , and ask her for the return of what he had laid so thoughtlessly upon her shoulders last night . If he could ever see Lucy again he might begin to understand something . Now he understood nothing . And no wonder . For he could n't feel . It was necessarythat he see Lucy . Yet he told himself that he had no such expectation as he went on to where he could see that the unpaintedhouse was as quiet this morning as if it had been deserted even by its mice . Lucy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for she had not been out yet to feed her chickens and look at the gold sun on their backs . They tilted theirP217necks expectantly among the fennel , eying Ray withoutcuriosity as he walked past them to the kitchen door and slowly opened it . Aunt Esther did not turn from the stove where she was lifting the lid from a shallow pan . " Is that the blunderer ? " she asked . " It was , " said Ray , surprised at the quietness of his voice and at the ease with which he seemed to be denying all that was in his mind . " What has time done to change your tense ? I say you are a blunderer , and I say that what you told my girl last night  --  " " Did she tell you ? " But Ray realized that he was not afraid . " Naturally not . I would never have permitted it . I refer to the effect , which was as plain as lightning . " " And is ? " " What would time have done to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Has she come down yet ? " " No . " " Then I can bring her down , " and he started for the hall in stolid certainty of what Aunt Esther would say next . Yet he must make the move . " You can not , " said Aunt Esther . " Iler door is locked . She made me promise that as soon as I saw you on the road  --  " " You have been watching ? " He did not turn his head for her answer.  | " As soon as I saw you I was to call up and she was to lock her door . I did n't think the old key would work , but it did . And I did n't want her to do this . But I had promised . To be more truthful than you probably deserve , I did n't suppose you would come this morning . You would be ashamed . " Ray looked into the hall ahead of him a full minutebefore he acknowledged the question which he knew had underlain her scorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think I am not ashamed . I think I am not sorry for anything I have said to Lucy . In the long run , I think  --  " " You think ! But what do you know ? I 'm asking that . And what I want to hear is that you are n't sorry . Definitely not sorry , fool . For then  --  " " But I do n't know . And wo n't till I see her . Are you sure  --  " " I am . There is no use . Her father was just as stubborn , with more spunk to explain it . My advice is that if you have anything to do elsewhere you 'd better go and do it . Stay away for the day at least . " " And come tonight ? " " I said at least . Do n't take me for an oracle . " " But I do , Aunt Esther "  --  turning suddenly to examineher face . " You 're not my nephew . " " You said so last night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask . " His voice lost its levelness , rising to the question that had come into his mind , he said , top219save it . " Would she read a letter if I sent her one ? And would you slip it under her door ? " " If a letter came it would be my decent duty to deliver it . I ca n't say whether it would be - read . " " I think  --  I think I can . " " You think ! And they told me philosophy was dead . " " I think it would be read . " " Do n't stand there thinking like that ! Get along with you ! You 've got something better to do , if you only knew it . " " What is it , Aunt Esther ? " " Stop feeling sorry . But get along . Can bandits write ? " " Can oracles read ? " " Not other people 's letters . " " I did n't  --  " " Yes , you did . But get along ! " He backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would take him down to the gate . He did not examine the sky , he gave no thought to the chickens beyond their wire . He saw nothing but the path ahead , and down at the end the familiar pickets which soon would swing between him and Lucy . He paused once , turned , and looked up at her window . But the shades were drawn and he was sure that she did not stand behind them , stealing a glimpse of him as he stood there with his face becom/ing emptier every moment of the complacency with which the sun had painted it as he awoke . Perhaps , he said , it is not as bad as it might have been . She did n't come down , but then I did n't see her in a condition which it would be terrible for me to remember . And there is time . There is a whole day of time . A whole day . The words were immense in his mind  --  elongated to some vanishing point where they ran together in clear air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vacant air . He was reminded of the man who had vanished too , leaving these woods about him so barren of their old horror . It was madness to be homesick for horror . But it was a greater madness to be alone as he now was  --  entirely , meaninglessly alone . He went on through the indifferent woods , thinkingstubbornly of the letter he would write . P221AS SOON AS HE WAS FREE TO DO SO RAY BORROWEDsome sheets of paper and an envelope fromLena and sat down in Number 13 to write what might make all the difference in the world if it turned out as he hoped . The words came with difficultyat first , and did not say what he wanted them to say ; or if they conveyed his meaning they carried the wrong sound , as if too hard a voice were utteringthem . He began over and over again , tearing up so many sheets that he had to return for more , to Lena 's sympathetic amazement . Once it crossed his mind that the number of the cabin where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentences and roughening his tongue . But he rejected the excuse . Then he saw things a little more clearly , even if he could not say them . It was merely , he said , that such a letter would be difficult to succeed with in any case ; and all the more so because he had written so few of them in his life , either to Lucy or to anybody else . Only when he despaired of success , deciding that anythingwould do so long as it said what was uppermost in his mind , did he become lost in his task so that he wrote on and on : P222DEAREST LUCY : When this is slipped under your door you will say to yourself that you are never going to read it . But I shall be praying that you do , and even now I can believe that you will ; not because you should , or because I deserve that you should , but because you alwayshave been generous , and because you have allowed me to love you so much . It is because I never loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will read what I am writing . I could say it better if I saw you . I am not cornplainingbecause I could n't see you this morning . Maybe it was right that I could n't , and maybe if I were with you now I would be making a new mistake . Not that I know too clearly whether I made a mistake last night , or at any rate one that time will not take care of . Time is a long thing , Lucy . Too long at present . But later , maybeYet I am not counting on anything . All I want to tell you is that I had tried for days not to say what I did last night . I went around repeating to myself : Lucy must never know about this , I can keep it from her and I will . That was why I could lie to you a number of times ; and why I could seem to be heartlessmore than once when you asked me to be kind . But it was also why I had begun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you was impossible . I do n't mean , not to tell someone . I mean , not to tell you.  |p223Then  something happened which made me want to do it , and I did it . Aunt Esther showed me this morning at your house that she wanted me not to be sorry . I told her I thought I was n't . But I did n't know what I said . And I do n't know what I think . Except that it has not made me happy to unload so much of my burden on to you . When I woke up this morning there were a few minutes when I felt perfectly light and free . But only a few minutes . It has been the same way all week whenever I have thought I was safe from being discovered . I grew lighter for a while , but then the weight came back again , heavier than before . It is so heavy now that I do not know whether I can bear it . And it is heavy because I have given it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it back to me . What 's done is certainly done . But if I could see you I might find out whether there will ever be such a thing as our bearing it together . I am asking you to let me lift half of it away from you  --  the burden , I mean , of being safe , and of having to think about something all by ourselves all the rest of our lives . I hope I am not begging too much , or scaring you about myself . I am not insane . I am doing my work today . Nobody to look at me would think I was bearinganything , or not bearing it . You arc free to do what you think best . I am simply saying that it will be best for me , and maybe for you , if we meet tonight at the spring at half past six . I 'm not going to readP224this over . I 'm going to send it by the first boy who comes along , and at half past six I 'll be waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have written , be good to both of us and come . I wo n't go farther than the big rocks to meet you . If you 're not there I 'll consider that you 're not anywhere . I will abide by what you do . Only remember that there are things I ca n't understand without you to help me understandthem . And remember . It is not in order to be happy again that I want to see you . It is almost in order to be unhappy . To have my share of it back . But why am I telling this to you twice ? I 'll be there at half past six . RAY " Who 's all that to ? " asked Lena sharply , as Ray , exhausted from trying to remember what he had written , walked into headquarters with the sealed envelope in his hand . " Lucy Mount ? We know about Lucy . " " Please , Lena  --  " " All right . Of course we do n't know much . I just wanted to inquire whether it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em , so why could n't you write ' em ? " " I 'll be busy here all morning . Do you suppose Harvey or Ed or any of those nuisances will be along to take it for me ? Probably not , since we want them . " " We want them ! " " Well , or the vegetable truck . Has it been by ? " " No . You can trust Genvegli with the papers allP225right . Keep your eye peeled for him  --  or I will  --  and since he goes up that road it ought n't to be any trouble for him to serve ' em on the lady . " " I 'll watch for him . " " I thought it would be you . We 've got no reason to watch . " " Not that  --  " " Oh , no ! Go on , goose . I 'm not insulted . I was born day before yesterday . " Ray left her to do his rounds and to listen for the rattle of Genvegli 's motor , which sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down Lucy 's road . The letter was safe in Genvegli 's apron pocket , and Ray could only guess now what Aunt Esther would say to herself as she climbed the stairs with it . Unless Lucy had come down , and unless she should be the first to receive it in her hands . He decided not to guess concerning this or any other moment . There would be knowledge to be had at half past six ; even if Lucy did n't come , he said , that would be knowledge . And if she didHe decided again not to guess . There was his blessed work to do . And there was the Short History to pick up if by chance  --  but he knew he would not pick it up today . Today . An endless stretch of tune . And for a while he could occupy himself with lines that ran on ahead of him to a point where they vanished in clear and voiceless air . Nothing at the far end of them at all . And nothing at this end , either.  | He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fed him until last night . Was it insane , he wondered , to want to be afraid ? Had he been right in reassuring Lucy ? Was he insane in the worst way of all  --  the dry way , the empty way ? When he realized that such questions raced off into nonsense he restored himself a little with jobs of his own desperate devising . He washed all the mirrors in the cabins  --  even in Number 20 , where he saw nothing but his own expressionless face in a square of glass that might have looked at him , he said , more strangely than it did  --  and carved on each cake of soap down the line two words which it was possible to keep going in his mind : WINDLESSCABINS . Then suddenly it was six , because the shop siren in Windless was singing the hour in his ears  --  with an unnatural loudness , he said , but that would be on account of his having waited all afternoon for no other sound . He would n't wait any longer . Rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early . And it would be important to learn whether he could sit comfortably at this place , among these rocks , where only twenty-four hours agoIf he could only be afraid , he said , rubbing the corner boards of Number 20 as he passed and countingthe dozen steps that took him to where the path ran narrowly before him down to the spring .   HE HAD NOT BEEN EARLY ENOUGH , FOR LUCY WAS there . And so unprepared was he for the sight of her , sitting where she commanded a view of the path down which he came , that he stopped dead , doubting his eyes . It was easier to doubt them because of the way she sat without seeming to know he had arrived . The evening was still and cool , so that she wore a blue wool coat whose bulk increased the tenuousness of her figure  --  wrapped in it as if away from the world . What should he say before he came closer ? She seemed so unconscious that he stood there , although her eyes at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet anything might serve . " I thought I was early , " he began , his Voice soundingfar away to him , as if it came from outside the woods . " You are , " she said . " But you couldn't. have been as early as I was . You had things to do . I had nothing , so I have been here all afternoon . " She might have spoken in these tones to anybody coining by . " All afternoon ! While I worried up there about whether you would come at all ! " Such exclamations were stupid , he said , but for the moment they must do . " I thought for hours about it . " " I have been thinking about my father . " " Not about  --  " " Yes , you too . The same thing , I almost decided . Sit down here by me where you wo n't be staring at me that way while I tell you something . " He came and sat down within easy reach of her toneless voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wool . " I used to spend many hours here , " she said , " trying to convince myself that there was nothing in my father to be afraid of . My fear of him made him angry . This increased the fear , yet at the same time I seemed to know that he was right . So I sat here trying to understand him . But I never did . " " I am sorry for him . " " That puts it mildly for me . " There was a long silence before he said : " You were thinking of me , too , and it was the same thing . " " That 's right . I have been working very hard to believe you wo n't be angry  --  " " Lucy ! You 're going to be afraid ? " " Going to be ? I am , and I have been for days . What you said last night was only the finish , the explanation . My fear has been  --  and is  --  that I wo n't know how to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Of something in you , Ray , that I wo n't be able to understand . " " Not even  --  " " Not even after you have said everything that is possible for you to say . I believe what you have said already , and I will always believe you . It 's the fact that there will be something left over in your mind about it , something I do n't share with you , something I ca n't help you keep down where it probably belongs . Something for which there are n't any words , any human sounds at all . For that very reason I will be afraid of it  --  afraid , I mean , that my fear of it will grow to a point past which it will be unendurable for you . For you , I say , not me . It will be a secret that ca n't be told , even though each of us wants it told ; but it will be your secret more than mine . You asked me in your letter to give something back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You did n't let me have it all . You could n't . And you  --  you never can . My part of it ? Of course not . I can never give that back . " Ray sat with a strange quietness , staring ahead of him and listening to the life come once again into her voice . " Lucy , Lucy ! " he cried at last . " To think that I should have given you any part of it ! Any part ! " " But that 's not it ! " She had risen suddenly , and he became aware that she was trembling violently by his side ; and when he looked at her he knewp230that tears were coming to her eyes . " That 's not it ! " " Then  --  " " I want it all , Ray . You will have to tell me everything . You will have to say everything . " " But  --  " Then the tears came , and she clung to him as if for very life . " Do n't you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying . Both of us . We 're lying . We 're talking only about ourselves . It is n't ourselves we are thinking about . Not really . It 's  --  it 's  --  " " It 's  --  " " Him ! " And she sat weakly down again , Ray dropping to her side as if from a blow that had stunned him . " But I have thought of him . " " No . You have been trying to . But you have been trying even harder to think of me . And of yourself . And so have I. This fear we 've been talking about  --  that 's not important . Nor is it important what I ever think and do again , nor what you do . The important thing is something else  --  is this . He  --  he was alive , Ray . Breathed and walked , and had a name . " " Delano . " Ray spoke the syllables as if in a trance . " Yes , I know . I found out . I have whispered it to myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several faltering steps away from her . " I did n't have to do that , " he said . " It whispered itself to me . Several times . And once hers did . "   " Hers ? " " His wife 's . " Lucy drew the blue coat closer about her knees . " Did you see her ? Did you have to  --  " " No . I wanted to and I did n't want to . After she had left , and when I heard Dutch and Lena talking about her the way they did , her name came to me too . Almost as if you spoke it . " " It was n't me , Ray . " " I know . " And he came back to her side . " It was the important thing trying to express itself . You were trying hardest then to remember what you had done . " She spoke slowly now , as if to herself , but with an emphasis not to be missed . " A man with a name and a wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter  --  for who knows ? Killed without the thought to kill , and killed when there was no need , no need . But that does not matter either . What mattersis that we murdered him , that we murdered him , that we murdered him ; and that we have not told ; and that if we do not tell he will keep on living in us as long as we live . " Ray 's voice , reaching her after a long silence , was husky and barely audible . " Tell ? " he said . " That was what I really thought about last night and this afternoon . Yes . Tell . " A sudden rush of strength to Ray 's heart lifted him to his feet once more , and he paced rapidly back and forth in front of Lucy as she sat with her head sunkp232unnaturally toward her knees . Tell ! Tell ! It was a ringing word , and to shout it to himself this way brought a kind of relief which he had not known since  --  since " Lucy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can do it . Not you . There 's nothing for you to say . I can do it , I can do it ; and you wo n't even have to go with me . Do you hear ? I can do it . " But she did not seem to hear , and her silence , with her head still hanging there in that unnatural way , brought hint to a halt before her . " Lucy , " he said . " Lucy , did you hear ? " She raised a face upon which new perplexities were written , and a new horror . " No , Ray , " she said . " What is it then ? Are you afraid ? Of this ? " But he was immediately ashamed . " Not of this . Not of anything , I think . Merely that we are n't ready yet . Neither of us . A minute ago I gave the wrong reason for doing it . The words slipped out  --  that he would keep on living in us . As if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . The horrible thing is that I thought so . And that you  --  now  --  are still thinking about yourself , about how happy you would be , how free and light , if you went somewhere and told . But he  --  he 's still there . Doing it for that reason would n't help him , would n't keep him alive . We 've got to keep him alive in ourselves awhile yet , Ray ; and we 've got to wantp233to . Maybe  --  I do n't know  --  as long as we live . Maybe we should never tell . Maybe . " Ray trembled all at once with the vision she had offered him ; but the trembling served to bring him closer to her than he had been , and he could say , staring down at her and speaking with a voice which penetrated to her inmost mind at last : " Then I will know that you are afraid , and I will never ask you not to be . Nor will you ask me , for you will know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't be even sorrow . There is n't a name for it . But each one of us will be at the root of it in the other . And we wo n't pull it up , we wo n't disturb it . We 'll put the earth back over both of us and leave us there  --  growing together in that dark place , growing up and up until we stand in the light and do n't have to speak concerning what is down there any more than plants have to remember the darkness , the dampness , and all the rotting things that give them life . Our life , Lucy , will depend on something beneath the surface which is more terrible and sad than words can say . I will never pretend otherwise , and neither will you . We 'll never deny that sadness , which will be neither my secret nor yours , but our own together , our  --  " " Do you mean  --  " " What is it ? I can talk now . " " Do you mean that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " He was excited with his certainty . " Asp234often as it is necessary to live . For we can live , Lucy , and we must . It 's merely that we wo n't deny either our fear or our remorse . I say our because you did . I  --  " " Yes . We . But are we  --  Ray , are we strong enough ? Has anybody ever been strong enough ? " She looked at him so imploringly that a wave of pity rushed over him and he bent to embrace her . But she stood up and held him away . " No , Ray , we 've got to do something else first . " " Anything . " " Do n't be too sure , " she went on slowly , her face turned from his . " Where is he ? " The question , coming so quietly , was nevertheless a blow from which he did not recover in time to answerher . " Where is he ? " " You mean  --  " " Where is he buried ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must n't be safe from me . From us . You 've got to take me there now and  --  " " No ! " Ray was trembling again . " I ca n't do it . " She took his pale face in her hands and held it there until she found his eyes . " Yes , you can . " " Yes , " he said ; and walked suddenly away from her , trusting her to come too as he followed the overflowdown to the last bend in the rocky path before they should both be in full sight of the thicket . Here he hesitated , but only for an instant , and he couldp235hear that she hesitated too . Then he went on , and stopped at the place where he had turned in with his burden on that night  --  he stopped and looked around at her . There was horror in her face because he had stopped , and her eyes were already directed as if by instinct into the center of the thicket , whose ferns and willows rose in the windless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . He marveled that he could go in . But it was more marvelous that she could follow , as he knew she did , and that when they stood at last on opposite sides of the grave she should be able to lift her eyes so steadily to his . " Is this all ? " he asked her , for he did not know how long they could stand thus . The question , feebly as it came from him , broke so much silence that he was almost frightened by the echo of her answer . " Is this all ? " She was looking down again , and she repeated his question with exactly the same inflection he had used , as if some ritual had been begun . " No , " she said . " No , " said Ray after her , bending his head as she did hers ; but closing his eyes . " It is our secret , " she went on . " It is our secret , " said Ray . " And our sorrow . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this man to life and light  --  " She paused.  | " If we could restore this man to life and light  --  " " We would do so at the cost of our own breath . " " We would do so . " She waited until he finished . " At the cost of our own breath . " " Since it is we who live  --  " " Since it is we who live  --  " " We shall go on living  --  " " We shall go on living  --  " " Nourished by our fear  --  " " Nourished by our "  --  he looked over at her , and seeing that she was not afraid he added  --  " fear . " " And by our sorrow . " " And by our sorrow . " " And free from anger . " " And free from anger . " He shuddered at the sudden silence and opened his eyes again . She was making a slow gesture with her hand , as if she would smooth the mold above the long ridge between them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place where they had halted to enter the thicket . Here without looking behind her she turned again and started up the overflow to the spring . Ray , following her swiftly , saw her waver on her feet and reach for the support of a young ash whose trunk was no thicker than his own arm . His mind cleared as if some light had broken in it , behind his eyes , and he was by her side before she could fall . " Lucy ! " he cried . She had not fainted , but wasp237looking wearily into his face as he bent over her , his arms warm about her waist . Then at his touch she collapsed into a torrent of tears , her whole body shaking so that he wondered at his power to hold her . It was the strength he needed for this , he said , which saved him from shaking too  --  more violently than she , for the light that had burst in him was shedding a kind of solemn joy over every inward portion of his being , a joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were it not for the pricelessburden in his arms . Suddenly she quieted and stared at him , her wet eyes wide with some deep concern . " Ca n't you cry too ? " she asked , lifting her one free hand and running it over his face . " I can , Lucy , " he said , " and I am . But you do n't see it . It takes another form . " " For men ? " " For me . The form  --  will you understand this ?  --  of joy . " She straightened in his arms and dazzled him with such a smile as he had never seen . " I understand , " she said . " And approve ? " " And approve . " He carried her lightly to the spring , where they sat down together and gazed into the increasing dusk . " Lucy , " he said after a while . " Yes . "  | " There is n't much time . We 're leaving Windless , remember . Did you believe it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if this happened . And it has . " She looked around at him , her seriousnesssearching every inch of his face . " I love you , Ray . " " Poor dear . . . . Well . When ? And how ? " " Tomorrow ? " " Lucy ! " " But there 's Aunt Esther . It will take time for me to make up my mind to run away from Aunt Esther . It would n't he anything I could tell her . " " What would n't ? " " That I was going . " " Tomorrow would n't be worse than the next day , or the next . I say tomorrow night . " " Ray . " " Yes , darling . " " Let me decide . I find I ca n't think of anything now except how she will look when she sees me  --  well , happy again . You know why I say happy . " " For the same reason that I said joy . " " Yes . It 's strange , but she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ split . " " It always was , I think . I 've always loved her . But I 'm no good for deciding tonight , Ray . I 'm  --  I believe I 'm tired . " " Poor Lucy . " " No , rich . " " But the rich have their troubles . "  |p241not  come for that . He told himself that if Dutch and Lena were more talkative tonight he might think steadily of -- of him  --  behind the screen of their words . But they maintained one of their silences , at least to Ray . Once or twice it occurred to him that they maintained it only for him , because there was the air about them of a suspended interest whenever he returned from one of his tasks outside . Lena 's only question was a queer one , he thought . " How long has Mrs. Milton been as old as she is now ? " She looked up from Dutch and asked him this as he came in with a light bulb that had burned out in the sign . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a dark corner of the room why they should be thinking of Aunt Esther . " Neither does anybody else , " said Lena , and laughed a little . " We hear she 's always been this old , and we thought you might know if she was born that way . " " If you 've heard such a thing , " said Ray , " it only means that people know she 's remarkable . People do n't know what to think of her , and so they say these things . " But neither Lena nor Dutch seemed to he interested in the theory . Why , he wondered , had they been thinking about Aunt Esther ? And then he remembered his letter to Lucy . Of course Lena had told Dutch about that ; and it would have been anp242easy step to gossip concerning the house to which they knew he went so often . " We know about Lucy , " Lena had thrown at him this afternoon . Perhaps they talked a good deal about him and Lucy . Perhaps everybody in Windless did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which got in the way of his remembering him . Still another one had to do with the probability that this was Ray 's last evening at the camp . If Lucy  --  if tomorrow noon  --  should things turn out as they ought to , this was his last long evening with Dutch and Lena , for tomorrow night he would be busy with his plans . His plans ! He remembered that he had none ; and remembered at the same moment that he was not behaving as if this were a farewell to two roughhearted friends . Yet there was nothing in his mind that could be uttered to them  --  nothing even that they might recall after he had run away as havingsignified his affection . He did like them , and he always would . But any kind of good-bye was impossibletonight . And would n't he be seeing them anywayin the morning ? It was a relief to put the subject off , he said , as closing time arrived and he hastened down the highway toward the dark road that would take him home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what did they know about Lucy ? The darkness of the woods  --  the same darkness in which she slept , if indeed she slept  --  brought her close about him again , and he remem/bered now with perfect clearness every syllable she had spoken at the spring . Good God , what did they know about the importance of Lucy to him ? It was not merely that he loved her as he always had . It was that he depended on her now for every tolerable breath he would ever draw . A few hours ago she had done for him what nobody else could do , and what he had been unable to do by himself . She must have worked it all out during the long afternoon ; must have prepared herself for every quick turn which their conversation would take . She had not said much . But how firmly she had guided him , and at the same time with how gentle a touch , to that strange and somber end for which her name had been happiness , and his name joy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is joy . She made me think of him , and it was of nothing else that I had been wanting through all those nights and days to think . It is of nothing else that I shall think henceforth . Not so much now , tonight , for there are other things , and I am not with Lucy . But tomorrow  --  oh , it must be as we said tomorrow . Lucy must go with inc . I am not sorry any more that I placed my harden where I did . She has given me back my portion after all , and there is a terrible rightness in our standing together under it . Beginning tomorrow , I shall think  --  Lucy and I will thinkBut he thought now of the hour when lie should leave his family behind him . He was running away from home , and if there had been a morning not so long since when the taste of it  --  of Hen particularly  --  had been acid in his mouth , it was not so any more . He found it hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many lonely souls who can not comfortone another . Not that I comfort them . But not that I do not love them , either , in our way . And not that they wo n't miss my money , such as it is . He needed money to run away with Lucy . How much he hardly dared to ask , but he could not keep from thinking about the fact . He had saved a little ; not quite forty dollars . And forty dollars would take them somewhere . But then ! And was the forty dollars his to run away with , when such a sum would do so much good here in this house he was approaching through the trees ? Nobody knew he had it . But there was no satisfaction in the thought . Indeed the thought kept entangling itself with images of Lucy and himself starving in a strange city  --  a city , perhaps , from which his old teacher had disappeared , leaving no directions by which he might be found ; or , on the other hand , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : You are a young fool , I do n't remember you . Ray saw himself turning away from the door to tell Lucy the result of his final effort ; and saw , like another picture behind this one , his mother and father deserted by all their children , creeping helplessly about the house , turning vainly to one another for the comfort they could no longer expect.  |p245His  father  --  creeping ! It would n't be even that . And he rubbed his eyes to rid them of the truer image that insisted on taking its place . He stepped at last into the kitchen , beyond which , down the short hall , he heard Julia and his mother talking , and saw the moving shadows which their hands cast on the wall opposite the room where they sat . Sewing , he said . Poor mother ! As late as this , and sewing . " Ray . " There was his father calling through the closed door of his little room . He must have been listening with a pitiful eagerness for this first footstepin the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , but why at such an hour , whenHis mother came down the hall in such haste that she passed Ray without appearing to see him . " Pa ! " she called through the door . " Was that you ? I 'd a sworn it was Ray . Hai n't he come in yet ? " " Yes , he has , but you go to sleep . " " Where is he ? Upstairs ? " " No , you heard him all right , but  --  " " Aw , I only wanted to ask him something I 'm afraid I 'll forget by morning . " " Well , you remember it . Got nothin ' else to do . " She turned to Ray and mumbled for him to be off  --  looking at him curiously all the while , her face working in a way he could not fathom.  | " Mother , " he whispered , " what are you doing up so late , sewing ? I 'm sorry you have to , and maybe you do n't really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , refusing to whisper . " Nothing for you to carry on about . You get to bed and stay there . " " Is Julia helping you ? " " She is and you ai n't . And ca n't . So good night , boy . " There was an awkward tenderness in the last word , so that Ray seized her suddenly and kissed her . " Mottle ' ! I 'm sorry you have to work so hard . " " Go on . It 's nothin ' but a nuisance . No work to it . Nothin ' to work with . " " I do n't know what that means , Mother . But , good night . " She turned away silently while he climbed the stairs to his room , where he fell asleep so soon that it seemed only a few seconds before he awoke out of a terrible dream to find the sun shining sharply in his face . He tried not to remember the dream , but he did remember it all the time he was dressing . Driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had gone against his will  --  driven , he repeated , by an extremity which was almost like a spear at his back  --  he had gone in an agony of disgust to the grave . And he had dug up the body  --  or the clothes , rather , for the body had disappeared  --  and had been about to reach into thep247pockets for the money he somehow knew was there when the flashlight dropped from a fold of the coat and blinded his eyes . The flashlight was the sun , of course . But he was not the ghoul at the grave . He said , I was n't that man , I could n't have been there . And he would have denied the dream except that he could not . P248RAY 'S MIND AS HE DRESSED WAS FILLED NOT SOmuch with the dream as with the fact that ithad occurred . On this morning , too , of all mornings ; when only a few hours lay between his going downstairs and his going at noon to hear Lucy say whether there were to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fact that there could have been a dream like this got steadily in the way of his hope , and mocked at him because he had used such a word as joy . Yet the reminder in it that he was never after all to be free of a certain thought was for the moment strangely steadying . He knew it now , and to the extent that he knew it he was not afraid ; nor would his mind veer henceforward with every passing accident of sight or sound . He had his dark light to steer by , and there was no danger of its going out . With a certain calmness , then , he paused halfway down the stairs and climbed them again to his small room under the eaves ; going to his rickety bureau and taking out the best clothes he had there , piece by piece , and making a low pile of them on the chair . Then he opened the closet he had built with his own hands and examined his one presentable suit.  |p249It  was not quite roomy enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he folded it on top of the pile . He might not be back here today  --  he might never be here again , he said quickly , whatever Lucy might have in her mind to say when he first came in sight at the spring . Whatever her doubts today , she would not resist . Yes , they were going . It had to be . So he would get these things out of the house after breakfast and take them to the camp where they could be ready for him at a moment 's notice . He descended with them under his arm , wondering where he could hide them until he had said good-bye , or what would be remembered as good-bye . Julia and his mother were sewing again . He knew it by the sound of their voices through the closed door of the room where their hands had moved in the lamplight last evening . It was beyond his understanding , their being at it again so early today ; but then it was irrelevant to his plan , and he must not concern himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word . If he had any it was to have no plan . Simply to run away with Lucy . To carry his forty dollars in his pocket  --  he tucked his clothes behind the kitchen door and started upstairs a second time . There the bills were , behind the loose board iii his closet wall , and the quarters he had never changed to paper . It would be strange , feeling them iii his work clothes all day . He must have come down more loudly this time ,  | because his mother met him at the kitchen door with a finger at her lips , whispering that he must not wake his father . " The other boys are gone off , " she said . " So if you can be quiet he 'll catch up on his rest . " But I must tell him good-bye , said Ray . " Mother , though  --  he was so set on asking me something this morning . " " I said be quiet ! " Yet she did not look as stern as she sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to get your breakfast at the camp . No time for fiddlin ' in the kitchen , and if I dropped a lid I 'd never get over bein ' mad about it . " " Mother ! " he said , and kissed her on the forehead with an attempt at casualness . " All right , but I do n't know when I 'll  --  " He hesitated . " Do n't know what ? " " Oh , nothing . Is Julia in there ? " " Yes , but Julia 's busy . " Ray decided to leave things thus . It was the way to go  --  and , strangely enough , his mother seemed to be helping him go . " Time for you to be off , " she said . " Is that your bundle behind the door ? If so , you 're ready to march . " Ray took it and marched , waving as he reached the wood road and surprised that his mother still stood at the door to be a witness to the gesture . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general way for hisp251desertion of the place . But there she had been standingwhen he turned around . Strange ; and yet no stranger than the fact that she had seen his bundle of clothes and had not been curious . But he must go on and think of other things : of Dutch and Lena , of the morning before him , of the sun at noon and of two persons standing under it , saying  --  saying what ? Before too long he must think of that . Now he must go on , remembering his dream as little as possible . There would be time for remembering it . And meanwhilehe wished he had seen his father , if only in his sleep . He had left home the right way , quickly and quietly . He wished , though , that he had seen his father . Lena let him cook his breakfast over the gas plate while she stood guard at the counter  --  or so it seemed to Ray , who fancied that she was in a protective mood this morning . She was protecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might come in and say . It could hardly be that , of course . And yet Dutch was keeping to himself somewhere , as if he had had his orders . Well , this was as good a time as any to drop a word . " Have you ever thought , Lena , that I would n't always be here with you and Dutch ? " " Nope , I never did . " " You can realize , though , that I probably wo n't . " " Nope , I ca n't . I figure on your hero ' here with white hair in the next century . People 'll come for a thousand miles to see the old grass cutter and bed maker . I 've left you a pair of silver shears in my will , to go with your silver hair , and a little mahogany stool to stand on when you smooth the spreads . " He would n't get far in this direction . Lena was ready for him , as if she stood on guard against him too . So he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rounds for the last time . For the last time . Was he sure of that ? He looked down at Number 2o , where he had hidden his bundle under the bed . That was before he had gone in to get his breakfast ; and it had not been easy . But it was the best cabin for the purpose , since he could slip from it this afternoon or tonight with the least chance of being seen , and since nobody ever went into it now . Innocent people did not go into it , he said . WhereasHe went doggedly about his business , refusing to think again of Number 20 until it should be noon . Then it was noon ; and he must walk past the cabin , turn the corner , and descend to where Lucy was waiting for him , ready to  --  But it was not easy to walk past it calmly , for he realized all at once that there had been a connection in his mind between the clothes under that bed and the clothes  --  not his at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  in anotherplace not very far away . A place where someone had gone last night to find them , to tumble them , to take from them  --  It had been a dream , he an/swered . Only a dream . But there had been a dream . It had been possible to see this thing happening . And now tonight , or this afternoon , when he reached his hand under the bedWhen he failed to find Lucy at the spring he ran desperately along the path that should have brought her there ; and all but trampled her where she stood staring at him behind the last of the big stones . " Ray ! " Her eyes were wide and colorless . " I was spying on you . I wanted to see you before you saw me . But that was wrong . Ray ! What is it ! Tell me ! " He held himself away from her , trying to tell his dream coldly . But the words came more and more quickly , and in the end he could not tell it all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . " " Yes , " she said , coming quickly to him and reaching for his hands . " I see . But did n't you know it might happen ? Especially  --  especially if  --  " " What , darling ? " " If you did n't think of him ? By daylight ? " " But I did . At least I  --  " " At least you said to yourself : I will . Sometime . " He lifted her face from where she had hidden it against him , pressing herself there as if she must never leave him again . " How did you guess ? " " No matter . And this was no time to say it . There is n't much time , Ray . Louise and Connie are up there  --  they came to see me , I do n't know why  --  and I must get back . I did n't want them after all . I hoped to be alone all morning , and then to be with you longer than this . They 're talking to Aunt Esther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yes . " " We 're going . " He had never doubted it , he thought , yet the convulsion of relief which threatened to seize him seemed to mean that he had . He tried to lift her face again , and could not . " I had a dream too , " she said . He faltered before insisting that she tell it . " Now , " he whispered . " No . There is n't time . There will be time , though , and I promise . After a while , Ray , we wo n't have them any more , if  --  " " If we think ? " " Yes , and talk . And hold each other this way . " Suddenly it was possible for him to laugh . " But if we hold each other this way you ca n't get back to Connie and Louise . " She stepped back from him and smiled through the tears he had not seen till now . " They are so nice to me , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't keep my mind on what they say . It 's almost gruesome . But when you come at nine  --  " " At nine ? " Then she had decided . " Yes . Have you thought  --  " " Only that I know how to stop the midnight bus at headquarters . Dutch and Lena will be asleep , andp255even if they are n't  --  But I have n't been able to think of what we can do between nine and twelve . " " It must be nine , though . Aunt Esther does n't sleep after midnight . If she is n't in bed she 'll be reading , and she never notices anything then . I 'll be out at the gate . Do you understand ? " " Of course . The three hours are nothing . We 'll  --  " " Good-bye , dear . Good-bye till then . " He watched her go swiftly away from him , and her firmness in refusing to look back gave him the firmnessto say over and over in his mind the line that had lodged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible dreams that shake us nightly . These terrible dreams that shake us nightly . But if we tell them all they wo n't be terrible . And after a while they wo n't come nightly . Or shake us . Not if we hold each other and remember . These terrible dreams that shake us nightly . These terrible dreams that shake us nightly.  | THAT SHAKE US NIGHTLY . BUT NOT if HE THOUGHT of Delano by daylight . There was a dark star for him to steer by in broad daylight , a fixed and steadying star ; and all he needed was to keep his eyes on it , he said to himself as he returned for his last afternoon at the camp . And it was thus that the afternoon passed . For Delanowas with him wherever he walked or stood ; not upright any more , not waiting there on his feet with his white hands hanging at his side , but laid straightly in his grave , horizontal forever , his head no longer bent upon his shoulders , the flashlight gone out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this morning 's calmness , at the same time that he kept on repeating to himself : I know now what I have done . It is something the consequences of which I must never expect to escape . I have killed a man . Because of me this man is no longer erect in the sunshine , standing there for other people to look at . I have laid him down , I have laid him down out of everybody 's sight except mine ; and Lucy 's ; and since he can not stand again it is our task to keep him from trying , to keep his peace for him . I am not thinking of our peace . Of his . He did notp257seek this peace , and I gave it to him for no reason . But I did give it to him ; and if I made the terrible mistake of hiding what I had done  --  even the next day it was too late  --  it would be a greater mistake now to shatter the silence in which he sleeps . And in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our minds  --  a sleeping man , a man for whose peace we are responsible . Once it crossed Ray 's mind that suspicion might settle upon him after he had disappeared , and the thin smile of Donaldson hung in front of him for a moment like a threat . But then he remembered that he had never strictly been under suspicion ; and the fear was answered at last by certain words of Lena 's which spoke themselves in his ear . We know about Lucy . Yes , they all knew about Lucy . That would be enough for them to talk about and think about , day in and day out for weeks and months . And yet they knew nothing about Lucy . He knew so much ; and now so entirely , so tenderly loved her as he thought forward across the diminishing stretch of time until it should be nine o'clock . It was she who had quieted the world for him and brought it into order ; or into all the order he deserved . The most he could possibly deserve was this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrest which would last  --  oh , it might last forever , leaving him to be sure but half alive , a man merely not rest- less , a mind merely not tortured . There had been a time when he expected more from the world . But he was lucky to have this much , to be going away from Windless like this , so utterly unnoticed . It was almost as if Windless did not care what he had done . It was tolerating his departure , it was turning its head while he and Lucy slipped out in the darkness . And perhaps it was exacting its penalty after all by ignoring them thus . It was letting them die away from it into the silence of which their thoughts henceforward would be composed . Ray until now had been unable to imagine himself in any other place with Lucy . Nor did he see the place now ; he only saw them in a deep silence , watching each other 's thoughts , passing nights and days perhaps without a single word as they waited in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be no more of these terrible dreams . He shook himself . It was time to go and dress in the half-darkness of Number 20 , and to see whether there was anything under the bed besides his clothes . To take off these he had on and fold them neatly for Dutch to find whenever Dutch should pick up the courage to enter a cabin which was not for innocent men to enter . He entered it and went straight to the bed , on which a beam from the arc light fell through the drawn curtains , casting black shadows underneathp259into which Ray hesitated only an instant to plunge his hand . Nothing was there to feel or see besides his clothes . But he gasped as he realized it , and undressed and dressed with a haste which told him that his nerves were no longer as steady as they had been . For the only way for him to go where he was going now was by the path to the spring and thence by the gravel road , and all at once he was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he would have to come in turn to the spring , to the overflow , to the crotched maple , and to the place in the gravel where on a certain night no darker than this oneHe came forth from the cabin resolutely . He must go at once , for the time had arrived . He must stop this devil of his thought ; stop it by the very regularityof his pace , now that he had started down the path . The scheme appeared to be working ; for Ray , deviating at no moment from the pace he set his feet , and saying Lucy 's name to himself as if it were a charm against the darkness , advanced past each of the points he had enumerated without . so much as a flick of his head or a leap of his nerve . The only thing he noticed was that in his imagination he walked faster and faster past each critical turn ; not actually faster , for he could test himself there , but by some illusion so . It was as if two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , ran races in him toward his goal.  | And it was hard , this containing two kinds of time , one of which pulled him so much faster than he went , and both of which kept up a war within him which no man could stand forever . But then he became aware that he had only one more turn to make before he would be in sight of Lucy 's house  --  in sight of it , that is , were this not so dark a night . And suddenly the fast time won , for now he was running with all his strength  --  actually running , for it was more than his heart that he heard  --  in order to put the last turn behind him and be within sight , possibly , of Lucy 's dim figure at the gate . One of the windows might be lighted , and whatever light there was would show as much of her as he needed to see . The fact that all the windows were lighted did not present itself as a fact during the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it in  --  or take in the sound of music , which came to him like something mad , along with the sound of many voices which seemed at a great distance to be caressing one another , and growing under the caress . These dimmerlights outside , too , ranged before the fence  --  why , they were cars , he said , or the metalwork of cars , shining in the light that poured forward from the windows . Cars ! " Is that you , Ray ? " When he could not answer she ran down the road to meet him , flying into his arms and clinging therep261as she said slowly and painfully , a queer sort of difficultyworking in her voice : " They let me come out alone to meet you . They promised to wait inside till I brought you  --  " " They ! They ! Lucy , who are they ? I ca n't  --  " " Oh , Ray , and I ca n't either . I ca n't stand it , the thought of so much  --  of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Esther and Louise and Connie are giving us a party ! " And she let him have all her weight , hystericallygrateful to him for being there at last . " Aunt Esther ? " Ray groped in his mind for the question . " Did she know ? " " That we were running away ? Of course not . She thought we had quarreled ; and thought we had made it up ; and thought  --  Oh , I do n't know what else she thought . " But the question in Ray 's mind had not been this one . It had been : Can I endure it , can Lucy and I endure it ? She seemed to understand what he had not spoken , for she said at last , raising her hands to his face : " Ray . I said I could n't stand it . So much noise and so much laughing when  --  when  --  " " I know , dear , " said Ray . " When all we wanted to do was die away . " " Yes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It will be awful to go back there . But we must . Do you see ? " " I was thinking  --  "  | " You may have been thinking we could die away this instant . I know . But we ca n't do that . We must go in and pretend , a little while at any rate . It can be done . We 've done harder things . And we 've got harder things to do . I never thought , though  --  " Her hands were hot as they seized his , and her eyes shone in the light which came down the path to meet them . She was trembling all over ; and not , he said , with misery merely.  |p263AS  SHE OPENED THE FRONT DOOR AND PULLED HIMin behind her an innumerable throng seemedsuddenly to move from all the rooms of the blazing house into the hall where they stood . Blinded by the brilliance to which she had returned , Lucy stood motionless , staring as if into darkness  --  or into the waters of the spring which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and long ago . The people opposite her were for a suspended moment one great person , one pool which reflected her gaze . And the reflection was something from which she did not shrink . She had never shrunk from the face of the spring , down there among the big rocks . It had been her friend when as a little girl she ran to it from her father 's rages ; when she had grown older , too , and of course when she had sought it for comfort because Ray  --  because RayShe refused to think further , aware as she now was that the spring was here before her , and that she was staring into it without fright . A pool of laces  --  one great face  --  and she was not afraid . She was not afraid of people . Then she heard them . " Hello , Ray . . . . Hello , Ray . . . . Well , well.  | . . . Hello , Ray . . . . How are you , pardner ? . . . Surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing here ? . . . Who 's this ? Hello , Ray . . . . Hello , stranger . Hello , Ray . . . . Look who Lucy dragged in . . . Hello , Ray . . . . " The voices and faces swam in a strong tide toward them both , and they could distinguish no one for a moment . Then Lucy , clearing her vision with the greatest difficulty , reached for a pair of hands and drew someone to Ray . " Here 's Connie , " she cried up to him without daring to lift her face ; but he could hear the effort in her voice , and he knew that she would be aware of all that he thought or felt while the evening lasted . " Now we know what she was up to . " Lucy could scarcely make herself heard , nor did Connie attempt anything better than a wide smile and a thrown kiss as she ducked out of sight again . But someone had been identified , and now , stunned though he still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gaped at Joe Palmer , the Atwill boys , Louise with the red of her cheeks deepened almost to purple , May Batesonwith her cheeks pale from the excitement , and  --  yes , peeking over the crowd at him , Julia in what must be the dress she had been sewing on last night . He made the first move he had made since the party broke over him . " Julia ! " he shouted , plowing through to her and fingering the ruffle at her shoulder . " Is Mother here ? "  |p265I  must follow him , thought Lucy . So now she said in his ear : " Come . I 'll show you . " He looked at her , conscious now for the first time that if this was misery in her face it was  --  No , it was not misery , he said . Poor Lucy ! To think that when this should have happened to her it should have happened thus . For in spite of everything there was a suppressed and burning excitement in the face that now looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never seen before . It was a party . Her party . And the pity of the loneliness they had planned to feel mingled with his perception now of the irony which fate had built into their last night at Windless ; mingledwith this , he realized , and with a certain complexand uncontrollable emotion , deeper than tears or laughter , which made him suddenly desire that these people should stay here like this forever , arrestedin their gaiety , poised on the brink of an eternal dance that Lucy might keep always with her like a trinket from the past . " Here 's Hen , " she was saying . " He can come too , with Julia and us . " Hen came forward , awkward in his suit , and shook hands a little too hard , the novelty of his good nature proving all at once a fearful strain upon him . " Sure , " he said . " We brought Ma . Fritz and Roger 's here  --  somewheres , I do n't know where . " Across the room from Ray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their chairs without a thought of the hubbub around them . They were only pretending , however , for they rose as soon as they were approached , and Mrs. Slode met his kiss with a ready cheek . A tired one , though , thought Ray . Poor Mother ! And I know that dress . " Bandit ! " Aunt Esther had not waited for him to greet her . " The house is open to you . Take anything you want . Even my most precious possession . If you want it . Do you ? " But it is my house , thought Lucy . Mine and my father 's  --  his , really . And now Aunt Esther is giving it away along with her most precious possession . She means me by that . She means me . Her possession . Yes , I have been her possession . And so has the house . It was hers from the very day she entered it and darkened it . It was not my father 's any more , or mine . And I am glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gladThen she remembered that Aunt Esther was waiting for Ray to speak . She squeezed his arm . " The party was her idea . Not Connie 's , not Louise 's . She wrote all the letters , she ordered all the things , she  --  " " You 're distracting him , child . I asked him a question . Do you , bandit ? " Ray looked at her steadily . " I do . " " That 's answering . But as to the party , child  --  " turning to Lucy  --  " do n't be grateful . When I make up my mind to lose a thing I go the whole way . Forp267instance , at ten-thirty I shall be in my room upstairs , and I shall expect both of you there . Will you keep me waiting ? " The deep voice carried a sudden threat in it , and Lucy wondered if the old Aunt Esther had departed after all . A moment ago there had been nothing of her to see or hear . " My most precious possession "  --  meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , it was " Will you keep me waiting ? " In the sternest of voices , and with the blackest frown . Lucy trembled at the thought that fear was returning to the room . But almost at once she believed she detecteda grim smile fighting its way to the corner of that mouth . And she understood , or hoped she understood , how often Aunt Esther had concealed a certainkindness behind the terrors of her tongue . A certainkindness , and a certain fun . She never wanted to frighten me , Lucy said  --  and sighed , for reassurance had come so late . If it had come . She looked at Ray , needing his help as she answered : " No , Aunt Esther . We 'll be prompt . " " Good . And meanwhile , children , the party languishesfor lack of you . Have the music . Talk , sing , dance , anything . Try the cake and coffee in the dining room . But do n't forget . Ten-thirty ! " Lucy caught sight of Dutch and Lena behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I could n't trust Dutch not to blab about this today , so I sat on him , " said Lena , gorgeous in her flaring yellow dress . " I could a done it , " said Dutch . But his grin seemed to say he was n't sure . " Well , boy , it 's good to see you here like this . Proud of you . I was sayin ' to Lena on the way over  --  " " Come on , come on , " said Lena . " Ray ca n't talk to us all night . " The music started , and Lucy knew that Ray , watching the couples through the wide door between him and the parlor , wished suddenly that he could dance . Fritz and Roger could . She saw them seize their partners  --  tall girls , almost as tall as themselves  --  and go shoving off , condescending to wink at him  --  their first greeting of the night  --  as they passed the door . " Let 's talk to somebody , " said Lucy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I thought I 'd be talking to you by this time , darling . You alone . " " Are you sorry now ? I made you come in when you did n't  --  " " No , Lucy , I 'm not sorry . I wish I could say what I am . I think it 's glad . " She looked at him with bright , quick tears in her eyes . " It 's good for lovers once in their lives not to be alone . " " Poor Lucy ! " But I am not poor Lucy , she sang to herself . I'mp269not poor Lucy . Twice I have thought of my father without sorrow , and I have heard something in Aunt Esther 's voice that was always there . I could n't hear it , but it was there . Now it is clear and strong . And now I can forget my father  --  I mean , forget that he was afraid too . Of my fear . I 'm not poor Lucy . She smiled at Ray and shook her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell us if it 's in her room . You know , I 've hardly ever been there . " Louise 's mother came up , and Lucy was at once aware that Ray disliked her because she made so much of this " very , very queer party " in a house , she said , " that has been darker than the grave ever since Louise graduated . " But others swept by after her , and the music stopped only to start again ; while certainof the guests already prowled in the dining room after cake and coffee . Aunt Esther had long ago left Mrs. Slode to the care of Mrs. Owens , who sat by her and nodded dutifullyin spite of the fact that Mrs. Slode , keeping her eyes always on Ray , said nothing to anybody . " It 's ten-thirty , " said Lucy . " Then  --  " " Let 's hurry . She wo n't like it if we 're a minute late . " They stopped before Aunt Esther 's door , and Lucy knocked . The sound chilled her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , and the silence  --  for there was no answer from within  --  reminded her of the evening she had tried to make him understand that there was nothing to forgive him for . She had pressed her lips to the keyhole and cried in to him that he must listen . But no answer . It was a silence just like this , and it lastedBut this one did not last . The deep voice sounded . " Come in ! " Lucy , recovering and entering first , whirled to look anxiously at Ray , a new excitement whitening her cheeks . " It 's Mr. Leonard , " she whispered . " Come in , " said Aunt Esther , " both of you . Do n't stand there whispering . You know Mr. Leonard , and he knows you . He has come here to marry you if that is what you want . If it is . Is it ? " In the utter silence Mr. Leonard rose from behind the walnut desk and smiled at them . " This is not regular , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked them a question , " said Aunt Esther , " and I need the answer . " Ray , whose heart Lucy could feel beating with a terrible violence , refrained from looking at her as he said : " It is what I want , Aunt Esther . " " And you , child ? " " And I. " But she made almost no sound in the silent room . " Well , then , I have the license , or rather Mr. Leonard has it . That was irregular too , but it is here.  |p271And  there are witnesses "  --  the door creaked as Louise and Connie tiptoed into the room , their faces grave under Aunt Esther 's gaze  --  " there are witnesses . " Mr. Leonard cleared his throat before he began , but for Ray and Lucy , standing where Aunt Esther had pulled them , it was as if he had never done so , since the words ran into a mumble and their own ears rang with soft , incomprehensible sounds. " . . . man and wife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear , and looked down to see Lucy imploring him for a sign that he had heard them . Her face was paler than before  --  with amazement , he said , and joy ; and even with terror . He smiled only for her , bending to her and kissing her , and holding his arms about her so long that Aunt Esther called out : " Enough for now . Mr. Leonard , thank you . You are free to go . And Louise and Connie  --  " " Oh , Lucy , " sighed Louise through her tears . " I thought I would be the first . " " You were n't , " said Aunt Esther , " nor will you be the last . I suggest that you see me downstairs after a few minutes . There are some things I need to say to these young people . " As the door closed she grew if anything more expressionlessthan she had been . " Now . Was it what you wanted ? " Neither of them looked up at her.  | " Good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The party is over for you . " Lucy stood off from Ray and stared . " The party  --  " " Of course . You wo n't want to appear down there again . Brides and grooms skip out . In this case down the back stairs . Your brother Hen will meet you outside the kitchen door and show you to your car . " Now Ray was staring . " Do n't look at me like that . Either of you . It is n't intelligent . You have a car . Hen  --  the ruffian  --  tells me I did n't do especially well , but he assures me it will run . A Ford . You can skip in it . Of course you will need money . Have you any ? " The strain under which she spoke was showing in the shortness of her sentences , which snapped from her now like sparks . " I thought so , " she went on , though Ray had not answered her . " In this envelope "  --  turning stiffly to the desk  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last poor people a long while . I am poor and it has lasted me since my husband died . I saved it , Lucy  --  now be intelligent  --  for some such purpose as this . For just this purpose , in fact , as soon as I knew I was coming to live with you . There are three hundred more , but I am keeping those in the bank till you send for them . You will need them , though not at once . I  --  " Something had stopped her , or else she was merely through . But now it was possible for Lucy to run top273her and say between uncontrollable sobs : " Aunt Esther ! If you had only let me tell you before . I love you , Aunt Esther . More than anyone except Ray . Ray  --  why have you never kissed Aunt Esther ? Come here . " Ray roused himself with a struggle out of the stupor into which he had fallen ; and came , watching as he did so the cold features on which there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and Lucy saw that he was startled as he did so . " Aunt Esther , " he said . " You do not know how good a woman you are . You do not know  --  " " Good to you , " she said . " That is n't good . I am not a good woman . " " Better than you know , " said Ray . He could only repeat himself , though he was aware how stupid he must sound . " No ! " She was herself again . " But Hen grows rude if he 's kept waiting . Good night . I wo n't say goodbye . " She moved toward the door while she talked , saying as she opened it for the sound of music and many voices to come in : " You 'll be back someday to see me . I 'll be here . It 's your house , Lucy . " The door closed abruptly as Lucy ran gasping across the room for some last word . Then she stopped , convinced , and waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait now  --  she could wait for anything.  | For she loved Aunt Esther and had told her she was afraid of nothing .

" " Because she did n't know what she was doing ? " " No . Because we are leaving her . " She smiled a she drew his face down for a kiss . " You shouldn ' have told her there was something she did n't know She 's proud . " " But , Lucy ! " And Ray dropped his hands hell lessly . " Think of all she did n't know . " " Not now .

" Her voice , faint in the dusk , seemed to promise him that she would not change . But it told him also how perilous a burden had gone with her , and the weight of this , adding itself all at once to his own , made him sit down for strength until he could climb the hill again to Windless Cabins.  | THE EVENING AT HEADQUARTERS PROLONGED ITselfuntil it seemed to Ray an insuperable obstacleblocking his way to the time when he should he alone again and free to think .

Had it exhausted him so that his mind lived on in a daze thenceforward , unable to keep itself to the track of its duty ? Was that why he had committed the sin of which Lucy seemed an hour ago to be convicting him : the sin of self-thought , the sin of denying his sorrow for someone other than himself ?
