All summer long the Japanese naval high command , reshuffled after the smashing defeat in the First Battle of the Philippine Sea , had planned for the next inevitable meeting with the U.S. Fleet . The blow must be struck when the U.S. amphibious forces entered the last island defense line , **34;2475;TOOLONG . So for the three top-ranking taisho* there was not a wide choice of time . But the taisho could still pick the specific moment : it would be in the first confused days of the beachhead . They devised an ingenious Japanese plan , last week snapped it into execution , after the Americans ' surprise landing on Leyte . <P> Result : a disastrous defeat from which the Empire 's once proud navy would never completely recover . <P> When the battle ended : <P> Twenty-four Jap warships were on the bottom : two battleships , four carriers , nine cruisers , three flotilla leaders and six destroyers . <P> Possibly sunk were a battleship , five cruisers and seven destroyers . <P> Damaged when they left the Philippine Sea were six battleships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warships sent into action , only two escaped without hurt : the 34 that limped home , broken and smoking , would clog their repair yards for months while U.S. planes hammered at them to put them out of business for keeps . <P> Born of Necessity . While they were waiting to see where the U.S. blow on the island defenses would fall , the Japs had dispersed their fleet , at stations from the home islands to Singapore . When General MacArthur 's men stormed ashore on Leyte with four assault divisions , the admirals set their prefabricated plans in operation . <P> They had lost the initiative long ago ; now to get at Leyte Gulf and its cluster of soft-shelled U.S. transports , their war ships must pass through narrow waters . <P> Nothing south of the Philippines would do for the attack : Lieut . General Kenney 's airmen based on Morotai had closed those routes . There were only two channels through the Philippines . The Japs bent their strategy to geographic necessity . <P> Their central thrust , with a force built around five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike Vice Admiral Thomas Cassin Kinkaid 's Seventh Fleet , guarding the Leyte beach head , on its northern flank . <P> Although black-browed Tom Kinkaid had received divisions of escort carriers and at least five battleships to fill out the contours of his normally skinny fleet , the Japs knew he would be hard pressed to stave off this assault . To make doubly sure , their southernmost force would charge through Surigao Strait . Either or both of these forces would strive for a chance to pot sitting ducks - the helpless transports off Leyte . <P> Their third , northernmost force , which included four of their precious , dwindling stock of flattops , would send off planes to smear Admiral Mitscher 's bare-decked carriers when the latters planes were far away , giving Kinkaid support which the Japs ' were confident he would need and demand . <P> Oversight . On paper it was a fine complex plan . There were only two things against it : one was that Old Stagers Halsey , Mitscher and Kinkaid were comb ing the seas with planes and submarines looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. force .
