THE GUN ON THE TABLE A Story JOHN WATSON T T stx o'clock on a summer evening , when the sun 's rays are lengthen- ing through the mesquite bushes , you might see a lone horseman jogging along over the red clay road . You might see two , Elmer Doolittle was thinking  --  but never six . After the three-mile ride from the store , he was still wondering why he and the other five men were here . Why the minister ? Why the justice of the peace ? The horses had been moving along unhurriedly , following the pace set by the old man in the lead . Bart Roberts was as slow and deliberate as time itself in this secluded section of rural Texas . At the rate they had traveled those three miles , Elmer was thinking , it would be after sundown when they got there . Then , to his surprise , they turned in at the next gate and stopped . " I 'll get it , " said the old man , as if some of the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they had n't . They were sitting in their saddles like statues . It was the first word spoken since they had left the store . Elmer still did n't know what it was all about . Had the old man committed a murder , that he was bringing a justice of the peace and a minister ? But why the others ? Why were they turning in at Willie Turner 's gate instead of going on down a mile further to the Roberts place ? Why here ? Bart Roberts dismounted and lifted the gate , standing with the chain in his hand while the minister passed through , then Uncle Jimmy and the others . Elmer watched him as he closed the gate behind him . He moved as if he were dead tired , his eyes sunken back in their sockets and half closed from lack of sleep . Had this old man , whom every farmer in the Bend thought of as a living example of goodness itself , committed a crime at the very tag-end of his life ? There was nothing about the faded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the tanned , leathery face covered by a week 's growth of scraggly gray beard . Elmer did not know , but there was that about the eyes , the expressionless stare , the silence , that kept him from asking . Why here ? The old man swung back up into the saddle , slow and laboriously . The others waited for him to take the lead again , heading first for Willie Turner 's little three-room house , then bearing off to the right toward the giant live oak tree . Elmer watched the others to see if the tree meant anything to them . Uncle Jimmy Hancock , older even than old man Roberts , seemed neither to know nor to wonder what game was being played . If Flem and Dave  --  both tenant farmers and neighbors of Willie Turner  --  knew anything , the expression on their faces did not reveal it . But the minister knew something . Bart Roberts checked his horse into a slow walk and stopped when he reached the first branches of the live oak . Without turning his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battered old gray hat and rested it on the horn of his saddle , waiting for the others to come up and stop . " There , " he said , pointing in under the tree . " The setting sun 's in your eyes , so you ca n't hardly see it . " Elmer Doolittle urged his horse forward a step and peered in under the branches of the tree . " Why , it 's a grave , " he said , taking off his hat . " Looks like a small grave . " The old man was running his fingers through his white hair , a vacant , faraway stare in his eyes . " Yes , " he said . " It 's just a little feller . " " Somebody die ? " said Elmer . " Willie Turner 's wife have a baby ? " He thought Bart Roberts was ready to talk now , ready to tell what he had brought them out here to tell . " Wait , " said the old man . Then , turning away , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clump of cedars he dismounted , threw the reins over a limb and tied them , then went on up the steps . As Elmer entered the fireplace room , Bart Roberts 's wife opened the door on the other side of the room and looked in . Old man Roberts merely nodded , as if giving her some prearranged signal , and she disappeared and closed the door , leaving the five guests standing awkwardly waiting for an invitation to sit down or to go into the back part of the house to see what might be there . T HE old man looked around the room slowly , inspecting the furniture . Then , apparently satisfied , he began seating them . " You take that easy rocker over there , Uncle Jimmy . Elmer , the split bottom chair . Dave , this here one 'll do for you . " And so on . He seated four of them , leaving himself and the minister standing . Then he sat down in the only other chair in the room . No one offered to get up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was making the arrangements . If he wanted the preacher to stand , it was all right with them . Elmer stretched his left foot out along the floor in front of him , reaching deep into his side pocket . He brought out a bone-handled knife and a plug of tobacco . Cutting himself a chew , he passed the plugand the knife , with the little blade open , to Dave Groom . While they were making the rounds , the minister had backed over in front of the fireplace . He stood with his hands behind him as if warming them , but there was no fire in the fireplace . Beads of perspiration stood out on his forehead . Elmer could tell that the monkey was on the minister 's back . He was the only one of the invited guests who seemed to be in the least concerned about what was going to happen . Uncle Jimmy had settled himself down in the rocker , apparently prepared to sit out the night in silence . Dave Groom had worked his chew of tobacco around into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own pocket knife , and was paring his nails unhurriedly . Flem Mole was carefully and methodically picking his tobacco-stained teeth with a goose quill . At last the minister could stand it no longer . He could see that no one was going to say anything  --  that they were all willing to sit there until dark , until midnight , daybreak even . He took out his watch and looked at it , leaning toward the window to catch the failing light . " Mr. Roberts , " he said , " my wife will be waiting supper . " He replaced the watch nervously and buttoned his black coat . Then , wiping the perspiration from his bald head , he unbuttoned the coat again . For a full minute the old man looked at him as if he were a picture that he had seen a thousand times , staring not at him but at some point beyond him , beyond the wall even . Or maybe he was not looking at all , but listening  --  waiting for the next call of the whippoorwill out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come over here to Willie 's house , " he said , " because he has got a bit of a story to tell and I was n't just sure and certain what ought to be done about it , or whether anything ought to be done about it . " So it was the preacher , Elmer was thinking , as all eyes turned upon the man in black standing before the fireplace . The minister straightened up , adjusted his thick-lensed glasses , and opened his mouth to speak . But the old man stopped him . " Wait , " he said . " I brought Dave and Flem along because they 're deacons in his church , and I thought maybe they 'd be interested in hearing what he has got to say for hisself . " Dave Groom left off paring his nails and looked up at the minister . " You in trouble , Brother Skagmire ? " he said , unemotionally . The inflection  --  or lack of inflection ? indicated that no answer was expected . " I asked Uncle Jimmy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . And because he is a God-fearin ' man , and he knows what Godamighty put in the Good Book and what He meant by it when He put it there . " Sho now , Elmer was thinking . Two deacons and a God-fearin ' man and a minister . But why me ? Why am I here ? " I wanted Elmer , because he is not a preacher nor a deacon , nor even a church member . Because he is long on judgment and short on Jesus . Maybe the whole business will look different to him . " The old man paused , not as if he were uncertain what to say next , but as if he had said all he had intended to say for a while . The room was again filled with the silence of the tomb , broken now and then by a clicking , sucking sound as Flem Mole picked his teeth . At regular intervals Dave Groom raked his knife blade across a chapped fingernail with a dry , rasping , almost imperceptible sound . Uncle Jimmy Hancock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall over by the door . Suddenly the Reverend Mr. Skagmire broke the silence . " Mr. Roberts , " he said in a voice too loud for the tiny crowded room . " Mr. Roberts , my wife ? " The old man looked at the minister as if he had spoken out of turn at a funeral . " Have you no respect for the dead ? " he said rhetorically . Everyone in the room had looked up at the minister when he first broke the silence . They do n't know what game the old man 's playing , Elmer was thinking . They 're just waiting for him to deal them a hand . Would n't a person be in a comfortable position on trial for murder facing twelve men like them three ? He 'd sho God sweat a bucket of blood just waitin ' for them to get interested enough to want to hear the evidence . " I 'm sorry , " said the minister , half apologetic , half angry . He had lowered hisvoice to little above a whisper . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting on my nerves . I know ? " He paused , groping for a word and looking from one to the other of the five men seated before him . As he looked at each in turn he found no sympathy , no accusation , not even any interest in what it was he had started to say . He met only the cold , passionless stare of the silent men who seemed somehow to have accepted the fact that they would hear the evidence when the proper time came and pass judgment on him . What evidence ? Elmer wondered . Judgment for what ? What possible connection could there be between the preacher and the grave out there under the live oak tree ? Why was the house as silent as a tomb ? Why the sickening smell of death ? F LEM MOLE removed the goose quill from his mouth . " What was it , Pahson ? " he said in a hushed , dry voice . " What was it that was gittin ' on your nerves ? You was just about to say you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time . " Mr. Roberts ? " he said , " Mr. Roberts blames me for it . I know he does . He never said so . He never said a word to me . He just stared at me with those cold eyes that look through you . Like a man might stare at you before he reaches out and chokes the life out of you without even losing his temper . " Sho now , Elmer was thinking . It must be pretty serious . Nobody ever knowed old man Bart Roberts to look at a person like he had a mind to kill him . He 's so chicken-livered he would n't even choke a suck-egg dog . " It was n't me that did it , " said the minister . " It was the wrath of God . They 've been living in sin , and God has had their punishment laid up for them a long time back . " Mr. Roberts turned to Uncle Jimmy Hancock . " You ever know anything agin Willie Turner ? " " No , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're as fine a family of folks as ever set foot in Chaparral County . I 'd swap my chances with ary a one of them at the Pearly Gates . " The old man glanced around the room at Elmer Doolittle and Dave Groom and Flem Mole . " Any you folks know anything agin Willie Turner ? " The three men shook their heads , looking not at Mr. Roberts but at the Reverend Mr. Skagmire , who appeared to be waiting for an opening to speak again in what he obviously considered his own defense , although he had not been accused of anything . Mr. Roberts turned back to Uncle jimmy again . " You recollect Sarah Bellamy ? " " Knowed her all her life , " said Uncle Jimmy . " Married Willie Turner , " said the old man , " well as I recollect " " That 's right . She 's his second wife . Willie 's other woman run off to Californy , must of been eight or ten years ago now . " " Sarah Turner was a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bellamy that was . " " Yes . Folks around in the Bend thinks a heap of Sally . " " Her folks too . Fifty , sixty years back . " " That 's right , " said Uncle Jimmy . " Puts me in mind of the time George Bellamy come down to the May Fest and beat Charlie Turner in the tunament ride . Must of been in ' 89 . Maybe it was the next year . I disremember which . " He paused with his eyes half-closed , thinking back over his seventy-odd years in the Bend . " I recollect the time . " " I never dreamed it then , " said Uncle Jimmy , " that I 'd some day be hitchin ' up their two young ' uns in double harness . " Elmer was watching the two old men now . They 're reliving the good old days in the Bend , he was thinking , before the missionaries come sneakin ' in . A SILENCE had fallen upon the room again . The knife blade rasping on the chapped fingernail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the musty walls . The sibilant , sucking sound of the goose , nuill continued , quiet as a half-grown kitten washing its face before the fire . The Reverend Mr. Skagmire glanced at the two deacons . They were still looking at him , still staring with those glassy , expressionless , unbatting eyes of the dead . He was about to speak when the clicking , sucking noise ceased . Elmer shifted his eyes from the minister to Flem Mole . " What was it you knowed ? " said Flem . " I have n't done anything to be ashamed of , " said the minister . " I was carrying out God 's commandments . " " Sho , " said Flem Mole . " Sho you was . What might it be that Godamighty commanded you to do ? " " It 's in the Bible , " said the minister , " plain as the nose on your face . " Out of the corner of his eye Elmer saw old man Roberts shift in his seat . He saw him loosen his belt  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced his hand over the bulge , Elmer realized what he was covering up . Glancing back at the minister , he wondered if he knew that old man Roberts ' hand was lying on that six-shooter stuck under the belt  --  under the shirt  --  most likely under the long-handled drawers , next to the bare skin . " I warned them , " said the minister . " First time I set eyes on them . That was last summer , two or three days after I moved into the community . " Elmer was watching Uncle Jimmy now . Uncle Jimmy was looking at old man Roberts . Yes , Elmer was thinking , he knows the six-shooter is there . He has known it ever since the old man walked into his store with the preacher and asked him and me and the deacons to saddle up the horses . " I did n't know them from Adam and Eve , " said the minister . " They just drove up to my house in the wagon and got out and hollered hello . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had failed so gradually that Elmer could still see the man in black standing before the fireplace . " I already had the Bible out to marry them . I could n't help it if the question embarrassed them . Mr. Turner should have come over by himself first and made the arrangements . Like it was , I had to ask him in her presence . " " Sho , " said Flem Mole . " Sho you did . What question was that ? " " I asked if either one of them had ever been married before , " said the minister , unabashed . " I always ask the question . I feel like the authority to join a man and woman in holy wedlock is a God-given privilege , and I never abuse it . " So that 's it , Elmer was thinking . He would n't perform the ceremony because Willie had been divorced by this other woman out in California or wherever it was . " I could n't help it , " said the minister , " that they claimed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workings of the devil . So I asked them to sit down and I explained it all to them . I wanted her to know what she was getting into . She turned white as a sheet . They both did . I meant for them to . " So that 's it , Elmer was thinking . That 's why she was crying when they came in the store that same day and got Uncle Jimmy Hancock to marry them . Some folks says a woman cries at her weddin ' because she 's so happy . But Sally did n't look any too happy that day . And they was both in church the next Sunday when he preached the sermon on adultery . When he talked about the sins of the parents payin ' a visit in the next generation . So that 's it . So that 's the grave out there under flame light up the old man 's face . He watched him get up and walk slowly over to the mantel , cupping his hands to keep the match from going out . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked back and sat down . " But today , " he said . " Tell them about today . " This is it , Elmer was thinking . He 's looking him in the eye now . Yes , that 's what the preacher was talking about . If I was in the preacher 's shoes , I guess I might say that them was the kind of cold eyes that look through you . Like a man might stare at you just before he reaches out and chokes the life out of you without even losing his temper . The minister took out his handkerchief and mopped the perspiration from his forehead . He avoided the eyes of the old man . " Today , " he said , " God has fulfilled His prophecy . I warned them , but they would n't listen . " " Sally , " said the old man . " Tell them about Sally. - The minister cut his eyes up at Mr. Roberts and then let them fall again . " Mr. Turner sent a boy over to my house this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come over as soon as I could . I asked the boy what Mr. Turner wanted , but I could n't get anything out of him . Mrs. Turner had a baby . That 's all he knew . " Elmer was watching the two deacons now . Yes , he was thinking , I guess if I was in the preacher 's shoes I might see some cold eyes there too . Like a man might stare at you before he reaches out " I thought they had their gall , " said the minister , " Asking me to come over to christen that baby . But I came over anyhow . Mr. Turner took me in there where his second wife was in his bed . I figured I had n't done a good job of it that day in my house a year ago , so I gave her another talking to . I wanted to let her know what God thought about the way they were living in sin , bringing a child into the world under those circumstances . " When old man Roberts shifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . Elmer was watching the minister . He wanted to see the expression on his face as the old man unbuttoned his shirt . He wanted to know whether the minister had seen the bulge before . M R. ROBERTS took the Colt .45 out and laid it on the table before him as if it had been a pocket knife or a plug of tobacco that was making him uncomfortable . Elmer glanced quickly at the two deacons and Uncle Jimmy , then back at the minister . Their eyes were still fixed on him . They knew it all the time , he was thinking . They knew it the minute he walked in the store . Maybe that 's the reason they did n't ask any questions . But the preacher did n't know . So now he knows what it feels like to turn white as a sheet . The minister recoiled from the sight of the gun as if it had been the body of Sarah Turner 's baby . " I did n't know the child was dead , " he said half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to her was true . " " Sho , " said Flem Mole . " A preacher ought to speak the truth . " The minister 's eyes were focused on the gun now . He had moved over to one side , backed around toward the corner of the room to get out of the line of fire if the gun should happen to go off unexpectedly . " I did n't know they wanted me to conduct the services , " he said . " Sally , " said the old man . " Tell them about Sally . " The minister 's furtive eyes cut across the room like those of a wild animal cornered by a pack of patient , bloodthirsty hounds waiting for him to make a break because they were not satisfied with the short run that he had made . " Mrs. Turner , " he said , " she was crying . It was her that asked me to conduct the services . She had the effrontery to ask me after all I had told her . I could see she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings . God never waits till a sinner is feeling good to deliver the punishment that is his just reward . " " Sho , " said Flem Mole . " He never waits . So you went ahead on and preached the funeral . " " No , " said the minister . " I had warned them and they heeded not . Who was I to stand between the wrath of God and His sinful victim ? " The minister paused when they heard the low moan from beyond the closed door . " I guess she took it pretty hard , " he said . " I meant for her to . So she would get out of that other woman 's bed and ask God 's forgiveness . But she did n't do it . She just turned her face to the wall . So there was nothing for me to do but go home . / can extend the invitation , but I ca n't force a sinner ? " " Sho , " said Flem Mole . " So you washed your hands . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He was here  --  he and his wife both . He never said a word to me . He never opened his mouth . But I know he blames me . " " So you went ahead on home , " said Flem Mote , " and they buried the baby . " " Yes , " said old man Roberts . " Willie wrapped it up in a sheet . He put it in a goods box and took it out there and buried it . Me and my wife could n't stop him . We had our hands full with Sally . " The old man rose slowly from his chair and walked over to the closed door . Opening it quietly , he motioned to the minister and the others . As he stood by the door , the minister passed through , then the two deacons , Uncle Jimmy Hancock , and finally Elmer Doolittle . A kerosene lamp was burning on the table by the bed , the wick turned down low and an old letter stuck in one of the prongs to shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he saw Mrs. Roberts sitting in a split bottom chair on one side of the bed . On the other side Willie Turner was sitting in the same kind of chair , a vacant stare on his face as if he had gone to sleep with his eyes open . Asleep from exhaustion , with the low moan still on his lips . Looking at the bed , Elmer saw what he had known it was inevitable that he would see . Yes , he was thinking , she is dead . Willie has got another funeral to conduct without benefit of clergy . Old man Roberts was still standing by the door . When the minister looked at him , he nodded , indicating that they were to withdraw from the room again . As the others were leaving , Mrs. Roberts got up and came over to Elmer , whispering . " You talk to him , " she said . " He wo n't let us touch her . We 've got to wash the body and send for the undertaker . We 've got to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathetically , patting her on the shoulder . " I will , " he promised . " I 'll try . " Then he turned into the other room and closed the door behind him . O in man Roberts was standing behind the chair in which he had been sitting . He looked at the minister , saying , " Take this seat , Brother Skagmire . " The others were still standing , their eyes on the man in black . The minister sat down reluctantly . He did not understand fully what was going to happen next . " Let me have your watch , " said the old man . Taking out the heavy silver watch , the minister held it up without looking at it . " Lay it on the table , " said Mr. Roberts . As the minister ! aid the watch on the table , his eyes , falling on the gun again , remained fixed . - We 're goin ' outside for a spell , " said the old man . " You make yourself at home . " And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For a long time the four men stared at the minister without moving . Then Elmer glanced at the others one at a time . There 's no more expression on their faces , he was thinking , than if they were wax models in a dry goods store . When Flem Mole turned and walked toward the door , the others did not even look at him . As he closed the screen behind him and disappeared into the darkness , Dave Groom followed , then Uncle Jimmy Hancock . As Elmer turned toward the door , he saw that the minister was still staring at the six-shooter on the table . Outside the door , Elmer walked across the gallery and down the steps , feeling his way on out into the darkness beyond the shaft of dim light from the kerosene lamp . Fifteen or twenty steps away he stopped and listened , waiting for his eyes to become accustomed to the night . Off to the right , near the horses , someone struck a match and cupped his hands . It 's old man Roberts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his watch . Then he heard someone clear his throat silently off to the left . Uncle Jimmy , he said to himself . But where are the deacons ? They all seem to be alone . Elmer moved over a few steps and squatted , leaning against a blackjack sapling . Then he sat down , making himself comfortable . A light wind was rustling through the leaves above him . Elmer breathed deeply , ridding his nostrils of the smell of death . Somewhere out in the darkness he heard a dry rasping sound like an insect of some kind disturbing the stillness of the night . Listening , he heard a clicking , sucking sound like a half-grown kitten washing its face quietly before lying down to sleep . The Disaster That Did n't Happen N A time crowded with threatening disasters , a disaster that did n't I happen is news  --  even if it is not the kind which newspapers bother to print . Last July Harper 's published " The Impending Horror in India , " by Charles Lesley Ames , who set forth a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a great famine .. . one of the most dreadful in recorded history . " He cited estimates  --  and , on the basis of all the known facts , they were conservative  --  that some fifteen million people would starve to death before this summer . This catastrophe has not happened . Moreover , it was not fended off by some miraculous act of God , but by unexpectedly competent human management . The way in which India averted its famine was a great economic and administrative victory . It was , in fact , the country 's most important event of the year , although it has been almost completely obscured by more spectacular political news . A tidal wave and two successive droughts hit India during the 1945-46 food growing season . Grain losses totaled about seven million tons , or the equivalent of a whole year 's food supply for one Indian out of every ten . Virtually no reserves existed , and the diet of the great majority of Indians already was pitifully meager . India appealed to the world for four million tons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Less than half of this amount actually arrived during the most critical six months .
