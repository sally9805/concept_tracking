Henry Ford II , after reading the steel fact finders ' report , said in effect to his executives : " There 's no reason why we should have this shoved down our throats . Let 's take the lead on pensions . " Last week Ford 's Vice President John Bugas offered Walter Reuther an 8 3/4 - an- hour , company-financed pension . <P> The offer ended negotiations which had been going on for almost 100 days . Reuther happily accepted . By all indications , so would Ford workers when they voted on the proposal . By winning peace , Ford had won a lead in his increasingly competitive industry . By winning the contract , Reuther had gained a weapon to use against Chrysler and G.M. <P> Next day , B. F. Goodrich offered 16,000 rubber workers a 10-an-hour pension and insurance program . The Goodrich offer supplemented a small program already in force-one to which workers contributed . The rubber workers ' union accepted and the workers ended a month-old strike . Then the International Harvester Co. offered 65,000 employees a 10-an-hour welfare package-on condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everybody . Those three offers embraced just about all the variations on the principle over which the steel industry was deadlocked . Apparently both industry and labor could be persuaded to modify their stands on the question of employee contributions . The real test was whether the plans would work out in practice . <P> At a quick glance , they seemed to be good propositions for everybody . Ford 's mandatory payments of 8 3/4-an-hour a worker would go into a fund administered by an insurance company , would supplement the 1 1/4-an-hour insurance program already in effect . After 30 years of service at age 65 , workers would be paid enough out of the fund to give them a $100-a-month pension , counting in their Social Security . As Social Security increased , Ford 's part of the obligation would decrease . Ford could count on a lessening of its labor turnover ; workers could look forward to a more secure old age . <P> But the Ford model required some careful looking over . It was not so much a matter of principles as practicalities . U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as their leaders thought they should . <P> No Alternative . Except in some special cases , a worker lost all his credit in the company-financed pension fund unless he stayed with the company until he was 65 ( or 60 , if he had 30 years ' service ) . If he quit his job before that ( e.g. , after 20 years ' service ) , he was left with nothing but his Social Security . <P> Management , for its part , would be saddled with another large fixed charge . As the Ford contract was written , management would have a continuing reason for wanting more , not less , Government-financed , old age insurance . <P> Future negotiators might be able to answer some of the problems raised by the Ford plan . But the basic pattern had been set . Trying to avoid a fourth round of wage rises , U.S. industry had no alternative but to agree to the large , new experiment in one way or another and hope for the best .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
