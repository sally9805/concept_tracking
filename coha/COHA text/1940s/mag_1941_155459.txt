The first reaction to the President 's Budget for the fiscal year 1941-42 came as a reading clerk in the House of Representatives droned : " . . . will cost about 17.5 billions of dollars . " A Congressman whistled . Speaker Sam Rayburn pounded his gavel . The clerk droned on . <P> Later , as members filed out of both Houses , they growled to reporters : " When you jump off a monument , the sensation is fine as long as you keep going " ( Representative Richard Wigglesworth , Massachusetts ) ; " The deficit . . . threatens the solvency of the U. S. The President still believes in spending Government money as if it were water " ( Senator Robert Taft , Ohio ) ; " ... A minimum of what we ought to do . . . " ( Senator Alben Barkley , Kentucky ) ; " My digestion is not good enough to take it down at one gulp " ( Senator Arthur Vandenberg , Michigan ) ; " I 'm for adequate national defense , if it takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " ... a trick budget . . . juggling of figures . . . what we need today is to curtail drastically non-defense spending . . . " ( Senator Harry Byrd , Virginia ) . <P> By next day editorial writers had at least leafed through the Budget 's 1,208 pages of small type , were ready with some more carefully aimed conclusions . <P> A majority seemed to agree with the Senate 's biggest apple-grower and economiser , peeling-paring pinchfist Mr. Byrd . Many went further than Senator Byrd . Furthest went the Washington Post , which asked in an editorial , " Where Is the Sacrifice ? " Said the Post , pointing to the President 's " failure " to cut non-defense expenditures : " This is a strange application of the President 's thesis that sacrifices must be made by everyone in the interests of national security . ... He has recommended only petty economies . . . . " For the same reasons the New York Herald Tribune called the Budget " disheartening . " To the New York Times , striving to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unimpressive . " <P> Budget-porers looked hard at such items as $90,000 for hothouses in the Washington Botanic Gardens ; $849,700 for completion of the National Archives Building , which to the layman 's eye has seemed completed since it was occupied in 1935 ; the addition of 335 new employes to the Railroad Retirement Board ; addition of 1,469 new workers to the Veterans ' Administration ( the State Department got only 35 additional employes ) . Sniffing such apparent piecrust , citizens could well ask : Where is the sacrifice ? The broad outlines of the Budget were simple , partly because the size of the figures made them incomprehensible . In the current fiscal year , ending June 30 , 1941 , the President was trying to spend $13,202,370,970 ; would try to spend $17,485,528,049 in the next fiscal year . Defense called for 28 billions of dollars from June 1940 through June 1942 ; with $6,463,923,900 to spend this fiscal year , $10,811,314,600 next . Aid to Britain would be entirely extra , over &; above the 17.5 billions . Revenues coming in were up now to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
