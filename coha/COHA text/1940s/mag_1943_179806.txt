MOUNT ALLEGRO - Jerre Mangione-Houghton MiffIin ( $2.50 ) . <P> Mount Allegro is the modest , unassuming , sensitive record of a young U.S. writer of Sicilian descent . It is no towering peak in U.S. letters , but readers who make the climb can get a clear view of a relatively unexplored part of the native scene- America 's " Little Italys " and the people who live in them . <P> To the U.S. , during the first decade of the 20th Century , came more than 2,000,000 Italians , part of history 's greatest population movement. * Rootless and adrift in the New World , they formed " foreign language " enclaves such as the one in Rochester , N.Y. , where dark , pun-loving Author Mangione grew up . " Most of my relatives lived in one neighborhood nicknamed Mount Allegro , not more than five or six blocks from each other . That was about as far apart as they could live without feeling that America was a desolate and lonely place . " <P> Life in Mount Allegro was warm , noisy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit of temporary madness tried to kill his brother with a flatiron . Children at too early an age learned the meaning and implications of epithets like strafalaria ( genteel translation : loose woman ) . And often , at night , the sky hung like a smoldering sulphurous ceiling above the optical factory that squatted on the banks of the Genesee River . " Underneath it my relatives sang and played guitars and , if they noticed the sky at all , they were reminded of the lemon groves in Sicily . They were stubborn poets . " More deeply glowing than the sky above the factory was the inherited canopy of Catholicism . " Their Catholicism , like their lives , was enveloped in a heavy blanket of fatalism . . . . There might be a great deal of noisy emotionalism among my relatives over a misfortune . . . but eventually it was laid on the doorstep of Destiny . ' E tu - Destino ! ' That single phrase explained everything . " <P> But one thing even E tu Destino could not explain-the sense of loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange and alien in a strangely alien land . At school the second generation were told that if they were born here they were American , but " then one day one of your new teachers looked at you brightly and said you were Italian because your last name was Amoroso and that too was puzzling . " You talked it over with your father but he was n't very helpful . " Your children will be Americani , but you , my son , are half-and-half . . . . What do you learn in school , anyway ? " <P> Author Mangione 's search for a more valid identity and sense of place than is implied by " half-and-half " led him to books , to the studies of the sociologists , finally to Sicily itself . " ... I began asking myself questions like these : Was it in the chemistry of human life for my relatives to become Anglo-Saxonized-the apparent goal of the melting pot theorists ? . . . Was it necessary that they try to change themselves ? Did n't America need their wisdom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America 's youth and vigor ? "
