 | Antidotes for Allergy By Paul de Kalif IF YOU 'RE one of the country 's estimated io , 000,000 allergics , you can bless our organic chemists for two new antidotes . One is a little greenish pill called pyribenzaminc ; the other is a pink capsule named benadryl . These twin antidotes ( not cures ) will not allow hay-fever victims to discard their pollen shots ; but the new chemicals boost the power and lessen the discomfort of these pesky immunizations , and they lessen a great variety of allergic torture where shots are ineffective . Allergy is more than the joke of hay-fever kerchoos , the itching of hives or an ache in the head . It 's a deep chemical jangle that may begin at infancy and last for life . It is the most fantastic of all sicknesses because of the infinite variety of its outside causes . Nobody knows why one person is allergic and another is n't . Allergies are people who can stand an irritant when they 're first exposed to it ? and then , on later exposure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ache . The threats to the health and comfort of allergics are legion . For example , normal people feel little ill effect from a clucking in cold water , yet strong swimmers have drowned because of an allergy to cold . Thousands of workmen develop serious allergic skin trouble ? contact dermatitis ? in chemical industry . Some people are allergic even to sunlight . One spoonful of food to which a person is sensitive may swell up his lips and tongue gigantically and shut his throat . Doctors are becoming more and more disturbed at the way certain modern lifesaving remedies can turn upon allergic patients who have to use , them repeatedly . Penicillin causes hives and joint pains in many who need its magic at intervals ; doctors are now on guard before giving sulfa , asking every patient whether he has experienced previous serious allergic reactions .  | For 40 years scientists have been groping for a simple chemical answer to the allergic mystery . At first they believed that the allergic reaction was caused by some sort of poison introduced into the body from outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or any protein that was n't his own . At the first dose he 'd never bat an eye . Yet this seemingly innocent shot worked a mysterious change in the unhappy animal . Inject the same stuff two weeks later , and he 'd sneeze , begin asthmatic wheezing , perhaps die . The sneezing and wheezing were dead ringers for human hay fever and asthma . But if the guinea pig did n't die , then for weeks he was proof against further injections of the protein that had almost killed him . And little doses , day after day , could actually immunize a guinea pig against this allergic shock . That was the foundation of the extended series of shots that protect us against hay fever and other ills . Immunizing by these shots is slow , tedious and expensive ; it may protect a victim in a year when pollen is light and break down when pollen is profuse . Hundreds of thousands of persons are allergic , but since their physicians can not find out to what , they can not be immunized . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be immunized at all . Way back in 1910 an Englishman , Sir Henry Dale ( now a Nobel Prize man ) , stumbled accidentally upon the trail of the allergic villain . He was investigating the poisonous rye fungus , ergot . It was startling how one of the organic chemicals in ergot , histamine ? which is also present in our bodies ? could set off allergic shocks in guinea pigs that perfectly mimicked human allergic explosions . For many years this finding went almost unnoticed . But in the early 1930 's , the allergy men harked back to Sir Henry Dale 's experiment . They performed tests which seemed to show that the culprit was indeed histamine . Yet they could n't prove this to be true so long as they could n't control human allergy by some definite histamine-antidote . For years , from hundreds of laboratories and hospitals , came published hopes of an antidote to histamine ? all uniformly disappointing when they tried to relieve sneezing , wheezing , itching and aching allergic human beings . Then , in 1942 , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came the exciting scientific news of anti-histaminic 2339 RP . This substance , safe to use on human beings , seemed to relieve many of the torments of hay fever , hives and the fiendish itching of allergic dermatitis . This was the pay-off of more than 25 years of failure . Histamine now stood convicted as the dominant villain in human allergy . In most people it was harmless , but in others it could react to some external influence by a violent allergic action . The news excited American chem-  | ists to brew more powerful antihistaminics . From the laboratories of Parke Davis &; Company in Detroit came the pink capsule , benadryl . In the hands of a large body of cooperating physicians testing it , benadryl relieved a high proportion of hives , allergic eczema , penicillin and sulfa allergies , and many cases of hay fever . Meanwhile chemists of the Ciba laboratories in Summit , N. J. , produced the little greenish pills , pyribenzamine ? now nicknamed PBZ . PBZ pills showed power over a variety of allergies . For instance , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicken . He had hay fever and asthma . Immunizing shots had failed to control his suffering ; but PBZ made him comfortable . A woman ragweed-sensitive had hay fever so severely that she could sleep only an hour or two at a time . PBZ on retiring gave her six or seven hours of uninterrupted sleep . A scientist for years had suffered multiple allergies to tree pollens , June grass , house dust , cat dander , and spinach . PBZ brought him relief . But it must be remembered that protection is by no means perfect in all allergies ; some remain unprotected . Neither the pink capsules nor the greenish pills hit at what fundamentally makes people allergic ( that 's still mysterious ) , but they do help to combat the poisonous histamine that 's released by allergic explosions . Their effect is temporary , lasting only a few hours . Yet , so great is their power over allergies formerly uncontrollable that they have caused much excitement among allergy experts . Drs . Carl E. Arbesman and George F. Koepf , of the University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among 495 patients . There were 49 seasonal hay-fever victims who , in spite of immunization shots , still had some symptoms during the pollen season . PBZ definitely relieved all but five . Among 93 patients with perennial rhinitis ( year-round hay fever ) who still had discomfort after other treatments , 83 were made more comfortable with PBZ . Of course , as with all drugs , some few people are found to be allergic to PBZ or benadryl itself ? the very drugs that protect most people from allergy ! How do doctors choose between the greenish pills and pink capsules ? Dr. Samuel Feinberg of Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago has tested their comparative power upon more than 500 allergic patients . At knocking out hives , relieving the itching of eczema and combatting had penicillin reactions they ran neck and neck . But against the most widespread of all allergies ? hay fever PBZ was definitely more powerful than benadryl , relieving better than eight out of ten sufferers . Yet benadryl ca n't be discarded , because many a patient getting no relief from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drugs in ordinary doses are not dangerous , they should be used only under the strict supervision of physicians . They can be obtained only by prescription . Both have definite side effects in certain cases . For instance , specialists who have had considerable experience with PBZ and benadryl say that patients should be warned that either drug may produce soporific effects which must be guarded against . A single dose of benadryl ( or PBZ ) can make you drowsy ; while using the drug you may be inclined to nod and drop to sleep unexpectedly . One patient taking PBZ fell asleep while driving her car and crashed into the pillars of the Queensboro Bridge in Manhattan . Sc the doctors warn : Do n't drive a car ( or engage in any activity that requires concentration or conscious control ) while taking either benadryl or PBZ . Nursing mothers , using either drug , may pass on the soporific effects on their babies . No harm will be done to the child ; but the pediatrician ( unaware that the mother is taking the drugs ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some type of illness . The doctors also warn that in some cases of asthma , hives and intestinal allergies the symptoms may increase after taking these drugs . Will PBZ and benadryl revolutionize the treatment of the nation 's most widespread misery , hay fever ? The consensus of allergy specialists is that by far the most cornplete protection occurs in people who have been immunized by pollen shots and then - when necessary ? also help guard themselves by PBZ during the hay-fever season . It must not be forgotten that the shots , when effective , are more lasting . They are also powerful preventives of asthma , which is not effectively prevented by either PBZ or benadryl . The Committee on Therapy of the Academy of Allergy feels that whether pollen shots can be discarded will be solved by the hayfever patients themselves , " who will undoubtedly try this medicament ( PBZ ) and settle this controversial point out of their own experience . " A new PBZ ointment is used for skin conditions such as eczema , poison ivy and allergic dermatitis . It stops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceases , greatly speeding the healing of sores and eruptions . Benadryl and PBZ are putting a powerful tool for diagnosis into the hands of practicing physicians . A great deal of sinus trouble , a vast number of recurrent so-called head colds ( not infections ) , countless cases of chronic indigestion , colitis and conditions resembling gall-bladder disease are basically allergic . Doses of the new anti-histaminics may help give the doctor a clear-cut answer and may prevent needless operations . Of course the little greenish pills and pink capsules do n't cure allergy . Hay-fever sufferers should certainly not abandon their shots , to depend  | on these pills and capsules alone . Laboratories are still humming with research for more powerful pills and more solid immunizations . Meanwhile hay-fever sufferers whose noses are streaming and feel as if they 're invaded by armies of ants , and whose heads feel like accordions , probably wo n't mind if they 're only " palliated , " not cured , so long as the pills and capsules can go on making them comfortable .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
