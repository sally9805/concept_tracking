In the early morning hours of Friday , Nov. 27 , Marshal Petain was awakened in Vichy to receive a letter from Adolf Hitler . His eyes still bemused by sleep , the old man read the words that ended his last vain hope of building up a new French state on the terms of the armistice signed at Compiegne . Because of " treachery " on the part of high officers of the French armed forces , the Fhrer wrote , he had ordered the demobilization of the remaining units of Vichy 's Army and Navy . The great naval base of Toulon , last remaining bit of the free zone , was to be occupied , the warships stationed there taken or " annihilated " to prevent their escape to the Allies . Control of all France would pass into the hands of Field Marshal Karl Rudolf Gerd von Rundstedt , Commander of German armed forces in Occupied France and the Low Countries . The letter - many pages long-concluded with the " hope that cooperation thus is initiated from which we expect on France 's part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe . " <P> In the harbor of Toulon , spread out beneath the dark houses of the sleeping city , 62 vessels of the French Navy-battleships , cruisers , destroyers , submarines and France 's only seaplane carrier-were lying quietly at anchor or tied up at their piers , as they had lain for nearly two and a half years since the summer when France fell . At the city 's gates soldiers of the French Army stood on guard . To the east , the sky was paling with the first light of dawn . <P> With shocking surprise , the stillness was shattered . German armored forces and motorized infantry bore down on the town from all sides . Once inside they sped for the harbor . At the Porte de Castigneau , leading to the naval base , there was a brief , sharp skirmish with French soldiers before the entry was forced . <P> Simultaneously German bombers roared in over the docks , dropped flares , circled to identify the warships ' positions . Over the roadstead leading out to sea parachute mines floated down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crews sprang to their stations . Searchlights stabbed out , anti-aircraft batteries opened up from the ships and ashore . From the flagship of Vice Admiral Jean de Laborde , commander of the fleet , a signal was given : <P> " Carry out Order B. " <P> Suicide of a Fleet . The first German armored force , having fought its way into the base , reached Milhaud dock where the battleship Strasbourg was lying . As German officers leaped from their cars and ran to the gangplanks , there was a flash and a roar and the great , 26,500-ton ship disintegrated before their eyes . <P> Roar followed roar from all parts of the harbor as ship after ship exploded . German troops raced for the Vauban Basin where the battleship Dunkerque had been tied up for repairs since the British attack on Oran in July 1940 . Near by were the cruisers Algrie , Foch and Jean de Vienne ; their docks were wrecked with them . Earth and air trembled as the beautiful ships destroyed themselves .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
