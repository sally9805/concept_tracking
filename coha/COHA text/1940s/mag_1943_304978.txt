Australian and American artillery set the broad-leafed jungles aquiver last week as they roared an unexpected challenge to the Japs in Salamaua . Somehow through the jungles Allied 105s and other artillery had miraculously been lugged into position . With the aid of the guns Allied troops began storming the gates of the Japanese stronghold . Having chopped and shot their way through jungle to within five miles of it , they now needed artillery to battle for high ground . <P> The Japs , well knowing that loss of the commanding ridges above Salamaua would seal its doom , fought desperately . To counter the Allied guns they had a few 75-mm. and 6-in. guns , but for the most part relied on their bombproof burrows , mortars and machine guns . <P> The Japs used many a battle-scarred trick . Said a U.S. officer : ' " The moment we take an objective we have to organize our perimeters quickly , for the Japs . . . strike back immediately in localized counterattacks . " Public-address systems were brought up by the Japs to make noisy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear . But , said the American officer , " our boys are awake to all these tricks . They have not been confused . . . and have held their fire like veterans . " <P> When artillery scorched and tumbled the hillsides , the Jap holed in . But to cover the 40 to 60 yards necessary for direct assault sometimes took the Allied soldiers five or ten minutes , and the Jap popped out swiftly to man his machine guns . Occasionally cliffs had to be scaled , hand over hand with the help of thorny lawyer vines : the Jap , creeping from his caves , pulled the pins from mortar bombs , dropped them on the attackers . Such fighting necessarily slowed the Allied onslaught . Patrols probed ahead to pinpoint enemy positions . Plane and artillery bombardment constantly softened the Jap defenses . But direct assaults had to be made against limited objectives because of the tangle and sheerness of the country . Gradually , however , the Jap was being dislodged , pressed back to the defensible peninsula of Salamaua itself .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
