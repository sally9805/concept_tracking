txt The United States can not be put in a secure state of national defense until the problem of unemployment is solved and a better distribution of the national income is achieved , John L. Lewis , president of the Congress of Industrial Organizations , said today in a Labor Day address over the National Broadcasting System . Accomplishment of these ends , he asserted , would permit the acquisition of $6,000,000,000 of arms simultaneously with the addition to the assets of the nation of another $25,000,000,000 of purchasing power for normal peacetime needs . " A program to accomplish this end , " he declared , " is the kind of a program labor envisages for the real defense of the nation . " Mr. Lewis said that the C. I. 0 . was aiding strongly toward such an objective through organization to increase wages and protect the rights of workers . Since last Labor Day , he added , the C. I. 0 . had gained " many hundreds of thousands " of members and " the few remaining bastions of anti-unionism in American industry are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company , at the plants of which , he said , the Steel Work- ers Organizing Committee was actively organizing . The United Automobile Workers of the C. I. 0. , he added , was moving to organize the aviation industry . This industry , " one of the richest and most pampered , " he declared , was working employes fifty and sixty hours a week for wages a third less than for similar work in the motor industry . The Construction Workers Organizing Committee , which has just celebrated its first anniversary , was making progress in the building field , he said , adding that as a result of its establishment improvements in technique had taken place in the industry which promised better and cheaper homes for the American people . Mr. Lewis declared the C. I. 0 . confidently offered to take its place in the defense of the nation . He asserted , however , that there were men in high places who did not want labor to participate in the national effort and who , for this reason , spread the " falsehood " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from being adequately armed . On the contrary , Mr. Lewis said , it was greedy industrialists who were to blame in France . Men of the same type in Britain , he added , endangered British preparedness and the threat was not met until leaders of labor were put in the British Cabinet . Assails Draft Proponents Mr. Lewis attacked advocates of peacetime conscription , asserting that they were seeking to create an atmosphere of hysteria , knowing that only by such means could they attain their ends . Those who initiated the conscription bill and introduced it in Congress , he said , were men whose records of opposition to measures for the welfare of the people generally were consistent . Peacetime conscription he described as " one of the major planks in the platform of reaction , standing beside calls for repeal of the Fair Labor Standards Act , the scuttling of the National Labor Relations Act and the destruction of our civil liberties . " He held that an adequate army could be obtained through voluntary enlistment if the enlistment period were shortened to a year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private debts assumed or suspended , return to private jobs guaranteed , Social Security protection continued and the upper ranks of the Army opened to enlisted men . But even more important in the nation 's defense , Mr. Lewis declared , was the improvement of the economic conditions of all the workers so they would feel they had something worth defending . " Labor demands adequate representation upon the policy making agencies of government , " Mr. Lewis concluded . " Labor demands adequate representation , and not on the basis that now exists , of one lonely representative of labor , to 100 millionaires . The ancient and puissant British Empire found it necessary to invoke and accept labor 's aid , labor 's policies and labor 's statesmen . Why should the combined forces of wealth and politics in our own land cling to the pitiful belief that they can do any less ? Says Parties Are in Test " Within the coming months and years , labor and the common people of the country , the aged , the youth , the Negroes &; have several choices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two major political parties , constituted and directed as they are , can fulfill the nation 's needs . These decisions will be made upon the basis of what our present political leaders do to meet the needs of our people . " Our great domestic problems remain unsolved . Unemployment , which is the greatest of the questions which confront us , still menaces our prosperity , our security and our happiness . For years , labor , farmers and others have unceasingly called for a national conference on this subject . No steps have been taken , and no plans have been made for the abatement of this monstrous evil . Those who believe that the making of guns will solve the question of national unemployment have little comprehension and smaller understanding of the play of the world 's economic forces . - " With the coming of peace between the warring nations will also come a new and terrible depression of catastrophic proportions . t Ve can not wait until its arrival to lay plans and devise measures to meet it . It is time for Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statesmen to give some attention to their own nation and . its own problems . It is time for all ' Americans to become articulate and to demand consideration of American problems , if America , as we know it , is to be preserved . "
