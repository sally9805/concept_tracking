When Thomas Jefferson penned a letter expounding a revolutionary idea or explaining the difference between dry , sweet and astringent wines , he noted the correspondence in his Epistolary Record . That fact will be of great help for the next ten years to Princeton University 's Librarian Julian Parks Boyd . He is preparing the first complete edition of the writings of the first complete U.S. philosopher . <P> It is 40 years since a 20-volume edition made available a mere tithe of Jefferson 's letters . The new edition-costs of $344,300 to be shared by the New York Times and Princeton-will consist of 50 richly designed volumes . It will include all of Jefferson 's major writings and speeches , his 18,624 known letters , plus texts or references to the 21,696 letters known to have been written to him . Search will be made for additional letters . New light may thus shine both on Jefferson 's thought and on U.S. history . <P> The project will be a memorial to Timesman Adolph Simon Ochs . Said Princeton President Harold Willis Dodds last week : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free , and every man able to read , all is safe , ' he voiced a belief that today has greater meaning . . . . This . . . was also the lifelong conviction of the great journalist . . . Adolph S. Ochs , who also advanced the idea of a responsible press . It is . . . appropriate that a university dedicated to free inquiry , aided by a free and responsible newspaper , should present . . . the complete writings of the man who swore ' eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind . ' " * <P> The 1,000 sets of the Ochs memorial edition will be printed on durable 25% rag paper , with format by the Princeton University Press 's art director , P. Jefferson Conkwright . Included will be the first collected volume of Jefferson 's sketches and architectural drawings , many of which are classics of housing history . Considerable use will be made of microfilm in preparing the edition , and the linotype men will set largely from photographs of the letters . <P> South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctorate at Franklin &; Marshall . He is a distinguished younger U.S. historian , has collaborated with such able writers as Franklin biographer Carl Van Doren and the University of Pennsylvania 's Roy Franklin Nichols . With hobbies running from gardening to handsetting type , Boyd shares some of Jefferson 's own tastes . Among topics of lasting interest treated with passion and discrimination in the writings of the great Virginian : politics , government , history , art , science , literature , agriculture , music , architecture , education , mathematics , business , newspapers , wine-drinking . <P> *Today 86.5% of all adult Americans are technically literate .
