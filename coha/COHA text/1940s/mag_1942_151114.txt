Each day opened with fresh withdrawal , closed with fresh defeat . In the five weeks since war 's outbreak , the Japanese had driven 200 miles south . Last week was the worst . It opened with the British hanging on below the tin center , Ipoh . It closed with the British 100 miles south in grim retreat below the Federated Malay States ' capital and rubber center , Kuala Lumpur . <P> At that point nearly all of Malaya 's tin and rubber was gone ; now only the naval base was left and its site . Singapore , was already within such close reach of the Japanese Air Force that the base could no longer be called importantly naval . <P> Victorious As Ever . Pacing the enemy south was the Ever-Victorious Fifth . Every Japanese patriot long since learned about the Ever-Victorious Fifth ; now the Allies were learning the hard way . Battle laurels of Japan 's crack Fifth Division go back to the Russo-Japanese War . Once mummy-faced Lieut . General Seishiro Itagaki himself commanded it . It had smacked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacked Taiyiian , fought at Schow . It had spearheaded the spectacular Japanese drive on Nanning in 1939 . <P> If the Fifth were to inscribe Singapore on its roll of battle honors , the entire strategy of the United Nations would require revision . Control of Singapore would give the Japanese easy access to the Indian Ocean . Both Britain 's Indian Empire and her Middle Eastern Front ( supplied through the Indian Ocean and Red Sea ) would be menaced . <P> The British Command knew just one thing could make the difference between success or failure . That was aid promised from the U.S. and Britain , which presumably was well on the way .
