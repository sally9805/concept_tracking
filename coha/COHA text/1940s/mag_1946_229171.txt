Symbols of a prewar era that now seems as remote as the Gay Nineties , the Trylon &; Perisphere are gone . But the World 's Fair site at Flushing , N.Y . remains . There next week ( Oct. 23 ) the U.N . ' s 51 nations will open the first meeting of the General Assembly in the U.S. <P> Each nation may send five representatives and five alternates . With their camp followers they will total some 2,000 souls ; Manhattan hotelmen feared their already jammed buildings would burst . It was encouraging that Russia was fielding its first team , led by Molotov and Vishinsky . <P> <P> Minister of State Philip Noel-Baker will be calling signals for Britain , Foreign Minister Bidault for France , ex-Senator Warren Austin of Vermont for the U.S. Bevin and Byrnes will show up later , when the Council of Foreign Ministers takes up treaty recommendations handed on from Paris ( see above ) . <P> The Assembly-which is U.N . ' s policymaker , supervisor and purse-holder-already has more than 50 subjects on its provisional agenda , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops in non-enemy countries to a proposed international children 's fund ( which U.N . ' s Economic &; Social Council had unanimously approved as " a noble goal " ) . Other problems : election of new members , choice of a permanent U.N . site , what to do with Franco Spain , a Russian-backed move for compulsory repatriation of refugees . Before he is through , many a delegate will look longingly around the Fair site for the vanished Aquacade , kootch dancers-and parachute jump .
