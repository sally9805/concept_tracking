King Solomon , who wrote songs about a love so strong that it made his stomach ache , was well aware that a man 's emotions can make him sick . Not all of Solomon 's wisdom has been forgotten . Last week , at the American College of Physicians ' annual meeting in Chicago , 3,500 U.S. doctors heard , among other reports , some specific examples of how sick a man can be if he gets too wrought up over things . <P> Violent and prolonged anger can play havoc with body tissues , said Dr. Harold G. Wolff of Cornell Medical College . A furious man - or even a peevish one who constantly takes umbrage - gets too much blood in his stomach walls ; if he stays angry too long , ulcers may result . The fury or sulking fits aroused by threats to a man 's life or his love , said Dr. Wolff , sometimes affects his nose : it may swell up and hurt . A " mad " nose , caught with its resistance down , is easy prey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freeman and James Watts of George Washington University , pioneers in psychosurgery , told of having performed prefrontal lobotomy - a brain operation which frees the patient from feelings of anxiety and fear - on patients who were suffering unbearable pain from chronic disease ( TIME , Dec. 23 ) . The operation had no effect on the disease , and did nothing to lessen the pain ; but the patients , freed of anxiety , now found their suffering bearable , and some even laughed at it . The doctors ' conclusion : " When pain no longer raises a mental picture of future disability , it can be borne with equanimity . " <P> Probably the most dubious statement of the week , to laymen 's ears , came from the University of Illinois ' famed Dr. Andrew C. Ivy . Most of the pain people feel during dental drilling , said he , is no doubt only psychic . <P> Anxiety dreams caused by emotional frustrations sometimes scare people to death , said Dr. Sylvan H. Robertson of Chicago 's Michael Reese Hospital . In such dreams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a state of tension . " Possible result : a heart attack while sleeping . <P> Philadelphia 's Dr. Edward L. Bortz , president-elect of the A.M.A. , had a prescription ready for the whole nation : take it easy , get enough sleep and recreation , develop a sense of humor . That way , he thought , the insatiable spirit can be kept from tearing the fragile flesh to pieces . Chicago Heart Specialist Louis N. Katz , who thinks even card games are too strenuous , went further : " Never try competition-not even with your own golf par . "
