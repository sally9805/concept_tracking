Virginia Lewis might well have showed stage fright , but she did n't . When she stepped on the stage at Philadelphia 's Robin Hood Dell one night last summer , before the Philadelphia Orchestra and Conductor Alexander Smallens , she had never sung with an orchestra . She had not been rehearsed for this concert . She had just been handed an unfamiliar arrangement of two songs from George Gershwin 's Porgy and Bess . Someone had stepped on her gown and ripped it . But the chunky , dignified , dark brown Negro soprano let loose a voice for which everyone , including Conductor Smallens , predicted a future . Last week , 26-year-old Soprano Lewis made her second big-time concert appearance . For a publicity sounding board , she had the best there is : the music room ( East Room ) of the White House , in Mrs. Roosevelt 's first musicale of the season . <P> Virginia Lewis ' start was much like another Philadelphia Negro 's , Contralto Marian Anderson .

Artists are asked not to brag much in the press about their White House dates , and few do .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
