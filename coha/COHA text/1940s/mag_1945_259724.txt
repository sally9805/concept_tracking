London turned out last week for a gala premiere of a film which the U.S. may not see for another year . <P> Caesar and Cleopatra ( Gaumont-British ) is Yorkshireman J. Arthur Rank 's most spectacular production gamble in cinema 's newly competitive international game . With Vivien ( Scarlett O'Hara ) Leigh , Claude Rains and a $5,000,000 production in Technicolor , Rank hopes to put British movies-as represented by Arthur Rank-into real competition with Hollywood . The $66 million-a-year rental which Britain pays for U.S. films is involved-about half enough money to meet the proposed payments on Britain 's new U.S. loan . <P> To screen George Bernard Shaw 's 47-year-old play , Rank gave Producer Gabriel ( " Gabby " ) Pascal a free hand and an open purse . After the London showing , TIME Correspondent Wilmott Ragsdale cabled : <P> " Most of London 's critics seemed to feel that Caesar and Cleopatra is a good enough picture to draw American crowds .

He endured buzz-bombs , suffered while Britain 's dreary weather kept thousands of extras waiting for Technicolor sunshine . Because he was unimpressed by the real Sphinx , Gabby built a full-scale replica in Egypt . ' Every human and inanimate detail I made my own responsibility , ' Gabby said . Yet he had no critical eye for the script , and this oversight robbed him of the cheers his egotism requires . <P> " The cast was competent and even excellent , from Claude Rains ' gently wise and balding Caesar and the clawless kitten of Cleopatra Leigh to the Nubian slave who wheeled back the massive palace portals . But as the petulant kitten queen grew under Caesar 's tutelage into a cat-clawed ruler , the plot slipped and dragged and Shaw 's motives grew muddled . Pascal expects his movie to be a success : ' It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went away after two hours and 15 minutes with their money 's worth , but not quite sure what Shaw was philosophizing about . Gabby 's straining seemed to have brought forth not exactly a mouse but a Technicolor camel , exotic but un-romantic. "
