Put into port , the Shoals are calling ; <P> Come where the lighthouse gleams . <P> Come in to rest , and furl your sails , <P> And lose yourself in dreams . . . . <P> To a world-weary outsider , these sentimental lines would scarcely seem to fit the barren , rocky acres of Star Island , one of the nine Isles of Shoals off New Hampshire 's brief coast . But to the religiously liberal Unitarian Fellowship , these and the other two stanzas of the song Gosport Harbor , explain the intangible atmosphere of peace that makes Star Island a favorite summer retreat . For half a century Unitarians have gone from some 24 states " to worship God here in the midst of His sea to take counsel together of the deep thing that abide , to share the friendship and the hope of a common faith . . . .

Like the Unitarians , they poked for gulls ' eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lectures , held seminars and attended services in the little Gosport Meeting House . But , also like the Unitarians , they spent much of their time sitting in silent meditation . <P> Isolated Charm . Star Island 's chief attraction to both sects is its remoteness . Nine miles from the mainland , it has only one link with the world : a ferry which makes the trip twice daily . Nowhere is there a radio , a telephone or a newspaper ; the Island 's ancient Oceanic Hotel , built in 1873 by mustard tycoon John R. Poor ( a Unitarian ) , has no running water , no baths . Said Congregationalist " Shoaler " Donald A. Adams : " You have nothing else to think about except religion . " <P> Every night at 10 o'clock , the Shoalers hold a candlelight service in the spirit of their hymn : <P> We leave our sadness and unrest <P> Down by the restless tide ; <P> We climb a hill of love to find <P> Our crosses glorified . <P> Carrying candles protected by glass chimneys , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the little church , whose bell tolls solemnly above the rumble of the surf . At service 's end the worshipers take up their candles and walk out , the last to leave shutting the door upon the darkened church . Silently all file back to the hotel .
