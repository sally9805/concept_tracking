txt In The Nation Two Presidents on Labor ? and a Correction By ARTHUR HROCK WASHINGTON , Nov. ** President today addressed the Washington conference of the International Labor Office in an atmosphere of industrial disputes made more heavily foreboding by renewed strike talk among the representatives of railroad workers at Chicago . As he spoke , the National Defense Mediation Board was struggling with the ultimatum of John L. Lewis that there must be a union shop in all the captive mines of the steel companies or an end of coal production therein , with sympathetic walkouts in large sections of armament industry a possible further consequence . On the strike roster compiled by the press associations other industrial disputes were chronicled this day of the I. L. 0 . speech : Among welders in airplane factories on the West Coast ; between A. F. of L. teamsters and the Railway Express Agency at Detroit , where the hauling of supplies is vital to a key defense program area . The President told the I. L. 0 . that among the " few * * * who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are industrialists as well as leaders of labor . But , he added , " the American people have made an unlimited commitment that there shall be a free world . Against that commitment no individual or group shall prevail . " * * * Mr. Roosevelt quoted President Lincoln 's definition that the strongest bond of human sympathy is a union of workers all over the world . But even nearer to his thesis that no group shall be permitted to prevail over a whole people are passages from the speech made at Long Branch , N. J. , Sept. 23 , 1916 , by Woodrow Wilson in opening his campaign for re-election . The threat of a railroad strike had just been averted by strong government policy and the passage of the Adamson eight-hour-day law . The President said : " These men were dealing with one another as if the only thing to settle was between themselves , whereas the real thing to settle was what rights had the hundred million people of the United States . The business of the government is to see that no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no body or group of men , no matter what their private interest is , may come into competition with the authority of society . * * * " We all know , or , at any rate , we pretend to know , what we ought to do , but we do not all know how to do it , and the very difficult question which the American people is now face to face with , and which they are going to settle , is this : ' How are we going to organize our participation as a partner in the settlement of disputes between capital and labor which interrupt the life of the nation ? ' * * * " The question is apt to be obscured in some quarters , as if we were saying that it was the right of the government or of organized society , which is another term for the same thing , to say to a man : ' You must work whether you want to or not . ' America is never going to say to any individual , ' You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is privileged to say to an organization of persons : ' You must not interrupt the national life without consulting us . ' It is not a. question of obliging individuals ; it is a question of enforcing a partnership and seeing to it that no organization is stronger than that organization which we all belong to and support and call and love by the name of our own government . " In the war that followed soon thereafter Mr. Wilson enforced his words by policy and act . * * * One of the ablest and most tolerant I members of Congress is Representative Charles A. Halleck of Indiana . In his nominating speech for Mr. Willkie at Philadelphia , successfully challenging the die-hard regulars and the old guardsmen , he asked : " Is the Republican party a closed corporation ? Do you have to be born in it ? " This attitude has been reinforced steadily by a liberal record in Congress . Therefore , there was much astonishment  --  shared by and commented on by this correspondent Tuesday  --  when the United Press reported from French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his dispatch , that Mr. Halleck , Senator Willis and four other Indiana Republicans in Congress had issued a manifesto which , in effect , sought to read Mr. Willkie out of the party for his views on foreign policy , opposed to their own . This correspondent , checking further , was informed by Indiana political observers in Washington that the manifesto was real . It now develops that no proclamation of this sort or any other was issued by the Indiana Republicans at French Lick . Through an error of a kind most rare in the reports of the United Press , a simple radio symposium in which Mr. Halleck participated  --  and in which Mr. Willkie 's name was not mentioned and Mr. Halleck never discussed foreign policy  --  was metamorphosed into an attempted purge by manifesto . The . proof is absolute , the reparation due to Mr. Halleck , who has always insisted that partisanship has no place in foreign policy .
