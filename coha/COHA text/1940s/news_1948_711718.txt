txt Adolf A. Berle Jr. , former Assistant Secretary Of State , inchcated yesterday that current disclosures had necessitated a reappraisal by him of the charges of Communist infiltration in high Government places that were brought to him by Whittaker Chambers in 1939 . He made it evident that he now took a much more serious view of them . After testifying for several hours before the special Federal Grand Jury inquiring into espionage and subvers , veness . Mr. Berle repeated his assertion that he h , id taker , every investigatory action that seemed warranted at the tune but added the observation that " of course , there was no clear evidence then . " " The situation , " he said , " was not the same as it is now . " As recently as last Aug. 30 Mr. , Berle had told a subcommittee of the House Un-American Activities , Committee , before whirl- he ap- ' peared here ' as a voluntary witness , that he had taken all measures available to him to check Mr. Chambers ' story . The story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brother , Donald , had been " Communist sympathizers " two years earlier  --  in 1937 . Commenting on Mr. Chambers ' testimony last summer  --  before he had produced any seemingly incriminating documents  --  Mr. Berle had said : " The idea that the two Hiss boys and Nat Witt Nathan Witt , former National Labor Relations Board aide were going to take over the United States Government was childish . " Mr. Berle still insisted yesterday that there was " nothing about espionage " in his conversation with Mr. Chambers in 1939 . Informed that Mr. Chambers only a few minutes earlier had told reporters ' it was his recollection that he had designated both the Hiss brothers as " Communists " in the conversation , Mr. Berle said he remembered only Donald Hiss as having been so characterized . He added that he had " no clear recollection " of a conversation that took place so many years ago . Mr. ' Berle said he did recall being told the Hiss brothers were partial to the pro-Soviet bloc in the State Department . Mr. Berle has admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the war with a faction headed by Dean Acheson , Under-Secretary of State . Mr. Berle had espoused a " get ttough " attitude toward Russia in 1944 , while Mr. Acheson took the opposite tack , Mr. Berle has testified . By that time Alger Hiss was a principal assistant to Mr. Acheson in this field . Chambers Gives More Details Mr. Chambers did an aboutface yesterday on his recent avoidance of reporters and virtually invited their questioning at length . This was not without purpose , as it developed . Emerging from the Grand Jury room on the fourteenth floor of the Federal Building , he made the positive statement that he had told Mr. Berle at their dinner meeting in Mr. Berle 's Washington home that both the Hiss brothers were Communists . He regaled the reporters with a lurid tale of a bargain proferred by " the Communists " after he broke with them in 1938 by which protection for his wife and two children would be vouchsafed in exchange for his own " surrender . " This alleged " deal , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the self-styled former courier for a pre-war Soviet spy ring " apparatus " in Washington reverted to his stock " no comment " retort when asked directly whether he had told the grand jury that the Hiss brothers actually had turned over to him any " restricted " Government papers . He has charged that Alger Hiss was one of several Government employes who had " supplied " documents to him . Mr. Hiss ' answer was the filing of a $75,000 libel suit against Mr. Chambers that brought to light the microfilmed " pumpkin papers " and an unqualified denial of the accusations . Getting back to his ten-year-old " death threat " story Mr. Chambers went into detail . He said that the ' offer of safety for his family was ' made in 1938 , shortly after he left the party , by a woman Communist who was a witness at his wedding in 1931 . She made it , he said , through his wife 's brother , a lawyer . Says He Hid for Year Spurning the bizaare tender ? whose actual source he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house outside of Baltimore for almost a year . oln that period he and his wife , he declared , maintained a constant vigil with a shotgun , spelling each other at the watches , day and night . He still has the shotgun on his farm near Westminster , Md. , where the films were found in the hollowed-out pumpkin , he said . He added that he had *no particular fears for his or his family 's safety now , since the Communist party was " coldly realistic and would have nothing to gain by harming us at this time , except possibly as a precautionary effect " on others who might be inclined to follow his course . Mr. Chambers reaffirmed his willingness to undergo a lie-detector test , suggested by members of the House committee . He had no comment at first when he was asked if he knew Eleanor Wilson , a former Government employe who had testified before the grand jury on Monday . Later he acknowledged that he had seen her in Washington in 1937 . All the time he was talking to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " his wife , Mrs. Esther Chambers , who unannounced had been testifying before the grand jury . A reporter walked to the other end of the hall and observed a woman leaving the grand jury room . She walked down a flight of stairs instead of taking the elevator , while the interview was in progress . Henry Julian Wadleigh , former State Department economist named by Mr. Chambers as a source of classified material , said that he was answering more questions before the grand jury than he did last week before the House Committee . At that time he fell back on his constitutional prerogatives in refusing to answer virtually ' all the questions asked him . Isaac Don Levine , editor of Plain Talk magazine , appeared briefly *in the corridor outside the grand jury room . He went away without testifying he said , because of the many witnesses waiting to be questioned . Mr. Levine has testified before the House Committee that he arranged the ChambersBerle conference after failing in attempts to obtain a direct hearing by President Roosevelt for Mr. Chambers . It could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioning . Other Witnesses Heard New witnesses heard by the grand jury , in addition to Mrs. Chambers , were said to be Philip Reno and his brother , Franklin Reno . Philip Reno was said to be a former employe of the Social Security Board . Their connection with the case was not disclosed . Yesterday 's session , which closed at 6 P. M. , was the longest in the eighteen-month tenure of the body , the date of whose legal demise was still not settled last night . It was sworn in June 16 , 1947 , and the. , law makes no provision for its ex tension beyond a year and a half . Thomas J. Donegan , special assistant to the Attorney General in charge of presentation of the case , said " we do n't know yet whether this grand jury will be sitting Thursday . " It will sit today , beginning at 10 A. M. , he said , adding in response to questions that ' " it is quite possible new witnesses will be heard . " A new grand jury is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take up the old inquiry if the business of the present panel is unfinished or to start a succeeding investigation of subversive activities .
