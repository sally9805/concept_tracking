At Monroeville , a whistle stop on Indiana 's frozen countryside , a bonfire crackled and popped . The celebrating went on until 3 a.m . At Portland , two counties away , the townspeople snake-danced around another bonfire . It was the same way at Crawfordsville and Jasper . All Indiana seemed to be aglow . Indiana 's 37th annual high-school basketball tourney was on . <P> The natives called it " Hoosier hysteria " or " Hoosier hoopla . " All but three of Indiana 's 782 public high schools-from little Raub High ( student body : 18 ) to Indianapolis ' Arsenal Tech ( student body : 4,578 ) - were entered . The grown-ups took it more seriously than the kids . Farmers stopped working . Storekeepers closed up shop and went gallivanting off to watch their local heroes perform . Indiana 's excitement was matched in Illinois , Wisconsin and Minnesota , where other state tourneys are in progress . In the Midwest last week it was easy to prove that basketball , the poor boy 's game , plays to larger crowds than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year 's tourney in Indiana alone ) . <P> The Sweet 16 . Last week , only 16 teams-known by Hoosiers as " the sweet 16 " - were left . Then it was their turn to battle it out in the semifinals . Monroeville , accompanied by the prayers of the home folks , went down to Muncie and got smeared , 49 to 38 . There was sorrow among Monroeville 's 896 citizens . Portland High fared better , getting by Chester Township , a hotbed of basketball on the Eel River in Wabash County , only to be humbled later in the day . In last week 's semifinals , all the small-town schools ( the smaller the town , the higher the fervor ) were eliminated . It was enough to quench bonfire celebrations all over the rural districts , where farm boys spent most of their spare time , between milking and other chores , shooting basketballs through hoops on the barns . <P> The frenzy narrowed to four schools : Evansville , Muncie , Lafayette and Anderson . " The fieldhouse four , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the finale in Butler University Fieldhouse . Despite the size of the gym ( capacity : 15,028 ) , not a ticket could be bought . Sponsors guessed that they could easily sell another 50,000 tickets . There was little or no ticket-scalping , because as one Hoosier put it : " It 's just like selling your auto . Where 're you going to get another ? " <P> Thirty Broadcasts . When the big hour arrives , 30-odd Indiana radio stations will describe every play to stay-at-homes in every corner of Indiana . The only calm &; collected people in the house will be college coaches from such faraway places as North Carolina State and Tulane , in town to size up prospects . Indiana is a prize marketplace for basketball players .
