THE YOGI AND THE COMMISSAR-Arthur Koestler-Macmillan ( $2.50 ) . <P> Hungarian-born Arthur Koestler , once a Communist and still a Socialist , wears what he calls an Old School tie that is " one of the most distinguished . . . of the good old Continent . " In Germany , the Old School was named Dachau and Buchenwald ; in Spain , it was Seville ( Koestler was imprisoned there for three months , under sentence of death ) . There was also France 's Le Vernet , Italy 's Civitavecchia prison . Inmates who have been lucky enough to escape death in the Old School now wear a tie that is patterned of scars , ulcers , and a chronic condition of shakes and terror . " I dream , " writes Koestler , that " I am being murdered in some kind of thicket . . . ; there is a busy road at no more than ten yards distance ; I scream for help , but nobody hears me . . . . " <P> Unlike most of his fellow alumni , Arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures of contemporary life , his screams into some of the best of contemporary writing . His brush with death in Spain and France , plus his disillusioning lessons as a revolutionary , gave him the material for such bleak disquisitions as Dialogue with Death , Scum of the Earth , Arrival and Departure , and also for one of the finest novels of the past decade , Darkness at Noon ( TIME , May 26 , 1941 ) . <P> Since 1940 , Author Koestler has lived in England , serving as a private in the British Army and as an official propagandist . He has taken to the English language more ably than any foster-writer since Joseph Conrad . <P> Individualism v. Economic Law . The title of The Yogi and the Commissar , a collection of 16 essays , mostly on writing and politics , fits the book like a glove . For Koestler believes that every thinking man today is threatened or tempted by these two polar figures . On the extreme Left stands the Commissar-the superbly disciplined Communist who believes that the end justifies the means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all irrational sentiments for a ruthless " pseudo-Communism " based on economic laws . On the extreme Right , in an " exotic hermitage , " stands ( or sits ) the Yogi . He believes that " each individual is alone , but attached to Truth by an invisible umbilical cord " which must never be snapped by violent movement . The Yogi is convinced that a better world can be obtained only by spiritual means , not by legislation , " that the End is unpredictable and that the Means alone count . " <P> Between these two figures stands the bewildered man of today . The intelligentsia , who might point a way for him , are either equally confused or deliberately blind . The blind , Koestler believes , are chiefly those who continue to put their faith in the creed of the Commissar . <P> The Creed of the Commissar . In a confused and confusing era of human life , the Commissar offers a doctrine that is completely " reasonable . " In place of the doubts and contradictions of contemporary science and religion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally , after a century of Utopian hopes , he offers the liberal " a real country , with real people-a glorious Russian compensation for a life of frustration . "
