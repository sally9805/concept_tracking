" The new theatrical season , " wrote the New York Star 's new drama critic last week , " got tangled in the starting gate Tuesday night , and all bets are temporarily off . " That sounded more like a sport-writer than a play reviewer-and it was , sure enough . The reviewer , who got off to a somewhat better start than Sundown Beach ( see THEATER ) , was John Lardner , 36 , chipperest off the old block of all the late great Humorist Ringgold Wilmer Lardner 's four sons . <P> He had cubbed for his new job on the Star by pinch-hitting for ailing Wolcott Gibbs in the New Yorker last season . But Lardner 's friends wondered how he would find time to cover his new beat . Although he considers himself a free-lance writer , at least four employers consider that they hold a proprietary interest in him . He is a staff contributor ( of a sport column ) to Newsweek , a staff writer on the New Yorker , a contributor on the new National Guardian ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sport columnist for North American Newspaper Alliance . ( Newsweek felt a little queasy about his new left-liberal connections , but apparently hoped that its readers would not notice . ) <P> In His Steps . Strapping John Lardner was born on Chicago 's South Side while his father was a sportwriter on the old Chicago Examiner . Of the Lardner boys , * only John has followed in his father 's sport steps . He also seems to have inherited his father 's ear for speech and tongue for humor . After a year at Harvard , he went to work on the Paris Herald , then spent three years on its parent paper in Manhattan , under City Editor Stanley Walker . He married the boss 's secretary , Hazel Cannan , and became a sportwriter , and later war correspondent , for N.A.N.A . and Newsweek . <P> Percentage Player . The John Lardners and their three children winter in Greenwich Village , summer on Fire Island , two hours away . A good drinking companion and quiet , deadpan humorist , Lardner is a cautious horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " match game " at Jack Bleeck 's newspaper saloon . <P> Last week , introducing his friend to Star readers , Broadway Pressagent Richard Maney wrote : " Lardner will introduce at least one revolutionary note into dramatic criticism . He 'll back his opinions with cash . Do you think that Boston has more people than Baltimore . . . that Bill Terry never hit .400 ? If you do it will cost you money to talk to Lardner . It 's neither ballast nor diaries which bulge his jerkin . They 're loose-leaf ledgers tabulating his daily speculations .
