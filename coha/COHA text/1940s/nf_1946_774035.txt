txt // sheep . As yet the supply of breeding stock in the United States is small , which has tended to restrict the spread of the breed . As a farm sheep under western conditions the Corriedale is well adapted and should prove popular for that purpose . Columbia. ? The Columbia is one of the newer breeds developed by the Bureau of Animal Industry , U. S. Department of Agriculture . In describing this breed Mr. J. M. Cooper of the Bureau states that the development work was begun at Laramie , Wyoming , and since 1917 has been continued at the United States Sheep Experiment Station , Dubois , Idaho . The purpose of this work was to develop a crossbred sheep , suitable to western range conditions , that would breed true // to type . Work was begun on this problem in 1912 , using Lincoln , Leicester , Cotswold , and Romney rams and Rambouillet ewes . After careful study of the type and production of these various crosses , the Lincoln-Rambouillet was retained for further development and the others discarded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the introduction of new blood lines . Most of the Columbias in the Bureau of Animal Industry flock trace back to a single outstanding Lincoln ram . Rigid culling has been practiced each year , eliminating all individuals that " throw back " to either of the original parent types , or show any other undesirable characteristics . // With only eighteen years ' development Columbia breedtype is not absolutely fixed , but variation is becoming less each year . The Columbia is a large , vigorous , heavy-boned animal , standing on rather long legs . As would be expected , it does not show quite the quality to be found in some of the older established breeds . Ewes average about 135 pounds and rams up to 275 pounds under normal range conditions . Columbia ewes are very prolific and also consistently yield long-stapled fleeces of quarter-blood ( 48 's and 50 's ) , quality . During a 3-year period the fleece weights of mature Columbia ewes , under strictly range conditions , averaged 11.27 pounds . For the same period the average percentage of lambs produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ averaged 78.02 pounds in weight at weaning time . CHAPTER IV TYPE OF SHEEP ALTHOUGH farm sheep production in certain irrigated sections of the West is making rapid growth it still remains separate from , and secondary to , that type of sheep management which we may refer to as range production . There is no doubt some overlapping between these two types of western sheep industry , but in general the methods of management for the two are quite dissimilar . In spite of the magnitude of the range sheep industry , there is probably no greater number of factors producing profit or loss in it than in the case of farm sheep production . At the present time surveys are being conducted in certain range areas to determine the exact methods of management followed by range sheep operators . These surveys deal with such problems as financing , size of sheep inventory , cost of labor , and details of the operations in connection with the handling of sheep . In this book these various operations in connection with range sheep production will be discussed . The range sheep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lambs ? from grade flocks of what are usually designated as range ewes . Sheep production of this kind is not handicapped because of the remoteness of the grazing lands from populous areas . Wool can readily be transported to a railroad without spoilage and at a low cost ; and the lamb crop can be moved to a shipping point with little loss . Range sheep are handled in bands of from one to two thousand and the man who has charge of these bands is re-43 // ferred to as a herder rather than as a shepherd . The herder 's equipment consists of a sheep wagon containing the necessary equipment and supplies . A camp tender who locates the grazing ground ahead and moves camp for the herder and himself , assists the herder . During the year sheep are run on two different kinds of range ? the winter range , which is in the lower altitudes , where there is not much snow , and the summer range , which is in the mountains and sometimes in the forest areas . The winter range must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cared for when storms occur and be fed hay or other feed while the range is covered with snow . When starting in the sheep business , it is important to realize that it is a highly specialized branch of the livestock industry . The beginner will do well to learn the business gradually rather than to become heavily involved before acquiring a knowledge of the principles of sheep management . In general , the factors in successful sheep production are very much the same in all parts of the West . Selecting Range Sheep. ? The beginner should depend entirely upon sales of wool and market lambs for his income . The production and sale of breeding stock can come later , as it represents a specialized branch of the industry . The best foundation for commercial sheep production will consist of grade ewes carrying a goodly proportion of the blood of some breed adapted to the needs of local conditions and markets . In the West the Hampshire , Rambouillet , Suffolk , Corriedale , Romney , or a long-wool breed are most popular . Uniformity in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wool and lambs sell higher . From a carcass standpoint the ewes should be of good size , with straight backs , deep , strong heart-girth , short necks , and welldeveloped hindquarters . Old ewes lose their teeth and are then unable to consume sufficient feed to maintain either themselves or their lambs . The most desirable age is the yearling , bought // in the summer of the year following its birth . The yearling is old enough to breed and is sufficiently developed so that its outcome can be rather accurately predicted . A fleece uniform in length , covering all parts of the body , free from black fibers , and with considerable density , is desirable . Western ewes purchased at livestock market centers during late summer are usually free from internal parasites . A detailed account of the parasites which affect sheep will be found in another chapter of this book . Ewes that are of breeding age when purchased should not be exceedingly fat . The fat ewe older than a yearling is usually one that has not dropped a lamb the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The teats and udders should be in good condition . Careless shearers sometimes mutilate these parts . Purebred ewes are expensive to practice with , and sales of breeding stock would in any event not be practical until such problems as breedtype , extreme development of the young stock , fitting , and salesmanship are thoroughly mastered . Handling grade sheep will give a beginner this experience at less cost . The qualifications for the range ewe do not differ greatly from those of the sheep intended for farm use , in that youth , vigor , size , and a sound mouth are prime requisites . In addition it is essential that the flocking instinct be present . This instinct is inherited from Merino breeding and a sheep that lacks it is not desirable on the range . Considerably more attention is paid to the wool characteristics of range sheep than is given to the mutton type sheep of the farming areas , particularly from the standpoint of fineness , staple , and density of fiber . An open-fleeced range sheep is more susceptible to moisture and consequently to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year in the range country . The foundation breeding of most range bands is , no doubt , fine wool . To this foundation has been added Ram46 TYPE OF SHEEP bouillet , some long-wool such as Lincoln or Cotswold , and an occasional cross of Hampshire , Corriedale , or Romney . The breed of ram which is used varies somewhat with the market demands . When lambs are high in price , Hampshires , Suffolks , and other of the down breeds are quite generally used so that a more marketable type of lamb will be produced . When fine-wool is high in price , rams of Rambouillet breeding receive the greatest call . Since the spread in selling price between lambs of Rambouillet and other breeding is usually small , and since wool has always been a major product in range sheep production , there is no doubt that a considerably greater number of rams of Rambouillet breeding are used on the range today than of other breeds . The large operator generally buys his rams in carload lots from a range producer of purebred sheep . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completeness of wool covering , and a fleece with as much density , length and uniformity of fiber as he can find . It is through careful and frequent culling of the ewe flock , and through the use of good rams , that progress in sheep breeding is made . In selecting rams the recognition of serious faults is as important a consideration as the ability to pick out individuals with outstanding good points . Open shoulders , crooked legs , weak pasterns , low backs , shallow heart-girth and narrow bodies are to be avoided . Some of these defects are common ones in sheep , and are therefore likely to crop out in the offspring even when guarded against in the parents . A ram must give evidence of vigor . A general air of alertness , a masculine appearance about the head and the possession of both testicles are external signs of vigor . An overshot jaw , sometimes called " parrot-mouth , " is undesirable since the teeth of the upper and lower jaws do not then come together . This defect is hereditary . Sheep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is less common but just as serious a defect . // Size of Ewes. ? The conditions under which range sheep must subsist are rigorous . There is a natural tendency for succeeding generations to become smaller , owing to severe climatic conditions and a frequent sparseness of feed . It is desirable to select ewes that are large and thrifty in order to offset this tendency toward smallness . That the larger ewe is desirable does not , perhaps , require argument . An experiment at the Montana Station 1 indicates the value of size in range ewes . Data on four lamb crops from 333 ewes are reported . The summary is reproduced here . There is a strikingly uniform tendency for the heavier ewes to produce more lamb . Those weighing less than 100 pounds produce an average of 21 pounds less lamb per year than those weighing 130 pounds or over . The percentage of pairs of twins raised as well as the average weight of the pairs was higher also for the heavier ewes . In order to be assured that the differences were not due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers of twin lambs // raised by the heavier ewes , the weights of all lambs were calculated to uniform age and to the basis of single lambs . On this basis the differences were as clean cut as those shown in the preceding table . It seems justifiable to conclude that the larger ewes tend to raise heavier lambs . Lambs vs . Wool. ? It is understood that range sheep pro-duction is a two-crop operation , namely lambs and wool . The resume of breeds in Chapter III has indicated that some types of sheep are distinctly desirable from a meat standpoint but often somewhat inferior as wool producers . Other types are bred mainly for wool and are not so excellent as mutton sheep . This divergence in type affords the sheepman an opportunity to lean toward either extreme ? mutton or wool ? in the selec-tion of breeding stock . For years past the typical range breeding-ewe has inclined toward the wool side . She has been // white-faced and none too thickly fleshed but a good yielder of half-blood wool . Rambouillet rams and an occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ancestry of the typical range ewe . There has been an infusion of blackface breeding into some bands , usually of Hampshire , and more rarely of Suffolk breeding . The black-face cross is not advantageous from standpoints of density of fleece , or uniformity of appearance among the lamb crop . It does , however , result in a somewhat superior kind of feeder or market lamb . Lambs sired by good Hampshire rams make more rapid gains and are thought to enjoy an advantage in price on the feeder-lamb market . Because the black-faced breeds are more open fleeced than the fine-wool , and not so strong in the flocking tendency , the retention of ewe lambs from Hampshire , Suffolk , or Shropshire rams crossed on range ewes is not usual . Generally both ewe and wether lambs from such breeding are sent to market . The operator must then buy replacements for his ewe bands from year to year , rather than replace from the ewe end of his lamb crop . The producer of these replacements may be expected to gain some profit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the raising of those replacements would be . In that event the lambs from black-faced sires must sufficiently outsell lambs from fine-wool sires not only to pay the extra replacement charge but to yield more profit also . The author can not make a recommendation as to the breed of rams generally best suited for use on average range ewes . Local conditions greatly influence the situation . Some experimental work on this point is being conducted at present , and no doubt more will follow , as the consideration is an important one . The Wyoming Station has just begun an experiment ( 1929 ) in which five lots of range ewes are to be bred successively for five years to registered Rambouillet , Hampshire , // Southdown , Corriedale , and Lincoln rams . The wether lambs are to be studied from standpoints of birth weight , rapidity of gains , economy of gains , market price , and net return . The ewe lambs are to be retained in the flock for studies on fleece , from a standpoint of suitability for ewe-replacement purposes . The California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southdown , Shropshire , Hampshire , Suffolk , Romney , and Rambouillet rams are being bred to purebred , unregistered Rambouillet ewes . A second experiment is planned in which Southdown , Hampshire , Shropshire , and Suffolk rams will be bred to Rornney-Rambouillet crossbred ewes . This work has not progressed to a point where conclusions can be drawn . Among the data being recorded are weights and gains of lambs , market grade on foot , and a detailed slaughtering record . CHAPTER V SHEEP BREEDING THE earliest recorded attempt at livestock improvement dates back to the late eighteenth century during the lifetime of Robert Bakewell , an English farmer . Bakewell 's pioneer work with Leicester sheep from which he gave to the world the idea that selection plays an important part in livestock improvement , marks the beginning of investigation along animal breeding lines . It was Bakewell who originated the breeding rule that " like produces like , " which in the light of more recent observation has been amended to " like tends to produce like . " By this we mean that offspring tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resemble , in part or wholly , other more remote ancestors . Selection. ? In their wild state different animals are subjected to different degrees of hardship due to climate , natural enemies , and variation in food supply . Many animals in their natural habitat are unable to withstand these adverse conditions , and perish . The greater the adversity the fewer the survivors . Generally the few that survive do so because they are well equipped to meet the hardships under which they must exist . This situation has been expressed as " the survival of the most fit . " We might state it differently by saying that Nature has practiced a rigid selection which has resulted in the survival of only those animals best able to meet Nature 's requirements . This is the law of natural selection . To a certain extent , especially under conditions of range production , the law of natural selection is operating in flocks and herds today . Weaklings do not live through severe 51 // storms . Open-fleeced ewes perish before the more densely covered kind do . Wool-blind sheep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more open-faced . But natural selection is now a factor quite secondary to man-controlled selection in modern livestock production . Just as Nature has for thousands of years sorted out the kinds of animals best suited to meet her climatic and other requirements , so man today is sorting . Man 's selection is made on a basis of those animals best suited to meeting market requirements for man 's use . Purebreds. ? Purebred sheep are those whose ancestors are known and recorded in a recognized flock book and all of whom belong to the same breed . Each breed of sheep differs from all other breeds in several respects , as was shown in an earlier chapter of this book . These differences are the result of different aims or ideals which sheep breeders have . These ideals are referred to by stockmen as breed type . Breed type has been defined as " the type to which a group of breeders aspire . " Back of the breeders ' ideal is utility value , for breed type is not evolved through an ideal of beauty , but rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is generally the popular type , and this should always be true . Breeders of Rambouillets are striving for a maximum growth of fine , uniform wool on a good carcass . Breeders of Hampshires want most of all an excellent mutton carcass , with as desirable a fleece as can be obtained . Southdown breeders are mainly interested in carcass development and have paid little attention to the fleece characteristics . These differences in breed type today illustrate how sheep breeders are practicing selection among their flocks . The fact that an animal is a purebred and eligible to registry is in its favor from a breeding standpoint . Purebredness indicates a concentration of thought and effort on the part of a group of breeders toward attaining a definite goal in animal form and function . It is not , however , a guarantee that this effort has been entirely successful . Like only tends to produce like , and there // is another force working against the hereditary tendency . This contra-force is known as variation . In order to understand thoroughly the workings of heredity a study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this discussion it is sufficient to point out that heredity works on quite a definite , mathematical basis ; and that as a rule less variation occurs in offspring from pure breds than occurs in those not from purebred parents . Inbreeding. ? Inbreeding may be defined as the mating of closely related individuals , such as mother and son , father and daughter , or brother and sister . In the founding of various breeds of sheep , inbreeding has played an important part because it does tend to fix or perpetuate characteristics . Closely related individuals may carry many characteristics in common , and inbreeding results in intensification or a fixing of these characteristics . Unfortunately , undesirable as well as desirable characteristics are intensified by inbreeding , so that its use as a breeding tool is dangerous . Inbreeding is also believed to result in decreased vigor , fertility and size . The range sheepman is not , in any event , as greatly concerned over inbreeding as the purebred breeder is . Linebreeding. ? Although inbreeding may prove very disadvantageous , the mating of animals showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when individuals from entirely unrelated strains or families are mated . There are many different families within each breed . By always selecting sires from the same , or a closely related family , the family characteristics are imparted to the flock . This practice is known to stockmen as linebreeding because it follows a definite line of breeding within a breed . Although linebreeding is mainly a breeding tool of the purebred breeder , the range sheepman makes use of its benefits by using rams from the same stud-flock , or from related flocks , year after year . Linebreeding is not a panacea for breeders ' ills . When following linebreeding even greater than // ordinary care must be exerted in the selection of breeding stock . Since this method is a mild form of inbreeding , there is as much chance for intensification of faults as of desirable points in individuality , unless rigid selection of individuals is maintained . Crossbreeding. ? This is the mating of animals from two different breeds . The general uses of crossbreeding are to increase fertility , size , and constitution ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breeds , characteristics not common to both . The more notable western breeds founded through crossbreeding are the Corriedale , Panama , Columbia , and Romeldale . The first generation resulting from almost any well-planned cross is an improvement in many respects over either parent . At present ( 1930 ) large numbers of Lincoln-Rambouillet crossbred rams are being used for breeding to range ewes . These crossbred rams are larger , thicker-fleshed , heavier-boned , and carry longer-stapled fleeces than the Rambouillet ; at the same time the crossbred has a more desirable fleece than the purebred Lincoln , because it has more density and will grade up to half-blood in place of the usual quarter-blood . Although possibly an improvement as an individual , the Lincoln-Rambouillet cross is somewhat of a disappointment as a breeder . His lamb crop is very un-uniform . The lambs will range in type from the Lincoln grandparent at one extreme to the Rambouillet grandparent at the other , and in between will be every possible combination of characteristics entering into the makeup of Lincoln and Rambouillet sheep . In order to effect permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desired for retention . The fixing process is accomplished through the selection and mating together for several generations , of sheep showing these characteristics . Inbreeding the selected individuals undoubtedly hastens the fixing of type , and has been generously used in founding the so-called crossbred breeds . // Sometimes definite systems of occasional crossbreeding are followed . Some range outfits introduce long-wool blood into their bands once in five or six years , the purpose being to increase length of staple , size , bone , and vigor . After one cross of long-wool the fine-wool rams are again used for several generations . This system is actually crossbreeding followed by a grading-up process . The crossbred Lincoln-range ewes are used as the basis for grading-up toward fine-wool again . Grading-up is increasing the proportion of blood of any one breed . A Utah report ' includes a comparison of operations on two separate ranches , one of which represents crossbreeding practice , the other a use of straight fine-wool breeding . This comparison is summarized in Table IV . // In discussing Table IV the authors point out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sales of wool are greater under the fine-wool plan of breeding . The difference in net income in favor of straight fine-wool breeding is largely the result of a smaller investment in land . The attitude of the forty-nine Utah sheepmen who replied to a questionnaire pertaining to the advantages and disadvantages of crossbreeding is summed up as follows : ( 1 ) Crossbred ewes are better mothers ; ( 2 ) they are more prolific breeders ; ( 3 ) they produce lighter shrinkage wool ; ( 4 ) they produce higher percentage combing wool ; ( 5 ) they produce better mutton lambs ; ( 6 ) they are better rustlers on the range ; and ( 7 ) they are larger sheep . The disadvantages reported for crossbred ewes are : ( 1 ) They are shorter-lived than Rambouillet ewes ; ( 2 ) they lose wool on brush and do not hold fleece when past 3 years of age ; ( 3 ) crossbred ewe lambs must be sold as feeders , and ewes bought for replacement ; ( 4 ) they are more difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as hardy as finewool ewes ; ( 6 ) it is impossible to maintain standards of breeding and uniform wool grades with crossbred ewes ; ( 7 ) annual losses are greater with crossbred than with fine-wool ewes ; ( 8 ) wool grading is necessary ; ( 9 ) crossbreds are harder on the range grasses than Merino or Rambouillet ewes ; ( 10 ) fleeces are too loose and too light in weight ; and ( 11 ) less wool is produced than with fine-wool ewes . The Breeding Season. ? Under eastern or farm conditions of sheep raising it is planned to breed ewes as early as possible in order to place the lamb crop on a market most advantageously the following spring . Since most ewes will take a ram as soon as nights begin to be cool in the fall , such lambs , allowing a gestation period of 146 days , would come in late January , February , or March . Producers of hot-house or Easter lambs breed as early as June , using Dorset ewes or ewes of Merino breeding . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions . On the range , lambs must come at a time when they can thrive with little or no shelter after the first few days of life , and when spring feed is becoming abundant . May lambing is most usual , although a few bands lamb as early as March , relying upon the extra weight of lamb to compensate for the cost of extra feed and shelter require ments . October and November are the breeding months on the range . At this season of the year range ewes are gen erally in good breeding condition . During the summer pasture months they will have picked up in flesh preparatory to entering the winter . It is while in good physical condition , and while gaining slightly in weight , that ewes are most easily gotten in lamb . It is believed that ewes gaining in condition will come in heat more readily and are more apt to become pregnant at the first service . Under farm conditions of man agement this belief has led to the practice of flushing . Flush ing consists of increasing the feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some green or succulent feed . If green feed is not available , a quarter to a half pound of grain per head daily in addition to pasture is considered efficient . Flushing is said to increase the percentage of lambs . Care of Rams. ? The number of ewes per ram varies con siderably. . b. ( ( bout three rams for every hundred ewes , under range breeding conditions is generally satisfactory . Range rams are run in bands separate from the ewes ex cept during the breeding season , which permits conditioning them before the season starts so as to insure their vigor and activity during breeding . In computing operating costs the item of ram service is frequently neglected as being too small for consideration . In a Wyoming survey of sheep ranching 2 ram service was figured at 44 cents per eweand was arrived at as follows : // The average purchase price of rams was $28.60 . After three years ' use the rams had a value of $10.60 . Death loss was 12 per cent and pelt value $1.60 each . Carrying cost per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2.64 , leaving a net ram cost of $13.38 . A ram was used to breed to an average of 30.2 ewes , making the cost per ewe 44 cents . It is essential to profit that all of the ewes be bred . Painting the breasts of the rams when they are turned with the ewe bands will mark the ewes served , so that an indication is had of those bred . The time between heat periods in sheep is twenty-one days . By changing the color of paint every three weeks some check can be made on the number of ewes coming back for service , or not bred during the first heat period . During the breeding season range bucks may be cut out at night for grain feeding , or different groups of bucks may be alternated between breeding and rest periods . One group may be left with the ewes for from one to two days while another group is receiving rest and grain . Winter Feeding. ? In most sections of the range country sheep producers aim to utilize winter range for their feeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow-covered , or weather conditions are too severe to permit the range to be used , supplemental feed must be given . Considerable quantities of alfalfa hay are used for this purpose in sections where it is available at reasonable cost . Shelled corn and cottonseed cake are favorite concentrate supplements . The relative merits of these two concentrates are a constant source of argument among range sheep men . Each feed has its ardent supporters . The only gage of adequate feed is the condition of the ewes . They should be gaining in weight during pregnancy to insure their own thrift and the proper development of the unborn lambs . The choice of supplementary feeds depends much upon individual preference // and upon economy . A preliminary trial comparing shelled corn or cottonseed meal , fed with alfalfa or native hay , was run at the University of Wyoming the winter of 1925-26 . The results of this trial are not conclusive . The number of ewes per lot ( 15 ) was small , many of the ewes were too brokenmouthed to utilize grain , and only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summary of this 150 ? day preliminary trial is included in Table V. Cottonseed meal proved to be more profitable than shelled corn as a supplement to either alfalfa or native hay for winter maintenance under the conditions of this trial . A combination of native hay and cottonseed meal proved most efficient , due in part to the greater average weight of lambs raised , but largely to the cheaper cost of the ration . Range grasses are more comparable with native hay than with alfalfa . From the results of this preliminary trial we might , therefore , be inclined to favor cottonseed meal in preference to shelled corn as a supplement to range pasture . In any event further work is essential before definite conclusions are arrived at . Success in sheep production , range or farm , is to a considerable extent due to the condition of the ewes at lambing time . Though a very fat ewe may have difficulty in lambing , a very thin one will ' - Aot produce sufficient milk to rear her lamb . A description of optimum condition of fatness is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should weigh from 10 to 20 pounds more at lambing time than they did the previous fall . This takes into account their wool growth and the weight of the lambs they are carrying . An average cost for winter supplemental feed is difficult to arrive at . During a winter of storms , such as occurred during 1928 ? 29 when operators spared no cost to keep their ewes alive , the cost is enormous . During open , mild winters little or no feed may be used . On a hay basis , 250 pounds per ewe is about as close to average requirement as can be arrived at . // When hay is ten dollars per ton in the stack , the average hay cost per ewe per winter would be close to $1.25. // At the Montana station an experiment was conducted in which yearling range ewes weighing a little more than 100 pounds each were fed for 112 days . One lot fed alfalfa hay alone , ate 3.3 pounds each per day and gained 12.5 pounds per head . Another lot was fed 0.75 pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weight as the ewes in the hay lot . It took 1 pound of corn to replace 3.19 pounds of hay . A third lot was fed cottonseed cake for part of the hay . One pound of cake replaced 3.27 pounds of hay . A fourth lot was fed sun-flower silage with the hay . It took 3.2 pounds of silage to replace 1 pound of hay . The use of various feeds for wintering ewes under semi-range conditions is illustrated in an Oklahoma report ' which is summarized in Table VI . // CHAPTER VI THE LAMB CROP UNDER farm sheep conditions a lamb crop of from 130 to 150 per cent is not unusual . In the range sheep business such high percentages are unheard of . In the Wyoming study of sixty-five sheep ranches the lamb crops ranged from 59 to 100 per cent with an average of 77.8 lambs per 100 ewes at docking time . Sheep are not as heavily fed in Wyoming as in some of the other western states . Some states report 100 per cent lamb crops in average years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of feed must be made . According to the Wyoming study , increasing the lamb crop from 70 per cent to 80 per cent reduces the cost of producing lamb by one dollar per hundredweight , in addition to a reduction of 3 cents per pound in the cost of producing the wool . Stating it another way , an operator can afford to spend an additional 65 cents per head each year on his ewes if doing so will increase his lamb crop 10 per cent . Lambing Sheds. ? There are various systems of handling the band during lambing . We suggest here a system of lambing sheds used by King Brothers , Laramie , Wyo. , which are the result of some thirty years ' experience with this operation . The length of the sheds will depend on the size of the band , but the width of the sheds should not be changed from the dimension suggested . This allows the man who is adding to his flocks to build on at the end of the sheds with the least possible expense and inconvenience . i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An Economic Study of Range . Sheep . Wyo . Exp . Sta . Bul. 156 . July , 1927. 63 // The night-dropping shed can best be explained if we assume that the sheep are on their way into quarters during the lambing season . The ewes that are most likely to drop lambs this particular night are lagging behind in the band . If the shed is empty the band can be brought in at either end . If lambing has been in progress for some time the band should be brought in so that the last ewes to come in are near the lambing pens . This saves carrying lambs or ewes any great distance to pen them up . Down the center of the shed is a row of posts spaced 16 feet apart . Two gates are hinged on each post , which permits dividing the center section of the shed up into almost any number or size of holding pens . Suppose that a ewe is lambing in the holding pen ( marked I ) . The night man promptly places her in the lambing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 feet long by 3 feet 6 inches deep . The front is a gate permanently hinged to the posts , but the two sides and back are a two-panel removable jiMMEIMIMEMM // hurdle ( marked A and B ) . Here the ewe 's udder is shorn , the new lamb is made to suckle , and weaklings are sent to the hospital shed for special attention . Each ewe and her lamb are branded with an identical mark , both in the same locality , so that the mothers of lost lambs can be identified at a glance . The next morning , the band , except those that have lambed , is driven out to range . The new lambs and their ewes are taken from the lambing pens ( II ) and placed in the retention pens ( III ) where they remain for three days . Each retention pen will care for twelve ewes and their lambs . As nearly as possible all lambs born the same night are placed in the same or adjoining retention pens , the date is recorded , and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three days without going into several different retention pens . For example , last night 's drop will all be in pen III this morning , tonight 's drop will all go in pen IV tomorrow morning , etc . The day drop is cared for in a slightly different way . The band is taken where pasture is good , whether far or near , and as ewes lamb they are placed in a drop wagon with their lambs . The drop wagon contains ten or more compartments , // and when all are full it is driven to the day nursery and dis charged . Any wagon with good gears can readily be con verted into a drop wagon . The day nursery is diagrammed in Figure 20 . It consists of a shed with practically the entire front of glass , pens 3 feet 6 inches by 4 feet , feeding alley , and feeding racks . The ewes and lambs are taken from the day nursery into sheds with larger compartments and retained until they are old enough to join the band . Open-Range Lambing. ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open-range method , except that corrals rather than day nurseries are used . Night lambCARE // ing occurs in the night-corral . New-born lambs are placed with their mothers in small individual pens in an adjacent corral until they become acquainted . Ewes that have not lambed are moved off each morning to graze . If they lamb during the day use is made of drop wagons . The very young lambs and their mothers are at first kept in small groups so that danger of separation is lessened . Gradually the small groups are thrown together until there are two to three thousand head in a band . When a ewe will not own and suckle her lamb special measures are necessary , otherwise the lamb will die and the ewe may develop serious udder trouble . Penning ewe and lamb together and smearing the lamb with its mother 's milk are usual methods of encouraging adoption . Under strictly range conditions the usual precautions , taken by the farm shepherd at lambing time , are not closely adhered to . Consequently only the more hardy lambs survive the range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are observed , a greater number of lambs may be saved . It seems reasonable that considerable time and effort spent in caring for the new lambs might be well compensated for in a higher percentage lamb crop . Care of the Lamb. ? It is best not to bother the ewe during lambing unless it is apparent that she requires assistance . It is often necessary to help ewes with their first lambs by pulling as the ewe strains . If the lamb has assumed an abnormal position , the hand may be inserted into the vagina for the purpose of straightening it out . Care must be taken that the fingernails are short and the hand and arm well lubricated with medicated vaseline or raw linseed oil . As soon as the lamb is born the ewe will begin licking it . As she identifies her lamb by sense of smell , this licking is very essential . A ewe that does not lick her lamb can be encouraged to do so by sprinkling salt over it . Wiping the nostrils and mouth of the lamb to remove mucus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artificial heat should be provided to thoroughly dry and warm the lamb . Different shepherds recommend different devices for this purpose . A barrel half filled with straw or shavings , covered with a sack , and containing a jug of hot water , will hold heat and has the advantage of keeping the lambs out of drafts . A chilled lamb whose life the shepherd despairs of saving , will often revive if immersed , all but its head , in water as hot as the hand can stand . When removed from the water , it should be rubbed briskly with a burlap bag until thoroughly dry . The lamb should suckle within a few hours of birth , and if it fails to do so the shepherd must assist it by placing the teat in its mouth . Warm ewe 's milk gives energy and life to a new-born lamb . Some ewes seem to lack the maternal instinct and will not own their lambs . Usually confining ewe and lamb together in a small pen , smearing the ewe 's nose and the lamb with the ewe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suckle several times a day will cause the ewe to own her lamb . Care of the Ewe. ? The mother requires some attention also . The fetal membranes or after-birth should be delivered within a few hours . Care must be taken that the ewe does not become constipated . If her bowel action is not normal , castor oil in doses of three to four ounces should be administered . Ewes in high condition are apt to give a heavier milk flow than the Iamb can care for for a few days . This is especially true if they have only one lamb . Milking out the udder and careful observation for temperature or hardness of udder are precautions . Garget is an udder infection which may be transmitted through the flock ; therefore ewes with inflamed udders should be isolated . The most effective treatment for udder disturbances is the hot application . In severe cases of garget a Preicenitz dressing should be used . This dressing consists of four layers , one each of cotton , oilcloth , wool , and burlap , and is triangular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a strong cord tied to each corner . The burlap or // sacking forms the outside , the cotton dipped in hot water goes next to the udder . The oilcloth and wool retain the heat . Two of the strings pass around the belly , the third up between the hind legs , and all three are tied over the back . " Water often but not much feed , " is a good rule to follow relative to the ewe for a few days after lambing . A little bran or oil meal and plenty of bright alfalfa hay are best . Ideavy feeding stimulates a milk flow before the lamb can take care of it , leading to udder troubles and lamb scours . After three to five days increase the grain gradually , adding oats and corn or barley to the bran or oil meal . Watch the condition of the ewes and regulate the amount of grain to keep them from getting thin . A good mother is like a dairy cow , and during the lactation period will produce milk at the ex pense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ill health , which is reflected in the condition of both her fleece and her lamb . In general , a half to a pound of grain and three to four pounds of legume hay , or legume hay and silage , is suffi cient at this time . When pasture arrives , little or no addi tional feed is required by the ewes . Bum Lambs. ? Twin lambs and orphan lambs are a con siderable problem under range systems of management . It seems doubtful if the effort and expense necessary to rear these , so-called , bum lambs by hand is justifiable . Individual feed ing by hand with high-priced labor is prohibitive . The Utah station 2 recommends an orphan feeder that has been success-fully used by a breeder of Rambouillets in that state . Cows ' milk , preferably fresh and heated to blood temperature , is used . Until three weeks of age each lamb receives one-half pint of milk four times daily . From three weeks to two months of age the ration is gradaully increased to a pint at each feeding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grain is first offered at six weeks of age and is kept contin ually before the lambs . At two months the milk ration is // changed to one quart night and morning . The grain ration may consist of equal parts of rolled oats and wheat bran , or two parts of bran to one of ground corn or barley . The feeder described in the Utah circular is diagrammed in Figure 21 . It consists of a set of stanchions attached to a frame for holding the feeding dishes . These dishes are the ordinary two-quart granite-ware basins and are held in holes cut in a board . The holes are cut to fit the sloping sides of the dishes . The top of the basins , as shown in Figure 6 , stand 13 inches above the ground . The board holding the basins is removable , which increases the ease of cleaning . The dishes and board are removed and washed after each feeding . Each stanchion of the set consists of a 1 X 4 inch rigid support ( a ) followed by two 1 X @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be removed as more room is needed for the lamb 's head . Next comes a 3-inch space ( d ) which is governed by a 1 X 3 inch movable strip ( e ) spaced 2 inches from the beginning of the next stanchion . All movable strips ( e ) are fastened to a sliding bar ( f ) which opens and closes the whole set at once . They are attached to the sliding bar by removable pegs which make possible the inserting or releasing of any one lamb 's head without disturbing the others . The various holes in bar ( f ) make individual adjustment easy . The 1 X 11/2 inch removable strips aid in making the proper adjustment as the Iambs grow and need more room for their heads . By removing one of these strips at a time and using one or the other of the holes at the top and bottom of the movable strips ( e ) , it is possible to adjust the stanchions to fit lambs of almost any size . A lamb may be taught to drink milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole has been cut , the other end being forced into a pan of milk . The report concludes by stating : Mr. Hansen has raised orphan lambs for many years , though the losses have always been high and the time required in feeding has // // been almost prohibitive . Prior to this year he estimates that fully 50 per cent of the orphans put on feed have died . This year a total of 62 lambs were put on feed and of this number all but 7 were raised successfully . The growth of the hand-fed lambs this year has also been very satisfactory . On August 16 the average weight of representative lambs from the mother-fed group was 80 pounds a head , whereas that of the hand-fed lambs weighed on the same day was 70 pounds . Docking and Castration. ? These operations are generally performed simultaneously on range lambs . Most range lambs are docked and , if males , are castrated , although danger to docked lambs from screw worms in the very arid Southwest may excuse the neglect of docking in that section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producer is to realize the greatest profit . Lambs left entire are heavy shouldered , yield a lower quality of meat , and lack the uniform covering of flesh found in wether lambs . Castration is simple and no harm results if sanitary measures are observed . An assistant grasps the lamb 's two left legs in his left hand , the two right legs in his right hand , lifts the lamb breast high , and holds him there for the operation . The operator cuts off about a third of the scrotum with a sharp knife , then pulls out the testicles . Whether the testicles are pulled out with forceps , thumb and finger , or some other means is a question much discussed by shepherds . After the testicles are pulled out and the spermatic cord broken , a mild antiseptic wash is applied to the wound . Docking is done at the same time as castration and both sexes are docked . Docking is the removal of the tail about an inch from the body . The tail is a collecting place for burrs , dung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lamb , retards its growth , and causes it to sell lower on the market . Docking pincers heated to a dull red , or a knife , are commonly in use . The pincers sear the severed arteries and stop bleeding , but such wounds require longer to heal . // Occasionally a lamb docked with the knife will bleed to death . Severe cases of bleeding can be stopped by tying a cord around the stump of the tail . The Texas station reports in a comparison of the knife with the hot iron , that : 1 . The results obtained in docking two hundred lambs indicated that there is no advantage to be gained in docking young lambs with the hot iron or docking pincers . This operation can be performed more quickly with the knife , and apparently with no great danger of fatalities due to excessive bleeding . 2 . The lambs docked with the sharp knife healed one week sooner than those docked with the hot iron . 3 . In practically every instance the knife left a healthier , cleaner wound or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering was incurred when lambs were docked with the sharp knife . 5 . The lambs docked with the knife made a slightly larger gain throughout the test than did those docked with the hot iron . 6 . No advantage was gained by searing the artery after docking with the knife . 7 . The castration of male lambs at the time of docking revealed that this operation does not hinder development , since the wether lambs showed a greater gain than did the ewe lambs . Docking and castration can be performed any time after lambs are a week old , depending upon the convenience of other factors . An experienced marker and trimmer can dock and castrate several hundred lambs in a day 's work . The lambs are caught and held by three or four assistants each of whom sets lambs on a high bench before the men who perform the operations . Jones , J. M. , and Hubbard , C. M. The Searing Iron vs. the Knife . Texas Agr . Exp . Sta . Bul. 262 . April , 1920 . CHAPTER VII SHEARING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized business . Every flock owner in the farming areas is generally his own shearer , but in the western system of sheep management shearing is done almost entirely by professionals who migrate northward from the Southwest as shearing progresses . Shearing. ? The time at which the wool crop is removed from range sheep varies with the climate . In the Southwest where both sheep and wool crop may suffer from heat two annual shearings are often made . Farther north , in the mountains of Colorado , Wyoming , and Montana , shearing comes in late May or early June . Removing fleeces as long as there is danger of late spring storms involves risk of heavy sheep losses . Leaving the fleeces on after the coming of warm weather causes deterioration in , and loss of part of the wool . Extra weight of wool , caused by additional sweat from leaving the fleeces on until late , is obtained only through a sacrifice of weight and health in the sheep . Machine shears have largely taken the place of hand shears , or " blades , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power-equipped , each shearer taking his power from a shaft running through the shed . The diagram ( Figure 22 ) shows a layout for a permanent shearing plant . Blade shearers tie their own fleeces and keep count of the number of sheep shorn by checking the number of tyingstrings used . Power shearers do not tie their fleeces . Sheep 74 // are counted into the catching pens for each shearer and are again counted in the tally pens after the fleeces are removed . The numbers shorn by a competent shearer will average about one hundred and fifty head , although it is reported that over three hundred head have been shorn by one man in a working day . The charge for shearing varies from 12 to 15 cents per head plus meals for the shearer . In addition twine and sacks must be provided by the owner , bringing the total shearing cost to something near 25 cents per head . Machine shearers vary somewhat in their shearing methods . A common procedure is to start at the brisket and shear the belly with horizontal strokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; lay sheep on its side , shearing with long strokes from neck to shoulder ; shear right side of neck , shoulder and foreleg ; and finish up fleece remaining on left side by gradually raising the sheep on its rump . As soon as the fleece is off , the sheep are shoved backward through double-swinging doors , into retaining pens . Here they are marked with the owner 's brand . In branding it is highly desirable to use a paint that will scour out of the wool readily at the mills . Branding paint that does not scour out with ordi nary scouring solutions must be removed by cutting , as its presence in a fabric causes flaws . At the same time the paint must be sufficiently permanent to last throughout the year . From tests run at the Wyoming station , l the following con clusions are drawn : Brands remain longer on the wool of the down and fine-wool breeds than on long-wools , although the fineness of wool does not affect the scouring qualities of paint . Of the pre-pared paints tested , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A paint made of lamp black , or Venetian red , mixed with linseed oil was more durable than any of the prepared paints tested , but would not scour . // Methods of handling fleeces and wool after shearing will be discussed in detail in a later section of this book . Dipping : There are a number of external parasites and disease germs affecting sheep that can be removed and de stroyed only by dipping . A description of the ailments caused by these parasites will be discussed in a chapter on sheep diseases . A description of dipping equipment and of various dips and disinfectants will be introduced at this point . A system of corrals and gates is essential to efficient opera tion of a dipping plant , as well as for handling bands of sheep at other times . One arrangement is shown in Figure 23 . The outlet from the corrals into the dipping vat should face away from the sun , and the chute should be so arranged that the sheep move slightly up-grade . This makes for greater facility in handling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dodge gates , as many " cuts " may be made as desired with only one drive through the chutes . The dipping vat illustrated in Figure 24 is standard and requires no special explanation of its use . It is a type recom mended by the U. S. Bureau of Animal Industry . The double gate in the draining pen is an admirable feature as it // allows one penful to drain while the other is being dipped , saving both time and dip . Some large sheep outfits use a spray system of dipping in preference to the vat . Spray dipping is accomplished by driving bunches of sheep into an open-topped , concrete room , on the inside walls and the top of which are arranged a series of spray nozzles . These nozzles are connected up with pipes through which the dip is forced under pressure , filling the entire room with a mist of spray . Drains conduct the used dip back into vats where it is strained for re-use . Since the first dipping is generally performed immediately after shearing , and the second dipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into wool is required . Dips. ? Different dips are recommended for various ailments . The more common dips will be mentioned here , and their general uses indicated . The quantity of dip in a vat must be sufficient to permit complete immersion of the sheep , and extra dip for replacing that carried out of the vat by the sheep must be at hand . A newly shorn sheep will carry from one to two quarts of dip out of the vat in its fleece . Some of this will drain back into the vat but fully half of it will not be returned . No matter what dip is used it should be thoroughly mixed to afford uniformity throughout the vat . Dips are most effective when soft or rain water is used , the water in every event being heated before it is placed in the vat . When only hard water is available , it should be softened by using from one to four pounds of sal soda for each one hundred gallons of water . Losses from dipping are small if care is observed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handling than to the direct effects of the dip . Dipping late in the day when nights are cold , or immediately after a long drive while sheep are hot may result in pneumonia or , at least , colds . Sheep should not be roughly handled in the corrals and legging pens , nor in getting them to enter the vat. // There are many different kinds of dip on the market . Each has advantages for a particular usage . Dips may be divided into five groups , as follows : Arsenical Cresol Coal-Tar Lime-Sulphur Nicotine Arsenical Dips. ? This type of dip is efficacious for sheep ticks and other external parasites . Probably the best known commercial arsenical dip is Cooper 's , which has been used by sheepmen for many years . The biggest objections to arsenic dips are their poisonous properties and their drying effect upon the skin and wool , tending to produce harshness . Sheep may be poisoned by licking themselves after dipping or by grazing over pasture upon which excess dip has dripped from their wool . Any dip remaining after dipping must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ livestock . An accepted formula for arsenic dip is : The ingredients are boiled for ten minutes to make a dip . Cresol Dips. ? Cresol is known on the market under a vari ety of names , such as cresylic acid , liquid carbolic , and tri cresol . It resembles pure carbolic acid in odor , varies in color from light straw to dark red , and is highly corrosive . Cresol dips consist of a mixture of cresol and soap which when diluted ready for use should contain one-half of one per cent of cresylic acid . There is no known field method for determining the percentage of cresylic acid in a dip , so that after the dip has been used for a while its exact cresylic acid content is not known . Since the active principle of dips deteriorates // rapidly with use , lack of a satisfactory field test for strength is a decided disadvantage . The U. S. Bureau of Animal Industry conducted a test2 with a vat containing sixty gallons of diluted cresol dip , one part to one hundred of water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dipping four groups of lambs and analyzed with the following results : Cresol is not readily soluble in water and is therefore com-pounded with soap solutions to overcome the lack of solubility . There are many mixtures of cresol with soap on the market under a variety of trade names . The best are compounded with linseed oil-potash , or linseed oil-soda , soap . The usual strength of a compound solution of cresol for dipping is a solution of from 2 to 3 per cent . The advantages and disadvantages of a compound solution of cresol have been enumerated as follows : Advantages : 1 . Weight for weight it is much more efficient and cheaper than pure carbolic acid . It is very readily soluble . 3 . Its soapy character permits good contact with greasy surfaces . Disadvantages : It does not mix with hard water . It is poisonous , though much less so than carbolic acid . // Coal-Tar Dips. ? The emulsified coal-tar disinfectants are found widely distributed on the market and are sold under a great variety of trade names . They are prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acids with soap . The product as purchased is a very dark , thick fluid , which should be of uniform consistency throughout . When mixed with water a milky emulsion is formed . The disinfecting power of the products on the market varies greatly . There is no trustworthy method of determining their relative value by chemical analysis ; therefore a method of comparing them by tests on typhoid-fever germs has been worked out . The power of carbolic acid to kill these germs under certain conditions is worked out in the laboratory , and after tests of the emulsified coal-tar disinfectants have been made under the same conditions their disinfecting power is expressed in the form of a comparison with carbolic acid . This is called the " carbolic-acid coefficient . " If the coal-tar disinfectant is five times as effective as carbolic acid it is said to have a caroblic acid coefficient of 5 . As a matter of fact , some of these preparations have a coefficient of only 0.5 , while others have a coefficient of 20 . The user of these products will do well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In general , these emulsified coal-tar disinfectants have the same uses and properties as carbolic acid and compound solution of cresol , though they are less poisonous than either . Most of them may be used in a strength of 11/2 or 2 per cent . These dips , when diluted for use , should contain not less than 1 per cent by weight of coal-tar oils and cresylic acid . In cold weather the constituents of the undiluted coal-tar dips may separate ; therefore care is advised in seeing that the dip is not separated at the time it is used . Lime-Sulphur Dips. ? Lime-and-sulphur dip mixes properly with water of any degree of hardness , an advantage which some other dips do not have . It is said to be injurious to wool // especially if not carefully mixed , but this objection can not hold if sheep are clipped immediately after shearing . Wool damage is generally due to an excess of lime in the dip . FIG. 25. -A Sheep Dipping Vat in Operation . // Formulas recommended for the making of lime-sulphur dip vary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series of studies conducted by the Bureau of Animal Industry 4 and the recommendations are as given out by the Bureau . The formula may be termed the " 8-18-10 " formula ; that is , 8 pounds of high grade commercial quicklime , 18 pounds fine sulphur ( either flowers or flour ) , with somewhat more than 10 gallons of water , boiled to a volume of 10 gallons at the finish . The time of actual boiling should be one hour . The theoretical ratio between lime and sulphur will be met by this formula if the lime is 98.3 per cent pure ; therefore the formula as given is appropriate for preparing a solution for dipping sheep where any chance of an excess of line must be avoided . If commercial hydrated ( not air-slaked ) lime is used the amount should be increased nearly one-third , say to 10.5 pounds . The finished solution , drawn off from the sediment , should theoretically contain 18 per cent of sulphid sulphur , but probably will contain somewhat less . It is , therefore , appropriate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centrate to 9 or 10 volumes of water . Nicotine Dips. ? The nicotine dips are sold under various trade names , and the flock owners are more or less familiar with them from use in dipping for scabies . When used in 0.07 of 1 per cent solution they will eradicate sheep ticks , if two dippings are given with an interval of 24 to 28 days between dippings . A field test has been designed by one of the large manufacturers of nicotine dips whereby the percentage of nico tine in the dip may be ascertained at the vat side at any time . These dips should be used in accordance with the instructions printed on the label of the container . Nicotine is frequently used with sulphur in the treatment of sheep scab . The nicotine-sulphur dip is made with sufficient // nicotine solution and flowers of sulphur to give a mixture containing not less than 0.05 of 1 per cent nicotine and 2 per cent sulphur . Sufficient nicotine for 96 gallons ( about 800 pounds ) of dip would therefore be furnished by 1 pound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this dip would be : Nicotine , 0.4 pound ; flowers of sulphur , 16 pounds ; water , 96 gallons . In preparing this dip the nicotine solution and sulphur should be mixed together with water before adding them to the water in the dipping vat . The dip should on no account be heated above 110 ? F. after the nicotine solution is added , because heat is liable to evaporate the nicotine and weaken the dip . So far as efficiency is concerned this dip ranks about with lime-sulphur , except that with nicotine there can be no injury to the wool other than a slight discoloration . The chief objection to nicotine dips is their sometime nauseating effects on both the sheep and the attendants around the vat . CHAPTER VIII GRAZING AND LAND RANGE sheep production is based upon utilization of the natural range grasses and shrubs . It can be accurately , and browse , it should not be inferred that they are in any sense scavengers , nor that they can thrive without being allowed a full complement of food supply . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a very important factor in the range livestock business . Herbage. ? It is not essential that the sheep operator be a botanist . It is desirable , however , that he have some knowledge of the important grazing plants which make pasturage on the western plain and mountain areas . In the areas mentioned there are literally thousands of species and varieties of native grazing plants . The more important of these are the wheat grasses , Agropyrons , which are high in palatability and nutritiousness ; the grama grasses , Bouteloua , either annual or perennial ; the bromes , Bromus , of which there are both native and introduced varieties ; the redtop-timothy family , Agrostis ; buffalo grass , Bulbilis ; the fescues , Festuca ; rye grass , Elymus ; and the reed grasses , Calamagrostis . Of the more than thirty known varieties of wheat grasses about twenty occur in the western states . They are perennials , erect , simple stemmed , and often with bearded terminal spikes . Western , bluestem and slender are the best known species . The gramas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forage over most of the Great Plains region . The three most important species are blue , hairy , and black . The gramas grow as rough sod in the North and as isolated tufts in the South . Buffalo grass is a highly important pasturage plant in much of this area , as are the native bromes . Little attempt at improvement of the native grasses has been made , nor have efforts been made to introduce such plants as the clovers , or blue grass except in hay meadows . No doubt the time is near when discriminating studies relat ing to species and varieties of native forage will be begun . Mention has previously been made ( Chapter I ) of state and railroad lands granted in the early development of the West . It is said 1 that approximately 195,536,000 acres , or about one-sixth the total area of the seventeen western states , is unreserved and unappropriated public domain . It now ( 1930 ) seems probable that much of t ? ; s land will revert to the states in which it lies , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or only surface rights will go to the various states . Leases. ? Klemmedson states 1 that the approximately 202 , - 762,000 acres of leased grazing land in the seventeen western states are owned as follows : Table Some interesting facts relative to public and leased lands are included in Table VII from the above report . There can be little doubt that public lands and most leased acreages do not receive the care given to owned lands . In the case of public lands there is no control at all over grazing . // First come is first served , with a resulting depletion of grass and the replacing of original species with others of low feeding value . Where overgrazing has become serious it is too late to bring back desirable species of grass by deferred or rotation grazing . Reseeding alone , a slow process at best , can eventually replace depleted grass lands , but not as long as the lands remain a part of the public domain . Investment in Land. ? Whether owning or leasing land is apt to result in greater profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land prices . According to a Wyoming survey , ' as the percentage of investment in sheep increased the return on total investment also increased . It is recommended that , under present conditions , an operator should have from 45 to 70 per cent of his total capital in90 GRAZING AND LAND vested in sheep . Above 70 per cent the operation becomes quite speculative , as little range will be controlled and losses during years of drought and severe winters will be greater . An investment of less than 45 per cent indicates too low a percentage of capital invested in sheep , the thing which yields the actual returns . The results of the survey show that if the wool grower owns his range he may have about 43 per cent of his total capital in sheep , 10 per cent in improvements and equipment , 2 per cent in feed and supplies , 1 per cent in horses , and the remaining 43 per cent in land . According to the Wyoming study , the larger the percentage of capital in land the less the chance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? No grazing area can be well and efficiently used unless ample stock-watering facilities are available . Sheep require less frequent watering than cattle , especially if grazing upon succulent herbage . The daily requirements of a sheep vary from a half to one and a half gallons per day , depending upon the dryness of the forage and the temperature . Control of watering places is one of the first essentials in locating for sheep ranching . These watering facilities may be natural , such as streams or springs , or they may be constructed wells with reservoirs or other means of storage . Springs. ? Springs that run full early in a season can be made useful during the entire grazing period by being dug out and improved . The construction of concrete curbing for confining the flow of springs and an arrangement of log or other kinds of troughs is an aid to complete utilization of springwatering facilities . Storage. ? Reservoirs can be readily constructed for the gathering and holding of early season surplus water , which is used later when the water supply is short . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks . Their construction is so simple and their use so general in the range country that further discussion seems unnecessary . // Wells. ? The cost of drilling wells varies from a few dollars to several hundreds , depending upon the region where drilled . Windmills or engine-driven pumps are used to supply the storage tanks , and it is customary to have always in the tanks an emergency supply for case of accident to pump or power . Troughs. ? Watering troughs for sheep may be of concrete , metal or wood . Metal troughs are light , convenient to ship and store and are not excessive in cost . The wooden trough deteriorates rather rapidly but the first cost is less . Concrete troughs are probably cheapest where sand or gravel are read-ily available , but they have the disadvantage of being difficult to move from one location to another . // THE NATIONAL FORESTS In 1891 Congress authorized President Harrison to set aside certain areas as " Forest Reserves " in order to protect remaining timber from destruction and insure a regular flow of water in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the National Forests was passed by Congress in 1897 and placed the forests ' administration under the Secretary of the Interior . In 1905 the administration was transferred to the Forestry Division of the Department of Agriculture , later becoming the Forest Service . In 1907 the original " Forest Reserves " were officially re-named " National Forests " to indicate that the forests were for present as well as future use . Under acts of 1911 and 1924 the Government may purchase lands valuable for the protection of headwaters of streams and for timber growing , organize them as forests , and add them to the National Forest system . The National Forest area now includes over a million and a half acres of land valued in the neighborhood of two billion dollars . Many of these lands furnish summer pasture for western livestock . Table VIII lists the numbers of animals grazed on the national forests during 1928 . During 1928 there were fewer cattle grazed on all the forests , but an increase of 7,200 head of sheep . The gain in sheep was heaviest in Montana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  During the earlier . years of the Forest Service administration it was thought that the grazing of livestock on the Forests was detrimental to timber production . This belief was mainly due to the unsatisfactory results then obtained by uncontrolled grazing in the European forests . When the national forests were established , there were already many stockmen residing close to , or within , the forest boundaries who had been accustomed to making use of these areas for summer pasture . There arose serious protests from these people over the exclusion of livestock from forest grazing // // privileges . Accordingly , a federal investigation was made which resulted in 1897 in the establishment of a grazing policy . This policy still holds . The following excerpts from the Forest Service Regulations ( 1928 ) give an idea of the policies being followed : Authorization . Reg . G-1 . The Secretary of Agriculture in his discretion will authorize the grazing of livestock upon the national forests under such rules and regulations as he may establish . The Forester will prescribe the number and class of stock to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorized by the Secretary . Applications and Permits . Reg . G-2 . Every person must submit an application and secure a permit in accordance with these regulations before his stock can be allowed to graze on a national forest , except as hereinafter provided and unless otherwise authorized by the Secretary of Agriculture . The Forester may authorize the issuance of grazing permits for a term of years within a maximum of 10 years . A term permit shall have the full force and effect of a contract between the United States and the permittee . It shall not be reduced or modified except as may be specifically provided for in the permit itself and shall not be revoked or canceled except for violation of its terms or by mutual agreement . The grazing regulations shall be considered as a part of every permit . The few head of livestock in actual use by prospectors , campers , and travelers , or used in connection with permitted operations on a national forest , or not to exceed 10 head of milch , work , or other animals owned and used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contiguous to a national forest may be allowed to graze free , under such restrictions as the Forester may prescribe . All stock grazed under paid permit on national forests must be actually owned by the permittee . Private Graving Lands TVithin National Forests . Reg . G-4 . Persons who own or have leased unfenced lands within any national forest , and who agree that the United States shall have exclusive possession of such lands , may secure permits allowing them th graze upon national forest land free of charge the number of stock which the private lands will support , provided such an exchange will not // be disadvantageous to the Government . Such permits will be subject to the same restrictions regarding the use of the range as permits issued under other regulations . Preferences . Reg . G-7 . For the purpose of contributing to the stability of the livestock industry and making the forage resources , of the national forests of the greatest value , the Forester shall provide for the recognition of preferences in the use of national forest ranges and the renewing of permits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with the principle of a reasonable distribution of grazing privileges . Persons who are full citizens of the United States shall be given preference in the use of national forest ranges over other persons . The following classification of applicants for grazing privileges is hereby established : Class A. Persons owning and residing upon improved ranch property which is dependent upon the national forest , and who are owners of not more than the established exemption limit number of stock , or the protective limit number in the absence of an exemption limit . Class B. Prior users of national forest range who do not own improved ranch property , and persons owning such property who own stock in excess of the established exemption limit , or the protective limit in the absence of an exemption limit . Class C. Persons who are not regular users of national forest range and who do not own improved ranch property . This class can not acquire an established preference in the use of national forest range . Permits to Purchasers . Reg . G-9 . To facilitate legitimate business transactions , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or limited by the Secretary of Agriculture , and upon satisfactory evidence being submitted that the sale is bona fide , a purchaser of either the permitted stock or the dependent , commensurate ranch property of an established permittee will be allowed a renewal of permit in whole or in part , subject to the maximum limit restrictions , provided the purchaser of stock only actually owns dependent , commensurate ranch property , and the person from whom the purchase is made waives to the Government his preference for renewal of permit . A renewal of permit on // account of purchase from a grantee who has used the range less than three years will not be allowed . A grazing preference is not a property right . Permits are granted only for the exclusive use and benefit of the persons to whom they are issued and will be forfeited if sold or transferred in any manner for a valuable consideration . Grazing Fees . Reg . G-10 . A fee will be charged for the grazing of all livestock on natural forests , except as provided by regulation , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cases where the Forester may determine it is to the interest of the United States to permit free grazing . The Forester is authorized to determine the fair compensation to be charged for the grazing of livestock on the national forests , upon the basis of the following factors : ( 1 ) A proper use of the grazing resource to best serve the public interest . ( 2 ) Reasonable consideration of the value of the forage to the livestock industry . ( 3 ) Effect of the rates upon the livestock producers . An additional charge of 2 cents per head will be made for sheep or goats which are allowed to enter the national forests for the purpose of lambing or kidding . No charge will be made for animals under six months of age at the time of entering the forest , which are the natural increase of stock upon which fees are paid or for those born during the season for which the permit is allowed . Range Management . Reg . G-12 . Under the Forester 's general instructions , the forests will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock to be grazed in each district determined , grazing seasons established , the entrance of stock regulated , range divisions between permittees made , and efficient methods of range use developed and applied with a view to the most equitable and profitable utilization of the forage consistent with its sustained productivity and with the protection of the forest and other related interests . Handling of Stock . Reg . G-13 . Forest officers shall require methods of handling stock on the national forests designated to secure proper protection of the resources thereon and dependent in THE // terests , and may require the owners of livestock to give good and sufficient bond to insure payment for all damage sustained by the Government through violation of the regulations or the terms of the permit . Damage to Improvements . Reg . G-17 . The owners of all stock grazed on or allowed to cross any national forest must repair damage caused by their stock to roads , trail , springs , or other improvements . Failure to make prompt and adequate repairs , particularly after repeated notice , is sufficient grounds for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole or in part . Cooperation with Stockmen . Reg . G-18 . In order to secure a collective expression of the needs of persons holding grazing permits on national forests , or portions thereof , and to afford them a reasonable opportunity to share in the administration of grazing and secure joint action on the part of permittees , the Forester will provide for recognition of and cooperation with State and local livestock associations under the provisions of Regulations A-9 . Whenever a national livestock association appoints an advisory board or committee representing users of the national forests in all of the different States , it will be recognized by the Forester and consulted annually regarding matters which concern the use of national forest range . Revocation of Permits and Preferences . Reg . G-19 . The Forester may authorize the revocation of grazing permits to preferences in whole or in part for a clearly established violation of the terms of the permit , the regulations upon which it is based , or the instructions of forest officers issued thereunder . The rates on the various national forests vary somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors which determine rates are water facilities , type and extent of forage , accessibility , topography , prevalence of poisonous plants and predatory animals , fire hazard , and improvements . As a general rule , the measure of carrying capacity of a range or forest is the number of animal months of feed available during a normal year when utilized to the extent that from 10 to 25 per cent of the herbaceous vegetation is left at the end of the season and approximately 25 per cent of // the palatable species , evenly distributed over the area , is allowed to reach seed maturity . On range where the carrying capacity is unknown , estimates are made . The first step is to divide the range available for each class of stock , make estimates for each class of stock , and then make separate estimates for each division of the range , based on some similar range . In a few years sufficient data are gathered to tell the actual carrying capacity . This capacity varies with seasons , but an average is taken , and increases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed for fire protection or there is an increase in forage which is reasonably certain to be permanent . Organization of Forest Service. ? The Forest Service comprises a group of highly trained , intelligent men . The forest officers are , for the most part , university graduates in forestry , with special additional training along specialized lines . An esprit de corps similar to that existing among army officers is found in the Forest Service and the result is an efficient , able personnel . The national forests are administered by a Forester and his associate . The Forester is directly responsible to the Secretary of Agriculture . There are assistant foresters for the various administrative offices such as lands , operation , forest management , range management , engineering , finance and accounts , public relations , and research . In addition there are eight National Forest Districts , each with a District Forester and a group of assistant district foresters with departments similar to those in the Forester 's office . There are 149 national forests , each with its supervisor , rangers , assistant rangers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest accomplishment of the Forest Service in connection with the grazing of livestock on the forests has been through increasing the carrying capacity . The increase has been accomplished in two ways , namely : through more complete utilization of the enTHE // tire areas ; and through increasing forage growth by deferred grazing . Much has been accomplished by the placing of salting grounds . Instead of placing the salt near watering places as formerly , it is now scattered in areas heretofore neglected by the grazing livestock , thus bringing these areas under grazing . Drift fences , water developments , and the eradication of poisonous plants are other accomplishments which have bene fited grazing in the national forests . Range Management. ? The forests are divided into grazing districts , the kind and number of stock to be grazed in each district are determined , the grazing seasons are established , // the entrance of stock regulated , range divisions between permittees are made , and methods of range use developed and applied with a view to the most equitable and profitable utilization of the forage , consistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other related interests . To accomplish the objects of the range management policies outlined above , the District Forester requires the preparation of range management plans for each forest or portion thereof . Since the ranger is recognized as the officer upon whom actual range management falls chiefly , these plans are built up by the rangers , assisted by the supervisor , deputy supervisor or grazing assistant . In general , these plans take the natural division or allotment as the basis for all permanent records , annual plans and reports , and cover five-year cycles . They consist of maps , policy and objective statements , and such written material as will set forth proper range management in relation to vegetative readiness , forage growth , seasons actually used , distribution and salting of stock , deferred and rotation grazing , bedding out system of handling sheep , poisonous plant control , fire protection , degree of utilization , range improvement , etc. , and important related interests , such as forest reproduction , wild life , and recreation . The ranger 's unit-records and plans are assembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grazing objectives and policy of the forest as a whole . The forest plan must then be approved by the District Forester , and , once agreed upon , is mandatory upon the supervisor except as to minor changes to meet necessary current adjustments . No general change may be made in policy during the five-year cycle without approval of the District Forester . It should be recognized that these plans are not final , they are completed as far as knowledge at the time will permit and revised to meet changing conditions or to conform to more accurate data when collected . // Poisonous Plants. ? The location of ranges infested with poisonous plants is designated on a range map , and men in control of stock grazing on the range are informed of the location and nature of the poisonous plants when they occur in amounts sufficient to be dangerous . Some of the plants of the larger nature may be eradicated by grubbing , at reasonable expense , and many more of the smaller species may be controlled by proper seasonal use of the range . Grazing Investigations. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and practical means for conservation and use of the grazing resources of the national forests . They thus aid in the administration of the national forests and assist the permittees in handling their stock on the national forest ranges . Investigations are conducted along the following lines : 1 . Improvement of range by artificial seeding. 2 . Natural revegetation and methods of range management which will insure perpetual and maximum production of forage with a minimum loss through non-use . 3 . Distribution , life history , palatability , and economic importance of herbaceous and scrubby plants on national forest ranges , together with the development of herbaria and standardization of names of range plants . 4 . Climatic characteristics of vegetation belts on certain forests . 5 . Carrying capacity of national forest ranges . 6 . Proper seasons for grazing national forest ranges . 7 . Improved methods of handling stock under range conditions . 8 . Distribution and development of stock-watering places . 9 . Grazing in relation to tree reproduction , erosion , stream flow , fire control , wild life protection , recreational and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poisonous plants . CHAPTER IX WESTERN FARM SHEEP PRODUCTION SHEEP probably receive less thought from the man engaged in general farming than any other class of livestock . In spite of the fact that they were the first species of animal to receive consideration at the hands of livestock improvers and have always played an important role in the British system of agriculture , their popularity as a farm animal in the United States has not been overwhelming in nature . Their use has not , perhaps , been as great as the profits from intelligent farm sheep production would warrant . This may be due in part to the fact that too many farmers , if their system includes sheep at all , believe that a dozen or so ewes to keep the fence corners clean , and a mediocre buck to breed the ewes constitute sheep production . They are often ignorant of the finer technique of feeding and managing sheep , and their attitude is one of toleration , rather than pride . Sheep on a farm consume little feed and the income from wool and mutton comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmer . There is most decidedly a place for farm sheep production on the many irrigation projects and dry-farming sections which now dot the West . The general principles of sheep raising under both range and farm are similar . The details of management differ somewhat and this chapter will be devoted to pointing out some of the major differences . Selecting the Flock. ? Thirty to forty ewes can be handled on most farms and this number constitutes a unit sufficiently large to warrant proper care , and the purchase of necessary 102 // equipment . Too few ewes are more bother than benefit , and too small an investment may discourage the personal interest so essential to success . A choice of breeds is not a difficult matter . A leaning toward sheep having mutton producing ability would seem desirable , as the increase from such sheep can more readily be disposed of in farming communities . Such points as uniformity FIG. 29. -A Band Receiving Its Winter Hay Ration in a Sheltered Spot . and individual excellence are as important for the farm flock as for the range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales of breeding stock would in any event not be practical until such problems as breed-type , extreme development of the young stock , fitting , and salesmanship were thoroughly mastered . Handling a grade flock will give a beginner this experience . Selecting the Ram. ? In selecting the ram a purebred should be secured . If the ewes show evidence of the characteristics of some particular breed well adapted to local conditions , a purebred ram of this breed should be used on the ewes . The // ram should be selected with a view to correcting any common fault which the ewes show , such as small size , light bone , open fleece , or poor constitution . Purebred rams are more vigorous and will contribute more uniformity to their lambs than grade rams will . The grade buck may present a good appearance , but his germ cells are sure to carry a great variety of characters which will result in a non-uniform crop of lambs . Lambs from purebred sires are easier keepers , are ready to market earlier , make more economical gains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors favor greater profit for the producer of lambs , from purebred rams . Breeding Preparations. ? Ewes should not be bred when lambs , as their growth will be stunted . Seventeen or eighteen months of age is the proper time for the first breeding . The down breeds will usually not come in season until late summer or fall , but ewes carrying a portion of Dorset or Merino breeding will take the ram earlier . The gestation period ranges from 146 to 153 days . The ewes can be bred at such a time as to insure their lambing when the lambs are wanted . Before being bred , ewes to be eliminated from the flock should be taken out and fattened preparatory to slaughtering . Ewes that have failed to breed the previous season , poor milkers , broken or worn-mouthed ewes , or extremely aged ewes should be removed from the flock , as they are liabilities rather than assets . Care of the Ram. ? The ram will need special attention and feed during the breeding season . About a month before being turned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The amount and kind of grain will depend on the ram 's condition . If he is thin , a mixture of one part corn , three parts oats , and one part bran is good . For a ram in good field condition the corn may be omitted . Rams that are excessively fat are slow breeders , but thin rains are not sure breeders . // By leaving the ram with the ewe flock a few hours each day , then feeding him separately , he can take care of more ewes than if left with the ewes all day . A vigorous , lusty ram lamb can breed from fifteen to twenty ewes without injury , and a yearling can breed from forty to fifty if he is fed grain separately . A branding paint that will scour can be daubed on the ram 's brisket and a record of the ewes covered each day thus kept . Changing locations or color of the paint is effective in keeping track of different services , and the ewes that are not bred are also identified in this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been bred , the ram may be removed from the flock . Some flockmasters leave the // ram with the ewes after the breeding season is over , but doing so may cause him to annoy the ewes during pregnancy . Ewes should gain in weight throughout the duration of pregnancy . The successful sheepman accomplishes this gain cheaply by utilizing waste feeds about the farm . Grain stubble , corn stalks , fence rows , and unused pasture will usually furnish sufficient feed until wet winter sets in . Grazing provides the ewe with exercise which is essential to her good physical condition during this period . Winter Feeding. ? A good quality of legume hay is the basis for the ewe 's winter ration in the West . Sheep like fine hay . Cutting the hay will increase its utilization , but it is doubtful if the wastage saved will pay for the cost of cutting . The condition of the ewes must be the guide as to their feed requirements at this time . As stated before , they should be gaining in weight . The developing fetus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be putting some fat on her frame preparatory to suckling her offspring . A great variety of grain mixtures have been suggested by // different experiment stations . A few of these mixtures are included here : Linseed oil meal and bran are excellent protein feeds , but expensive . Straw provides bulk and some nutriment , but fills the fleeces with chaff and beards . The use of silage in the ewes ' winter ration is becoming more common . From 1 to 3 pounds , in addition to grain and some hay , can be fed , depending on the weight of the ewe . It is not practicable to feed from a silo for sheep alone because they will not consume the silage fast enough to keep it from spoiling in the silo . Mouldy or sour silage is very harmful to sheep . Sunflower silage is successfully used at the University of Wyoming . In general , a good winter ration for ewes in lamb might include 1/4 to 1/z pound of grain , 1 to 3 pounds of silage , and 2 to 3 pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grain need not be added to a hay and silage ration until about a month before lambing . Increasing the ration just a few days previous to lambing stimulates the milk flow too soon and is the cause of udder ailments . In root-growing sections mangels and turnips are favorite succulent feeds . They can be used to replace silage in the ration , but a liberal amount of sugar beets or mangels sometimes causes urinary calculi or stones in the sheep 's bladder and is therefore considered dangerous to use . Linseed oil meal and bran are excellent protein feeds , but expensive . Straw provides bulk and some nutriment , but fills the fleeces with chaff and beards . // Shelter. ? During the winter months sheep can have access to a dry shed or barn that provides protection from wind and wet weather . Exercise lots in connection are desirable . Warmth is not necessary until lambing time if the ewes are kept dry and out of the wind . It is not necessary to spend recklessly for livestock equipment . Economy , simplicity , durability , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are several general factors to be observed in planning a good sheep shed . Convenience of location from the standpoint of fields in which the sheep can run should be considered . Locate the building on a knoll for good drainage in all directions . Well-drained lots lessen the chance for foot diseases . Ventilation is important . Barns and sheds used for sheep quickly become filled with a strong ammonia odor , tend to sweat the sheep , and increase the chance of pneumonia unless ventilation is provided . Sheep are susceptible to drafts , so that direct ventilation is impractical . Some modification of the King ventilating system is suggested . Such a system installed in an old barn at the University of Wyoming proved to be a fine investment from the standpoint of the sheep 's health . Windows may be hinged at the bottom and closed on the sides to keep the drafts above the flock and some foul air outlets may be provided through the center of the building . As the same building will be used for wintering , lambing , and rearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommended . A floor space of 12 to 16 square feet , depending on the size of the ewes , is necessary for each sheep . If some individual sheep are better doers than others , a division of the flock on the basis of their condition is advisable . Galvanized iron wash tubs are good containers for use as water tanks . A plentiful supply of cool , fresh water is essential to the health of the ewes . Grain troughs and hay racks should be constructed so that the rubbing of wool on neck and brisket is minimized ( Figure 32 ) . // The shed or barn should be placed so that a maximum amount of sunlight is obtained . Morning sun warms the building quickly after a cold night . When the lambs come they will be found seeking the patches of sunlight for warmth . A glass-front shed in use in Wyoming is described elsewhere in this book . Ample space should be provided for feeds so that they can be purchased advantageously and stored against the months of high prices . A room with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward keeping a man near the ewes at night when lambs are coming . Lambing. ? Many novices in sheep raising fall down on the job at lambing time . The success of the entire year depends upon the care and effort expended during lambing . Signs of Approaching Lambing. ? As the paunch distends and the udder enlarges , by the behavior of the ewe the shep-herd is warned that lambing time is near . Ewes showing // these signs should be placed in pens by themselves to avoid being annoyed by the rest of the flock . At this time it is best to remove stray locks of wool and dung tags from about the hindquarters and udder . Lambs will suck these tags instead of the teats , and not only suffer from lack of nourishment , but wool-balls may form in the stomach and cause serious disturbance . Shearing around the udder in cold weather may cause garget if too much wool is removed . The shepherd must be with his ewes constantly during the lambing period to give assistance if necessary , see that the ewes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start to suckle . Developing the Lambs. ? The ailments of lambs from healthy , properly fed ewes are few . Sore eyes , scours , pinning , constipation and navel ill demand treatment . Sore eyes are common and are characterized by a milky or inflamed appearance . Frequent washing with a saturated solution of boric acid or 15 per cent solution of argyrol will clear up the eyes . Scours are due to digestive disturbance caused by giving an improper ration or spoiled feeds to the ewe . Remove the cause of the scours and the lamb will improve . A teaspoon of castor oil is sometimes beneficial . Pinning is a collection of dung under the tail which closes the anal opening . Remove the excrement . Constipation may be remedied by administering a teaspoonful of castor oil . Navel ill is an infection of the navel , usually accompanied by diarrhea and swollen knee joints . Clean quarters and bedding are a preventive ; painting the navel with tincture of iodine is the treatment . Marking ? Docking ? Castrating. ? All lambs should be marked soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearing number , year , and name or initials of the owner is practical . At the University of Wyoming , where the lamb crop is one hundred or less lambs a year , the first digit on the tag represents the year , the latter two the lamb 's // individual number . Lambs are numbered in the order of their birth ; thus lamb number 825 was the twenty-fifth lamb dropped in the spring of 1928 . A lambing record-book kept by the shepherd is essential for purebreds and desirable in any event . Each line in the book is devoted to a lamb , the headings across the top of the page reading as follows : Number , Date of Birth , Sex , Condition , Weight , Dam 's Number , Sire 's Number , Remarks . Under remarks the disposal of the lamb or his record association number may be entered . In the case of ram lambs to be used for meat , castration is necessary and should take place within a couple of weeks after birth . Castrated lambs fatten faster and produce a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation is simple and no harm results if sanitary measures are observed . An assistant grasps the lamb 's two left legs in his left hand , the two right legs in his right hand , lifts the lamb breast high , and holds him there for the operation . The operator cuts off about a third of the scrotum with a sharp knife , then pulls out the testicles . Whether the testicles are pulled out with forceps , thumb and finger , or some other means is a question much discussed by shepherds . After the testicles are pulled out and the spermatic cord broken , a mild antiseptic wash is applied to the wound . Docking is done at the same time as castrating and both sexes are docked . Docking is the removal of the tail about an inch from the body . The tail is a collecting place for burrs , dung and maggots , and as such endangers the health of the lamb , retards its growth , and makes it sell lower on the market . Docking pincers heated to a ( lull red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sear the severed arteries and stop bleeding , but such wounds require longer to heal . Occasionally a lamb docked with the knife will bleed to death . Severe eases of bleeding can be stopped by tying a cord around the stump of the tail . // Feeding. ? The method of feeding lambs from birth until weaning time depends upon many factors . Purebred lambs that are to be sold for breeding stock at comparatively higher prices must be pushed for the limit of growth almost regardless of ration cost . Early lambs for market , those born from December on , should also be developed rapidly if their owner is to derive the complete benefit of their early birth and sell them at a time when the market is usually higher , before the general run begins . Ewe lambs to be used in replacing culls from the flock should be well developed , but economy of feeding becomes a more important factor than in the case of wether lambs for market , since extreme fatness is not necessary or desirable in breeding lambs . Early lambs will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lambs , as the latter will be able to utilize pasture to a greater extent . Each owner will have to work out the system which best fits his own conditions . Regardless of the feeding objective , one condition should be insured ? a plentiful supply of mother 's milk for the lamb . As indicated earlier , the soundness of the ewe 's udder is an important item in selecting her . Ewes that reveal themselves as poor mothers , unable to nourish their lambs , should be marked for culling even though of superior individuality . The first requisite to lamb feeding , then , is an ample milkproducing ration for the mother . Market Lambs. ? In the chapter of this book devoted to marketing , a discussion of market-lamb requirements is undertaken . Fat lambs that bring highest market prices must weigh under 80 pounds . Depending somewhat upon their breeding , these farm-raised lambs will be from three to five months of age when ready to market and can be weaned at marketing time . The choice of feeds to supplement ewe 's milk will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to pick at hay in a rack when from one to two weeks old and will soon learn to eat grain . A creep // will enable the lambs to get some extra feed . A creep consists of a pen , the entrance to which is too small to admit ewes , but large enough for lambs to get through . In the pen a feed trough is placed from which the lambs can feed . It is de sirable to place a very limited amount of grain in the trough , no more than will be cleaned up in a short time . In general , ground oats , wheat bran , oil meal , and corn or barley are best suited to the lambs ' needs . Market lambs can be fed more corn or barley in proportion to the protein feeds , breeding lambs less . A market-lamb grain mixture might include two parts ground oatsone part wheat branone part oil meal , and four parts corn or barley . In addition to concentrates , some clean , bright alfalfa hay should be placed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of the fattening ration should not be neglected . Blue grass pasture is good , rye is available early and makes excellent pasture . Rape is good feed and is relished by the lambs . At the University of Wyoming oats and Colorado field peas , drilled 75 pounds and 60 pounds to the acre respectively , are cut and fed for green feed with very satisfactory results . Late lambs that can not attain market weight until late summer or early fall can be fed more economically on pasture than on concentrated feed . // Weaning. ? Lambs kept for flock replacement or sale as breeding stock should be weaned at about four months of age , or at the same time the market lambs are weaned . Most of the ewes will be ready to dry up by that time , though udders should be inspected and milked out if necessary to avoid their being spoiled . If the flock has been on pasture , turn the lambs out as usual , keeping the ewes penned up , and the weaning will be easily accomplished in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in drying up the milk flow quickly . CHAPTER X PUREBRED SHEEP PRODUCTION THE production of purebred livestock is a highly specialized branch of the livestock industry . Purebred animals to be used for breeding purposes must attain maximum development at all ages and must be of a certain desired breed type . Special knowledge of fitting , showing , and feeding are usually essential to success . To embark in the production of breeding stock without several years ' experience with less valuable animals is to court heavy financial loss . The only way of starting abruptly in the purebred sheep business , with-115 // out previous experience , is to hire competent , experienced shepherds and managers . This method is usually not practicable unless the business is to be launched on a rather extensive scale . Special Considerations. ? Nearly everything that has been said in this book relative to the care , feeding , and management of sheep applies to the production of stock for breeding purposes . The system of management followed more nearly resembles that discussed in the chapter on farm sheep production , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are included . Only additional special phases will be considered at this point . Each breed of sheep differs from all other breeds in several respects , as was shown in an earlier chapter . These differences are the result of different aims or ideals which sheep breeders have . These ideals are referred to by stockmen as breed type . Breeders of Rambouillets are striving for a maximum growth of fine , uniform wool on a good carcass . Breeders of Iiampshires want most of all an excellent mutton carcass , with as desirable a fleece as can be obtained . Southdown breeders are mainly interested in carcass development and pay little attention to the fleece characteristics . In any event , a perfect and detailed knowledge of breed type for the breed selected is essential to the breeder of purebreds . All animals are born with certain definite characteristics for size , thrift , color , disposition , and hundreds of other things definitely represented in their germ cells . Since we can not see the germ cells , we must depend upon external , visible body characteristics to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Germ cell representation alone is not sufficient . Environment , or feed and care , is equally important in determining what an animal develops into . That is why breeding stock must receive the best of care and feed . Without favorable environment a breeder of sheep can not know whether a sheep carries desirable or undesirable features in // its germ cells . We want to use only the desirable in our breeding operations and therefore extra good management is essential for the determination of which animals are of the desirable type . Even those animals carrying desirable individuality will not always breed true . In order to maintain a uniform type , it is necessary to understand not only the judging of sheep , but the mating of sheep . This involves a knowledge of the history of the breed , where the breed originated , from what kinds of sheep , what families or strains within the breed have been prepotent , the weaknesses and strong points of the important families , the intelligent reading of pedigrees , and some understanding of the principles of animal breeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production of purebred than commercial sheep , it is obvious that greater financial returns must be expected . Part of these returns will // come from greater value per head of stock , but a larger lamb crop than is obtained under range sheep conditions is absolutely essential . A crop of 140 to 150 per cent is attainable with proper management . Selling . The more successful breeders of purebred sheep follow a definite system of advertising as an aid to profitable disposal of breeding stock . Market animals can always be disposed of by shipment to central or other markets . Owing to the extra cost of producing breeding stock , it can not , in general , be profitably disposed of through the regular market channels . Sales are made at the ranch , at a fair or show , or through mail orders . This kind of selling involves special salesmanship . If a breed popular locally has been selected , surplus breeding stock may be disposed of in surrounding territory . Advertising. ? It has been said that there are four steps which enter into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described as ( 1 ) arousing interest , ( 2 ) inspiring confidence , ( 3 ) the awakening of desire , and ( 4 ) the ability to close the sale . Much advertising copy is aimed at accomplishing more than one of these steps . In fact almost any national advertising campaign is no doubt initiated with an expectation of accomplishing all four of the steps . In the livestock business advertising in periodicals can at least be used to arouse the interest of potential purchasers . A breeder 's card carried regularly in periodicals representing the livestock industry , should familiarize many possible buyers with the availability of that breeder 's livestock . The breeder who does no advertising of some sort is unheard of outside of his own immediate community . Confidence. ? The livestock industry is founded on honesty and integrity . Organizations whose business it is to record purebred animals must take the breeder 's word for much of the required information . The matter of ages , sire , dam , and color markings are recorded just as furnished by the breeder , // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very much in the minority , as the progress made in livestock breeding demonstrates . Such progress could not occur were many breeding records falsified . A breeder can inspire confidence by gaining a reputation for strict honesty , and by making it apparent that he knows his business . Desire. ? One may desire that which is better than he possesses . By demonstrating the ownership of superior sheep , a breeder can awaken a desire among other breeders and range buyers for his animals . Although show-ring winnings are not direct proof of breeding ability , sheep that win at livestock exhibitions are apt to be superior breeding animals . Show winnings are certainly direct proof of individual excellence , and as such are a major point in awakening a desire on the part of others to buy . Closing. ? Perhaps the most difficult step in selling is to close the deal . A campaign of advertising through periodicals and show-ring , and the acquisition of a reputation for fair dealing and ability to produce good stock , will bring in inquiries for livestock . An inquiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on price . The seller may feel that his advertising campaign has been too costly , and may make an effort to get back his expenditures for this purpose too quickly . He may price his rams and ewes too far above the prices of other breeders . Experience and close touch with the business alone can teach the seller what he should expect to receive in the way of prices . Sometimes a complete turnover of surplus stock at lower prices is more profitable than selling a few head at long prices and the balance very cheaply . Price is not the only consideration in closing a sale . A purchaser will often be willing to pay more if a suitable guarantee accompanies the animal .
