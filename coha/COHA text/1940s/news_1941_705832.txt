Most theories of money fail to account for public psychology . If the public thinks our money is sound , then it does not matter how unsound it is theoretically , it is sound as fax as you and I are concerned . If borrowing and printing are so sue . cessful , why should we pay any taxes at all , except those that keep us from getting afraid of the dollar ? If we tax luxuries and excess profits sufficiently to keep prices from rising , we can go on borrowing forever . Taxation for so-. cial reform , such as social security and unemployment relief , and high individual income-tax rates to curb war prof-. iteers should keep us complacent about the future of our dollar . The Treasury now has the equivalent of a cube of gold thirty-three feet on . edge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As long as they are kept in. the Treasury showcase , we do n't need to count the billions that go for defense. , Why not double the pay of the Army to make it more attractive ?
