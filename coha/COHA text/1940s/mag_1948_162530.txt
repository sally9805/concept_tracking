( See Cover ) <P> The President rested last week out on the end of a long limb of land-at Key West , Fla . Resting there with him was his counsel and legal adviser , Clark Clifford . While Clifford beamed on his smiling boss , Mr. Truman turned a tanned and apparently carefree face toward the photographers ; Clifford himself glistened with confidence and sunburn oil . Looking at the two of them , no one would suspect the gravity of the problems which arrived daily in the pouch from , Washington . No one would suspect , in fact , that the country appeared to be getting ready to dump the whole Truman Administration. * <P> The bad news was spread bluntly in every newspaper . But if this dismayed the men around the President they , like him , gave no sign but went on smiling-hoping , as they had so often hoped before , that something would turn up . <P> Back in Washington something had indeed turned up . But it was hardly reassuring . At C.I.O. headquarters a wan Phil Murray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were holding a conference calculated to undo the soothing effects of Mr. Truman 's vacation . They were not ready to make any public statement . But Murray and Kroll , so the Washington rumor ran , had met to devise some way by which Mr. Truman could be persuaded to withdraw as a candidate for re-election - and consider whom they could get to run on the Democratic ticket instead . <P> " He Do n't Do Well . " Their decision was first to bring pressure on the Democratic bosses and convince them that the party was sure to lose with Truman . They might not need much pressure in that quarter . As for a substitute-out of their conferences came an extraordinary idea . Unembarrassed by labor 's traditional suspicion of the military or by Dwight Eisenhower 's flatly worded statement to the Republicans , they had seriously discussed the chances of getting Ike to be the Democrats ' man . As a possible running mate they had turned hopeful eyes on Supreme Court Justice William Douglas . The story was another indication of the new low point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so low ? At a time of great confusion in international affairs , Mr. Truman had often faced his responsibilities with a cheerful , dogged courage . But his performance was almost invariably awkward , uninspired and above all , mediocre . He had declined to assume real leadership . Most of the time , instead of leading , Mr. Truman had been whipped around the curves like the last car of the train . Even on an issue in which he was right with most of the country , Mr. Truman found himself in wrong with most of his fellow Democrats . The Southerners howled with rage because he proposed to assure Negroes their constitutional rights . The fellow travelers had deserted him earlier because he would not appease Soviet Russia . His " muddling through " policy on Palestine pleased no one . <P> But , worst of all , Mr. Truman was losing out where his appeal had once been strongest . The man on the street was no longer content to admire him as just another " ordinary guy . " From all over the country came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he do n't do well . "
