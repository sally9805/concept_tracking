Along Lisbon 's sunny streets last week nearly all available space was filled with election posters . One bore the likeness of Dictator Antonio de Oliveira Salazar and of President Antonio Oscar de Fragoso Carmona , a 79-year-old general and pompous figurehead . The legend on the poster was : " Dois homens uma s obra " - two men with one work . Opponents of the regime had crossed out the a in uma , which changed the meaning : two men , one goes to the bathroom . <P> This Sunday , Portugal 's " qualified " voters may , if they wish , go to the polls . Since Salazar seized power 20 years ago there have been several presidential " elections , " but this was the first in which an opposition candidate was permitted . Once a seminarist slated for the priesthood , later a university economist , devout , self-effacing Dictator Salazar believes the masses incapable of governing themselves . Every now &; then he lets the opposition show its head , to make a show of " democracy . " <P> Carmona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mattos , a retired general and diplomat who reads treatises on topography and mathematics for relaxation . He heads a forlorn rabble of socialists , democrats , Communists , and some monarchists . <P> Making the most of its brief freedom ( controls will be clamped on again after the election ) , the opposition newspaper Republica addressed the dictator thus : " Senhor Salazar , the world will not tolerate the direction in which you are walking against the will of the nation . You govern by force and you call it right . You are the only free man in Portugal . " <P> The government 's campaign for Candidate Carmona predicts civil war if Mattos should win and circulates outlandish whispering-campaign stories , one of them to the effect that Mattos once became enraged when he was thrown from a horse , and ordered the animal shot . In a village near Lisbon , a truck dropped handbills which boasted that the government had brought electricity , a school , a cemetery to the district . In his dirt-floored stone house , an old man read the handbill-by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 've never lacked space to bury our dead . "
