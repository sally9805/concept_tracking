It was just after 7 in the evening . Francisco ( " Panchito " ) Grana Garland , 45 , boss of Lima 's ultraconservative La Prensa , manager of a big pharmaceutical business , had had a long day at the office . " Good night , sonny , " he said to the porter , and headed toward his car . A moment later six shots crackled in the street . The porter got out in time to see a sedan turn the corner . Grana lay mortally wounded at the wheel of his car . <P> The murder of Editor Grana , scion of one of Lima 's 60 reigning families and bitter editorial enemy of the dominant Apra Party , touched off the biggest political crisis since the Apristas came to power two years ago . <P> Since 1945 La Prensa had stood on the editorial opinion that fanatics who had spent 16 years in illegal activity would never be fit to govern Peru . When Apra Leader Victor Raul Haya de la Torre put three Apristas in key Cabinet posts , La Prensa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of Peru 's 4.000.000 Indians . La Prensa also fought the Apra plan to get Standard Oil cash for these plans in return for oil concessions . <P> Hardly a man in Lima heard the news without thinking at once of another assassination . Eleven years earlier Antonio Miro Quesada , editor of the powerful , conservative Comercio , had been shot and killed in the Plaza San Martin . That time an Aprista had done it . <P> This time ? Published comment was guarded . Now the Apristas were not only a lawful party but Peru 's most powerful . <P> <P> And only recently , in deference to La Prensa-led opposition , they had put off the controversial oil deal till July . To place themselves beyond suspicion during the investigation , the three Apra Cabinet ministers resigned , thereby causing the Cabinet to fall . Apra 's La Tribuna offered a $3.000 reward for the murderer . <P> At week 's end President Juan Jose Luis Bustamante Rivero appointed a military Cabinet to tide over the crisis .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
