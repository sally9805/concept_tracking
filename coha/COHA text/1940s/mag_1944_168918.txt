The pea-green freshman , hitherto the lowest form of campus life , is wearing a hero 's helmet this fall . Without him there would be little or no college football - except at West Point and Annapolis . <P> Matter and Mind . Throughout the U.S. last week , college coaches sweated and swore at squads averaging 85% 18-year-old freshmen . The best they could achieve would be something less expert even than last season 's football ( with its smattering of veteran V-12s ) , but the public was not of a mood to mind : the Notre Dame-Army game was sold out nine weeks ahead of time ; advance ticket sales at Minnesota were running 40% ahead of last year . <P> All things considered , such onetime big-timers as Alabama , Tennessee and Michigan State decided it was time to resume operations after a year 's absence from the gridiron . Others , like Princeton and Carnegie Tech , figuring contrariwise , had tossed in the towel for the duration . Of the few teams already in action , Michigan 's teens rang the freshman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - to- 7 , against the strong Iowa Seahawks ( Naval Pre-Flight ) ; 6-ft. 4 Freshman End Dick Rifenburg caught passes and ran for both Michigan touchdowns . <P> French Fried Potatoes . Most coaches were too busy training their freshmen fondlings to indulge in the old practice of crying into their beer . Their apple-cheeked youngsters actually looked pretty smooth in varsity uniforms , especially when braced here &; there by veteran 4-Fers . <P> At South Bend , the well-organized luck of the Irish still held . Notre Dame was up with a new 200-lb. , 6-ft. 3 sparkplug , 17-year-old Joe Gasparella , touted to be as good a passer as Angelo Bertelli . <P> Southern California , the best bet on the West Coast , had eight lettermen from its 1944 Rose Bowl championship team . <P> Coach Henry Frnka ( rhymes with Sanka ) , who nursed Tulsa into three Bowl games ( Sun , 1942 ; Sugar , ' 43 and ' 44 ) , was not surprised to find that his gang of yearlings was big and promising . He hoped to rate a fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw away his book of intricate spinners and reverses , adopted a set of simple plays , figured he had practically the entire Big Ten to worry about - then his quarter back , ex-Marine Jack Doyle , choked on a French fried potato and cracked an injured rib . <P> Holy Cross , doped to dominate New England , was beaten by Yale last week in a practice game . <P> The Big Guns . Aloof from the yearling hurly-burly were the footballers of West Point and Annapolis . Army and Navy were loaded for bear , had almost stopped worrying about Notre Dame . <P> Lieut . Commander Oscar Hagberg , recalled from submarine duty in the Pacific , found himself tutoring one of the mightiest loads of TNT ever assembled on the banks of the Severn . His forward armor , undeniable from end to end , sparkled with two All-Americans : Don Whitmire , tackle , and Jack Martin , center . Behind the seven pillars were Hal Hamberg , Navy 's triple-threat ace of last year , and a backfieldful of ex-Alabama , North Carolina , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torpedo was Ralph Ellsworth from Texas , 9.7 man for the 100 and perhaps the best tailback in the country .
