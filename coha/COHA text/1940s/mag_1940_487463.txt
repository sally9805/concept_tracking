I FIND IT rather amusing that Henry Seidel Canby , per- haps the most dignified of our literary statesmen , considers the romance of Robert Jordan and Maria in " For Whom the Bell Tolls " one of the " perfect love stories in modern literature . " In my review of Hemingway 's book I brought in one minority report to the effect that Maria was the only unreal character in the book and that the romantic **25;305;TOOLONG was unconvincing . Maria has no organic relation to the main story ; moreover , in the course of a long book full of characters who grow as we read  --  like figures coming toward us  --  into human beings with whose personalities and fates we become almost painfully involved , there is absolutely no development in the character of Maria She is a ready-made pawn  --  symmetrical and submissive  --  whom Pilar pushes into Jordan 's sleeping bag and whose function begins and ends just there . The love scenes read as if they had come out of a tap turned on and off at will , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The love story , in other words , borders on pulp , though no pulp magazine would allow such frank descriptions as Hemingway 's to appear in its pages . That is why I find the rapture of Mr. Canby , who would not touch True Stories with a ten-foot pole , amusing . Hemingway 's treatment of women and love is ridiculous but not amusing , because the fact that Maria is a complete blank mars his book as a whole and in particular undermines the characterization of Jordan It may be objected that if Maria fails to become real , the other woman in the book , Pilar , does not . But Pilar 's reality has little to do with the fact that she is a woman . It is her masculine characteristics that predominate and make her interesting . The test of Hemingway 's capacity for creating a woman character is Maria . He fails that test and in the process reveals an attitude toward women and love compounded of adolescent naivete and what seems to be an equally adolescent , belligerent condescension toward women as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who baffle him , he forces Maria to occupy the role of a sexual convenience and at the same time contrives to put her on a pedestal . It is hard to say which is worse from the artistic point of view . Maria is sure-fire , of course , with American readers , including Mr. Canby , and her unreal presence in a book rich in other characterizations so obviously based on close and creative observation even raises the suspicion that she was deliberately invented . I should prefer , in a way , to believe that ; but I suspect that the real explanation is even less to Hemingway 's credit as a mature writer . I ca n't help feeling that Maria actually represents Mr. Hemingway 's , and Mr. Canby 's , conception of woman as she is or should be  --  which is pretty discouraging . I HAVE A MEMORANDUM from George Joel on " Oliver Wiswell , " the latest novel by Kenneth Roberts , - King of the Slicks " ( slicks are magazines printed on coated paper which pay authors a minimum of ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built up his reputation and his prosperity on sugar-coated versions of early American history which have had a tremendous popularity , has chosen this " patriotic " period , of all others , to launch a book which presents the American Revolution from the Tory point of view . Some of our more vigilant educators says Mr. Joel have banned Dr. Rugg 's books because he hints that the social and economic standards of America could stand improvement . What will they do about a book , bound to be more widely read than textbooks , which states that the only people who supported the American Revolution were " the human dregs of the country , " which labels John Hancock a smuggler and Sam Adams an embezzler and describes our forbears as " pockmarked , furtive-eyed , shambling , hoarse-voiced peasants " ? I 've come across a clue here and there that casts some doubt on the notion that the motives of the American revolutionaries were purely idealistic . It seems the colonists objected to being exploited , underpaid , underfed , badly housed . Mr. Roberts , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . They were in the main uneducated , rude , and uncouth , they had , in other words , the common faults of those who fight desperately for survival . The common people never seem to find time to learn manners , and Mr. Roberts does not like people who lack manners . I do n't like Oliver Wiswell . He is a very stuffy fellow If he were living today he would be a Union League Club Republican , and if you transplant his story to a modern setting , you have a diatribe against the democratic concept of life . That apparently is exactly what Mr. Roberts had in mind in writing " Oliver Wiswell . " He is said to be one of our most violent present-day tories , a distinction he shares with the professional patriots of the Daughters and Sons of the American Revolution . But perhaps he has outsmarted himself . He has presented the D. A. R. with a nice dilemma . The Daughters would undoubtedly agree with his opinion of the underprivileged , but they can hardly be expected to admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Roberts should have chosen another revolution . In any case it will be interesting , as Mr. Joel suggests , to watch the career of Oliver Wiswell , particularly in Hollywood . LINGUISTIC NOTE : A letter from Oslo relates that German soldiers in Norway are equipped with a German-Norwegian phrase book , edited by one Lieutenant Colonel F. Sulzberger , which contains the following sequence of questions and commands in the section designed for soldiers on duty  --  there is another section for general use Are you the mayor ( minister , teacher , manager , etc ) ? Open all the cabinets . Where is the cash ? How many crowns are there ? Write down the amount here . 610 IT SEEMS that readers are complaining about the fact that books are getting almost too heavy to hold For that reason Harper , I am informed in a publicity note , decided to issue a small thin-paper edition of " Mark Twain in Eruption " as well as the larger regular edition . This small edition , according to the release , was sold out before publication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that publishers will heed the complaints A book that is small enough to stick into a pocket , printed in good type and flexible as to cover , is ingratiating in itself , but the tendency has been all the other way . Competition for the reader 's attention has fostered sheer exhibitionism in book-making , especially in the matter of size and thickness of paper So-called " fine books " are likely these days to be big books . What is needed is well-designed small books . This is a cause that might well be taken up by the Dolphin , " a periodical for all people who find pleasure in fine books " The Dolphin was originally the annual of the Limited Editions Club . It is now to be issued as a " quadrimestrial " magazine , and I have been meaning for some time to report that I find its first issue very engaging . It is concerned only with The Book There are articles on The Printer as Author , Edward Lear ( with illustrations and quotations ) , a detective story in which the sleuth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hypnerotomachia Poliphili , " a discussion of Persian book-making , a sharp little essay on typography by George Bernard Shaw  --  he has strong opinions about that too The final item is The Purloined Letter , by Poe , here printed in a type that has never been used before The Dolphin will include such a reprint in each issue When a dozen have appeared they will be bound Into a book free of charge . But wo n't it be a big book
