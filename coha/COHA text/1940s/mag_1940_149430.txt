A baggy old man in a blue serge suit with white piping on his vest pottered out of the U. S. Senate chamber one day last week . With a long white holder and an unlighted cigaret in his hand , he emerged smiling like an imp . Through little knots of Capitol tourists he made his way under the rotunda to a small white door marked " To the Dome . " clumped down a flight of steps and along a shining corridor , entered a three-room suite which is the only Senator 's office remaining in the Capitol building itself . <P> His secretary pointed to sheaves of congratulatory telegrams piled high on the Senator 's desk . Behind the eater-cornered desk hung a framed quotation from Lincoln : I am not bound to win , but I am bound to be true . I am not bound to succeed , but I am bound to live up to what light I have . I must stand with anybody that stands right ; stand with him while he is right and part with him when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hiram Warren Johnson slicked his parted white hair and posed for photographers . Said he : " I am , as my grandmother used to say , as happy as a clam at high tide . " The happy clam had just been triple-nominated for his fifth term in the U. S. <P> Senate . He had been nominated by Republicans-who elected him twice as Governor of California , whose Vice-Presidential nomination he , unwisely , let Calvin Coolidge get in 1920 . He had also been nominated by Democrats-whose leader he supported in 1932 , whose same leader this year repudiated Hiram Johnson as no longer a liberal . He had likewise been nominated by the Progressives , last echo of the party under whose banner he and Roosevelt I tried to capture the U. S. in 1912 . In California this November , only Communists and Prohibitionists will run candidates against Hiram Johnson . <P> For this habitual tribute to a great political figure , everyone was , as usual , ready with a so-called explanation . Rush Holt said it was a victory for Isolationism . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Other Republicans found in it a happy portent for Republicanism in general , tried to get Hiram Johnson to endorse Wendell Willkie . Hiram Johnson himself said : " Of course , if they had n't agreed with my views , they would n't have voted for me . " All explainers ignored the fact that when a State once acquires a solid admiration for the gnarled-hickory character of an elder statesman it often continues to vote for him regardless of issues - as Idaho did for Borah , as Virginia has done for Glass .
