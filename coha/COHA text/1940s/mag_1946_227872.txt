Angles in Shortages Sirs : <P> Did TIME have its editorial tongue in cheek when reporting " Playing the Angles " Oct. 21 ? Are . . . readers to assume that American citizens have become so completely demoralized that they must court dishonesty in a thriving black market , must lie , cheat and connive in their frenetic clamor for meat , soap and automobiles , and disown their offspring to obtain an apartment ? . . . Not only have we an ample supply of meat , but thousands of Canadians are donating meat coupons to the Canadian Meat Board to help feed the starving Europeans . . . . I have no wish to be smug , but surely if Canada can do it the U.S. , with an even vaster supply of foodstuffs and materials , should be able to . <P> Toronto James E. Evoy <P> Icy Hold Sirs : <P> Referring to your front cover of Oct. 21- your ice man cometh , but he droppeth his ice before he arriveth , unless he reviseth the manner in which he holdeth his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He always gets there. - ED . <P> <P> Faith in Europe Sirs : <P> I am ... thoroughly disgusted over the article by Mr. Paul Hutchinson TIME , Oct. 21 . . . . I claim that Commandment No.1 is : Faith in people and their destiny . How dare Mr. Hutchinson condemn Europe 's spiritual future . . . . We are carrying on a Holy War against Communism , and how does that prove lack of religious feeling ? The reason the political parties call themselves Christian ... is that they are true Christians . The bulk of the parties is made up of conscientious religious men &; women who , through Nazi persecutions , suffered for their faith . They kept on believing , and paid for their spiritual stubbornness in concentration camps . . . . I was engaged as interpreter in your War Crimes Organization , speak five languages . . . . I used the opportunities I had to talk to the ' man in the street " in almost all the , countries west of Russia 's sphere of influence . ... I also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany . These Europeans had nothing , and their prospective material future was more than dark ; but their optimism and dignified faith was strong and unshakable . Europe is not spiritually beaten . I only wish I had the eloquence of Cicero and Shakespeare 's vocabulary to tell you why , instead of being Norwegian struggling with a foreign language . . . . <P> INGRID GRIGGS SWeetwater , Tex . <P> <P> Track Jumper Sirs : <P> In your issue of Oct. 14 you state : " After 14 years in receivership , the C.A. &; E. finally chuffed out last week . " <P> Now , gentlemen , you have often aroused my admiration for your frequently delightful choice of words , as well as for your apt new use of many an old one . I bow humbly to your practiced use of almost an industrial idiom , but , never did I expect you to jump the track when confronted with a commuter electric line like the C.A. &; E.

Do n't you agree " chuffed " just is n't the word ? <P> STEPHEN P. DAVIDSON Parkersburg , W. Va . <P> <P> Right is Reader Davidson .
