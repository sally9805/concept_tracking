A hot propaganda potato had been tossed to Secretary of State Acheson ; it was either keep it and get burned , or toss it back . He cupped it gingerly in his hands , and heaved it back . Twenty-two Soviet bloc citizens , including top Russian Composer Dmitri Shostakovich , had applied to visit the U.S. They would be chief exhibits at a " cultural and scientific conference for world peace " this week in Manhattan . <P> The Secretary of State could keep the Communists out , as the Communists had kept the Americans out of Russian territory . Or he could let them in , label them well and let them talk their heads off . He issued the visas-and a frosty statement that the U.S. " entertains no illusions as to the manner in which the Communists will attempt to use and manipulate the present conference . " <P> Apparently a few Americans still entertained some illusions . The U.S. sponsoring committee was studded with the well-intentioned , the gullible , the confused , and salted with Communists . The committee was headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red stars in his eyes . Besides such unsurprising names as Henry A. Wallace and Charles Chaplin , the roster included Physicist Albert Einstein , Novelist Thomas Mann . What was really surprising at this late date was that such supposedly well-informed people as Vassar President Sarah Gibson Blanding and Columbia Philosopher Irwin Edman had agreed to sponsor the Communists ' show and ducked out only at the last minute . <P> Whatever the Communist visitors had to say , the State Department intended to use their presence here as ammunition for the daily Voice of America broadcasts to Eastern Europe . In the case of Shostakovich , a few dreamers hoped for more sensational results : the New York musicians ' union invited the submissive Soviet composer , who works hard to keep in tune with his masters , to unpack and let " his genius flower ... in the blessed air of freedom . " No one could guess how Shostakovich really felt about the idea . By all the evidences he and the artistic high command in the Kremlin were singing in the same key again . Shostakovich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is away Moscow moviegoers are enjoying his latest score , a travesty on Yankee Doodle . Presumably the Kremlin had also taken the customary steps to persuade Shostakovich and his six junketeers that it would be best to come right home .
