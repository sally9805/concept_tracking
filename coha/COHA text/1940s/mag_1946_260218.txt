Citizens . . . you are brothers , yet God has framed you differently . Some of you have the power of command , and in the composition of these he has mingled gold . . . others he has made of silver to be auxiliaries ; others again who are to be husbandmen and craftsmen he has composed of brass and iron . . . . If the son of a gold or silver parent has an admixture of brass and iron , then nature orders a transposition of ranks and the eye of the ruler must not be pitiful toward the child because he has to descend in the scale . . . just as there may be sons of artisans who having an admixture of gold and silver in them , are raised to honor . . . . For an oracle says that when a man of brass or iron guards the State , it will be destroyed . <P> Twenty-three hundred years after Plato , educators still debated whether the golden sons of brass and iron parents have a good chance to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of research , an investigating committee last week decided that they did not . To a conference of educators at Columbia 's Teachers College , the University of Chicago 's Stephen M. Corey , head of the committee , reported : " The assumption seems to have been that ' genius will out . ' The committee believes this faith unjustified . " <P> To give genius a better chance , Professor Corey 's committee recommended that a National Commission for the Identification of Talented Youth be set up . The Commission would stage a talent hunt through every high school in the land , using tests to find the top tenth of 1% in each group ( about 2,000 in the U.S. ) . No tests now in use satisfy the committee : tests should measure not only academic aptitude , but scientific and artistic ability , and " talent for constructive social leadership , " said Dr. Corey . <P> Once the Commission had found the " top 2,000 " U.S. youths , it would broadcast their names to colleges as well as to business and industrial groups which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report met with praise , and with some apprehension . Professor Arthur T. Jersild of Teachers College liked the report 's " emphasis on . . . the many kinds of ability . . . . An I.Q. of 200 is useless if it is fettered by archaic habits of thought . " But he raised a point which had already bothered the committee , " the hazards to the individual of being singled out as an outstandingly able person , " and added a personal misgiving : " whether a roster of elite human beings . . . is wholesome and wise from a democratic point of view .
