 | You drop your great-grandmother 's Dresden cake plate just as you are taking it out of the dishpan . A day or two later you make some clumsy darns in your husband 's favorite wool socks , and you are n't so expert as usual with your lipstick . Your finger joints feel hot and stiff , and your hands look old . Fear grips you . You remember your grandfather , unable to work , unable even to hold a newspaper in his deformed hands . You remember Aunt Ida , who could scarcely hobble from bed to chair . They called their affliction rheumatism , but you know it was arthritis . All too many people , from the ape men of a million years ago to people living now , have suffered from rheumatoid arthritis . The disease is no respecter of age or sex . Octogenarians and children just learning to walk can suffer from it . It is one of the most widespread of all chronic diseases . Arthritis wo n't kill you ; but it is a crippling disease . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become bent permanently , your fingers to become knotted and useless , and so affect your mouth that you can scarcely eat . It can cause poverty , starvation , and humiliation . Today the chances are you wo n't become so crippled or malformed as your grandfather was . In the experience of good clinics , at the most 10 or 15 percent of rheumatoid arthritis cases progress to the point where the joints become rigid , and doctors think some of this might have been prevented . On the other hand , about two thirds of the patients either recover altogether or improve markedly . This is welcome news , for arthritis might afflict any of us . It is common in our climate and attacks people of any age , sex , race , or position , although it affects women more often than men , white people more often than Negroes , and the poor more often than the rich . It is easy for the average person , and sometimes for the doctor , to confuse it with other ailments . If you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wretched future when you actually ache from something entirely different . You may call any pain in the joints or extremities " arthritis , " just as your grandfather called any backache " rheumatism . " Neuritis , underfunctioning of the thyroid gland , rheumatic-fever , gout , muscular aches are only a few of the troubles we might self-diagnose as arthritis.  | There are many kinds of arthritis : the two most nnmon are rheumatoid and hypertrophic , or de ? nerative joint disease . We are concerned here with my the former , for the latter is in many respects an itirely different problem. , No one knows what causes rheumatoid arthritis , but ledical science has learned a great deal about it . u yourself know the advanced symptoms : muscle : iffness ; aching and pain ; stiffness , pain , and swellin the joints ; ultimate rigidity of the joints . The important thing to remember is that rheumatoid rthritis probably is not primarily a disease of the , ints ; it is a general systemic disease . The skin , ; uscles , nerves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joints . You usually have many of the stems of a general disease . You are quite likely to are a low-grade fever . You may suffer from palpita , n of the heart ; you frequently are dragged down v a moderate anemia ; and the sedimentation rate of le blood may be increased , often in proportion to the verity of your arthritis . If your doctor suspects arthritis early in the course f the disease , X-ray pictures will show no changes 1 your joints . That obviously is the best time to treat ie disease . Later there is general decalcification , or , ftening . There is swelling of the soft tissue around ie joints , which gets worse if the disease persists . As time goes on , there may be narrowing of the joint spaces and destruction of the cartilage . Finally the joint becomes immobile . Obviously , you should take care of your arthritis immediately . It is of prime importance to have a good doctor , interested in the patient as well as the disease ; for rheumatoid arthritis is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many theories concerning its cause are being evolved , many experiments are going on . The reliable practitioner first makes a careful diagnosis and then makes the greatest effort to understand all about the patient . Many things are thought to predispose one to arthritis . For instance , poverty , grief , and family worry seem to be so related to the onset of rheumatoid arthritis that some great clinics ask the help of psychiatrists . Indeed , many factors seem to influence the development of arthritis . You may have faulty posture because you never corrected that " debutante slouch , " with its concave chest and convex stomach , fashionable after the first world war . People who are built naturally along such faulty lines , or have acquired them from fatigue or some trouble such as a gastrointestinal ailment , seem subject to arthritis . You live in a town that is damp and cold in winter and hot and muggy in @#  | summer . That climate apparently encourages arthritis . You are underweight . You suffered from cold hands and feet and other circulatory disturbances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These , too , are predisposing causes . You have a chronic sinus infection , start to sniffle early in the winter , and never fail to succumb to one or two attacks of tonsilitis or flu . Acute infections such as influenza and focal infections such as bad sinuses , abscessed teeth or tonsils , plus generally lowered resistance may lay the groundwork for rheumatoid arthritis . Do n't suspect arthritis just because you have a couple of bouts of grippe , however , although it is never safe to submit supinely to anything that indicates a generally run-down condition . You notice arthritis in definite ways . In the more acute forms , you suffer pain in two or three joints at once ; but usually only one or two are affected at first . Most cases begin gradually . In the early stages you may have one or two attacks and then the arthritis goes away . At the first attack , make an appointment with the doctor . As the pain and stiffness get worse , you suffer most when you wake up in the morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fatigue , and activity . The pain may have little relation to the amount of swelling in your joints ; you can suffer hideously with only a little swelling . Also , you are bothered by sleeplessness , loss of appetite , nervousness , and other indications of a systemic ailment . SO THE doctor treats you thoroughly ? not just your aching joints . First he gives you confidence in the future . This reassurance is important if you are to get well , for victims of arthritis frequently are seriously depressed , first by their fears and then by their pains . If you are to cooperate with the doctor ? and your cooperation is essential ? you must believe you will get well . Then he goes after any possible source of infection . He sends you to , have bad teeth or tonsils out . He orders care for your sinuses . And he builds you up with a nourishing diet and rest . Complete rest in bed is essential in certain forms of arthritis , when the patient has fever and severely inflamed joints ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously inflamed . In milder cases , which are far more common , rest tempered with exercise is extremely important , for fatigue is as much a guide to your condition as is the state of your joints . Your doctor may order you to sleep 10 or 12 hours at night and take a nap after lunch , too . Proper food is helpful . You 'll like the diet . Our grandparents suffered not only with rheumatism , but with a lot of horrid restrictions on food . Today the doctor gives you a more-than-adequate diet , because probably you 've already lost weight . The diet will contain plenty of such minerals as calcium , phosphorus , and iron , for these help your joints . He 'll give you vitamins A and D in cod-liver oil , and see to it that you have vitamin B in whole grains and vitamin C in fruit juices . If necessary , he will supplement your diet with concentrates ; but a menu that contains plenty of fresh fruit and @#  | at least two glasses of fruit ? juice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butter , and ree glasses of milk daily probdo the trick . it anemia , the doctor will adand iron preparations .

The orthopedic Burn work wonders ; but only a bone st is fully equipped to operate on les , of an arthritic patient . E are the outlines of the treatLs employed by conservative memthe medical profession . There ers . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sed in this country and England , my famous doctors are their enic advocates . The treatment does mission from the disease in a fair age of cases , but it involves defzards ; it may be accompanied by ations in the bone marrow , kider , or brain . In the New England of Medicine last year Drs . WalCharles L. Short , and William Quail , of Massachusetts General say they are " convinced that experience is necessary before V the therapeutic value of gold matoid arthritis . . . . From the in the literature and from our eliminary results , the case for a specific treatment remains un ... It is not constantly effective carries a danger of toxicity too  | great for any but an indispensable drug . " Other measures are being tried , not too successfully . Vaccines are involved in one ; sulfur , in another . Bee venom has been advocated , and so have huge doses of vitamin D. Some doctors are hopeful about endocrine preparations . Most clinics reject all these , in general ; but any one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , ovarian hormones are occasionally helpful , especially to women who suffer also from symptoms of the menopause . Rheumatoid arthritis must be treated according to the requirements of each sufferer . Do n't , therefore , demand some fabulous treatment your friends have read about . There is no specific for arthritis . Just remember that your doctor will plan a treatment to make you generally healthy , taking into consideration anemia , infections , emotional problems , ? need for rest and exercise , and so on . Then your natural resources will be mobilized to help overcome the disease . Do n't go into a tailspin if you suspect or if your doctor diagnoses rheumatoid arthritis . In the great majority of cases it can be cured or at least arrested . The crippling that occurred in the past can be averted . Take care of your general health ? that 's a preventive against all hazards . If you are attacked by arthritis , do n't despair . But do n't delay . Go at once to your doctor ; do exactly as he advises . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
