 | You may remember the article about coffee we published some months ago . And that we made some remarks about the grind of coffee to be used in your coffee-maker . When the article was being written , that subject was discussed at considerable length with some members of the Staff , and the conclusion was I reached that we needed to do some experimental work on coffee grinds , in order to give you more exact information . Since then , as opportunity served , we have been brewing and tasting and checking and rechecking , in order to try to fmd an answer to the question : " Can one grind of coffee be used in all types of coffee-maker or is it necessary to have several available ? " We used some 25 pounds of 6 different brands of coffee , and we brewed 102 pots of coffee ? in drip pots , in percolators , and in vacuumtype glass coffee-makers . Eighteen men and forty-six women ? the editor of this magazine , other executives , engineers , chemists , home economists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiments , comparing one cup of coffee with another ? more than 700 cups . How did we make these investigations ? Suppose we take the percolator for example . Two identical pots were used ; the same amount of coffee was weighed out into each ; the same amount of water measured to a fraction of an ounce was placed in each ; the time of operation was kept the same to within two or three seconds . The only difference between the two pots was in the grind of coffee used . Naturally the same brand of coffee was used in both ; but in one it was ground to what is popularly called a percolator grind , in the other to a drip grind . When the two brews were ready ( they were kept at about the same temperature , too ) , they were served in pairs of cups to the tasters ? one cup from each pot . Each person was allowed to use cream and sugar according to individual taste , and each was asked which cup was preferred . Twenty to forty individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brand of coffee . In the case of the drip pots we compared drip and percolator grinds ; in the vacuum-type glass coffee-makers we used drip and pulverized grinds . With the drip coffee-makers , we used in some cases a pair of very efficient , rather expensive pots ; in other cases , we used a pair of cheap . rather inefficient pots . And what did we discover ? Briefly this : A drip grind will give better results ? in strength and quality of flavor ? in practically all types of pot . In the case of the inexpensive drip pot , it gave just as good results ; in the other pots it was preferred by 2 out of 3 tasters . Here is the record : PERCOLATOR 53 votes for the drip 24 votes for the percolator VACUUM COFFEE-MAKER 67 votes for the drip 44 votes for the pulverized DRIP POTS ( more expensive type ) 65 votes for the drip 27 votes for the percolator ( inexpensive type ) 37 votes for the drip 40 votes for the percolator We are sure that you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same comparisons . Only one of the 64 tasters had ever had any professional coffeetasting experience . The other 63 were jus " people , " with average tastes ? some with a keen appreciation of flavors , some rather insensitive , and the rest in between . Of course , both the quality of the flavor and the quantity or strength were important in deciding on a choice . Good Housekeeping 's advice to you , therefore . is to ask for a drip grind the next time you buy coffee . This will help to give you coffee of the strength and quality of flavor you wish . Grinds of coffee differ in their fineness There are no standards of fineness for coffees , and one roaster 's idea of wha : constitutes the proper drip grind may differ somewhat from the next . In general . however , the coarsest grind is the percolator grind ? or , as it sometimes i called , the regular grind . Next in fineness is the drip , sometimes called an allpurpose grind by roasters who recognize that it is suitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes also named after the manufacturer of one of the brands of vacuum glass coffeemakers . Each one of these is really a mixture of different-size particles . The percolator grind has a higher percentage of coarse particles and a smaller percentage of dustlike particles than the drip . The pulverized grind is made up mostly of very fine , almost flourlike particles , with some slightly larger . As for the pulverized grind , our results corroborate the findings of the Coffee Brewing Committee of the National Coffee Association . That group of experts . after making very exhaustive tests , came to the conclusion that the pulverized grind produced inferior coffee and should not be used in a vacuum glass coffeemaker when a high-quality brew is desired . The Committee decided that the drip grind was far preferable to the finer . It is commonly held by coffee experts that the great pressure and strenuous  | hanical action necessary to pulverize tee produces so much heat that the vor-producing constituents are adely affected . Our results , however , go a little farther n those of the Brewing Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee-makand the question of whether or not e pulverized grind was desirable . They ntinued to recommend the use of the rcolator grind for percolators . Our experiments show that the drip grind is preferable to the percolator grind even for use in percolators . Of course , there are hundreds of makes of coffeepot on the market ? large and small , good , bad , and indifferent ? and we could not begin to try out every brand . We have had a good deal of experience in the examination and checking of such devices , however , and believe that our conclusions in respect to the use of the drip grind will hold for the great majority of coffee-makers on the market . There may be a few exceptions ? perhaps in certain makes of percolator , where the use of a finer grind will increase the sediment in the brew . There are plenty of percolators , though , that will produce satisfactory coffee with the drip grind . We know , because we always use this grind when we examine percolators . In our checks on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place , we had an opportunity to determine carefully just how to operate them when the drip grind is used . Ordinarily , with the pulverized grind , the pot is removed from the heat as soon as the water has been forced into the upper bowl . The only change necessary when the drip grind is used is to continue to heat the pot ( perhaps more gently ) , so that the water remains in the upper bowl for an extra four to five minutes . This allows time for the extraction of flavor from the larger particles . Also we observed that final flavor and strength are the same whether you start with cold water in the lower bowl and attach the upper one at once or wait until the water is almost ready to boil before attaching . Further , if you have a hot-water supply ( from the faucet ) free from foreign taste , there is no reason why you ca n't use it . YOU may have seen the statement ? printed in various newspapers and magazines ? that you can slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the refrigerator . Theoretically this procedure might be of value , since it is well known that cold retards spoilage and other forms of deterioration . However , there is nothing like trying out a scheme to see if it works . So that is what we did . We bought several brands of coffee , divided each pound into two portions , and stored one of each in an electric refrigerator . The other portion of each brand was kept in a kitchen cupboard . Every few days we compared the flavor of all samples . After two weeks we concluded that there was nothing in the idea . Several tasters agreed that there was no difference in flavor or evidence of staleness between the cupboard samples and those kept in the refrigerator . So do n't expect to save flavor by keeping coffee in the refrigerator ; you wo n't be able to tell the difference . Apparently the household refrigerator is not cold enough to cause any appreciable slowing up in the deterioration .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
