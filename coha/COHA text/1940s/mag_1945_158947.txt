Jug-eared Bill Talbert , unbeaten in nine tune-up tournaments , admitted that his game was better than ever ; the 64th United States Lawn Tennis Champion ships looked like a breeze . Then Sergeant Frank Parker flew in from Guam , 10 lbs . thinner and fitter , razor-sharp from Marianas matches with Wayne Sabin , Don Budge and Bobby Riggs . Said Singles Champion Parker : " My game is better than ever . . . . " <P> Bits of Brilliance . Except for the practice , there was no good reason why the other 46 entrants in the men 's singles bothered to compete at Forest Hills last week . None of them ever had a chance . But between lunges and tumbles , they squeezed in bits of brilliant tennis . <P> One came the first day when 16-year-old Herb Flam ( TIME , Aug. 13 ) began skidding on the smooth turf , shook off his shoes and blasted Argentina 's No. 2 player , Heraldo Weiss off the court . There 's a coming Davis Cupper , said wise old tongues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim , succumbing to Major Frank Guernsey , a pint-size fighter pilot who prefers golf to tennis . <P> Collapsible Francis Xavier Shields ran true to form and collapsed in the third round . Sidney Wood 's erratic virtuosity survived four rounds . The semifinals drew the biggest crowd ( 8,000 ) in three years , and they cheered as madly as a mannerly tennis crowd could for Elwood Cooke 's brave but hopeless stand against methodical Frankie Parker . In the other semifinals , Ecuador s pigeon-toed Pancho Segura learned once again that his two-fisted drives and self-satisfied " Bravos " were no match for Bill Talbert 's power strokes . Talbert won easily at the cost of a twisted knee . <P> That set the stage for the preordained finale . But first Sarah Palfrey Cooke , back at Forest Hills after four years , recovered her abdicated singles throne . With green-ribboned pigtails flying , she beat Pauline Betz 3-6 , 8-6 , 6-4 , and earned a husbandly kiss from Elwood . <P> Lots of Alibi . Overnight , Talbert 's knee stiffened so he could barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crack : " There 's nothing wrong with my knee , except I ca n't bend it . " Somehow , he covered enough ground to beat Parker the first two games . Then , when the count had evened at 4-all , the two battled through 18 games without a break in service . The crowd of 12,000 rose to applaud - and stretch - when Talbert 's tremendous serve put him ahead , 12-11 . But after doing the impossible on one good leg , Talbert did n't have any more . The robot-calm Parker took the set 14-12 , the next two 6-1 , 6-2 . <P> With Davis Cup play due for resumption next summer , the championships were a useful inventory of U.S. talent . Talbert and Parker seem certain team choices . Their fellow-travelers may well be Champions Lieut . Ted Schroeder and Ensign Jack Kramer , if they are out of uniform by then . Such a foursome seemed a poor bet to win the cup back from the Australians , who have Veterans Jack Bromwich , Adrian Quist and Pat Crawford , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Australians can hardly wait to spring Ducky on the world .
