txt The promised 25 per ' cent cut in the State income tax moved a step nearer a fact today as both houses of the Legislature passed all major budget and tax bills . Governor Lehman , who recommended the cut in his budget message , is expected to sign the bills in a few days , after which taxpayers will be told how to make the deduction on their returns . The cut is on the income tax returnable April 15 and also on this year 's tax , returnable April 15 , 1943 . In addition the 1 per cent over-all emergency tax was not enacted last year and will not be collected this year , for the first time since 1935 . Much of this was overlooked in the Assembly debate today , as the exact amount the Republicans cut from Governor Lehman 's original budget was disputed , along partisan lines , and as each party contended for credit for budget reduction and tax reduction and accused the other of being a fair-weather friend to the State 's educational system , which will get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1938 . In the Senate , however , the issue was clearer cut . Senator Dunnigan , minority ' leader , asked complete credit for the cut for Governor Lehman , and Senator Hanley , majority leader , declared that if the Governor had had his way on the budget in the last four years no tax cut would have been possible . 83 ' 75,000,000 Budget Is Likely The budget as adopted will be $375,000,000 to $380,000,000 when all fiscal action for the session is completed . Each side makes claim to compensating deductions and expenditures . The Republicans are expected to undertake , to cut revenues slightly and increase costs by a proposed shift in the armory tax , as reported yesterday . however , the principal reductions made this year by the Republicans consist of $3,000,000 off the relief estimates , $1,500,000 off other costs , with restorations of $1,700,000 for State aid for education and $1,600,000 for pay rises . Earlier in the day the Senate passed and sent to the Governor the two Whitney bills permitting payment of the State income tax in quarterly installments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor will veto these measures , unless Assemblyman Moffat , chairman of the Ways and Means Committee , can work out a satisfactory plan for shifting the date of the State 's fiscal year , effective in 1944 , so that the State 's ' borrowing , because of delayed income tax payments , will be limited to two fiscal years . During , the Assembly debate on the budget , the Democrats accused the Republicans of first cutting State aid for education , in 1939 and 1940 . They said that Governor Lehman did not make any cut in the educational budget until 1941 . Republicans Make Rebuttal Republicans replied that conditions were different then , that they made provisions for specific rather than blanket economies in education , and dared Governor Lehman to veto the new appropriation . There is no indication that the Governor has considered such a step . Senator Dunnigan declared that the Republican policy on education was a cycle , following the proximity to election years , which brought a sharp retort from Senator Hanley that educational problems were serious , that the cuts had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Discussion ' of the relief item in the Assembly brought to the surface a corollary problem which has been worrying legislative leaders . The Governor first cut the relief estimate expenditures about $6,000 , - 000 and then chopped off an additional $4,000,000 . Now the Republicans have taken off $3,000,000 more , bringing the total reduction to $13,000,000 , compared with last year . When the Democrats attacked this statement on two grounds , first that it was no economy ' but just a reduction in estimates , and also that it was an attempt to force , by suggestion , a dropping of local relief ' standards and rolls , Assemblyman Moffat , Republican fiscal expert , said that the State faced a serious labor shortage , in industrial and farm labor . Shift of Labor Is Envisioned He said that if persons had to be shifted , even to their inconvenience , from one part of the State to another to meet war labor demands , it might have to be done . Modified " work or do n't eat " legislation , which is on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take jobs for which they are qualified , allowing others to be shifted to defense jobs . He said that there was serious talk of bringing migrant farmhands from the South for harvesting and farm work . He warned that most of these , if they came , would wind up in Harlem when Winter came , thus aggravating overcrowded conditions . The Democratic argument as to the budget , as expressed by Senator Dunnigan , was that the Republican reductions were either petty or no reductions at all , that the Republican budget program of recent years involved unconstitutional budgets , . cuts in education , cutting of State services and refusal to make necessary military appropriations . To this Senator Hanley had an answer which will undoubtedly be used by Republicans in the Fall campaign . It was that in 1935 the Governor fought , with a barrage of messages , against the $26,000,000 budget cut which Republicans imposed that year ; that he did the same thing the next year , and that without Republican insistence on economy , no tax reduction would have been possible this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
