Last year the Australians made their challenge for the Davis Cup without lanky Veteran ( 30 ) Jack Bromwich ; it would have meant a trip by air , and Bromwich preferred ships . This time the Aussies traveled Jack 's way and he came along as playing captain . It helped some , but not enough . At Forest Hills last week , the Aussies took the doubles ( with Bromwich and 29-year-old Billy Sidwell as heroes ) , but the U.S. 's Ted Schroeder and Pancho Gonzales trod the challengers down under in the singles to keep the cup , 4-1 . Australia 's consolation : it was a bit better than last year 's 5-0 . <P> Other winners of the week : At Chicago 's Washington Park , Calumet Farm 's Ponder , with Jockey Steve Brooks up , sizzled a mile and a quarter in 2:oo-a new track record . The $66,150 he won made Ponder the turf 's leading ' moneywinner of the year ( $267,525 ) . At Chicago 's Comiskey Park , Red Sox Left-Hander Mel Parnell hurled his team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became the first major-league pitcher to win 20 games this year .
