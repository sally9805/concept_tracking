txt SARATOGA SPRINGS , N. Y. , Sept. ** Governor Herbert H. Lehman began his race for the United States Senate here today with an indirect but obvious attack on the political ' credo of his Republican opponent , Senator John Foster Dulles . Mr. Lehman , tanned and healthy after a summer-long vacation at his home in near-by Lake Placid , chose the tenth annual convention of the State Congress of Industrial Organizations as the Sounding board for his first campaign address . He received from the 1,000 delegates , representing more than a million union members , a warm reception . As he entered the auditorium even some left-wing representatives rose to welcome him , although they kept their seats when he departed . The text of former Governor Lehman 's address is on Page 4.1 Leaders of the Liberal party , which has also endorsed Mr. Lehman , could take scant comfort from his remarks . He made it quite clear that he spoke as a Democrat and he soundly endorsed the candidacy of Mayor O'Dwyer for reelection . In what was ' widely taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trend to " statism " in government , Mr : Lehman outlined his own political philosophy and that of his party . ' We believe that nothing can be permitted to take priority over human rights , " he said . " But far from riding ruthlessly over any of the several groups which comprise the state , we recognize the interdependence of all groups , and seek to respect the needs of each and to safeguard their just aspirations . " To the aged , security ; to the industrial workers , free collective bargaining , good wages and enlightened working conditions ; to the farmer , fair prices for their produce ; to the bank depositors , insurance against loss ; to the investors , an unrigged market ; to the homeless , adequate low-cost housing ; to the youth , sound education ; to the business man , fair opportunity for individual effort and initiative ; and above all we are seeking political and social equality without regard to race , // LEHMAN ATTACKS REPUBLICAN CHIEFS // religion , color or national origin . " After outlining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws , " the former Governor declared : " I know that some critics of government do not like these things ; they do not like any kind of expansion of human services in government . Accused Republican Leaders " Most of these critics do not understand , can not see , that public processes stem from and are tied to the community growth and to the needs that are characteristic of that community growth . " Human processes of government will continue . They will grow . This is not a mere wish or a mere hope . It is inevitable because democracy today is in its ascendancy . It is pervading every department of humane life ? in America and in every free country of the world . " Mr. Lehman drew a distinction between the views of the leaders of the Republican party and those of the rank and file of the party . This was taken as another oblique reference to Mr. ' Dulles . He said : " The benefits of these laws , which our people now enjoy , came out of great striving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them was at first opposed and obstructed by Republican leaders . " I have deliberately underscored the word ' leaders ' because I wish to emphasize that in my opinion the majority of the rank and file of Republicans are just as much interested in progressive government as those of my own party . " The labor delegates cheered the smiling candidate repeatedly . His address was followed by a vigorous appeal to the convention from Jacob S. Potofsky , president of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers , to set in motion at once their political action machinery for Mr. Lehman 's election . The delegates adopted a resolution endorsing the former Governor 's candidacy . There was one other ? principal order of businesp on this morning 's agenda , which brought the threeday convention to a close . This was a full-dress debate on the subject of CIO policy , with top representatives of the right and left wings taking the floor . Today 's floor discussion followed a closed and heated meeting of the state . CIO executive board last night . It was understood that there Allan S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leftists in direct language the action that would be taken against them at the organization 's convention in Cleveland next month . It was ' carnet ' . that Mr. Haywood had said that the convention would demand conformity . He told the left-wingers that if they refused , they could leave , and threatened that if they did , right-wing affiliates were prepared to take over their memberships . He was said to be particularly angered at attacks on President Philip Murray . Irving Potash , vice president of the fur workers and one of the eleven de'endants in the Communist conspiracy trial , was the chief spokesman for the leftists . He is said to have told Mr. Haywood that his bloc of unions was expressing the viewpoint of its members and could not be found on other than economic issues by the policies of the CIO . In today 's floor debate Mr. Potash said : " I am making a plea for a united CIO . " " A trade union is not a political party . You can not tell the workers or officials of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . If you do that you turn a labor union into a political organization and wreck it . " Mr. Potash was answered by Jack Altman , vice president of the Retail and Wholesale Union ; Jack Rubinstein , vice president of the Textile Workers and by Louis Hollander , president of the State CIO . Their chief argument was that the issue was domination of some CIO unions by the Communist party . They demanded that these unions follow the policies of the CIO and not of the party .
