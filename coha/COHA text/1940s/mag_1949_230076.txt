<P> Because of Canada 's traditionally mild manners in world affairs , foreign-policy debates in Parliament have often seemed stale and tepid . Last week 's scheduled debate gave no special promise of being any exception . Less than 48 hours before he was to lead off the discussion , Lester ( " Mike " ) Pearson , Secretary of State for External Affairs , was still in New York , at the United Nations meeting . On his way back to Ottawa he stopped off for the opening of Toronto 's Royal Winter Fair . He came into Ottawa on a morning train , having written part of his speech en route ; he put the finishing touches to it only a few minutes before Parliament opened . <P> Even in the green-carpeted Commons chamber there was no air of anticipation . Although the diplomatic corps had been told that Parliament would get its first review of Canadian foreign policy since last summer 's general election , only four foreign diplomats showed up . <P> Policy Partnership . Secretary Pearson 's speech turned out to be one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Canadian Parliament . In 90 minutes , he made it clear that the old Canadian policy of stringing along calmly with Britain and the U.S. , developed and consistently followed by Mackenzie King , was no longer the rule under Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent . Canada had some strong opinions of her own and she wanted policymaking partnership with the big powers . Said Pearson : " The U.S. must . . . recognize Canada ... as a cooperating partner , not as a camp follower . " <P> Pearson cited examples of current U.S.Canadian problems and hinted broadly at Canadian impatience over delays in working out solutions . Among the sorest points were the U.S. failure to iron out its air-rights agreement with Canada , and the dispute over judicial and customs rights at U.S.-leased military bases in Newfoundland ( TIME , Nov. 14 ) . Pearson also complained of the U.S. practice of barring certain Canadian visitors to the U.S. on seemingly capricious political grounds . <P> Facts to Face . Western governments , Pearson warned , may soon have to do business with the Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in consultation with other friendly governments have to recognize the facts . " He thought that the military occupation of Japan should be ended as quickly as possible and a peace treaty drawn up , with Canada participating . One of his most significant remarks touched on Canada 's relations with Latin America . Said Pearson : " We should broaden and deepen our association with the Latin republics of this hemisphere . " That was the nearest any cabinet minister had ever come to saying that Canada should join the Pan-American Union . <P> What effect Canada 's more self-assertive foreign policy might have outside the country remained to be seen . But there was no doubt about the reaction at home . Members of Parliament thumped their desks enthusiastically . Newspapers hailed Pearson 's speech as " a penetrating analysis " and " a masterly survey . " For a change , Canadians clearly liked a little muscle-flexing in foreign affairs .
