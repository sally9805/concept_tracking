A new air-purifying device designed for U.S. woodworking mills is unprecedented because it 1 ) removes wood dust by centrifugal force ; 2 ) concentrates it as a byproduct that is salable in carload lots at $35 a ton . The machine sucks in dusty air , sets it whirling at high speeds . The particles of dust fly to the periphery and clean air comes out of the vortex . <P> <P> The collected wood dust is shipped east to plastics makers . " Wood flour forms the base for practically all the plastics , " explains the machine 's inventor , Engineer Frederick Kurt Kirsten of the University of Washington . " Up to now it has had to be ground-a laborious process-and much of it came from Norway and Sweden . " Within a few weeks , a plywood factory in Portland , Ore . sold several carloads of wood dust , a profitable by-product of purifying its air .
