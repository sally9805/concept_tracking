What was the statistical basis for the prediction that Republicans will take over the House ? Last week TIME correspondents reported from crucial districts in crucial states . A compilation of their reports , based on local polls and the best guesses of local experts , disclosed that Republicans , who now hold 192 seats in Congress , would make the following net gains : California ( 2 ) , Illinois ( 3 ) , Indiana ( 1 ) , Michigan ( 4 ) , Missouri ( 2 ) , New York ( 6 ) , Ohio ( 2 ) , Pennsylvania ( 6 ) , Washington ( 1 ) , West Virginia ( 2 ) . <P> Total : 29 , which would enable the G.O.P. <P> to organize the House . Connecticut , Wisconsin and Oklahoma , where races are too confused to guess , may add to the margin . <P> To the Ashcan . Behind the impersonal figures are some colorful personalities . <P> The report from Michigan means that Frank E. Hook , belligerent spokesman of labor , is probably headed for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Louis Ludlow , aging , ailing , rabid isolationist . <P> The Republican counted on to beat him : young Albert J. Beveridge Jr. , son of the great orator and Progressive . <P> It means that the Missouri seat held for 20 years by able Jack Cochran , who scarcely had to lift a finger to get elected and who recently retired , will now go to a Republican . <P> In New York , it means that the seat of the late William B. Barry in Republican Queens will go to the G.O.P. It means that Donald O'Toole , leftist , will be beaten in usually solidly Democratic Brooklyn ; that Charles A. Buckley will go down to defeat in Democratic Bronx . <P> In short , Democrats who had held control by combining the solid South with their strength in Northern industrial centers showed signs of cracking in the cities . <P> Landslide ? In the privacy of the voting booth , contemplating 14 years of Democratic rule , voters may dump many another Democrat overboard . Then such candidates for re-election as radical Hugh De Lacey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gracious , conscientious Emily Taft Douglas , of Illinois , handsome Helen Gahagan Douglas , of California - all of whom are hotly engaged - will also disappear . Not only would there then be no question of Republicans organizing the House ; the Republicans would have solid , unassailable control .
