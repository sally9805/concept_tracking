After 13 years of Dollfuss , Schuschnigg and Hitler , Anschluss , war and defeat , a record turnout of about 3,500,000 Austrian voters had their say last week in a free election , for a change . The Austrian voters said , decisively , that they did not like Communism . In the zone occupied by the Red Army they said it stronger than anywhere else . <P> The result was the second rude jolt to Russian prestige in Russian-occupied lands in a month . Hungary 's Communists had been snowed under by the Small Holders Party ( TIME , Nov. 12 ) . Now Austria 's Communists went down to defeat even in the working-class districts of Vienna and Wiener Neustadt . The Volks-partei , heir to Dollfuss ' old Christian Social Party and catchall for former members of the Pan-German and Heimwehr parties , rolled up about half of the vote . The Social Democrats got more than 40% . <P> When all the returns were in , Austria was back where it had been 15 years ago , with results almost matching those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Red Vienna " had voted heavily Social Democrat . Once again the " black countryside " had voted for the Right . And the Communists , nowhere then , were nowhere now .
