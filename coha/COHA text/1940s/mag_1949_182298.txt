ELEPHANT AND CASTLE ( 658 pp. ) -R . C. Hufchinson-Rinehart ( $3.75 ) . <P> Take a well-bred young English lady named Armorel Cepinnier and bind her in matrimony to Gian ( " Toughie " ) Ardree , an Italian-born bricklayer with quick fists and a slow brain , and you can have a nice stew of social and psychological problems . Set the uplift-minded Armorel and the hairy-chested Toughie to living in one of the meanest streets of one of London 's slums , and the stew is likely to become too thick to stir . <P> Author Hutchinson has stirred away so bravely that Elephant and Castle , his character-caravan of London between the wars , is currently being compared by blurb artists to the novels of Dickens , Trollope and Thackeray . He has cooked so many people into his plot ( over 100 in all ) that he has had to include an explanatory list of them . His dialogues range from the chirpings of Armorel 's ultra-refined relations ( " Cousin Freddie , do n't you think it 's awful for Mums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nest ? " ) to the Anglo-Genoese babblings of Gian 's momma ( " Ayee ! Serris my Gian . . . allo , mi ' picciolo ! " ) . But Elephant and Castle is still a dreary stew of tragedy , haphazardly spiced with a few onions of Cockney humor that do n't always mix too well with the rest . <P> When Armorel falls in love with Gian she devotes her life to improving him , passionately believing that under his simple-simian surface he has a heart of gold ( which is true ) and a fine intellect ( which is not ) . She goes about her miscalculated mission with such iron ferocity that toward the end of the book some readers will want to liquidate her . They will not have to worry ; Gian 's nutty old father does that job admirably by slitting her throat , and Gian is convicted of the murder and hanged . <P> Elephant and Castle seems to be due for the bestseller lists-partly because of the popular impression that any book about poor and violent Londoners , containing 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be strongest among people who have not read Dickens lately .
