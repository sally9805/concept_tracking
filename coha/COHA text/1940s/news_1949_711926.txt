txt Peace negotiations in the Republican budget fight struck a snag today . Legislative spokesmen for Governor Dewey refused to improve their offer of a $20,000,000 appropriations cut and the Westchester and Erie insurgents rejected the proposal for substituting new excise levies for part of Mr. Dewey 's $168,200,000 program to increase revenues . Among ' he new excise levies that have been suggested as alternatives for part of the tax increases proposed by Governor Dewey were a soft drink tax , to raise $18,000,000 ; a cigar tax to raise $6,000,000 ; a billboard tax to raise $1,000,000 and taxes on insurance investment yields to raise $3,500,000 . Spokesmen for both Republican groups in the Legislature were discouraged tonight after a series of fruitless informal conferences on budget cuts and taxes but still retained hope that a compromise satisfactory to both would eventually be achieved . Reflecting the change in the status of the negotiations , Senator Benjamin F. Feinberg , Senate majority leader and chief legislative spokesman for the Dewey admin istration , said tonight that the possibility of a budget vote on Tuesday was becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wilr have to be postponed until later next week while negotiations continue . Spread of Controversy Likely Meantime , with feelings rising on both sides , the battle threatened definitely to broaden into a struggle between the executive and legislative branches of the state government for political supremacy . This would affect not only the budget and tax bills but all pending legislative controversies . This threat is being intensified by suppressed grievances which individual Republican legislators have accumulated in seven years of submission to the Governor 's leadership in matters of state policy . If the threat should materialize , the present session could be prolonged for a substantial period . Among the controversies awaiting settlement are clarification of the relationship between the Board of Regents and the State University trustees , disability compensation , establishment of a state-wide building code and increased state aid for schools . Even if the threat does not niet terialise , there is a strong probability that the slit will spill over into the selection of a new Republican state chairman to replace Glen R. Bedenkapp , now a member of the Public Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Sane H. Todd of Westchester . Leaders Define Their Stand In rejecting the idea of imposing substitute levies for the $168 , - 200,000 in tax increases requested by the Governor in his budget message , spokesmen for the Erie and Westchester Republicans declared that the administration misinterpreted the whole purpose of their stand . Their protest , they said , was not against the particular forms of tax proposed by the Governor but against the rise id the cost of government . Instead of tha $20,000,000 in cuts that administration negotiators offered , the insurgents want a minimum cut of $48,000,000 . The $20,000,000 reduction would permit elimination of the proposed one-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax rise ; the $48,000,000 slash would allow elimination of the gasoline tax rise and a 10 per cent cut in the income-tax figure below the levels suggested by the Governor . As a substitute , for elimination of the gasoline tax the adminis tration has suggested that 10 per cent of the yield of the additional levy be turned over to counties , outside of New York City , for secondary roads . This would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retained , a combination of budget cuts and substitute taxes // would permit the 10 per cent income-tax cut , it was said . While holding some appeal for Erie and for potential insurgents in other up-state counties , the gasoline tax suggestion is definitely unacceptable to Westchester which long has been complaining that it fails to get a proper share from present gasoline taxes because it has so few secondary roads . It is also likely to arouse opposition from New York City Republican legislators since New York gets no part of the $18,000,000 in gasoline tax revenues returned to the counties under existing law and would get no part of the additional $2,000,000 . Anticipating that its proposals to change the plans on the gasoline tax and income tax might not be acceptable , the administration group suggested as an alternative a $20,000,000 budget cut , plus imposition of the proposed billboard , cigar , soft-drink and insurance investment excises . If this did not involve substitute taxes of sucii poliacally embarrassing potentialities , it probably would have been seized on by the insurgents , but their stand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tax cuts must be financed entirely I by budget savings . NegoLiations are scheduled to continue on an informal basis over the week-end with a formal attempt to reach agreement early next week . In preparation for , it , the administration group is report ? ed considering other substitute taxes , such as a levy on admis , sions . The necessity for an early decision on the question was emphasized today by an announcement from the Department of Taxation and Finance that there would be no further extensions of time for Mtn by employers of the 1948 income-tax withholding reports on non-resident employes . Withholding reports and the tax withheld from pay of nonresident employes are due on Saturday , March 12 . The commission said employers would pay 100 per cent of the withheld tax . Should the Legislature subsequently enact a reduction of the tax  --  Governor Dewey has suggested it be fixed at 90 per cent ? proper adjustments would be made , the announcement said . Employers are required under existing law to withhold 100 per cent of the amounts due for normal state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from nonresidents . Residents , who have until April 15 to file returns , and make their payments , are liable for the 10 per cent surtax for the bonus redemption fund in addition to the . formal tax . If . the Governor 's proposal is accepted they will pay 90 pet cent of normal for ordinary state purposes and 10 per cent for bonus redemption .
