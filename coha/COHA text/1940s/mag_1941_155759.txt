The career of a redhaired , chubby-legged little U.S. boy , Corky Kelly , age one and a half , was mapped out for him last week by a great planner . To the President of the U.S. in 1956 , Mr. Roosevelt wrote : <P> " I am writing this letter as an act of faith in the destiny of our country . . . . My request is that you consider the merits of a young American youth of goodly heritage-Colin P. Kelly , III-for appointment as a Cadet in the United States Military Academy at West Point . I make this appeal in behalf of this youth as a token of the Nation 's appreciation of the heroic services of his father , who met death in line of duty at the very outset of the struggle which was thrust upon us by the perfidy of a professed friend . . . . "
