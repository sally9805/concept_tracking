On Christmas Eve , 1942 , the newspapers carried a small notice to the effect that nine enlisted men aboard a Coastal Picket yawl , which had been blown far out to sea some weeks before , had finally been rescued by Army , Navy , and Coast Guard ships and planes . This is the story of those nine men , and incidentally of the co-ordinated rescue work of all branches of the armed forces , under orders of the Commander Eastern Sea Frontier . I was not on the yawl during her long ordeal , though I have since been out on patrol aboard her . But in order to have the reader share as vividly as possible the experience of those brave men , 1 have written the story as it might have been told by any one of them , interrupting the narrative from time to time with passages in italics which tell how the Navy organized and carried out the search for the missing vessel. ? The Author ONE of the smallest vessels at the Coastal Picket Base at Gre.enport , Long Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar in Larchmont yachting circles as George Ratsey 's Zaida before her owner turned her over for the duration to the Navy and Coast Guard for use in off-shore anti-submarine patrol . Those of us in the Coast Guard Reserve who had been assigned as crew to the Zaida were pretty happy about it . Some of us had known her before she got her covering of war paint ? a trim vessel with the sheer lines of a racing craft , but wide enough of beam to be comfortable and dry , even with all sails set in a spanking breeze . The 3070 had been commissioned October 1 , 1942 , and since then had been outon patrol four times . Our station was about fifty miles offshore . It seems odd to call it a " station " because it was only an area of fifteen square miles plotted on our chart , and we had to depend on the skipper to tell us when we had reached it . So far as appearances went , we might just as well have been sailing around in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except the uneasy ocean flattened out in all directions to the horizon . We could patrol our grid any way we wanted to because our only assignments were to keep constant lookout while on station , to report any unusual occurrences , and to be prepared for such rescue operations as we might have a chance to carry out . On days when the weather permitted we might take advantage of a good breeze to beat up into the wind on alternate tacks until we neared one edge of our station , then come about and sail back toward the middle of the grid on a comfortable reach or run . But the chances were that there would be enough rough weather to make us satisfied with letting Zaida ride the seas hove to . Once we were on station and had everything snugged down , only the two men on watch had to worry about submarines . The rest of us would drop a line overboard , fool around with odd jobs , or go below and sleep . I do n't know why it was that we always felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't often work out so that anyone could get anything like an eight-hour stretch of sleep . The two men who stood the mid-to-four watch would have only about two hours in their bunks before the clatter of dishes and the smell of Java and bacon from the galley would wake them up . If they slept until the fellows began shouting the breakfast " Chow down " that would usually be the end of their cat nap . And if they slept through that there would be the noise of five or six men gathering round the table , rattling silver and mugs and plates , talking and laughing . The crew used to waste a lot of time arguing about which was the worst watch to stand . It all depended on the weather . Otherwise there was n't really much to choose among them . You might even say that each watch had something in its favor . Of course the daylight watches from eight to noon and noon to four were pretty much alike . When there was nothing in sight on the horizon there was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for periscopes or telltale feathers of wake where the periscopes might be . We would keep imagining that we were seeing things . Let the wind change enough to kick rollers into a chop , and there would be all kinds of lights and shadows on the water , so that you would be sure that you saw at least a dozen periscopes before the end of each watch . Every time you saw a whale or a porpoise it gave your stomach a sudden turn ; the fellows on watch often shouted " submarine " too quickly , and got a razzing from the others when they came on deck to seewhere the sub was . And just the constant thinking about what might happen was enough to give you the feeling that there was no friendly vessel within a hundred miles of Zaida . Then you might sight a ship hull down on the horizon , and it would be a relief to worry that blurred image through the powerful binoculars until she had disappeared or until her course brought her near enough to be recognized for what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyer . That would make you feel better to think that you were really a part of the whole big hide-and-seek game going on along our coast , all the way from Monhegan Island to Key West . Another kind of excitement during daylight watches was the occasional appear . ance of blimps and planes . The trouble with the planes was that they would sight us after we had sighted them ; would suddenly change course and come round to give us the once-over . On bright days that would be pleasant enough , but on foggy or cloudy days we always had the feeling that the plane might see us just as she was passing over and , mistaking us for a submarine , impulsively drop a couple of eggs on us and blow us to hell . On nights when there were neither stars nor moon time seemed to drag heaviest . Two of us on watch would talk ourselves out after a while and just sit in the cockpit staring at the blackness all round us . Ears took the place of eyes , and we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hull and under the taffrail . Occasionally , if we talked in low voices , one of us would stop in the middle of a sentence , certain there had been an unfamiliar noise . There was no need to say , " Listen . " We would sit there , straining to hear something that might have been nothing . After a little the conversation would begin again , always low and deliberate , so we could listen overside between pauses . That kind of watch made you more tired than a watch kept with moon and stars for company . It would always seem longer between the hourly reports over the radio telephone . Somehow we liked to hear the radio phone tubes warming up and the static beginning to crackle through the loudspeaker . That phone was our one sure proof that we had not been completely forgotten by those ashore . Usually there was no reason for us to make reports at the hourly times ; but it was nice to listen for the voices of men on the other Picket Boats and see what they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check in with the shore radio station just to let them know that our set was in order and that all was well with us . No matter how routine that might become , it was always an occasion when Zaida spoke her little piece and was acknowledged by the crisp voice of the monitor in the radio station on shore . II - su- ou get nine men penned up in a ship the size of Zaida and they get to know one another pretty well . By the time we started on our fourth patrol , just after Thanksgiving , most of us felt as if we had been shipmates for years . Our skipper was Curtis Arnall , who had owned his own cruising cutter on the Sound . He had the advantage over the rest of us because he knew navigation and could take sights with a sextant . Somewhere he had learned Morse code too and could use flags for wigwag . So he rated his Chief Bosun 's Mate insignia . He had been an actor as well as a yachtsman , and just before he volunteered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of Buck Rogers on the radio program . Then there was Joe Choate , our exec , a tall quiet fellow with thin sandy hair , who had worked for the Guaranty Trust Company before he joined up . Joe had had a lot of practical experience knocking around offshore waters in his own sloop and on other sailing vessels . He was nuts about sail ; they say he turned down a chance for a lieutenant 's commission because he was afraid he 'd get stuck on land . One of the crew that everyone took a shine to was a Bridgeport boy named Toivo Koskinen , whom we all called George . George had been everything from a boilermaker to a longshoreman , and for a couple of years before joining up had been half owner of an oyster boat . He knew all the tricks about sail and power , could tie knots faster than any of us , couldsplice wire and rope so you could n't worry it loose with a sailor 's awl unless you put your mind to it . And he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling himself hand over hand up the shrouds to the spreaders . Two of the crew had left college to enlist . One of them was a Larehmont boy named Edward Jobson , who had just completed his freshman year at Williams . Jobbie was the youngest of the crew , but not youngest in windjammer experience . In fact Jobbie had sailed as crew on Zaida back in the peaceful days when Mr. Ratsey always kept two hired hands aboard to do the dirty work and supply all the little touches that keep a ship bright with spit and polish . Jobbie carried on in the same manner . Whenever he was off watch he 'd start puttering around the deck with a cloth or would be worrying a halyard into a nicer coil so it would run free without snarling . The other college youngster was Ward Weimer , a medical student who had just finished his undergraduate work at Dartmouth . Ward did n't look much like a sailor . He had long thin hands that seemed to be more fitted for an artist . He planned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour . When he got going on limericks , some of them pretty hot , he would chant one after the other to the old " Turili-Urili " tune . Naturally he had charge of our first aid kit . The only other member of the crew who had been with us from the beginning was an Irish New Englander , short , fat , and talkative , named Vance Smith . Before he came to Grcenport he had been doing some Auxiliary patrolling of harbor and inlet waters around Swampscott ; and if there was one subject Vance knew better than sail it was sea . His experience was n't just the kind you 'd pick up by being in the Marblehead yacht races year after year . He had plenty of that , but he also had the uncanny extra sense of sight and smell that Massachusetts fishermen have , knowing what the wind smells like when it gets in a certain direction , how the currents set , why the water looks different at different times , and somehow being able to put all that information together and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was bothered most by some of the skipper 's peculiarities . For instance , the skipper seemed to feel obliged to keep himself apart from his crew , which would be all right aboard a larger ship but not aboard Zaida , where everyone had to eat and sleep in close quarters . He never let anyone else take or send any messages over the radio telephone , night or day , though he must have known how eager we all were to get the chance . He handled all the details of navigation by himself , taking sextant readings , consulting his tables , and recording his findings on the chart by lines and crosses . He never dated the crosses , never explained to anyone else how close his plot came to the dead-reckoning position . That got on Smitty 's nerves , and he would often clomp down the companionway to study the chart and wonder out loud whether we were on station or not . There were other beefs we had too ? all of them petty , but cumulative . By the time we set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us had asked to be transferred to other ships ? but our requests had been turned down . There were three men who had been with us only a short time , all somewhat older than the rest of us . One was a Brooklyn taxi driver , Ted Carlson , who had seen some pretty hard life during his forty-one years ; but religion and vegetarianism had got him somewhere along the way . When he was off watch he would sit in the cabin with his Bible in his hands , reading his daily assignment . He did n't have any particular aptitude aboard ship . He did what had to be done but he did n't seem to take any pleasure in it . Another of the older men was Arnold Windsor , forty years old , who had owned a thirty-foot sailboat for some years . He was a handy man at the wheel and capable at odd jobs like splicing and rigging sail . He had a knack for marlinespike seamanship in general , kept the ends of ropes whipped , and sewed up seams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for anything it was pretty safe to assume that Windsor had it . Jim Watson was the third of the newer men , and he was quite a character . Hewas short and slight of build , wiry and quick in his actions . He had been a fisherman off the Grand Banks for many years and had also gone farther north , hunting seal . On those sealing cruises his ship would be out during several months of winter weather . He did n't talk easily , but when he was on watch different things would get him started and he 'd tell about the time a ship capsized on a reef , broke up , and all hands were lost ; or about the time his crew brought back the captain dead and kept him on ice until he could be handed over to the undertaker . Pleasant tales to pass the long hours of night watch . III A t. the men , new and old , seemed to have some misgivings about the patrol that started just after Thanksgiving , 1942 . It was partly the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good fall days were clone , and Zaida was n't exactly designed for winter service . We had stepped a little pot-bellied cast-iron stove fast to the bulkhead between cabin and galley , and had used it enough to find it would burn blocks of pressed coal in fine style when we were on a starboard tack . When we came about on a port tack the wind blew down the vent and filled the cabin with smoke . But it was better than nothing and worked pretty welt when we were hove to on station . As we headed out for our station there was the usual kind of banter , but there did n't seem to he so much of it . Once past Montauk , we found that the sea was building up , and for the next five days the sea ran unusually high . First one fellow would be sick , then another . By the next to the last day of our patrol all of us had been sick enough to make us look forward with extra eagerness to solid land and a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been relieved we got a message from the base advising us to proceed several miles on an easterly course to investigate a possible submarine contact . That was n't very good news for us because it meant that we should have to beat back to our station in the teeth of winds that threatened to reach gale strength . But we set more sail and proceeded to the rendezvous , several miles off station . While we were out there another message came over the radio : small-craft storm warning . There were jeers and violent language from the listeners aboard Zaida . A helluva time to find that out ! What landlubber was in charge of weather predictions , and how far inland was his station ? " Shut up and listen , " someone shouted . The message continued : the wind might build up to 30 knots . No ! Not really ! Somebody called up to the men on watch in the cockpit and asked them to estimate the present wind velocity . Silence . Then , " About 35 to 40 . " Maybe we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time . Seine of us were a little worried to see the way the northwest wind made us sail , even with sails backed . Zaida seemed to make too much headway , and the combination of wind and current might set us in toward every sailor 's dread ? a Tee share . We asked the skipper , but as usual he kept his thoughts pretty much to himself . We knew he could n't say exactly where we were because he had n't been able to use his sextant for more than twenty-four hours , and the radio-direction-finder was out of order . All that afternoon the hairy clouds racing low across the ocean shut out the sun , and all that night there were no stars . It looked as though we were in for trouble . That next morning , December 3rd , was the end of our patrol and we kept near the radio phone , hoping to hear an early clearmessage from the Picket Boat sent to relieve us . The longer we waited and listened the stronger the wind blew and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not sailed ; in that case we should be told . Growling and nervousness increased among the crew . After a while the skipper said that if the storm kept building that way we might have to stay put long enough to ride it out . There were groans from the seasick boys who had taken beating enough . Then the voice came over the loudspeaker . The shore station again , calling in all Coastal Picket boats because of an expected blow that might build up to 35knots before the end of the day . So what ? We estimated that the wind was already stronger than that . Zaida was bouncing through rollers and chop like a cockleshell , and water kept coming over the fo'castic head in drenching sheets . When the yawl put her bowsprit under , the spray drove aft and soaked the lookout and the man at the wheel . If we started for the base we should have to beat into heavy seas just enough off the wind to make the going tricky , even under power of the little auxiliary engine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow better . Jobbie was at the wheel , and from the way he kept licking spray off his lips , spitting and swearing , we knew he was having enough trouble keeping the seas head on . As each roller started to lift the bow Jobbie would put the helm down slightly and ease the yawl up to the crest , then ease her off a bit and slide down the roller into the trough . It seemed enough to ask of anyone , just keeping the nervous little lady up into the wind without trying to go anywhere in particular . The only trouble with that was the possibility that we were already so far northeast of our station that we might be getting into shoal water . Srnitty said so first . He pointed to the nasty water off the starboard beam and said the whitish color was sand being churned up from the bottom . It certainly looked like it . When Smitty went below and told the skipper we were in shoal water the skipper brushed him off flatly with a disgusted , " Nonsense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argue with God or the devil , and he started trying to convince the skipper . Words grew hotter and hotter . Joe Choate tried to shut Smitty up , but he had to admit that Srnitty might be right . The upshot of it was that all three of them began a little parade between the chart shelf and the cockpit . Smitty argued that we must be on Nantucket Shoals and in danger of capsizing ; the skipper said we were well south of Martha 's Vineyard ? perhaps as much as twenty miles south of No Man 's Land . At last Smitty made the skipper admit that wherever we were , that funnycolored water meant we were in trouble and would need help . Back they climbed over the coaming of the companionway hatch , and the skipper turned on the radio phone while Smitty bent over the chart . Pretty soon the skipper began calling the shore station , and when he got an answer he stated that we were in need of assistance , that our position was about twenty miles south of No Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the chart in disgust , was suddenly thrown by an unexpected pitch and roll of the yawl . His face hit the edge of the metal bulkhead , and he fell forward with a crash on the cabin deck . There he lay , stunned a little , with both hands over his face . We pulled and hauled until we had him up on a bunk . The sharp edge of the bulkhead had done a mean job . Blood ran from an ugly gash in his forehead , his nose was flattened and broken , and there was a hole in his upper lip as though his teeth had been driven through . Ward Weimer got out his first aid kit and started mopping and patching with bandages and adhesive tape , while the rest of us just stood helpless and watched . After Ward was through we put Smitty in one of the leeward bunks and lashed him in with sail stops so he would n't get thrown . He had been seasick the day before , and this new mess did n't help him any . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the storm kept building up toward a sixty-knot gale , Zaida had more and more trouble . The violent gusts made the long mainmast bend like a whip ; the stays and shrouds whistled and screamed , the heavy storm trys'l slatted and snapped until a torn hole appeared in the Tuff at the foot of the sail . To make matters worse , water seemed to be leaking into the bilges from somewhere , and that scared us . We took up some floorboards in the cabin deck and bailed with buckets because the deck pump worked so slowly . Smitty gave us the creeps by talking like a Calamity Jane from his bunk and saying he was sure the seams had opened . Watson , who had been tinkering with the busted radiodirection-finder , said the spray beating down through the companionway hatch had soaked it just enough to throw it out of kilter . So he braced himself against the locker beside the little pot-bellied stove and held the heavy machine in his arms to get it dried out . Iv R ouT noon calamity hit us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the awful sound of tearing canvas , the sharp cracking and flapping of loose ends , and shouts for help from Jobbie and Carlson on watch . We found out afterward . The shackle had carried away at the head of the storm trys ' 1 , the tracks came down in a stream of sparks ; the slacked-off , billowing canvas had burst out of its bolt ropes . Before anyone could do anything , the yawl fell off the wind until she was caught broadside in the trough of the heavy seas ; then the next breaker , a big one , towered over helpless Zaida like a beach swell swamping a toy boat . The breaker crashed and Zaida keeled over on her portside with a groaning clatter . Her tilted deck was completely buried under a great sheet of green water that seemed powerful enough to send her to the bottom of the ocean . But as the breaker passed over she staggered back and righted herself , then lurched violently to starboard . She was hurt but still afloat . Down below , the crew were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the starboard side were thrown bodily across the cabin to port , then thrown back against the starboard bunks . Before they could pull themselves together a flood of water crashed down the companionway hatch , lifted the skipper off his feet , and swept him on hands and knees all the way through the cabin to the galley . The heavy table , wrenched loose from the cabin deck with floorboards and all , smashed itself against the bulkhead over Ward Weimer 's bunk . Two men were badly hurt , but we did n't know it at the time . Watson , caught with the heavy radio-direction-finder on his lap , was thrown solidly against a lower portsidc bunk , and while he was down the pot-bellied stove tore loose and bounced down on top of him . Joe Choate had just come off watch and was lying on one of the lower starboard bunks . When Zaida went over , Joe was tossed clear across the cabin and landed with a thud against the solid port handrail secured to the cabin overhead . He struck on his forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his left eyebrow straight up into his hair . The rest of us were tossed into crazy positions , all in a heap together , with blankets , heavy-weather gear , boots , books , and personal effects piled on top of us . We all fought to get untangled from the mess , because the water was soon sloshing around the cabin a good foot deep , and we thought we were sinking . Clouds of smoke and steam filled the cabin as the water met the fire in the pot-bellied stove . As soon as we could get on our feet we scrambled for the deck . It seemed certain that Jobbie and Carlson must have been swept overboard . But they were n't . Jobbic was hanging over the wheel , gulping and pointing off to le'ward . We looked and saw our precious yellow life raft bobbing along like a cork on the chop . It had been washed out of its cradle atop the cabin overhead . We could n't do anything about it . Carlson , draped over one corner of the cockpit , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had carried away just above the gooseneck ; the shrouds still held fast , so the sail and broken mast were dragging in the water . While George was cutting the useless mast free with an axe , Joe Choate bellowed at us to form a bucket brigade . We piled down the companionway , hauled out pans from the galley , and settled down to almost two solid hours of bailing . The more we bailed the more we had to bail . The following seas broke over the taffrail as we ran before the wind , and water pouring into the cockpit drained partially into the engine room and the head , then into the cabin . After a long time we had the water down below the level of the cabin deck . To keep it there more bailing was done every hour or two . While we were bailing we saw the cut on Joe Choate 's head , and the stream of blood that kept trickling down his face as he crouched over the hatch in the cabin deck . After a while he grew so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exhausted . Ward said stitches would have to be taken ; better not touch it now . So we eased him into his bunk and lashed him there with more sail stops . Joe just lay there quietly sopping up the bloodwith towels until it clotted and stopped . Poor Watson was hurt worst of all . He said he knew he had some ribs broken because he heard them crack when the direction-finder and the pat-bellied stove hit him . He was in serious pain , but Ward did n't have anything to give him except aspirin . By the time we had him patched up and lashed in his bunk the cabin looked like quite a little sick hay . By the middle of that afternoon it seemed that help was in sight . A big Army bomber started circling above us and blinking some kind of message at us with a light . The skipper went on deck with the Aldis lamp and answered . Before he could blink off much of a message the big plane leveled off and disappeared in the haze . We expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before long , and that would be the end of our troubles . All of us dreaded the approaching dusk because we had no idea how far out to sea we might be blown if no rescue came before darkness set in . But it grew darker and darker until we could n't even see the bowsprit as we sat in the cockpit . We tried to keep a bright lookout , but the wind blew colder and colder until snow began to drive hard in our faces like frozen rain . If only we could keep from capsizing again we might get things back into some kind of shape ; might even patch up sail and start beating back toward shore . But it was a long night , cold ? and black as a pocket . Meanwhile at Headquarters of the Commander Eastern Sea Frontier in New York word had been received that CGR-3070 and other Coastal Pickets were in distress ; and , in spite of the bad weather , Army and Navy planes and Coast Guard cutters had been rent out to locate the ships and help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported having located the 3070 some thirty-five miles east of the position she had reported . A Navy bomber later reported hazing seen her being blown farther and farther out to sea . These messages were relayed to the nearest Coast Guard cutler , but she had her hands full already towing another battered Picket home through heavy seas . Two other vessels were immediately ordered to the rescue , one of them from Newport and the other from Boston . V WERE a sorry sight by the next morning ? the morning of December 4th . The gale was still blowing ; the tattered canvas was slatting ; the cabin was a shambles . We had some spare canvas but we could n't risk breaking it out until the wind died down a bit . There was n't much we could do . Smitty and George went to work on the generator , which would n't start because there was so much water in the gasoline . They strained the gas through a piece of cloth , a little at a time , and finally got enough to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which we had pretty nearly drained of juice sending out distress messages over the radio phone . Meanwhile some of us fooled with the sea anchor , trying to slow up our speed . Just before we capsized we had had it all rigged and ready to use . But it gave way when we went over , wrapped the line round the stern , and then swung around to the bow . We hauled it in by the tripline and after we were running under bare poles before the wind we put it out astern . The trouble with that was that it reduced our speed so much that the following seas came over the taffrail into the cockpit . Then the men on watch would let out a bellow and we would run up to help bail like fury because water in the cockpit kept running down into the head and into the cabin . Then we 'd have to start bailing the bilges out again . Not long before noon that day the lookout spotted a ship about four miles dead astern . The weather was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could n't tell what she was . But she kept coming along on a course that would take her by on our port side . We were sure she was a rescue vessel , and everyone started whooping and slapping backs . At first she looked like a PC , then she was too large for that , and we decided she was a cutter . As she got closer she looked like a destroyer ; but somehow was n't just right . Smitty had been sleeping through all the excitement , but we woke him up and he came up on deck . He took the glasses and squinted for a while , then handed themover to somebody else and started swearing . " She 's a Limey destroyer , " Smitty said . " She wo n't stop . " Down he went to get some flares . He was still below when the destroyer came alongside , and damned if Smitty was n't right . We could see men on her deck looking us over , but she went right past , knifing her way through heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to holler and wave our arms over our heads . Before Smitty brought up the flares she had started to come about . She swung in a wide half-circle , headed up into the wind , and closed us on our starboard side . When she was near enough a British voice sl. ' sited over and asked what we wanted . The skipper shouted back that we had some injured men aboard , that we had been capsized the day before and had lost our storm trys'l . The destroyer plowed upwind quite a way , to think it over , I guess . A snow squall came up and we lost sight of her . After a while she came back alongside and asked the skipper what he wanted to do . The skipper had been pretty upset by the whole thing , but it was plain that what he wanted most to do was to get the yawl back to port . He said only one man was badly hurt ; that we were n't leaking much , if at all . Then the destroyer payed off again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all for abandoning aida . Watson was so anxious to get off that he said he 'd rather take a chance of jumping overboard and being thrown a line than of staying on the yawl . Joe wanted to stick ; he said he thought the destroyer could tow us in . Apparently the destroyer captain decided to take us aboard , because he rigged a crash net on the purtside aft and then started edging upwind toward us again . But with the seas pitching both of us round in different directions , it was no go . In that sea it would have been the end of the yawl if the destroyer had smacked against her . The net seemed to get fouled in the destroyer 's propeller , and they had quite a job getting it inboard again . After a couple of tries the officer in command on the destroyer said he could n't take us off but he 'd shoot us a towline . Under those conditions it 's no fun to secure a tow at sea . They shot a line across our bow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time they tried something blew up in the gun and the line fouled . The next shot was perfect , and the line fell right across our bow . But before we could haul in the hawser Zaida yawed on the crest of a wave and the Iine parted over the bowsprit . So they tried another tack . They bent the line on something like a life preserver and floated it down to us . That would have worked all right if the destroyer could have stayed in one place . She had to keep some headway to be controllable , and she would keep running past us before we could hook the line and draw it in . After several tries they hauled the life preserver aboard , went downwind from us , and started pumping heavy black bunker oil on the water to see if they could smooth the seas down a bit for us . We could see the great patch of oil getting closer and closer , but it did n't seem to have much effect . After a while it was all around us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fun , the seas kept breaking over the taffrall , and the deck of the yawl was covered with the slimy grease . It sloshed into the cockpit , and we got it all over our cold-weather gear . We began tracking it down into the cabin , and as men got exhausted from slipping round on deck , they went below for rest and stretched out on the mattresses , oil and all . Some of the stuff got into the bilges , and all the rest of the cruise we had that smell of bunker oil to remind us of the Limeys . But it worked enough to get the line aboard . After about eight tries they got the line near enough for us to haul it in with the boathook . Then we kept taking it up until we got the heavy tow hawser , secured it to the mast , ran it forward to the chock and over the bow . We waved an OK , and they began taking up the slack slowly . By that time we were all so wet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we would n't have a tow very long in that weather unless some sort of chafing gear was rigged to protect it , and lie got Carlson to help him . For some reason George crawled out on the bowsprit to secure the chafing gear . He was justabout done when a big sea caught him wrong , and he slipped . The force of the sea broke the hold he had with his feet , and he was washed completely over the side . As he lost his balance on the bowsprit he had kept his feet locked together , and for a split second he swung head downward , reaching for the heavy chain bobstay . Then the water tore him loose and threw him against the bow . Carlson said afterward that he had heard about the fear in people 's eyes when they are being swept overboard , but the only look on George 's face was one of disgust . For a second or two he disappeared completely from sight , and Carlson thought he was a goner . Then a big roller lifted him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He reached for the wire life line , caught it , and pulled himself aboard . It all happened so fast that Carlson did n't even have time to pray . George was all right . When he came dripping into the cabin the first thing he said was , " Well , boys , I 've had a bath today , and that 's more than any of you bastards can say . " That happened just before dark . The destroyer increased her speed slowly and in a little while we were slamming through the night . The scas would spank against the bow with a thud , as though the water were made of cement . And then the stern , hauled over the crest , would sit down so hard the thud would jar your teeth . We worried to hear and feel the beating that Zaida was taking . But she plowed on through everything that came , hour after hour , and nothing happened . On deck it was so dark we could just barely see a blue light on the stern of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her was lost . Someone asked where we were headed , and for the first time we remembered we had n't asked . Maybe we would wind up in Scotland for our next port of call . At least the worst was over , we said , and the rest did n't matter very much . But the worst had just begun . About midnight there was a jolt and we began to lase headway . It was as though someone had put on the brakes and we were skidding to a stop . The men on watch went forward and hauled on the towline . It was broken off clean , just forward of the bow . The chafing gear had worn through . We could n't see the destroyer , and could n't tell whether she knew she had lost us . The blue light on her stern had often been hidden by low clouds and snow squalls . Of course there was the chance that she would turn and look for us . We put on our spreader lights , pretty dim because of the weak batteries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there was no use of shouting against wind and seas . Nothing came of it . You could tell by the faces of the crew that everyone was pretty low . There we were , on our own again , perhaps a hundred miles out to sea , with sails in bad shape , one mast gone , water in the gas , salt water in the fresh water , two injured men lashed in their bunks , and that stinking oil all over everything . All night long the wind kept driving us south and east through squall after squall . It was freezing cold , and that solid darkness out there in the middle of nowhere was worse than the cold . If the destroyer circled in that weather , visibility was so bad she might run us down before she saw us . We tried to keep sharp watch , but the snow stungour eyes and half blinded us . We kept hoping for daylight , but it was a long way off . At Headquarters in New York , shortly after one o'clock on the afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British destroyer Caldwell reporting 3070 's position and condition . Orders went out immediately to a gunboat out of Boston to proceed to the scene and take the yawl in tow . A few hours later another message came from Caldwell saying she had 3070 in tow and was proceeding to Halifax . The gunboat was ordered to change course , and messages were exchanged arranging for the two ships to rendezvous at sea the following day so that Caldwell might be relieved of the tow . Then , shortly before midnight , came word that the tow had parted . Careful search plans were worked out , to begin with daylight . The Army agreed to have eleven bombers extend their daily sweep to participate in the search ; groups of Navy FBI planes were assigned to comb designated areas ; fourteen Canadian planes on patrol out of Nova Scotia were alerted . All surface vessels known to be in the area were asked to keep bright lookouts . For four days this vast search continued without success . There was no word of Zaida . The concluding installment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be published in the next issue of the maga.ine . The Editors
