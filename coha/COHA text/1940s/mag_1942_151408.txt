A woman has learned how to paint pictures that will last forever-or at least 1,000 years-but now she ca n't paint them any more . For ten years tall , dark-eyed , strikingly chic Chicago socialite Buell Mullen crusaded for an art new-fashioned to fit a chromium , copper and aluminum age and developed a method of painting on metal . Now she has only enough war metal on hand to see her through this year . A mural commissioned by International Business Machines has been shelved for the duration , because neither she nor the company cares to ask for a priority on the necessary steel . She can still paint on silver and gold , but hopes technological strides will release less expensive materials . <P> The metal method was evolved through rigorous experimentation . Mrs. Mullen left her paintings out in snowstorms , stowed them in damp places , cooked them on hot radiators , to see how they would take it . Using a surface prepared by etching and acid , with tested paints and finishes , she learned how to accomplish a sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's results are rarely as heroic as her efforts . Already on their way to the 1,000-year-distant scrap heap are her portraits of Conductor Eugene Ormandy in chromium ; Governor Herbert Lehman in britannia , Nelson Eddy in aluminum , General John Pershing ( in stainless steel on the observation car of Burlington 's General Pershing Zephyr ) . She has done others in pewter , gold , brass , glass and wood . Recently at the Naval Academy at Annapolis , Navy officials dedicated her stainless steel murals Hong Kong Harbor and London Pool-two great scenes of British shipping . <P> Luminosity , precision , an illusion of floating through flawless air are effects she strives for and sometimes gets in the new medium . Her Naval Academy murals are excellent . A portrait of Mrs. Mullen 's son on a tricycle , on view in the window of Chicago 's Findlay Galleries , once slowed up traffic considerably on Michigan Avenue . There have been other unreckoned results . <P> People who look at her portraits are apt to find themselves disconcertingly in the picture , by reflection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Mullen concedes with reluctance that her material is now matriel . She says sadly : " If people would realize that a sheet of 10-gauge steel 6 by 18 ft. would only make one and one-half inches of battleship plate , and even then it 's too thin to be of any use ! . . .
