 | It frightened me , but more than anything it exasperated me . " All right , " I snapped . " Go ahead and tell them you murdered him ! That 's exactly what it will amount to . Or shall I tell them ? Craig may come to see you in jail but I doubt it . " " Sarah . . . " There 's a time for nobility , Drue Cable , but this is n't the time . However , if you 're bent on making a martyr of yourself I wo n't stop you . Heaven knows it 's nothing to me . You make me come here ; I did n't know I was walking into anything like this . I hate shooting and I hate murder and I hate the police . I 'm going home . Unless they stop me . You can do exactly as you please . Just go ahead and tell them you killed him and I do n't care , for I wo n't be here . " " Sarah . . . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kind of fool . " " Oh , yes , you are . I can see it . . . " " No . No . " Her hands dropped away from my arms . She stared down at the dressing table with its rosy little lamp and crystal bottles . " I wo n't tell them . I can not believe that he was murdered . I saw him . Yet if  --  oh , you 're right , of course . " " Certainly , I 'm right . " I paused thoughtfully . There was only one thing we could do and it had its dangers . Yet they had already mentioned digitalis ; and it was a piece of material evidence really leading to Drue . " Did you use all the supply of digitalis you had , Drue ? " " No . Only enough ... " " We ought to get rid of the rest of it . " " But Sarah , when  --  if I eventually tell them about it , as I may have to do . . . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it 's better to get rid of the rest of the digitalis now in the hope it need n't ever come out  --  about the hypodermic , I mean . Some blundering fool " ( which was exactly the opposite  | of what I meant ) " of a policeman might get his hands on the digitalis ; Chivery may see the hypodermic mark . No , no , Drue , it 's better to dispose of the rest of the digitalis now . I 'll do it ... " " No , " she said quickly and sharply and then caught herself as quickly . " I 'd better do it myself , " she said . " I know exactly where it is . I 'll go . Now . " So she went , leaving me oddly perplexed by the look of sudden and sharp anxiety in her face . It was as if she had remembered something she did n't want me to know about  --  which was nonsense , of course . What could there be in her room , in the little nursing bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep a secret ? When presently she came back , slipping quietly into the room while I was sitting beside Craig , I had decided it was nothing . " Did you get it ? " I whispered . Her face looked very white and her breath was canting quickly ; her hand was in her pocket . She shook her head . " They were already there . They . . . Sarah  --  they 've got your little black bag  --  you know ; and mine . I saw a policeman go downstairs with them . Oh , Sarah ... " We stared at each other across Craig 's bed , and rain whispered against the windows . Finally , I said  --  I had to say , " Never mind . It does n't prove anything . Do n't worry . " After that there was really nothing we could do . We did n't even talk much . The rain beat and murmured against the windows and all we could do was wait . Digitalis . And they had thought of us , nurses , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before they could possibly have got results from the autopsy . I did n't like that , but I did n't tell Drue ( although she knew it , naturally ) , and Craig slept and the rain beat down and there was no way of knowing what the police were doing . What Alexia was doing and Nicky , or Maud . Waiting , too , I imagined , as we were waiting .  | I could n't then , even , try to discover the syringe . If the person who had found it in the fern ( who must have seen me place it there ) had taken it to the police then we were already lost . But if not there might be some chance . If it was murder , then who ? Who had shot Craig ? Who had killed his father ? I had ensconced myself on the couch in front of the fire by that time , feeling that since we could accomplish nothing by further talk , Drue and I , I might as well try to get some sleep . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head like a nightmarish kind of merrygo-round  --  Alexia , Nicky , Maud , Peter Huber , Dr. Chivery ( for he was not in the house , but he was fairly near presumably , and could have returned somehow without anyone 's knowledge ) , Beevens , Anna  --  the other servants . Just as I was about to catch the tail of a nap I began to think again of the telephone call to the police . Who had called them ? And more important  --  tremendously important  --  why ? In that answer , I thought suddenly , with that queerly elusive clarity one discovers on the edge of sleep , might lie the answer to the whole ugly problem . After that I was wide awake for what was left of the night . Craig slept heavily and seemed none the worse for his mysterious peregrinations ; Drue sat in an armchair near the bed with her starched cap off and her hair a little rumpled from pressing her head back against the cushions of the chair  --  her face pale , her eyes very dark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night , rain and sleet and rain again . We could hear nothing of what was going on in the house . Twice I got up and tiptoed into the hall , once going down the stairs , pausing again at the fern . But the syringe was really gone . The hall below was deserted , but Nicky Senour and Peter Huber were sitting in the morning room in front of the fire , smoking . There were state troopers in the library ; I went down into the hall and as far as the library  | door . No one stopped me and I wanted to see what they were doing . I was little wiser for my pains but convinced , if I had not been before , that they were in earnest about an investigation . For they had been taking fingerprints from smooth surfaces in the room ; they had been using a tiny hand vacuum on furniture and rugs ; the decanter of brandy had been removed ; there were chalked crosses on the sofa and on the rug indicating , I thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been taken , then . But the body of Conrad Brent had been removed . Two troopers were still there , one of them writing shorthand notes rapidly in a little tablet ; the other blowing a small cloud of yellowish powder from a contrivance that looked like a tiny bellows upon one of the wooden panels across the room on the right side of the fireplace ? a panel that I saw then , was actually a swinging door leading into a tiny washroom , for I could see walls tiled in shining , pale green beyond . He turned to look at me and the trooper with the tablet stopped writing to look at me , too , and there being , to say the least , no welcome in either look but rather the contrary , I retreated ; anyway I had seen all I wanted to see . Nicky looked up as I passed through the hall but did not stop me . Peter however came out . " Have you told Craig ? " he asked me . " No . " " Better not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Huber ? You remember ? while you were calling the doctor . Did you find out about it ? " He frowned ; his face looked tired and worried . " I did n't find anybody , " he said . " I guess I 'm not much of a detective . From the sound I thought a window had been broken somewhere , but I was wrong . I looked all along the hall leading toward the back of the house . But I found just nothing to account for it . "  | " Could there have been some  --  some intruder ? A thief , perhaps ? " Peter Huber shrugged . " I do n't know . I 'll tell the police about it . I take it Craig is all right ? " " Oh , yes . " " They took him away  --  Conrad Brent , I mean . I suppose they are doing an autopsy now . " Nicky watched , bright eyes intensely curious , as I took my way upstairs again . That must have been about four or five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By six 1 o'clock Craig had n't wakened . At about seven Beevens , clothed in his right mind as well as trousers and dark sack coat , brought Drue and me some coffee and toast . Breakfast would be along soon , he said ; in the meantime he thought we might enjoy the coffee . He spoke to me and looked at Drue with a kind of sympathy and kindliness ; naturally all the servants knew of her posi tion in that household . Perhaps the romance of it appealed to them , but I think they liked her , too . Beevens could tell us nothing , though , of what the police were doing and , looking very haggard himself with great puffs under his eyes , went away . After we drank the coffee and I ) rue nibbled at some toast because I made her , I sent her to her room . Sometime that day she would have to face the police and she 'd had no sleep at all that night . So I made her rest ; and thus I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly ; in full possession of his senses . He looked white and tired , but his pulse was good . He had no temperature and the wound in his shoulder , while stiff and sore , seemed to be healing with normal rapidity . He said almost at once , " Where is Drue ? " " In her room , resting . " He looked at me , frowning a little . He was very sober , and there was a kind of authority about him . All at once  | I seemed to see a very faint likeness to his father  --  his nose , perhaps , and brown , decided chin . His eyes , however , were darker and had spirit and luminousness . His father 's eyes had been very cold and chill . He said , " You 're the other nurse . Yes , I remember you . " " I 'm Sarah Keate . I 'll ring for some breakfast . I think you can manage something light . . . . He interrupted me . " Listen , Nurse , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . " I did not hesitate . " Nothing happened , except that you got out of bed once when I was out of the room and got a bump . . . " He put his hand to his bandaged temple . " Why , yes , " he said . " I remember that ! But something had happened downstairs . Somebody screamed . You left and I  --  I got up to see what it was . I put on slippers and a robe and . . . " he stopped . There was a sudden and clear recollection in his eyes . I said , " And you fell . . . " and he said , shaking his head , " No . Somebody hit me . " " Somebody . . . " I stopped with a kind of gulp . He gave me a look of annoyance . " Do n't gargle , " he said briefly . " B-but you said . . . " " Certainly I said somebody hit me . Somebody did . I was just at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and I turned and that 's all . Just as I turned it hit and I went out like a light . I remember that . " Suddenly and completely I believed him . His look and his voice were perfectly clear and rational . I said , after a moment , " Who ? " " I do n't know . I tell you that 's all I remember except later  --  a long time later  --  Drue was here . " His voice when he said her name changed subtly , so it was grave and yet somehow warm and tender , as if it spoke a loved name . But he had left her and had let her shift for herself , with-  | out ever a word from him . A nurse 's life is not an easy one . I hardened my heart against him . All at once he caught my wrist in a quick , impatient grip . " But what happened ? Who screamed ? " So I told him . I would have evaded but I could n't . I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excite him unnecessarily . I did it as gently and as kindly as I could , and I reminded him that his father had had a bad heart condition apparently for years . I also said it had been quick . I did n't mention the police or Drue or the digitalis . When I had told him I went to the window and stood there , my back to the room , looking out at the gray daylight . After a long time he called me . " Yes ? " " Thanks . .. " " It  --  it was n't unexpected , " I said again . " And it was mercifully quick . " " Yes ; yes  --  I ' 11 see the doctor when he comes , Nurse . " " Certainly . " He had n't asked again about Drue 's scream , and I was thankful for it . He let me wash his face and ring to order breakfast . Anna answered the bell . " I 'm sorry , Mr. Craig , " she said , her eyes filling with tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry . " He patted her hand a little , kindly , and she went quickly away . Almost at once Alexia came . I was straightening the bed and thought . it was Anna . Alexia was in the room before I realized it was not . She had dressed and wore a sleek black chess with white lace at her throat and small wrists . She came quickly to the bed and knelt there . " Craig , they 've told you . . . " He looked at her for a moment without replying . There was a queer look on his face  --  a kind of grimness all at once that , again , made me think of his father yet was totally unlike , too , for it held sensibility , or concealed  | it , where his father 's look was only obstinate and a little cruel . Alexia put one arm across him so her hand on the bed supported her and leaned very close to him . Her mouth was lightly lipsticked that morning and looked very tender and tremulous in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dark hair was a soft frame for her creamy , small face with its delicate features . She said , " I 'm sorry , Craig . He was your father . " Craig 's eyes narrowed . " He was your husband , Alexia . " Her face did n't change , unless her eyelids lowered a little ; but I could see the curving lines of her body stiffen slightly . She said rather slowly , very musically , looking into Craig 's eyes , " I never needed to be reminded of that . You know that , Craig , better than anyone . " There was a short silence . I prepared to remove the top blanket and thus oust Alexia , but as I moved to do so she said , " It 's horrible  --  the police and all , I mean ! They found the revolver in Drue 's room . " " Drue ! What do you mean ? What about the police ? What revolver ? " " Really , Mrs. Brent , I 'll have to ask you to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hurrying forward , my starchy uniform rattling . Alexia silenced both of us . " Do n't try to think , my darling , " she said , putting her face against Craig 's . " Oh , Craig , you knew  --  you always knew I never loved Conrad . And now all that is ended for us both , my darling . " Over her shoulder Craig 's eyes plunged into mine . " For God 's sake , what does she mean ? What revolver ? " he cried urgently .  | 9 WELL , I could n't have told him even if I 'd known , I was so livid and gibbering with rage . I put my hand on Alexia 's shoulder and may have taken a tighter grip even than I intended , for she wrenched het-sell away from me with a rather startled look and got quickly to her feet , clasping her shoulder with her other hand . " Nurse , you forget yourself ! How dare you touch . . . " " What revolver , Alexia ? " demanded Craig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retreated behind those soft , satiny eyelids . She said breathlessly , " Conrad 's revolver . It was in Drue 's room . The police found it . " Craig was as white as the billow , and I intended to put Alexia out of the room by slicer physical force if nothing else sufficed . He said , " But he was n't shot ! " " No ! He was n't shot , " I said quickly . " He died of a heart attack , just as I told you . Now then , Mrs. Brent ... " " But the police , " said Craig . " Why are they here ? " " Someone called them . " Alexia answered him . " No one knows who . But someone got on the telephone just after Conrad died and told the police your father had  | been murdered . So they came , and they are going to investigate his death . . . . " " Murder ! " said Craig . " But that 's impossible ! " He made a motion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned even whiter . Peter Huber knocked , entered quickly , stopped as quickly as he seemed to sense something electric in the atmosphere and then said , " It 's only ? well , they want you downstairs , Alexia . Right away . They are waiting . You too , Nurse Keate . " His eyes went past us to Craig , and he said , " You 've told him ? " Behind him on the threshold Anna appeared with the tray . " I 'm not going , " I said . " I 'm on duty . " " Is it the police , Peter ? " asked Craig . Peter Huber nodded . " Craig , I 'm sorry about your father . . . . " Craig closed his eyes as if to shut out talk of that . " Yes , Pete , " he said . There was a little silence while Anna went to the bed with the tray and I followed her . Craig looked up at me . " Go on down , " he said . " Anna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got to know . . . . " I 'll tell you , Craig . I 'll tell you everything the police do . " Alexia started toward the bed , stopped as I straightened up rather abruptly from adjusting the pillows and looked hard at her , said softly to Craig , " Do n't think , darling . Do n't try to think now . I 'll be back , " and went out the door . Peter came to the bed and Craig said again to me , " Please go downstairs , Miss Keate . I want you to tell me everything they do . . . . " So in the end I went ; not because of the police , but merely to keep Craig 's temperature down . Anna stayed with him and Peter Huber , too , for a while , although they sent for him also before that morning 's long inquiry was over . It lasted nearly three hours . Three hours of steady questions and answers  --  statements , repetitions , explana  | tions , and probably a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no way of identifying those . It was already under way when I entered the little morning room , with its ivory woodwork , green and rose chintz , and blazing wood fire . Everyone except Craig , and for the moment , Peter , was there : Lieutenant Nugent and two troopers , very lean , and silent as their chief ; a man in gray , fat and rosycheeked with winking eyeglasses who proved to be the District Attorney ( so I knew , then , that they were sure it was murder ) ; Nicky ; and Alexia who was , subtly , a broken reed . Their two faces were so much alike , so secretive , so delicate and beautiful that it was as if one was the mirror of the other ; as if some deep affinity joined their very thoughts . Which , as a matter of fact , was very far from the truth . Maud was there , too , little and indomitable in sweeping black with her pompadour rising high above her narrow , sallow , little forehead , her collar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air , and her eyes brooding and angry , watching the police , watching Nicky and Alexia  --  watching even me , fixedly . I do n't think a move or a look or a quickened pulse escaped her eager , antlike eyes . Claud Chivery was n't there . Then I saw Drue ; she was sitting in a tall armchair , her hands around the arm of it , her white carp like a crown upon her shining hair . She was very pale ; her dark gray eyes had a kind of terrified stillness . I thought she tried to communicate with me , mutely , with her look , and I tried , mutely , to remind her of danger , and in the same fractional glance that I was on her side . So it was a rather complicated glance , I daresay ; certainly it did n't seem to accomplish anything in the way of improving the situation . Then I felt that somebody was watching us and turned . It was Lieutenant Nugent , his eyes narrow and thought  | ful , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fact , a bad sign . All through that interview he was as laconic as ever and when he was forced to say more than a few words did so with an air of positively grudging distaste and terseness . He said then , " Sit down , please , Nurse Keate . The District Attorney , Mr. Soper , wants to question you . " I sat down , and that long bout of questioning began for me . It began badly and ended badly . The first thing Soper said was a flat , bald statement to the effect that they had found enough digitalis in Conrad Brent 's blood stream to kill him , and they believed it was murder . From there they went on to that inevitable conclusion . They did it slowly , detail by detail , taking so much time at bypaths and crossroads , so to speak , that it was n't till the very end that I could look back and see that Soper , at any rate , had planned and charted his whole road to arrive at exactly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time ; they questioned me and I told them again exactly what I had already told Lieutenant Nugent , no more and no less . They questioned Maud and Nicky and Alexia ; they sent for and questioned Peter Huber ; they questioned everybody . Gradually the story built itself up  --  much of it by confirmation , for it was obvious that they had already done considerable , less public , questioning . Conrad Brent had spent the previous day about as other days were spent , except for his anxiety about his son , two or three morning visits to Craig 's room ( before Drue and I arrived ) and a talk with Dr. Chivery . This ( according to Maud ) was entirely about Craig 's condition . The Lieutenant already knew that Conrad had had an interview in his study with me and then with Drue after our arrival . I was questioned again about that almost immediately . It was about his son , I told them firmly , and  | that was all . There was a speculative look in Nicky 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maud said abruptly , " That is n't all , Lieutenant . Do n't forget that Conrad was furious because Drue Cable came here , and told her she had to leave . She was to go this morning . She . . . " " Yes , you told me that , " said Nugent . Drue 's lips parted a little and she leaned forward as if to speak , but Nugent did not permit her to do so . " Now , then , " he said briskly , " there were no callers yesterday except Dr. Chivery and myself . What about dinner ? " I could n't tell whether or not they had yet questioned Drue . It seemed logical that they had , but somehow I thought they had not and it seemed wrong  --  an ominous omission . They were replying , one and then another . The whole inquiry began to seem more and more like a formal assembling of already established facts . 1 ? xccpt for the impression I continued to have to the effect that Drue herself had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look more and more as if the already established facts had been established , so to speak , around her . When they did question her they would have a solid framework of evidence on which to base their inquiry . I listened anxiously . Dinner had been at the usual hour , they were saying ; Nicky , Peter , Alexia , and Maud and of course Conrad had been at dinner . Drue was there , too , said Maud , but the other nurse ( her eager black eyes went to me ) was on duty so a tray was sent tip to her . l ; ut. nothing happened at dinner ; no one talked much : all of them ate the same food . So he could n't have been poisoned then . " Digitalis , " said Nugent , " has a very rapid effect . Almost instantaneous . " And went on . The evening had been passed , again , much as usual . They had played bridge , Conrad , Maud , Alexia and Peter  --  Nicky had read and watched . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current news , the war , affairs at home ; sometime dur-  | ing the game ( no one remembered the time ) Conrad had sent Alexia to get the clipping ; the box of medicine had been in the desk drawer then . All efforts to discover more exactly when it had disappeared were without result . At about eleven they had stopped playing . Conrad had gone for his walk , the others had gone to bed . Dr. Chivery had stopped shortly after eleven ( Maud told this , too ; she was altogether more eagerly informative than anyone else ) ; he had gone to the room she always occupied when she stayed as she so often did at the Brent house , but he had not remained for long . He had walked to the Chivery cottage . " There 's a path , a short-cut , " said Maud , and Nugent nodded . " He said he did n't see Brent ? " said Soper to Nugent who nodded again . So I knew they had already questioned Dr. Chivery . Usually Conrad returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very slowly , so probably he had not taken a really long walk . His coat , stick , and hat were in their usual place in the closet off the hall . His dinnerjacket hung there , too , and he had put on a lounge coat and , apparently , gone directly into the library . " He liked to rest a little before going upstairs , " said Beevens . " He had a nightcap or smoked a cigarette or two as a rule and then went to bed . He never wanted me to wait up for him ; he locked the front door himself . " Nightcap . Brandy ? Well , they had taken away the decanter ; they would know if there was poison in it . Nicky then created a small sensation by saying abruptly that he had seen Conrad return . " I was here in this room , " he said easily . " I saw Conrad come in , lock the door , remove his coat and hat and put on his lounge coat . " " Nicky ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Soper said , " But look here , Mr. Senour , why did n't you tell us ? " " I did n't think it was important , " said Nicky silkily . " That 's all there is to it , you see . He did n't see me . I was sitting over there by the fire , reading . He went into the library and after a while I went upstairs . That 's all . " Drue was looking at him steadily . I do n't know how I knew that she was holding her breath , perhaps because I was . " Are you sure that 's all ? " said Nugent . " Did anyone ? you , for instance , ? go into the library ? " There was a silence . Nicky smiled and examined the fingernails on one slender hand . " That 's all , " he said with a kind of silky stubbornness . Soper said , " Well , well ; let 's get on , " and began to question about motives and about possible enemies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his little eyes suspicious , except when they rested upon Alexia , of whom he obviously approved and who did look , I must say , very lovely and helpless , except when she lifted her shadowy eyelashes and one caught a glimpse of the very cool and self-possessed look in her eyes . Nicky leaned against the back of her chair in an ostentatiously protecting way , still with the shadow of a smile on his lips , and Alexia sat perfectly still for the most part , answering only when she had to and that briefly , one leg crossed over the other and the toe of her pump making impatient little circles . After a while they sent for Peter I1tiher , who came into the room and sat down not far from me . Ile had told Craig , I imagined , as much as could he told . He sighed a little , unconsciously , as he sat down and then lighted a cigarette and listened . As we all listened . Presently they questioned him  --  or rather recapitulated some earlier bout of questioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the library , was that  | right ? Yes , that was right ; he nodded . Why had he come downstairs at all ? " I told you that , " he said . " I 'd dropped off to sleep , reading . I had n't put up the windows or turned off the light and , when I awoke , the room was too warm . I put up the windows and turned off the light and then I opened the door to the hall , thinking I 'd get air into the room more quickly that way . " As he did it he heard a kind of scream from somewhere downstairs . He 'd listened for a moment and as he was closing the door again I had run along the corridor and down the stairs . So he thought something was wrong , went back to get a dressing gown and slippers and had come down after me . " Mr. Huber , " said the District Attorney , " I want you to think back carefully ; this is very important . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either or both of them  --  doing anything for Mr. Brent ? I mean , definitely , did either of them have a hypodermic syringe in her hand ? Think back . . . . My heart came up in my throat . I did n't dare look at Drue . Then Peter said , positively , " No . " " Are you sure ? " " Absolutely . They were just standing there . We looked at him but he was dead . So Miss Keate sent Miss Cable back upstairs to Craig and me to telephone . I did n't succeed in getting the doctor then . I could n't find the number ; I was upset . Anyway , all at once there was this sound of something falling . . . . " " Yes , yes , you told us about that , " said the District Attorney testily . " Something falling and the sound of a window breaking and we ca n't find anything that fell and there is no window broken . " He turned to me . " Miss Keate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night before the death of Mr. Brent that struck you as being  --  well , out of the way ? Unusual . " From the way he said it , I had a quick impression that he had asked everyone that . Maud looked rather scornful , and Alexia all but yawned . It was one of fate 's dangerous little jokes that I would have answered in the negative as I imagine everyone else had done ) had not Delphine at that point slunk across the hall , with a wary green eye toward the trooper in the doorway . The fleeting glimpse I had of him reminded me of a very trivial tiring I had forgotten up to then . " Why , yes , " I said . " As a matter of fact there was something . " Alexia stopped yawning so suddenly her jaws snapped together and Maud 's scorn changed to alert interest . I went on , " There was a kind of bump against the closed door to my patient 's room . " " Bump ! " said the District Attorney . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . " " Something ! What ? " cried the District Attorney . He looked a little astonished at having , so to speak , got a bite . " Well  --  well , go on , " he said impatiently as I hesitated . " What was it ? Did n't you go to the door and open it and look ? " " Yes . Yes , I did open the door and I saw . . . " I stopped again on the verge of saying I had seen Nicky coming from a room down the hall . But that was wrong . I had seen Nicky , but that was before something  --  whatever it was ? had struck against the door , and struck so sharply it roused me and the cat . No ; that was wrong , too ; the cat had already aroused , as if he heard someone in the hall . The bump against the door had come later . And when I had got to the door and opened it no one was in the hall . The District @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Who did you see ? " Nugent was very still and very observant  --  as , I suddenly realized , everyone in the room was watching , too ,  | and listening . There was indeed a strained and queer silence . I said slowly , confused not so much by the silence as by the singularly intent quality in it , " I did n't see anyone . I do n't know who it was . I saw nothing . " " But you . . . " began Soper explosively , and Nugent said , " All right , Miss Keate . We believe you . " His eyes looked very narrow and green . He went on quickly , " You were in the library when you heard the sound of something falling . What did you do ? " " I ran upstairs . " I told him of it again , briefly . And brought forward what seemed to be , up to then , a bit of new evidence , or at least a new fact . That was the matter of Craig 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a bruise on his temple . " He says somebody was in the hall and struck him , " I explained . The District Attorney interrupted . " Who ? " " He said he does n't know . But if someone did that it proves there was an intruder , a  --  a thief . . . " But he said he was in the hall when he was struck , " said Soper , looking a little impressed with his own astuteness , and very pompous . " You say you found him in the linen room . " " I did . Or rather Miss Cable found him there first . " Again glances went to Drue ; again no one questioned her . " Someone must have dragged him into the linen closet and left him there . A man , I mean . " " A woman could have done it , " began Soper , and Nugent cut in rather quickly . " I 'll question Craig Brent later , " he said , his eyes still very green and thoughtful , however . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach and began again briskly . " Now then , about Conrad Brent 's business affairs . . . " That did not take a very long time ; everyone I think was convinced that Conrad 's business affairs were in good order and in any case it would be an easy matter for  | them to find out through his bankers and his lawyer . There seemed to be , however , little question on that point . He had been a rich man , living well within an income which was , certainly , on the more or less lavish side . Only later inquiry could confirm it , but just then there seemed to be no reasonable doubt but that his affairs were perfectly balanced and sound . Nothing however was said of his will  --  which seemed to me another omission . After that they went into the matter of alibis  --  very cautiously , very suavely , so one did n't at first realize the exact trend of all their detailed questions of time . In the end , however , so far as I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nicky , at least , had admitted his presence in the morning room when Conrad returned . Had he seen Drue ? Was he going to tell of her interview with Conrad ? There was no way to know and no way to read Nicky 's enigmatic face . At length the District Attorney observed , rather pettishly , that there was no alibi , really , for murder by poison , looked impatiently at Nugent and fidgeted . Nugent looked back at him and shook his head , only a little , almost imperceptibly , but as if he 'd said , " Wait  --  not yet . " I saw that . And I thought I prepared myself for it . I did n't really ; no one does against . catastrophe . But I knew that it was coming ; they had asked about a hypodermic , so they had seen that tiny red mark on Conrad Brent 's arm . They had searched l ) rue 's room and mine and had taken away the little bag in which she carried instruments and the few drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of digitalis and knew she did n't have a hypodermic  --  as I had and as any nurse normally would have . They had established the fact that Conrad 's medicine was gone , box and all , so he could n't have taken it himself . They would n't have far to look for a motive , or a witness of sorts , either , for Nicky must have seen Drue going to the library even if , for any purpose of his own ,  | Ise did not then admit it . Above all , the look Soper and Nugent exchanged admitted a previously agreed-upon purpose . So they had not yet questioned Drue . My feeling about that was right . Obviously they thought that it would weaken her to have to sit there before them and hear the case built up  --  possibilities eliminated , circumstances set forth so they were indisputable . I felt cold and queerly stiff , as if all my muscles had tightened hard . I felt that I had to look at Drue and I would n't . It came sooner than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought the thing to its ugly climax . She said , suddenly and impatiently , interrupting a question as to any possibility of the medicine box having been empty and thrown away by Conrad himself , previous to his attack , " Nonsense ! " Everyone looked at her . She said again , " That 's utter nonsense ! Conrad never would have done that . He always kept a supply of digitalis on hand . Besides , as Claud has already told you , his prescription had been refilled only three days ago . He had n't had an attack since , so it was a full , new supply . And I do n't see why you do n't get to the point . He was given a hypodermic , you know that ; Claud saw what he felt sure was the mark and told me . Nobody but a nurse would have given him a hypodermic  --  a nurse or a doctor , and Claud was n't here . And you know who had a motive . " I said quickly , " A hypodermic mark ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a light black look at me . Nugent said , " Do you want to say something , Nurse Keate ? " " Yes . I do n't see how anyone , even a doctor , can make a positive statement about the mark made by a hypodermic needle . It is very small ; frequently so small that it  | ca n't be seen at all . The skin is elastic and instantly closes after the needle is withdrawn . " Maud 's eyes snapped . " It frequently shows , too . " I shrugged . " I do n't question Dr. Chivery 's statement to the effect that he found some sort of small mark that might have been made by a hypodermic needle . I do question anyone being able to say with any degree of certainty that a  --  well , a bare pinprick is the mark of a needle . " " Miss Keate , " said Maud . " You are not here to question the veracity of the doctor you are working for ! " " It 's the plain truth , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around toward Nugent . " Dr. Chivery 's word has never been questioned . As I was about to say , it is obvious that only one person in the house had a motive . That was Drue Cable . " " Mrs. Chivery . . . " began Nugent , but she went on so vehemently that her tight little body jerked ; her black eyes plunged in little bursts from one to the other of us . " She must have come down to the library to see him ; to try to persuade him not to make her go . He had told her she must leave today . She threatened him , yesterday afternoon . I heard her and so did you , Nicky . You heard her say , I could kill you for this . ' I know exactly what happened . She came to the library and she accused him of breaking up her marriage . Conrad had an attack and asked her for medicine ; she went to the desk and  --  and took the medicine away , pretended it was gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was a nurse . How could he know what she would do . . . ? " " Stop ! We 'll get a lawyer . You ca n't accuse . . . " I rose and Nugent was at my side , his hand tight on my arm . Drue looked like a ghost , white , rigid , with great dark eyes fastened on Maud . There was a shadow of a smile on Alexia 's lips . Maud swept on vigorously , black eyes snapping . " So she gave him a hypodermic of digitalis  | and she gave him too much . It killed him . As she planned . She thought it would never be traced . That 's how it happened . . . " " That 's enough , Mrs. Chivery , " said Nugent . But Soper 's voice rose over Nugent 's . " She 's perfectly right , " he said loudly . " I 've thought so from the very first . She 's perfectly right , Nugent ; there 's no other real explanation . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiry . But that 's enough . . . " He got up and looked at Drue , his little eyes bright and accusing . " She did it . The girl did it . She intended to kill him with the revolver . Then he had a heart attack and this way was easier for her , a nurse , and she jumped at it . She hid the medicine ; she pretended to him that it was gone ; she told him she 'd save him . And then she killed him . Arrest Drue Cable now , Lieutenant . It 's a clear case ; I 'll take the responsibility for it , and I 'll bring the charge . We 'll get a grand jury indictment at once . It 'll be murder in the first degree . " Nicky looked at his fingernails . " Well , " he said softly into the sudden silence , " I may as well tell you , then . Drue was with Conrad in the library . I saw her . And I heard her say , I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | I0 DRuE rose automatically , as if she did n't know what she was doing , but she did n't speak . I was close beside her and I would have known . Alexia smiled a little and said something low to Nicky . Maud looked openly triumphant ; Peter quickly started for the door as if to tell Craig and then as quickly came back into the room again . Soper said loudly that he was right , he 'd known it from the first , but Nicky ought to have told it earlier . I believe I said loudly , too , a number of times that l ) ruc would n't talk without a lawyer . I could n't think of anything else to say . Then Nugent 's voice cracked like a whip , so viciously that it brought us all up short . " Do you mean she had the revolver with her ? In her hand ? " he asked N icky . " Oh , no , " said Nicky . " I would have seen it . " " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ca n't say about that , " said Nicky airily . " And what did you do then ? " " After I saw her go into the library ? " Nicky 's tone was very nonchalant . " I thought from the sound of Conrad 's voice that she  --  well , might need somebody to back her  | up . But she seemed able to take care of herself , so I went upstairs . I 'd just got to sleep when something fell  --  I do n't know what  --  and they said Conrad was dead . " " What else did you hear ? " demanded Soper quickly . " What did Brent say when she told him she had his revolver ? Did he call for help ? You must have heard what else they said ! " Nicky paused , looked at his fingernails , thought for a moment and said , " N-no . No , I 'm afraid not . " " But if you heard their voices . . . " began Soper , and Nugent said abruptly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And Nicky said he would n't . It was an inexplicable and sudden volte face to which he clung with silky stubbornness . " I ca n't swear to any thing , " he said . " I wo n't . I 've only said that Drue came downstairs while Conrad was in the library . " Soper was furious . " You said they had a row . You said you saw her in the library with him just before he died . You said she threatened him with his own revolver ! " " I wo n't swear to anything , " said Nicky , ignoring Alexia 's frown and Maud 's angry eyes and clutching little hand upon his arm . " You do n't have to , " shouted Soper angrily . " Every word you 've said has been taken down in shorthand . Perfectly openly ; you were all aware of it . " One of the troopers in the corner , scribbled that too , rapidly , in his shorthand tablet . But Nicky shook his head . " You 'll never get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind on the witness stand . I wo n't be the one to bring evidence like that against anybody  --  in court . " Alexia was biting her full underlip with sharp white teeth , her eyes ominously fixed on Nicky . Maud made an angry little exclamation and must have vanished about then , silently , for when next I looked for her she was gone . Soper said angrily that Nicky would be a witness ;  | he could n't help himself ; he , Soper , would see to that . Nugent said suddenly , " We 'll question Miss Cable alone . Right , Soper ? " " But . . . " said Alexia , and Nugent said again , " Alone . If you please . . . So the others  --  Alexia , Nicky , Peter and Beevens  --  were obliged to leave , and did so rather reluctantly , I thought , as if they wanted to stay . But Nugent closed the door after them briskly , and Soper looked at me . " Well ? " he said sharply , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said simply but firmly . " You 're not ! You heard what . . . " " Oh , let her stay , " said Nugent . Soper shrugged and Drue , standing very slim and erect beside the tall armchair , her gray eyes level and clear , said , " I did n't murder him . " Said it like a simple statement , clearly and distinctly , like a child reciting a lesson . I suppose it seemed unreal to her . Yet it was real enough , too . " You were with him , " said Soper . " You had a motive .... " He began his attack with bluster , but Nugent 's voice cut sharply into the bluster , " Miss Cable , " he said , " will you make a statement of exactly what you did do ? Just tell it to us in your own words . " " I think she ought to have a lawyer , " I said again . " You can refuse to talk , I ) rue . " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in any case she lifted her firm little chin and looked at Nugent . " I 'll tell you , " she said . " I 'll tell you as much as I can . " I held my breath again and tried to think of ways to stop her if she said too much . " I was in the library as Nicky says , " she began . " All right , Miss Cable , go on . " " I did want to talk to Mr. Brent . So I waited until he returned from his walk , then I came to the library . We talked for some time . He had a heart attack then and . . . " She faltered , and I was sure she was going to tell about  | the hypodermic . I rustled warningly . A faint flush came into her face and her hand went up to her throat , almost as if to stop the words on her lips . " And  --  he died , " she said . " If such a large amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got it . " Well , that was true enough and so far safe . But I wished I could be sure that she saw , as I saw , that the one thing they were after was an admission that she had given Conrad digitalis . It was the important material evidence ; it was the clinching fact , it was the missing link in the chain they had forged . There was no possible way for her to prove , ever ( to them , or to a jury ) , how much she had given him , and that it was not a lethal amount . Her instinct was for telling them the truth , I knew that ; and the truth would have been , literally , the most horrible and fatal trap , as things stood then . Soper burst into question again . " But this revolver , Miss Cable . You had a revolver . Why ? " She turned to face him . " I found that revolver in the garden , " she said steadily , " yesterday afternoon . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Where my  --  that is , where Craig was shot that night . It was hidden and I found it . In the burlap wrapping around one of the rose shrubs . " Nugent 's eyes had an odd expression . " Why did you look for it , Miss Cable ? " he said . " Why did you bring it to your room ? " She turned back to him ; there was less defiance in her manner when she spoke to Nugent , more confidence ? which might be her undoing . She seemed to trust him and to want to tell him the whole story and Soper was ready and eager to pounce upon any unguarded admission . She said , " Because I did n't believe the story of an accident . I went to the garden just to have a look at the place where my " ? again she corrected herself quickly-  | " where Craig had been hurt . I searched it and I found the gun . That 's all . I brought it to my room because I intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Why ? " said Nugent rather softly . " Because it proved someone shot at him , " she said . " He says it was accident , " said Nugent , watching her closely . " He ought to know . " " I wanted him to have that revolver , " she said with a kind of obliquity . " You 're saying that his accident was actually an attempted murder ? " cried Soper . Again she whirled around to face him , her chin high , her voice steady . " He would n't have shot himself like that ! He would n't have been cleaning a gun in the garden at eleven o'clock at night ! " " Did you know that the revolver belonged to Conrad Brent ? " " I was n't sure . I knew that he 'd had a revolver . " " Did he admit it belonged to him ? When you took it to the library , I mean ? " " Yes . That is , by implication . He recognized it and asked where I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Soper with a crafty look , " did you accuse him of trying to kill his son ? " " No . Certainly not . " " Why did you give him the revolver ? " " Because I wanted him to know of it , of course . I wanted him to know that I had found it in the garden , hidden . I wanted him to know . " " Why ? " said Soper again . " Naturally because something ought to be done about it . It proved that Craig did n't shoot himself . He would n't have hidden it . " " Exactly what did he say ? " Drue flushed . " He said I could n't have found the re  | volver just there . He said I was  --  was trying to make trouble . " " And you . . . " " I saw then that he was ill . I told him he 'd better lie down . I started to leave but he  --  he asked me to stay with him . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and died . " After a moment Nugent said , " Who do you think shot Craig ? " Again the defiance went out of her . She shook her head . " I do n't know . I do n't know . . . " " Do n't know ! Of course , you do n't know ! It 's an obvious attempt to divert your inquiry , Lieutenant . I 'm surprised that you ca n't see through this girl 's story . " Soper came close to Drue , his face red and threatening , shaking a pudgy but forceful forefinger under her nose . " Now , you see here , Miss . We want the truth . You did quarrel with Conrad Brent , did n't you ? " " I did n't quarrel with him . I asked him to permit me to stay and take care of Craig . " " You quarreled with him ! You were heard yesterday afternoon when he tried to send you away . You blamed him for breaking up your marriage . You came here in the hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't let you , so you killed him . " Drue 's face was n't white any more ; two scarlet flames were in her cheeks , her eyes flashed . " I came here to nurse Craig , " she said . " And he was my husband until his father . . . " " Drue , Drue ! " I cried , my hand on her arm . And Soper said , " Arrest her , Nugent . I insist upon it . I 'll make you responsible if she gets away . It 's a murder charge , there 's no use in prolonging this thing . Take her away . . . . " " I do n't think there 's enough evidence  --  material evidence  --  to convict , " said Nugent softly but very coolly .  | " Enough evidence ! " snorted the District Attorney . " What more do you want ? There 's the hypodermic . . . . " " We have n't made sure that she had one . " " You will , you will ! No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you " ? he pounced on me , his eyes angry , bright slits in his red face ? " you are putting her up to it . Well , we 'll take care of you , too . Besides , there 's the witness . . . . " Nicky Senour , " said Nugent again softly . " And he says he wo n't swear to it . Besides , he did n't see her kill him . He said only that she was in the library with Brent . . . . " " He said . they were having a row . That kind of thing goes a long way with a jury . Do n't be a fool , Nugent . You 'll get the evidence . But put the girl under arrest ; make sure you 've got her . All the evidence in the world wo n't do you any good later if you 've let the girl who did it get away . Arrest her . . . . " I 'll take her into custody , " said the Lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? " " I 'll keep her here , in her room . Under guard , " said Nugent . And in the end , incredibly , that was exactly what he did . But first they questioned her again , and made me leave before they began . I would have stayed ; but when a District Attorney , a Police Lieutenant and two remarkably stalwart and able-bodied troopers are lined up against one , there 's nothing much to do . I retired as ungracefully as it lay in my power to do and sat on the bench in the hall watching the door . Never before in my whole nursing experience have I let anything come between me and my patient but frankly , while I sat there , eyes glued to the doorof that room , trying and failing to hear anything but a rapid murmur of voices , I did n't care whether Craig Brent lived or died , except I hated him so , just then , for being the cause of Drue 's presence in that ill-  | ornened house that I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boiling oil . If I could have made him come alive again . My own impulses to murder , while vehement in their way , are not very lasting . Once I did go upstairs . The door to Craig 's room was open and I peeked in cautiously . Peter Huber was sitting in a chair beside him , smoking . Anna was standing at the window , her back toward the room and her head bent with a handkerchief to her eyes , and Craig and Peter were talking in low voices . Craig looked all right , certainly the police were not hounding him from trap to trap , from admission to admission , from refuge to refuge . I went quickly back to the bench downstairs and they were still in the little morning room . I was there when they emerged . Drue was white and drawn-looking ; even her lips were chalky . She looked at me with great , haunted , dark eyes and I could read nothing in them , although I thought she was thankful I was there , waiting for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in her room , under guard ! I followed . Soper , giving me a suspicious look , had turned into the library . Well . Nugent , if he had eyes in his head as he certainly did , could n't have failed to see that my room connected with Drue 's . But the trooper already on guard did n't stop me when I entered my own room . And of course I went straight through the bathroom to Drue . She was standing in the middle of the room , facing the door , head up , hands clenched at her sides as if at bay . When she heard me she whirled and suddenly crumpled down on the bed . " Oh , Sarah , Sarah , what shall I do ? " I sat down on the bed beside her and took her hands . " What have you told them ? What did they make you say ? Quick , Drue . Tell me . " In the end it was n't too bad ; which is to say it could have been worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her at length about her interview with Conrad , about her reasons for coming to Balifold , about the hypodermic syringe they had not found among her other nursing tools , about the supply of digitalis they had found . Somehow ( as if she saw now , clearly , her own danger ) she had evaded them ; she had not admitted that she had given Conrad a hypodermic , she had not admitted that he asked her for the medicine and that , when she went to look for it , it was not in the drawer . She had indeed fought and evaded  --  especially about the box of medicine  --  in a way that was not like Drue ; she was , as most of us are , naturally and innately truthful . If she had been fighting thus to protect somebody else ( somebody she loved ) it would have seemed to me more comprehensible and more like Drue . She had that kind of courage ; I 've seen her fight to save a patient with the courage and fury of a tigress . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was only thankful that she had kept them from grinding any really convicting admission out of her . " I kept saying I did n't know , I did n't know . I remembered what you said , and told them I wanted a lawyer . Sarah , when they asked me a direct question : did I give him a hypodermic of digitalis ? Did he ask me for his medicine ? ? I  --  I squirmed and evaded and wriggled out of it . " She pressed her hands over her face . " Funny , " she said unevenly , " how hard it is to tell an outright lie , even when you 've made up your mind to do it . Instead of lying , you  --  you evade , you weasel out of making a direct statement , you  --  oh , it 's fantastic , really . You employ all the spirit of lying and yet you ca n't make yourself conquer the fact . Well , " she took her hands from her face and stared at the rug , " they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly . But  --  oh , Sarah , what can I do ! " Well , I said what I could , which was little enough . I  | told her we 'd get a lawyer . I told her they had nothing but circumstantial evidence . " But they convict people on circumstantial evidence . Do n't they , Sarah ? " " Never , " I told her stoutly and falsely . " It is n't legal . " And made her lie down flat on the bed and fixed her some aromatic spirits of ammonia which she did n't drink . But before we could really talk or outline any kind of sensible course of action there was a knock on the door , and it was the trooper Wilkins , the man on guard . And they wanted us to come to Craig 's room . " Right away , please , " said the trooper . Drue went to the mirror before we went , however . It gave me a kind of lift to see her put cold water on her eyes and powder her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a little , unconscious declaration of war . But if Craig saw it , or was aware of anything but the bare fact of Drue 's presence , there was no hint of it in his attitude when we entered his room . He gave us both a remote and impersonal look ; Drue might have been the barest acquaintance , certainly anything but a woman who was once his wife . Soper was there , suspicious the instant his eyes fell upon Drue again . Nugent was there and the ubiquitous trooper with the shorthand tablet . Anna was hovering in a corner but Peter had gone . After a closer glance at Craig I sent Anna away and took up my post at his side with my fingers on his pulse . I did feel a wave of compunction . There was a flare of color in his cheeks and his eyes were too bright . " I sent for you , Miss Keate , " he said to me , " and for Drue . I thought this concerned both of you . " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to Nugent . " Ten minutes . . . The District Attorney swelled up as if about to protest and at a look from Nugent went down again . Drue went  | quietly over to stand in the shadow of the window curtains ; the light fell upon her white skirt and her face was in the shadow . But I think all of us , all the time , were poignantly aware of that slender , listening figure . " We were n't going to question you , Brent , if we could help it , until you were better , " said Nugent . " However , we both wanted very much to see you . . . . " " All right , " said Craig . " But first , exactly what is your case against Miss Cable ? Facts , I mean . That you can substantiate . " " I 'll tell you , " said Lieutenant Nugent , and did , wasting no words and outlining their case against Drue in black and white . She had quarreled with Conrad Brent ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; ( " that is , " said Nugent looking carefully past Drue 's white figure and out the window , " from you , Mr. Brent . . . " ) she had had digitalis ; the medicine was missing from its customary place and there was the mark which might be that of a hypodermic needle on the body of Conrad Brent . He explained , still briefly but pungently , that since no one else knew anything of the missing box of pills there was only one construction that could be placed upon their absence , plus the hypodermic and the fatal amount of digitalis found in Conrad Brent 's body . And that was that Drue had removed the medicine as a pretext to administer a fatal dose of digitalis . " Am I to understand then that your whole theory is based upon a presumption that Miss Cable came here with the purpose of effecting a reconciliation with  --  with me , and that her purpose was so overwhelmingly strong that she murdered my father because he opposed her ? " There was an edge in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's out of the question . As a motive that is preposterous . Neither Miss Cable nor I have any desire to remarry . Miss Cable did not come here with any such purpose . "  | " Why did she come here ? " said Soper . A flicker of a smile came into Craig 's eyes and vanished . " She is a nurse . It was sheer coincidence that she was called when I was injured . She needed the money and , as our divorce was entirely amicable , there was no earthly reason why she should n't come . " " Then why , " said Soper acutely , " did she quarrel with your father ? " Craig lifted his eyebrows . " I 'm not sure she did quarrel with my father  --  but if so I suggest that that was no diffirult achievement . " " Really , Mr. Brent , " said Soper looking shocked . " Your father . . . " " I know , I know , " said Craig . " But you are making this an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living , too . However , it is likely that my father asked her to leave and she , professionally , resented being kicked out of the house . In any case , that is neither here nor there . For in the first place , your evidence against her is altogether circumstantial . You ca n't prove any of it .... " " There I beg to differ with you , " interrupted Soper . " If we find her hypodermic outfit and it has contained digitalis . . . " Nugent was looking very glum . Craig said quickly , " But you have n't . So you have no proof whatever . And even so , you see , she was n't here the night an attempt was made to murder me . And it is n't likely that there are two murderers floating around in  --  in this house . " He said it rather lightly and looked gray and terribly grim around the mouth . " Two  --  but you told everybody it was accident . . . " began Soper explosively and Nugent broke in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who shot you ? " Craig closed his eyes wearily . " I could have told you all I knew of it yesterday if Chivery had n't doped me so thoroughly . I understand you were here making an inquiry . "  | " The girl had the revolver , too ! " cried Soper . " You did n't say anything about that , Nugent . " " Mr. Brent was n't shot , " said Nugent . " You mean Conrad . Craig here was shot and .. . " Miss Cable was not here when I was shot , " said Craig . Soper paid no attention to that . He said , " How do we know she 's telling the truth about the revolver ? Sounds much more likely to me that she took Conrad 's revolver and threatened him with it . And then changed her mind as she thought of an easier way to get rid of him . Then she thought up this story of finding the revolver in the garden in order to explain why she had it . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " said Craig . " Why , to  --  to clean off her fingerprints ! Or perhaps she was excited and forgot the revolver . Left it in her room when she went to get the digitalis and forgot it . We found it ; she had to explain it . And also she saw a chance to throw dust in our eyes ; to suggest that Craig 's accident was attempted murder and thus , that the person who shot Craig and the person who killed Conrad were the same , which would let her out inasmuch as she was not here that night . " " No , no , " cried Drue from the window . " I did n't . I ... " " I can corroborate Miss Cable 's story of the revolver , " I broke in hastily . " Or at least part of it . " But when I had told them as convincingly as I could of seeing her return to the house from the direction of the garden they were not very much impressed . " Could you see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was wearing her cape . " " So you did n't see that it was a revolver ? " " Not exactly . It had to be something small . " " But in fact you are not sure she carried anything . " " It was my impression . . " Impressions ! " snorted Soper .  | Nugent shook his head . Drue turned suddenly back toward the window ; suddenly , I thought , to conceal tears . " Let 's get back to your accident , " said Nugent abruptly , addressing Craig . " Did somebody shoot you ? If so , who ? " " All right , " said Craig . " This is what happened . I was walking in the garden ; no reason for it  --  just walking . It was dark ; there 's no moon . There was a rustle in some shrubs . I turned around , thinking it was the dog . I stepped a little nearer the shrubs ; anyway , I could see a hand . Barely see it , the rest was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a figure . And then something hit my shoulder , as if somebody had given me a kind of hard slap . Then I realized I 'd been shot . I think I started for the shrub ; I must have called for help . I remember stumbling and then that was all until they were carrying me upstairs . Beevens and Pete . Then Chivery came . But I did n't see anybody clearly in the shrub ; I just knew somebody was there . I did n't even really see the revolver , " he said . " But I imagine that Miss Cable found it and that that is the revolver she had in her room . I asked her to try to find it ; I had a kind of lucid moment , the way you do when you 're drugged . She was here and I asked her to look for it . Naturally I wanted to know who shot me ; I wanted the evidence . " Soper 's cold little eyes practically lost themselves in suspicious wrinkles . " That 's not Miss Cable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look for the revolver . " Craig shot a glance at Drue . " Did n't she ? " he said imperturbably . " Well , that 's the way it was . " Nugent said , " The revolver belonged to your father . Mrs. Brent and Mr. Senour have identified it . " " He kept it , " said Craig , accepting the fact of the revolver 's ownership without question , " in the desk in the library . He never locked the desk ; anything valuable he  | put in the safe . The safe is behind one of those panels in the library . " " You mean anybody might have taken the revolver , " said Soper . " Obviously . " Nugent was looking thoughtful . He said , " Was the hand you saw wearing a glove ? " Craig 's pulse gave a leap and began to race like an accelerated motor . But he said coolly enough , looking straight at Nugent , " I have n't the faintest idea . It was dark . There was only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a hand ? " " Why  --  yes . " There was a little silence and I looked at my watch in a marked manner . Soper said , " So you think the same person that killed your father tried first to kill you ? " " I do n't know , " said Craig . " But I do know Miss Cable was in New York when I was shot . " " How do you know that ? " interposed Soper . Craig lifted his eyebrows . " Obviously she was n't here . " Nugent said abruptly , " It 's all right , Mr. Soper . She was in New York ; I checked that and the telephone call to the Nurses ' Registry office . " Soper looked annoyed . Craig went on quickly , " In any case , it is n't likely that she would take a pot shot at me one night and the next night poison my father because she wanted to see me and he opposed it . The motives seem a little mixed . " Soper said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only trying to get at the truth . You need n't take that tone . " " I know , " said Craig soberly and with the edge gone from his voice , so it was only weary and honest . " I understand your position and I appreciate what you are trying to do . I 'll do everything I can to help you . But I really do think you are wasting time making out a case against Miss Cable ; she was not anywhere near , the night I was  | shot . And she had no motive to kill my father . She does n't want to marry me any more than I want to marry her . Our marriage is absolutely finished and neither of us regrets it . " Do you mean to say , " said Soper , glancing covertly in Drue 's direction , " do you mean to say that if Drue Cable ? your former wife , came to you and suggested that you remarry , you would refuse her ? " I did n't look at Drue ; no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a clock . " At the risk of sounding unchivalrous , " he said coolly and distinctly , " yes . "  | 11 I SAID , " Time is up . I 'll have to ask you to go . " I must have sounded a little vigorous about it , for instantly Nugent turned around and stalked toward the door . But Soper said , " Your father was a rich man , Brent . Who benefits by his death ? I mean to say , what are the main provisions of his will ? " " You 'll have to ask his lawyer . John Wells . In Balifold . Are you going to release Miss Cable ? " Nugent jerked around to look at Soper ; Soper turned a fine magenta . " Release her ! By God , no ! She stays here under guard or in jail . " " But I need her , " I said quickly , essaying a rally . " I need her to help me nurse Mrs. Brent . " " You can get another nurse out from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under guard or in jail . " Well , I did n't want another nurse bothering around . Anna could give me any It el p I needed . Soper waddled out of the room like an enraged and vicious duck . Nugent , however , drew me into the hall . " Miss Keate , " he said in a low voice , " Who was here in the hall last night ? When something bumped against the door and you went to look ? "  | " Why  --  why , no one ! That is , oh , some time ( perhaps half an hour before ) I saw Nicky in the hall . But not after the bump on the door . There 's a dent  --  here , " I put my finger on it and he looked at it , his face as inexpressive as a Red Indian 's . " But it 's as I told you , " I added . " After the bump against the door I did n't see anybody in the hall . " Something very queer in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I advise you to tell me . Think it over , " and went away . Leaving me a little perplexed , for if I had seen anyone or anything I should have been only too glad to tell him and shift the burden of suspicion from Drue . When I entered his room again , Craig was lying with his eyes closed . Wilkins advanced a little , tentatively , toward Drue , who was still at the window . " Wait outside , " I told him , and with an uncertain look at me he did so and I closed the door after him . But if I had had , as I do n't think I had really , any vague notion of a word of understanding between Craig and Drue I was disappointed . Drue had turned so I could see only her back , slim and erect , and her lifted , white-capped head . " Are they gone ? " Craig said to me . " Yes , " I said . And then because I had to , I said slowly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ? You could n't have seen the color in the dark . Why did you think it was yellow ? " His eyes flared open . He looked very straight at me for a long moment . Then he said definitely , " I do n't know what you 're talking about . " Which was about what I might have expected . " All right . I ca n't make you tell me . But there 's one thing you 'll have to explain , if not to me , then to the police . You said  --  half asleep yesterday ? ' there 'll be murder done . Tell Claud . ' What did you mean ? "  | He just lay and looked at me through half-shut eyes whose expression I could n't read . And he denied it flatly . " I do n't remember it . I could have meant anything . Unless I was referring to the attack upon me . Go ahead and tell the police . " " I will , " I said . And Drue whirled around then . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Craig , you need n't have lied for me ! " she cried . " I did n't , " he said briefly . " You did n't send me for the revolver . . . " " Oh , " said Craig , " that . But the rest of it was the truth , was n't it ? I mean , you did n't come here with the intention of  --  of " ? he smiled a little , though his eyes were very intent ? " of a reconciliation ? I 'm sure you did n't . " The smile left his lips , but his eyes were still very intent , watching Drue . " It 's something neither of us wants . That 's why I told them . . . " And at that instant the trooper , Wilkins , knocked on the door . I le looked apologetic when I opened it . But Drue had to go with him all the same . When the door closed behind her , Craig closed his eyes and lay there , very quiet , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , after that the day settled into a smoldering kind of quiet . Event t tally 1 bestirred myself to my duties . Craig was really on the mend , in spite of occurrences which , certainly , were not exactly conducive to convalescence . He must have been thinking hard , for he was unexpectedly docile , while I gave him a quick sponge bath and an alcohol rub , got him into fresh pajamas and took a look at the dressing on his wound . " Such a fuss about nothing , " he said , but winced nevertheless as I worked . " If it had been a Jap bullet I 'd feel as if I deserved some of this fuss . " " You 'll be dodging Jap bullets soon enough , " I said tartly . " Hold still . "  | " So long as I dodge them , " he said , and grinned . While I thought of youth and war and the hideous waste of it . I said , " When do you go ? " " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " With this ? Nonsense ! " " I feel fine . I 'd get up now if you 'd let me . " " Certainly . Just try it . And start your wound bleeding . " " Would it ? " " Listen , young man , you just escaped with your life . Do you want to get well enough to leave or do you want to be an invalid for several weeks ? " " Okay , okay , " he said but looked rebellious , so I realized I 'd have to watch him . I said , " If you want to spend the spring at home or in a hospital , all right , get up . If you want to fight , do as I tell you . Stay in bed . I 'll get you well . " For the first time he looked rather approving and pleased . " In time to leave when the orders come through ? " " It depends . I 'll try . Do you know where you will be sent ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the inquest over satisfactorily and everything settled before I go . " " Yes , naturally . Does Drue know you are leaving so soon ? " " No , " he said , and eyed me with sudden sharpness . " And you are not to tell her , either . " " But . . . " I mean that . Understand ? " " All right . If you do n't want her to know , but I think . . . " " I 'm doing the thinking about this , " he said , and then added with a touch of apology , " I 'm sorry . " I eased him back onto the pillow . The wound was doing all right ; but the pain of even the slight motion  | brought moisture to his forehead and around his mouth . Well , it was just luck that the bullet had missed his heart . I said , " Have you been at home long ? " " Only a few days . There , that 's better . " He relaxed against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The brave soldier ! " he said , deriding his weakness . " You 're lucky to be alive , " I said . And , as the shadow of perplexity and horror and sorrow came over his young face again , I said impulsively , " Mr. Brent , what do you think happened last night ? This is your home . You know these people . What 's your theory ? " He closed his eyes . Weakly ? Or was it , I thought suddenly , to shut me out , so I would read no expression in his eyes that might reveal his thoughts . He said , " Theory ? I have n't any . I do n't know what to think . " " Do you think it was accident ? " I persisted . " Or do you think the police are right ? " " Murder , " he said thoughtfully after a moment . " No , I do n't think it was murder . My father had no . . . " He had been about to say , I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and changed it . " No one would murder my lather . " He paused again for a moment and then went on , his eyes still closed , " My father and I had our differences . Yet we loved each other . The differences we had did n't separate us in that way . I 'm sure that he felt that . I 'm sure he did . " " One knows things like that without words , " I said . " I 'm sure he felt as you do . I 'm sure he was proud of you , too . And that he . . . " " No , " said Craig rather quickly . " No , he was n't proud of me . Not that I 've ever done anything to make anybody proud of me , or anything to be exactly ashamed of either ? that is , I 'm an ordinary fellow . But he was n't proud ... " " I meant , about your getting into the air force . Having a son going to fight for his country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes sound trite . But Craig  | laughed a little , on an unsteady note , so he caught himself up quickly . He said , " You do n't understand . That was one of our differences . He was n't afraid ; it is n't that . He just did n't want me to go to war . " " Why not ? " " Because he  --  because . . . " He moved a little again . " Oh , it 's nothing , Miss Keate . " He said it easily enough ; yet something in his tone caught my ear and my interest . I waited , thinking of it and of what he had said  --  or rather had failed to say . And he added all at once , " It was nothing my father could help . He 'd felt that way for years . And , anyway , he changed lately . I know that he changed . Since December seventh , I mean . Since we entered the war . Yes , he 'd changed , I 'm sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanting to get whatever it was he was trying to say clear in my mind . He did n't want it clear for me , however ; he said rather brusquely , pushing the subject away , " Pete will be going too , you know . Soon . He thinks in another few weeks . " " Pete ? Oh , Peter Huber . What 's he doing here , by the way ? Did he come to see you ? " Naturally , it was n't my business to know ; still , I have seldom if ever scrupled to ask questions , particularly when I wanted to know . As in this case . Craig said , moving his shoulder a little and wincing again , " No , he 's been here several weeks . Came on from the coast to try to get into some branch of the service . He 's waiting now to hear ; remembered we lived here and came up to Balifold and was staying at the inn when my father discovered him and made him come here . Ouch . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What makes it hurt like that ? " " It 's doing all right . No infection . Did Mrs. Brent know Pete in school , too ? "  | " Mrs. Brent ? No . " The corner of his mouth twitched . " Pete 's more or less susceptible . " " Susceptible ! Oh , you mean . . . " There was n't anybody to mean except Alexia . Craig said quickly , " Oh , it 's only Pete . Alexia 's so  --  beautiful , " he finished rather dryly . " But then . . . " I was struck by a sudden and rather far-fetched speculation . If Peter Huber had fallen madly in love with Alexia , there existed a motive for Conrad 's murder . Not however a very sound motive ; certainly not a very pleasant one  --  but then a motive for murder is not likely to be pleasant . Mainly , though , there was little if any evidence to back it up . So I caught back my own words . But Craig guessed my unuttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get Alexia ! Peter 's a good egg . Besides , Alexia does n't go for him . " Which was true enough . Alexia had certainly wasted no time in making her intentions clear and they obviously had nothing to do with Peter Huber . The trouble was however that Conrad Brent had been murdered ; the police do n't make mistakes about things like that . It 's very difficult , and I discovered it then , really to face and accept the fact of murder ; yet it 's inescapable too  --  like an ugly , invisible presence . Murder in that house . Murder in the night just past . I put away my instrument case in silence . After I had made Craig comfortable and was sure he was warm , I pushed aside the heavy curtains and opened the windows and aired the room . It was cold , much colder than it had been the day before , with the lowering kind of still gray sky that threatens snow . I could see then , as I could n't the day before , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooded , rose gently up to the gray sky . Roads  | twisted here and there over and among the hills ; and stone walls traced old boundaries . Near at hand , running along just outside the wall and appearing to pass the garden , a path wound downward and out of sight . It led , as a matter of fact , from the Brent house directly to the Chivery cottage about a mile away and was a short cut . The hills and the trees gave an effect of isolation . As I looked , a snowflake , very white against the gray sky , fluttered past my eyes and then another . Shivering a little , I closed the windows . The day went on quietly . Soper , I think , went away shortly after the talk with Craig . Nugent vanished , too , but I believe busied himself for some time , quietly , about the house . Once a policeman came to the door with an ink pad and slide and took my fingerprints ; I must say I did n't relish the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seemed to think . The glass slipped . He would have taken Craig 's fingerprints , too , but Craig looked convincingly asleep , and I would n't permit rousing him . The policeman went away , and I caught a glimpse of Lieutenant Nugent down by the stairs , listening but not talking to Beevens . We were to become well accustomed to Lieutenant Nugent 's spare , silent figure , unobtrusive , yet ubiquitous . He did , indeed , a very good job of lurking . There were , of course , things I wanted to do and just then could n't . The thing that worried me more than anything else was the hypodermic or rather its whereabouts . Who had it and why  --  and above all else what did he intend to do with it ? I use " he " in a general sense ; it seemed to me most likely that Maud 's bright little eyes had ferreted it out . And I could do nothing ; to search the place for so small an object would be at best difficult . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if found , it would be the District Attorney 's triumph and vindication . I had begun to wonder if Chivery had forgotten that he still had a patient in the Brent house when he did finally arrive , late in the afternoon , looking very gray and drawn , and at least ten years older . After I had watched him examine Craig 's wound and taken a few orders he told me to go . " Get some fresh air , " he said , with a kind of glassy heartiness , looking at the corner of my cap . " You need n't come back for at least an hour . I 'll stay with Craig . " As I hesitated , he added , " I want to talk to him . " So I had to leave . My room was orderly and quiet . I went through the bathroom between our rooms and knocked softly on Drue 's door and , as she did n't answer , I opened it cautiously . She was sleeping ; she looked very young and childish lying there with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyelashes dark along her soft cheek . The little dog , Sir Francis , lying on the foot of the bed , watched me intently and growled in a kind of formal way . It was a tiny growl , of course , yet as full of intention and sincerity as a police dog 's growl . It did n't wake Drue and I retired quietly . It suddenly occurred to me that if I 'd married and if I 'd had a daughter she might have been something like Drue . But while I 'm an old maid and make no bones of it I 'm not a sentimental , dithering idiot ; so I thought no more of that , changed to a fresh uniform , took my cape , passed Wilkins in the hall again and went for a walk . No one was in the hall below , so we were n't then , all of us , under close guard . The front door closed heavily behind me and I walked along the driveway toward the public road . It was still gray and cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snowing . Dusk was coming on and it was very quiet . Twenty-four hours ago I had had my  | first indication of smoldering tragedy and terror in that house that lay behind me . The drive went down a long curve among clumps of evergreens . When I reached the huge stone gate-posts I stepped out briskly along the public road which wound north and west with many curves and a little bridge or two . Somewhere along the way Delphine , the cat , picked me up and I looked down at his battle-scarred ears and wondered what had roused him so suddenly in the night . A footstep ? Clothing brushing against the door ? Or had it been something more tenuous even than that ; an awareness of movement outside that door that was denied to my own , merely human , ears ? And I wondered , too , what had struck the door so sharply and so hard . Like a hammer . Gradually , as I walked along , the Brent wall gave way to a low field rock wall beyond which an irregular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And presently , having skirted two sides of the meadow and reached a little ridge , I could see the village of Balifold about a mile or two away . It was a cluster of white houses , narrow and irregular but pleasant streets , and a church or two , for I could see the white steeples rising among bare trees and against the dull gray sky . There were many trees , beautiful , strongly symmetrical maples and oaks , and again evergreens . From there too , spreading casually away from the town , I could see here and there what appeared to be large country estates hiding behind trees and in valleys , like the Brent place . There was about all of it  --  village and wooded hills and the soft dusk  --  a stillness and repose that would have been pleasant , except that there was a definite chill and loneliness in the air . Delphine decided to leave and did so , on secret feline business into the meadow ,  | where his gray body slid into the shadowy growth near at hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Standing on that hill , leaning against the low stone wall , looking down at the village and across those silent hills and valleys , I began to think again of the means of Conrad Brent 's death . The use of poison presupposed a murderer with some knowledge of drugs , accessibility to digitalis , and a certain amount of ingenuity in inducing Conrad Brent to take it . And to take it before Drue had returned with her unlucky hypodermic dose . And that , of course , led me back again , irresistibly , to the circles my thoughts had traveled so many times during the day . Who had murdered Conrad ? Craig Brent had by no means told all he knew ; there was that business of the yellow gloves ; and he had merely , unconvincingly , denied words that were suspiciously prophetic . Against this he had told a story to account for the bruise on his temple which not only sounded true but indicated , in my opinion , a line of inquiry the police would do well to follow . And while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still he had been under my observation at the time Conrad was induced to take poison . I le was also in a drugged state , which would have prohibited clear thinking or quick action . And he had been shot , himself , the previous night . It was not likely , as he had said , that two potential murderers existed in their immediate circle  --  both with the evident intention of cutting off the Brents , root and branch , so to speak . Furthermore , he had so narrowly escaped with his life the night before that there was no doubt at all but that the shooting had been a real attempt at murder . Therefore , someone else had shot him ; he had certainly not shot himself in any fantastic effort to induce just such a theory on the part of the police , and thus clear himself beforehand , so to speak , of his father 's murder .  | No , I did n't think that Craig had murdered Conrad Brent . And it was true that he had done his best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him credit for that . Nicky practically invited suspicion , but I had no evidence to back up any suspicions in that direction . Alexia was , of course , an obvious suspect ; she was young , she was beautiful , she was married to a man she flatly declared she had never loved and that man was the father of a man to whom she had been all but engaged and for whom , apparently , she still cherished what appeared to be far from a purely stepmotherly regard . I thought of her kneeling beside Craig , and the things she had said . " You knew ? you always knew I never loved Conrad . " And then , . . all that is ended now for us both , my darling . " Craig had n't exactly said , " Oh , is n't that fine , hurrah , my father 's dead and you are free ! " Still , he had n't said , " Do n't be a fool , Alexia , " or even looked it . Yet there was no real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Peter Huber or Maud Chivery . Maud had all but run the household during the long years of Conrad 's widowerhood ; it would not have been unnatural for her to feel a kind of jealousy for her young supplanter , Alexia . But that did n't mean that she had murdered Conrad ! And certainly Maud fairly exuded an almost belligerent , tight-lipped respectability which did not go with whatever secret , horribly urgent emotion which , at last unbridled , finds its only relief in murder . I stopped to think of that and then tried not to . It 's a curious thing about murder , and I learned it during those days in the Brent house and among the low-lying Berkshire hills . Murder as a fact has a strangely insistent , wholly appalling quality ; it is almost like a secret and terrible personality . At one instant you may be surrounding yourself with the commonplace , with reality , with everyday things  --  letting yourself think of the weather or what you had for lunch . And then all at once , the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if that grim presence stood invisibly at your elbow and said , mutely , " You may try to evade me , you may try to pretend I have gone , but I 'm still here . You ca n't see me , you do n't know really where I am , but nevertheless I am here . I have struck and I may strike again . How do you know I wo n't ? And how do you know whose body is possessed of me and whose arm will do my will ? " It brings your heart to your throat and your breath stinging in your lungs . That 's queer , too , and primitive , I suppose . As is the way your neck muscles , of their own accord , keep wanting to pull your head around so as to look behind you . Well , that 's the way it is . I felt it then and looked behind me , but there was nothing but hills and gathering dusk and silence . So I went on in my little list to Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared on the scene almost as soon as I had , with a story to explain it which might or might not be true . He had fumbled around about the telephone call to the doctor ; he had run straight upstairs at the sound of something falling and had disappeared . And while he was no relation and so could n't profit directly by Conrad Brent 's death , as all of the others might conceivably do , even the Chiverys , he might have a motive , that is , if he were in love with Alexia . Yet certainly no man is going to murder a woman 's husband without making sure that he 's going to get the woman and , if I had eyes in my head , it was n't Peter Alexia wanted ; it was Craig , and Craig , whatever he admitted and refused to admit , knew it . Besides , Peter Huber was only a friend happening to be there as an innocent bystander does happen to be on the spot and probably wishing heartily he were anywhere else . Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which might have some as yet unsug-  | gested significance ; and somewhere in the history of that long friendship between the Chiverys and the Brents might lie seeds for murder . But again there was no evidence . It had grown dusk as I stood there , although the sky was still light , so I realized later that , on the little ridge and in my swirling cape and hood , I was silhouetted from below against the clear gray light . A lemon-colored star came out above the eastern hills . It was colder , too , so I pulled my cape more tightly around me and pulled the hood over my head . And it was just then that I heard somebody running heavily across the meadow toward me , through the dusk and the bramble . And that was n't all . Something sung sharply through the dusk over my head ; I heard that before I heard the sound of the shot . I literally fell upon my hands and knees behind the stone wall just as both sounds came again . And whoever was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few feet away and began to scramble over it .  | 12 A SINGULAR thing about gun shots is this : no matter how little experience one has had at either the giving or receiving end , one recognizes the sound of a shot with really a peculiar facility and swiftness . And just then another shot sung lower , over my head and over the stone wall . And I knew that that scrambling figure was at least thirty feet from me , but that the shots came from somewhere in the darkening , irregular meadow below , possibly from the wooded valley which seemed to outline the bed of a small stream . I knew too that it was n't the cat shooting at me . But that was about the extent of my knowledge . Whoever had crawled over the stone wall had ducked ; at least no figure emerged from the shadow of rock wall and shrubs . I do n't know what would have happened ; perhaps in the end some car was bound to come along and rescue us . It takes a bold murderer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I was never to know because just then , with a loud whirring of the engine , a small automobile whirled around the bend in the road and  | began to climb the little ridge , its lights streaming ahead of it . So I did what sounds dangerous and really was n't . At least , I do n't believe it was dangerous . I really remember very little of that moment or two during which I crept out , running low in the shelter of the rock wall and into those welcome lights and stopped the car . And it was Dr. Chivery . He leaned out to look at me incredulously as , keeping the car between me and the dusky meadow , I approached him . " Miss Keate . . . " " Somebody 's shooting at me ! From the meadow ! Somebody ... " And just then another figure loomed up from the shelter of the wall and it was the maid Anna . Her face was the color of an underdone muffin and her braids had slipped over one ear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terror in her eyes . She gasped , " Doctor ? please , sir  --  someone 's shooting  --  in the meadow . .. . " Neither Claud Chivery nor I spoke ; in the little glow from the dashlight his chin retreated still further and his slightly popped eyes seemed to take on a kind of reflection of the terror in the maid 's face . Then the maid caught a long , rasping breath and said , still panting , " I mean ? shooting rabbits , I suppose , sir . I  --  I was walking in the meadow , when I  --  I heard someone in the brush along ? along the brook . It  --  it frightened me . I  --  I ran . . . " Her eyes shifted to me and back to the doctor . " And just then  --  as I got to the wall  --  the shots began . I do n't know who it was , sir . But they  --  they often shoot rabbits in the meadow . People from town and  --  and . . . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would you mind taking me back to the house ? I  --  I 'm afraid I 've taken more than my usual afternoon time off . Beevens ... " There was another little pause . Then without a word  | Dr. Chivery reached back , swung open the door to the rear seat of the car and I got in and so did Anna . Still in silence so far as speech went , he turned and reversed and started back for the Brent place . Nobody said anything . There was only the staccato sound of the engine waking echoes along the looming shadows of the hills all around us . He took us all the way to the house , up the winding drive to the front door , where he deposited us . I thanked him and he drove off into the night again with , it seemed to me , that queer reflection of terror still in his eyes . Anna hurried to open the door for me . " Anna . .. " " Yes , Miss Keate . " She had caught her breath now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who was in the meadow ? " " I do n't know , Miss , " she said flatly  --  and defiantly . So I had to let her go . But she knew as well as I did that unless the rabbit had jumped up in front of the gun and barked at him , our hunter was n't shooting at rabbits . It was too dark to have taken a good potshot at anything smaller than a horse ? or a human , silhouetted against the gray sky . Well . I glanced in the morning room and Nicky was sitting there , reading . His back was toward me but his small head and vividly checked coat were unmistakable . His coats were always a little alarming , being made up in very large checks or plaids and in an amazing range of colors  --  that day I believe brown and maroon again predominated . But however I felt about Nicky , it could n't have been Nicky shooting at rabbits or at me . Nobody else was around and , feeling a little shaken by my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off my cape , and again cast my mind back over the few things I knew of the murder of Conrad Brent . But after a while I had to give up ; if those shots had been , by any stretch of the  | imagination , intended to remove me and at the same time any clue in my possession , then I did n't know what that clue was . The only conclusion then was , in a word , rabbits . And since I could n't quite believe this , either , it was only natural that I was a little uneasy . Perhaps wary is more descriptive . But in any case , hunting in the meadow was a good excuse ; it was not unusual , Anna had said . So it was within the realm of possibility that any would-be murderer might count on that . I did n't go in just then to see Drue , for , a little belatedly , I bethought myself of my patient and the fact that he had been presumably alone , with Dr. Chivery dashing about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the meadow . But on the way to his room I stopped and told the trooper on guard in the hall what had happened . I do n't think he believed me ; or perhaps he favored the rabbit theory , for he gave me a rather pitying and indulgent smile . But he did promise to tell Nugent when he saw him . So I went on to Craig 's room where I found Peter Huber with him and both of them talking of Chivery . " Who does Chivery think did it ? " said Peter , as I entered the room and Craig looked at me , said " Hello , Miss Keate , " and replied to Peter . " He says he does n't know . He says it had to be somebody that knew about digitalis . How much to give and how . He says you 've got to give enough to cause a heart block , as it does , right away . If you give too little there are all kinds of symptoms of poisoning  --  nausea and convulsions and  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quick breath and went on hurriedly , as if to hide the pain in his eyes  --  yes , and the grief , for no matter what had happened between Conrad Brent and Craig in their adult life they were still father and son . He said hurriedly , " Claud has been looking it  | up in his reference books . " He frowned . " He says he does n't know who did it . But . . . " " But what , Craig ? " " Oh . Nothing . . . . " He paused again , frowned into space and said , " If only I could get up and about ! If I could even find out who it was that gave me this . . . . " His fingers touched the bandage on his temple . " I did n't see anybody  --  I did n't even hear anything . . . . Look , Pete , scout around a little , will you ? Find out , if you can , exactly who was up and about till midnight or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " " Nothing happened at dinner , " said Peter . " I was there . " A touch of exasperation crossed Craig 's face . " I do n't mean did they throw things at each other or threaten anything . just  --  oh , what did they say and how did they look and  --  oh , hell , " he gave a flounce , and I clutched the light eiderdown as it slid off . " You 'd better go now , Mr. Huber , " I said , eyeing the tinge of scarlet that was coming up in Craig 's lean cheeks . " Wait , not yet , Nurse , " said Craig quickly . " Listen , Pete , keep your eyes open and tell me if you see anything out of the way . And  --  and another thing , " Craig hesitated , shot me an oblique glance and said , " Look through the house and see if you can find some yellow gloves . Loose  --  biggish . Do n't let anybody know and if you find them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay , " he said . And then I sent him away . But Craig said no more of the mysterious yellow gloves and , still aware of that touch of red in his cheeks and the feverish brightness in his eyes , I did n't ask further questions . Dinner for both of us was sent up on a tray ; no one came but the cat again . He meowed hoarsely and when I let him in he went to Craig 's bed , jumped on the foot of  | it , purred loudly and hoarsely , but eluded my hand and Craig 's and went to sleep , with his slitted grape-green eyes opening now and then to look at the door into the hall . It was only a wary look , though , normal one to one of Delphine 's pessimistic nature , nothing like the silent , listening stare of the previous night . Eventually I folded up like an accordion on the couch again . I thought a little pensively of the bed in my room which looked very comfortable . Nothing happened that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter and Nicky went for a long night walk , for I happened past the stairway as they left and had a glimpse of Nicky 's dark head and Peter 's broad shoulders and leather jacket just as they closed the front door behind them . Later , because the house was so still , I heard their return . Or rather , I heard Peter 's return ; Nicky apparently got tired and returned first . I saw him as he passed Craig 's room , for the door was a little ajar , on his way apparently to Alexia 's room , and a moment later I saw him return . He glanced in both times and smiled airily , and looked exactly like a beautiful inquisitive young leopard on the prowl . It was much later when I heard Peter 's return and by that time I had closed the bedroom door . There was no chance to talk to Drue . Once or twice during the night I glanced into the hall . Mr. Wilkins or his double sat in a chair just outside her door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The police were about , for I saw them from my window , prowling through the grounds , and later Nugent questioned me about the affair in the meadow , so the trooper was as good as his word and had reported the shooting to him . The Lieutenant questioned me , too , again as to what or whom I had seen in the hall just after the odd little bump on the door , the night of the murder .  | This time I thought he believed me when I told him again that I had n't seen anyone . But something to my alarm he suggested a motive for the shots of the previous night . " Perhaps someone believed that you had seen more than you were willing , publicly , to admit . You gave me that impression , too . The way you stopped in the middle of a sentence . " " But I saw nothing ! Besides , no one last night could have known I would be just there , above the meadow . " " Well . Can you suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Rabbits , " I said weakly , and Nugent said , " No doubt . But I 'd not go for a walk alone again . " He went away , then , leaving me with mixed emotions . Chiefly it seemed a good idea to hang a placard on my back with the words on it , " I know nothing , " which seemed just then a redundancy . Alexia telephoned that morning to Bergdof 's for a full mourning outfit , and I believe Maud assisted the police in going through the papers in Conrad 's desk and in the safe . It was that morning , too , that reporters ar rived ; Chivery and Nicky saw them . Later one of the papers had a picture of Dr. Chivery caught , apparently , as he was stepping into his car in front of his own whitepicketed gate . his face , twisted over his shoulder , had a curious expression ; there was a hunted , hag-ridden look about his eyes , taken unaware like that . Or it may have been the camera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her graduating picture which someone had discovered . She looked very young and very lovely , her eyes steady and uncompromising above the stern severity of the Bishop collar our nurses have to wear on state occasions . Some of the papers made much of her brief marriage to Craig . " Nurse 's  | Secret Romance " said one paper . But very few facts of evidence appeared , so I judged Nugent held his cards close to his belt , as a poker-playing patient of mine used to say . None of the papers , however , reached us until after the next morning 's train , which was just as well . And the reporters soon left . Naturally , all that day I was like a hound on a leash about the hypodermic and still had to wait , what with the police there , to say nothing of Maud , Alexia and Nicky , and the maids cleaning the rooms . Craig 's condition was good , so far as the wound went ; but there was a kind of nervous , fine-drawn look about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , watching the door . The police did not question Drue again that morning ; she told me that when I went , about eleven , to her room . She was very pale and there were faint blue marks under her eyes . She wore a fresh white uniform like a signal of defiance and had touched her mouth with lipstick and brushed her soft , shining curls upward with a clean , childish sweep from her temples , but she could not hide the look in her dark gray eyes . We talked until I had to go back to Craig , but without any real or helpful conclusion . She asked about Craig and some of the shadow in her eyes seemed to lessen when I told her he was better . She sent no message , however . About one-thirty , Soper came to tell Craig there was to be an inquest that afternoon and to ask him if he knew a Frederic Miller . " Inquest ? " cried Craig . " Look here , Miss Cable ought to have a lawyer 's advice before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " snapped Soper looking sulky . " She 's not to be asked to testify now . The doctor 's the  | only necessary witness just now . And Nugent . What I 'd like you to tell me now is , who is Frederic Miller ? Your father has given him checks totaling fifteen thousand dollars in the last two years . You must know . . . " " But I do n't ! There 's nobody . . . See here , I do n't understand ! " " Never heard the name before ? " The District Attorney 's eyes were little and suspicious . " Never ! And I do n't think my father knew anybody by that name ! " Craig looked honestly perplexed . " Did you ask Alexia  --  Mrs. Brent ? " " Certainly . She knew nothing of it either . Have n't any idea who it was that struck you that night ? " His eyes were on the bandage still on Craig 's temple . " No . " " Are you sure it was anybody ? You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Craig . " I was in the hall . Some , body hit me and dragged me into the linen room . So it must have been a man . " " Not at all . A woman could have done it easily . Good morning , " said the District Attorney and went away looking remarkably like a stuffed frog . And as he left Nicky came . I remained , in spite of the look Nicky gave me , which plainly invited me to leave . He was still limping a little . " Hurt your foot , Nick ? " said Craig and Nicky said , " Someone dropped a flashlight on it , in the ruckus the other night . Accidentally , I hope , " and glanced at me and lowered his silky eyelashes so there was only a halfhidden but definitely malicious gleam back of them . I looked blank , as if I 'd never heard of a flashlight and Nicky said , " Craig , look here . Ought n't we to do some-thing ? " " Do something ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's either a mo  | tive or it 's a question of a  --  a homicidal maniac . I 've given it a lot of thought , and that 's my conclusion . " " It 's in the hands of the police , " said Craig . " They 'll do everything they can . " " But , Craig , " said Nicky , leaning forward suddenly , his pointed elegant face jutting into the light , " do you know who did it ? " " No , " said Craig . And added as bluntly , " Do you ? " " N-no , " said Nicky slowly . " That is  --  of course the police think it was Drue . " " Thanks to your evidence against her . " " I did n't tell them everything I could have told them , " said Nicky slowly and in a curiously tentative way . " What do you mean ? " " Oh . Their conversation , for instance . Conrad 's , I mean , and Drue 's , just before he died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean ? I suppose you listened . " Nicky shrugged ; it was again tentative , only halfassenting . " Well , " said Craig , " what did you hear ? " If the library door had been closed , I did n't think he had heard anything , for it was extraordinarily thick and solid . Still , it might not have been quite closed . Certainly Nicky 's handsome face looked extraordinarily disingenuous , almost , indeed , naive . Naive like a rattlesnake , I thought abruptly . And listened . Nicky hesitated then lifted his elegantly squared and tailored shoulders again . " Think it over , Craig , " he said . " You did n't hear anything , " said Craig . " And if you did , it 's nothing to me . " " Drue is nothing to you ? " said Nicky softly . " You heard me . " Nicky 's bland face changed a little ; his cruel lower lip  | protruded . He got up . " I see it 's no use to talk to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorce is still in good standing , I presume ? " Craig 's straight , dark eyebrows made a line across his face . " What do you mean exactly ? " " Oh , nothing , " said Nicky airily . " Except Drue is in circulation again . Prettier than ever . I 'd forgotten " ? he stopped , laughed a little and said ? " well , no  --  not quite forgotten . After all , she did leave you once and I daresay you remember why . So if she is absolutely free . . . Craig said shortly , " Drue is perfectly free . As you know , Nicky . Now get out . " When he 'd gone , somewhat hurriedly , Craig lay for a long time looking at nothing , with a very grim expression . Late in the afternoon Alexia came . She looked very beautiful and not at all like a recently bereaved widow , in a handsome tea-gownish dress , emerald green and trailing . It seemed to me that Craig 's jaw set itself a little rigidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me away , which I must say was rather disappointing . Drue was sitting at the writing table when I reached her room but was n't writing . Sir Francis lay like a little brown muff on the table beside her , his head on her arm . " Sit down , Sarah . What happened ? Did Dr. Chivery drive you away again ? " " Alexia , this time , " I said a little grimly . " Oh , Alexia . " Her eyelids went down and she patted the little dog 's vigilant head . And said suddenly , looking at the dog , her voice quite clear but completely without expression , " He 's in love with her , you know . I suppose now  --  after a decent interval  --  they 'll marry . " Well , if Alexia had anything to say about it , it was more likely to be an indecent interval . I repressed my evil nature to the extent of not saying it , and she went  | on , " I was wrong about everything . I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I said , energetically if ambiguously , " Nonsense . " " No . It is n't nonsense . You see , I know . He 's still in love with her , Sarah . Nicky says so . Besides I  --  know ... " She took up a pen and traced a circle with it slowly . " I 'd better tell you , Sarah . I think that 's what started everything . Alexia and Craig , I mean . You see  --  Alexia was in the garden with Craig a few minutes before he was shot . Nicky told me . And I think " ? mindful of the trooper outside her door , she whispered ? " I think Conrad shot him . " " Shot Craig ! " " Sh . He 'll hear you . " " But  --  you mean Conrad was jealous ? " " Conrad made a kind of fetish of being old-fashioned , " she said slowly . " And he was in love with Alexia . " " If his father shot Craig in a fit of jealousy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's true . " I was struck by a sudden memory . " Was that why you told Conrad you had found his revolver in the garden ? " " Yes . I knew it was his revolver ; at least I knew he had one . And I knew him . I did n't know what had happened ? I do n't really know now . But I thought  --  you see , I was afraid . For Craig . If his father had shot him in a fit of jealousy , I wanted him to realize the horrible thing he 'd done . Everyone else , I knew  --  Craig himself , and Claud and anybody else who knew or guessed the truth , ? would try to cover it . Conrad was defiant ; he said I could n't have found it where I did find it . He said I was trying to blackmail him into letting me stay . But I was n't  --  I really was n't , Sarah . I never thought of it . " I knew that . And Conrad 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already knew of the revolver , for , if he did n't , his normal reaction ought to have been to start an immediate investigation .  | Yet , again , I could n't believe it . " No , Drue , it 's impossible ! I ca n't think jealousy over Alexia would so blind Conrad . Do n't believe Nicky . Do n't believe anything he tells you . He 's in love with you himself . . . . " Nicky in love with me ! " She laughed shortly . " But why then  --  Drue , he asked Craig if you were perfectly free . From your marriage to Craig , he meant . " " He asked Craig that ? " " Yes . " She did n't look at me . " What did Craig say ? " " Nothing , " I said hurriedly , perceiving shoals too late . " What did he say ? " she repeated . So I said reluctantly , " He only said that your divorce was final . But , my dear . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct of Craig . And Nicky . " " You ca n't really think of marrying Nicky ! " " He has n't asked me . But if he does , why not ? " she said , and began making circles again , rapid ones now , jabbing the pen into the blotter . " But . . . " Her mouth and chin were set , there were two scarlet spots on her checks . I stopped and took another course . " Drue , you said you intended to find out what really happened here . When Craig came back , I mean , at the time you left this house and went back to New York . And Conrad said Craig wanted a divorce . Did you ? " " It 's too late for that . " I was about to say tritely and not at all truly that it is never too late . But she flung down the pen . " It 's too late , Sarah ! I was a fool to try it . I . . . " The abrupt motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pebbles intended to hold the pen that rolled across the desk . And we both looked just as a little  | pasteboard box fell out upon the desk amid a shower of colored pebbles . It was a medicine box ; there was the prescription sign and Conrad 's name and Dr. Chivery 's and directions and it held digitalis . Rather it had held digitalis . It was empty now , for I picked it up and opened it .  | 13 DRUE had made one quick , stifled motion to snatch the box , but I had it in my hand . " Drue . . . " It was dreadful to see the color simply drain out of her face until she looked like a ghost . " I found it , " she whispered . " Sarah , I ca n't tell you . I ca n't tell you any more . I 've said too much now . Do n't ask me  --  do n't . . . " She stopped . And put her face down on her arms and against the little dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sobs , as if every one of them fought against her will . I think I put my hand on her shoulder . She said , in a stifled way , " Go away . It 's all right , Sarah . Only go away . Please . " Drue never cried ; it was n't her way of facing trouble . After a moment I went . I took the medicine box with me ; I had to . And I had to try to think , not that up to then I had got very far in that direction . But first I hid the little flat box in a handkerchief and pinned it inside the blouse of my uniform with a good , strong safety pin . It turned me cold to think of the danger it had been to Drue . But there was only one explanation for her pos-  | session of the box , for her tears , for her refusal to explain it to me , and that was that she was protecting someone . There was a corollary to that , too ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , why had n't she destroyed the box ? And did she have some reason to believe that Craig had killed his father ? As Soper had said , there is really no alibi for a poison murder . Craig could have done it by ingeniously ( how , I did n't know ) using his father 's own medicine , fixing it ( somehow ) so he knew his father would take the poison that night , and at the same time ( by faking an accident on the previous night , really shooting himself ) arranging an alibi for himself that could n't be shaken . An alibi that covered actually twenty-four hours ( and might easily be made to cover much more than that ) thus allowing a margin of time . So that if , say , he had put poison in the brandy ( or in anything else his father was in the habit of taking ) it did n't matter when Conrad voluntarily took the stuff , for Craig still had an alibi . The flaw was his wound ; nobody in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he could ( with exactly the same effect ) wound himself less dangerously and less painfully . And I still did n't believe Craig had killed his father  --  but Drue was afraid he had , because she believed Craig had a motive . I saw that , then ; she believed that Conrad had shot Craig , so Craig 's motive might be self-defense , or it might be a long-standing jealousy between the two men over Alexia ! When I reached that point , I got up and put on my cape . I had to get outdoors . I had to reach some sensible conclusion about that box and Drue and Craig . In the hall , as I was starting for a walk , I met Anna . She had an enormous black eye , a perfect mass of black and green and purple bruises . I stared and she said quickly , " I ran into a door , Miss . " " Really , Anna . Dear me. "  | " Yes , Miss . " Of course one does encounter a door sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and there is almost always a sharp red line on the eyebrow made by the edge of the door . I said , " You 're sure you did n't see anyone in the meadow last night ? " " Yes , Miss . That is , no . I did n't see anyone but you . " Certainly I had n't given her a black eye . But I could n't think of anyone who might have done it , either . With the possible exception of Delphine who was of a jaundiced enough nature but much more likely to scratch . However , I persisted . " I thought you might have seen someone in the meadow . Someone you were afraid to tell the police about . " But she did n't blush or show any change of expression ; she just stood there neat and respectable in her long black uniform and white apron a : . a cap . " No , Miss , " she said stolidly . But Nugent had been sufficiently impressed by my story of the shooting to question Anna . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been someone hunting  --  last night , you know . Someone from the town , perhaps . He searched the house and he says the only guns in the house that anyone knows about belonged to Mr. Brent . A revolver , " she said flatly , " which the police took from Miss Drue 's room yesterday . And a shotgun which has n't been fired for a long time . They said they could tell . So you see , Miss , I  --  I was right . " " I see , Anna . " Her eye looked terribly painful . " Try alternate hot and cold packs for your eye , " I told her and went for a walk . I had walked along the driveway down to the public road , meeting no one , deep in thought of Drue and the little medicine box , before it occurred to me that if I had been the possible if extremely unwilling target for gunshots the previous evening , I might well be again . This  | time perhaps more successfully from the hunter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusk again and the February landscape was very quiet and deserted , but there were plenty of little thickets of brush and evergreens , to say nothing of the opportunities for concealment offered by the walls and hedges . So I turned back , but before I had gone more than a dozen steps , Peter Huber came along in a long and very handsome gray coupe and stopped . He 'd been to the inquest , he said , leaning bareheaded from the car . " Is everything all right at the house ? " I told him yes , and that Alexia was staying with Craig while I took a rest . " Good , " he said cheerfully . " How about a little ride ? I 'll tell you , we 'll drive back to the village and get a drink . Hop in . " It suited me perfectly , for I wanted to hear about the inquest . So I got in beside him , looking with rather stunned admiration at the inconceivably luxurious car . It did n't have platinum handles and diamonds set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He saw me looking at it . " A beauty , is n't it ? " he said , backing expertly and swiftly so as to head the long gray hood toward the village . " My means do n't run to cars like this , though . It 's Alexia 's . " His voice did n't caress her name in loverly fashion , certainly ; but then there was no reason why it should , even if , as Craig had hinted , he was actually rather infatuated with her . Craig had n't said how he knew , but then one can usually tell these things about people one knows very well , without words and without definite proof ; it 's something in the eyes , something in the air . But it occurred to me that if Peter intended to wait , discreetly , until he could press his suit with propriety , then he was reckoning without Alexia 's singular directness . In any case , whether or not there was anything in what  | Craig had told me , certainly both Peter Huber and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , were yet inexorably and inextricably bound up with the things that had happened there . I sighed a little at that thought and he glanced at me . " Tired ? They 've kept you going . I do n't suppose you 've really rested since Conrad died . Well , since before that really . What with Craig sick and all the goings on before Conrad died . " " There were n't . .. Oh , you mean the bump on the door and seeing Nicky ? " " Seeing . . . " The car swerved toward the stone wall at the edge of the road , jerked back to the middle , and Peter said , " What do you mean ? Was it Nicky you saw in the hall when you opened the door ? " " No , no . I did n't see anybody . I opened the door after there was that  --  well , bump against it . But not right away . So whoever went past the door , carrying Heaven knows what , was out of sight by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he was n't doing anything , really . Just coming out of some room along the hall . " " Oh , " said Peter . " I thought the way you spoke you had seen Nicky in the hall . " " No , no ( Not then . " Nickyl If he 'd hurried , the night before , taking a short cut through the meadow to the house , he might possibly have arrived before me . In any case I made it clear . " I did n't see Nicky then . It was earlier . " Suddenly I remembered Conrad 's white starched shirt front and black tie . " Nicky must have changed after dinner again . Unless lie did n't change for dinner . Do you remember ? " " Do I  --  oh , I see what you mean . " He frowned , seemed to think back and said , " Why , yesl He wore a dinner jacket at dinner that night . So did Conrad ; he always did . I changed , too . But I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been my room you saw Nicky come from ; he 'd  | been in to get a book I was reading . And I remember now , he had changed back to , I think , tweeds ; a brown checked coat , anyway . But I . . . " He drove in silence for a moment , watching the road ahead . " I thought nothing of it then . And I do n't see now that it makes any difference . " " Well , " I said , " I do n't either . " We had already topped the ridge where I stood the previous night ; now we turned into the main traveled road . We could see the village ahead , very snug and peaceful and rather distant in the gentle dusk . And then all at once , neither of us speaking , we were there . The little main street lengthened , the white houses attained sudden height , and we turned and parked along a street of small , low-roofed shops , in front of a small haberdashery , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spoke to him . " Evening , Mr. Huber . " " Hello . " " Hear there was an inquest this afternoon . " The man 's eyes were curious . " Yes , " said Peter shortly and helped me out . " H 'm , " said the clerk and , as Peter offered no comment but steered me along the sidewalk in the direction of the inn ( a long , sprawled , white building with the sign Coach Inn , 1782 , hanging above its door ) , the clerk called after us , " You look fine , Mr. Huber . Glad the things fit . " " Oh , thanks , " said Peter . " Yes , they were all right . " " I 'll never forget what you looked like when you came to the store that morning , " added the clerk with a chuckle that carried clearly through the winter twilight and silence of the little street . Peter grinned back at the chatty ( and curious ) clerk and we crossed the narrow white porch of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We went along a dark passage so narrow that my cape brushed the walls and entered the tap room , all smoke-stained rafters  | and age . Aside from nearly braining myself on a low rafter , I reached a table without misadventure and looked around me . Except for the bartender , no one else was there  --  or at least I could see no one , although the highbacked settles along the side walls cut off my view of one corner of the room . Beside the bar was the kind of machine where one drops in nickels ( or dimes or quarters , if one is really just a gambler at heart ) and takes what comes , if anything . With this machine it had to be nickels . It was very quiet ; I had had a kind of expectation of some kind of repercussion from the inquest , but if the police or Soper were still in town , I saw and heard nothing of them then . The bartender knew Peter , too . He came forward , wiping his hands . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I guess we 'll have a  --  what do you want , Miss Keate ? " I took ginger ale . Peter ordered whisky and soda . And suddenly the bartender chuckled much as the haberdashery clerk had chuckled . " You certainly look different , Mr. Huber , " lie said . " Ever find your baggage ? " " No , " said Peter . " Guess it 's gone forever . " " Too had . You looked as if you 'd been shipwrecked , " the bartender laughed . " Felt like it , too , " said Peter . He unbuttoned his short leather jacket , untied the white scarf around his throat and said , " Anybody been in here from the inquest , John ? " The bartender 's face sobered instantly . " That 's a bad business , Mr. Huber , " he said . " First murder in Balifold since  --  well , I ca n't remember another and I 've been here a long time . Ginger ale for you , Miss ? And whisky and soda . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands . " I lost my baggage , " he said ruefully . " I arrived here in what  | amounted to fancy dress . The natives ca n't forget it . They all but burst into hysterics whenever they see me . " If he was trying to divert me , he did n't succeed . " You were at the inquest , then , " I said . " What hap-pened ? " " Nothing , really , " he said , staring at the bare table and biting his knuckles . " They did n't intend anything to happen , I suppose . It was a formality . Dr. C:hivery was there ; he and the police doctor both testified as to what they had found . The police testified , too  --  that is , Nugent and one of the troopers . Then they had the lawyer that had drawn up Brent 's will tell something of its contents . I suppose that was only to show that Brent was a rich man and that there might have been a motive for his murder . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or about all . They adjourned then . " " Then they said nothing of  --  of Drue ? " He shook his head , rubbed his hands across his thick , curly blond hair and then put them flat on the table . " Not a word . And Soper ca n't ask for a Grand jury indictment until after the inquest reconvenes and delivers a verdict . Or so they tell me . So Drue is safe till then . They had to hold an inquest in order to give the police a kind of ticket to go ahead . Soper can go back now to the county seat or wherever his office is . And Nugent stays here and goes on with the investigation , calling on Soper whenever he needs him . The inquest ca n't be concluded , I understood , until they have more evidence . There could n't be a verdict , but they made no bones of calling it murder . " The bartender ambled toward us and set our glasses on the table . Peter cupped his hand around his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go and hear what was said , so I went . She did n't want to go herself . " He took a long drink , put down his glass and said unex-  | pectedly , " He had really a lot of money . Conrad , I mean . And it wo n't come to Drue , so that ought to help out your little friend . I mean , she had n't money for a motive . " He looked very gloomy . I said , a little gloomily myself , " Unless they think she hoped to remarry Craig and thus get money . That is , if Craig does inherit . " " Oh , yes , he inherits . Conrad would n't have cut him off ; Conrad was strong on family , you know . A little cracked really on the subject . Had all kinds of grandiose ideas . " " Yes , I know , " I said dryly , remembering what Conrad had said of Drue . " Anybody 's wife , yes , " said Conrad , " but not my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have felt that Alexia fitted into his family particularly well . " Peter glanced quickly at me , and I felt the way you do when you 've said something that sounds more disagreeable than you meant it , and a man gives you that look of " **33;578;TOOLONG . " He said slowly , " Perhaps he married her because Craig had as good as jilted her . The honor of the family  --  all ghat . " " Nonsense , " I said . " He was in love with her ; he . I hesitated and then went rashly on , " Perhaps he 'd been in love with her , really , without knowing it , for a long time . But that does n't matter , anyway , and it 's nothing to me . " " Nor to me , " said Peter , and added thoughtfully , " But there 's Mrs. Chivery . An extremely handsome and brilliant woman . I sliould have thought somebody like  --  well , like Mrs. Chivery , would have attracted Conrad . " " Mrs. Chivery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said hurriedly . " It 's only that she 's very  --  well , attractive , you know . " I stared at hiin . He had a pleasant face ; his calm blue eyes were well spaced above high , rather sharp cheekbones ; his blunt chin and his wide mouth and thick blond eyebrows suggested a certain uncompromising  | strength . He was no Adonis , certainly , but he was not bad-looking , either . And I was visited by a more or less fantastic idea . Perhaps it was Maud he 'd fallen in love with and not Alexia , so Craig was right in guessing his emotional temperature , so to speak , but wrong in his diagnosis of its cause . True , Maud was at least twenty to twenty-five years older than he , but what with all the liberties playwrights and scientists are taking with time these days , that might not make so much difference . Time might be actually a sheer question of relativity ; and I might be skipping rope again at any moment . Which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semblance of common sense . Peter said , " Chivery knew about Conrad 's will ; we sat together and before the inquest began he told me about it . Dr. Chivery himself inherits fifty thousand dollars . " " Fifty . . . Good gracious ! " " They were old friends . And Mrs. Chivery managed the house for Conrad for years . Until he married Alexia . Then there were a few bequests to servants , something like five thousand to the butler , small sums to the others . The library rug was willed to a museum . A blessing , that ; it ought never to have been put on the floor . There were smallish sums to one or two charities . The rest was divided between Craig and Alexia . " So Alexia had that for a motive . But if money were a motive for murder then it was widespread , for it included everyone . Everyone except  --  suddenly I remembered Nicky . " Nothing to Nicky Senour ? " " No . But Nicky 'd already had his share . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He . . . Peter said , in a matter-of-fact way , " The police have already got to that . For two years or so Conrad has been paying Nicky Senour fairly substantial sums . At irregular intervals . By check . "  | If that was true then Nicky Senour had every motive to keep Conrad alive . Peter went on calmly , " But I do n't think that it was blackmail . " It . . . " His head jerked around and his eyes fastened on something behind me . I had n't heard a sound or a rustle , but Peter got quickly to his feet . And I turned around just as Maud Chivery emerged from the high-backed settle in the corner . She wore a long black cloak and no hat on that neat , high , black pompadour . She floated toward us , noiselessly , her small white face suspended above that black cloak , her bright , peering eyes upon us . The bartender materialized too , beside us , but more noisily . " That 'll be for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Peter began to dig quickly into his pocket . Maud said to Peter , " I thought Claud would come in here after the inquest . I wanted to know what happened . " ( I thought , parenthetically , that she had heard that , and some other things too . ) She went on quickly , " Have you seen him ? " " Ile left the inquest a few minutes before it was adjourned , " said Peter . " Ten or fifteen minutes before , I imagine . I do n't know where he went . " " Oh , " said Maud . " Well , then I 'll go home with you , if you do n't mind . " She folded her cloak around her , fixed her bright dark eyes upon Peter and said , " Are you sure about the money ? Conrad 's money , I mean . Does n't any of it come direct to me ? " " Dr. Chivery told me the money comes to him , " said Peter . " But Conrad must have meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set tightly . " Yes . Yes , " she said with an odd effect of resolution , as if she were casting a vote or making a vow . She pulled her cloak closer around her and let Peter pay for her drinks and I got up and prepared to go . I did n't leap to the conclusion that Maud Chivery was a dipsomaniac because she chose to retire to the depths of Balifold 's bar for a little private drinking .  | I did think that in spite of her clear speech , her eyes were a little glassy . And I thought too that it was time for me to go back to the Brent house . On the way out I stopped at the slot machine . Peter and Maud had gone on ahead when rather unexpectedly I found that my fingers had explored the pocket of my cape and found a nickel . So I put it in a slit in the machine and then , as directions said to do , turned a kind of crank . I can see why these instruments have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nickels shot out of the machine . Being unprepared , I did n't catch all the nickels and they went everywhere , rolling merrily on the floor . Peter and Maud came back quickly in a startled manner , and . helped me gather up nickels . At least Peter did . Although I 'm not sure that Maud did n't pick up one or two in spite of her aloof attitude , but , if she did , she did n't give them to me . But it was owing to the nickels ( and perhaps a little to the brandy she 'd drunk while waiting for Claud Chivery ) that Maud said just what she said . Peter had pursued several spinning little disks behind the bar and he and the bartender were talking . And Maud leaned over toward me , touched the nickels in my cupped hands with positively loving fingers and said suddenly and low , her face all at once aglow , " Money ? gold , silver , jewels . I 'm going to have lots of money , soon . As soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All behind the church . " " Ch  --  church ! " I said in a kind of gasp , clutching nickels . And Maud nodded briskly and brightly , with a shimmering hard glaze over her eyes . " ' Truckloads of jewels . Spanish . Castles in Spain  --  my castles in Spain . . . " she said in a dry whisper . And then Peter came back with the last of the nickels . I did n't have time then to count them ; we went directly  | out to the car , Peter laughing a little and Maud suddenly as silent and uncommunicative as a little black shadow . As well she might be , I thought a little tersely , if brandy affected her like that . Castles in Spain and truckloads of jewels ! Truckloads . Well , really ! In the car the odors of brandy and Maud 's violet sachet were quite marked . It developed shortly , however , that she had an errand at her own house and Peter offered to take her there and bring her back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Maud . So they let me out at the corner where the main road to Balifold branched onto- the road past the Brent place . " You 're sure you do n't mind ? " said Peter politely and , when I had to say I did n't , Maud said suddenly , " There 's a short cut to the house through the meadow ; you 'll see the path just beyond the wall . " So I got out and stood there , weighed down with nickels , watching the red tail-light of the czar disappear along the main road south and east , in the direction of the Chivery cottage . And I did n't at all fancy the walk I had so airily undertaken , simply because I did n't want to refuse and then explain why . My road wound westward , skirting the northern wall of the meadow , and then , still winding , southward and eventually reached the Brent gate . A path through the meadow would be roughly the hypotenuse of the triangle and much shorter . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woodland and brush ; I did n't like the dense strip of brush and trees outlining the little valley of the brook ; I did n't like the time of day . I remembered too well the hunter of the previous night , and I still did n't think it was rabbits . Yet I could n't stand there in the chill , silent loneliness of the approaching night . And the road must be nearly twice as long a way as the path . So in the end I scrambled over the wall and took the  | path . I guessed it would come out somewhere about the garage and kitchen end of the Brent house . Until I had got quite a distance into the meadow I did n't realize exactly how dark it was . I went along hurriedly , my ill-gotten gains making a small chinking sound in my pockets . The meadow was rocky and the path twisted around weed-grown boulders and up and down tiny valleys and mounds ; I had n't realized either , looking at it from the road , how irregular the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strip of dark shadow which seemed to edge the brook . What , really , had Anna run from , the night before ? The meadow , the strip of woods and thickets down by the brook were all clothed now in silence and in dusk . The sky was dark again and there were no stars and only a faint purple glow of lingering daylight in the west . Once , somewhere in the shadowy distance , it seemed to me there was a kind of rustle and crackle of twigs , but when I stopped to listen there was nothing . The path entered the strip of trees and sloped downward toward the brook . A twig caught at my cape and I jerked it away with a sharp tug , as if it had been fingers . And then I stumbled . Something was in the path , lying like a sack in the middle of it . I fell on one knee , flinging out my hands to save myself , my cape swirling around me . My hand encountered the sack . Only it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were wet with a kind of stickiness . I knew by that viscous stickiness what was on them . I leaned over , trying not to touch him again . The twilight was deep but still I could make out the outlines of Dr. Chivery 's anxious face and popping eyes , for once fixed and direct . His throat had been cut . Then I heard again a rustle and snapping of twigs . This time it was clear and definite . This time I knew what it was .  | It was the soft sound of something moving in the dense brush beyond the brook , on the slope between me and the Brent house . As I listened it stopped . There was just silence and night coming on and the bloody thing at my feet .  | 14 WITH every second it was growing darker ; I do n't know how long I listened like that , but it seemed all at once fully dark . There was no further sound from the thickets on the slope ahead . And I had to get to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my cape , spilling nickels . There was nothing I or anyone could do now for Claud Chivery . And I was afraid . All at once I started to run  --  back , along the way I had come , for I could n't follow the path into those shadowy thickets where something had moved . I ran as Anna had run , gasping for breath , listening behind me , running . Eventually , after an eon of time , I reached the wall and nothing came out of that black and haunted meadow behind me . Then I was on the public road and I still had to circle ( on the road now ) around that dark and horrible meadow in order to reach the house . Yet nothing , really , seemed to have a meaning except the hard-packed , winding road , the loud sound of my feet upon it , the dark lines of wall and hedges , the trees on either hand , the silence of the night sky above . It was as if I was suspended in a strange and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever known , aware only of the road  --  and the grotesque and horrible thing I 'd left in the little thicket , flung down like an empty sack . Well , I got to the gateposts which loomed sudden and huge in the dusk . I could then see the lights of the Brent house , glimmering through the trees . My throat and lungs smarted and stung . Yet I was horribly watchful and aware of the shadows and shrubs along the driveway . But there was a light in the hall ; the manycolored stained glass window was garish above me . The door was unlocked , for I flung it open . And fell , literally , into Beevens ' arms . He caught me and his face seemed instantly to sharpen , so lines stood out and it turned the color of skim milk . I knew I was talking , trying to tell him . He cried , " Dr. Chivery  --  Dr. Chivery . . . " Someone else said , " Where ? Where ? " sharply , and there was a flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gown , came hurrying from the door of the library . Nicky floated into my vision too and seemed to have followed Alexia . Then Anna came from somewhere , and it was Anna who screamed Get back to the kitchen . Shut up . " Someone  --  Nicky  --  was helping me to a chair . Beevens ran to the telephone beyond the stairway and Alexia was telling him what to say , her pointed face a white , vehement mask . And then the trooper ( Drue 's guard ; not Wilkins but another man ) came running into the library , and wrested the telephone from Beevens ' hand . " I heard youl I heard everything . Are you sure he 's dead ? What happened exactly ? Operator , operator . . . He jiggled the hook and I tried to reply and he finally  | got the police . Alexia came back . " Where is Peter ? " she cried . " Have you seen him ? Where is he ? " " I do n't know . Yes , I do . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Maud Chivery . In the car . They left me at the corner . Someone was on the meadow  --  do n't you see  --  someone was there ! Tell them that . " The trooper was already shouting the news of murder ( " Another murderl Dr. Chivery ! In the north meadow down by the brook . .. " ) presumably into Nugent 's distant ear . We all listened . " She does n't know who did it . Well , that 's what she says . Just now , five minutes ago . No , the Cable girl 's still in her room . .. " Alexia looked at Nicky and Nicky looked at Alexia in utter silence , as if they did n't need words ; it was a secret look , communicative , with a kind of mutual question and answer . It was baffling , for I could feel those elements in it , yet there was nothing I could really interpret . The trooper said , " Okay  --  okay  --  okay , " and emerged into the hall again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . I 'd never noticed what big and extraordinarily substantial-looking revolvers the troopers wore strapped to their trim waists , until I noticed the revolver this one held poised in his hand . He said , " Do n't leave the house , any of you , " and ran into the hall and up to the landing where he stopped instead of at Drue 's door . It was evidently an order from Nugent and it was a fairly strategic spot , for he could see the whole of the lower hall and part of the upper . " Alexia looked down at me . " Do you know who did it ? " " No . No .. . " Nicky said , almost dreamily , " Claud  --  well , he must have got in somebody 's way . " " Suicide , " said Alexia , all at once . " It must have been suicide ! " And Nicky said sharply , leaning over me , " What 's she got on her hands ? "  | " I fell  --  I told you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I began jerkily . Alexia and Nicky drew a little together and just looked at me , so their faces , so alike , and the eyes shining from behind those long silky eyelashes , were almost like one face , seen in duplicate , with one expression . It was Beevens who came forward , clucked disapprovingly and exactly like a hen when he saw my hands and said , " This way , Nurse . You 'll want to wash them . " I followed Beevens through the library and into the narrow little washroom adjoining it . There was soap there and I scrubbed my hands and then saw a small stain on the hem of my white skirt and I took that out with cold water too and shook myself and felt better . Although I 'd lost my cap somewhere . Probably in the woodland and the police would find it and say I killed him . And then I thought of Craig . Alexia had n't been with him , she 'd been downstairs and in the library . So he was alone . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Alexia and Nicky were talking . " Beevens said Maud walked into town about threethirty this afternoon ; she said she would wait in town and come home with Claud after the inquest . The inquest took place in the hotel , " Alexia was saying . " But she must have missed him , " said Nicky . " Otherwise she and Claud would have come home together . " He turned to me . " You said , did n't you , that Peter took her home in the car ? " " Yes . " I went to the couch to gather up my cape . " I rode into town with Mr. Huber ; we went into the bar and Mrs. Chivery was there . " " Maud ? " cried Alexia . " Claud must have walked from town , " said Nicky . " He often does . And he must have intended to stop here ; everybody takes the short cut through the meadow . " Alexia said , " Somebody 's got to tell Maud . I 'll tele-  | phone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unperturbed . I said , " It 's going to be a shock , " and looked at her trailing green tea gown  --  not a costume for walking in the meadow . Yet Chivery had been dead for some time when I found him , so she or anybody else would have had time to get home and change . And just at that moment I suspected anybody and everybody in the house , even Anna and Beevens and Craig . But Drue had an alibi ; she 'd been under police guard . And now they 'd release her , for this proved , did n't it , that she had n't murdered Conrad ! For , as Craig had said , simply on the basis of averages and logic , there were n't likely to be two murderers , mysteriously converging in our midst . At that thought and its implications I took a long and thankful breath . Alexia had reached the door when Nicky said , " You 'd better let me do it . I 'll have Peter bring her here . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly toward the stairway . The trooper let me pass ; he did n't speak or try to stop me ; it was his presence there ( uniformed , armed , waiting because he had to , alert as a coiled spring with only the excitement in his eyes betraying the man ) that was a threat of power to come . Investigation , evidence , accusation . One attempt at murder : Craig . One murder by poison : difficult to prove . One murder by stabbing . Outright , cold-blooded , horribly feral . Wolfish . Drue 's door was unguarded and I wanted to go to her , but that would have to come later . I hurried to Craig 's room ; the door was open and he was sitting bolt upright , wrapped in a dressing gown , in the chair near the fireplace . His eyes blazed at me ; his face was stiff and white . And I knew by the look on it , that he already knew . He said , " Shut the door . "  | I did . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . . . ? " " Come here . Put down your cape . Sit down  --  no , over here on the couch . Tell me about Claud . I heard the trooper at the telephone , and you when you came in the door . I know Claud was murdered . " " But you . . . " " Listen , " he said savagely . " I 'm up . It did n't hurt me to get up . Nobody let me ; it was my own idea . And as soon as you tell me everything about Claud I 'll go back to bed . Not an instant sooner . " Well , there was no use struggling over it ; I was still shaky and my knees were unsteady . I just sat there looking at him and wishing I could smack him and above everything else not really caring much about anything , I was so tired . And he said suddenly , in a less hard and terse way , " You 'd better lie down a minute , Miss Keate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of Maud and her violet sachet and what had happened afterward and I refused it with a shudder . But I told him about Claud Chivery . Told him the whole story , and watched the gray , drawn look tighten around his mouth . " Now then , " I added wearily , " you 'd better get back to bed . I thought Mrs. Brent was going to stay with you ; I would n't have left you alone so long . " He was looking at the rug with narrowed , intent eyes that did n't see it . " I thought you ought to have some rest . That 's why I did n't send for you . Alexia went away only a moment or two after you left . Miss Keate . . . " he looked at me then . " Do you have any idea who did it ? Tell me what you saw , everything . I 'm tied here . I have to depend on Pete to get around for me . And you . If I could only get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise , turned a blue-white , and I sprang forward just as  | he sat down again on the edge of the chair , clinging to the arms of it rather desperately . " Well , you ca n't , " I said . " I 've got to . I know I could do something . " " What ? " I asked . It was a pungent question . He said , " I do n't know . But something . There must be clues . There must be something the police have missed . There must be  --  well , somebody . Somebody we do n't know about . . . " It was not a nice suggestion . It conjured up a lurking , homicidal figure hidden in some forgotten room or outbuilding , waiting to pounce . Something seemed to crawl along the back of my neck , and I shot a rather nervous glance toward the door , which was closed , and into the corners of the big room where there were only empty shadows , and said rather sharply , " Who ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said finally . " It 's just that murder  --  is so unaccountable . So  --  well , so hideously erratic . You ca n't hook it up with anybody you know . " There was another little silence . I agreed with him altogether too heartily . At last I said , " If you were able to get around , what would you do ? Where would you look for what you call clues ? " " I do n't know , " he said slowly , his eyes somber and brooding , watching the fire . " I do n't know . Pete is doing what he can . But I  --  if only I could be sure that Drue is safe ! " he burst out all at once and looked at me with a sudden appeal in his glance that was boyish and direct and touched with anguish . " She 's all right , " I said quickly . " That 's one advantage of being practically under arrest . She is protected by being guarded . " His eyes clouded again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's another danger . If they arrest her  --  Miss Keate , I ca n't move . I could n't get as far as the door without collapsing .  | Do n't you see you must help me ? Be my eyes , my  --  my ears . If I could only get out of here ! " He struck the arms of the chair and gave a kind of groan . And said , " Tell me everything you saw or heard . Everything . You can trust me . " Which , for no reason at all , made me wonder if I could . Indeed , after seeing Claud Chivery as I had seen him I would have had a mental reservation about trusting my own image in the mirror . Still Craig was the one person ( besides Drue ) who could n't have killed Chivery . He might be able to get out of bed by himself and reach the chair ; he might even ? the night his father was killed  --  have walked as far as the linen room and collapsed . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't ) have waylaid Chivery at the brook ; and he could n't have hurried up that slope back of the house , along the rest of the path ( the short way I had not dared attempt ) , reached the house before me and got back to his room unobserved . Although someone could have done just that , and it did n't improve my state of mind to realize it . The path was a short cut ; there would have been time . And certainly whoever it was in that shadowy brush had gone somewhere . But I did n't know who it was nor why he was lingering there so long after Chivery must have died . I had no idea who , and telling Craig that , I almost said what as if the thing in the meadow had only horrible being and not humanity . Which in a dreadful sense was very near the truth . Well , I answered his appeal as fully as I could answer it by simply repeating , in detail , the events that had taken place since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or rather , since I had left him alone , for he 'd said that Alexia stayed in the room only a moment or two . He listened intently but asked only a few questions . And eventually I got him back to bed ; he did n't resist ; he  | seemed indeed scarcely aware of me . But he spoke of Drue , and he thought the same thing I thought . " They ca n't prove anything against her now , " he said suddenly looking up at me . They had her under guard at the time Claud was murdered . " " Thank Heaven for that , " I said , meaning it . And just then , with the ironic neatness of life 's little coincidences , Drue herself opened the door and walked in . Rather she hurried in , closing the door quickly behind her . She was breathing rapidly ; there was scarlet in her cheeks and lips and her eyes were bright . She wore her long cape with the hood over her head . She slipped the hood back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , catching gold highlights ; her hair was disheveled and she 'd been running . She came quickly toward us and Craig cried , " Drue ! For God 's sake , where have you been ? " " Is it true ? " she asked breathlessly . " About Claud Chivery ? Is it true ? I heard them in the servants ' living room . I came up the back stairs . What happened ? " I could n't answer ; I really could n't ; disappointment was like a vise on my throat , for I had so counted on her alibi . Craig said heavily , " Oh , it 's true enough . He 's been murdered ; in the meadow , north of the house , by that little brook . Drue . . . " She was very near us and Craig caught her hand , pulling her down to sit on the bed so he could look in her face . " Drue , where were you ? " " I was out , Craig . I had to get out . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a trooper . You were under guard . " " It was easy  --  he thought I was Sarah . Oh , it . does n't matter . . . " " It does matter . Tell me exactly what you did . Hurry . . . " His tone was as savage in a queer way as the tight , hard grip of his hands , and as demanding . She said ,  | " Wilkins , the other trooper , was relieved . I heard him . tell the man who took his place that there were two nurses and not to stop the other one  --  he told him which door entered your room , Sarah . And from the way he spoke I was pretty sure that the new guard got the idea we were both in our rooms . I had to get outdoors . I was stifled and sick with thinking and myself and  --  oh , I had to get out of this horrible house . It 's brought nothing but unhapp ? " She checked herself abruptly and her eyes met Craig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small flame seemed to leap between them and pause tentatively as if waiting for breath to live . Then Drue looked away . She said stiffly , " So I tricked him . It was very easy . I simply wrapped myself in my cape and pulled the hood over my head , walked out Sarah 's door and along the hall . He saw me , but he did n't see my face ? ( he may not have been here with the others ; he may not have seen either Sarah or me before ) ? but anyway whatever it was , he did n't stop me . " The little flame was gone . Drue looked at her hands . Craig 's eyes were veiled . He said , as stiffly as Drue but quickly and urgently , too . " Where did you go , Drue ? Did anyone see you ? " " I walked along the little path toward the Chivery cottage . I do n't think anyone saw me . I . . . Suddenly her voice broke and she cried , terrified and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Who is it ? What dreadful thing is happening here ? " The stiffness that had been like a wall between them broke down with that . Yet probably neither of them was aware of it . She leaned forward simply and swiftly and his arm went around her and drew her down close to him so her face was against his , and he cried softly and shakenly , " Oh , my darling , do n't be afraid . . . " And then , in the queerest little hush as if everything in the world had stopped for an instant , waiting for that  | very thing to happen , she turned her face and their lips met and clung and he held her there against him . Which was , it seemed to me , an extremely good idea . But being in my softer moments ( fortunately rare ) a little on the sentimental side , something tight got into my throat and I got up quietly and went to the window and looked out into the winter dusk . I did rather wonder after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had one good arm . And the main thing was that they had come together again and now the course of true love would run smoothly . It would be now only a question of a few words and possibly a number of kisses which do seem to have their place in life . I was sure of that . But the next instant I was n't so sure . For the door opened again and I whirled around and Alexia came quickly into the room and stopped . Drue must have heard it too , for she sat up quickly , her face radiant and her eyes shining until she saw it was Alexia standing there . Craig said , " Come in Alexia . What is it ? " Drue with a single sweeping motion so the cape fell about her like a shield rose from the bed and turned to face Alexia , her golden head high . Alexia 's lovely face looked sharper and more pointed ; her underlip was full and cruel ; her eyes gleamed softly from between those drooping eyelashes . She paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . Her soft white throat was as white as her pearls . She stood as near to Craig as was possible , as if by her very physical presence she could separate Craig and Drue . She said , " Drue , you 'd better know the truth now . Craig loves me . Not you . He belongs to me and I belong to him . It 's always been that way . You came between us once , but he did n't love you even then . " Drue 's eyes blazed . " I was his wife , " she cried . " We loved each other ! "  | Alexia 's voice , husky and vehement , rose over Drue 's . " No , he did n't love you . I knew it then . He married you , yes . We 'd had a misunderstanding ; he did it to hurt me . As I , later , married Conrad to hurt Craig . But Craig never loved you . " " I was his wife . . . . " Again Alexia laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . He asked me and his father to help him get the divorce . " Craig was as colorless as the pillow ; his eyes were closed , his mouth a straight white line . And he did n't say a word . He did n't tell Drue that Alexia lied , he did n't defend Drue , he did n't even look at either of them . I said , my hand on Drue 's arm , " Go back to your room , Drue . I 'll come to you . Hurry . " " I 'm free now , " said Alexia . " And Craig is free and ... " It was then that Alexia 's eyes fastened on Drue 's cape ; a quick look of speculation changed to one of frank and glittering triumph . She cried , " So you were n't in your room under guard when Claud was murdered ! You were out of the house ! You have no alibi ! The police are going to hear of this . . . . Craig opened his eyes then . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as cold and chill as if she were a stranger to him , " I 'm sorry . Alexia is quite right about everything . You 'd better go back to your room now . " Drue stood perfectly still for a moment , terribly still and erect , in her long blue cape with her golden-brown hair shining , and the lining of her hood a scarlet banner over her shoulders . Craig met her eyes across barriers that now , I thought , could never be dissolved . Then Drue said clearly , " I 'm going , Craig . And I 'm never coming back . "  | 15 SHE turned so swiftly toward the door that I had to run to follow her . No one was in the corridor . Drue swept along it like a queen with the folds of blue cape swirling around her , so the red lining was like her insignia of royalty . I did n't speak to her ; I took only one look at her blazing white face , her small lifted chin , the poise of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried ahead to look down to the landing with some vague idea of stopping Drue so the trooper would n't see her  --  although I could as easily , I fancy , have stopped a whirlwind . But he was gone , luckily , for Drue swept past without looking and on down the corridor and into her room . I followed her and said then , " Drue  --  Drue . . . " " Sarah , do n't ! " The little dog was there and came quickly , his tail wagging furiously ; I saw her take him into her arms as I turned away and press her white face down upon the wriggling , little brown thing . I closed the door behind me . Funny how seldom you can really face anything with anybody you love , no matter  | how hard you try . It 's the everlasting loneliness of life ; you are born alone , die alone , go up and down the winding road alone . Only in love you do ever really share , and I suppose that 's why it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Craig 's room . Alexia was sitting in a kind of sulky silence beside the bed , and Craig was lying there looking straight ahead ; neither of them spoke when I came in , although Alexia 's eyes shifted toward me , measuring me again , I thought . Wondering , planning perhaps . And after a while she got up and walked out of the room . As she went Beevens came to the door ; he still looked sick and his color was a pale blue-gray , but he said punctiliously enough : " The police are in the north meadow , sir ; I thought you had better be informed of their arrival . " Police in the north meadow . But it was at least two hours before they came to Craig 's room and brought the things they brought . It was a queer two hours which I remember in patches . Mostly we waited . Craig said nothing to me of Drue or of Alexia . Naturally , I said nothing of it to him and indeed made the few remarks I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He noticed it , for once I caught his eyes upon me in the oddest look ; it had a kind of understanding , yes , and liking , and I do n't think I imagined it . If it was liking , however , I did not reciprocate ; on the contrary , for I thought he had treated Drue abominably . Indeed , I thought a lot of - things , none of them pleasant , and looked coldly back at him and asked him what he wanted for his dinner tray . My suggestion would have been , at that moment , a sprinkling of cyanide , but it is n't really considered ethical for a nurse to poison her patient even though he richly deserves it . Which somewhat vigorous but merely fanciful line of thought brought me quickly back to unpleasant reality . Murder had actually happened in that house .  | And on a dark and silent meadow . It must have been about then , or earlier , that Peter Huber brought Maud back to the house . Alexia helped Maud to bed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have induced me to give her anything by way of a hypodermic . Maud said almost nothing ; yet she seemed in a queer way to know everything we did , her eyes were so bright and knowing in her little sallow face . It may have been shock or brandy or sedative or all three ? whatever it was , she went to bed docilely enough and then all at once to sleep . Alexia stayed with her for a while and , when she left , I think Nicky took her place . We all had that curious feeling of haste that goes along with tragedy as if there 's a great deal to do ( hurry , see to things ! ) and yet there 's really nothing you can find to do . Every so often someone would bring a bulletin from the police in the north meadow and once Peter and Nicky and Beevens went to the back door and down into the meadow until they encountered a policeman who sent them back . There were by that time quite a number of police and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streams from the cars and searchlights , and the glancing , busy gleams from small flashlights going everywhere ) like the lights of ushers in some darkened , dreadful theatre . Someone knew and told us when Chivery 's body was at last removed . A trooper again was outside Drue 's door , and this time when I attempted to enter my own room and then go to Drue , he stopped me . " Orders , Miss , " he said . And when I said , " Orders nothing ; it 's my room , " he removed my hand from the doorknob in a very muscular way and then put his hand on his revolver holster . So I had to give up ; not that I thought he was going to shoot me , I just thought I 'd wait a better chance . Beevens gave us a kind of dinner , served from the buffet in the big elaborate dining room , with its crystal  | chandeliers and stiff , green and silver brocade draperies . It was an elegant room , too big and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was having hysterics in her room and I sent her some spirits of ammonia . But before dinner Peter came to Craig 's room ; I was there and remained so I heard everything they said . Peter told him of the inquest and of our visit to Balifold where we found Maud , and when and where he had left me . " I 'm horribly sorry , Miss Ideate , " he said . " It must have been a terrible shock finding him like that . I ought to have taken you to the house . Craig , what 's your idea of this ? Why do you think he was murdered ? If it was because he knew something that was a danger to whoever it was that killed your father , then what was it ? " It was the only motive for his murder that had as yet occurred to any of us ; I suppose because it was so obvious . But I thought Craig hesitated . If so , however , it was barely perceptible . He said , " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what about these checks to Nicky ? It does look like blackmail , but there was nothing anybody could blackmail my father about . Nothing ! " Peter shrugged . " The police found the canceled checks . That 's all I know . " Craig said suddenly , " I knew about the will , of course ; Maud inherits now from Claud . " And she would inherit fifty thousand dollars ; I 'd forgotten that . I remembered Maud sitting quietly in the bar while we talked , drinking steadily . And an ugly picture presented itself in my mind : Maud in her dark cloak waiting for Claud in the meadow  --  and then afterward walking in to Balifold , trying to establish a kind of fumbling alibi , and drinking because she had to , to steady herself for the discovery . She had told me to take the short cut which was the path through the meadow and led inevitably to the discovery of the murder ; was that , again ,  | to give herself a semblance of an alibi ? Or had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path . And what of the time ? Claud had left the inquest fifteen minutes before it adjourned , which would have given him just about enough time to reach the meadow . So what of Maud ? How long actually had she been in the bar ? And how long had Chivery been dead ? Everything would depend upon that , and I did n't believe that anyone could fix the time of his death with real exactness . Craig and Peter were probably thinking very much the same thoughts for , after a longish silence Peter said suddenly , " I do n't think she did it , Craig . A woman . . . " Nicky came in just then to say there was a dinner of sorts in the dining room . A little to my surprise , Craig tackled him then and there about the checks . " What were those checks for , Nicky ? " he said . " It could n't have been an allowance . My father would n't have given you or me or anybody an allowance . " Nicky answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if Alexia asked him to . As she did for me . " A slow flush came up into Craig 's face , but his voice was quite level and steady . " Do you know Frederic Miller ? " he asked . This time Nicky did n't answer promptly ; he seemed to stop and think , cautiously . Then he said , " No . What about him ? Are there canceled checks to him , too ? " There was an eager light in his eyes that baffled me ; it was as if he really wanted an answer . But Craig shook his head and made us all go to dinner . Gertrude , the little waitress , popeyed with excitement , stayed with Craig while I ate hurriedly with the others . I was alone with Craig when the police finally came . Lieutenant Nugent and two other officers . And asked me to bring a towel from the bathroom . When I spread it out on the foot of the bed so Craig could see , they put down upon it two objects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reverse , in fact , for one was a small knife , a kitchen paring knife , quite ordinary except its blade was sharpened razor-thin and bright , and it was spotted , especially about the wooden handle , with a dark , dried substance , now turning brown . The other was a yellow string glove and it , too , was stained in thick reddish brown patches , dry now and stiff . Both had been found near Claud Chivery 's body , but not near enough for him to have used and dropped , so it did not indicate suicide . And there were no other clues , except my own white cap and some nickels , which they returned a little ceremoniously to me , Peter already having explained them . They let me stay ; in fact , they requested me to stay , for they wanted to question me , and thus I heard the whole thing . And beyond the fact that they had found no one yet who had seen Claud Chivery after he left the inquest , I knew no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about the matter of alibis . For it was developing even then that there was a troublesome lack of alibis for that hour or so during which the murder had taken place . They could n't , or at least they had n't yet been able to fix the time very definitely . They asked me about rigor mortis , I remember , and the temperature of the body when I found it and I could tell them simply nothing . I 'd had a kind of impression that he 'd been dead for a time when I 'd found him ; but had no way of giving them a really accurate answer . They asked me too , for I told them of it , about the rustle I had heard in the brush . I 'm not sure , however , that they believed the little I could tell them ; it was too tenuous , too unsubstantial a thing . Nugent told Craig again , briefly , of the inquest , except he did n't mention the checks Conrad Brent had given Nicky . Mainly they asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him last , what had Chivery said , could he suggest a motive for the murder ? " Did he know anything  --  any clue or any evidence , about your father 's death ? " " Claud did n't tell everything he knew , " said Craig obliquely . Nugent 's green eyes sharpened . " Why do you think he was killed , Brent ? " " I do n't know . But I 'd stick to the knife if I were you ? for a clue , I mean . The glove . . . " What about the glove ? " " Oh , nothing . It does n't seem to mean anything . " " You 're not being very frank , Brent . " " I ca n't do anything to help you like this . In bed . " Nugent said slowly , " I 'd better tell you that it would help if you had an alibi for this afternoon . " " I ! " Craig lifted himself abruptly on his elbow , winced and lay cautiously back again . " An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact is people are saying  --  that is  --  well , it 's like this , Brent . Everyone knows now that you and Mrs. Brent inherit practically all of your father 's money . And everyone knows that you and Mrs. Brent . . . " A slow flush was creeping up over Craig 's face ; his eyes narrowed . " Well ? Say it . " " You know as well as I do what I mean , " said Nugent . " Everyone thought you and Mrs. Brent were to be married over a year ago ; then you married the little nurse and Alexia Senour married your father . Now they 're saying .. . " Listen ! I did n't kill my father ! Get that into your head ! I did n't kill Claud , either , " said Craig bleakly . " I 've no alibi for this afternoon , unless you consider it an alibi not to be able to walk without getting dizzy . " Nugent leaned forward . " Are you sure of that , Brent ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face . " My God , do you think I 'd stay here if I could help it ? " he cried angrily . " Do n't you think I 'd get out and do something ! Do n't you . . . " What would you do ? " broke in Nugent softly . Craig stopped abruptly . " I do n't know , " he said wearily , after a moment . " I do n't know . " I said , merely in the line of duty and not to defend Craig , " He could n't have murdered Dr. Chivery . He could n't have walked that far and back again . I 'm sure of that , Lieutenant . " Nugent 's gray-green gaze plunged at me . " Are you , Miss Keate ? " " Yes . And as to that , Mr. Brent had an alibi the night Mr. Brent  --  that is , his father  --  died . I was with him . " I know , " said Nugent without any expression at all in his face . " Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And there really is no alibi in the case of murder by poison . " Craig made a quick motion forward as if to expostulate , and I said hurriedly , " I ca n't let you question my patient very long , Lieutenant . " And put my hand on Craig 's wrist . Not , again , to defend Craig but merely because it was my obvious duty . His pulse seemed steady enough , however . And Nugent said , " All right . Just a few more questions . The night your father died , Brent , you were found in the linen room . How did you get there ? " " I told you everything I knew about that . " " You said someone struck you . Who ? " " I do n't know . I 've told you . I did n't know anyone was near me . " " You say you were in the hall , starting downstairs , your back to the corridor . How did you get into the linen room where your wife  --  I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know . That 's the truth . You 've no case against me . Nugent looked at him slowly . " I 'm not saying I have , " he said . " But where there 's murder , there 's motive . And everybody knows that you and Mrs. Brent . . " Ca n't we leave Mrs. Brent out of this ? " " Not very well , " said Nugent . But after a moment 's thoughtful silence he said no more of Alexia and went on instead to Conrad Brent 's will , asking Craig if he knew its main provisions . Craig said he did . " My father told me . " " How did he make his money ? " Craig glanced at the Lieutenant with a little surprise . " It 's no secret . He inherited from his father , quite a lot ; I do n't know how much . He invested it  --  oh , a long time ago . Before I was born . Anyway , everything he touched prospered . In the summer of 1929 he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he 's done very little buying or selling of stocks . " " He was a very rich man . " " Yes , " said Craig , " he was . That is , it was n't anything fantastic . But more than enough . " Nugent , hard and sinuous as a whip in his trim uniform , leaned over the railing at the foot of the bed . Lights touched his narrow high cheekbones and reflected in small points in his gray green eyes . " Brent , there was a queer codicil to your father 's will . I mean , he 'd lived in America all his life . . . " " Oh , that , " said Craig abruptly . " You mean he wanted to be buried in Germany . At Stuttgart . Yes , I know . It was an odd notion of his . When it struck him years ago , he had it written into his will ; then , after his recent marriage , when his new will was written I suppose that was just carried over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " Why did he want it , in the first place ? "  | " You 'd have to understand and know my father to understand that , " said Craig slowly . " I 'll try to explain . He once had a kind of hobby for family ; he dug into his genealogy , oh , away back when . Unearthed a single direct line , and clung to it . Got hold of the coat of arms , all possible records and history , everything . He was of German descent ; although I think his father came to America and made his fortune sometime before the Civil War . My father had time on his hands ; the study of genealogy interested him . " " A hobby , " said Nugent . " I see . He did n't take it too seriously , did he ? " " What do you mean ? " " Well , did he consider going back to Germany to live , for instance ? " said Nugent . " Good God , no , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that was all . He thought a lot about pure Nordic blood . . . " " Approved of some of Hitler 's ideas , in other words ? " " No ! It was only at the beginning of the Hitler regime that he was rather taken with some of the ideology it claimed  --  resurrecting the old Teutonic family life , improving the race , keeping family blood pure , that kind of thing . But he got over that right away . There was nobody more loyal to America than my father . I 'm sure of that . He much regretted that he 'd been even briefly taken in by anything Hitler claimed . " " I see , " said Nugent . " Forgive me , Brent , but he did disapprove of your marriage , did n't he ? " " He thought we had n't known each other long enough . That was all . " " Oh , " said Nugent . " I had an idea that you had rather quarreled with him about your marriage . I mean when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marry into his family . " " That , " said Craig dangerously , " is enough of that .  | As a matter of fact , Miss Cable was too good for me and the Brent family . If that is all , Lieutenant . . . " No , it is n't , " said Nugent . " It 's this way , Brent . Soper thinks the girl  --  your former wife  --  did it . I 'm not sure . Until something clinching and material turns up I 'd like to hold off an arrest . And I 've tried to give her a fair break . But she 's not telling everything she knows . " " Well ? " said Craig , still with a dangerous look in his face . " For one thing , she disclaims having taken the missing box of medicine . Yet her fingerprints were on the drawer of the desk where the medicine was kept ; they were on the wooden handle and the panel across the front . She would n't explain how they got there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward my white oxfords ; yet I 'd been afraid of it . Craig said evenly , " That does n't prove anything . " " And she got past my man late this afternoon and went outdoors . He . . . " Nugent stopped there and left us to conjecture what had happened to the trooper on guard in consequence . " It wo n't happen again , " he said briefly . " But she was out of the house at the time Chivery was killed . " " A woman could n't have killed him ! Like that , " said Craig . " Mrs. Brent told us Drue Cable had been out of the house , " said Nugent slowly , and looked at the ugly things that still lay there on the towel  --  the bright , sharp paring knife , the yellow glove . And abruptly then , after a few more questions about Claud Chivery , they went away . As they left , Craig asked a question . " Oh , by the way , Nugent ... " The Lieutenant turned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find only one glove ? " For an instant something very deep and intent stirred  | again away back in Lieutenant Nugent 's green gray eyes . " Only one . See you in the morning , Brent . The District Attorney may be here then , too . I 'm leaving a man in the house tonight . " They went away then , rolling up the towel and taking it and the things inside it along with them . Craig lay in silence , his eyes closed , after their departure . And I ca n't say that I felt exactly chipper and talkative myself . And presently Beevens came ; he 'd stay with Mr. Brent he said , while I got some rest . " And the Lieutenant spoke to the trooper on guard in the hall . I heard him , Miss . He 's to let you enter and leave your room whenever you wish to . " " They 're still holding Miss Cable , then , " said Craig . " Yes , sir . I 'm afraid they are . Is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was n't and went away quickly ; there were things I had to do , for somehow , now , everything was different . It was an ugly difference too , something in the air , in the stillness of the house , in the shadows in the corners and around the stairwell . In our meeting eyes . There was no possibility of evasion this time ; no way to deceive ourselves , no glossing of the grim and terrifying truth . Murder had been in that house , murder on the black and silent meadow . A thing that struck swiftly , out of nowhere and might strike again as swiftly , as silently . An opened door , with the room unlighted beyond it , was a threat . Well , I hurried along the corridor . The trooper , the same one who had stopped me earlier in the evening , let me enter my room , this time without a word . But I did n't go straight on to Drue 's room , for the first thing I had to do was write a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had done any harm or ob  | structed their inquiry in the least by hiding the hypodermic syringe . But I also felt a responsibility about it , to say nothing of the empty medicine box . So light in my hand when I weighed it and looked at it , so heavy on my heart . Perhaps now that Claud Chivery was dead Drue would tell me what she knew of it . But just now I had to write my letter . Since the shooting episode , not unnaturally perhaps , I had felt a remarkably unpleasant sense of personal danger . This was now very much stronger . I had seen Claud Chivery with his throat cut , huddled like an empty sack . The only motive for murder so far attributable was that he 'd known something that was a danger to the murderer of Conrad Brent , or to whoever it was that shot Craig . And I , accursed with the Keate nose and a mentality that would have startled and delighted any psychiatrist , was simply reeking with clues . I had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it was impossible to avoid the conclusion that if I did n't end as Claud Chivery had ended I 'd be lucky . True , I was none the wiser for any of my clues , if clues they were , for I did n't know who had murdered Conrad or Claud . But still there they were , and suppose something happened to me . Not that I intended to let anything happen to me ; but I did want a clear  --  or fairly clear conscience . Just in case . And it was equally conceivable that the little I knew might later , in some way , clear Drue or another innocent person , rather than convict anyone . So I wrote it quickly , a bare statement of facts about the hypodermic  --  not the medicine box , for that was still Drue 's secret  --  put it in an envelope , and , as I did n't know what else to do with it , I pinned that too to the under side of my uniform , just below a pocket so it did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to that , mine is not  | exactly the kind of figure which reveals an extra bulge or two . Even then , however , I did n't go to Drue . I had nothing to tell her , nothing at all to offer that would give her support , except my affection for her and she knew she had that . Besides , I 'd have had to ask her again about the medicine box . But I was beginning to be thankful for the trooper on guard at her door . Whatever the intention was , the result must be a degree of safety for Drue . After that twilight moment or two down in the meadow , a queer and horrible unsafeness was everywhere in that house , among the shadows of driveway and garden , across the stretch of lawns , around every corner . Even the encircling , shadowy hills seemed to know it and wait and watch . I went first in search of Anna 's room . The narrow hall that crossed the main corridor near the stairway led to the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance to some rather steep back stairs , turned again and brought up in a wing that was obviously the servants ' wing . I walked along , passing one or two open doors beyond which Anna obviously was not , and came to a closed one . And just as I knocked someone inside the room spoke . It was a murmur , further muffled by my knock , but it sounded masculine . And it stopped abruptly at the sound of my knuckles on the door . But it was Anna 's room ; for , after a longish pause , I knocked again and then Anna said quaveringly , " Is that you , Gertrude ? I  --  I 'm asleep . " " It 's Miss Ideate . I want to see you . " There was another sudden silence on the other side of the door . This time however there was a quality of consternation about it . Anna was not the type for tender dalliance ; I did n't even think of that . But I did n't im-  | imagine the consternation either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said suddenly , almost at the keyhole , breathlessly , " I  --  I 'm all right now . I 'm not upset any more . " And when I insisted , she just kept repeating it , " I 'm all right . Thank you , Nurse . There 's nothing wrong ? nothing wrong . . . " with her voice growing thinner and more frightened at every word . It was exactly as if whoever was there with her , and had stopped talking when I knocked , was standing beside her holding a club over her head . But it was n't really till sometime the next morning that they found the other yellow glove , bloodstained and stiff , hidden under the mattress in Anna 's room . And by that time it was impossible to question her .  | 16 WELL , luckily in a way , I did n't yet know about that . And I could n't break down the door to Anna 's room and I could n't see through hard pine . I said , " Open the door , Anna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get some medicine for you . " " Thank you , Miss Keate . No , I 'm all right now . " There was another slight pause , and she added , " I do n't need medicine , thank you . I do n't need anything . " So in the end I was obliged to retire to the end of the hall , loudly , and return on tiptoe to the open door of a room opposite Anna 's . But after five minutes no one had emerged and there was no further sound of a ( possibly ) masculine voice from behind the closed door on which my eyes were glued . I was eyeing the keyhole thoughtfully and , indeed , had tiptoed nearer and was bending over ( merely to see if a key was in it ; as there was ) when I heard footsteps behind me and straightened and whirled around and it was Beevens . Who said " Ah " and coughed , giving me a chance to pull myself together . Not that I needed it ; I said " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation were my everyday and normal activity .  | " Dear , dear , dear , " observed Beevens , and again coughed and choked and choked and coughed so wildly that I saw that he was agitatedly concerned with something else and possibly had scarcely noted my posture and pursuit . His eyes were bulging and his throat palpitated like a fish 's gills , quite noticeably , above the little white wings of his collar . Craig wanted me  --  at once , quickly , he said . Not even by a look did he question my presence just where I was and where I had no business to be . There was silence in Anna 's room . So I followed Beevens back to Craig 's room and Craig was waiting impatiently , watching the door , harassing the folds of blanket and coverlet across him with nervous fingers . " There you are , " he said . " Come in . That 's all , Beevens . Shut the door . " Beevens hesitated . " If you please , Mr. Craig . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked Craig 's impatience . " What is it , Beevens ? " The butler cleared his throat and came nearer the bed . " Two things , really , Mr. Craig . I 've been in some doubt , but I  --  if you feel quite able . . . " He glanced anxiously at me as if for my permission and Craig said quickly , " Yes , of course . What is it ? " Beevens swallowed . " A large blue vase has disappeared from the hall . " Craig frowned , his eyes perplexed . Beevens said , " No one knows anything about its disappearance . " After a moment Craig said : " What else ? " The other item Beevens had to relay was more serious . " It 's a question of alibis , sir , " he said . " Mr. Nicky told the police he spent two hours this afternoon in the morning room ; he said he did n't leave the room at all  --  during the time Dr. Chivery was killed . And Gertrude  --  the housemaid  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . "  | " But he did leave , sir . I saw him . " Craig sat up abruptly . " You saw him ! When ? Where ? " Beevens looked quickly over his shoulder and lowered his voice still further . " He went out the side door , sir . Walking toward the garage . I thought nothing of it , naturally . Until the police . . . " " What time ? " Beevens swallowed hard . " Not more than half an hour before the nurse found Dr. Chivery and reached us with the news . Scarcely half an hour , as a matter of fact . " There was another silence . Beevens ' intelligent blue eyes watched Craig and reserved conclusions . And I thought , was it Nicky then in the meadow ? But Claud Chivery had been dead for some time when I found him . Then why , if it was Nicky , had he lingered ? Or had he returned for something ? The glove ? The knife ? Craig said , " Are you sure it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I saw him walking toward the garage and thus toward the meadow . Besides , I could n't mistake his checked coat ; I was looking out the pantry window . But I did n't see him return . I was busy then in the dining room ; he could have returned by the door just opposite the back stairs , gone upstairs and then down again by the front stairs . There 's no doubt he had returned by the time the nurse reached the house . " He paused . " Shall I tell the police , sir ? I heard them question him and he definitely did not admit his absence from the house . " " Yes . . . " said Craig , and changed his mind . " No ! No  --  I 'll tell them , . Is that all , Beevens ? " It was apparently all . But after Beevens had gone , closing the door carefully behind him , Craig lay for a moment in thoughtful silence ; he looked perplexed  --  but there was something else in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barest glimpse of some new idea . Well , Nicky had been one of my choice suspects all along . And  | there 's no doubt there was something queerly feral and inhuman in his very grace and lightness , as if behind his pointed face a graceful jungle beast might well inhabit . Craig finally shook his head in an impatient and perplexed way and looked at me . " See here , Miss Keate , I 've been thinking . You 're fond of Drue , are n't you ? Never mind answering , I 've got eyes . Well , then . . . " He paused , his gaze plunging deeply into my own as if to test some quality within me . " Look here , " he said . " I 've got to trust you . You 're pretty discreet  --  are n't you ? " I lifted my eyebrows and nose and he said , " Oh , yes , I know , but this is murder . . . " My dear young man , " I said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The exigencies of my career have not failed to include a brush or two with the law . " " Oh , " he said and looked at me speculatively for a moment . I did not see fit to explain , however , for one reason , the memories induced were a little unnerving , particularly just then and in that murder-ridden house . And for another reason , what is past is past and usually a good thing . So I merely waited in silence and presently he frowned and said , " I know . But it 's not me or you that 's in danger . It 's Drue . " And at that , though it was not a new thought , I sat down on my patient 's bed for the first time in my professional career . " What do you mean ? What new . . . ? " " Oh , it is n't new ! I guess I 'll have to tell you . You 're her friend . It  --  well , what I want you to undertake , Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digested that for an instant . " Exactly what do you want me to steal ? " His eyes were very intent ; he put his hand tight and hard on mine as if to compel my understanding . " This is important , Miss Keate . It means everything to her . If . they get hold of material evidence against her . . . " " All right . Tell me quickly . "  | He was still reluctant to share the thing with me . " If I could only do it myself . I 'll be up tomorrow . I must be . I tried to get up just now , while you were out of the room . Beevens helped me . It was no good . " " Do n't be a fool , " I said hotly . " Do you want to work up a fancy temperature ? " " I 've got about as much strength as a kitten , " he said angrily . " It 's a hypodermic , Miss Keate . It 's Drue 's hypodermic syringe . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakly . " You see , Alexia 's got it . She is sure it belongs to Drue . She found it somewhere . . . " Never mind  --  I know . . . " You know ! " " I put it there . In the fern . " He started abruptly upright , clasped his free hand quickly over his wounded shoulder and cried , " You , for God 's sake ! Why ? " " Never mind that either ; I thought I was doing the right thing . Where does Alexia keep it ? " But he lay there staring at me . " She did n't tell me you had put it there , " he said , and muttered something which sounded more or less profane . Then he said more sensibly , " Do you know what happened ? Why did you hide it ? Did Drue really give my father the hypodermic ? " " Yes , she did , " I said , sighing and very cross . " But she did n't kill him with it . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody but Maud is downstairs now . If I 'm to search Alexia 's room I 'd better do it quickly . " He was still anxious and frowning but agreed with me at once . " Right . You 'll have to hurry . Look in her dressing room , and in the cupboard in her bathroom . Then also , there is a kind of cupboard built into the wall beside her bed . You 'll see . She says she puts jewelry and stuff in there when she does n't want to bother to put them in the safe . Look there . Look . . . " He moved rest-  | lessly and impatiently . " If only I could go ! I suppose there 's not a chance of your finding it . There 's no telling where she 's put it and it 's so little . . . I was on my feet . " When did Alexia tell you this ? How long have you known ? " A subtle change came over his face ; his mouth tightened a little , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked very remote and uncommunicative . " Not very long , " he said . " She would n't tell me where she kept it . You 'd better go . It 's the second door to the left across the hall . I hate to ask you to do this ... " I did n't tell him I only wanted the chance . I went at once to Alexia 's room and the trooper was the only person in the long , wide corridor and he was away down near Drue 's room with his back turned toward me and thus did n't see me . But I did n't find the hypodermic . I found Alexia 's room with no trouble and I searched it , and her tiny , luxurious dressing room as quickly as I could ; and , while I do n't happen to have the underworld training really requisite for such a task , still I do have a native aptitude for thoroughness . Indeed , the cool way I went through that glittering little dressing room confirmed a kind of impression I 've had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd chosen the wrong era and sex to be born in and of . I mean , well , I would n't have been a successful courtesan but , after all , there were pirates . I felt it even more so when , giving up the dressing room and going back into the beige and rose bedroom with its deep rugs and great leopard-skin hassocks and huge sheets of mirrors , I went directly to the little bookshelf and found the cupboard . And found not the syringe but something else and that was a little cluster of checks made out to Frederic Miller . There were three of them , for five thousand dollars each , signed by Conrad Brent , dated in July , September  | and October of 1938 . They were canceled and endorsed " Frederic Miller " in an ornate and curly handwriting and pinned together with a little steel pin . They were lying flat , under a soft suede case , the kind you use for jewelry when traveling . The multitudinous nurses reflected in the mirrors ( all in white , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red hair and white caps which were in every case a little crooked ) gave a simultaneous and rather theatrical start . There was no shadowy pirate forebear standing behind each one of them , but there might well have been for , after only a few seconds meditation , I took the checks , adding them to my already substantial little hoard of dues . I 'd have to tell Nugent . But I 'd tell Craig first . I did n't go then into the intricacies of explaining to Nugent how I 'd got hold of the checks . And perhaps five minutes later I had to give up ; it seemed more like an hour what with watching the door with one eye , looking for the syringe with the other , and listening with both ears in case someone came  --  which sounds involved but was n't and had no really permanent effect upon my eyesight . When I heard voices somewhere in the distance I thought I 'd better give up . I ducked out of Alexia 's room and into my patient 's room as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by Peter Huber . Craig was watching for me eagerly but still looked a little startled at my possibly precipitous entrance . " Somebody chasing you ? " he said . I straightened my cap and caught my breath and he got up on his elbow . " Did you find it ? " " No . " I hated the disappointment in his eyes , the tenseness of sharpened anxiety , almost as much as the admission itself . He lay back against the pillows . " Oh . All right , Miss  | Keate . Do n't look like that . You did your best . She 's given it to the police , then . She said she would . She hates Drue . It 's because of ' . . . " He stopped there , abruptly , his face a kind of mixture of anger and discomfort and , queerly , sadness . There was no embarrassment about it and no fatuous or flattered look . I said crisply , " Because of you , I suppose . She makes it clear enough . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , but there was still a sad , altogether mature and grave look in his face . " I hurt Alexia 's pride one time . I did n't realize I was doing it ; I was in love with Drue , you see . I was so in love that " ? he paused and then said , simply ? " so in love that there was n't any other woman in the world . There was n't anything but I ) rue . " He stopped again and then went on , " Alexia just did n't exist for me . Nothing did really . " There was another silence ; I was wishing Drue could hear him and resolving to tell her . I also realized that this was the time to put in a word or two with a view to clearing the situation between them . That is , while I am neither meddlesome or sentimental , it did seem to me that interference was practically invited at that point . However , just as I was preparing to come out with something really clinching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different tone , " I tried to humor Alexia . She has the whip-hand . And my father loved her ? he did , you know . She married him and he loved her . " " Do n't get excited , " I said , automatically rearranging the covers he had twisted around . " You 'll get a fever .... " " Oh , for God 's sake shut up , " shouted Craig suddenly , explosively , and gave a flounce which sent the eiderdown on the floor . " Do n't talk to me like that , young man ! " I picked up the eiderdown and put it over the foot of the bed . " I 've got to think ! I 've got to do something . . . .  | " Well , it does n't help to shout . " He glared at me and I glared back at him . My fingers itched to come into smart contact with his ears , but such a gesture seemed rather to exceed my nursing duties . And then just as we were staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening , he grinned . The : anger went out of his eyes and an odd , amused and , which was really remarkable , a rather affectionate look came into them . It really was that , and I could n't help seeing it . He said : " I 'm sorry , Miss Keate . It 's only that it makes me savage , being helpless like this . " " You 're lucky you 're not dead , " I said crisply . The shadow came back into his face . " Yes , but it 's Drue that 's in danger . If she gave him digitalis . . . " She tried to save his life . She did n't give him enough digitalis to kill him . Unfortunately , though , " I added grimly , " there 's no way to prove that . That 's our whole trouble . Are you sure Alexia gave the syringe to the police ? Perhaps it was only a threat . " " I think she meant it . I was a fool . She knows I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . I was afraid of what she would do to Drue . Sounds queer to say you 're  --  afraid of anybody . But Alexia 's not like other people . " He paused and then thoughtfully , quietly , as if he were explaining something to himself as well as to me , talked of Alexia . " We 've known each other since we were children , you know : Nicky and Alexia and I. They used to come here for summers when their mother was alive ; then she married again and went abroad to live . Nicky and Alexia were pushed around anyhow , schools in France and Italy , camps in Switzerland , hotels everywhere . After their mother died they were shipped back here . They had n't really much of a chance and never enough money . My father always liked Alexia . " " Your father was in love with her . " " Yes , later . Perhaps all along without realizing it . At  | any rate Alexia married him . She 's ruthless in a queer way , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it does n't touch her it does n't exist . She  --  I ca n't describe it exactly . She 's the same with animals . It 's like a kind of blindness . " " She could murder anybody . " He looked up at me quickly . There was a short silence . Then he said slowly , " Not unless she was so angry that she did n't stop to think . But that 's why I 'm afraid of what she might do to Drue . " There was a sincerity in his voice that did n't give my spirits what you could call a lift . But I did decide ( provisionally ) that Craig Brent had not murdered his father . And I must talk to Drue and among other things tell her that . Perhaps , then , she would explain about the medicine-box  --  that is , if her determined silence regarding it really was , as I thought it was , to protect Craig . Which meant obviously that at some time it had been in Craig 's possession and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full circle again and in spite of myself I wondered whether Craig 's continued and repeated statements of regret at not being able to get around were as sincere and frantically frustrated as he made them sound ! I was thinking that ( and it was definitely not a happy thought ) when he said abruptly , " That shooting in the meadow night before last ; you remember ? " " How could I forget ? " I demanded with some earnestness . " Nugent thinks it was a kind of spur-of-the-moment attack on you . " " Just an idle impulse , no doubt , " I said , bitterly . " Well , I did n't like it just the same . " " Anna was sure it was only a hunter . Hunting in the meadow is not uncommon , you know . " " Besides being a fine alibi ! " " Yes . There 's that too . But are you sure he shot at you ? "  | " I 'm sure two bullets whizzed over my head . Of course , he may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been just a little prankster , bent on having his fun and giving us both a scare . " I said it sarcastically , but he looked perfectly sober . " Perhaps , " he said , and added , " Anna 's honest and loyal . " And before I could remark upon the curious way Anna , terrified , with a mysteriously black eye , kept obtruding herself at every turn ( to say nothing of a masculine voice , hurriedly hushing , drifting out of the keyhole ) , he went on , " I suppose there 'll be traces of digitalis in the little  --  what do you call it , barrel ? ? of the hypodermic ? " " Yes . Unless it 's been cleaned . Did Alexia see me put it there ? " " She did n't say . " I thought back rapidly to the hurried moments following Conrad 's death . " She was walking up and down in the library , just behind the big desk . She must have seen me put it under the fern . Beevens was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I turned I saw no one . But ? yes , the stair landing is visible from the library ; she must have moved out of sight just as I turned . Then I suppose she took it  --  later , on her way upstairs , immediately after she left the library . " " Miss Keate , who telephoned for the police ? " It was of course a pointed and significant question and had been from the first . But it was still without an answer . " I do n't know . I simply do n't know . " " If we could find out who did that and why . If I could do anything  --  anything . . . " I looked at hirn , decided to meddle , took a long breath and said , " Look here , you still love your wife . " " She 's not my wife . You forget that . " " Fiddlesticks . There 's no law against remarrying . If Nicky ... "  | " What about Nicky ? " The question was like a pounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You 'd hate . . . " he stopped . " Listen , Miss Keate , there 's something you do n't know . That 's why she left me . Because of Nicky . "  | 17 THE breath simply went out of my lungs , so I could n't say a word . " Oh , yes , it 's perfectly true , " said Craig quietly . " She loved him . There 's no other explanation for it . I did n't blame her . How could I ? It 's nothing you can help or do anything about . Love , I mean . I knew Drue . No cheap emotion would have made her do it . It was the real thing . " " But Nicky ! " I gasped , incredulous . He smiled a little . " That 's another thing about love ; you do n't choose . If you 're in love and it 's the wrong man or the wrong woman , still you ca n't help it . " " N-nonsense , " I exclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help it ! You can nip it in the bud ! You can ? why , that 's a very immoral statement ! " He shook his head a little . " They went away together . Only a little while after she became my wife . It 's been Nicky all along ; only he would n't marry her because of the money . My father was grateful enough to Nicky for breaking up our  --  the marriage . . . " He said it swiftly . " He paid Nicky regularly for that , all this time . That is ,  | I 'm sure , the explanation of those checks to Nicky . But my father would n't have given Nicky a cent if he 'd married Drue . " I wanted to shake him . Stupid , blind young idiot . I said , " She is in love with you . She always has been . She .. . He interrupted sharply , " There 's no use talking of that , Miss Keate . She went away with Nicky while I was in Washington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a lawyer . She never tried to communicate with me . " " She wrote to you . " " No . " " Yes , she did . She told me . " " She . . . " He looked slowly at me . " I never got it . Are you sure ? My father would n't have . . . " Your father would have tampered with St. Peter 's mail if he wanted to . But it 's too late now . What happened then ? " " But I ca n't believe . . . Well , then I went into training . She had gone with Nicky ; she did n't even just go away and then meet him later ; she actually left the house with him . My father told me . She did n't write to me .... " " Look here , " I said in exasperation . " Five minutes talk with Drue would clear up everything . " " No , " he said stubbornly . " All that 's in the past and done with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted a divorce . " " No , it was Drue . . . . " " Nonsense . She only wanted it so you could get into training . " " She . . . " He stopped and gave me a long look and then said very slowly , " Exactly what do you mean ? " " Are you trying to make me believe that you know nothing about that ? "  | " I have n't the faintest idea as to what you 're driving at . What do you mean ? " " Now , see here , " I began incredulously and then , at the look in his face , gave up . " Oh , all right . Drue said that your father explained to her why you wanted her to ask for a divorce . " " But I did n't . . . " Again he checked himself and said , " For God 's sake go on . Why would I want a divorce ? " " To get into the training school , of course . Your father told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They would n't at the time . But I could have gone to another . . . " He broke off again to question me . " He told her that ? " " Yes . He said it was the thing above everything else that you wanted to do  --  or at least he succeeded in making her think that . He convinced her so thoroughly that she consented to ask for a divorce  --  believing that you did n't want to ask her for it yourself . And that once the training was over you would come back and marry her again . He told her , " I added , quoting , " that it would be merely a long engagement . " Craig 's eyes were very intent and very bright  --  and a little sad . He looked at me for a long moment or two as if to test the things I had said and measure them in his mind against what he had formerly believed . " So , " he said at last , " he did that . And then I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Obviously , " I said , seeing that he was reluctant to say it . " Obviously your father got the letters . And Drue being the kind of girl she is , I do n't think she would write very many letters without a reply . " " No , " he said slowly , staring at the mound his feet made under the eiderdown . " No , she would n't write very many times without a reply . " I said , " I 'm going to get Drue . I think I can manage  | somehow to get her past the guard ; perhaps I ca n't but . . . ' " Wait a minute , " he said sharply . And stared at his feet , frowning . And finally said , " No . " " But . . . " " No , do n't . You 've forgotten Nicky . " " Nicky ! " I cried . " Drue 's not in love with Nicky and never was ! You 're as stubborn as your father ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't help being the way he was . " Nor you the way you are , I thought in furious exasperation . " Oh , Good Heavens ! Ca n't you see she 's in love with you ? That 's why she came here . She wanted to find out what had happened , why you demanded a divorce without even seeing her again . They drove her away  --  your father and Alexia and Nicky . Your father planned the whole thing . He paid Nicky for whatever he did to help . " He stopped my headlong flight into conjecture  --  yet , knowing Drue , knowing something of Nicky , it seemed to me reasonable conjecture . But he said , " So she went away with Nicky . Willingly . " " But she  --  there 's an explanation for it . Give her a chance and give yourself one . That  --  why , that 's why your father meant to send her away . The night he died . She told him , I heard her ; she warned him . She said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorce . " There was a little silence , then he shook his head slowly and deliberately . And I lost my temper . " All right , " I snapped , " think as you please . It 's your loss . You can fix your own pillows and dress your own wound , too , because I 'm through with you . I wash my hands of you . If you 'd even tell the truth about the things you know it would help . You know who shot you , do n't you ? And you knew there 'd be another murder . And you know about  | the yellow glove  --  the glove that they found beside Claud Chivery . And I think you know why he was killed . " " If I knew anything I could tell the police I would do so . But you see , Miss Keate , that 's the trouble . If I tell who shot me , it 'll make it that much the worse for Drue . It was n't the same person . The person that shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed my father  --  or Claud Chivery . If I tell the police that they 'll say she murdered my father . " After a moment I said heavily , " Was it your father , then ? Why ? Was it a quarrel over  --  well , was he jealous of Alexia ? " I could n't read his eyes . He drew up his knees and clasped his unbandaged arm around them . " Forget that , Miss Keate , " he said decisively . " The thing for us to do is to insist upon Drue 's alibi for that night when I was shot . " " You said There 'll be murder done . ' You said that the afternoon before your father was murdered . " " I remember , vaguely . I was n't sure  --  I 'm not sure now exactly why I was shot . But I had a vague notion that I ought to tell Claud that it was an attempt at murder . " " But that is n't what you said . You did n't say There was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as you put it . You said There 'll be murder . . " " I know . You see , I had sense enough to know that since the first attempt had failed another attempt might be made . " " Do you mean you wanted protection ? " " In a sense . Yes . I wanted someone to know . I was n't clear in my head . I only knew there was danger  --  everywhere . " " Why ? " I demanded . " Because , " he said . Which was not exactly illuminating . " Why Claud ? " I persisted , getting nowhere fast .  | " Because Claud was Claud . He was n't much in the way of force . Yet he  --  he knew all about us ; he smoothed things over , he could always manage my father ; he was in the queerest way devoted to him . I think , " said Craig slowly , " it was partly because of Maud ; she thought there was no one like my father . In many ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gave in to her about everything but money . Maud 's a little overfond of money and would have been a sucker for get-rich-quick schemes if Claud had let her ! " " Oh , she would n't have murdered Claud on account of the will , " said Craig quickly . " They did have a quarrel lately about money . Claud told me . But it was only about some money they had invested , twenty thousand or so ; Maud wanted the cash in order to make another investment . Claud did n't know  --  or at least did n't tell me what it was . " " I suppose , " I said on a wave of astuteness , " that Claud knew who shot you . And got rid of the bullet so it could n't be traced . " ( As he would have done , I thought , for Conrad , to keep a family secret . ) But Craig 's face was instantly blank and hard . " Do you ? " he said flatly . So I got nowhere with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my watch , something rustled in my pocket and I remembered what , actually , I 'd forgotten , the Frederic Miller checks . I gave them to him at once . " They were in Alexia 's room , in the cupboard ... " He snatched them out of my hand ; he looked at them and examined them and questioned me and then lay for a long time staring at the sprawling gilt figures on the dark wall paper , a queer look in his eyes , his fingers tapping the checks , an expression in his face that I could n't read . I tried to question him . " Do you know who Frederic Miller is , is that it ? " " No  --  no  --  that is , perhaps I do . I 'm not sure . Let me think . . . . "  | But he did n't want to think any longer , for almost at once he turned quickly to me , excitedly . " Look here , Miss Keate . Will I be able to get out tomorrow ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed and walk around the room  --  that 's about all , " I said slowly . " You 've done extremely well , as a matter of fact . " " Can I get to the Chivery cottage ? " " No . " " But I 've got to . " " All right . You 're free , white and twenty-one . Go ahead and kill yourself . " " I 'll keep these checks . " " Are you going to give them to the police ? " He hesitated . " I do n't know . I 've got to think . If they arrest Drue , I 'll do anything  --  everything . . . . I gave as jeering and mean a laugh as I could contrive ? and succeeded so well that it startled even me . Craig jumped and stared at me . I said , " Anything , yes ! Except tell her you still love her . And use your common sense about Nicky . " " If she loves me , " he said slowly , " that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I cried again . Practically with eagerness . " I 'll get rid of the trooper on guard  --  I do n't know how . But I 'll get her . . . " " No , " he said again and firmly . " You 'll bring Alexia here . Now . If you please , Miss Keate . " " Alexia ! What on earth for ? " The queer look of speculation was in his face again . He said quite coolly , looking remarkably like his father in his more unpleasant moments , " Because I 'm going to ask her to marry me . " " Marry Alexia ! But , good heavens . . . " I broke off . " If you think you 'll keep her from giving them the hypodermic that way . . . " Please go , Miss Keate . " " But I . . .  | He lifted himself on his elbow ; his eyes flashed and his chin and nose seemed to grow hawkier , if you understand me . He snapped crisply as a drill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her here ! " Well , I did it . I 've never met a man yet that could make me change my mind ; I obeyed him only because ? oh , because I did . I was furious , too . I caught a glimpse of myself marching back out of the room with my red hair flaming and two bright spots of anger on my cheeks . But I got Alexia . She was in her room , undressing , and I had to watch her select a diaphanous creamy lace garment that set my teeth on edge and not because it courted pneumonia and , as to that , every possible rheumatic ailment . I only hoped , following her lovely figure and noting how seductively the creamy soft folds of lace and chiffon melted into it , that she would be thus attacked and succumb quickly . In fact , before she reached Craig 's room . It was a wild hope . The trooper down at the end of the hall saw us and even at that distance I could see him snap to interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Craig 's room and she swept straight to the bed and Craig said , " Alexia , did you give the police the hypodermic ? " " Why , I . . . " She settled down on the bed , sitting very close to him , her short , dark hair cloudlike and beautiful about her pointed , delicate face . " Yes , I did , Craig , " she said softly . She shot a glance toward me . " I thought I ought to . It was my duty . I gave it to Nugent tonight . He 's taking it to be fingerprinted . And to have the sediment inside the barrel tested for digitalis . I 'm sorry , Craig , but I had to do it . " " Yes , " said Craig slowly . " I suppose you had to . Well , you 've done it now . Alexia , there 's something I want to ask you . " " Yes , Craig . "  | " Will you marry me ? " I shut my teeth so hard that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned out , after I 'd said it , to be highly profane . Alexia did n't hear it , not that I would have been anything but pleased if she had , but she was leaning over toward Craig as if she could n't believe her ears . " Why , Craig ! " she cried . " Will you ? " he demanded , his eyes holding her own intently and his profile exactly at that moment like a belligerent young hawk 's . " Why , I  --  oh , Craig darling . " She hesitated . Then she seemed to get a kind of hold on herself and leaned over nearer him , lace and chiffon and all . " Oh , my darling , " she breathed . " At last . . . " He pushed her away , rather abruptly , so I hoped she 'd fall off the bed , but she did n't . He said , " I do n't mean just sometime in the future . I mean now . Right away . Tomorrow . " " But your father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It does n't matter . They 'll not know . I can fix everything . Will you , Alexia ? " Which was just exactly more than I could bear . I whirled out of the door and gave it such a good hard bang behind me that the trooper away down at the end of the hall jumped three feet in the air , and came down facing my way and running , with his revolver in his hand . We met at the stairway . " Do n't hurt yourself with your revolver , " I said waspishly . " It was only a door . " And sat down on the top step to brood . Which was an unwise move because the more I brooded the more discouraged I got about it , and the more suspicious the trooper , eyeing me distrustfully from before Drue 's door , looked . But it was n't long that I had to wait ; in fact in a surprisingly short time Alexia came swirling out of Craig 's room , gave me the fraction of a glance and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the look on her face very distinctly because of the distance between us and the dimness of the night lights . But it did strike me then that there was something surprised , yes , and a little disorganized in her usually poised and self-possessed manner . I did n't go to see Drue , then , either ; I did n't want to have to tell her anything . Morning would be all too soon for it to break over her head . Well , I went back to Craig 's room because it was my duty as a nurse . And neither one of us actually spoke another word that night . I arranged his pillows , gave him one of the pills poor , dead Claud Chivery had left for him , and turned out the light beside his bed . He watched me  --  the queer , thoughtful look still in his eyes . IIe did n't give me back the Miller checks , and I did n't ask for them . I had enough clues on my mind  --  or rather , pinned to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with without adding to them . Again I folded up like an accordion on the couch . But not to sleep for a long time . Craig did n't sleep either ; I could tell by the way he turned and twisted . But I would n't have given him an alcohol rub for all the emeralds in Barranquilla . About three , Delphine turned up and yelled at the door , so I had to let him in . He created an unwelcome diversion by bringing in what looked like and was a newly deceased mouse . Before I could bring myself to dispose of the creature , Delphine did it for me with really horrid zeal and sat there licking his chops and enormous whiskers while Craig grinned from the pillows and looked all at once young and boyish and rather nice . Which paradoxically made me crosser than ever . I went back to my couch without a word and eventually I slept . I neither knew nor cared about my patient 's slumbers , except I hoped they were troubled .  | And in the morning early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of us , the police came . It was as I had feared and known it would be . They came directly to Craig 's room and told him . The hypodermic had Drue 's fingerprints on it and mine . There was a very small residue of digitalis in the barrel  --  but enough to identify . They had informed the District Attorney of it and of her fingerprints on the drawer of the desk where Conrad had been accustomed to keep the missing medicine box ( the medicine box that to me was anything but missing ; I only wished it had been ) . Soper , over the telephone , demanded an immediate and formal arrest on a murder charge . But that was n't all . For it was then , when they sent a trooper to bring Drue into the room to be questioned ( Craig , looking terribly white and drawn insisted upon hearing them question her ) , it was then that they found she was gone . She had disappeared during the night ; nobody knew when or how . In her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it was I that counted the row of slender , sturdy little pumps and oxfords . She 'd brought four pair , including some stub-toed red bedroom slippers . They were all there in a row . You do n't go out into the night on purpose without shoes .  | 13 THE trooper , questioned , seemed dazed but insisted , looking frightened , that she could n't have passed him . There were no other exits from her room unless she got out the window and it was a sheer drop for nearly twentyfive feet with no shrubbery at that point to break a fall . At noon they still had n't found her ; the household was nightmarish that morning  --  at fantastic sixes and sevens , with Beevens red-eyed and Craig like a crazy man , his eyes blazing out of a hollow , drawn white mask . We made peace somehow , Craig and I , without knowing it , conscious only of Drue and that little row of slippers . No matter what the police said , I knew it was n't escape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , that started a wideflung , hurried search by telephone , radio and police cars , with alarms sent to neighboring states and hurriedly reinforced squads of state troopers searching the hills . Much of the inquiry itself took place in Craig 's room ; he made Nugent stay there so he could hear everything Soper telephoned frantically with a dozen different theories and directions ; he believed that Drue had escaped .  | Very cleverly , he said ; how , he did n't know ; there were no cars gone from the garage . But he suggested that she 'd got a ride with a passing motorist . And he blamed Nugent for letting her get away . I listened and watched and kept going back in my mind over and over again , seeking for any small thing Drue had said , any hint of an intention to leave , anything at all that would serve to show she had gone of her own accord , willingly . There was nothing . Yet she must have got past the trooper somehow . I kept going back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except for the little dog , Sir Francis , who was still there ; he had been there when they knocked and called to her and opened the door at last and she was gone . He would n't leave , but sat on the foot of her bed , bright eyes terribly watchful and worried . About noon , I think , I took him outdoors and tried to feed and pat him and he struggled away from me and took up his post in Drue 's room again , watching the door , listening . I thought she would have taken him with her if she had gone voluntarily . And she would have told me . It was a horrible , nightmarish day . Yet things happened . The police inquiry , for instance . Nugent 's questions when I gave him the letter I had written about the hypodermic syringe ; I was glad then that I 'd written it , for I 'd put down all the facts about the hypodermic syringe so it explained her fingerprints on the desk drawer ; I 'd said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it but it was gone and it was only then that ! she 'd remembered she had digitalis and had got it and the hypodermic syringe , and given it to him . But I still did n't tell them about the medicine box ; I did n't want them to know she had so much as touched it . Nugent did everything he could do short of sending for bloodhounds , and I 'm not sure he would n't have done that . And I was in the room when Craig told him  | that Beevens had seen Nicky going toward the meadow ( or at least toward the garage ) just before the discovery of Claud 's body . Nicky , questioned , flatly denied it . I heard that , too , for the Lieutenant had Nicky come to Craig 's room . And the curious thing was the flatness and boldness of Nicky 's denial . It sounded true ; his eyes were bright and inquisitive , but he was n't frightened , even when Beevens , summoned also , said he could n't have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismissed them both . Sometime that morning , too ( thinking of what I knew and what I only guessed of the attempt upon Craig 's life ) it occurred to me that if the person who tried to kill Craig was not the same who had killed his father , then an alibi for the time Craig was shot did not automatically constitute an alibi for the time of his father 's or Claud Chivery 's murder . And once , when we were alone , I asked Craig again about that meeting with Alexia in the garden just before he was shot . After a moment 's thought he said , " It was an unintentional meeting . She was walking there too ; she was there when I went down the steps . We walked up and down the paths for a little and then she went back to the house . " " Was it your father who shot you ? " I asked him again directly . And again he would n't answer . And Nugent came back into the room , shook his head to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , sent for Maud . When she came , looking horrible with great dark pockets around her eyes and her face the color of wax , he asked her about the decanter of brandy that stood habitually on Conrad 's desk . For her fingerprints were on it , it developed , and so were mine . I explained my fingerprints on the decanter quickly ; I had touched it . I was shocked , I started to take a drink of brandy , and then did n't . And Maud said in a tight ,  | strained voice that was exactly what she 'd done . " It was a shock to me ; Conrad  --  dead like that . The brandy was on the tray and . . . " It was on the desk , " I said . " No , " said Maud , " it was on the tray . I stood right beside it . I would have noticed if it had been on the desk ; that decanter drips and alcohol ruins the desk top ; I bought the tray for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you touched it , Nurse Keate ? " " I 'm not sure I remember  --  not very much  --  the rim of the brandy came to not more than an inch from the bottom of the decanter . " Maud said , " You 're quite wrong , Nurse . It was more than half full . . . . Nugent said , " Perhaps you are both right . If poison was in the brandy . . . " " Did you find poison in it ? " I cried . " Did you find digitalis in it ? " " No . Not in the brandy that was in the bottle when we arrived that night . But we can find no other way by which Conrad Brent might have , without knowing it , taken poison . He had a habit of drinking brandy at odd times ; it 's why he kept it constantly on his desk . Poisoned brandy may have been put in that decanter while he was out for his walk . In that case , he returned , drank it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was empty the poisoned brandy was removed from the decanter ( there 's that little washroom on the other side of the panel ; the poisoned brandy could easily have been poured down the drain and washed away with water from the faucet ) and ordinary brandy put back in the decanter . It could have been done , like that . It 's a good thing you did n't drink any , Miss Keate , " he said a little drily . I was thinking that myself , rather vehemently . He went on , " Conrad had to get the poison , somehow . It 's  | the only way that has n't been eliminated  --  so far as I can discover , at any rate . All that method needed were three things  --  the digitalis , a knowledge of the household and where to get more brandy , and opportunity to make the change after Conrad was dead . " He looked at me gravely ; I think he felt sorry for me . I know he was almost as frantic as I was , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled himself better and went on about his job . Constantly , every few moments , there would be a report from someone  --  somewhere  --  looking for Drue . Troopers mainly , tall and well built and military-looking in their dark , trim uniforms , in the way they snapped into the room , snapped to attention , took their orders , snapped out again . But still time went on and there was no news . He stopped then to listen to a report of a girl picked up near Northampton . It was n't Drue ; this girl was five feet eight and had black hair and wore a lambskin coat . ( She turned out , as a matter of fact , to be an innocent Smith College Senior out for a walk and was highly indignant . ) And then he went back to Maud . " Mrs. Chivery , I must ask you again . If you know you must tell me . Why was your husband killed ? " Maud shrank back , her eyes sunken deep in her face , her black dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . I 've told you that many times ! " And Craig , watching and listening , gray with anxiety , leaned forward . " Maud  --  Claud said you quarreled . Lately . About money . What was it ? " She whirled on him . " I did n't murder Claud , " she said . " Why did you quarrel ? " She eyed him for a moment , her little face taking on a deep , queer flush . Then she told him . " It was an  --  an investment I wanted to make . He thought it unwise and  | refused to sell some bonds we owned together . That 's all . It was nothing . " " What investment ? " She refused to tell . " It 's a secret , " she said . " It has nothing to do with this . " I said , rather absently really , for I did n't think Maud or anybody in his senses was out to buy a Spanish castle just then . " Truckloads of jewels . " Maud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there was alarm in her eyes . " I do n't know what you mean ! " she cried sharply . I did n't either ; but I could and did quote her words to me over the nickels , and quite explicitly . " Nonsense , " said Maud flatly . " I said nothing of the kind  --  or if I did , it meant nothing . " There was a silence  --  and again that look of concentration in Craig 's eyes . And another trooper came in to say that the knife that had killed Chivery came from the Brent kitchen ; Beevens , he said was willing to swear to it . But no one knew just when it disappeared . It was all written down in shorthand . Maud silently disappeared and I think it was just after that that Beevens himself made his not inconsiderable contribution to the thing . " It 's about the vase , sir , " he said to Nugent , his blue eyes worried . " Or rather , I mean about the noise  --  the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Brent  --  died . " " What do you mean ? " said Nugent . Craig got up on his elbow to listen . I stood there , in my starched white uniform , at the foot of the bed . I could n't seem to settle down and it did no good to prowl the corridors and look out the windows and keep going back to Drue 's room . " I think I know what it was , sir , " said Beevens and told his queer little story . He 'd felt all along , and Mr. Craig had agreed with him , he said , with a side glance  | at Craig , that whatever that sound had been it had not indicated an intruder in the house and that therefore it must have some special significance . It was not , in other words , accident . " So I took a look around , " said Beevens . " This morning I found it . " " Found what ? " " The vase , sir , broken in fifteen or twenty pieces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shoved into the bottom of one of the ash barrels . The ash barrels , " said Beevens austerely , " are removed once a week by a truck from the village . There was also a large , thick twine  --  at least twenty feet long , and one end of it was tied around the lower part of the vase . The kind of twine that I keep in my pantry for tying up parcels ; anybody could have taken it . " He went on to elaborate , and he had a theory . It was a large vase , at least three feet high , he said , and heavy . Its rightful place was on a table in the second-floor corridor . He had n't missed it because the household had been so upset that he had n't really taken a look around the upper hall as he usually did ( regularly ) just to be sure it was all in order , but had left it entirely to the housemaid . And she had apparently assumed that he had removed the vase . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with the result that he believed it had been placed at the top of , possibly , the back stairs . " With the other end of the twine at the bottom of the stairs , perhaps , " said Beevens , and stopped significantly . Nugent 's green eyes were narrow . Craig said , " You mean somebody placed it there and hung the string down the stairway and then gave it a jerk at the right time from below . " " It would fall , I believe , " said Beevens , " in a series of thuds upon the treads which would sound extremely loud at night . It broke , perhaps at the bottom of the  | service stairs  --  which accounts for the crash the nurse mentions and which I myself heard . However , the pieces of the vase must have been picked up at once and hidden " He looked a little bleak . " I do n't know who could have done it . But it was a very heavy vase . " Craig turned to Nugent . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  or Miss Ideate or both of them out of the library , of course . " Nugent 's green eyes were intent . " So whoever was waiting to dispose of the poisoned brandy could do so . But who picked up the pieces and hid them before we got here ? There was nothing there when we looked , and whoever changed the brandy had to work fast . It 's impossible for anybody to be in two places at once . " " Yes , sir , " said Beevens respectfully and stubbornly . " You might look at the pieces of the vase for fingerprints , sir . " " Well , naturally , " said Nugent . " The wrapping paper , too . Although I doubt . . . Where was the vase , as a rule ? " " On a table at the south end of the corridor , sir . " " South . Then anyone carrying it to the back stairs would have to pass this door . H 'm  --  the back stairs and the front stairs are not far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . Well , " Nugent looked at me . " You heard something bump against the door shortly before Drue Cable screamed . When , presumably , the murderer realized that there would have to be a sure-fire device to get her out of the library before anyone came in order to change the brandy . Was it the vase ? " " It could have been . Yes . It must have been an accident ... " Naturally . But when you opened the door you really saw no one ? " " But I 've told you that . There was n't anyone . "  | " Did you go to the door immediately ? " " Yes , " I said . " That is , no . I mean I was a little surprised . I waited for a few seconds and then went . . . " You waited long enough for whoever was there to have time to get away ? " . " Yes , I suppose so . " He did n't say " What a help you are " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your vicinity lately ? " " No , " I said . But thought nevertheless of the sense of threat that had crept like a live thing , like a wolf prowling and secretly waiting for prey , into every corner and every shadow and every empty room of that ill-fated house . Well . Nugent sent for Nicky then and Peter . Peter came first and when he heard of the hypothesis of the broken vase , said he thought it very likely . I watched him closely , for by that time I suspected everybody , but his boyish , blunt face looked merely worried and sorry and perplexed . " But I did n't see anyone , " he said . " I glanced down the back stairwa ; , too , and all along the corridors in the back of the house . I thought a window had been broken , from the sound . " " Did you see any pieces of the vase ? " asked Nugent , " No . But I was n't looking for that . I was looking for a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " did you see Nicky anywhere ? I mean , in the corridor , on the stairs  --  anywhere ? " " No . But I kept thinking there was a thief or some kind of intruder . I opened a couple of windows and hung out each one trying to see someone but did n't . It 's the dark of the moon and was cloudy . Finally I heard voices and came back downstairs . Everybody was very upset . Maud was crying at the telephone . Nicky was in the library when I got downstairs again . " Nicky , when questioned , again simply denied know-  | ing anything of vase , stairway or twine . " Why would I do anything like that ? " he said calmly . " I did n't murder Conrad . I know nothing about it . I did n't fix up anything like that to get Drue and Miss Keate out of the library . Why should I ? I was sound asleep when the sound that you say was the vase rolling downstairs and breaking awakened me . Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was none . I got up and made another fruitless trip around the house  --  to her room , up and down the stairs , into the library . I do n't know what I was doing , really . When I got back Peter and Nicky were gone and Craig had given Nugent the Frederic Miller checks . I do n't know why he had n't given them to him sooner , unless it was because all that day Craig was fighting a queer kind of battle inside himself . He was like a man groping in the dark for a formless thing he had never seen , whose presence he could only surmise . And whose existence , even if he proved it , was still not evidence of murder . But he told Nugent everything he dared to tell him . " I did n't know this till last night , " he said , their heads close together over the endorsed , canceled checks made out to Frederic Miller . " But I think I know what they are . And I think it may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nugent 's eyes glittered green fire . Craig said wearily , . " I did n't at first connect it with my father 's death . I ca n't really connect it now  --  except the checks ought not to have been found where they were found . " " Where ought they to be ? " " In his desk , of course , " said Craig . " He kept all cancelled checks for five years . He kept them together , by the month and year , in one of the big drawers of his desk . Obviously they were removed . He may have removed them himself . Or Alexia may have done so . Certainly she  | must have known they were there , below the suede jewel case . Nugent looked at me . " Exactly how and where did you find them ? " he asked , although Craig had already covered the main points of my discovery . I told him , however , in detail . When I 'd finished he looked for a long time at the checks . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . So far as I know , I 've never seen it before . Of course , one does n't remember handwriting accurately . But I 've been thinking of that , too . " " We can investigate ; we will . " He turned the checks over again to look at the cancellation . " They 've been cashed at different banks . " " Yes , I noticed that , " said Craig . " Two in New York City and one in Newark . Presumably this Frederic Miller was well enough known at each bank to cash the checks . Obviously he either had accounts in these banks or some other means of identification . " " M 'm , " said Nugent , which was not illuminating . With me the thought of time was uppermost . Time and Drue . I said , " By the time you investigate those checks and , if luck is with you , identify and locate Frederic Miller  --  well , anything could happen . You ca n't do it in a day . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day . The F.B.I . are always ready to help with anything like this , and they have a vast system of records . " " What 's in your mind , Nugent ? " asked Craig suddenly . " I 'm not sure that anything is there , " said Nugent . His words were candid but his look evasive . Craig said , " Do you think this Miller has got involved with the law at some time ? " " It 's always possible , " said Nugent.  | " But . . . " began Craig and then stopped , and Nugent said , " What were you going to say , Brent ? " " Well , it 's  --  it 's nothing really . Except I 've had all night to think about it , you see , and to wonder why those particular checks were removed from the others , yet not destroyed . And why they were found just there . If Alexia knows , she may tell and she may not tell . I do n't see how she could help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she put them there . But why ? " " Exactly . Why ? I 'll talk to her . But in the meantime , there 's something you want to say , Brent . Is n't there ? Better get it out . " " All right , " said Craig slowly . " It 's not very pleasant . But it was only a  --  a prejudice on his part . It did n't last long . It 's comprehensible . And I know that after the war began he had an abrupt change of heart . He still did n't ? well , did n't really want me to go into the air force ; that is , he used my wish to do so as a lever for something else he wanted . . . . " Craig glanced briefly at me , and Nugent said nothing . Craig went on , " But the fact is for  --  oh , for years he has been  --  or rather had been  --  well . . . " Germanic in sympathy , " said Nugent quietly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you know ? " " Obvious , " said Nugent . " Coat of arms in his study was of early German origin . I looked it up in a history of Heraldry . There are numerous books about genealogy in his study , too . I questioned the servants in detail . He was very proud of his family line and of his descent . " " Yes , " said Craig , " but it did n't mean anything , really . It was only a kind of hobby with him . He read Geiuian history , you know ; loved it when some early robber baron , or later statesman , or title was connected with his family . He was always like that . During the First World War though , lie swerved instantly around ; he was all on the side of the Allies and against Germany . I knew he would do the same thing when this war came and he did . "  | " But in the interstice ? " said Nugent . " In the interstice , " said Craig , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere theory on his pari . Merely a hobby . He was very proud of family , you see . And , as I say , had made a kind of study of German history and legend . When Hitler began his rise to power , my father was very taken with the ideas of encouraging the youth movements , bringing back the old German ideas of family life , that kind of thing . It was purely theoretical on my father 's part . He had no faint idea of the real brutality and ruthlessness which lay behind all their talk . He would n't believe it for a time , even when it was increasingly evident to everybody else in the world . He was like that , you know ; once lie took a stand he  --  well , he clung to it . Blindly . " Nugent said nothing ; I thought of my early impression of Conrad Brent and the obstinacy I had suspected resulted from an inner and ashamed weakness . Craig said , " He had changed . Believe me , Nugent . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathies lay . The other was merely a notion ; nothing that really meant anything to him . He was patriotic and sincere . It was only that it was hard for my father to retreat publicly from a stand he had taken . " " Do you mean , " said Nugent , " that these checks were somehow connected with sabotage or anything of the kind ? " " Good God , no , " cried Craig . " He 'd never have done that . " " What then ? " " I tell you I do n't know . But that night  --  the night he died  --  you remember the clipping . " " The clipping that was in his desk and that Mrs. Brent went and got for him , during the bridge game ? Certainly . It " ? Nugent 's eyes were bright , dark slits ? " it was about the arrest of some Bund members . "  | " Right , " said Craig looking very tired . " Alexia might know where the clipping is now . What happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , briefly , is that before the war began your father may have donated this money to some branch of the Bund , here in the United States . " " I do n't know , " said Craig . " But it would have been like him . He had money ; he was curiously idealistic and curiously blind to reality until something happened to ? well , give him a jolt . Make him see the truth . I do n't know whether that actually happened or not . But I do n't know of anybody by the name of Frederic Miller . I ca n't think of any reason for my father to give anybody such substantial sums of money . It seems to me that it must have been quite outside his business affairs . " " You must have some definite reason for connecting the checks with the Bund . " " No , " said Craig . " I do n't have . I knew nothing of it . I ca n't remember hearing him talk of the Bund  --  in any special way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commented pretty strongly and adversely about it . It was only the existence of that clipping and the mystery of these checks that started me thinking and putting them together with my father 's previous  --  and lately altogether changed  --  views . The dates on the checks , too , would have corresponded with the period during which my father was theoretically favorable to the announced German plan . That was the year before the war ; he never believed there would be a war . He swallowed everything the Germans then claimed , false though their claims were . It was when war actually began that abruptly again he came out in his true colors . He was honestly patriotic ; the sympathy he thought he had for Germany was a completely unreal and assumed sympathy . When it came to the pinch he realized it himself . " " But you think that before the war he gave these  | checks to the Bund and that Frederic Miller was a Bund member . " " I do n't know , " said Craig . " I was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There may be a completely different explanation . I may be shooting very wide of the mark . But the clipping had some special interest for him . He would n't have kept it otherwise . And somebody said  --  I think Pete told me  --  that it was about the arrest of some Bund members . " " That 's all you know ? " said Nugent . " I do n't know that , " said Craig . " It 's only a guess . " " It 's one I can easily check up , " said Nugent . " I 'll get on the telephone right away . And I 'll send these checks in for investigation right away , too . And since it 's fairly safe to assume that somebody in the household removed these checks from the desk , the next thing to do is to inquire about that . If you 're right in your theory , Brent . .. " " It 's not a theory exactly , " interposed Craig . " It 's just the only thing I could think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . If you are right , then someone in the household knew of it . And blackmail is the answer to that . Could your father have been blackmailed in that way ? " " I 'm not sure . Yes , I think he could have been . If most men had made a mistake like that , they 'd have no compunction about it later . I mean they would be ashamed of it , and probably would n't want it known . Still , they would n't permit themselves to be blackmailed on the strength of it ; they 'd prefer making a clean breast of it , and trying to make amends for their mistake . But not my father . He was very proud . Yes , " said Craig slowly , " I think he might have let himself be blackmailed . Up to a point , that is . " " A point that stopped short of murder ? " asked Nugent.  | " Certainly , " said Craig . " But it was my father who was murdered . So that does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was of no value to a blackmailer dead . That 's the brutal truth of it . " " M 'm , " said Nugent aggravatingly . And just then in the corridor outside I heard heavy , quick footsteps and knew it was another report and , as always that dreadful day when someone came to speak to Nugent , my heart got up into my throat . Craig 's did , too , I think , for his head jerked toward the door . But again it was only a trooper to say they were searching the north meadow and there was nothing to report except a rifle . " Rifle ? " " Yes , sir . " It was an old rifle which had belonged to the handyman ; he 'd used it now and then for shooting squirrels or rats , but he had n't used it for over a year , he 'd told them , and he 'd left it , he was sure , in the old loft over the garage . It had been found in some brush in the meadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were no shells in it ; but they believed it had recently been fired . Nugent gave brief orders about it ( they were to go over it for fingerprints ; he would talk to the handyman ) , then he looked at me . " Your hunter , " he said . And then Nugent sent for Alexia and she , too , came as the others had done and sat there  --  composed and calm but with a face so pinched about the nostrils , so curiously hard about the mouth and eyes that she looked ill and not at all beautiful . And she said flatly ( as flatly as Nicky had made his own denials about the vase ) that she knew nothing of the checks . Said it straight out , promptly , and looked as if she were going to die then and there . Which struck me as singular ; it was the first time I had seen Alexia look as if any of it really affected her .  | Nugent persisted . " Did you ever see these checks be-fore ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ? " " No . " " Fifteen thousand dollars is a substantial sum of money . " " Yes . But I knew nothing of Conrad 's affairs . Besides , as you see , these were written in 1938 . Before my marriage . " " Mrs. Brent , are you willing to swear that you did not take these checks from your husband 's desk and put them in the cupboard of your room ? " " Certainly , " said Alexia quickly . " When did you last open the cupboard ? " There was a short pause . Then Alexia , her eyes shadowed and secretive , said she did n't know . " Perhaps several days ago . I really ca n't remember . Except that if the checks had been there when I last looked , I would have seen them . " " Do you know Frederic Miller ? " asked Nugent pointblank . " No , " said Alexia.  | 19 AND they could get nothing else out of her . Anybody in the house , she said , could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , bright look when she was told that I had found the checks and there was something in her look that actually started a kind of chill up my back . Anybody could have put the checks there , just as anybody  --  again she looked at me fixedly and brightly  --  could have taken them . Conrad 's desk was never locked . And when questioned about Conrad 's former sympathy for the German cause she said that , of course , everyone knew where his sympathies had lain . " Had he ever been interested in the various Bund organizations ? " asked Nugent . " I do n't know . " " Do you remember the clipping you said you took from his desk ? At the time you said you saw the box of medicine . " " Yes . Certainly . " " Did you read it ? " " Yes . I read it aloud . He asked me to . " " Can you remember what it was about ? "  | " I told you . It concerned the arrest of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given , I suppose . " She hesitated but only briefly . " No , I believe not . I really do n't remember . So much has happened since then . And it was not important . " " What did you do with it ? " " With the clipping ? Why , I  --  really I do n't know . My husband asked me to read it and I did . I believe I gave it to him then . Or perhaps I put it on a table . We were having coffee in the library . I do n't remember . Why are you asking me about it ? " " Who was in the room at the time ? " Her slender black eyebrows drew together . " I 'm not sure that I remember that , exactly , either . My husband and I , of course . It was immediately after dinner . Mrs. Chivery was there . I suppose my brother and Peter Huber were there , too . " " Ca n't you remember definitely ? " She gave a little shrug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't believe I 'd be able to swear to any one of them except , of course , my husband . But I think the other three were in the room . " " Mrs. Brent , try to remember this . Was it your impression that anyone in the room had a special interest in hearing the clipping read ? " I could read nothing in her beautiful , delicate face . She said very promptly , " No one but my husband . And I 've no idea why he was interested , " and looked at Nugent with a touch of silken and adroit defiance . It did not , naturally , satisfy Nugent . He waited a moment and then said directly , " What about your brother ? " " My brother ? " asked Alexia . " It 's much better , Mrs. Brent , to answer me truthfully and as fully as you can . Much better for everybody , believe me. "  | " But really . . . " Her voice was cool and polite ; her eyebrows arched in delicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had nothing to do with the arrest of any members of any Bund . He has never had any sympathy for Germany . He is not interested in politics . " " How old is your brother ? " Her voice was still cool , and polite . " My age , of course . Twenty-five . " " He 's registered for the draft ? " " Certainly . I 've forgotten his class . He can tell you . " " You and your brother lived abroad for some time , did n't you ? " " When we were children , yes . I do n't understand your question , Lieutenant . " I was under a slight and I trusted erroneous impression that the Lieutenant did n't know exactly what he was getting at either ; he only kept digging in the hope of unearthing something . He said , " What of Peter Huber ? " Craig started to speak , but Alexia replied , " You know everything I know of him , Lieutenant . He 's been here about a month . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me see . According to his story he went to school in Southern California . " " I believe so , " said Alexia . " Did n't you check his statements ? I understood that was part of your job . " " You are quite right , " said Nugent , unruffled . " I 'm afraid I 've forgotten his home . I mean the name of the town . What was it , Brent ? " " Pete 's home ? " said Craig . " I do n't know . I know where he went to school . I think he lived somewhere near Monterey . I 'm not sure . Does it matter ? " " Do you remember his most recent address ? " asked Nugent . " Well , he had to come from somewhere , " said Craig . " I think he said Hollywood . He was trying to get a job in the movies . I do remember that . I suppose a Holly-  | wood address is the logical surmise in that case . Besides that 's where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Nugent . " Who 's he ? " " Fellow Pete knows . And I know . Went to school with Pete ; that is , university . He  --  Bill , I mean  --  was in my class at prep school . Yes , I 'm sure Pete came from Hollywood here . " " Is that your impression , Mrs. Brent ? " " Really , " said Alexia . " If you 've forgotten , I 'd suggest your asking him . Peter is nothing to me , you know . I never saw him before Conrad met him at the inn , in the village , and brought him here . " " That was about a month ago . " " Yes , " said Alexia . " Lieutenant , why are you asking me about Peter ? I was under an impression that you had not omitted him in your general inquiry . I ca n't confirm anything about him , if that is what you want . " Nugent got out a little black notebook and turned a few pages . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were both right . It was a Hollywood address he gave us . " I was sure somehow , in spite of his quiet voice that he had remembered all along and thus had only been testing Craig and Alexia ? but testing them for what ( aside from their knowledge of Peter and of Nicky ) I did n't know . He said , " Yes , of course , how could I have forgotten ! And Nicky " ? he turned another leaf . " Nicholas Senour , brother-in-law to deceased . M-m-m . Apartment on East Fifty-sixth street in New York . Lives mainly at Brent home . Traveled extensively in Europe as a child ; last trip made in . . . " He squinted hard at the writing , although from where I stood it looked perfectly neat and legible and said , " Ca n't make this out . When was his last trip abroad , Mrs. Brent , and where did he go ? " " It was in 1937 , " said Alexia , " and he went to Italy . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . What does he do for a living ? "  | Alexia bit her full underlip . " He does n't do anything , " she said . " Oh . You inherited money , I presume . You and your brother . " She hesitated and then said , " A little . Not much . " " I see . " He closed the book suddenly and leaned forward . " Mrs. Brent , what about those checks made out to your brother ? Were they for any specific service ? Please answer . " She waited a few seconds , her eyes shadowed again by her dark eyelashes , then she looked up . " Lieutenant , that has nothing to do with my husband 's death , or with the murder of Dr. Chivery . Nicky needed some money , of course ; he 's young and has no source of income . My husband knew that it would please me if he saw to it that Nicky had a little money , that 's all . " " And Nicky lives here , mainly ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate . Before that we shared his apartment in New York . " " So you know most of his friends ? " " Why , I  --  yes , I should think so , " said Alexia . " Did he know Peter Huber ? " " No , of course not . None of us knew him . " " Were any of your friends at all interested in politics ? " " Why , I  --  really , I do n't remember . " There was a tinge of uncertainty in her voice , yet it was nothing that seemed exactly significant . It was more as if she could not discover the trend of Nugent 's questions . If so , she was soon enlightened however . For Nugent leaned forward , his lean face suddenly as sharp as a hatchet . " Who is Frederic Miller ? " he asked again , abruptly . But he got the same answer . " I do n't know , " said Alexia . " I do n't have the faintest idea . " And again looked white and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her denial . He  | said . " Try to think back , Mrs. Brent ; try to remember . " And added , " You told me that you had not seen Drue Cable since last night when you saw her going from this room to her own room . You are sure you did n't see her at any later time ? " " Perfectly sure , " said Alexia . " You do n't know where she is ? " " Certainly not . She would n't have taken me into her confidence before she escaped , I assure you . " " Did you send her a message of any sort ? " " No , " said Alexia , and rose . " If that is all , Lieutenant ... He nodded . " Send Mrs. Chivery in here , will you please ? " Alexia went away rather abruptly . She looked a little shaken , it seemed to me , but by no means ready to break down and tell all . If , that is , there was anything for her to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her small , beautiful face was merely a look and nothing else . Still , it seemed to me that she must have known something of the Frederic Miller checks . After all , they had been found in the cupboard in her own room . That was not , however , proof and I realized it . Maud must have been in the hall , for Alexia had scarcely gone when Maud appeared silently in the doorway and , at Nugent 's gesture , came in . She was preceded by a wave of violet sachet ; her taffeta petticoat rustled sibilantly and her little dark eyes had brown pockets around them . " May I ask a few more questions , Mrs. Chivery ? " began Nugent and , as she gave a brief , birdlike little nod , he asked her pointblank , as he had asked Alexia , if she knew anything of a man named Frederic Miller . And when she thought for a moment , fixing her bright eyes upon him and tilting her black pompadour to one side ,  | and then finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the checks and showed them to her . She looked at them for a long time and very thought , fully ; studying the dates , the endorsements , the cancella , tions . She looked at them indeed for so long a time and with such an intent and thoughtful expression in her whitely powdered face that I was suddenly conscious of the fact that I was watching and listening intently for her reply . And so were Nugent and Craig . I glanced at them and they were watching her as intently as she was examining the checks . But when she looked up she said flatly , " No , I do n't know anything about them . " Nugent said slowly , " Mrs. Chivery , is there anything those checks , or anything about those checks , reminded you of ? Just now when you first saw them ? " " N-no , " she said , and handed him the checks . " You 're sure ? " " Yes . That is . . . " she hesitated . And then said with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment I thought  --  but I was quite mistaken . " " What did you think ? " said Nugent very gently . " I was mistaken , " said Maud . " The dates are wrong . " " Wrong for what ? " asked Nugent . " Wrong for  --  well , " said Maud again with a kind of burst , " wrong for the kind of investment I thought he might have been making . " Nugent leaned back in his chair . " You 'd better tell me exactly what you mean , Mrs. Chivery . " " But it  --  it has nothing to do with the murder . I ca n't tell you . I . . . " " What investment ? " said Nugent . And I remembered Maud 's fuzzy phrases about Spain and jewels and said suddenly , surprising myself , " Spanish jewels ? " At which she shot me a dark , intent look . And said simply , " Yes . " Which further surprised me.  | And before anyone could question or say anything she got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , " she said . " But I do know that I was approached about an investment , and I believe that Conrad might have been approached , too . But these dates are all wrong . The Spanish jewels ? well , never mind that . . . Nugent got up , too . Craig watched intently , yet with no expression whatever in his face . Nugent said , " You 'll have to explain what you mean , Mrs. Chivery . At once . " " No , " said Maud . " I do n't have to . That 's enough . I do n't know anything about your Frederic Miller checks . Have you heard from the girl ? " " Miss Cable ? No , " said Nugent , and looked quickly at Craig and said , " That is , not yet . " Maud said , " Look here , Lieutenant . I 've been thinking . I 'm not sure that I 've been on the right side of the ? of this affair . I 've thought from the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But somehow I  --  well , I do n't think she killed Claud . I do n't know what to do . That is , I have no knowledge that is a clue . I do n't know who killed Conrad or who killed Claud . The only thing that I know of and have n't wanted to tell you is the matter of the investment I spoke of just now . But I did not make the investment ; obviously these checks were not connected with that , either . I 'll tell you all about that , if you want to know . I 'll tell you tomorrow . But not . . . " " Why tomorrow ? " " No reason , " said Maud after a moment . " I  --  no reason . You 'll have to believe me , for I " ? she thought for another second or two and then said firmly , " I merely prefer it that way . And it really has nothing to do with the murder of Conrad or the murder of Claud . And it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips set tightly together . And Nugent could not shake her . She merely shook  | her head obstinately with its high black pompadour and refused to tell him , even when he brought all the force of law and argument against her . Craig said wearily , " You ca n't withhold information , you know , Maud . " And Maud said , " Ca n't I ? " And did . So in the end , only to save time , I imagine , Nugent let the thing rest and asked her what she knew of Drue 's disappearance , and she said and insisted that she knew nothing and had not seen or talked to Drue for at least twentyfour hours . Finally they let her go . Nugent looked baffled and Craig angry . " There are points , " said Nugent , " to the earlier forms of medieval torture . " Craig said slowly , " But Maud is honest , as a rule . And I think Claud 's death has changed her view of the whole thing . I think what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of  --  of . . . " " Law and order , " suggested Nugent . " Yes . In a sense . " " Well , she 's not doing a very good job of cooperating . Whose Spanish jewels ? And where are they ? " " Probably in Spain , " said Craig . " Maud was made for a sucker 's list . The point is to find Drue . All these other things can wait , ca n't they ? " " Unless they can be made to point the way to Drue , " said Nugent . " I 'll do what I can with these checks . " " For God 's sake , do it quickly , " said Craig with a kind of groan . It was , I believe , just then that the trooper who 'd been on guard in the hall the night before came to Nugent . I had n't realized until I saw him in the direct gray light from the windows how young he was . A boy , really , bony and tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look of desperation . But he had the courage to tell  | Nugent the truth  --  and then stand there biting his lip , but with his young eyes direct , waiting what came . I do n't know what his punishment was ; even then I felt sorry for him . But the point was that Anna had gone to Drue 's room about eleven ( to turn down the beds , she 'd told the boy who 'd believed her ) ; she 'd stayed with Drue , talking , for a while . Then she 'd gone away but later  --  very much later , perhaps two in the morning  --  had brought him some coffee . He drank it , of course ; and presently remembered sitting in a chair which faced Drue 's door . And that was all he 'd remembered until he awoke , with a queer taste in his mouth , about six in the morning . Nobody knew what Anna had put in the coffee ; until I went and looked in my little instrument bag and some sedative I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And when they sent for Anna , she was gone , too . They found then  --  something after noon it was , I think ? the bloodstained , yellow string glove  --  the mate to the one found near Claud Chivery ; it was hidden under her flat , narrow little mattress . But they did n't find Anna . Oddly enough no one had missed her  --  oddly , but still comprehensibly . She had been ill and hysterical the day before ; Beevens had told her to take that day off , to stay in her room and rest ; Gertrude was to do Anna 's work for her . In searching for Drue they had not ( consequently informed of Anna 's illness by Gertrude ) entered Anna 's room . It was an oversight , which only went to prove that such things ( homely , trivial , perfectly understandable things like that ) do happen and do complicate any police inquiry . Nugent was furious and so were the troopers responsible for the omission , especially when they found the glove , which certainly ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicion toward Anna in a  | definite , material way that all my own odd encounters with the maid had never suggested . Certainly , however , Anna 's disappearance completed our demoralization . Craig said , " They went together . They must have gone together . So Drue 's  --  not alone . . . " and something like hope quickened in his eyes . But I was afraid . So I told Nugent in detail all I knew of Anna  --  footsteps running from the meadow in the dusk ? a black eye  --  an impression that someone was in her room with her and that she was frightened . It was too little , however , and too tenuous a story . Nugent looked at the small , black notebook again . " We 've questioned the servants , " he said , " over and over . Anna was nervous but she seemed to know nothing . . . " he stopped , frowning , and then read aloud : " William Fansh.awe Beevens  --  British birth , age fifty-four ; Gertrude Schieffel , American birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are  --  Anna Haub , German birth , age thirty-six , came to America from Bavaria fourteen years ago , in employ of Conrad Brent since 1929 , no former police record . That 's all . " His lean dark face was so concentrated with thought it made me think again of a dark , sharp hatchet with glowing green eyes  --  which I realize however would be more or less in the nature of a phenomenon . " No former police record . No suspicious facts . She lived a quiet , hard-working life , apparently perfectly honest and devoted to the Brent family . Devoted . . . " he said thoughtfully , and looked at Craig who shook his head . " I do n't think she had any interest whatever in Germany or in the Bund . She must have left some kind of family in Germany  --  but if so I ca n't remember ever hearing of any of them . No , I do n't think Anna would be likely to know anything of the Frederic Miller checks . Even if our surmise should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miller actually was somebody interested in the Bund . Anna was n't smart enough , in just that way , I mean . She was shrewd but not  --  not scheming . Not clever . " " What do you think has happened to her ? " " God knows , " said Craig . " If they 're together though , she and Drue , there 's some hope . . . I had let him get up again and sit in a chair , wrapped in a long camel 's hair dressing-gown ; he put his face then in his hands with a kind of desperate gesture . It was after he knew about Anna that he redoubled his efforts to do something that , he was convinced , only he could do . Twice already , that day ( when I was out of the room ) he 'd tried to walk  --  once getting as far as the linen room again and the second time halfway down the stairs where he was found sitting , dizzily clinging to the bannisters , by one of the troopers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon , with still no news , he sent me on a pretext to the kitchen , and this time he got as far as trousers and a sweater , and the fireplace bench of the lower hall . I found him there myself grimly upright , clinging to the bench with his eyes shut as if the room was going around him . Peter helped me get him back to his room . And it was then that we had our long and curiously illuminating , and at the same time curiously baffling talk . It was long , that is , in content , not in time . All of us , I know , were strongly aware of the passage of time . It was growing dusk in the room , I remember , although it was still light outside with the clear , cold light of a late winter 's afternoon . And Drue 's disappearance was still unexplained . Peter eased Craig down into a chair and then stood there looking rather ruefully down at him . " You 'd better go back to bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | " Well , then , " said Peter , " let me be your leg man . Just tell me whatever you want me to do and I 'll do it . If I can . " " Find Drue , of course , " said Craig , his head back against the cushion and his face white . I got some spirits of ammonia and in my agitation held the bottle too close to his nose . He sat up abruptly , gasping , and Peter said soberly , " I wish I could . I 've helped look , you know . She 's not in the house . She 's not in the barns or the greenhouse . I looked myself and the police looked , too , of course . My opinion is , Craig , that she went away of her own will . Voluntarily . She must have gone like that because otherwise she would have been heard in the house . Even if the guard was drugged he would have roused , I should thick , if she 'd screamed or made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All of us would have heard it . She went of her own will . I feel sure of that . " " But what happened afterward ? " said Craig . " Why did she go like that ? Why is Anna with her ? " " Are you sure that Anna went with her ? " asked Peter . " Or do we just feel that they must be together because they are both gone ? " " I 'm not sure of anything , " said Craig , and pushed away the bottle of ammonia . " For God 's sake , get that thing out of the way ! If Chivery was murdered because he knew too much of my father 's death , then maybe Drue knew the same thing . Maybe she . . . " He stopped as if unable to say it . And Peter said quickly , " Craig , if anything had happened to her , they 'd have found  --  well , found her by now . " " Then why does n't she telephone ? Why does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't she . . . " Craig stopped again and put his hand over his face . I said , " Why did n't you tell her how you felt about her ? Then she would n't have gone away without telling you . "  | " She does n't love me , " said Craig from behind the hand that shaded his eyes . " It 's Nicky she was in love with . She feels sorry for me now ; and she feels it her duty to take care of me . " I started to expostulate and then stopped . What was the use ! The more desperately I worked to get the two blind young idiots together the farther they swung apart . Everything , it seemed to me , combined to separate them . Even though they were actually in the same house , Drue had been made to stay in her room , and Craig could n't move ten feet under his own steam , so to speak , without collapsing . And now they were in truth separated and there was no way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was right and she had gone of her own volition ) she had gone . I felt as Craig did , however ; if she could have telephoned to me I was sure she would have done so . It did n't lift my spirits to reflect on that . I said waspishly to Craig , " You ought to have told her you wanted her to stay . Instead , you asked Alexia to marry you . " Peter lifted his eyebrows . " I thought it was Drue you liked , " he said . " Alexia said no , " said Craig after a pause . " Oh , " said Peter . " Do you want Alexia to marry you ? " I asked directly , and Craig said after another pause , " No . " " Good God , " said Peter . " What 's the idea ? " " I wanted to see if she would , " said Craig simply . Which got me nowhere . I was staring at Craig in furious exasperation , and Peter was staring rather blankly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand over his eyes when someone knocked and came in and it was Nugent . " I got a report on the Frederic Miller checks , " he said abruptly . " Do you want to hear ? " Did we want to hear ! Peter 's rather large ears stretched  | another fraction of an inch and Craig snapped , " Go on . What 'd you find out ? " " Frederic Miller , " said Nugent , " was a member of the New Jersey Bund . He lived in Newark at least for a time . He appears to have lived in New York , too . Sometime during the fall of 1938 he disappeared . Probably got wind of the fact that the activities of the Bund members were being watched pretty closely by the F.B.I . At any rate he disappeared and covered his tracks pretty thoroughly . The checks however were credited to his account at the Newark bank  --  the bank whose stamp appears on the back of one of the checks . The account was closed before he left the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's as far as they could tell me at a moment 's notice . They will investigate further . " Craig said quickly , " Were there any pictures of Mil-ler ? " " I asked that , too , " said Nugent . " No . But they said they 'd be able to find somebody who could identify him . " " Then Mr. Brent was helping the Bund , " said Peter . " Presumably . Unless Miller used the money himself . However , that end of it comes under the jurisdiction of the F.B.I . They 'll run the thing down if anybody can . As a matter of fact , this angle interests them in the whole +case and I do n't mind telling you it 'll be a help . The trouble is it 'll take time . " " But do n't they know anything else about Frederic Miller ? " asked Craig . " No , " said Nugent . " He was just one of the Bund ; all of the ringleaders were kept under pretty close scrutiny . They knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know whether he was young or old ; born in Germany or in America ; anything in fact about him except what I 've told you . The point is that it could have been an assumed name . " " Frederic Miller , " said Craig thoughtfully . " The  | trouble is too that there 's nobody around here who could be Frederic Miller . " " And if there were , " said Peter , " why should he murder Mr. Brent ? And Dr. Chivery ? " " The checks bring him into it , " said Nugent . " If I knew how , the case might be ended here and now . And again , " he added , " it might not be . But if it was an assumed name it could be anyone . You , Brent . Or you , Huber . Or Nicky . Or even a woman . . . " " It 's not me , " said Craig , and Peter said , " Gosh , " in a heartfelt manner . And Nugent said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , it is n't , " I snapped . " You can check back over my whole history if you want to . " " Thank you , " said Nugent coolly . " I have . " " But it could n't be a woman , " cried Peter , looking a little stunned . " Remember , " said Nugent , " there 's only the name and the checks to go on . Women have managed to assume a man 's name before now . As to that , it has often struck me that Mrs. Brent and her brother could easily exchange identities . Especially considering the way she wears her hair . " There was another silence and then Peter said again in a rather stunned way , " Gosh , " and stared at Nugent as if he 'd pulled a rattlesnake out of his hat . And Craig said wearily , " But what of Drue , Lieutenant ? All the rest of this will take time . You may be on the right track and you may be on the wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past is n't known . " " I 've checked on everybody , " said Nugent . " Insofar as I could . But Frederic Miller could have had a quiet and infrequent existence in name only , so to speak , for some time . However , there 's another thing that has just come out ; nothing to do with the checks . The gloves that were found , one beside Chivery and the other in Anna 's room ,
