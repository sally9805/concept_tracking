Recent reports on Professor Bogomoletz ' ACS serum for improving tissue resistance and prolonging life ( TIME , Jan. 17 ) left many questions ( on dosage , duration of treatment , etc. ) unanswered . From Moscow last week came some of the answers : <P> &gt; Contrary to earlier reports , two tiny injections do not last a lifetime . Treatment is a ten-day course of injections which may be repeated as needed for resisting disease or restoring vigor ( e.g. , a certain cancer patient gets three courses a year ) . The course : three tiny injections every three days until twelve have been given . <P> &gt; ACS has not yet been used much on children , because their tissue resistance is naturally high . But it helps a scarlet fever case if given before the patient has been ill three days . Professor Bogomoletz thinks it might be used to stimulate growth in underdeveloped children . <P> &gt; Controlled experiments on wounded soldiers show that , with ACS treatment , a wound which would ordinarily take as long as six months to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for serum experiments is the rabbit . Serum for the purpose is made by inoculating rams with rabbit spleen and marrow cells , making an extract from their blood .
