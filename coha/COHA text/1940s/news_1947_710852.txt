txt Continuation the upward spiral of French prices is evoking signs of increased labor dissatisfaction with the result of new difficulties for Premier Paul Ramadier . President Vincent Auriol has just told heads of the Chambers of Commerce of the French Union : " Only one problem confronts us ? prices of foodstuffs , that is to say , prices of commodities required for daily life . This problem must be solved and we will solve it if only , turning away from sterile quarrels and criticism , we make the necessary effort of discipline , and if certain categories of producers and a too large number of middlemen finally realize that their selfishness and blindness are leading them to disaster . " Nine-Point Prices during October alone went up nine points , or 6 per cent . This makes a total rise of 50. per cent since last January . Wages have not kept pace with this increase , as usual . There was one main increase of 11 per cent given to all private industry , except for certain small shops , Civil servants did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piecemeal , in general , but on the most generous basis , wages can not be said to have gone up over 25 per cent since January , to meet the cost of living increase of 50 per cent during the same period . To withstand a situation of this kind , any regime needs strong backing . The fact that M. Ramadier 's vote of confidence  --  after the heavy right swing in the recent municipal elections  --  totaled only 20 votes evidences the precarious edge on which the present government is balancing . New Challenge . M. Ramadier 's reprieve will meet its next challenge on November 13 , when Parliament reconvenes . The Communist-controlled General Confederation of Labor ( CGT ) is asking for a general stopgap increase of 20 per cent , while the question is being threshed out , plus speedy increase of minimum wages from 7,000 to 10,500 francs monthly , While the large strike situation is for the moment dissipated , these pressures promise . very heavy strike weather unless demands are met . Thus garbage collectors now are on strike and are handing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salaries on which they must exist . They are using the always effective method of hours of work against cost of goods . Thus they show that on their pay basis , three eggs costs two hours of labor , a quart of cooking oil a half-day 's work , two pounds of beef one and three-quarters day 's labor , and a very ordinary worker 's suit of ready-made clothes one month 's work . I Milk Scarce Meanwhile , there is a very serious situation for children in the milk shortage . Children over four are fortunate to get a quarter of a pint of milk weekly . The summer drought combined with the farmers ' distrust of political conditions has cut the city 's supply to a mere trickle , and no butter ration is even announced for November . Butter is hard to find even on the black market and the price then is $5 a pound . Prices always show some seasonal increase at this time of the year . This year they will be in the nature of disaster for most housewives .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
