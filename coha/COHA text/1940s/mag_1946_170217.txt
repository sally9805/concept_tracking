On a rainy night in 1941 , a young Presbyterian minister and his dark-haired bride arrived at their first parish . Scotts Run , near Morgantown , West Va. , was a drab example of a drab species-the coalmining community . In its unpainted houses set among barren yards lived 5,000 mine folk . But Scotts Run was just where the Reverend Richard Charles Smith wanted to live . <P> Son of a Standard Oil tax specialist and educated at Michigan 's Hope College and Princeton Theological Seminary , thin-faced Pastor Smith had planned to work among miners . When the Presbyterian Board of National Missions offered him the Scotts Run post , he jumped at it . He took up residence in the " Shack , " a long , narrow , white and green building sandwiched between the railroad tracks and State Highway 7 . <P> The Shack was Pastor Smith 's home and headquarters . It was also the symbol of his special kind of ministry . Its 24 rooms included an auditorium and a kitchen for community parties . Smith added a steeple and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For five years Dick Smith and his wife have made their practical church hum with social and spiritual activity . Here he has held his Sunday services and conducted his Sunday-school classes ; here he has directed public school religious instruction , vacation Bible schools , a 15-minute Sunday night radio program over Morgantown 's station WAJR . The Smiths established a 3,500-volume library in the Shack ( Mrs. Roosevelt and the late President sent some books ) . Scotts Run small fry and bobby-soxers use the Shack for archery , croquet , ping-pong , dances ( " We 've got a juke box , " boasts Smith , " and we 're not ashamed to admit it . " ) . Of the Shack 's pool table he says : " It puts us one up on the nearest beer hall . " Smith 's explanation of his work : " When Christ was on earth He made the blind to see , the lame to walk . We , too , believe in ministering to the people 's everyday wants in order to fulfill their spiritual needs . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrial chaplain . " From the beginning , he and his wife have lived with and served their flock on the industrial front lines-going down into the mines , attending union meetings , helping conduct mine foremen 's classes . <P> Achievements at Scotts Run have not gone unrecognized . This year , the West Virginia Junior Chamber of Commerce selected Dick Smith for a Distinguished Service Award . His church has recently promoted him to be a supervisor of mountaineer mining missions , and he has moved into Morgantown with two ordained assistants and a third on the way . Both owners and miners are so appreciative of Smith 's work that they have asked the Presbyterian Board of National Missions to open nine more centers like the Shack . <P> Last week saw the completion of one of his most cherished projects , the Miners ' Memorial Pool to provide free summer swimming and winter skating for Scotts Run . Assembled for the dedication were representatives of the Chamber of Commerce , the A.F.L. , the C.I.O. , the U.M.W , as well as a mine operator , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Said Pastor Smith that day : " If these activities are n't working Christianity , I do n't know what is !
