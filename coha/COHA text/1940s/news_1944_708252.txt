txt Something has happened in the German High Command and it is not to our interests either . Whatever may be the truth or falsity of the current rumors that Adolf Hitler is dead , admittedly crazy or under detention , it now appears certain that he no longer is running the German Army . This is the considered opinion of a high American Army officer who has been studying the conduct of the German Army at first hand since D-day . In everything it does now the German Army shows the touch of the professional soldier instead of the hysterical egomaniac . " A highly professional touch is evident now instead of the errati- cism that characterized Hitler 's conduct of the Army earlier , " said a senior staff officer today . " If Hitler were running the army now , he probably would be screaming to his generals to retake Aachen by 6 o'clock tonight , instead of allowing them to conduct the highly skilled defense they are making now . If Flimmler has replaced Hitler as master of Germany , he at least has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It may well be that Field Marshal Gen. Kurt von Rundstedt now is in full command and not merely a nominal chieftain . The use the Germans have made of the past two months to recover , and their remarkable resurgence of military power , show no amateur now is in charge , but shrewd professional soldiers . And the Germans are dealing with the crisis confronting their army at Strasbourg in a highly skilled manner . " This officer thinks the attempt to bomb Hitler last July may have had something to do with the change in Army management . It was after that that the German Army pulled itself together , after its disastrous failures to stop or control our landings . Withdrawals Scientific Its counter-attack through Mortain , aimed at Avranches , was correctly conceived and ably attempted . It failed , but only narrowly , and was the one measure that could have seriously threatened us . That attack certainly was the work of a professional soldier . And so was the withdrawal of the German armies from France and Belgium . The expulsion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ever engulfed a military force but , despite our demoralizing armored thrusts accompanied by our ' , terrible punishment from the air that often blinded the Germans by disrupting their communications , that withdrawal was conducted with great professional skill . The Germans got a considerable part of their Army back within their own borders , where our men must fight it again . Anyone who sees the day-byday , stubborn and highly-skilled opposition that the Germans are presenting to our every movement on this front , equally is forced to the conclusion that the new direction took hold some time atfer Dday . The Germans have organized one defensive line after another after we breached the Siegfried Line and , though here and there our men push forward , we are having to pay a price in men and time . With their manpower admittedly low , also , now the Germans are showing adroitness in improvising ersatz troops , stiffened with veterans and breaking in new formations on the quieter sectors of our front . There is no trace of hysteria in anything they do now , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terrific Losses Offset The success with which the Germans have stalemated so many of our thrusts is even more noteworthy in the light of the losses we have inflicted on them . The United States First Army alone has captured 7,606 prisoners of war since Nov. 16 , when the present drive started . The American Ninth Army has captured about 8,000 in the same period . The Third Army has captured 17,000 . That wipes out the equivalent of five German Divisions by American forces , in addition to those ' killed and wounded , who probably are two or three times the number captured . And in this drive four German divisions have been destroyed by the United States First Army alone and two others so badly battered that they have been withdrawn for replacements and reorganization . Yet the Germans fight on with a doggedness and sometimes a brilliance that makes foolish earlier hopes that it would be a quick , easy victory once we got through the Siegfried Line . For us the war in Europe has just now reached its hardest phase .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
