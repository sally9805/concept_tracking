Monday through Friday , David Lene-man paints silk ties and blouses . His shimmering cravat art-fauns , peonies , moons , banjos-is strictly for cash . But on weekends he goes out to the garage back of his Hollywood house and paints for fun , in the most enjoyable way he knows . <P> Leneman 's Sunday art , which went on exhibition in a Los Angeles gallery last week , is as rich , sweet and indigestible as a double fudge sundae with caramel sauce . His cakey circus clowns , blobbed Bible scenes and dripping bouquets made many gallerygoers smile . But fellow artists were impressed . " How , " they kept asking , " does he get his effects ? " <P> Those who had watched Leneman at work could report that , whether or not he quite achieved his ends , his means and his theories were disarming . Leneman paints with his fingers , an activity he took up in Warsaw , at 14 . Leneman 's parents had taken away his brushes to make the boy spend more time at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So Leneman started smearing his inspirations directly on the canvas ; daubing , lumping , clutching , rubbing and pinching to heighten the drama . Then , in Palestine and Paris , he brought finger-painting to a fine pitch . Later he taught art in Venezuela and U.S. Army hospitals . <P> Now a bouncy , talkatively intense 40 , Leneman is proud of being a family man ( three children ) as well as an artist . Explaining that he scratches thin lines with his fingernails , he adds , with a wistful look at his chubby hands , that his nails used to be longer " but I always scratched my wife and she made me cut them . " <P> Leneman reasons that brushes are merely extensions of the fingers ; he prefers to do without them because finger-painting gives him " a much closer physical relationship . I like directness , I 'm impatient , and a good painting is a good painting even if it 's done with the nose . " <P> Leneman paints with emotional haste and seldom spends more than a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says . " My paintings play and sing and dance . " Critics were not inclined to go that far , but they did generally agree that the paintings have a creamy , baroque sweetness all their own . Even if it adds up to little more than a sticky hobby , Leneman 's art works wonders with a method otherwise usually used to keep kids busy on rainy afternoons .
