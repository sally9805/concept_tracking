In the fuzzy world of Japan 's new democracy it seemed like a Shinto nightmare . Two thousand hard-jawed Japanese , in jackboots and military khaki , clomped down the gangplank of the transport that had brought them from prison camps in Siberia to their home in Dai Nippon . They clenched fists , bawled the Internationale and the Song of the Kolkhoz . <P> Many a shocked compatriot on shore remembered how these men had sailed away , in the days of the Co-Prosperity Sphere , with a similar purposeful spirit and disciplined jingoist chants . The official welcoming party-talkative bureaucrats , beaming Red Cross nurses , bustling newsmen-waited on a bare wooden dock in Maizuru harbor , with blue , cloud-flecked hills and stark rusted cranes of the former naval base as backdrop . The 2,000 lined up rigidly , listened stonily to the effusive greetings , responded with chilling precision . A close-cropped ex-army captain stepped stiffly forward . " Some of us , " he barked , " have not seen home in ten years . All of us have been prisoners for four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2,000 chorused : " Sono tori exactly ! " The captain barked : " Full of hope , we have come to build a new democratic Japan on the Potsdam agreement . " The men thundered : " Yoshi good ! " <P> Members of the welcoming committee exchanged worried glances . These were not soft , war-sick homecomers but hard , aggressive strangers .

What had happened to them was anybody 's guess . <P> The 2,000 spoke about their captivity in various ways . " The Russian treatment was on the whole good , " some would say with jerky glances over their shoulders . " I say join the Communists in Japan , but I want to wait and see what conditions are really like first . " At times , when one of the dyed-in-the-wool Communists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The men who led the lusty singing and shouted the stiff commands were more positive in their views . Artilleryman Sei-saku Akimoto , leader of the Russian-sponsored Minshu Ka Undo ( Democratic Movement ) in his camp , said : " The Russians trust us and we trust the Russians . We soon found out from our newspapers there how we had been duped by fascists and capitalists . " Snapped former Pfc . Tsugio Kishimoto , prison company commander : " We must all join the Communist Party . It is our only chance to build a new , democratic Japan . " <P> " I Never Had It So Good . " The school in Siberia which had inculcated such thoughts and sentiments had begun bitterly . For two years the men were cold and hungry , worked unremittingly . Then the Russians eased up . For those who embraced Communism or at least paid lip service , living conditions took a sharp turn for the better . Recalled one repatriate : " I never had it so good . There was plenty to eat and the Russians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
