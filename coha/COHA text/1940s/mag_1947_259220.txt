The new reasonableness of labor was tested for the first time last week . In Pittsburgh , C.I.O. President Phil Murray , who is also head of the United Steelworkers , agreed to extend the steelworkers ' present contract with U.S. Steel Corp . from Feb. 15 to April 30 . With any threat of a steel strike postponed , Congress was less likely to rush restrictive labor laws . Meantime , also , management might find where it stood in the " portal-to-portal " pay controversy ( see BUSINESS ) . The same day , the United Auto Workers ' Walter Reuther made a similar 30-day deal with Chrysler . <P> It looked as if the C.I.O. 's biggest unions were going to be very reasonable indeed . There was a second advantage in this for Murray . By pushing ahead the contract date-and the possible strike deadline-he would be sitting idly on the sidelines when John L. Lewis comes up for his bout with the Government and the coal operators on April 1 .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
