AYBE you remember the depression winter of 1932 . Things were mostly grim all over , but there were some sprightly touches at . Lake Placid , in the Adirondack Mountains of New York . Here the Winter Olympics came to the United States for the first time , and with it came big-time bobsled racing , a spectacularly breakneck affair . There was the precipitous bobsled run down Mt . Van Hoevenberg , with its walls of ice banking up as much as twenty feet on the curves . There was the little Swiss , Reto Capadrutt ? he was killed in a race in 1937 ? who drove his sled like a horseman , steering with ropes instead of a wheel . There were the Germans who became ambulance cases when their sled shot off into the trees at Zig Zag curve , and the Germans who did the same thing at Shady Corner . And there was the home team , mostly green , but quick to learn , which wound up stealing the show . Scores of bobsledders have whipped down Mt . Van @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same World Series atmosphere . Next week , for the first time since the 1932 Olympics , bobsledders from many lands are due to ride at Lake Placid again . This is the 1949 World Bobsled Championship , duly authorized by the Federation Internationale de Bobsleigh , and scheduled to run from February second through the sixth . Teams have been invited from England , Switzerland , Belgium and France , from Canada , Norway , Italy and Germany . This includes the foreign stars of the 1948 Winter Olympics at St. Moritz ? drivers like Switzerland 's Felix Endrich and Fritz Feierabend , who placed first and second in the two-man race , and Belgium 's Max Houben , a veteran of the 1932 Olympics , who was still agile enough to finish second in the four-man event and fourth in the two-man in 1948 . Enough overheated slush has been written about bobsledding to flood a dozen bob runs . But when all the breathless exaggerations are stripped away , bobsled racing is still something special as a thrill sport . At Lake Placid they race a mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiating fourteen sudden twists and turns . There are brakes on the sled , but they are used only to stop it after it crosses the finish line . A racing bob is controlled by steering , and it is up to the man at the wheel to get it down in one piece . Stan Benham , a Lake Placid driver , whose team won all the major four-man races in this country last winter , was a top-notch ski jumper before he took up bobsledding . Ski jumping may sound like an even surer way of unhinging your vertebrae , but Benham says that onceyou get the knack , it 's fairly tame . " You do exactly the same thing in exactly the same way every time . In bobsledding , it 's one thing after another . Those curves come up so fast you have to keep thinking a couple of moves ahead to be ready for them . " Benham is a solid citizen , energetic and cheerful . American bobsledders do not run to a set pattern , any more than people in other fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious thing , they ( Continued on Page 87 ) either live in the Adirondack area or are in a position to spend a lot of time there , since the Hoevenberg slide is still the only full-fledged bob run in North America . For another thing , they are usually fellows who have been tinkering around since their teens with speed devices  --  motorcycles , or airplanes , or racing boats . They are mechanically minded ; the mechanical adjustment of a bobsled is a major factor in winning races . They are pretty levelheaded , as a rule  --  mere recklessness will get you nothing but a set of fractures . Bobsledders are mostly large  --  the average weight on our 1948 Olympic squad was 217 pounds . The more the men weigh  --  if they can handle their weight properly  --  the faster the sled goes . You begin to build up a picture of bobsledding as a sport exclusively for big strong men . However , this concept ion is shaken when you study the key men  --  the drivers . Some of the best ones have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you come to one past champion who is neither big nor strong nor a man  --  Miss Katharine Dewey . Miss Dewey is a brown-haired Lake Placid girl of medium height and build . Her grandfather was Melvil Dewey , founder of the vast Lake Placid Club and of the Dewey Decimal System , widely used for indexing files and reference material . Her father is Godfrey Dewey , the man most responsible for bringing the 1932 Winter Olympics to Lake Placid . Katharine began racing with her father at a tender age , then went on to drive her own sled . At this point Mrs. Dewey insisted that two bobsled drivers in one family was too much , and the father withdrew in favor of his daughter . Katharine did n't have much size , but she had nerve , co-ordination and a darned good sled . She took three years off for nurse 's training , then came back in 1940 to drive a four-man sled to victory in the National A.A.U. championship  --  the only woman entry in a field of men . This pill was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next winter Katharine was barred from racing . To be sure , it was n't put on a basis of " ca n't have a girl showing up the men . " Katharine was declared ineligible under an A.A.U. regulation which applies to all amateur sports , prohibiting men and women from competing in the same events . During the war Katharine was away as an Army nurse for four years , much of it overseas . Now she is back in Lake Placid , helping out at driving tourists down the run during the bobsled season . She concedes that the sport has its dangers , but says they can be avoided by proper driving . " If you 've been down those roller coasters at the amusement . parks , " she says , " you 've been down something much worse than this bobsled run . This is so much more scientifically engineered . " Meanwhile Katharine is still banned from the men 's races , and there are not enough wo* len for her to race against . She is philosophical about it all , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , few people have what it takes for championship bobsled driving . New talent develops slowly , advancing from novice to junior to senior races . Most of today 's standout drivers are in their thirties , and one or two are in their forties . Stan Benham , the winning driver in the North American and National A.A.U. four-man races in 1948 , is thirty-three . Jim Bickford , holder of several Hoevenbergcourse records , whose sled placed third in the Olympic four-man last year , is thirty-seven . Francis Tyler , whose sled placed first , does n't plan to race this year . He is forty-four . Joe Meconi , another good four-man pilot , is thirtyfive . Forty-eight-year-old Bill Pratt , who has been away from the sport for ten years , is a dark horse in the four-man division this year . So was thirty-four year-old Alexis Thompson , owner of professional football 's championship Philadelphia Eagles , who has had two nasty crackups in the past . In mid-December Thom pson had an emergency appendectomy which promised to sideline him once more . From these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked to ( amtist toed mo Pagd ? 89 ) ( Coss t I fr Page represent the United States in the world championships next week . This article went to press before the final tryouts had been held and the selections made . Similarly , two American teams will compete in the two-man race . Here the age level tends to he somewhat lower . The lighter two-man sleds  --  nine feet long , weighing about 350 pounds  --  are trickier . But the four-man sleds  --  twelve feet , 485 pounds  --  go faster . Drivers often start out in two-man racin7 , then switch to four-man . However , the leading two-man driving prospects are no callow youths : Fred Fortune , Jr. , twenty-seven , who finished third in the 1948 Olympics ; Tuffield A. ( Tully ) Latour , forty , who also drove at St. Moritz ; Dick Surplis , thirty , who cleaned up in the domestic two-man events last winter much as Stan Benham did in the four-man . Just how dangerous is bobsledding ? Some crack drivers will tell you there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once experiments were made in which a two-man sled was loaded with lead bars weighing as much as two average bobsledders and sent down the Hoevenberg run , letting gravity take its course . The sled got all tie way to the next-to-the-last curve before going off . There are men who have raced for years without ever so much as tipping over in the runway . There are others who have made several trips to the hospital . So far , no bobsledder has been killed at Lake Placid , but some have been badly smashed up . The risk is there every time a sled goes down the run . However , most bobsledders just do n't think about it . " If the time comes when you worry about having an accident , " they say , " that 's the time to quit . " One respected driver reached this point , acknowledged it very frankly and bowed out . Some men get the jitters and refuse to admit it , perhaps even to themselves . There was one well-publicized bobsledder who sometimes fainted dead away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is something like a professional golf tournament , in which everyone plays the same course and it takes better than par to win . They go down the run one at a time , racing the clock instead of other sleds . Each sled is timed for four separate heats , and the one with the lowest aggregate time wins . The difference between winners and losers is measured in seconds  --  sometimes in split seconds . From the middle of December , when the Mt . Van Hoevenberg run opens , until the end of the racing season in February , the bobsledders are out there day after day , endlessly sharpening their techniques . They practice starts over and over , and speed down the course again and again , trying to hit those curves not too high , not too low , but just right . If you make a bad move at one point , it will plague you for the rest of the run , for the turns follow one another too fast for you ever to get completely back on the beam . They never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best bowlers can throw strikes every time . Human co-ordination is n't that infallible . Then , too , the condition of the course changes from day to day , as thaw follows freeze . The drivers win the races , but not unless they have good men riding behind them . The four men on the sled  --  or the two  --  must synchronize like Radio City Rockettes . At the starting Point they take prescribed holds on the sled and begin rocking it back and forth , like boys preparing to toss somebody into a swimming pool . When everybody has the rhythm , the driver gives the signal and they let ' er rip . The driver slams into his seat and , one by one , the others slam on after him . The driver hunches down as low as possible over the wheel and the others hunch down even lower behind him , to keep wind resistance at a minimum . They get down so low , in fact , that all they can see is the seat of the sled . From practice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precise moment to lean for a curve , and which way to lean . If a man shifts his weight the wrong way , or fails to shift in unison with the others , the sled is in for trouble . The man at the rear is known as the brakeman , but if he ever used his brakes during a race his teammates would pitch him off the mountain . He does have to brake at the finish , however , or the sled would keep plowing on up into the woods . Another thing Americip bobsledders do n't do is bob . This almost extinct maneuver is what gave the original bobsleds their name . It consisted of the riders bobbing back and forth t o pick up speed on the straightaways . With today 's high-geared sleds , you are n't on the straightaways long enough to get in any significant bobbing . Even if you were , many bobsledders think , all that jerking around would more likely slow the sled than speed it up . For all its clocklike techniques , bobsled racing still contains a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad heat  --  and the race goes out the window . In the 1936 Winter Olympics at Garin ischPartenkirchen , in Germany , an Amer-jam four-man sled piloted by J. Hubert Stevens was the odds-on favorite . In the very first heat , however , a sled ahead of Stevens ' gouged out some big chunks of ice at one of the curves . The Germans patched it up , but imperfectly . The Stevens sled smacked right into the bad spot and capsized in the runway . The Americans never lost ' their handholds on the bob and ultimately righted it . Jim Bickford , who was riding brake , clung to the rear , his body dragging along the ice , until he finally got back on board . Observers estimated that the episode cost the American team fifteen seconds . In each of the next three heats , Stevens and company beat the course record . When the times for all four heats were added up , however , they were down in fourth place , about five seconds behind the winners . The United States is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definite impact on the sport . Bobsled racing had its crude beginnings at St. Moritz , Switzerland , shortly before the turn of the century . It spread from there to dozens of other European winter resorts . For a long time , however , the only Americans who got a crack at it were those who could study or vacation in Europe . As late as 1928 , when bobsledding was included for the second time in the winter Olympics , there were still no championship runs in the United States . However , there were a few speedthinded Americans on the Olympic scene in Switzerland , such as Billy Fiske , a New York banker 's son , who later joined the RAF before Pearl Harbor and died in aerial combat . Billy organized an American four-man team and got permission to represent the United States . Everyone thought this was just a nice gesture  --  until Billy and his boys walked off with first prize . And an American named Jack Heaton won the other Olympic bobsled event  --  the one-man race . Last year Jack finished second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special kind of run . There have been none in this country , but Alexis Thompson had one under construction this fall at Saranac Lake , ten miles from Lake Placid . It may go into partial operation this winter . The 1932 Olympics were awarded to Lake Placid on condition that all the necessary facilities be constructed , including a first-class bobsled run . A foreign specialist , Stanislaus Zentzytzki , was imported to design the bob run . On Mt . Van Hoevenberg , eight miles on the outskirts of Lake Placid , he mapped a steep mile-and-a-half course , with grades varying from a minimum of 8% to a maximum of 15 per cent . The course was shortened to a mile in 1936 , chiefly to reduce maintenance expenses , and there have been minor modifications since . Zentzytzki had laid out the Schreiberhau run in Germany and other famous European slides before coming here , but for Hoevenberg he doped out some new wrinkles . On most European courses , the straightaways are much steeper than the curves ; at Hoevenberg , the curves are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channels , of earth construction , six and a half feet wide . The towering curves , which arch up almost at right angles , are built of stone . For racing , the course is laboriously covered with special mixtures of snow and water . The curves become sheer ice ; on the straightaways , a thin frosting of snow is applied to give the sled runners more traction . The Hoevenberg run went into operation in the winter of 1930-31 , giving American bobsledders a season of advance practice for the Olympics . There were a few veterans of 1928 , like Billy Fiske , but most of the candidates were brand-new to the game . Nonetheless , the United States again carried off both the Olympic bobsled races . Billy Fiske 's team repeated in the four-man class . The other event , a two-man race , was won by sons of a Lake Placid hotel man  --  J. Hubert and Curtis Stevens . Bobsledding in Europe has been considered a rich man 's sport , but this is not true in the United States . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do have to have occupations or employers elastic enough to let them get in the necessary practice . Several bobsledders are tavern proprietors , such as Tufty Latour in Saranac Lake and Joe Meconi in Ausrible Forks . Jim Bickford is caretaker of a lodge . Freddy Fortune is a plumber . Stan Benham is assistant to H. L. Garren , manager of the North Elba Park District , which oversees many of the local winter-sport facilities . Almost all the top hands are married , and most have children . The wives are generally less than enthusiastic about their husbands ' participation in the sport . Some wives come out to the races , their upper lips stiff , but a majority elect to stay home . Once Atari Benham , who has never had an accident , persuaded his wife to go with him on a racing day . The idea was that she would watch him do his stuff , seeing how safe it really was , and then take a ride down herself , as hmidreds of visitors do on state-operated sleds each winter . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the halfway point to give the lady her ride . She was n't in sight . He finally found her in the clubhouse . It developed that after one look at her husband coming around Shady Corner , a horseshoe turn where the sleds whip around almost at the top of a huge wall , she did n't even want to watch any more . The next week the Benhams tried again . " When I could n't find her up there after the race , " Stan says , " I knew just where to look . There she was in the clubhouse , huddled over a cup of coffee . " Mrs. Benham has n't been out to the bob run since . Bobsleds cost $500 and up  --  way up . No racing man is satisfied with his sled as is when it comes out of the factory . Each racer works over his bob interminably , making little alterations designed to step up its speed . Racing sleds must meet certain specifications in weight and in gauge of runners . But there is still leeway for things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock , " so that only a few inches will actually be in contact with the ice . Sometimes a man will come up with a really basic change which shaves whole seconds off racing time . One such development was the replacement of the old rodlike runners with the present metal plates . Next week at Lake Placid , after their final practice runs , the bobsledders will slave away for hours making final adjustments on their sleds . The steering mechanism must be just so . The front axle must have the right amount of looseness , to give the runners a sort of " knee action " on the turns . The runners will be gone over for imperfections , and any nicks filed down . Then the whole surface of each runner will be polished smooth with emery cloth , until a man 's arm is ready to drop oft On the day of a race everybody is up at dawn . The best bobsledding time is the early morning , before the sun has a chance to thaw out the course . Even then , heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shield the ice from the sun . But it is cold . At Lake Placid they have raced at temperatures as low as twelve below zero . The men wear long woolen underwear under their ski-type pants , and a couple of sweaters under their windbreaker jackets . Their heads are protected by plastic football helmets . The favorite footwear is a leather shoe with rubber-grip soles . The bobsleds are kept on racks in a building at the bottom of the run . When a team 's number is called , its sled is hauled out by a system of overhead pulleys to a waiting truck , which ferries sled and riders up to the top of the course . Everyone is a bit edgy . When they ease the sled onto the truck , and again when they ease it off , the men are apt to glare mistrustfully at one another , fearful of some knock which will jolt the bob out of alignment . Bobsledders follow no strict training rules , but a man does well to watch what he eats and drinks before a race . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if a man 's stomach is off , his reflexes are apt to he off too . Along the course , crowds collect to watch the bobs come down . The three best spots are the finish line , ? Shady Corner and Zig Zag . The latter two are the most dangerous points on the run . Shady is a giant horseshoe curve ; Zig Zag is an s turn where you come off one sharp curve smack into another . As each sled crosses the starting line , an electric eye sets off an automatic timing mechanism . When the sled crosses the finish line , another electric eye snaps the timer off . Times are measured to the hundredth of a second . A sled can not start down the run until the one ahead of it has finished . There are telephone booths at strategic points along the course . As a sled passes each booth , announcements are made to the crowds over a public-address system . Down in the sled house , bobsledders waiting their turns hear the announcements too . Some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heat gets under way , they forget about cards . They listen tensely to hear what time will be made , calculating what they will have to do to beat it . Once in a great while the announcements of a sled 's progress abruptly cease , and blaring phonograph music comes on . There has been an accident . If this is disconcerting to the other contestants , few of them show it . They seem to keep on believing , " It wo n't happen to me . " There may be a delay of a few minutes while the wreckage is cleared away , but the show goes on . How fast do they go ? In 1947 , engineers from one of the big electrical-manufacturing companies rigged up some intricate paraphernalia near the finish line and undertook to answer this question . By their computations , the big four-man sleds were hitting speeds up to 119.5 miles an hour ; the smaller two-man bobs , 89 miles an hour . Some bobsledders are happy to accept these figures as gospel . Others dismiss them with contemptuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is much more than sixty miles an hour . The only thing which can be determined with assurance is the average speed of a sled during a run . The record for the one-mile course is one minute , five and a quarter seconds , made by Bill Linney 's four-man team in 1946 . This averages out to approximately fifty-five miles an hour . But all this is pretty academic . When you 're tearing along on a racing bob just a few inches off the ice , without benefit of an enclosed cockpit or all-metal body , you do n't need a speedometer to tell you what 's happening . Brother , you 're going like a bat out of hell .
