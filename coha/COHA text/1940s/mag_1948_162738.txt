Three months ago , earnest , angular Editor Ben McKelway of the Washington Star called one of his reporters on the carpet . To 29-year-old Tom G. Buchanan Jr. , who covered the medical beat , the boss put one question : Are you a Communist ? Reporter Buchanan , an ex-Army captain , replied that he was ( an admission that most good Communists regard as naive ) . McKelway carefully assured Buchanan that his work had been satisfactory . Then he fired him . <P> By being so honest with each other McKelway and Buchanan raised a clear-cut issue that had the C.I.O. American Newspaper Guild in a dither of soul-searching last week .

" <P> Said jobless Tom Buchanan : " To Mrs. Roosevelt and to all whose advice has been , ' stand up and be counted , ' I now reply that I am on my feet . It is time for them to stand up and be counted , too . " When Washington Guildsmen stood up last week , the preliminary count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communist Buchanan .
