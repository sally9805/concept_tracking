Air-force transport formations supplied advanced German units-German communique , Dec. 30 . <P> Eleven transport planes were brought down in the Stalingrad area-Russian communique , Dec. 30 . <P> Terse , official statements like these last week highlighted a vital phase of the war in Russia . For the Russian front was now , in many respects , similar to the Pacific front : the Germans were pocketed on a series of " islands , " where the beleaguered armies could survive only so long as they were supplied from centers many miles away . As rail and road routes fell to the Russians and advance depots were depleted , the Germans had to depend more &; more on supply by air . <P> Junkers v. Stormoviks . Neither their plight nor their task was new to the Germans . The Luftwaffe built up its fleets of three-engined Junkers 52 transports before the war , and ever since the invasion of Poland the air supply of field armies has been routine . <P> Early in the Russian campaign they demonstrated that they could fly in replacements , guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German groups survived last winter largely because of efficient Luftwaffe supply ; officers " surrounded " near Staraya Russa took leave in Berlin , returned to their troops when the encircling Russian lines were still unbroken . <P> But the Russians also learned . They kept air patrols along the principal German supply routes , harried the Junkers with fighters and Stormovik assault planes , sought out and incessantly bombed the fields where the German transports landed . Where the German routes crossed Red Army territory , the Russians lined the way with hidden ack-ack batteries . Sometimes guerrilla ack-ack units planted batteries behind the German lines . German pilots flew through snowstorms to outwit the Russian hunters . The Luftwaffe constantly changed its routes , began to dispatch transports singly or in small groups rather than in large formations . <P> Describing this intricate contest in a recent issue of Britain 's weekly Aeroplane , the Red Air Force 's Major General Kondratov said that in six months of 1942 the Russians destroyed 600 Junkers 528 in the air and on the ground . Wrote General Kondratov : " Along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wane and then vanish when transport airplanes ceased to arrive . " <P> How Many Junkers ? The Luftwaffe was reported to have at least five thousand 528 and other transport planes at the war 's start . But the Balkan campaign , Crete and the trans-Mediterranean supply of Rommel must have absorbed a big proportion of the available transports . The Germans in Tunisia now require many more for their prodigious air-supply operation via Sicily ( see p. 25 ) . <P> With the need , the rate of loss in Russia has also risen . Early in the campaign to relieve Stalingrad the Russians concentrated on the Luftwaffe transports ; Moscow claimed the destruction of 46 in one day , 60 in another , 225 in seven days . The Germans apparently still had advanced airdromes for most of their armies , still had transports . Upon the Russians ' ability to destroy these airlines to the German islands , victory might swing .
