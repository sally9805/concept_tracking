Meat ceilings returned to the U.S. last week-and meat itself went out the window . <P> OPA put up a tough front , sent out some 2,500 agents to try once more to hold its price line against the black market . In New York City , where about two out of every three butcher shops closed , some black marketeers showed utter contempt for OPA 's toughness . They bluntly told OPA agents to scram . <P> Even if OPA 's flurry of crackdown activity succeeded beyond its hopes , the results would be hardly noticeable on U.S. tables . The meat shortage was virtually a famine , and it would not soon get better . Shipments of livestock to slaughtering centers had dried up ; many slaughterers closed up shop indefinitely , along with thousands of butchers . In a week in which it would normally purchase and process 9,000 cattle and 26,000 hogs , Armour &; Co. ' s main plant in Chicago took in only 68 cattle , 139 hogs . <P> " Dismal Failure . " Where was the meat ? A great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period when farmers had sent to market just about every animal that could walk or crawl . Much of that meat had been eaten , but doubtless large quantities of it had been stored by buyers who foresaw the return of ceilings and shortages . The meat which was still out in the nation 's pastures on the hoof was likely to stay there for many weeks . <P> Meat industry experts could sight no appreciable easing of the shortage before the year 's end . OPA Boss Paul Porter tried to whistle up some cheer , but his best was a prediction that supplies would be " fairly good " after six or eight weeks . If not , Administration Democrats did not like to think about the effects on the November elections . <P> In its week of desperation OPA also got some bad publicity . In Los Angeles one of its raiding agents made the mistake of getting his picture taken while threatening an auto salesman with a " slapper " ( see BUSINESS ) . The incident brought a somewhat shamefaced confirmation from OPA that several hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food ) are now authorized to carry arms .
