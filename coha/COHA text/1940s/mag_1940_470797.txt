INQUIRE into the origin of the im1 pulse that made more American parents beget children in the year 1920 than had ever begotten children before might take us far afield . The War was over . Our boys were home . We were experiencing an exalted prosperity . Prohibition had not yet destroyed our stomachs , yet the experiment was new and men still stayed home from the saloons . There was also among us a large number of the foreign-born in the begetting age . The future of the world was assured . Aggression was crushed forever . Throughout all Europe , as well as all the Americas , 1920 was a year of carefree generation . These children were born in a time of depression . After a bad period of pampering they ran into another depression when they were nine or ten years old . They have passed their adolescence in a disillusioned and a baffled world , when all the old gags are still being mouthed and imposed on the young , though few believe them . Now these young people emerge into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , or service ever absorbed in a single year in our nation 's history . These boys and girls , now sixteen to twenty-three , are not just a part of what we call by custom the younger generation . They are something else ; they are also the largest generation . They represent an anomaly , the result of a freakish combination of the complicated laws of causality . As long as they live their position will be a little different fromthat of any other age-group . There will be more of their particular kind , in proportion to the whole of us , than is reasonable or convenient for them , or for anybody else . What is to happen to these young men and women ? Their problem is part of the general problem of employment , nearly all discussions of which start at the wrong end of the stick ? at the historic causes , and not with the present fact . History is in the past and we can do very little about it but deplore it , or be proud . Nor can time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it so . The living present is the beginning of every constructive enterprise . These millions of young people are an important part of the living present . Most of them are being graduated now into that division of our population called the lowest income group , and until lately called the very poor . They will not like to be classed with that group , but that is where they belong , economically speaking ? in that segment whose median income , married or single , is less than eight hundred dollars a year . One can not think about the nature of unemployment , or of poverty , without understanding what the position of the lowest third of our people really means . And I think it is also vital for our young men and women to realize what their position in that group really means . The basic fact can be stated very simply . in a great industrial civilization , capable of producing a surplus of all material things , one-third of our people , and perhaps much more then one-third , are not producing anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody else definitely needs them to do . Consequently they have no exchange with which to buy what they want for themselves . Let us consider the essence of this problem . If a man wants a chair for men are so foolish ? he must do something or produce something that is wanted by someone else , or by everyone else , until a chair is somehow loosened from its owner and comes into his possession . Granted that the rules of the game are not very sporting , that still remains the fact under any rules whatever . Now suppose the chair-desirer were I ( which he is not ) and suppose that , wanting the chair , I should sit down on the grass and produce with great anguish ( or ecstasy ) an inferior sonnet . Would that get me the chair ? I think not . It might on a bet , but the odds would be very heavy against it . Yet I should have labored and suffered and bitten my nails , it may be , for many more hours than did anyone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked me to write that sonnet . It was a volunteer effort altogether . Moreover , I should be less than a fool if / did not know that the market for such a product is perpetually dull except perhaps among charming ladies with large eyes , who are all too rarely charming ladies with unoccupied chairs . So at the end of the day 's or month 's work I should still have the sonnet , and the chair owner still have his chair , and where is the justice in that ? In nature , or rather a little deeper , in the nature of reality . It is conventional to assume that poets are capable of the sort of folly which I have described , if it be folly . But the matter is very serious when millions of people act , or are compelled to act , in much the way I have described . A sharecropper is a human being with normal human wants , but no one askshim to do what he is doing . He is merely permitted to farm a patch of weedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he has poor training or equipment , and produces almost nothing that anybody really wants . Hard as he works , his labor has little or no exchange value . So he lives on the edge of starvation all the time . There in simple outline lies the problem of our industrial world and of the hordes of young men and women corning this year to a need for self-support : there are millions of people in the United States to-day who are willing to work and in fact are working hard , but at things that nobody gives a hang whether they work at or not . There is the nut which must be cracked . Look at it closely II and then cast a quick glance at our present theories as to what will crack the nut , and you will see that they do not touch the problem at all , as we should already know from practical experience , for they have not done so . They are all based on the absurd theory that we are still in a Depression , and that to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unemployment and remove poverty . They follow certain eminent Cabinet members in contending that all our country needs for everything to be well is Recovery . But we have Recovery . We have been having normal , and indeed on the basis of the past twenty years , above-normal business . We had , in fact , an extraordinary Recovery in both 1937 and 1939 . The eminent gentlemen mean that we need a boom , like that of 1929 , an entirely drunken year whose extravagance was purchased with the lifetime savings of most of our citizens . Yet in that year , to which we now look back across a decade or more as normal ( like a child remembering Christmas morning as the way every day ought to be ) , there was widespread unemployment and widespread poverty . Twenty-five per cent of all Union members in the building trades were unemployed , seven per cent in the metal trades , and twelve per cent in all trades , which is only one per cent better than the employment among Union labor in 1937 . You may think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are unquestionably millions more unemployed now than in 1929 . I am merely contending that Recovery , even to the level of that riotous era of over-financing and over-production , could not solve our present problem . For though many are now unemployed , or in need , because of technical improvements and the decline of foreign trade , there are millions of others unemployed for reasons that have nothing much primarily to do with economies ? that is , there are millions more in the employable age now than in 1929 , and the employable class also forms a higher percentage of our population now than ever in the past . Some contend that foreign commerce will eventually see us out of this difficulty , but they are wrong . It has been held , for instance , that the modernization of China would give employment to millions of American workers . But for what money or return ? We need tungsten and tung-oil from China , but that is all . We can not pay a million American workers in lychee nuts or lacquer boxes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can receive without taking work from American men . This problem is not to be solved by postponing its solution nor by taking in wider territories than our own . Some hold that what we need is a new industry . But automobile manufacture is , relatively speaking , a new industry . Moreover , besides its own growth it has produced immense parallel growths in petroleum refining , in highway construction , and in the restaurant business , and is still providing collateral employment to an extent paralleled only in the early history of the railroads . There is nothing in sight that is not picayune in corn-parison with this vast automotive upheaval , still going on . Yet , during its progress , we have had unparalleled unemployment . The radio has left us with widespread unemployment and it is on the height of its popularity . The moving picture , and the organic chemistry of the plastics have not done any permanent good for the employment of a great mass of the people of our land . If the new-industry effect were real it would be working now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advances in manufacturing have about balanced our increased use of new inventions . Nylon seems to be a discovery of far-reaching usefulness and to be ushering in a new industry of great importance . It may stimulate the knitting industry , but it will inevitably hurt our markets in Japan and China , and a large part of its activities will be substitute activities competitive with the present silk and rayon industries , or in various ways replacing their products . The invention is a gain , but in no large way a gain in employment . For fifty years we have been increasing the variety of our food consumption and we have to-day a more complex and adequate diet than ever before in our national history . Yet the number of our farms and the number of our farmers has steadily declined , not only proportionately , but absolutely . The whole succession of new agricultural industries , when balanced against technological advances in production , have resulted merely in declining work for men on farms . The truth seems to be that we do not need more land in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all available present evidence we do not want more people . Efforts to shorten working hours still further , so that the manufacturing industries can absorb a larger number of workers , are now necessary , wherever they can be applied . But to believe that such expedients will solve our problems is merely to chase a will-o ' - the- wisp . Shorter hours may to some extent compensate for the growth of technological unemployment . But the plan is wrong in principle . To hold that it is excessive for a man to work one-third of a day or one-third of a lifetime is to hold that activity for personal advantage is bad for man . Five thousand years of human experience lead to an opposite conclusion . Human nature is not adapted to unlimited leisure . To have sixteen or seventeen hours a day to spend as one chooses is a good enough fate so long as man inherits the physique of his neolithic ancestors . To retire all men at sixty into enforced idleness , just when many of them are reaching the prime of their powers , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong in principle . It is a product of industrial astigmatism ? that bias in our mental processes which has led us to believe that the machine is the only god which human effort can properly serve and that idleness is life 's ultimate blessing . The benefits of the machine are no illusion . But the curse on human living to-day is our inability to perceive , before frightful consequences ensue , that machinery is perfectly adapted to the production of human necessities and for the ground work of living ? but that living itself has to stand clear of machinery or our industrial civilization will fail to bring happiness to men . If we are all to be happy all men should work , young and old alike , and all women , so long as they are able . Any other ideal is mere moonshine for people of flesh and blood . But to move on from that certainty to the conclusion that our success as a nation depends on unlimited factory work , on the unending multiplication of mechanical products , with a consequent endless struggle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiving in return wealth of some unnameable and mystical sort which will not compete with our practically universal variety of production , is not moonshine or sunshine but only the brewing of a devastating storm . If we follow that path we are lost . Europe isnow illustrating its reductio ad absurdum . Mr. Roosevelt 's ideal of free trade as the cure for the world 's ills reveals no hint of insight into the fact that , under the competitive conditions of modern industrialism , foreign trade is a constant and unremitting war ? that our peaceful most-favored-nation sale of oil and metals to Russia was war on Finland and that our enormous exports of steel to Japan have been , for three years , nothing else but a war on China . This year , in Europe , the world 's greatest production of young men of all time that ever was is being sent to death . But war also can not solve this problem for anybody , however widespread its destruction . It creates no values . Those who are dying are the energetic and the producers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-morrow will have to ask in vain . Merely to state the obvious fact that a large number of our people are not creating values is not explaining how this comes about . But the " how " can , in this case , be put briefly . First , laborsaving machinery actually does save labor . Second , durable goods are actually durable goods . These two facts , instead of being calamities as we now hold them to be , are the very greatest triumphs of our civilization . Yet they have become calamities because we have refused to accept them as being real . We are against them in principle . We believe that although a motor car has eight years of usable life , that fact should be hidden as one of the most shameful secrets of nature . That any modern product is durable is rarely mentioned among its merits . To call attention to such a property would be , it appears , high treason against the spirit of the times , embodied in to-morrow 's models . It is the one thing we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one thing that is truly important if unemployment is ever to be solved . For to these two facts ? that labor-saving machines do save labor , and that durable goods as well as many consumer goods are durable ? is to be added one more factor of immense significance . In production , coal , oil , and sunlight are our vital partners . But coal , oil , and sunlight are not consumers . They do not eat breakfast-food , wear changeable clothes , use lipstick , or need amusement . Yet they are immensely more powerful as producers than is man . Consequently , the present partnership and balance of production and consumption is too uneven for human capacity to compensate for , if all of us try to live on values created only by production . What the natural-energy sources contribute to material production has to be compensated for , and compensated for increasingly , by values created outside of their province altogether . And the more we save labor by the use of non-consuming energy sources ? whether the sun , through scientific agriculture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steam engines ? the more must people inevitably become producers of other than power-created values , or industrialism will not work . The adjustment to that condition is the one we have not accomplished . III In the youth of the body art organ serves the body best by serving itself ? that is , by growing . In maturity an organ serves itself best by serving the body of which it is a part , and that is as true of individuals in a country as of leaves on a tree . In the spring the almost frantic growth of leaves , each for itself , is an impulse on which the whole summer of the tree depends for future sustenance ; but when summer comes and growth is relatively over , the leaves must live chiefly for the tree . As our nation , in common with most of the Western world , has progressed toward maturity , the production of physical additions to wealth has absorbed less and less of our manpower , and promises , in the future , to absorb even less than it does to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it should do just that . Such a process has been going on for a long time , but far too slowly , as yet , to meet the circumstances that face our present generation of young men and women . In 1870 in trade and transportation , clerical service , domestic and personal service , public service and professional service , 23.7 per cent of our population found employment . By 1890 that class formed 29.7 per cent of our workers . By 1910 , 38.5 per cent . By 1930 , 47.1 per cent . And while it has steadily risen , the number employed in agriculture , mining , and manufacturing has declined ? and that in the most completely mechanized world ever created by man . Mining , by 1930 , was below the record of 1900 as a proportionate source of employment . It is now probably below 1890 . Manufacturing and mechanical industries in 1930 were back to the proportion shown in 1910 . They are probably providing to-day the share of national employment they gave us in 1900 . Why do we fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stubbornness in holding on to traditional ideas can explain it . But if we keep on misleading our young people as to where their bread and butter is going to come from , the results will not be reassuring for them or for us . If industrialism is to work successfully , industrial production must inevitably become a minority occupation . The moment we accept that fact we shall be on the right road to solving the problem of unemployment , and the moment the individual man accepts that fact he will probably be on the right road to finding a proper means of creating value through his own activity . This is the primary reality that has to be faced by our rising generation . Against their facing it in time stand pretty solidly the beliefs of most of our mature generation of parents , writers , statesmen , and economists . For all alike are devoting their thought to the traditional problem of how more of our people can find industrial employment . But the real problem is very different . It is this : how can more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that technology may move on unhampered to greater and greater triumphs , through the elimination of unnecessary labor in the production of material wealth ? That is its task and that is the inevitable direction in which industrialism has to move . It seems completely obvious that to preserve industrialism for all of its benefits , which are many , we must create through manual and individual products and through personal services more and more value to exchange for machine-made products . And only in that way can our productive capacities be used for all of our potential consumers , and the worth of our whole life be enjoyed by all of our producers . To increase illimitably or even to increase moderately the output of machine-made products also increases the amount of work done for us by such unconsuming producers as sun , wind , water , and coal , and ultimately aggravates our problem of selling , for any desired return , all the things which we can produce . What are our assets and what are our liabilities in the solution of this problem ? For if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantages in our present situation , I shall be very much mistaken by my reader . Briefly , our assets are these : 1 While it is true that technological advances arc increasing the output per man-hour of labor , and will continue to do so , the largest advance in that direction has already been made . Just as our population is growing at a declining rate , so our man-hours per product of labor are also declining at a declining rate . That is true in the shoe trades , in the sewing industries , in all textile manufacture , and in fact in all industries where labor-saving machinery has been long developed . 2 Most modern products produced by a low ratio of labor to output are growingmore durable . That is , metal goods , and even textile goods of all kinds . If we accept the conditions of our problem , the need to spend most of our money for such products is declining . The need is growing to spend more of our money for the neglected handmade products , such as houses , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist to-day if we could face the truth as to the durability of our manufactured goods . 3 Birth control in the United States is gradually adjusting the supply of people to the demand . The supply of labor is consequently being adjusted to the demand for work under a maturing population age distribution . Though this process of itself takes a long time to yield results , children born in the past ten years will probably not enter a much overcrowded labor market . 4 The changing age pattern of our population will , of itself , put pressure upon the production of houses and similar goods , and increase the demand for services . 5 Maintaining our present national wealth is now , and must always be , a continuous task for a large number of people . 6 Our sixth and most important asset is the millions of young men and women now crowding into the market for employment . The sharecropper and migrant worker , and the people of the city slums are too bogged down in the results of our past errors for us to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of self-sufficiency . But it is by these young people that the question will be decided , whether or not industrialism , now at its maturity , can be made to yield happy lives for men . They stand , it appears to me , at the crossroads of our fate . Like their 8reat-grandfathers , they are pioneers facing a new kind of world , a kind of world that America has never known anything about : a world in which something different from , and humanly better than growth will have to provide jobs and warm the cockles of our national heart . What are the possibilities ahead for them ? What values can they create that will impel a distribution of material goods from the producers of goods to themselves ? Some will find work in industry , which must provide from their ranks for its perpetuation . It is what the others do that will decide whether we are to progress into more general happiness or whether we arc to relapse into a condition of perpetual doles and increasing unrest . IV What services are needed now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed for the next generation ? The first answer to that is easy . We are going to need more physicians . Despite our partial conquest of tuberculosis , diphtheria , pneumonia , and various acute diseases , other diseases and morbid conditions are growing with appalling rapidity , owing partly to the increasing strain of life and partly to the increasing age of our people . A world as rich in productive goods as ours must inevitably make its next forward step through the improvement of national hygiene . The cost of entering the medical profession is now from five to ten thousand dollars . That is prohibitive to almost all but the children of prosperous parents . Yet no one could contend that only the children of prosperous parents can be good physicians . Whether medicine is to be socialized or not , every State in our Union should , as part of its program of public education , provide a scholarship fund to enable gifted students without means to study medicine . In that profession we need , and shall increasingly need , the best available minds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand medical students are graduated every year . That number will not give us an adequate supply of physicians . It will scarcely maintain the present per capita supply , though it is certain that in the future , if our national wealth is maintained , we shall be demanding a constantly improving health service , both public and private . We do not need any better motor cars than we have today , we do not need them to be faster or more comfortable , though we may get both . But we do need better health at age fifty , and when we are willing to demand such goods a cause of unemployment will disappear . We need research men in a hundred different lines , in chemistry , in physics , in biology , in medicine , in dietetics , in every type of industry , in plant breeding , in agriculture , in economics where a science is still waiting to be born , and in meteorology , to name but a few . In all of these fields values are now being asked for by human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present generation . They are not likely to be paid very generously for that service but they will be paid . We are still far more willing to spend four or five billion dollars to prepare against almost impossible invasions than to spend a tenth or a hundredth as much to prepare against the constant and unremitting attack of enemies to civilization and even to democracy in our own bodies or our own towns . When we attain a real awareness of ourselves and of life and of civilization , that will conceivably be different , and it may come soon . We do not now know the proper diet for men past sixty or even for men past forty . We do not know the effect of the vitamins on longevity . We know little about cancer , or heart lesions , and not enough about diabetes and nephritis the four morbid conditions which kill most of our people . We do not know enough about the prevention of blight in towns and cities . We do not know whether men and women need the same or different foods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those growing neuroses which afflict all civilized peoples . The mental causes of physical ill health are largely unexplored . Dental decay is a mystery . Industrially , we need a good synthetic wool and a satisfactory material for the soles of shoes . We need better antiseptics . We need substitutes for tungsten , rubber , manganese , and tin . If we had a few such substitute materials available we might never have to go to war to protect our foreign sources of raw materials . We need engineers to build new works and also to maintain the vast structure of our present material civilization . We shall need them very badly , and the more young men who are adapted to technical training and can get it , the better for us all , if ? but only if ? they do not all anticipate that building bridges , dams , and skyscrapers is what they are being trained for . Durable goods are durable goods , and a good bridge or a good dam is built only once in many generations , and a good canal is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day is not the primary constructions . We need engineers who can deal with the consequences of engineering . We need economic and sociological engineers , and planning engineers , who know as much about human nature as they do about the modulus of elasticity . We need them for recreational plans and civic plans , in all kinds of communities , from the borough to the great metropolis . The task awaiting this generation is to make a world in which human beings are not necessarily unhappy . To that end engineering training should be broadened , and young men and women sent out of our technical schools with sharpened but flexible minds ; for we are going to need , in ever increasing numbers , engineers who understand humanity , physicians who understand industry , nurses who understand handicrafts , chemists who understand physiology , and architects who understand everything . We do not need more courtroom lawyers , or let us hope we shall not need them . Judging by the enrollments in the universities of our most populous States , the supply of young men and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In that fact of itself there is opportunity for really gifted legalminds . Unquestionably the law still offers great possibilities for the energetic and ambitious , for we do need attorneys who understand many kinds of technic , and also counsellors at domestic law who understand profoundly the psychology of men and women . We need lawyers who can keep people out of the courts . To young men and women able to choose a professional career and naturally interested in the possible reward , it can be frankly said that among law , medicine , and engineering , on a financial basis , there is no marked difference in probable earnings . The average net incomes of physicians and lawyers and of certified public accountants are all in the same range ? around four thousand dollars a year ? certified accountants having somewhat the edge on the other two professions . Doctors appear to get ahead faster and lawyers to have more staying power and to earn more in their later years than practicing physicians are able to do . But the maximum is about the same in either case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. L. Sackett , of the Engineers ' Council for Professional Development , " For an engineer of average success , we would expect his income curve to rise from a beginning point of $1,200 to $1,800 , to a maximum at the age of 60-65 years , where a figure of $5,000 to $7,500 may be reached . For those who are less fitted by training , temperament and other factors , incomes of engineers level off at ages from 40-50 to perhaps $2,500 per annum or less . " All of these figures refer to our present experience and not to the future . How perilous it is to guess about that we all know . But this much is certain : good hard training in the law , in medicine , or in engineering , or in any other exact profession , is a lifelong asset to those who can take it and survive it . Suppose conditions were radically to change , that training will still be humanly useful . It will be valuable to other men . And that is my test as to its worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the public , of the vital importance of adult education and recreational training , the supply of teachers is going to exceed the demand for a considerable time to come . There will always however be a place for those who , with adequate knowledge of something to teach , are also endowed with that natural ability to instruct others for which no substitute has as yet been found by the pedagogical schools . Recreation accounts to-day for a large and growing proportion of the national expenditure of our producing classes . In the largest meaning of the word , it involves , as a field of occupation , writing , acting , the equipping and management of public playgrounds , and of State and National parks . Our nation 's consumption of power has scarcely risen for twenty years , but our national drive toward outdoor life , toward increased enjoyment of all kinds , has through all these years continued to grow like a thing of youth and promise . Does this change seem astonishing ? Must we expect that the same forces will always be growing or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life . Those who are fortunate enough to get a sound training in any humanly useful branch of knowledge may approach the future with a minimum of concern for security , and a maximum concern as to all the utilities they can generate out of themselves . And that , it appears to me , is the only way men or women should ever approach their world . But professional training is not the only form of preparation the lucky ones can get . There is also the training in skills . We have lately been shocked into an awareness of how precious the skill of human hands still is to the creation of machines for our defense , and of how little we have regarded that prime necessity . Trained young hands are needed to-day for the protection of our civilization , hut they are needed more to make it work , now and hereafter , when this war is ended . Handicrafts are generally regarded as a picayune business , a preoccupation for faddists and unworthy of serious discussion when the general problem of employment has to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich people , who now have the bulk of our income , save too much money , it is because they have nothing sensible and contemporary to spend their money for . Handicrafts are individual creations in which the machine contribution is at a minimum and the human contribution at a maximum . Their products cost more than machine-made products , because they are produced entirely by consumers . They represent a very important device for the redistribution of income , for work done and value received . ? Twenty years ago the American handicrafts had almost perished . They arc reviving now in obedience to natural law and in accordance with the principle I am discussing ? that a distribution of income is to be accomplished not by taking from one class and giving to another , but by the creation of desired goods and services in successive layers outward , by which process value moves both ways . In every civilization that has endured , the applied arts have had an importance astonishing to the American archeologist of a generation ago , who supposed himself ? as most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the applied arts were an inconsiderable and effeminate diversion of women and half-men . But the point quite overlooked by all was this . Those ancient civilizations remained balanced , often for immense periods of time , while ours ? witness Europe to-day ? is unbalanced after a very limited life . They were balanced because they provided work for all men to do at all ages . Judging by their mortal remains , by all that is left of them , a very considerable part of their labor must have been devoted to the applied arts . Our industrial civilization will not be balanced , or provide work for all until a similar condition obtains among modern nations . Two things are thus vitally necessary for the salvation of industrialism ? a public education in non-mechanical wants and a private enterprise in the supply of non-mechanical utilities . Individualism , beginning with the pioneer efforts of our great-great-grandparents , created the basic capacities of our nation and developed them . Individuality always counts , but in the established and necessary industries of our country , for the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some hold that its day is over altogether . But the reverse is true . Individuality is merely transferring its field of opportunity . The search for values that can be created by one man for other men , outside and inside of industrialism , is certain to result in a constantly increasing variety of occupations . It is easier to say what has to be hunted for than what will be found . Nobody could have told the early pioneers into Kentucky what their example would make of the Western territories that are now the heart of our nation , though John Filson in 1784 took this flyer at the prophetic : " Let the iron of your mines , the wool of your flocks , your flax and hemp , the skins of the savage animals that wander in your woods , be fashioned into manufactures and take an extraordinary value from your hands . Then will you rival the superfluities of Europe and know that happiness may be found without the commerce so universally desired by mankind . The recital of your happiness will call to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there deliverance from their chains . " To-day our men and women , old and young , face such a new frontier , a frontier of equal promise . They face it just when we had come to believe that all the frontiers of opportunity were being closed forever . These are the things I would tell young men and women now coming of age . Hunt for a value which you can create for other men and you will find , not so much a job as an opportunity to get from this world the equivalent of what you give it . The values that will be sought and paid for in tangible returns are increasingly in needed services to human comfort , health , and pleasure . Whoever finds an acceptable way to add to any one of those three has found work that other men will pay to have done . If that seems too abstract a principle , we can bring it down to earth at once . You are twenty . You are out of a job . I do not know what kind of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and over in this article , its basis has to be the production of worth for somebody else . And that is a principle you can practice anywhere and at all times . You have , let us guess , lived on your parents up to the time of your graduation from high school or college . You have probably done little in equivalent for what it has cost for you to be alive ? not so far . That is right enough , for what you have cost your parents you will pass on to your children . But from now on it is no longer right . Your first job therefore is to begin to return some equivalent for your present support . But how can you do this if you have no job ? Well , you can do that very easily if you are a normal person living in a normal American home . While you are looking for a job and cudgeling your brains for ways to add some use to other people 's living , also take time to examine your house . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value . What can you do to increase the wealth and security of your family ? Your position makes it temporarily necessary for the family wage earner to exchange part of his earnings for the privilege of having you under his roof , and that is very natural on his part , but it is not so on yours to accept it without some return . Can you improve your own home ? Can you make it more valuable by a coat of paint , by working on its shrubbery or grounds , by making needed repairs , by fixing everything that is broken , by making new window screens , by decorating or refinishing its shabby furniture ? by any one of a thousand activities I  - -  Innot suggest to you , because I do no Know your family or your house ? But I am certain there are ways in which you can add to your family 's well-being and create new values that will make the family wage earner feel , by tangible evidence , that your support is appreciated . And you can do all these things without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , to do them will illustrate to you lkow you must pursue your individual es , and what you must be doing if you Ore to advance in any job you get . Dull and uninspiring ? So is acting . So is Arctic exploration . So are all real jobs , much of the time . Men keep on plugging and once in a while a light breaks through . But light rarely breaks for those who do not keep plugging .
