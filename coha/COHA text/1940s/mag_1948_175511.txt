When famed Communist-line Physicist Irne Joliot-Curie arrived from France a fortnight ago , her overnight detention on Ellis Island stirred many a U.S. citizen to protest ( TIME , March 29 ) . News of her arrival also stirred the memory of French Expert Adele Starbird , dean of women at St. Louis ' Washington University . In her St. Louis Star-Times column last week , Dean Starbird recalled a 1946 interview with Mme. Joliot-Curie in Paris . Some Curie-isms : <P> " We were kind enough to think that you were merely stupid after the first world war . But really , our charity can scarcely extend so far in the present situation . . . . <P> " You Americans seem scarcely civilized . You are exactly like the Germans under Hitler . . . . Your workingmen are fools who . . . are satisfied with a raise in wages when they should be organizing to overthrow your Government . <P> " You are deliberately fomenting war . You are imperialists and you want war . . . . You will attack the U.S.S.R. but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . With or without war , there will be no civilization at all in the United States ten years from now . " <P> Dean Starbird reported that , by the time the interview ended , Mme. Joliot-Curie had become " molten lava . " Last week Visitor Joliot-Curie was still erupting . In Seattle , she gave her explanation-the usual Communist line-of U.S.-Soviet tension . The entire trouble , she announced , lay with U.S. citizens , who " look with much more favor on fascism than on Communism . " Her reasoning : " Americans think fascism has more respect for money .
