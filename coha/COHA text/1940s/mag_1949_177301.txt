Of all the 3,352 animals exposed to the atom-bomb blast and radiation in the 1946 Operation Crossroads , none won greater fame than Pig No. 311 . A wriggly , 50-lb. shoat , No. 311 was locked in the officers ' head ( toilet ) of the Japanese light cruiser Sakawa . Hours later , after the Sakawa had sunk , No. 311 was found swimming gamely in the radiation-polluted waters of Bikini Lagoon . She was irritable , and had a low blood count , but ' within a month she seemed to have recovered . <P> Last week , the Navy 's Medical Research Institute at Bethesda , Md. announced that it had given No. 311 as thorough and exhaustive a going-over as any pig ever had . Now grown to a hulking 600-pounder , she will live out her days at Washington 's National Zoological Park . Then the Navy medics want the carcass for an autopsy , just in case they have missed something . Pig No. 311 appears to be normal in every way except one : she is sterile . Was this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " . . . Not necessarily . . . Ordinarily , enough gamma rays to cause sterility also will kill the victim . "
