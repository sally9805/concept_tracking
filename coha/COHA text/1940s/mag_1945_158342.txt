The Prime Minister had long ago laid down the Government 's postwar policy on Japanese Canadians : they would be dispersed across the Dominion , never again be allowed to concentrate in British Columbia . Last week the British Columbia Security Commission , the federal agency in charge of Japanese Canadian affairs , went into details : <P> A survey of all Japanese Canadians ( some 23,000 ) will begin in early April . <P> Those who volunteer for repatriation will be sent back to Japan after the war , with expenses paid and with compensation for property they leave behind . ( In Ottawa , estimates of the number of volunteers ran from 4,000 to 10,000. * ) <P> Those who wish to stay will be asked to settle somewhere east of the Rockies , " as evidence of their desire to be good Canadians . " <P> Those who decline to make a choice will be considered " disloyal , " presumably subject to compulsory repatriation . <P> British Columbians generally applauded the Commission 's plan . Some even thought it was too lenient ( in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee recommended legislation making it illegal for Canadian Japs , wherever born , to own or lease any land or business ) . Anti-Jap feeling was strong elsewhere , too . Alberta 's Public Works Minister W. A. Fallow said that his Province wanted no postwar Japs . Quebec 's Premier Maurice Duplessis said that he would take " necessary steps " to see that no Japs were relocated in his Province . Said Nova Scotia 's Premier A. S. MacMillan : " We 've got troubles enough . " <P> Few Canadians spoke up for the Japs who had moved eastward from British Columbia in the early days of the war-although most of them had proved to be good workers and had fitted quietly into their new communities . <P> * For news about U.S. Japs who want repatriation , see U.S. AT WAR .
