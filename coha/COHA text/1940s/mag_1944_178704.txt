Consumer credit men braced themselves - they were going to have the unprofitable distinction of being the last men tapped for reconversion . From Washington came word that the Federal Reserve Board would keep the screws tight on consumer credit until manufacturers are again pumping out enough peacetime goods to meet demand . <P> In 1941 the consumer credit industry happily reckoned its alltime peak volume at $9.5 billion . Of this sum , U.S. citizens were pledged to pay $5.9 billion on the installment plan for autos , home appliances , furniture and jewelry ; charge ac counts and personal loans on " easy " terms added up to $3.6 billion . <P> In August 1941 , the Government announced Regulation W , to help ward off inflation by making borrowing and buying more difficult . These credit restrictions , aided by the shortages of consumer durable goods , cut consumer debt almost in half , to a current $4.9 billion . <P> Each time reconversion talk bubbles up , installment finance men get hopeful . Only such small specialty groups as the jewelers have openly agitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are pleased with the regulation , claim it has speeded payments , kept accounts in good shape . <P> But last week credit men who want the regulation eased found a new argument . Wise relaxation of the controls , they said , can allow individuals to hold on to their war bonds and still buy long-wanted goods . Thus , they argue , pressure on the Treasury can gradually be relieved without sacrificing purchasing power . <P> But the proponents of gradual relaxation had no real hopes ; the Federal Reserve Board 's position as of last week was to keep consumer credit warming the bench until the board sends it into the game to ward off deflation .
