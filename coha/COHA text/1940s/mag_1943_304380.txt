( Excerpted from the Congressional Record of last week ) <P> It was Dec. 7 , anniversary of shame , and the Senate Chaplain , Rev. Frederick Brown Harris , D.D. , offered a special prayer for tolerance : <P> ' Fashion in us a mind forgetful of past ill will , a heart of forgiving love . . . . " <P> ( Up rose Virginia 's Harry Byrd , who has rigorously avoided personalities in his ten years in the Senate . Senator Byrd felt moved to answer a statement made by Pennsylvania 's Senator Joe Guffey . He notably ignored Senatorial courtesy , referring to the Pennsylvania Senator only as " Guffey . " ) <P> MR . BYRD : " He Guffey charged that : a ) northern Republicans , under the leadership of Joe Pew , and southern Democrats , under the leadership of Harry Byrd had conspired to deprive the armed services of America of the right to vote ; and b ) that this alleged conspiracy was the ' most unpatriotic and unholy alliance that has occurred in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world was defeated in 1919 . ' <P> " This statement was a gratuitous insult to 24 Democratic Senators and 18 Republican Senators , who voted their convictions in support of the soldiers ' voting bill . I have reliable information that this misleading statement will be sent through various Government agencies to the members of the armed services . . . . This will be done I am told under the guise of information to the soldiers , but the official dissemination of this misleading charge against United States Senators is a contemptible and indefensible act . The soldier who receives such a statement will believe that the facts alleged are true and , unless he receives at the same time a contradiction , he will be led to believe that something evil has been done in the United States Senate ; that some sinister political chicanery has been accomplished for the purpose of depriving him of his right to vote ; and that this has been done ... by trickery . . . . <P> " This charge made against the 42 members of the Senate , Guffey did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate floor in the presence of those he maligned and misrepresented . <P> " Never before , Mr. President , have I risen on the floor of the Senate to answer an attack made upon me , but never in my ten years of service in the Senate has the provocation been so great . . . . There is not one iota of truth in a single part of the statement made by Guffey . ... I do not even know Joe Pew , and never had any communication with him . . . . <P> " The charge that northern Republicans , under Pew , and southern Democrats under me , adopted the **27;12521;TOOLONG voting bill is , on the record itself completely inaccurate . ... Of the 42 votes cast in favor of this legislation , 17 were cast by southern Democrats and six by northern Republicans , making a total of 23 or less than one-third of those Senators voting . The balance of 19 votes came from four northern Democrats , three western Democrats , and twelve western Republicans . <P> " In all my experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never known a more deliberately offensive or a more untruthful charge to be made against a group of fellow Senators than this charge made by Guffey . <P> " I demand , Mr. President , that the Senator from Pennsylvania , Joseph F. Guffey either prove the charge he has made , or rescind his statement . . . .
