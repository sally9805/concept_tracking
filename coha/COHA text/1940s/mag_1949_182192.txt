Amos ' n ' Andy started it last September when they left NBC and sold their show to CBS for $2,000,000 . The Bureau of Internal Revenue examined this complicated deal and agreed that the $2,000,000 was subject to a capital-gains tax ( 25% ) instead of personal income tax ( up to 77% ) . <P> CBS , dangling the juicy bait of tax savings before other NBC stars , soon made off with Jack Benny . Bing Crosby , Edgar Bergen , Phil Harris , Fibber McGee &; Molly , and Red Skelton were reported planning to join the exodus to CBS . This week the tax collector cut the gossip short . He had bad news for radio stars who would like to revise contracts . <P> For CBS and Amusement Enterprises , Inc . ( Comedian Benny 's corporate entity ) , the Bureau of Internal Revenue ruling meant that the $1,356,000 due Benny from CBS as 60% stockholder was subject to a whopping $1,030,000 in personal income taxes . Until he got the dire word , professional skinflint Benny had hoped ( on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only $300,000 in capital-gains taxes . <P> The rude blow from Washington filled the air with lamentations , explanations and evasions . An Internal Revenue Bureau spokesman unofficially explained the apparent reversal of the earlier ruling by pointing out that the Amos ' n ' Andy transaction was a transfer of real property , since the show presumably could go on forever , even after the death of its originators ( Charles Correll &; Freeman Gosden ) . But the Jack Benny Show , without Benny , would undoubtedly collapse ; therefore , Benny 's personal services , rather than his real property , are involved . <P> The new friendship between Benny and CBS also seemed to be suffering a strain . CBS Vice President Frank Stanton declared that it was " utterly fantastic " for anyone to expect CBS to make up Benny 's tax losses because of the bureau 's ruling . Said Stanton , washing his hands of the whole affair : " From here on out it is strictly a matter between Mr. Benny and the Revenue Bureau . " <P> NBC said nothing , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amused , I-told-you-so onlooker.
