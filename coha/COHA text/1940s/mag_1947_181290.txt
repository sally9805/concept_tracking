The Japanese take the word " dear " literally , even at the start of a letter . Last week General MacArthur took care to begin his letter to Japan 's Premier with a curt " Mr. Prime Minister . " <P> The letter was as barren of endearments as the salutation . Shigeru Yoshida 's Government , it said , had better take prompt steps to tighten Japan 's economy and wipe out its black markets , or it could expect no help from the Allies . <P> As a victorious administrator of enemy territory and idealistic prophet of democracy , General MacArthur had long disclaimed any responsibility for Japan 's economic welfare . But Allied policy had made it necessary to limit her foreign trade and shut off many of her vital materials . By last week Japan 's currency had increased by almost 100 billion yen in a single year . Prices spiraled in an inflationary whirlwind that sucked living costs and wage demands high in its wake . <P> Again &; again SCAP had told the Japanese Government to get rid of the Control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the economy but had not been able to raise Japan 's production above one-third of the 1930 level . Last week when , in the face of impending economic disaster , the rubbery Yoshida Government again evaded the Control Association issue , MacArthur even threatened to seek advice from the four-power Allied Control Council . <P> Said one august Control Councilor in surprise : " It 's not advice that Japan needs now , but absolution.
