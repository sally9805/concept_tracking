For four years and a month Rear Admiral Husband E. Kimmel had waited to tell his story of the Pearl Harbor disaster . Now he had his chance . <P> White-haired at 63 , he was still burly , still erect . Going to the witness chair , he walked into the glare of cameramen 's klieg lights with the air of a man expecting complete vindication . For two days , with the flat authority of the quarterdeck , he hammered away at the central theme of his defense-that the Navy had kept him so inadequately informed that he had been " misled " into believing an attack on Hawaii was " not imminent or probable . " <P> Like a man recalling an oft-repeated dream , he speculated that the disaster might have been turned into a victory if he had been properly advised : he would have " gone to sea " with the fleet , stood ready to ambush the Japanese task force . <P> Then came the crossexamination . The Navy 's famed Nov. 27 message to Pearl Harbor had begun with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Had n't the Admiral considered this highly significant ? His answer boomed : " I did not consider it an extraordinary message ! " <P> Said Kimmel : " No reasonable man in my circumstances would have considered the war warning was intended to suggest ... likelihood of an air attack . ... There was no dereliction of duty on my part . " But his questioners drew out the fact that the day after the " war warning , " he had ordered depth bombing of any suspectedly hostile submarines . Admiral Kimmers temper began showing signs of wear . <P> By week 's end the hearing had made plain what history had demonstrated pitilessly many times before : commanders who would avoid suspicion and controversy must also avoid military disaster .
