txt Paul G. Hoffman , who left a lucrative position in private industry to head the Economic Cooperation Administration , was told today by Senator Kenneth chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee , that his resignation would be " a very good thing " for the people of Europe and America . On the basis of a radio news broadcast , the chairman accused the ECA chief of trying to " bully " the committee into favorable action on European recovery funds . Mr. Hoffman retained his composure and quietly denied trying to " pressure " the group by a " threat " of resignation . The witness lost patience , however , when Senator accused him of " sending a lobbyist to see me at my hotel who tried to tell me how wrong I was and how right you are and told me you promised him some job in Korea . " " That 's an absolute falsehood , " snapped Mr. Hoffman . " I do n't know the man from Adam 's off ox . A man tried to see me this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me about a conversation he had with a Senator . I told him that I was sorry but that I was too busy trying to catch up with my work . " Ferguson Backs Hoffman Several times Mr. Hoffman tried to interrupt the chairman to restate his position on the pending appropriation and the conditions that might induce his resignation , but Senator continued : " Other than giving away other people 's money , I wonder what good you are doing in Europe . I think it would be a very good thing for the people of Europe and the people of the United States if you did resign . " Senator Homer Ferguson , Republican , of Michigan , broke in to say that he did not consider Mr. Hoffman 's remarks concerning his possible resignation as in any sense a threat and that he did not think Mr. Hoffman considered them as such . " Do n't you think , " Senator Ferguson asked , " it is a good thing to have people in the Government who are willing and able to resign if they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoffman should be complimented . There are too many who stay when they know they ca n't do the job . " " Well , I did take it as a threat , " Senator persisted . He turned again to Mr. Hoffman . " You have undertaken to do it before and you are not going to do it this time , " he said . " I think it would be a good thing for the people of Europe and the people of the United States if you did resign . " " I think it would be a great calamity , " volunteered Senator Feronson . " Well , every man is entitled to Ibis opinion , " observed the chair ! man . A little later Mr , Hoffman said ithat he had not offered a job in ' Korea . to any one .. " I am down here for the same . reason that you are -- to do a public service , " he went on . " And I ' will remain in Washington only as ' long as I can do that service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false notions about my ability or the job I am doing . " I have said I would administer the program to the best of my ability and that if I came to the conclusion I could not administer the program successfully then I would resign . " Mr. Hoffman had testified previously that a nut as great as $500,000.0110 in the $3,568,470,000 approved by the House for ten and a half months would wreck the European Recovery Program and that the committee should either appropriate enough money or throw out the program now . The ECA. head has been questioned intermittently by Senator since he denied on Wednesday a telephone conversation shout hardwood exports attributed to him by the chairman . Senator promised to prove his point by correspondence he said he subsequently had with Hoffman , but so far he has brought in no evidence .

" " If I did n't believe that would n't he in Washington today , " Mr. Hoffman replied . At another point Senator Guy Cordon of Oregon asked the witness whether " you really think " there is any chance of peace . with Russia . Mr. Hoffman replied that he had " a sound basis " for the hope that a peaceable understanding would he reached between Russia and the Western Powers in the next five years . He declined to disclose the source of his information hut said " some real hardheaded people believe that . " " I can see in five years the possibility -- -and I emphasize the word possibility  --  of being in the kind of world situation in which the United States will ma ke more progress than she has in the last quarter of a century . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of western Europe can Iremain free . Mr. Hoffman said , then " the people in the Kremlin will make up their minds they had better come to a decision to live and let live ..
