WASHINGTON , Aug. 26 ? Unanimous agreement was reached by the Ways and Means Committee today on an excess profits tax bill , designed to prevent the creation of " war millionaires " out of the new defense program , while allowing corporations to recapture within five years the new capital invested in extra plants for rearmament . The measure would levy the tax generally on all corporations , but permit the taxpayer to use either the " invested capital " or " average profits " method for figuring his excess earnings . It was approved in principle also by the Treasury officials who have been working with the legislators on this new revenue problem . No conclusive forecast could be made of the bill 's probable yield , although unofficial estimates for a full year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce upward of $160,000,000 from excess profits accruing from this year 's business operations . For completeness and unanimity , the committee 's action was described by Chairman Doughton as " historic . " " I doubt there has been such an important measure reported from this committee with such unanimity in its entire history , " said Mr. Doughton . " Rush Order " Put on Bill The drafting of the measure was turned over to Mr. Doughton , Representative Cooper of Tennessee , chairman of the subcommittee on taxation , and the Congressional and Treasury tax experts , with a " rush order " attached to it . The bill is slated to be introduced formally in the House tomorrow afternoon . After a routine reference back to the Ways and Means body for a report , it is expected to reach the floor for action on Thursday . " We have every expectation of finishing it this week , " said Messrs . Doughton and Cooper . The measure as worked out finally today will be reported to the House in three sections . One would suspend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on profits from naval and aircraft construction , leaving these earnings to share the same fate as all others in the excess-profits tax . The second would set up a system whereby corporations investing In new plant facilities certified by proper governmental authorities as necessary for manufacture of defense materials and equipment night set aside tax-free earnings ever a period of five years to amor:ize this new investment . The third would impose the ' avier taxes on excessive profits made by any corporation as a remit of or during the national de:ense emergency . Levy From 20 to 50 Per Cent The excess earnings would be axed under the bill at rates rangng from 20 per cent on the first 20,000 , to 50 per cent WI all above 500,000 , depending in part on the ' ormula a taxpayer chooses in cornmting these earnings . These taxes , noreover , would be in addition to he normal corporate levy , whose affective rate now runs up to a naximum of 20.9 per cent on in ; ome in excess of $25,000 annually . In computing excess profits under he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods . First , hey could average their earnings or the years 1936 to 1939 inclusive , . nd pay the excess profits levy on Lll taxable income above that aver.ge . Second , they could pay on any irofit in excess of a certain return n the capital actually invested in heir business . In revising the bill today the cornnittee agreed to exempt from the ax any corporation 's earning up to per cent on the first $500,000 of invested " capital , and 5 per cent n the balance . The Cooper subommittee had recommended an arning limit of 6 and 4 per cent its recent report on the excess rofits proposal . For those taxpayers choosing the average earnings " formula , rates rould apply as follows on the exess : The first $20,000 of profits above verage earnings , 25 per cent ; the ext $30,000 , 30 per cent ; the next 50,000 , 35 per cent ; the next $150 , - ) 0 , 40 per cent ; the next $250,000 , // PROFITS TAX BILL IS AGREED UPON // 45 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Furthermore , corporations using this method also would be required to pay an additional 4.1 per cent on their normal tax net income ? the amount not considered in " excess . " For the users of the " invested capital " method of computation , the following rates would be applicable under the present bill : The first $20,000 , 20 per cent ; the next $30,000 , 25 per cent ; the next $50 , - 000 , 30 per cent ; the next $150,000 , 35 per cent ; the next $250,000 , 40 per cent , and all over $500,000 , 45 per cent . The rates and formulae set out above were products of compromises within the committee and between the Ways and Means members and Treasury officials . In the last-minute changes this afternoon the tax authors agreed to several other changes , all designed to : nake the measure more workable or more " airtight . " Provision was made in one of these to take care of inequities that might result where , profits of certain corporations were reduced during the period selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , floods or other acts of God . For instance , a taxpaying corporation might have suffered a tremendous loss in 1937 as a result of a fire . To the extent that loss was not covered by insurance the corporation was permitted to charge it off against its gross income in making up its average tax returns for that year . Now , in setting up its average earnings between 1936 and 1939 , that loss would reduce considerably the base on which the corporation must compute its profits for purposes of the excess profits tax . To remedy such situations , the committee wrote into the bill a provision that , for the purpose only of computing the excess profits levy , such a taxpayer will not have to deduct such a , loss in setting up average earnings . Naturally , it would be to the advantage of a taxpayer using the " average earnings " formula to show as much earning as possible during the base period . Provision for Farm Processors The committee wrote in a comparable provision to take care of processors of agricultural commodities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to escape the " windfall " tax imposed by Congress , soon after the Supreme Court outlawed the first Agricultural Adjustment Act . In another change the committee inserted an escape clause for " deficit " corporations who might elect to use the " invested capital " method of computing their tax . It provided that in the case of corporations whose capital was reduced as a result of operating losses , these taxpayers , would not have to write down their " invested capital " base to an extent greater than surpluses previously accumulated . If , for example , a corporation capitalized at $100,000 should make $10,000 in one year and not divide it among stockholders but keep it as surplus , and the next year lose $20,000 it would only write down its " invested capital " for purposes of computing the excess profits tax , to $100,000 as a result of the loss . The committee also ordered a provision allowing greater latitude in computing their taxes to corporations engaged in shipbuilding and subject to the 10 per cent profit limitation under the Merchant Marine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporation either to list only the 10 per cent allowable profit , or to report its entire gross income and take as a credit against its excess profits tax any amount recaptured by the Maritime Commission over the statutory 10 per cent . Another change related to personal service corporations and would permit such a corporation so to define itself for tax purposes only if 80 per cent of all of its stockholders were engaged at - all times in the conduct of its operation . Special provision is made in the excess profits tax plan for personal service corporations whose invested capital is not material to its income .
