txt Japan is not a happy land today . It is characteristic of the state of the country that one instinctively reaches for a negative to describe its present plight . Although the Japanese like to think of themselves as a positive , aggressive , fighting people , the visitor to Dai Nippon in its current phase is likely to be chiefly impressed by shortages , prohibitions , irresolution , confused councils , and general stagnation . For here is a people not fundamentally militaristic despite their self-delusion on the subject , but primarily craftsmen and traders , whose continued involvement in a tiresome and profitless China war has eaten away at the very heart of their national existence . Like some of the rest of us , the Japanese are fond of fine phrases . They love fads and novelties of all sorts . Throughout the period of their undeclared war on the Asiatic continent they have fed themselves on words and **31;66;TOOLONG gesticulation : but now they are in the fix of the farmer who tried to make green spectacles take the place/ of his cow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that is the kindest way to express the situation . The Cost of War Japan 's present war cost  --  that is , the cost as it works out from figures of the 1941-2 budget  --  is something over 20,000,000 yen a day . At former exchange that would be $10,000,000 in American money . though current exchange ratcs are not 2-1 , but between 4 and 5 to 1 officially , or as much as 10-1 on the " black market "  --  the exchange which runs in secret in Yokohoma but openly in Shanghai . Any way one figures the thing , it is n't small change . Figures are not always the whole story , as is amply proved by the way Japan has been able to carry on as against the propheries of those who felt the Nation must collapse in six months or a year of crushing war costs . Still , they are not without some meaning . The Nation has n't collapsed , but the Japanese man in the street today finds it well-nigh impossible to find decent leather to shield his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife , though she may be pleased to learn that Japan 's leaders find it possible to export some powdered and condensed milk , is less pleased at the trouble she experiences in getting any fresh milk for her babies . Whatever the actual figures come to , they mean that the two supplementary military budgets together with the general account appropriations for the Army and Navy come to a cost 7.5 times larger than the corresponding sum for 1935-6 ( over 7,500,000,000 yen as compared with 1,032,000,000 yen ) ? figures comprising 67.9 per cent of the all-inclusive treasury expenditures , as compared with a corresponding ratio of less than 50 per cent five years ago . And while costs have gone up , productivity has gone down . A factory with its manpower weakened by the presence of a million husky lads in China , and itself perhaps wholly or partly devoted to production of some form of supplies for the missing million , is not adding to the national wealth except from the long-range imperialistic point of view which bears an uncomfortable resemblance to that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as scends of economic investment . In other words , Japan is spending her sons , her national resources , her yen and sen , on a long gamble which  --  contrary to rosy expectations  --  is not returning dividends so far and which on the other hand demoralizing the public and private life of the country . This last statement would be challenged by leading Japanese . It is still debatable . But there is evidence behind it . Obviously , when a country goes on spending as Japan has done since the summer of 1937 , there must be major readjustments as soon as surplus is exhausted . And Japan never had much surplus at best . As a trader-manufacturer nation , Japan always kept pretty well extended . Her peacetime commitments to daring investment averaged high . With entry into its first great war in several decades ( they preferred to call it an " incident , " which in itself is a study in use of words ) the Japanese found them " - selves up against the joint necessity of providing more revenue and cutting their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just was n't any option . structure " notion , and under his leadership the militarists have thrust torward their latest idea of a " Grealet East Asia Co-Prosperd ) Sphere " ? not thus far marked by any great actual prosperity lei anybody concerned , and appal ently designed to concert an increasing number of apprehensit e peoples . Speaking in the Diet last Feb. t , on behalf of the much-criticized " Imperial Rule Assistance Association , " Premier Konoye said among other things : " In order to construct a high-tension defense state , reorganization of the national structure is highly urgent . The Imperial Rule Assistance Association is something hke a core of the reorganized national setup . It will sponsor such a campaign as to urge our people to assist the Thorne in their respective fields of business . Thus , the association is highly political in nature . By political , however , I do not mean that the Association takes part in political tree-lor-all as the dissolved parties in the past . . .

The " high- international missions . tension defense state " is to be developed  --  probably with a good deal of concealed German advice , which is not openly admitted by the Japanese and often resented , however handy it proves . In the words of a New Year message from Ichizo Kobayashi , Commerce and Industry Minister , " The new economic structure has now been mapped out on a firm basis under which the people can live with a sense of security , happily and in high spirits . " To a people remarkably adept at concealing their happiness and high spirits , Mr. Kobayashi gave the further assurance : " The new structure does away once and for all with the idea of private ownership with Government operation , or overdoing control for control 's sake , even going to the extent of destroying the livelihood of smaller merchants and manufacturers . It has now become clear that as before , private ownership and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's industrial structure . After thus getting rid of the recent apprehension and uncertainty , business and industry will be expanding with renewed vigor . " Wartime " Restrictions " As a wartime measure , " Mr. Kobayashi went on , " the restriction of dividend and remuneration payments will be a necessity . The new economic structure requires that any profits made in excess of the maximum distribution limits be retained in the business in the shape of Government bonds or other assets to be disposed of later at a more opportune time . This arrangement is certain to dissipate the feeling very often entertained by the people that they were virtually being required to work for nothing but pains : - While it is now clear that Japan has been made safe for capitalism , this assurance has been rather lost sight of through the alarming prospects of fresh southern adventure and the possibility of war with America . Many a Japanese sighs for a return to the day when Japan attended to its own business in-             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
