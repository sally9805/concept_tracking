In the perennial search for something to head off or cure the common cold , two doctors at the Permanente Foundation Hospital in Oakland , Calif , ( established in 1942 by Shipbuilder Henry Kaiser ) gave twice-daily doses of penicillin to almost 1,500 volunteers . An equal number , serving as controls , were given chalk pills . <P> Neither group knew which dosage they got . <P> After a year , in which more than $100,000 worth of penicillin was used , the doctors came to a sad conclusion : if you want to ward off a cold , chalk is just about as useful as penicillin - and a lot cheaper . Neither prevents a cold .
