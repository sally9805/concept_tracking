Two aging and ailing champions , Assault and Stymie , in Aqueduct 's Edgemere Handicap . Assault , fourth-highest moneywinner in turf history ( $672,520 ) , closed gamely despite a patched-up leg and finished third . Stymie , still the world 's top moneywinning horse ( $911,335 ) , was rapturously applauded as he went to the paddock for his first race since he was retired with a cracked sesamoid bone 14 months ago . After finishing dead last , Stymie was still cheered . In keeping with the quaint custom at New York tracks , the boos were for Jockey Eddie Arcaro , who rode My Request , the winner . <P> Wizened little Johnny Longden , rider of more winners ( 3,402 ) than any other U.S. jockey , who interrupted a visit to his native England to ride - and finish last - aboard a 66-to-1 shot in Doncaster 's historic St. Leger Stakes . " It was a good race , what I saw of it , " chirped 39-year-old Longden . <P> Britain 's six-girl Wightman Cup tennis team , which sometimes outshone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went to defeat for the 13th consecutive time , at Haverford , Pa. ' s Merion Cricket Club , 7-0.
