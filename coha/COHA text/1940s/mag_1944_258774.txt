For 22 Fascist years , the only Italian in all Italy who dared openly badger Mussolini was famed Philosopher Benedetto Croce . Through his brilliant , semimonthly philosophical magazine La Critica , Croce continued saying what he felt to be eternally true , even though these truths often contained political implications insupportable to Fascism . La Critica had a select , world-wide circulation , was read avidly by Italian university students . It was one of Mussolini 's great mistakes that he did not stop the mouth of this one voice of liberalism . <P> In Sorrento last week , 78-year-old Philosopher Croce announced that at year 's end he will abandon La Critica ( established in 1903 ) , but will go right on speaking his mind in a brand new review to be called I Quaderni della Critica ( Notebooks of Critical Thought ) .
