Early last week Wendell Willkie , setting out on his second foray in search of farm votes , drove deep into the enemy territory of Des Moines , home town of Democrat Henry Wallace . In the office of Iowa 's bush-browed Governor George Wilson ( where four years ago Candidates Franklin Roosevelt and Alf Landon conferred about the drought ) , Willkie sat down to hear about farm problems from four farm-belt Governors , some 60 big &; little officials , farm-organization leaders , farmers . That meeting was followed by two smart Willkie moves . <P> Appearing before 5,000 Iowans massed in front of the Capitol steps , he referred to Henry Wallace as " a very eminent public servant . " To a soft moan of boos from his audience he quickly put a stop : " I mean that quite seriously . . . I recognize Mr. Wallace as a fine gentleman and as a scholar . . . . " Appearing at a lunch of Oren Root 's Independent Willkie Clubs , he addressed them with two words which may well become the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next morning Republican papers howled with glee as they slapped it on their front pages . <P> Leaving Des Moines next morning , he returned to Colorado Springs to complete the first draft of his acceptance speech , knead together and throw in his Iowa farm findings &; conclusions , which , like his opinion on other major issues , remained Wendell Willkie 's secret . <P> Between meals , his daily swim and a few unavoidable chats with unavoidable visitors , he fed the hungry press three more crackling front-page stories . <P> First , he picked up a week-old suggestion of Roosevelt-baiting Columnist Westbrook Pegler , announced that he favored two amendments to the Hatch Act : 1 ) he would require the President , Cabinet members , heads of chief regulatory bodies to file statements of their assets upon assuming and leaving office ( adding that he would require all members of his family to do the same ) ; 2 ) he would prohibit members of the President 's family or the families of other Government officials from receiving compensation for services performed for any person or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Next , he jumped with both feet on Democratic Chairman Edward Flynn 's campaign books ( see above ) . Onetime Lawyer Willkie warned that " such contributions are a direct violation both of the Federal Corrupt Practice Act and the second Hatch Act . . . . If I am elected President of the U. S. , all violations will be relentlessly prosecuted . " <P> Third , in the midst of a press-attended conference with Herbert Hoover in his sixth-floor suite at The Broadmoor , he learned that Elliott Roosevelt had just registered at the hotel . While Hoover squirmed , frowned , tapped his foot restlessly , Willkie phoned the President 's second son , invited him up for a drink . <P> As he packed his bags for the trip back to his home town of Elwood , Ind. , where he will make his acceptance speech on Aug. 17 , politicians were still puzzled about Wendell Willkie . Polished politicos began to think him a very professional amateur .                 @ @ @ @
