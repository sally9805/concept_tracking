LOOK BACK ON HAPPINESS - Knut Hamsun-Coward-McCann ( $2.50 ) . <P> In his essence , the " I " who tells Look Back On Happiness is 79-year-old Knut Hamsun himself , as fierce and fine an old man as ever declined to batten on the adulation of fools . And his novel is less a novel than a devoutly unpretentious rec ord of things he values , or despises . <P> He values , as he has valued all his life , bare nature itself , and human living inter locked with nature . He despises , as he has for years , what he summarizes as " the modern spirit in Norway " ( read " the world " ) and to the " little upstart heart " of the " modern " reader he addresses his book . <P> First seen in the silence of a winter alone in northern Norway , this old man begins , with the spring , to drift . The following summer he spends on a farm which , thanks to tourists , is swiftly disintegrating . He is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks : " England will soon have to open old people 's homes for her sons . She desexes her people with sport and obsessive ideas : were not other countries keeping her in perpetual unrest , she would in a couple of generations be converted to pederasty . . . . " Most of all he deplores what he sees in Ingeborg Torsen , a fine young woman who , thanks to her feminist education , has become a sexual derelict , disconsolately out for what she can get . She manages inadvertently to cause a murder ; she is bound , for a while , to a dismal little actor who lives off her . Subtly , she is interested in the old man ; uneasily , he is drawn to her . During the next year or two he continues to see her . In the long run he has the satisfaction of seeing her well-married ( to a carpenter ) , grey-haired , hard-worked . <P> Of his own uncertain affections , his age , his gradual loss of power ( " They were planned so big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly glow " ) he tells no less serenely . " I have followed the septuagenarian of literature step by step , and reported the progress of his disintegration . " He ends his book with a quiet , magnificent diatribe which should make most readers duck , most smug old men-of-letters blush . <P> " I can no longer herald a renaissance ; it is too late now . Once , when I had the power to do much and the desire to do more , mediocrity everywhere was too strong . I was the giant with the feet of clay-the lot of many youths . But now , my small , small friend , look about you : there has appeared , even within your field of vision , a figure here and a figure there , a shining crest , lavish with its bounty , geniuses beneath the open sky-you and I should bid them welcome . I walk in the evening of life and , trembling , recognize myself in them ; they are youth with jeweled eyes . Yet you begrudge them your recognition ; yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
