txt FIRE BLAZES AGAIN IN NORMANDIE HOLD Caused by an Acetylene Torch , Smoky Blaze Is Put Under Control in 31/2 Hours Fire struck again last night at the former French luxury liner Normandie and burned inside her for more than three and a half hours before it was considered under control . Black smoke billowed for hours from the stricken craft , lying on her port side at the West Forty-eighth Street pier since the disastrous blaze of Feb. 9 . It was the third fire in less than three months , and all of them were caused , the police said , by workmen 's acetylene torches . This blaze , which started in a rear subhold of the ship on the starboard side , was started by an employe of the salvage company that is attempting to right the ship . It was announced at 11:45 P. M. by Commander Walter A. Sullivan of the Navy that the fire had " started decomposed stores which the salvage people were attempting to remove . " Other reports indicated that the fire spread to cork insulation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fire did no damage to the ship 's structure , Commander Sullivan said . As firemen fought the blaze , one of them was critically injured . . He was Fireman Daniel Cavanaugh , attached to the staff of the Assistant Fire Chief , who fell forty feet through an open hatchway . He was treated by Dr. Thomas Sullivan of St. Clare 's Hospital , given the last rites of , the church by Father John Danascene of St. Clare 's , and taken to Roosevel // FIRE BLAZES AGAIN IN NORMANDIE HOLD // Hospital for X-ray examination of 1 his back . Mayor La Guardia and Fir ' e Chief Patrick iValsh visited the Scene , but left shortly before 11 o'clock without making any announcement about the blaze . The fire apparently gained great headway before it was discovered . After the first alarm was sounded at 6:10 P. M. , great clouds of smoke poured from the craft , almost obscuring her from view . When the second ' and third alarms were sent in , bringing to the scene twentyfour pieces of fire-fighting apparatus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More smoke came pouring forth when firemen , using acetylene torches , cut several holes through the ship 's starboard side to get at the fire . Earlier attempts to reach the blaze from the 45-degree-angle main deck were unavailing . Hose lines were brought across two gang-ways that lead from the pier to the up-turned side of the ship , but the task of getting them through to the fire taxed - the ingenuity of the seasoned fire fighters . After the holes were cut in the side , beneath the normal waterline , which now faces skyward , the firemen dropped special spray nozzles into the hold , directly into the fire area . It was more than three hours after the start of the fire , however , before a direct line of water of any considerable volume could be played onto the fire . Meanwhile the fireboats Duane , Harvey and Firefighter arrived on the scene and helped Dump water from the river . Mayor La Guardia was on board the Firefighter , watching and directing . Commander Sullivan explained that " the great difficulty in fighting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the compartment in which the fire was were located under water ; it was necessary to cut away covers which had been welded over in order to get water to the fire . " As a precautionary measure , Navy and Fire Department ambulances were at the scene , as well as a special disaster squad of ten nurses from St. Clare 's Hospital . Twenty-eight Coast Guardsmen helped the police to hold large crowds in check and to divert traffic from the area . All except government and naval officials and those with official business in the district were barred . Air raid wardens who arrived in droves after the first alarm were among those whom the police kept away . Fire Commissioner Patrick Walsh arrived at 8 P. M. to take personal charge of his men , with Captain W. A. Pashley in charge for the Navy . A short while later Assistant District Attorney Paul Lockwood arrived to question those concerned in the Normandie 's latest misfortune . No one was prepared to say how long this latest blow at the crippled liner , now the U. S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship 's funnels , which at the time of the overturning were barely clear of the water , have been removed by the salvage company along with most of the superstructure . There is little if anything protruding above the main deck . After a preliminary investigation by the police and fire officials it was announced that the fire was started by an employe of MerrittChapman &; Scott , marine salvager which holds the $5,000,000 contract for raising the crippled liner . It was reported that sparks from his torch set the fire . This was believed also to have been the cause of the first fire and also of the second on March 13 . The latter blaze was slight and easily extinguished . The first alarm was sounded at 6:10 P. M. from a box near the ship after smoke was seen coming from behind the catwalk that bridges the upturned bottom of the ship . Half an hour later , when firemen saw that the fire might become unexpectedly serious , a call for a rescue squad was sent in by Battalion Chief Robert Noonan . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. the third was sent by Deputy Chief Edward Connors , who was in charge of the fire-fighting forces at the time of the first fire . Only two days ago the House Naval Affairs subcommittee reported after a thorough investigation of the first fire that the blaze had been due to carelessness . Possibility of sabotage was ruled out . The Normandie was taken over along with thirteen other French vessels on Dec. 12 by the United States Government . She was renamed and was about to be converted into a troop ship , when the Feb. 9 fire put her out of commission . The Normandie was built at St. Nazaire in 1935 at a cost said to have been $56,000,000 . The 83,423-ton ship was the pride of the French nation and at one time held the blue ribbon for the fastest Atlantic crossing . Before workmen started to transform the liner into a naval auxiliary vessel she was stripped of $2,000,000 worth of luxurious fittings .
