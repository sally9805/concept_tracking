" What America needs today is a good 5 war song . The nation is literally crying for a good , peppy marching song , something with plenty of zip , ginger and fire . Something like Over There , Keep the Home Fires Burning , Pack Up Your Troubles . . . . " <P> So said New Jersey 's Representative J. Parnell Thomas . Songsters agreed with him . They were grinding out 5 tunes with all the old zippo they could muster , but so far , no Over There . Recent 5 tunes : <P> Tin Pan Alley turned out a song for the Free French-I 'm a Soldier of De Gaulle , by the French-descended radio singer Conrad Thibault ( published by Mills Music , Inc . ) . United Free France ( De Gaulle agency in the U.S. ) accepted the song as " official . " Copies were sent to General de Gaulle in London , to Free French headquarters in Beirut ( Syria ) and Brazzaville ( French Equatorial Africa ) . Sample English chorus : <P> I 'm a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from her fall . " <P> So I 'll walk or ride or crawl <P> To a new land for us all . <P> I 'm a soldier of De Gaulle . <P> Most popular song on the juke boxes , networks , sheet-music counters was The White Cliffs of Dover ( " There 'll be bluebirds over . . . " ) . <P> The much-abused Tchaikovsky piano concerto had disappeared abruptly from best-selling and radio-plug lists , but another classic was in the offing-Grieg Piano Concerto , recorded by Bandleader Freddy Martin , who had started the Tchaikovsky boom . <P> A Variety tabulation of best-sellers of 1941 included The Hut-Sut Song , Elmer 's Tune , Joltin ' Joe Di Maggio , Booglie Wooglie Piggy . <P> Irving Berlin , court composer to the Government , turned out his fourth and fifth official songs , President 's Birthday Ball ( for the Infantile Paralysis Fund ) and / Paid My Income Tax Today ( Treasury Department ) . * Excerpts from the latter : <P> I never felt so proud before <P> To be right there with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> I 'm squared up with the U.S.A. <P> You see those bombers in the sky , <P> Rockefeller helped to build them ; <P> So did I. <P> Pearl Harbor and anti-Jap songs began creeping up the lists . Citizens of middling age recalled the songs of earlier days , when melodies and sentiments were sweeter . It was doubtful that anyone will ever have the courage to write of 1942 , in the vein of 1922 : " He kissed her dreamily as from the nearby ballroom came the soft strains of I Paid My Income Tax Today . ... " <P> <P> *Earlier he wrote Any Bonds Today ? ( Treasury Department ) , Arms for the Love of America ( War Department ) , Angels of Mercy ( Red Cross ) .
