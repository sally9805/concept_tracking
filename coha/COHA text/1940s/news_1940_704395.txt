txt Congress will reconvene tomorrow for what Administration leaders fear may be one of the most controversial sessions in recent years , despite their efforts to subdue the probable disputes in the interest of a short and peaceful session and a united Democratic party in an election year . The session will begin officially at noon , with separate meetings of the House and Senate . The two branches will convene in the House chamber at 2 P. k. to receive personally from President Roosevelt his annual message , which , according to those who saw parts of the manuscript today , will deal chiefly with international questions and will be singularly free of controversial discussions of domestic subjects . The annual budget message , in which it is reported that the President will call for expenditures of above $8,000,000,000 for the fiscal year 1941 , and suggest additional taxes and other means for decreasing the heavy deficits , will be sent to the Capitol on Thursday . The Executive reviewed his plans and hopes for the third session of the Seventy-sixth Congress at an hour 's conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Kentucky , the majority leader of the Senate , and Representative Rayburn of Texas , majority leader of the House . It was the first meeting between the President and the Vice President since the latter announced his can-i didacy for the Democratic Presidential nomination . New Major Legislation Unlikely The leaders left the White House with a strong impression of the non-controversial character of the President 's message and plans , so far as they affect the domestic situation . They were convinced that he would seek no major new social and economic legislation ; that he would confine his part of the legislative program largely to measures for national defense , and that his major domestic task would be to bring about a budgetary adjustment , either in the form of new taxes or new bookkeeping , that would lighten the deficits . These Congressional veterans were not persuaded , however , that the President 's disinclination to provoke further controversy with and within the legislative branch would suffice to assure a peaceful session . They realized that Congress was meeting in the growing heat of national politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the year , with partisan feeling running higher and higher , and with no less than six aspirants for the presidency sitting in the halls of Congress itself . They were aware , also , that two highly controversial measures are awaiting the reconvening of Congress . One is the Anti-Lynching Bill , which its sponsors plan to force to the floor of the House as early as next Monday , and the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act , the renewal of which the President will seek before it expires by its own terms on June 12 . Numerous other issues are expected to come up , including suggested amendments to the National Labor Relations and Wage-Hour Acts , and the Social Security Law , but few will be more bitterly contested than the lynching and trade treaties issues . Explains Annual Message The President went over his annual message in some detail with the leaders , and told them in general what the budget recommendations would contain . One of the participants in the conference prophesied that tomorrow 's account of the " state of the Union " would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point on the expenditures side of the budget message is expected to be a recommendation for a record peace-time fund for national defense . The amount is expected to go well above $2,000 , - 000,000 , with recommendations that it be divided virtually evenly between the Army and Navy . The President also intimated that he would seek new taxes with which to pay between $400,000,000 and $500,000,000 of additional defense outlay . He may not suggest particular methods for raising the new fund either in his annual or his budget message , but he has dis CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS IN HAPPY MOOD AFTER CONFERENCE WITH PRESIDENT William B. Bankhead , Speaker of the House of Representatives ; Vice President John N. Garner , Alben W. Barkley , majority leader of the Senate , and Sam Rayburn , majority leader of the House , leaving the White House yesterday . Times Wide World CHIEFS LOSE HOPE OF MEEK CONGRESS // cussed repeatedly a proposal similar to that suggested several years ago by the late Senator Couzens of a flat " super " tax of 10 per cent on the net payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 1940 . Under such a plan a person whose income tax payment figured at $500 , under present rates would simply add $50 and pay $550 . Under the proposal as discussed by the President , this super tax would be levied for a specific length of time , say one or two years , and for a single purpose : in this case , national defense . The President is also known to have considered a plan whereby a number of agencies now receiving funds directly from the Treasury or from the sale of securities to or through the Treasury might float their own obligations and finance themselves more on a self-liquidating basis . This would permit a continuation of some expenditures without reflecting them in the deficit or in an increase in the national debt . How far the President has proceeded with these ideas , or others , which he has advanced from time to time relative to liquidating certain assets and recoverable items in the Federal ledger , is not known . Therefore , it is only a matter of speculation as to whether he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the session . He has impressed his leaders , however , with the thought that he regards budgetary adjustment as perhaps the primary domestic task at this time , and that he will endeavor to keep the legislative decks as clear as possible of other matters so that Congress may turn its attention to this job . While the President and Democratic leaders were arranging for the session 's opening , Senators and Representatives were meeting in various unofficial conferences to talk over the legislative prospects . From these little gatherings came the greatest sign of trouble ahead for the Administration leadership . Republicans have offered to supply the leadership in each house to the forces opposed to continuing the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act . A position is expected to be announced by the minority party in the House within the next few days . In the Senate , Mr. of Oregon , the minority leader , has assumed an important role in opposition to extension of the act . Senator Minton of Indiana , the Democratic whip , predicted that the attack on the trade pact program would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am convinced that the Senate does not want to return to the old ' scratch my back and I 'll scratch yours ' type of tariff procedure , " he said . Senator Barkley said that the Senate might kill time at first until the House sent over some of the major tasks for consideration . Renewal of the trade agreements must originate in the House , as well as all appropriation and tax bills . The anti-lynching measure is slated for action first in the House . Southerners declared that it would never pass the Senate , even if they had to filibuster until next January . The House , on the other hand , plans to get busy at once . Chairman Taylor of the Appropriations Committee informed Mr. Rayburn that his committee was well along with its work , and had four regular department supply measures ready for consideration on the floor now . Mr. Rayburn , in turn , told the President that the House could finish all of its appropriation bills by mid-April . Senator Barkley , however , disclaimed any illusions about the session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contention , and looked forward to a session lasting until Summer .
