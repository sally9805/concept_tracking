The big , buff brick Greek legation on Washington 's Massachusetts Avenue was quiet last week ; on sunny mornings a Negro yardman hosed down the sidewalks ; a white-coated houseman swung open the door to visitors in grand unconcern . Inside , white-haired , friendly little Minister Cimon P. Diamantopoulos gravely stated his pride in his country . Throughout the U. S. , in Greek neighborhoods with their fruit stands , vegetable markets , small restaurants and grocery stores , the U. S. 's 700,000 Greeks discussed the news . In the Italian quarters - it was the 18th anniversary of Mussolini 's march on Rome-fruit peddlers and bootblacks told enquiring reporters v/hat they thought of Italy 's war on Greece , but would not give their names or addresses , lest they be accused of belonging to the quinta colonna ( fifth column ) . <P> Between speeches in Manhattan and Boston , President Roosevelt last week spent a day in Washington facing this new international problem . He and the State Department had faced many such situations before . They had developed a routine treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the invaded country 's U. S. funds , lest they fall into the hands of the invader . But last week the familiar crisis routine was not re-enacted . The President , who had long professed to be so occupied with foreign affairs that he had no time for political campaigning , was now so occupied with campaigning that he could spare only a brief interlude for the troubles of Greece . His limousine spirited him from Union Station to the White House . Even the press hardly noticed when Secretary of State Hull and Under Secretary Welles went to him , conferred , departed . <P> No condemnation of Italian aggression was issued , no Greek credits were frozen . ( Minister Diamantopoulos explained that locking up Greek funds would have given the false impression that Greece had already been overrun by Fascist invaders . ) Then the hurried President , having attended to his duties , hastily returned to the main business on hand , campaigning . For the first time in several months domestic politics took precedence over international politics , affairs at home came before affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's political advantage . As long as affairs abroad crowded the campaign and Wendell Willkie off the front page , he had had the spotlight to himself . The reversal of news values gave Franklin Roosevelt the option of sharing the spotlight with his rival or of losing it entirely . <P> Ever astute , he made the best of the situation , made an important announcement part of his campaign . Said he in his campaign speech at Boston : <P> " Tonight I am privileged to make an announcement . . . . The British within the past few days have asked for permission to negotiate again with American manufacturers for 12,000 additional planes . . . . When those additional orders are approved , as I hope they will be , they will bring Britain 's present orders for military planes from the U. S. to more than 26,000 . " ( The present U. S. program calls for 14,000 airplanes for the British by April 1 , 1942 , and many experts doubted whether it could in practice be substantially increased. )      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
