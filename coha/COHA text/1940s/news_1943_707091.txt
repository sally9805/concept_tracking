txt HERLANDS ATTACKS REPORT ON TRADE AS %DULY DARK ' Charges ' Questionable Use ' of Statistics on Manufacturing by Dewey Committee DEARTH OF FACTS ALLEGED Study for Mayor Finds State Tax Data Ignored , Sources of Opinions Unrevealed Mayor La Guardia made public without comment yesterday a report by William B. Herlands , Commissioner of Investigation , . charg-1 I ing that the Hanes committee , by a " questionable use of statistical material , " had painted an " unduly dark picture " of the city 's and State 's manufacturing trends . Mr. Herlands asserted that Governor Dewey 's committee had ignored favorable trends in the city 's wholesale , retail and service trades employment and in some of its manufacturing industries and he denied that the sales tax had hurt wholesale and retail business . The Commissioner defended the New York City tax rate on real estate as lower than the rates in fifteen other cities in the State , and declared that the State Controller held New York City real estate to be " underassessed " by 5 to 10 per cent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seen He charged distortion of the significance of labor costs in the city , and after pointing out that the Hanes committee had not named any of the business men and other persons it questioned , he declared that " to a great extent the conclusions in the report are based upon hearsay . " The committee , headed by John W. Hanes , former Under-Secretary of the Treasury , and including David Dubinsky , president of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union ; Elliott V. Bell , Superintendent of Banks , and Delos Walker , vice president of R. H. Macy &; Co. , was appointed last November and its report was made public last Sunday by Governor Dewey . It reported that declining trends in the manufacturing industries of the State and city presented a-problem that would require joint action by the city 's ablest leaders in industry , labor , commerce and the civic authorities . Business men and others questioned gave high taxes and assessments , labor differentials , congestion of traffic and transportation and Washington hostility as among the major factors adversely affecting business in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that statistics as presented hi a table of the Hanes report were misleading and that the committee , by its use of them , had ' palmed an unduly black picture by " pyramiding percentages . " He said : " This is clear from an analysis of the following table and text which are contained in the committee 's report : " ' New York State 's share of national manufacturing : Per Cent Change in Per Cent of Share National of Nae -- Total -- - , tional 1931. 1939 . Total . Number of establishments 19.8 18.7 - 5.6 Number of wage earners 13.0 12.5 - 3.8 Amount of wages 15.4 13.3 - 13.6 Value of products 15.8 12.6 - 20.3 Value added by manufacturing 17.6 13.5 - 23.3 " ' As will be seen , the State 's share of the national total of value added by manufacturing has declined in this period 23 per cent , while the value of its products in proportion to the national total has fallen 20 per cent and the numbers of its wage earners nearly 4 per cent . ' Herlands Gives Figures " Examination of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the State 's ' per cent of national total ' during this period was only 1.1 per cent in number of establishments ; one-half of 1 per cent in the number of wage earners ; 2.1 per cent in amount of wages ; 3.2 per cent in value of products , and 4.1 per cent in value added by manufacturing . " Instead of showing the change in the State 's share of national ? total by simply subtracting the 1939 figures from the 1931 figures , the report has puffed the figures by taking a percentage of a percentage . Thus , for the factor ' value added by manufacturing , ' the difference between 17.6 per cent and 13.5 per cent is - 4.1 per cent . In order to skyrocket to ' - 23.3 per cent , the report divided - 4.1 per cent by 17.6 , per cent . " Mr. Herlands asserted that " the essential fact still remains that the change in the State 's share of the national ' value added by manufacturing ' was only 4.1 per cent . " Even more important for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State 's ' number of wage-earners ' in relation to the national total , was only one-half of 1 per cent , ' he added . The Commissioner declared that actually New York had less of a decrease in industrial employment than twenty-eight other States , and that only Maryland , Virginia , North Carolina , South Carolina , Georgia and Tennessee gained in the 1929-39 period . Due to " confusion of State and city statistics , " the Hanes report failed to show that employment in the men 's clothing industry in the city had gained 13 per cent in the period , and that the city was 9 per cent better off than the State in electrical machinery and job and book printing , the Herlands statement said . The Hanes committee failed to show , the Commissioner continued , that the decline in New York City 's industrial employment in the 1929-1939 period was 9 per cent , or " 1.5 per cent less than the decline for the country as a whole . " The New York City industrial area , including Newark and Jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1929-39 period than six of the ten principal industrial areas , Mr. Herlands continued . The Hanes committee also failed to ' report increased employment in the wholesale , retail and service trades , he said , although 64 per cent of all wage-earners in the city were in nonmanufacturing employment . The Commissioner , discussing the committee report that " there was general agreement that the burden of taxation , including the New York City sales tax , had operated to the disadvantage of business in the metropolitan area , " said : " One would expect if the sales tax were to have a deleterious effect it would be in the wholesale and retail trades . But as we have noted above , employment in the wholesale and retail trades in New York City has expanded considerably , even though a sales tax was imposed in December , 1934 . Despite the alleged harmful effects of the sales tax , the department store sales index increased from 56.4 in 1933 to 63.3 in 1939 , and the payroll index increased from 60.5 in 1933 to 73.6 in 1939 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain over the sales volume for 1940 , and R. H. Macy and Abraham &; Straus reported the largest volume of sales in their histories . " The Commissioner , comparing the New York City real estate tax rate with those of other cities , reported that in 1939. thirty-eight cities in the country with populations above 100,000 imposed higher real estate taxes , including Chicago , Detroit , Boston , Los Angeles , Pittsburgh and Buffalo . He said the State Department of Audit and Control reported New York City had a lower total tax rate in 1941 and 1942 than fifteen other cities in the State . Cites State Tax Figures " In fixing equalization rates for the City of New York , " Mr. Herlands continued , " the State Tax Commission has actually declared that New York City property is under-assessed by from 5 to 10 per cent of ' full value . ' The State Tax Commission has fixed the tentative rates of equalization ' for the fiscal year 1943-44 for the five New York City counties as follows : New York , 95 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent ; Queens , 90 per cent ; Richmond , 91 per cent . " According to the State , New York City real estate is underassessed by 983 million dollars . " In reporting that labor differentials were " mainly responsible for the retarded growth of the dress industry in New York City , " the committee ignored , Mr. Herlands said ; that " one of New York City 's I greatest assets is its reservoir of skilled labor which is naturally en , titled to higher wages . " Heading a section of his report as " An Omission : History of Wall Street , " the Commissioner said : " Decline of Wall Street 's business is attributed by the committee to regulations introduced in 1933 . Not mentioned is the effect on the Wall Street business of the 1929 crash and the abuses which necessitated the 1933 and 1934 statutes and regulations . " In eonclusion the commissioner wrote : " The report is replete with conclusions , but meager as to substantiating facts . The sources of information are not disclosed . The report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off its conclusions in regard to taxes and assessments with the comment ' general agreement . ' As to ' labor differentials , ' no figures are given nor is any detailed analysis made . The report merely states that the conclusion represents a " preponderant , although not unanimous view ' .
