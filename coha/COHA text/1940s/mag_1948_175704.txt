At Johns Hopkins University last week the weather outside was rainy ; indoors it was heavy . Some of America 's highest browed literary critics had gathered to discuss just what a critic 's job is . Scholars and professors from 30 colleges , professional critics and a handful of writers were there . <P> The biggest crowd of the conference turned out to hear Princeton 's R. P. Black-mur . Said he : <P> " There is a great deal of obscurity in modern writing which could be cleared up if writers could be forced ( only by criticism ) to develop a skill in making positive statement . . . whether in verse or in prose . Statement may make art great and ought not to be subject to fashion . . . <P> " We have also a decay of the power of conviction or mastery ; we permit ourselves everywhere to be overwhelmed by the accidents of our massive ignorance and by the apparent subjectivity of our individual processes ... It is a world alive and moving but which does not understand itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Kafka , if you really look into them . The difficulties arise . . . partly because of the conditions of society . . . The audience is able to bring less to the work of art than under the conditions of the old culture , and the artist is required to bring more . . . almost the whole job of culture has been dumped into the artist 's hands . . . The burden of criticism in our time is ... to make bridges between the society and the arts : to prepare the audience for its art and to prepare the arts for their artists . " <P> Absent from the Great Critics sessions was the sage of Baltimore , Critic H. L. Mencken . But over a beer , Mencken peppered the visitors with a shakerful of critical opinions . Sample : " The thing about Theodore Dreiser always was his enormous unintelligence . He reached heights of unintelligence as great as any of the heights of intelligence that Aristotle achieved .
