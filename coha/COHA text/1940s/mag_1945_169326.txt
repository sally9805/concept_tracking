Beyond all doubt , Ed Stettinius knew how to run his railroad . Some of the San Francisco delegates wondered whether he knew exactly where he was going . But he got full marks for speed and efficiency ; he made the rest of the U.S. delegation feel that they were in on the doings ; and on occasion he even broke into warm , human rage . <P> The biggest testimony to his early success at the conference was a perceptible change in the kind of things people said about him . When he arrived in San Francisco , some of his own associates were asking each other how long he was going to be Secretary of State . Now the talk was that his ability to run the State Department and front for the U.S. in world affairs was no longer in serious question . What worried the new powers in Washington , said the conference grapevine , was the thought that Ed Stettinius , as Secretary of State , was next in line of succession to the Presidency . <P> The Companions . Stettinius made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cordell Hull , never failing to give them credit for advice or decisions , when doing so would strengthen the U.S. position . He relied on daily , minute " briefings " by his department experts , remembered what he was told with amazing exactitude , and did not hide the fact that he would often have been at a loss without this assistance . <P> Once or twice , when he was in a tight corner at committee meetings , he looked to Anthony Eden for guidance . By comparison with Eden , whetted by 19 years of disciplined British diplomacy , or with Molotov , the hardened product of ruthless revolution , Ed Stettinius seemed almost callow . But when the chips were down , he earned their respect and that of the conference . <P> Some of the wisest diplomats in San Francisco felt that his seeming victory in getting the shabby Argentine Government admitted to the conference ( TIME , May 7 ) had in fact been a triumph for Molotov , Stettinius ' forthright support of Argentina , said they , unnecessarily pointed up the disproportionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gave Molotov a brilliantly used opportunity to pose as the conference 's moral spokesman in opposing the Argentine jingoes , and generally cost the U.S. more than it gained . <P> But Stettinius could hardly have taken any other course . The recent trend of hemisphere policy , not to mention the pledges at the recent Mexico City conference , had committed the U.S. to a straight power game , as amoral as Russia 's game in eastern Europe . In the case of Argentina the two gamesters clashed , and the U.S. won the dubious showdown . Thoroughly at home in that kind of contest , Molotov next day blandly joshed Stettinius and Eden : " You know , gentlemen , that little voting game we had yesterday may become a dangerous game . Imagine a country having at her disposal the 19 Latin American votes , plus that of the Philippines , plus that of Liberia , plus its own one . Well , that country would have all of the votes .
