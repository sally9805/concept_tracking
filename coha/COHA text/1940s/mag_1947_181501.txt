Christian Archibald Herter , 52 , who marshaled the congressional investigation of Europe , is a gentleman politician . He cuts a fine patrician figure on Boston 's Beacon Hill , likes to hunt ducks on his own preserve in South Carolina and has never known the rigors of doorbell-ringing in the wards . But few Congressmen work as hard or as effectively as lanky ( 6 ft. 5 in. ) , handsome Chris Herter ; fewer still can match his first-hand knowledge of Europe . <P> Herter , whose parents were wealthy expatriate artists , was born in Paris . He lived there until he was nine , was brought to the U.S. for schooling . After getting a degree cum laude at Harvard , Herter went back to the Continent . In Berlin , Brussels and Paris , he performed various chores for the U.S. State Department . During World War I ( he was rejected for Army service ) , he met Food Administrator Herbert Hoover , spent four years working as his secretary and assistant . <P> In 1924 , in partnership with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the Independent . It did poorly . The partners launched a new and slicker magazine , the Sportsman . It did poorly , too . Herter started lecturing on international relations at Harvard . <P> Help from a Boss . Then he ran for state representative from Boston 's silk-stocking Fifth District ( Beacon Hill and Back Bay ) . With the help of a former Harvard roommate , who was the districts Republican boss , he won in a breeze . In the legislature , he did an unspectacular but thoroughgoing job . In 1939 , he was elected speaker . Three years later , when eccentric old George Holden Tinkham announced his retirement from Congress , Chris Herter spoke up for the job and readily got it . <P> Affluent Mr. Herter-his wife , who has borne him four children , was a Standard Oil heiress-went to Washington as a stalwart critic of the New Deal . He thought the Social Security Act " the most colossal and most dishonorable hoax ever perpetrated by any American Government on the American people . " He spoke seldom and studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye with Arthur Vandenberg . In 1945 , Herter visited eight . European countries to inspect UNRRA operations , helped push through legislation to provide UNRRA with additional U.S. funds . <P> No Tuxedos . By the time the 80th Congress opened , Herter had already foreseen the vast difficulties which the U.S. would face this year . He introduced a resolution to set up a special committee to study Europe 's economic needs . The resolution went unnoticed until after the Truman Doctrine was proclaimed . Even then , it got bogged down in jurisdictional jealousies . Friendly Chris Herter wanted to bow out of the picture , but Speaker Joe Martin finally straightened things out . Herter ran his committee with a free hand , picked men carefully , gave each man a specific assignment . He told them : " This is a working committee . Leave your tuxedos at home .
