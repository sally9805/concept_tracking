txt William O'Dwyer has been elected Mayor by a great popular majority , and for the first time in twelve years the Democratic party  --  with a new ally , Labor  --  has been returned to power in this c'ity . It is no mere play on words to say that in its own ironic way this result is a tribute to Fiorello H. La Guardia . Twelve years of conscientiously good government in City Hall have softened memories of the last Democratic city administration and drawn a mantle of forgetfulness over the Seabury investigation and Tammany 's tin boxes . Under Mr. La Guardia , good government has come to be accepted as a matter of course . And in these circumstances a city which is normally Democratic in national and State affairs has voted Democratic in a municipal election . If the result has seemed for some time to be a foregone conclusion it has been because of the unmistakable apathy which surrounded the election . This was evident from the start in the comparatively small registration . It was obvious in the failure of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind has been fixed on other things  --  on strikes , on wages , on prices , on jobs and on the return , after four years of war , to more normal ways of living . The only way in which the Republican party , as the traditional foe of Tammany Hall , could have hoped to change this pattern was by nominating for Mayor a candidate who typified the crusading spirit which three times in succession swept a fusion administration into power and kept it there  --  either Mr. La Guardia himself or someone prominently identified with his administration or someone long known as a fighting leader in the cause of good municipal government . This the Republican party failed to do . Its decision  --  its entirely too clever and too obvious decision  --  to nominate instead an ex-Tammany associate on the ground that the best way to win a municipal election is to appeal on narrow political grounds to enough blocs of enough voters simultaneously , has now been rebuked , as it should have been , by the comparatively small vote which this candidate has received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polled by Newbold Morris ? a candidate without a party , without a clubhouse vote , without a real campaign fund and without anything but a hastily improvised organization ? is more than a personal tribute to Mr. Morris . It is a notice to the Republican party of the only means by which it can hope in the future to elect a Mayor of New York City . To the winning candidate , Mr. O'Dwyer , we offer our congratulations and good wishes . We described him during the campaign as an able and upright man . Our reason for opposing him , as we said then , was the belief that even with the best intentions in the world he would , as Mayor , find himself subjected at every turn to the constant pressure of Tammany 's insatiable demand for spoils and heavily indebted to an American Labor party which has been captured by its leftwing faction . If Mr. O'Dwyer now proves that he is stronger than these party forces which contributed so heavily to his victory , we shall be delighted . We do not need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every constructive action he takes in the interest of the whole city and its people .
