 | Is your best friend really a friend or a force of habit ? " Why , of course she 's really a friend , " you protest automatically . " We 've been best friends since we were kids in my home town . " Admirable , when true . But sometimes friendship settles into an uninspired rut of habit or convenience , as automatic as the loyalty you waste upon it . Does your best friend truly keep pace with you mentally , emotionally , spiritually ? It may benefit both of you to take stock of your friendship . Perhaps you see a great deal of this friend , because it is easier to drop in for a chat at her house than to make the effort to meet somebody new . If you confine yourself to her company because of social laziness , the relationship is bound to have a narrowing effect on your life . The happenchance that you went to school together , or that you commute on the same train or serve on the same committee , is seldom enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially the best , should radiate an everwidening circle of acquaintance and interest . Do you and your best friend really have similar interests , or is your association simply a hangover from other days ? Old friends sometimes must take their place on the shelf along with mash notes and hockey trophies . Your friend may be as comfortable as an old shoe , and about as stimulating . If you have grovm apart since the days when you played on the junior team for the glory of dear old Greendale High , you might as well acknowledge the fact . Does your conversation point forward to the future , or always back to the childhood you both remember ? Occasional reminiscences are natural in an association of long standing . But what folly to try to pump life into a lagging friendship with hypodermic queries of " Do you remember when ? ? " It is unwise to cling to a figure from your past just because it is your past . Anyone who has come upon , with a sense of shock , a photograph of herself ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Human beings never really change , they only grow more so . " Of course we change , and in the process develop new interests and new friends ? sometimes dearer than the old . Nothing can be more satisfying than the friend rooted to your past yet flexible enough to share your vision of the future and widen your horizon with fresh ideas of her own . It is futile , however , when experience radically has altered your life since sheltered schooldays , to gear yourself to a companion eternally youthful . Or if intellectual pursuits have led you into an exciting new world of ideas , to limit yourself to a friend who has abandoned the enthusiasms of schooldays for a treadmill routine of house and garden . Even the most congenial friend can pall when you see too much of each other . You may be getting on each other 's nerves because you know each other 's reactions by heart . Do you hesitate to bring up controversial subjects , because experience has taught that your friend ( however dear to you personally ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is prejudiced ? Has she developed an embarrassed giggle , or a whine , or any other conversational tic that you find irritating ? Do you think you will scream if she says once again the " What I mean is ? " that punctuates her talk ? If you find your best friend getting under your skin , take notice of the danger signal . It may indicate too intense an association ; in extreme cases , it means you need a change of friends . One of the dangers of seeing too much of even your dearest friend is that one of you may become a pale carbon copy of the other 's personality . Everyone knows married couples who , instead of complementing each other , are dominated by the stronger , so the weaker is little more than an echo . " I could n't really say . You 'll have to ask my husband , " says the timid wife in answer to @#  | questions about anything from the family budget to the Origin of Species . By absorbing your friend 's mannerisms of thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or vice versa . In friendship , no less than in domestic life , familiarity often breeds mental stagnation . " Better be a nettle in the side of your friend than his echo , " said Emerson . The sympathetic pal to whom you take your troubles can be a consolation in distress ; but it benefits neither of you when friendship disintegrates into a mutual Wailing Wall . Does your friend always back you up and say , " There , there , " to continued plaints that the world is in league to defeat you ? If so , she may be less a true friend than an emotional crutch , upon which you lean when you should have learned to walk erect . Nothing can be more soothing to the bruised ego than a drop of sympathy , skillfully administered . But the friend worth confiding in will help solve recurrent complaints with a dash of bracing truth or illuminating insight into the source of trouble . ON THE other hand , your friend may be a thief of time . Do you have to steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a pair of shoes ? Does she drive you frantic pouring out her resentment over the latest temper tantrum of the child with whom she seems unable to cope ? Do you find yourself squirming at the play-by-play account of her battle with the weeds and beetles invading her Victory garden ? One of the happiest attributes of a rich friendship is the interplay of interest that allows each to speak her mind , almost as though thinking aloud . But to burden each other with the tedious trivia of life is to abuse a rare privilege . If your best friend bores you , is it fair to take up her time ? You may have outgrown the ideas you once shared eagerly . Friendship should be a live , growing thing and not a dead end of lethargy or convenience . Are you sure you do n't bore her ? That may be one of the things Your Best Friend Wo n't Tell You . She may find your new interests and thoughts irritating or unsettling , and you should be alert to her needs as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a polite pretense when each would like to be less beholden to the other . Neither will benefit unless friendship results in mutual quickening of heart and mind . It may be you have begun to disapprove of and talk about your friend behind her back , while continuing to spend most of your time in her company . Backbiting not only is a sure way to undermine friendship , but usually is a warning that the tie is no longer vital . Watch out for remarks beginning : " Fond as I am of Mabel , I must say ? " An unwholesome envy may be at the bottom of a sly dig like : " Mabel 's a smart apple . You 'll never catch her sadded with family responsibility . " To damn with faint praise is flattering neither to your best friend nor to your loyalty . Where there is no honest respect , there can be no true friendship . Do you apologize for your friend to new acquaintances ? Do you " explain " her shortcomings with a " Good old Mabel ? she means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice muslin better stores . c ' ' i , ? yaa , a NILS , BEDSPREADS NGO.ES q. , LOS ANGELES  | all have idiosyncrasies that can stand a gentle chiding ; but if you feel it necessary to make excuses for her character , it speaks poorly for the friendship . Do you hesitate to introduce her enthusiastically ? If your tone implies that she is a poor relation , not quite bright , it is n't likely she deserves to be your closest friend ? all protests to the contrary . Unlike relations by blood or marriage , you have a heaven-sent opportunity to select your boon companions . So potent an influence on your life as a close friend is not to be chosen lightly . There may be a trace of snobbery in the Confuciussay : " Never contract friendship with a person not better than yourself . " But you owe it to yourself ( and to your friend ) to take care that her personality does not cripple your normal development by obliging you to stoop or dissimulate or slow your steps to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other " best friends " and try earnestly to make you part and parcel of the new setup . This can be fine and generous if you feel that your best friend 's new friends are of sufficient stature to interest you . But if they are not , and if the situation after a period of months shows no signs of changing , you have an obligation to yourself to withdraw , as gracefully as possible , from an entanglement that otherwise may end in disagreeable friction . It is wise to keep in mind that your best friend , no matter how stimulating she may have been for years , can have gotten herself in a rut ; that she may have stood still while you progressed . Nothing is so deteriorating to a close friendship as the deterioration of one of the friends . The fact is not pleasant to face ; but it is better to face it in the early stages , to modify the extent of the old friendship and so preserve at least some part of it , than to try to continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not necessarily be of your age , or circumstances , or nationality . But she must possess an essential likeness , an equality of quality , that draws you to her . The South Americans have a word for it : sympatica . The woman who is sympatica understands your moods without tedious explanations , laughs at the same human foibles , kindles with the same enthusiasms . She has a divine blend that fuses with your personality to produce compatability . TOUR best friend should be your favorite person , like a favorite book in which you discover new meanings as you reread treasured passages . Pollyanna and the Bobbsey Twins perhaps absorbed you in childhood , but you outgrew them as you outgrew Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm and Little Women . Today you may find that light novels make pleasant hammock reading ; detective stories while away convalescent hours ; imperative books widen your comprehension of current events . But it is a rare volume that can be savored through a lifetime of changing moods and conditions . More influential than any book is the friend in whom you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a real friend ; but there is no use clinging to something to which Neither of you makes an important contribution . Make sure that each of you is the other 's " best friend " in the fullest sense of that happy term .
