When Julius Albert Krug was called in to replace terrible-tempered Harold Ickes as Secretary of the Interior , there seemed no limits to the glistening future of the Wisconsin wonder boy . Behind him was an impressive record of public service as a member of the Wisconsin Public Service Commission , manager of TVA 's power operations , head of the War Production Board . At 38 , he was the youngest officer in the Cabinet , a hard-driving New Dealer who quickly mastered Interior 's operations and spent at least half of his time in the field , brushing up on department problems at first hand . <P> But as time went on , hulking ( 6 ft. 3 , 250 Ibs . ) " Cap " Krug began to get into hot water . Word leaked out of an intricate financial transaction which gave Krug and his lawyer control of a Tennessee cotton mill ; his name got in the papers in a lawsuit over a $750,000 loan made to him by a New York businessman . It also turned up on the expense accounts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Palm Springs , Hollywood and Manhattan , complete with $100 notations for feminine " entertainment . " ( Krug indignantly called Meyer 's accounts a " swindle . " ) <P> Krug got in rows with other federal officials over reclamation projects , got the President 's back up by going to Congress for more money over the head of the Budget Bureau . He was also found wanting when political accounts were added up after the 1948 election campaign . <P> One afternoon last week the end finally came ; the surprise was not that it came , but how it came . An assistant telephoned top Interior officials : " The Secretary has asked me to tell you he has resigned . " Before Harry Truman got Krug 's personal letter of resignation , he had already read Krug 's 13-word statement to reporters : " I am leaving . I have been wanting to leave for a long time . " <P> Next day , after a friendly exchange of letters with the man who had served him longer ( 44 months ) than any other member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successor a man who fitted an increasingly familiar pattern of presidential appointments . Like Agriculture Secretary Charles Brannan ( a fellow Coloradan ) and Postmaster General Jesse Donaldson , 53-year-old Oscar Littleton Chapman was a longtime career man in his department . <P> A devoted New Dealer from 1933 on under Franklin Roosevelt , Chapman had also proved his undying loyalty to the Fair Deal by covering nearly 26,000 miles in 1948 as advance man for the Truman campaign train . A teetotaler , Chapman at a White House gathering was once asked by Franklin Roosevelt , " Oscar , mix us a drink , " and had to confess he did not know how . The President pretended to be vexed : " I ca n't have anyone in my little Cabinet who does n't know how to mix a Martini . " Earnest , literal-minded Oscar Chapman had to be assured later that the boss was just kidding .
