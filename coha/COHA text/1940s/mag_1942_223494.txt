Two of the fundamental " laws " of physics are being outrageously violated in laboratories by a liquid , helium II . This is ordinary helium reduced to 2.2 degrees above absolute zero ( - 273.18 C or - 459.72 F ) . And physicists discussing this remarkable substance last week were delighted , for when a field of science is wholly reduced to law , scientists lose interest in it , long for unexplained phenomena to puzzle over . <P> The laws broken by helium II , and not yet completely revised to accommodate its eccentric behavior , concern 1 ) the flow of fluids , 2 ) the flow of heat . Some of its lawbreaking properties so far discovered by English , Dutch , Russian and U.S. researchers : <P> &gt;A liquid , it is more fluid even than hydrogen gas . It will flow freely through the most infinitesimal cracks and pores in containers , between two face-to-face surfaces of optical glass . <P> &gt; " If a cup partly full of helium II is lowered part way into a bath of the same liquid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identical height , as if there were a perforation in the cup or a siphon over its rim-but there is no siphon and there is no perforation , " writes Physicist Karl Kelchner Darrow of the Bell Telephone Laboratories in Reviews of Modern Physics . " The cup need not even be partly full to start with-it can be empty initially , and the liquid will climb invisibly over its rim from the bath . " <P> &gt;It conducts heat some 200 times better than silver and copper , best thermal conductors hitherto known . <P> When two vessels filled with helium II at slightly different temperatures are connected by a fine tube , a heat-carrying current of liquid will flow into the cooler vessel almost as fast as it would drain off into an empty one . And the countercurrent returning in the same tube will move completely without friction . <P> This behavior fits none of the most hallowed formulas , whose Greek and Roman letters now lie tumbled about like a child 's alphabet blocks . Faced with the need for elaborate rebuilding of formulas , Physicist Darrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is like finding unexplored land in the midst of an ancient community , or a tract of primeval prairie among the cornfields of the Middle West .
