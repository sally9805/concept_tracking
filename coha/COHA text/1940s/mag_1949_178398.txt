Under the smooth promotional hand of Pillsbury Mills , Inc. , 100 top amateur U.S. cooks competed last week in Manhattan 's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in a $70 , - ooo prize baking contest . With 100 electric ranges set up on the ballroom floor , the cooks-97 women and three men-donned aprons and went to work . All day , under the watchful gaze of judges , the hopefuls produced such culinary delights as golden glow cake , black &; white pie and glorified cherry upside-down cake . <P> When the time came to hand out the $50,000 first prize , it was won by a simple roll with the fanciest name of all-the " water-rising nut twist . " The winner : Mrs. Ralph E. Smafield , 32 , wife of a Detroit electrical engineer . The recipe , as expected , was a family treasure , which Mrs. Smafield got from her mother who " got it 25 years ago from a friend in Wisconsin . " Pillsbury labeled it top secret , saved it for publication later . <P> Second prize of $10,000 went to Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cookies ; third prize of $4,000 to Mrs. R. W. Sprague of San Marino , Calif , for her Carrie 's Creole chocolate cake . <P> The men won nothing .
