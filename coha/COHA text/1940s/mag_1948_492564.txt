WHEN my dad crawled off the rods under a freight train on a hot . Kansas day in August of 1878 , he did n't like the looks of the place , and inquired the time of the next train . " There ai n't none going on from here , " said a smooth-talking Irish slicker who met the trains in search of customers . " End of the line . This is Wichita , the Peerless Princess of the Plains . Settle here and you 'll be rich in no time . " They told the immigrant that the " city " had a population of 3000 , but there was no way of proving it . Assessors ' figures give the 1947 population as somewhat more than 196,000 . The muddy , dusty , shack-strewn settlement of 1878 has evolved into a neat , shady , busy city , a little self-conscious in its comparatively new prosperity , but pushing forward with almost fanatical determination . Like Charleston , South Carolina  --  so often destroyed and so often rebuilt  --  Wichita has thrived on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , depressions and crop-killing pests have brought temporary gloom again and again , but have achieved an end result of determination and courage in the face of disaster . Moderation is not the outstanding virtue of Wichita . Extremes and extremities seem to form a tonic for amhil Weather is a topic of conversation , not merely for passing the time , but in deadly earnest . It furnishes OF AMERICA many of the stimulating extremes . Kansans do not like the word " blizzard , " but if snow , ice , high wind and sleet make a blizzard , you 'll find one occasionally on these wide plains . The hot winds of late July and August are crop destroyers . They do not come every year . If they did , there would be no Wichita , since crops are the most important factor in the city 's prosperity , even since industrialization came in . The coldest day in recorded Wichita history was in 1899 , with temperature twenty-two below zero , high wind from the north , and drifting snow . That 's something to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day was in 1936-114 degrees . But the mean high and low over a period of fifty-seven years are a better index of climate . Mean high for August in that period , 90.8 ; mean low , 68.5 . The average annual precipitation over the same period is 30.26 inches . That is enough for abundant crops , if fairly distributed when needed . But there is a tendency in the erratic climate to provide alternate drought and flood periods . This gives rise to the story , perhaps not original in Kansas , of the evangelist who was called from Los Angeles to hold a series of prayer meetings for rain in Wichita . Even as the series closed , the skies opened and the waters fell . The minister departed with blessings and a generous collection . He obligingly returned two weeks later , however , at the urgent call of the faithful . In the flooded tabernacle , before a drenched congregation , he lifted up his voice above the roar of the cloudburst and prayed , " Yes , Lord , we did pray for rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , good Lord , this is ridiculous ! " The Arkansas River  --  pronounced " Ar-kan ' - ess , ? except in the state of Arkansas  --  is joined by a tributary , the Little Arkansas , in an area now wooded and occupied by many semirural homes . Here , where there were water and cottonwood shade , the Wichita Indians set up grass huts in 1863 . They were loyal to the Union , and had been driven from their former homes by Confederate Indians . An enterprising member of the party was Jesse Chisholm  --  pronounced " Chis 'm " ? half-breed Cherokee , adopted by the Wichitas . He staked out a ranch on a tortuous creek , later called Chisholm Creek , a few miles east . This waterway long blocked the growth of Wichita eastward , but is now a wide , straight canal , draining flood water from higher ground to the east . James R. Mead and William Greiffenstein started trading posts and were the first permanent white settlers . Both were town builders , accustomed to hardships , unafraid of frontier dangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town grow into a city , and long cultivated his farm south of town . His numerous descendants live in Wichita today . The loyal Wichitas were summarily moved out of the area by the Federal Government in 1867 . This opened the land to white occupancy , and the village of Wichita was incorporated in 1870 . But Wichita was still a question mark of dust and mud when , in 1872 , a group of farsighted citizens started talking about getting the Santa Fe to build its road down from Newton to Wichita . Newton had succeeded Abilene as the most westerly rail terminus , and thus had become head of the Chisholm Trail , over which cattle were driven from Texas to the nearest railroad for shipping . The trail had been blazed in ruts by Chisholin 's wagons , carrying trading goods to sell to Indians . If the Santa Fe could be induced to make that extension , Wichita would become the cattle town . Though there were then no rich men in the strug-gling village , the necessary money was raised , and Wichita had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the rip-roaring cattle town of the movie tradition . The substantial early settlers looked on and said that this was a beginning of prosperity , but , that no big city would ever be built on cattle trade . Eventually , the railroad would be extended , another railhead established . It so happened . The cattle boom gently collapsed , but farming was beginning to be important . and the railroad made it possible to get goods from the East for distribution . There was a good percentage of foreign-born among the early settlers , German farmers predom- ' inating . Today 98.1 per cent of the population of Wichita is American-born . Only in classrooms will you hear a foreign language spoken . You can live for years in the town without hearing even a foreign railroad tracks , and has an almost impertvptible upward etirve in the censer . " See ? " sup ; the salesninn . " She made it in high , without a murmur ! " The two rivets , when dry , are scar tissue on the face of the landscape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the property owners , because full nearly always means overflow . In 1920 the city was almost as devoid of desirable trees as it was in the beginning . There were cottonwoods and soft maples , both softwoods , short-lived on the average , and easy prey to windstorms . Upon the insistence of a newspaper , the city hired a forester , Alfred MacDonald , a ruddy Scotsman who thought he knew where certain improvements could be made . He was given dictatorial authority over trees , public and private , and over parks . He forbade the planting of any more cottonwoods or soft maples , cut down hundreds of them that were in bad condition , and replaced each one with a tree of good character . Fly over Wichita today , and , if suddenly waking from a pleasant nap , you 're apt. to think you 're looking down on the Green Forest . A recent tree survey showed 228,000 good , vigorous , well-cared-for , permanent shade trees of suitable varieties ; no cottonwoods or soft maples , no hanging limbs , no dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in parks ; nor does it include the 40,000 redbuds planted by school children , with approval of the forester . There was a man in the early days of the town who went about peddling soap and unctions which be mixed up in a pot at home . His name was A. A. Hyde , and he was poor , though his ancestors in Lee , Massachusetts , had been rich . He was of an old Congregational family , and missionary zeal was so rampant in his blood that you had to buy a bit of the Gospel when you bought an opal jar of his ointment . Around each jar was wound a leaflet concerning foreign missions and your duty thereto . Mr. Hyde made but little , but he gave nine tenths to the Lord . One of his nine children was heard to remark to his schoolmates that the family would eat better if the old man would be content with the customary one tenth for the Lord and nine for meat . As his sales grew , Mr. Hyde took a flier in real estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the custom during the real-estate boom , which had no apparent reason for being . He gave one large block of his land to the city , and it is one of the few small parks in the town today , quite properly called Hyde Park , and not after anything in London . Henry Schweiter was a pioneer from Switzerland , with a strong accent and a mania for economy in all things , who had a quarter section of good land a mile south of town . He planted acres of grapes from his native land , and made the best wine in Kansas , which he stored in great tune in a wine cellar far bigger than the house in which he reared , at low cost , his large family of gigantic sons . Kansas had prohibition in its constitution since 1880 , but Henry flashed his decayed teeth at all critics and said , - To hell ! I make all the wine I want ! " They could n't touch Henry . He was a pillar of the town , an enemy of all public spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running the town as he ran his farm , When a public library was proPooed , he rallied the support of the Taxpayers ' League , and emitted the elogan , " What do we want a library for ? For bums to loaf in and not pay taxes ' ? " Henry Schweiter gave to t he city a piece of land along the creek with many ancient . elms . 11. is now Linwood Park , one of the sylvan paradises of the town . In 1884 the canny Henry bought , from the Third Avenue Railway , in New York City , a flock of steam locomotives that had been pulling the wooden cars on the elevated lines in Manhattan . These smoke producers were put , to work to replace the mules that had been pulling Wichita streetcars . Schweiter built a suburban line , which was to carry passengers to and from a little station on the Santa Fe , south of Wichita , which was called , in the enthusiastic language of the boom builders , South Wichita . South Wichita did not materialize . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late ' 80 's , it went back to its old name , Greene 's Station , a flag stop . Greene 's Station remained a siding in a cow pasture , its little wooden depot boarded up , until the airplane boom of World War II . Then it became an important commuter suburb , opened up its depot and took back its hopeful name , South Wichita . It remains an important suburb , no longer remote from the busy city , whose expansion eventually will take it in . Corn , hogs and wheat succeeded Texas longhorns in supporting and nourishing the new city of Wichita . Soft wheat was raised in great quantities , but it could not compete on even terms , as a bread grain , with the hard wheat of the Dakotas and Minnesota . Mennonites , fleeing conscription in Russia , came to Kansas in 1874 , and settled in several parts of the state . They were Germans who had gone to Russia to escape German conscript ion , on the promise of Catherine the Great that they would not be compelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was up , and Kansas was the gainer . The first eight families of the Mennonite immigration brought with them two bushels of a hard wheat which they had been raising successfully in the dry plains country of the Ukraine . They had imported the original seed from Turkey , so the wheat was known as Turkey Red . It took a good many years for the two bushels to grow into sufficient seed wheat to affect the standing of Wichita as a grain and flour factor . By 1900 , however , when Wichita 's population had grown to 24,000 , Turkey Red had spread sufficiently to furnish grist for new flour mills that were springing up to supplant the old soft-wheat mills with stone rollers . Hard wheat , including strains developed by state and Federal agronomists from the Turkey Red , and by many considered superior to it in drought-resisting qualities , took over the acreage formerly devoted to soft wheat . In Kansas , wheat is planted in the fall , grows green all winter , and is harvested early in summer . Those imaginary tourists from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive the checkerboard roads around Wichita just before wheat harvest . The ocean of ripe wheat , in some cases extending to the horizon in every direction , billows beautifully before the strong winds , making a rustling sound that is music divine to the ear of the Kansan . Spotted through much of this ocean are oil derricks . Climb to the top of one of these and see the world 's bread on the heavily weighted stalk , bowing , bending , waving ; wealth before he eyes of the proud Kansans . The flour-milling business suffered from discriminatory tory freight rates . Wichita considers itaelf a traffic island , fight . ing always for freight rates , by train and I ruck , l , lint will permit it to compete with Kansas City and other river points , which are , at least theoretically , on navigable rivers that . could force the railroads to lower rates by encouraging water hauls . In the early days of Wichita 's battle for equitable freight rates , Wichita wheat could be shipped to Kansas City , milled there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millers at that point . In 1907 the Interstate Commerce Commission ended this injustice , and now Wichita has an edge of three and a half cents per hundredweight on flour , over Kansas City millers , in Galveston . Meat packing has taken on new life in Wichita since a decision by the ICC nearly three years ago , in the Westbound Meat Case . This decision , technical in detail , removed some of the inequalities in the shipment of Wichita 's animal products to the Far West . Day and night , year after year , a bureau set up by Wichita businessmen hired experts away from the railroads , studied freight-rate structures all over the country . and kept lobbyists in Washington . Congressmen were elected from the wheatfields to present Wichita 's case to the nation . Dogged persistence won many a battle . The fight still goes en , but the rugged individuals who would not give up to the railroads after having survived grasshoppers and tornadoes have proved that the town in the center of the map can manufacture not only flour but thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Detroit and Newark . Wichita still can not mill all the wheat that is produced in its trade territory , nor sell all the flour that is consumed there . But it does turn out in its three mills approximately 260,000 tons of flour annually . So unbelievably automatic has flour milling become that only 600 employees are required to operate the three mills . Oil and gas sent Wichita looping for a decade and a half . When the big boom subsided in the 1930 's , it left a residue of wealth that sought investment at home , and that has n't been bad for the town . After the sensational rise of Tulsa , not so far to the south , there was a constant undercurrent of oil excitement in Wichita . A small club of Wichita businessmen liked to shoot **28;3209;TOOLONG **34;3239;TOOLONG , to shoot quail , but clay pigeons were fair game , and polite . The boys called themselves the Trapshooters Club . The first World War was just breathing its last when the Trapshooters yielded to confident pleas of the farmer who owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a company to drill for oil . The farmer showed the boys plenty of oil on the surface of a pond , but such " farmers ' oil " is not rare anywhere in Kansas . The well came in , a tremendous gusher . It was known as Trapshooters Number One . Trapshooters was to shed .1 great light on Broadway . Marcellus Men dock , publisher of the Wichita Eagle , inherited from his father , Marsh Mur. dock , took a trip to New York on some of his first easy oil money . There he met his cousin , Brock Pemberton , also from Kansas . Brook showed the newly rich oil man the script of a play , and swore that he could produce it successfully if he could get hold of $20,000 . Marcellus advanced the money in return for a major portion of the stock . The play , produced in 1920 , was Enter Madame , almost as good as an oil welt Thus Murdock became Broadway 's first butter-and-egg man from the sticks . Fields have come and gone since then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few miles of Wichita . Derricks stand , pumps running , in the heart of aristocratic Eastborough , one of the more prosperous residential suburbs of Wichita . Oil fields in the producing stage now completely surround the city , and many authorities feel certain that the derricks will march right into the town , as they did in Oklahoma City . Five major pools are now within ten miles of the heart of Wichita . Though Wichita can not hope to rival Tulsa as an oil center , it is the hub of the oil-and-gas activity for Kansas , fifth state in petroleum production . The wild days of the 1920 's are , a by-product of the search for oil , is also extremely important . It is the answer to the question , asked by almost every visitor , " Why is this town , with so many factories , so clean and smokeless ?

Ankt , Moellendick was n tool dresser in the El Dorado ? pronounced El-doray-do  --  field . Tool dressers were getting as much as fifteen dollars a day , mid Jake was a thrifty Dutchman . When he had saved a few hundred dollars , Jake knew where to invest it in royalties . But he was essentially an adventurer , in pioneer , which means , always , a gambler . He stnrted out to find new fields . Jake was in Parsons , away out on the eastern frontier of Kansas , his nose to the ground , seeking oil . A wire from one of his scouts reported that a strike had been made in wildcat territory in the western part of the state . Jake wanted to get to that strike , and now . He had seen an old Army Jenny barnstorming around the town . He visited the alfalfa patch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laird whether he would or could fly him to the oil strike , about 200 miles away . Yes , said Matty , and they were off . Jake had never been in the air before . He was so impressed with the speed of flight in t his old coffin that he bought the plane and pilot out of band before they landed at the oil well . Jake knew he was going to make money on this deal . He bought up all the acreage for miles around 1 he new well , and asked Matty what he would like most in the world . Matty said he would like to quit barnstorming and design and build a plane . Thus was born the Laird Swallow , one of the best commercial airplanes of the early era . The factory was a shed on a piece of pasture east of Wichita . The Swallow actually flew , and Jake Moellendick was proud . He began spending his oil winnings on airplanes . Eventually he quarreled with Laird , and there was a split-up . When Jake was at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . might fly anywhere . It was the Dallas Spirit , designed for competition in the Dole race to Hawaii , but not quite ready when the flight started . At the end of the race the Spirit took off on a search and rescue flight . Ship and crew of two were lost at sea . Jake literally went crazy , worrying about his responsibility for the tragedy . He retired from business , spent years in a rest home , and died , old , defeated , penniless . In the plant that Jake started , a young engineer , Walter Beech , piled up experience , then started out on his own . Beechcraft , is now one of the larger factories . At least a score of plants made as many different kinds of machines for flying , in the height of the prewar aviation boom . There are now fourteen landing fields immediately adjacent to the city . In addition , there is the Municipal Airport , around which cluster many of the large factories . It ie one of the best in the country ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because . the B-29 's were flown from it and to it The big Boeing plant beside the airport built 40 per cent of the B-29'e . At the height of the war building , Wichita factories employed nearly 60 , - 000 persons in the airplane industry . Most of them were farmers , and wives , sons and daughters of farmers , who let their land go to weeds or rented it out for trailer camps while they pitched in to accomplish victory . They worked long hours steadily , with no absentee problem , and preyed to be about the beat hands any factory could find . When the war ended , many of the farmers went back to their hums , and the city 's Ilapalal ion shrank by shout . 14,000 . However , the town is still so crowded Ihal demolition of t he " temporary " housing built by the Federal Government for airplane workers is constant ly postponed . A great deal of jerry-building under private enterprise has sprung up to hike care of the housing emergency . Unemployment has increased rapidly since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 11,000 persons are on relief  --  Federal , stale and county . The annual cost of relief , thus shared , is $4,500,000 , approximately what , it costs to run the entire city government and all its services . There has been a remarkable comeback in industrial activity , however , since the first impact of technical peace hit the town . The airplane factories , which produced 10 per cent of the nation 's planes with approximately 3 per cent of the labor personnel , have settled down , but not sunk . The Boeing , Beech and Cessna plants have continued to turn out planes and plane parts . Boeing , by far the largest of the plants , has produced no airplanes , except one type for the Army , in small quantity . But it is kept in operation , two shifts a day , with a total of 1400 employees , producing parts for the new Army maintenance schedules . It also does overhauling of planes previously built in its plants . The Cessna plant continues to make planes , at the rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than $16,000,000 worth of planes since the war . Beech , producing commercial and personal planes that seem to he in demand , has done a business of close to $3,000,000 a month . Ingenuity , cheap gas and oil , and necessity have put many returning servicemen and many former airplane workers into business . One returned soldier , finding no job , designed an awning for the front windows of automobiles . He patented it , fitted it , in gay colors , upon I he cars of his friends , and now does a roaring summer business keeping I he hot sunlight out of t lie faces of motorists . A flaming sword of the Gowel in the early days , along with A. A. Hyde , already mentioned , was W. C. Coleman , now seventy-seven years old , and active manager of one of the most prosperous factories in town . He is a benevolent gentleman , liberal in gifts to all Baptist enterprises , manufacturer and purveyor of light for those who dwell in darkness . You ca n't get far enough into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coleman gasoline-gas lamps , stoves , heaters , furnaces or what . not . At least a hundred kinds of farm machinery and implements are made in this town that used to have to buy all its farm equipment from distant states . There are harvesters , fertilizer distributors , grain elevators , saddles , trucks , grain crackers , generating plants , poultry pickers , wagon hoists , hydraulic loaders for handling hay and grain , processing machinery for handling alfalfa , and innumerable other items  --  all made without smoke or dirt in this strange town of the plains , where , the experts said , there could never be any manufacturing . Handling more broomcorn than any other city , Wichita makes brooms of many kinds , Out-of-doors broilers occupy much of the attention of at least three factories .

There are special schools for Negroes up to high school . No other discrimination is noticeable to the naked eye . There is no Jim Crow law , but the black people , mindful of the customs just a few miles farther south , generally take the rear seats on busses , and there is no rioting or public outcry on the color question . The police are generally more efficient than in most cities . They are uniformed to suit the climate , not at all in ordinary police tradition . The summer uniform is a light khaki , coatless , neat , and always clean and pressed . There are only 186 employees in the police department , mostly young , tall , smart-looking men  --  the tallest , I think , of any police force I have seen . Salaries are not big . The chief of police gets $440 a month . The city manager , a remarkably efficient and intelligent young , ratan named Russell McClure , gets only a little more than $9000 a year . Graft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the old days , when gangsters and highwaymen were granted asylum in Wichita , provided they kept the town itself crime-less and made their livings preying upon neighboring communities and robbing trains as far away as Nebraska . There are five city commissioners , all serving for the nominal salary of $200 a year . They are usually prominent businessmen who consider it an honor to serve the citizens for such pay . The office of mayor is unimportant . The mayor is merely the chairman of the commission . The office rotates , year by year , and few citizens ever remember which of the commissioners is mayor at any particular time . Prohibition and the liquor problem are permanent worries for most citizens and all law-enforcement agencies . Kansas has absolute prohibit ion in its constitution . Contrary to the stories you hear from Eastern traveling men , there is no law against cigarettes , except that they may not be sold to minors . There has never been , in Kansas , a law against smoking . There was , for some years , a law against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarettes v ere always on sale , and the law was abolished quietly many years ago . It is against the law in Wichita to dress or undress a mannequin in any store window , unless curtains are drawn to shut out the public view . This law , sponsored by former Commissioner Henry J. Roetrel , retired wheat farmer and battler for righteousness , has been on the honks in force so long that it has been forgotten by the police department , and nowadays one may occasionally see a half-draped figure in a depart nentssLore indow . It is to be observed , ho ' ever , that the lady models , whether of wood or plastic . always are provided with discreet undergarments  --  out of respect , I suppose , to the memory of the late Mr. Hoetiel and supporters . Alt hough there ate no public liquor bars , there are fur more private bars per unit of Wichita population than I have ever seen in New York , It is impossible to cite slat Lilies on this quest ion , since everything is hush-hush . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquor plays a larger part in the lives of important people in Wichita than it does elsewhere in the nation . The Wichita Beacon , evening gaily , is openly out for repeal of the prohihiLion clause in the constitution . Under the ownership of Henry .1 . Allen , former governor and United States Senator , the Beacon had carried the harmer of prohibition for many yearn , Then the Levand brothers , fresh out of Denver , became the publishers of the paper , and in due course changed its stand on the liquor question . There is no person of school age in Wichita who can not read and write English  --  not one . Illiteracy ceased to be a matter of census report many years ago , because there were and are no illiterate persons . This would have amazed and pleased my father , who got off the rode under the freight car in the first paragraph , for he could not read or write in any language .

The school has been for fifty years an important force in breaking down barriers of prejudice ; Jews , Negroes and Orientals are at home on the campus , equally with Catholics , and Protestants of all denominations . The University of Wichita , a municipal institution , was built upon the ruins of a small religious college . It has 3000 students in four colleges  --  liberal arts , fine arts , business and education . There are twelve modern red-brick buildings on the eighty-four-acre campus . One of these is occupied by a research foundation supported by industrialists of the town . There are wind tunnels , testing laboratories , experimental shops , for working out specific problems of Wichita 's industries . The local dailies have a combined circulation of approximately 213,000 , and you must remember that the present population is only 196,000 .

One final example : Ted Wells is an airplane designer and engineer . He had never seen or smelled salt water , except for a whitf from a New Orleans hotel room , until the spring of 1947 , when he sailed in the national snipe-boat races at Marblehead , Massachusetts , in competition with men who had been doing this sort of thing all their lives , A snipe boat is always exactly fifteen and a half feet long , five feet in the beam , and twenty inches deep , with 116 feet of sail . Wells , a Kansas farm boy , learned to sail on Santa Fe Lake , about the most dismal fresh-water pond you ever saw , east of Wichita . The Wichita Sailing Club has thirty-six members , and learns sailing the hard way . The wind blows so heartily that many boats are blown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore , and some are overturned and sunk . But there goes modest Mr. Wells , away out in front of the Marblehead fishermen and sailors , fearing the choppy Atlantic , but heading into it , as he had headed into so many storms on Santa Fe Lake .
