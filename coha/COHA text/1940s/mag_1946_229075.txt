The decision to do so-one of the gravest ever made by American statesmen-was taken for two reasons . It was made necessary by the competition between the Soviet and Western systems which is now going on all over the world . It was precipitated by Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov 's statement to the Foreign Ministers ' meeting in Paris on July 14 , which first disclosed Soviet purposes beyond any possibility of doubt . <P> " The great American decision must be understood as a direct , unavoidable response to Soviet policy in Germany .
