txt City 's Meat ' Quota Lifted ; Critical Shortage Grows OPA Authorizes Shipment of 1,000,000 Pounds More Beef as Mayor Certifies to Its Need to Maintain Health and Morale Federal authorities authorized the shipment of an additional 1 , - 000,000 pounds of meat to New York City yesterday after Mayor La Guardia had certified that the shortage was so critical as to endanger public health and morale as well as war work . Shipments are expected to begin arriving here , Monday . " By a happy coincidence , " according to the Office of Price Administration , Wilson &; Co. , packers , have " a new supply of meat " to aid New York . In moving to relieve the meat crisis here the Food Distribution Administration stipulated that all areas facing such emergencies should have equal treatment . This led to the supposition that Pacific Coast areas that have been meatless for weeks , Boston and Philadelphia would get relief if the municipal authorities should certify the existence of grave shortages . As spokesmen for the food trade pointed out that the 1,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like giving " the needle to a dying man , " New Yorkers who faced the prospects of a meatless week-end continued their scramble for every available bit of meat in sight . While most shops were bare , a few were well stocked , but the crowds were so dense at the meat counters that some customers waited for hours to make purchases . In some sections of the city/ processions formed behind meat trucks en route to shops . Mayor La Guardia announced that the OPA , under Amendment 18 , had authorized Wilson &; Co. , packers , to increase the supply of beef for the civilian population of New York . " I am happy to be able to anpounce , " the Mayor said , " that due to the cooperation , understanding and quick action of the OPA , New York City will get an additional supply to meet the present emergency . " Neither local spokesmen for the Food Distribution Administration , the Army Quartermaster Market Center , the Meat Institute , OPA , the City Department of Markets , nor Wilson &; Co. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " new supply " of meat was coming from . It could not be ascertained whether it was to " be released from supplies earmarked for the armed forces , lend-lease , etc. , or whether it would be freshly slaughtered and shipped here . The Mayor 's Announcement " Mr. Sylvan Joseph , regional director of the OPA , " Mayor La Guardia announced , " informed me that they are putting into motion machinery under Amendment No. 18 , which authorizes slaughterers to increase civilian deliveries of meat in areas where acute shortages endanger public health , morale or the war effort . " At this very moment Wilson &; Co. have been authorized to increase deliveries for civilian use by 1,000,000 pounds of beef . " The retailers will get it at the present prices . There should be no reason for an increase in the cost of the beef over and above the ceiling prices of stores . " Mr. La Guardia explained that Markets Commissioner Daniel . P. Woolley had conferred all day Friday with local OPA authorities in an effort to ease the critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour or so and ought to be here Monday , " the Mayor declared . E. S. Ferguson , regional OPA rationing executive , pointed out that while the 1,000,000 pounds of meat would begin moving into this city on Monday , it would not all immediately become available , but would require several days to move through the usual channels of distribution . The calls for relief , according to Mr. Ferguson , came first from the Municipal authorities . He said it was purely coincidental that Wilson &; Co. at the same time disclosed that a large supply of livestock had become available . " The company asked the OPA , " he said , " if the slaughter quotas could not be lifted so that this new source of supply could be distributed . In the specific case of Wilson &; Co. we agreed to lift the quota after consultation with the Food Distribution Administration and conferences with rationing chiefs in Washington who granted the regional administrator the power to invoke this emergency measure . " It was a happy coincidence that this new supply of meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the municipal authorities in this area . " Mr. Ferguson indicated that steps to relieve other areas were being taken when he said : " The decision on granting these powers depends entirely on the acuteness of the situation and can not be taken until conferences with the municipal authorities , the FDA , and local OPA officers have agreed on the gravity of the situation . " Mr. Ferguson explained that begining on April 1 , the United States Department of Agriculture , instead of OPA , would have jurisdiction over slaughter quotas . He emphasized that the quota on slaughtering had been lifted specifically in the case of Wilson &; Co. and that this had been done only after this area had been deemed a distress section and because the company had meat . Mr. Joseph 's version of the steps taken to ease New York City 's hunger for meat was released in the followine , formal statement : " OPA regulations provide that if certification is made by civil authorities that a certain area is in a critical situation because of a food shortage such certification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the procedure followed in the case of New York City where Mayor La Guardia certified that a shortage of meat had caused a situation dangerous to public morale and health and to the war effort . " With Washington approval the slaughtering quota or this area was ordered increased by approximately 1,000,000 pounds . Sufficient meat was located in the Midwest and emergency arrangements were made with Wilson &; Co. to slaughter and to get the meat to New York . " Every effort is being made to . assure the distribution of this meat for home consumption . ? Commissioner Daniel P. Woolley of New York City Department of Markets , is cooperating in this effort . " This strictly ? emergency action will mean , of course , some temporary relief for the meat consumers of New York City , but it can not be construed as assuring a full ration allowance for every one in the present shortage crisis . " A spokesman for the Food Distribution Administration explained that " the FDA has arranged with Wilson &; Co. to have the meat distributed to civilians through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city 's critical meat shortage as Mr. Woolley released his weekly survey of retail food prices and supplies showing that red meat supplies had dropped from last week 's record low to where only 14 per cent of the shops had sufficient supplies compared with 18 Per cent ? the preceding week and 43 per cent last month . In the kosher meats there was also a drop , with only 11 per cent of the shops adequately supplied as against 26 per cent last week . Prices for beef , except kosher , generally were lower than last week , according to Mr. Woolley . The report disclosed a slight improvement in supplies of live and fresh-killed poultry , with price increases of 2 to 3 cents a pound . A sharp drop in kosher provisions was reported . Non-kosher delicatessen supplies also are still very low , but prices are steady , according to the Markets Commissioner 's report . " Last week 's receipts of fish were heavier , with prices slightly lower , " the report added .
