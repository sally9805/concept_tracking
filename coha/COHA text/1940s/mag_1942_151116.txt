Crashing south toward Singapore , the Jap had more than the glory of the Mikado to drive him on . He was in a desperate race with time , and if he could not beat the hands of the clock , his push to the strategic hub of the Far East was going to be a historic failure . <P> For just to the right of his soft rump lay Burma ( see map , and Burma was still in British control . <P> The Jap recognized the danger . He stabbed at Rangoon with his bombers , with the dual purpose of knocking out Allied aircraft and smashing the supply depots for the Burma Road . He missed the Chinese Army 's supplies , dissipated his effort . There was a reason : U.S. pilots met him . <P> On Burma 's west coast lies a long chain of flying fields , all the way back to Calcutta and beyond . By this route new planes were coming to be added to Burma 's thin complement of bombers and U.S.-made fighters . The Allies raided Bangkok , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airfields , riddling their ground establishments . In one raid near week 's end , returning pilots reported they had smashed up 27 Jap planes , mostly bombers , on the ground . <P> If this kind of slashing could be stepped up , the Japs down the peninsula would have plenty to worry about . <P> For one of the most vital jobs in the Far Eastern Theater , the Allies got two new , relatively young commanders . Posted to command of Burma was Lieut . General Thomas Jacomb Hutton , a 51-year-old , crop-mustached professional who was wounded three times in World War I , has since got the reputation of being one of the finest strategists in the British Army . <P> Burma 's Air Force also got a new commander : 46-year-old Air Vice Marshal Donald Fasken Stevenson . Onetime commander of a bombing outfit in the United Kingdom , Marshal Stevenson is a field-educated flying man , has battle-trained flying men to command - not yet nearly enough of them . <P> But against time and distance Thomas Hutton and Donald Stevenson had to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look to the west and north for more . Down from China marched troops from Chiang Kai-shek 's Army . The defenders of the Far East could only hope that many more reinforcements of men and planes were coming from the west . <P> If enough should arrive in time , General Hutton might well cut across into Thailand after the Jap . But it was more easily said than done , even with a big force . Thailand and Burma have long been uppity neighbors . Their railroad and highway systems do not mesh , and the border country is mountainous , wild and miasmic in the low places . Yet Germany in Greece and Japan in Malaya have shown that an army with the will and equipment can traverse any kind of country , fighting as it goes . Up-to-snuff military men like General Hutton must have profited from their examples .
