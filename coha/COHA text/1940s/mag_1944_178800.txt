A portable , one-man weapon that fires a whopping 4.5-inch , three-foot-long projectile was described by the Army last week . It is the M-12 , a bazooka-like rocket launcher consisting of a factory-loaded plastic tube and tripod , weighing 35 Ibs. in all . A one-shot piece designed for close-range use , it is fired by dry-cell batteries , is replaced forthwith by a new barrel ; the empty goes to the rear for a new loading . By a wire hookup , several M-12s can be fired at once by the same gunner .
