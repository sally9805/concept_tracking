( See Cover ) <P> This was the Ukraine in spring : sparkling puddles , shell craters , blistered , blackened tanks , the sullen stench of battle and unburied soldiers . Along the muddy roads , Red Army tractors tugged at stalled trucks and mired cannon . Red artillerymen whipped their foamy horses . Red cavalrymen trotted briskly through the muck , bespattering weary , sweating infantrymen on the way to another battle . <P> No one looked upon the carnage . It was an old sight . It had been thus at Stalingrad and Kursk , at Kiev and Gomel ; it was the Red artillery 's savage imprint . <P> It was the work of that man Voronov . <P> The Decision . Years ago Nikolai Nikolayevich Voronov , Chief Marshal of Red Artillery , a giant of a man with the soul of a great professional soldier , had staked his reputation and his country 's fate on the cannon . German generals , whom he would ultimately fight , went in for newer-fangled things . They built their army around the team of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For five months the Germans moved with wondrous speed and dazzling power . Stubborn Voronov stuck to his artillery . There came a time when the Wehrmacht 's great blitzkrieg machine stood at the gates of Leningrad , Stalingrad , the Caucasus . Voronov still stuck to his artillery . <P> What was going on this week along the vast Russian front was final proof that Voronov was right-for Russia . The specific proof was that the Red Army , spearheaded by the greatest concentration of artillery ever gathered on any front , was winning . Voronov 's bludgeon had beaten down the German 's rapier ; the might of other elements of the Russian Army was trampling it in the mud . <P> Artilleryman 's Progress . At his headquarters , the giant smiled ; there was no substitute for cannon . He read the reports streaming in , studied maps , made plans for new action . He was in rare humor . <P> Twenty-six years earlier-a broad-shouldered , barrel-chested youngster-he had joined the Red Army . He was 18 , spoiling for a fight , devoted to Bolshevism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starved , earned a decoration . <P> He was blue-eyed and blond . He was a growth from Russia 's rich soil-earthy , sturdy , solid in mind and body . His open face was typically Russian , as was his name ( voron means raven ) . A big man , he liked big , sturdy things . On Russia 's battlefields he saw guns in action : he liked them . <P> When the civil war died down , Voronov turned to artillery . He went to artillery schools , elementary and high ; commanded an artillery regiment ; directed an artillery school ; headed a corps . <P> At 38 Voronov became boss of Red artillery . This was 1937-the year of the great Army purge , of unease and turbulence . Mikhail Tukhachevsky had been " liquidated , " and his death left a vacuum in leadership and military thought . Unostentatiously , Voronov moved into the gap . He tightened discipline , increased the number of artillery schools , devised a new system of training , opened special schools for cannon-struck youngsters .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
