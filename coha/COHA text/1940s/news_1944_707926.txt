They are Transportation : This provided the first spur to the little village located where the Chickagou ( Wild Onion  --  some say that 's where the ? ity 's name can from , River ran Into Lake Michigan . As the West began to open up . travelers and goods headed for tl:r Northwest had to go down around Lake Michigan Then a southern army engineer .

Today , Chicago has 90.5 miles of lakefront , 52 of them equipped with dock and rail facilities Chicago has become the hub of American railroads , too It s where the eastern and western lines meet . Twenty-two trunk line railroads enter the city Every day the Chicago Switching District normally handles as mien fi eight as New York and St. Louis combined Its lake location , of course , has meant much to Chicago . Down it move the ion ore from the great Mesabi range , to be made into steel in this city and at the nearby GaryIndiana Harbor-East Chicago mills . Steel production capacity of the Chicago area is fourfifths as great as the huge Pittsburgh steel center . Farm Area Center : Surrounding the city within a radius of 400 miles is 85,4 , of the nation 's richest farmland . From this section conies one-thirc of the nation 's butter , twothirds of its cheese , soybeans and corn products , half the evaporated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a fifth of the canned and otherwise processed fruits and vegetables . A substantial section of Chicago 's Industry is built around this faint business . The city , for instance , has 43 meat packing plants . 53 fruit and vegetable processors . 20 soap makers and 81 paint , pigment and varnish factories i using vegetable oils I , and the country 's leading farm equipment producers Type of Workers : Factory managers of ' this area like to talk of the growing fourth ! generation Of workers handy with tools . The Chamber of Commerce has a talking point , too , in the generally prevailing labor peace While the memory of the Haymarket riot and the Pullman strike of former years still persists , labor and management get along well in this city . This is true despite a relatively high percentage of foreign born population . After counting 945.000 native American whites and 234,000 negroes , census takers find 400,000 Poles , 380.000 Germans . 195,000 Irish , 181.000 Italians , 170,000 Russians . 140,000 Swedes and 125.000 Czechs . In addition to these favorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the presence of plenty of water . ' so necessary to many present day industrial processes Lake Michigan provides an Inexhaustible supply .

This huge output followeear decade in which Chicago had been slipping industrially . The value of its menutfactured goods in 1940 was $4 2 billion , compared with $5 5 billion in 1930 .

Chicago has played an important role in distribution of goods to consumers The great mail order firms of Sears . Roebuck and Montgomery Ward are part of one major phase of this job Another is this city 's Merchandise Mart , which only recently gave up the title of world 's largest building to the Army 's Pentagon Building in Washington .

Type of Leadership On the basis then of this deeply zooted industrial production and trade , ' Chicago is planning is business future . Some people complain that there is n't the brilliantly ruthless civic leadership provided in bygone days by meat-packing empire builders , and such ? men as George M. Pullman who revoluI lionized railroal riding . But others point to the recent example of Sewell Avery in the Montgomery Ward case and to the many ideas sparked off by President Robert St Hutchins of the University of Chicago . Quiet leadership comes , too , from such nationally known bankers as Walter Cummings and ; Edward Eagle Brown , ( the only banker who is a delegate to the Bretton Woods nionetar ) . conference ) . People wonder whether " Young ' Marshall Field , who recently turned 50. will begin to help build Chicago . as his grand ' father did with the retail store known the world around . 1 Business officials here are occupied with peacetime plans for their own concerns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clough , president of Abbott Laboratories , which has become one of the nation 's largest pharmaceutical concerns . Om the Thursday after Pearl Harbor Sunday Mr. Clough got his directors to authorize the beginning of post-war planning for the company . The work is being done by 17 committees covering every phase of the concern 's business : their goal is an annual sales volume of $50 million by 1950 City 's Post-War Planning Officially the city 's plans are in the hands of a triple-headed drive under direction of Mayor Edward Kelly He uses the Chicago Planning Commission . City Commissioner Philip Harrington . and a recently appointed Economic Advisory Council . They have before them the example of the Dan Burnham plan put forth in 1909 by the great architect who was largely responsible for the Columbian exposition of 1893 . ( Chicagoans say they got the name of Windy , City from New York then , as an epithet of disgust which New York , the loser , applied to the orations of Chicagoans who persuaded Congress to locate the world fair here . ) Mr. Burnhali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , landscaping and beautiful drives , it was converted into a lovely playground instead of an industrial eyesore . Mayo/ Reny bears down on the need of post-war housing He proposes to clear the slums of downtown Chicago of 241,000 houses . to thin out 108.000 middle . aged dwellings movang into obsolescence , and to build 500,000 new homes in 25 years , with 35,000 to 40.000 a year going up in the half doeen years right after the the war . " A city , rebuilding program on a planned basis by private interests aided by public agencies is good business because it pays , " says the mayor . " It pays because it helps invest city living with a whole new quality of attractivem sa and thus people who today leave the city for the tree-lined neighborhoods of the suburbs will tomorrow find those neighborhoods right here , within easy distance of the Loop and their places of employment " The Planning Commission has studied every one of the city 's , 20,000 blocks , and its program . endorsed by the mayor , provides for taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for curving streets and dead-end ones with parking space ; doing away with alleys and setting up playgrounds . The Post-War Building Program The official post-war program contemplates the spending of $1,266.631.000 dollars . principally divided as follows ' For new water filtration plants , mains and pumps , $140 mullion . For new airports and small parks , S49 million For boulevards and park development , $7 million . For subways and superhighways , $451 million For new and remodeled schools d school additions , $24 million . For sewage disposal plants , $235 mul-lion For slum clearance and housing , $106 million . For a new central railway terminal , $75 million . ( No one thinks it will come quickly . ) For planting new trees , $5 million . To pay for this ( aside from what Federal help r .. ay be had i Chicago has been slowly , improving her ei condition . bonded debt of Chicago 's various governmental ' ) oclies reached a high in 1936 of $473 million . Since then it has been dropping , to $414 million ' In 1935 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; $353 million in 1941 ; $330 million in 1942 ; 8305 million in 1943 . Delinquent taxes are a blot , however : they totaled $530 million in 1942 . The assessor gave taxpayers a bombshell when he decreed , last year , for a pi operty valuation of 100el. , instead of the former 37%* adjusted value ; the principal danger is that this raises statutory debt limitations to a possible $294 million in addition to presently , outstanding debt , a temptation to publics money spenders . The city 's adjusted UM rate in 1942 was $38,55 per $1,000 of values tion , exceeded only by Boston 's $41 . Chicago has gone along , however , without a city sales tax , cigarette tax , or any other of the money raising dodges other cities have resorted to , and none are planned .
