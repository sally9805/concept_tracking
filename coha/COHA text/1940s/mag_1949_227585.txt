If folk music is the good earth from which much great music springs , the U.S. has a rich subsoil . But little has been cultivated outside the jazz patch , and the U.S. opera crop has been especially sparse . Last week a foreign-born U.S. composer proclaimed that the soil was ready to bear , if only U.S. composers would work it . He offered a piece of his own produce to prove his point . <P> Down in the Valley , a one-act " folk opera " by Composer Kurt Weill and Librettist Arnold Sundgaard , had become a sensational hit on the campus theater circuit all over the U.S. Written a year ago , it had already had some 80 separate productions . Last week its latest one was the biggest hit in the three-year history of Manhattan 's zestful Lemonade Opera company . <P> The opera house , a church basement in Greenwich Village , was sold out for nearly a week in advance . Said the manager : " We 're swamped . " Said Weill , who has already made $2,000 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies all over the country which are crying for just this sort of thing ... If I had three of these one-act operas to make a full evening 's entertainment , they would make a living for both composer and librettist . " <P> B.W. Loves J.P . Weill intends to write them soon , and a full-length opera as well , all based on U.S. folk tales and tunes . He thinks there is plenty of material for others to follow suit . " The trick , " he says , " is to write them so nonprofessional groups can do them . " <P> Down in the Valley is made to that measure . No scenery is needed , and fewer than a dozen singers , none of whom needs any great vocal range or agility . The story is pathetic enough to sluice any church basement with tears . Brack Weaver loves Jennie Parsons . Her father wants her to pay attention to Thomas Bouch , who has him on a financial hook . Jennie refuses . Bouch pulls a knife on Brack . Brack kills him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his last hours with Jennie , then goes dutifully back to die . <P> Some customers feel that the libretto should have been poured over a waffle instead of an audience , but most of them like Weill 's witty , musicianly development of the folk themes ( Down in the Valley , <P> Sourwood Mountain , Hop Up , My Ladies ) . And critics agree that he has shown how to grow native opera-even if it is only small-potato-size opera . <P> Only Twelve Tones . " Everything I have done so far has been working toward this , " Kurt Weill said last week . Everything began for him in Dessau , Germany . Townspeople soon knew that the little boy , whose huge eyes and rudimentary physique gave him somewhat the look of a tadpole , was already composing music . At 13 , he wrote his first opera . At 18 , he went to Berlin to study with Engelbert Humperdinck ( Hansel and Gretel ) , that same year became conductor of the opera at the small town of Ldenscheid . <P> The famed pianist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied , gave him some basic advice that he has followed ever since : " Do n't be afraid of banality . After all , there are only twelve tones in the scale . "
