common multitude ? Or was he a superior being ? How did he pass his little days ? Did he fritter away his days climbing the stupid ladder of success ? Or did he live ? Whom did he love ? And then I wonder  --  will some Don Quixote of the future sit on my tombstone ? Will he try to imagine what I was like ? Will he try to reconstruct a sense of my life , my personality ? " " I do n't want to think about such things now . I do n't want to think of you dead . " " Falling in love , when one has the capacity to feel , tends to make a person cogitate about such questions . " It was disgusting to think that some day she and he would have to die . She wanted them to be always young . " What is love ? " he asked , as if the question were addressed as much to himself as to her . She did not answer .

Or is it something finer ? " His moods and his conversation were so bewildering . A momentago she had been dancing in his arms , feeling his body close to hers . That was part of their love . It was a promise of the future fullness of their love . Tonight they would answer his question , but not with mere words . Now she did not speak . She would be cautious , because she wanted to agree with him and she wanted to say whatever he would like to hear . Before meeting him , she had been cynical about the very word love . It had seemed silly to her . Now she was too happy to express her feelings to herself or to concern herself with the effort of trying to analyze them . Love , at this very minute , was whatever he wanted it to be , whatever he wanted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became more fascinating . She was attracted to him more strongly . Tonight he and she would know love . That was more important than talking about it , even when one talked as he did. pIOI " Do you think that I am foolish in asking you such a ques-tion ? " " Ed , you know I do n't . " " If love is purely physical , what 's the use ? Then it is merely a matter of a few moments of sensation , and that is all . " She had an impulse to tell him that that was what she had thought of love so often when she had been with men . But she did n't say it . It might be dangerous to let him know that she had let herself be an easy mark . " Ellen , I am a romantic . " Her face melted with affection . " What are you thinking about , Ellen ? " " I was thinking  --  I am a romantic , too . " " Do you think that I would be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a romantic ? " " I 've always been romantic , " she said thoughtfully . Then she spoke more rapidly . " That 's why I 've always been so restless , so unhappy . Ed , before I met you , I was n't happy . I was bored most of the time . I did n't know why . Now I do . I was searching . I was searching , but I did n't know what I was looking for . " " It was the Unattainable , " he said profoundly . She nodded , her eyes lighting with agreement and recognition . " The essential characteristic of the romantic is that he seeks the Unattainable along the highways and byways of the world . He is always traveling toward the mirage on the far horizon . He is embarked on an endless quest , and for what ? The most important object of desire in life . The beauty of the will-o ' - the- wisp . But he is doomed never to find that . " He paused before changing to a lighter tone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to finding the Unattainable . " " Of course , I do n't express myself as well as you . But I feel the same way you do . You have given me the words that describewhat life means to me , Ed , darling . Since I met you , I feel that I 've become a different person . I feel so differently  --  about everything . I do n't feel restless , empty now , the way I used to . I do n't go around saying to myself all day that life is so stupid . That 's the way I used to feel . " " I am glad to hear this . But at the same time you must be careful . The kind of contentment you describe can be double-edged . It can be a warning signal . " " Why ? " she asked apprehensively . Ed lit a cigarette . Calmly , he delayed his answer in a telling pause . She waited , anxious . " The moment we lose our desire for the Unattainable , that moment we lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this desire , because we love the beautiful will-o ' - the- wisp , that our souls are filled with rebellion against the drab , the paltry , the stupidities of the common herd . If we allow ourselves to becomecontented we sink back into the sloughs of common humanity . " He became stern . " Do you want that to happen ? " " I 'll never let it happen to me . Why , I 'd even kill myself before it did . " " Ellen , we 're kindred spirits . " She showered a smile of gratitude on him and allowed her knees to touch his under the table . She glanced toward the orchestra , anxious for more music so that she could lose herself in his arms , in motion with him , in common sensations . But the orchestra had not returned . " And , Ellen , " he went on . " We are going to make our life together into a poem , a poem that is strong , beautiful , sad . " " But why must it be sad ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If love is to be mere joy and ecstasy , then it must remain childish . We do n't want our love to be childish . " " Of course not . We 're not children . . . . Ed , I 'm not a child , " she said , speaking softly , slowly , striving to tell him with her words , her eyes , the very tone of her voice , that with her he need not be shy or hesitant . She stirred in her chair . " There is something exceptional about you . Of course , you are beautiful . You have fine eyes . You have exceptional quali/ties . But I have in mind something special about you that strikes me . " " Ed , darling , you make me out to be so much more than I really am . But I 'll try , I 'll try to live up to your opinion of me . I 'll try ! " " You need not try . I do not idealize the female of the species . I know better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped remarks which seemed like hints , frightening warnings . She was already convinced that he possessedremarkable insight and was sharply observant . She was almost frightened because of this conviction . Ellen squashed the half-smoked cigarette in an ash tray . She patted her hair . " Yes , I am amazed to find you so different from what one would expect from a girl of your background . I 've met a number of them , St. Paul girls and others . You do n't seem to come from their world . You come from a world of strangeness . Why , to meet you is like coming face-to-face with a girl I have read about in an exquisite poem . To look at you in the flesh is to look at a girl I have seen painted in a fine picture . My Sweet , you are like meeting a girl of far-flung dreams . " " Ed , you say such wonderful things . " " Do n't you believe that I mean them ? " he asked , a slightly harsh note creeping into his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , squeezed it tightly . " Ed , when you talk to me , I realize so many things about myself . You know , I never felt close to the girls at school . I never felt that I was like them . When I would hear their silly talk about dates , dances , their sororities that I always refused to join , their boys , I always felt that they were so childish , so young . " " You are different . I 've known a number of girls , so many that before I met you I had become a misogynist . " It was unbearable to think that he had known other girls , talked to them , kissed them , petted them . She hated all the unknown girls of his past.  | She glanced again toward the orchestra dais . The musicians were returning . " Ed , let 's dance . " " I would prefer to sit this dance out and to talk to you . " " We can talk while we dance . " " No , let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mood . " She said nothing . He calmly lit a cigarette . She lit one , and again she puffed rapidly . " Ed , tell me about the girls you 've known . " " Why speak of such trivialities ? It is all so inconsequential . Why even bore oneself with insignificant episodes from the past ? All that does not matter , because now I know you . " Had Catherine Anne slept with him ? She doubted it . But had she ? " Yes , now I know you . " " Ed , darling , we 've still hardly begun to know each other . Ed , we have so much more to know of each other , " she said as the musicians tuned up . " And when we discover each other , my Sweet , it will be like reading a great poem in which there is fresh beauty and insighton every page . And we must n't be banal . Do you know what is the plague , the scourge , of love ? It is banality . The banality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As he spoke , the orchestra began softly to play a piece , Seventeen . They were able to talk while it was played . Ellen kept time by tapping her feet on the floor . " Yes , the mob wallows in the pig troughs of banality . Ciphers from the mob fall in love , after their greedy fashion , and of course they make their love disgusting because of the dreariest sentimentality . They say to one another that they will love forever . As if they had the capacity to love truly for a day , let alone for an eternity , when they will return to the mud some day , the mud that they merit . How disgusting these human zeros are ! When I think of these flesh-and-blood minus signs , I could retch . " He paused for effect . " Our love is not going to be like that . " She continued to tap her feet on the floor . From the cornerpI05of her eye she saw a few couples pass before her as they glided around the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , " she said . " I have a philosophy of love . The girl I love must share it . " " Yes , " she said demurely , effacingly . " To love is not merely to take ; it is also to give . In love we give what is called the soul as well as the body . But do n't think I 'm inconsistent . Do n't think that I place any supernatural connotations on the soul . To believe in a supernatural soul is to be weak , cowardly , to need crutches . By the soul I mean the I , the Me , the Ego , all that which is You , that makes you distinguishable from all other human beings alive , from all others who have ever lived , or who ever will live . " She fingered her engagement ring and began to twist uncomfortablyin her chair . She played with her dress . The saxophone broke through the rhythmic pattern of the music , its notes wailing , brassy , like a cry of desires which knew no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the saxophone were entering her body , were lodging themselves in her spine , were creeping up and down it to thrill her to the point of discomfort . Her head was light . The saxophone faded out of the music . She felt momentarily weak , as if she had been drained temporarily of her personality . She smiled at Ed , almost apologetically . " Yes , my Sweet , " he went on . He seemed so calm , so poised , so fully in possession of himself . " I said that love is to give as well as to take . In the primordial society in which we live , the savages believe that the man takes and that the woman gives . The man gives , too . The man gives the woman his body just as much as she gives him hers . And the man gives his Ego , too . Sweet , when you and I are prepared for the consummation of our love , each of us will give . We will give our beautiful bodies . For it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we both have beautiful bodies . " The saxophone again dominated the music , making her more restless . She was unable to sit still . She hastily lit another cigarette . She tapped the table with her fingers.  |p106Ed  watched her closely . She blew him a kiss . " Ellen , do n't think that I am sentimental because I say that love can be beautiful . It can , it can if it is like the soaring of two eagles over the mountains where ' they are far , far above the valleys of the commonplace . That is a figure of speech of mine to describe how I conceive of the emotional aspects of love  --  our love . " The orchestra paused between pieces . She was aware of the absence of music . Absent-mindedly she kept turning her engagementring around and around on her finger . " But before our love is consummated , we must be ready for one another . We must feel that each of us is making a gift to the other . We must know beforehand that each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not something that can be done lightly , if it is to have meaning , meaning other than the meaning of a mere sensation . Until we are fully prepared we must not do this . " She strained in her chair , and at the same time a puzzled expression came over her face . The orchestra played a soft , a mawkishly sentimental tune which she could n't remember ever having heard before . The lights faded out and a blue spotlightplayed across the floor . " Ed , I love you , " she said breathlessly . She squashed her cigarette . " When I feel that I am ready , and you feel that you are ready , we will consummate our love like free spirits . We will be pagans . But the time must come , and it will . Until then we must not do anything to spoil our love . We must not , my Sweet . I tell you , I disdain all the clumsy fumbling , the devious trickery , the lascivious inching of most chaps when they try to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ellen , I am not trying to make you . But we must understand what we are doing fully so that it will be beautiful . " Again she beat time to the music . She let her hands drop under the table , and monotonously she rubbed them together . She sat on the edge of the chair . " Ed , please , let 's dance . " pI07He stood up . " Yes , let us dance . " She strained herself to him . The lights went on . The music stopped . The musicians set down their instruments and rose for an intermission . Ellen glanced toward them , disappointed . Ed walked over to the orchestra while she waited . She saw him talking to them , noticing his broad shoulders . Suddenly she heard him raising his voice . " Do n't talk to me that way ! " The few couples present turned to watch and listen . Waiters and the managers scurried forward to surround Ed , and at the same moment Ellen ran across the small dance floor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager said to Ed ; he was a plump little fellow with a small black mustache and beady eyes . " I 'll leave with pleasure . And take your hands off me if you know what 's healthy for you , " Ed shouted to the manager who had begun to push him gently . A burly waiter , huskier than Ed , drew up by the manager 's side . " Come on , you , get the hell out of here ! " he said . Ellen stiffened . Her features were distorted because of her fright . The manager turned from Ed and took the burly waiter 's sleeve . " Stop it , Joe ! " the manager said . He stood between Ed and the waiter . Ed 's fists were clenched , and his left was cocked . He looked lean , catlike . " Please leave my establishment , quietly . I ca n't have this here . This is a respectable place , " the manager said . " Ed , let 's go , " Ellen said persuasively ; for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a circle around them on the dance floor . " If any of you bozos will step up to me , come on ! " Ed said . " Why , say , you . . . " The manager turned to the burly waiter.  | " Go way , Joe ! I tell you to go ! " the manager said . Sulkily , the waiter moved off , but he stood glowering from a distance . " Will you go now , or will I have to call the police ? " the manager asked . " You 'd have to call the cops , would n't you ? " Ed retorted . " Joe , call the police , " the manager said . Ellen tugged at his sleeve . Ed sneered and turned to go back to his table . His waiter followed with the bill . Ed paid , and did n't give any tip . He walked with Ellen to the door . He turned around by the hat-check stand . " Anybody want to come downstairs ? " he called . No one answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Outside , it was sunny . The sidewalk was crowded . " I 'm going back there . They refused to play an encore and then they insulted me , " Ed said . " Oh , forget it , Ed . " His mood changed . He laughed heartily . " Ellen , you have had quite a bit of excitement today . " " Too much . I was shaking up there . I was afraid they would all jump on you . " " I could have taken care of myself . " She slipped her hand in his arm . " Now , what will we do ? " she asked . " Your slightest wish is my command , " he said . They wandered off.  |p109Ellen  went to her room again and looked at the clock on her disarranged dresser . Only eleven-thirty . Ed was looking for a job today and he would n't come to see her until eight-thirty tonight . She had the rest of the day to get through . Gertrude Dorgan was coming over for lunch and that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need any help in passing the time . She had her thoughts now . Yesterday had been like a dream , the happiest day of her whole life . The feeling of yesterdaypersisted in her . Her pleasure from all that she and Ed had said and done continued . It now seemed as if it had been such a long day . When she had gone to bed last night , it had seemed as if it had been so short . Because of Ed , it seemed to her as if the dividing line of day and night , the divisions of time , had been erased . She had a curious sense , as though something from yesterday continued to exist in her , and in all of the world . She went to the parlor and stood by the window , looking across at the golfers moving about on the green in Jackson Park . They seemed small , strange little creatures inhabiting a world different from hers . And they did . She and Ed lived in a world all by themselves . No one could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people playing golf in love ? If they were , it was not like her and Ed . It could n't be . She turned from the window and sat on the sofa . Her father would n't be home tonight . She and Ed would be all alone . She counted the hours which she must wait on her fingers , starting with the right hand . Then she counted the hours starting with her left hand . Even though she wished he was already arriving ,  |p110it  was still pleasant to wait for him . Now everything was pleasant . Last night Ed had petted her and kissed her good night . She had been so shy . He was so delicate in his feelings , in his conduct toward her . She smiled . He was more delicate than he needed to be . After their conversation in the Blue Elephant yesterday afternoon , she had imagined that he would make love to her . Why did he say that they had to wait until they were both ready ? Could it be that he did not love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that he did . She was positive that he did . Of course , the way he talked about love was strange to her . But he spoke with so much conviction , he seemed to be so sincere when he talked , that he must believe what he said . And in a way what he said was true . She felt so much more than she used to feel . Being in love had aroused so many feelings . That was what he must mean . What he said were figures of speech to tell her what these new feelings all were like . Oh , she adored him ! And just think , at this moment the poor boy had to go tramping around looking for a job . That was wrong . He should n't have to work  --  now . He should be able to live withoutworking , to live for her , to spend these glorious spring days with her , spend them the way he and she had spent yesterday . Tonight when he came to see her , what would he talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , closed her eyes , and tried to imagine him as he would look when she met him at the door tonight . She jumped up impulsively and went to her room . She dug into her dresser drawer where she had hidden the engagement ring . She looked at it . She cared more for it than if it were a real diamond , the most expensive diamond in the world . " You say that you saw Catherine Anne ? " Ellen asked Gertrudewhile the two girls sat having lunch at Ellen 's . A large salad bowl was on the table between them. pIII " I went over to see her yesterday afternoon . " Just at the time she and Ed were talking and dancing at the Blue Elephant ! " And what happened ? " Ellen asked . " She turned white . I felt sorry for her . " " What did she say ? " Ellen asked eagerly . " At first when I told her , she did n't say a word . She sat so still . And she turned so pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her : Catherine Anne , I was out , on a date with Ellen Rogers and two boys last night . We went out . on a double date with EdmondLanson and Frank Dolan . And guess what ? Edmond Lanson and Ellen Rogers got engaged to be married dancing on the floor at the Palm Tree . ' She turned pale . " " What did she say about me ? " " Nothing . " " Gertrude , we 're such good friends that you must n't hide anything from me , " Ellen said , seeking to hypnotize Gertrude with a steady gaze ; Ed did that to her sometimes . " Honest , Ellen , she did n't say anything against you . In fact , she was dazed by the news . I could see that it phased her . Before she recovered herself , she was just petrified  --  petrified . Then she tried to be brave , and she smiled . She asked me twice was it the night before ? I said yes . That seemed to hit her harder . Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had a date with her and not kept it . I ca n't think why she should have become so petrified unless it was that he became engaged to you on a night when he had two-timed her . " " Here , have some more salad , " Ellen said , passing the bowl to Gertrude . Gertrude helped herself . " I feel sorry for her . But she 's not the first person in the world who cared for someone and lost , " Ellen said . " Ellen , I want to ask you a question . " Ellen nodded majestically . " Have you ever loved and lost ? " " No , " Ellen answered emphatically. pII2 " Then maybe you do n't understand how Catherine Anne must have felt . I was sorry for her . Honest I was . " " Perhaps she 's crying over spilt milk . " When she was so happy , why should she be jealous of Catherine Anne for having gone out to dances with Ed ? " Ellen , would you cry over spilt milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know me . Do you think I would ? " " No , I do n't , " Gertrude said with noticeable admiration . She thought for a moment . " But you 'll never have to . You 'll always get everything you want in life . You 're just that kind of a person . I do n't think Catherine Anne is . " " Catherine Anne has no wings . She 's prosaic . " Gertrude looked puzzled . " She has n't any wings . She does n't try to fly . " " I never thought of her that way . " " She 's not Ed 's type . " " I always thought of her as a kid who 's awfully sweet and is never catty or back-biting . " Ellen pushed aside her plate , rose , and paced back and forth by the table . " What if she is ? I 'm fed up hearing everyone say that Catherine Anne is so sweet . She 's sweet . She 's decent . What about it ? Is nobody else ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much for saints , anyway . " " Ellen , you do n't really mean what you said . " " I do n't ? " Ellen said , halting in her tracks . " I mean you do n't mean it about real saints . Like Saint Theresa . " " What do I care about saints ? " Ellen said , sitting down , speaking with ennui . " I would n't talk like that , " Gertrude said , hurt . " What else did Catherine Anne have to say ? " " Oh , not much . She wished that you and Ed would be happy . " Ellen did n't reply . Why should she resent Catherine Anne ? She was the victor . She should at least not show any resent-pI I 3ment and gain credit for being magnanimous . Ed said that magnanimity was a sign of weakness . He was the first person she 'd ever met who said what he thought . That was why they 'd fallen in love . He had told her that they were kindred spirits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes , I do . I could tell . She ' was n't just putting on an act . She was terribly hurt . But she meant it . " How would she act if she ever lost Ed ? She would n't lose him . She would n't ! " You 're different from most of us girls , Ellen . You 're strong . But everybody is n't like you . " " Do you know what 's going to happen to Catherine Anne ? She 'll end up an old maid , going to everyone 's wedding and everyone 's funeral . And everybody will go on saying that Catherine Anne is so sweet . . . so sweet you ca n't eat her . Christ , put her in a glass case . I never could stand girls like her . Another girl in our class that I think the same of is Natalie O'Reedy , " Ellen said . Gertrude looked wistfully at Ellen . Ellen was immediately sorry that she had said this . She should n't have . She should forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ellen , I wish I was like you , " Gertrude said sadly . Ellen 's mood changed inexplicably . She smiled graciously at Gertrude . She thought that it was spring , the most gorgeous spring that had ever come into the world . And the world was like a flower opening its petals , opening them to Ellen Rogers . And poor Gertrude here , she could n't know this joy . She never could . She could n't help feeling sorry for Gertrude . Even for Catherine Anne . Again Gertrude looked wistfully at Ellen , then she smiled sadly . Ellen was going to speak kindly to Gertrude , but the telephone rang . She dashed to answer it . Gertrude listened intently , trying to hear every word Ellen was saying to Ed on the phone in the hallway.  | " I 'm sorry that Father is n't home . I wanted you to meet him , " Ellen said . " I 'll get plenty of opportunities to meet him . " She nodded thoughtfully . " What did you do today ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was here for lunch . I read . " " What did you read ? " " A book . With letters on the pages . " " How remarkable . " They smiled at each other . " It was poetry . " " What poetry ? Edgar Guest ? " " Who 's he ? " " I was being sarcastic . He writes about home sweet home in the newspapers . " " I read Kipling poems because you talked of them . " " What else did you do ? " " Waited until I would see you , " she said demurely . " I 'll bet you did . " " And you 'll win your bet . " " Impossible . " " Why ? " " I never win bets . That 's the secret of my failure . " " I 'll bring you good luck . From now on you 'll win your bets . " " You must seal that promise with a kiss , " he said. pI1 5She kissed him passionately . " Do you know what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm 's length . She did n't speak . Her expression itself was a question mark . " I 'm adoring you . " She moved to embrace him , but he held her firmly . " Yes , I 'm adoring you . You 're like nothing else in the world . " " Darling , I 'm . . . oh . . . I love you , " she told him helplessly . " You 're so adorable that there are no words to describe how adorable you are . " She was anxious and , also , grateful . " No , words are inadequate . Were I not so realistic , I should compare you with the beauties of nature . I would say that your eyes are a cosmos containing all the stars of the heavens . But the stars are cold and distant planets , with a temperature so low that human habitation on them is impossible . " He laughed ironically . " I would say that your hair is like the sun , but then , I 'm realistic . Therefore I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sunlight . The sun is huge , ungainly , and it is not possible to fondle the sun as one can fondle your hair , run one 's hands through it . And should I compare your lips to wine ? Wine makes men babble . Your lips do n't . They are made for kisses , for passion . And is your body that of a nymph ? It is not . A nymph is unreal . You are real , terribly real , beautifully real . " He caressed her . " But why should we bother now with words . My Sweet , I am now ready . "  |p119Ed  frowned when he came out of the Owl Drugstore at State and Quincy . He walked briskly toward Randolph Street and let loose a flood of curses . But why should he curse Catherine Anne ? He had just telephoned her and had been prepared to give her a cock-and-bull story about the money he 'd borrowed and an explanation for not having telephoned her as he had promised he would . But she had interrupted him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't uttered one word of recrimination against him . That made him sore . He could n't stand people like that . She was trying to shame him with her nobility . Nobility ! Saintliness ! It was enough to make him puke . That kind of nobility in women , that characteristic of the female , was the most difficult trait a man must cope with . Women wanted to make you feel guilty . That was why CatherineAnne had been so sweet to him on the phone , so noble , so Christian . She had said not one bitter word . He liked bitterness . When you stepped on someone and she acted like a saint , how could you respect her ? The answer was that he could n't . Bitterness was one of the necessary ingredients of strength and character . But Catherine Anne was without a touch of bitterness . He paused in his meditation and turned to look after a cute flapper . Not bad quail , he thought . He remembered how he used to go over to Washington Park with the boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They used to call it gash hunting . He had come a long way since then . He had come a very long way since he had been a boy graduating from Conception school on Grand Boulevard. pI20 He walked on . There was more than meets the eye when a girl acted like Catherine Anne . There was calculation . If there were a God , and he were praying to that God , he would ask that he be delivered from weeping , noble Penelopes . Lord deliver him from all good , calculating women . Save him from their machinations . When he came to State and Randolph Streets he stopped and began to laugh . He was out looking for a job . That was part of the joke . He was looking for a job in order to get some money . Then he would get married . Ellen last night had been lovely . He had found her so lovely that he had spent all of the morning remembering her . The after-effects of pleasure , the memories of it were as delicious as was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her so perfectly . Never had his technique worked better . He had worked her up just properlyfor the moment , stimulated her , prepared her for passion . What exquisite pleasure she promised now for the future . Yes , his workmanship on Ellen was admirable . No , this was n't a conceited thought . He was merely describing the evidence of his own senses . When he had allowed it to happen , he had alreadyimpressed on her that it was he who was really giving , not she . He had transvalucd all value , he told himself with a laugh . But this was n't finding a job . Lanson , you 're job-hunting for the steenth time in your short life . Yes , his life had been short so far , but how full a life . He crossed State Street . What a sunny day it was , a hell of a day on which to go job-hunting . Look at the sun ! Man was not made to work in the springtime . After he and Ellen were married , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might wangle her father into taking care of that peccadillo . Why not ? The old man was well off and he ought to take care of a son-in-law . He turned back on State Street to go to a Thompson Restaurantfor a cup of coffee . Finding the restaurant , he entered , pI2Igot a ham sandwich and a cup of coffee and sat down at a chair with a marble-topped arm . He ate , thinking that last night he had attained the Unattainable . Perfect and delightful happiness . Would it last ? He had never had a love experience to match last night 's . And she had been so lovely . She had thought that he was so tender , so delicate , so gentle , so tactful and considerate . It was techniquethat he could be justly proud of . Too bad she had n't been a virgin . But that was not important . He was no moralist . Yes , with his technique a beautiful girl was like clay in the potter 's hand . He was the potter , she the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heart 's desire . Catherine Anne could never be the companion that Ellen was and would be . Catherine Anne was moral , saintly to the core . And Ellen , like himself , was an immoralist . What a future they could look forward to . Yes , what a future  --  if they only had money . But then , what was money to deter Hellfire Lanson ? Money was easy to get in this world , particularly if you did n't place an inordinate value upon it , and if you were smart . It was a means , not an end . But right now he could use a little of that means . He wanted to get a new suit as a kind of celebration of his new role . He wanted to take her around . She was so beautiful that he wanted to show her off , take her to swank places where they would both be the cynosure of all eyes . He wanted people who saw them to know that she was his woman . To be able to say my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gave you a sense of dignity you attained in no other way . Egotist that he was , he was forced , in the name of truth , to make this admission to himself . However , he would never admit it to anyone else . If he wanted a job , he could go back with John Devormer . John would be delighted to have him back . Their misunderstandingcould easily be patched up . All that had happened was that John had tried to press him to work harder . But no , he would n't go back . That would be eating crow . Lanson would go to his grave without ever having eaten crow . On that resolution he lit a cigarette . A new idea lit up his face . He had a plan for a job . It wouldpI22 mean a little confinement , a week , and that would net him thirty-five bucks . He might even borrow some money on the basis of his job , and that would be so much extra cash to the good . Borrow money . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every cent that he had borrowed in the last three years , every penny he had gotten by gypping someone , was listed in this book . Some day , in the coming period of his affluence , he would pay back all this money . He opened the book and saw the list , written in a neat hand . There it all was , the names and the amounts even down to the games of pool he had played at the expense of the Greek poolroom owner on Fifty-eighth Street . What a model of scrupulous accounting it was . All the sums listed and added up . The last figure was $40 , and beside it was the name Catherine Anne . This ran up the total to $1,419.50 . Not bad , considering that he was only twenty-one . Ah , this was a card . Some day he would be rich , and then it would be a considerablepleasure for him to pay back this money . It would be a good gesture . In the case of some of the sonsofbitches he owed money to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw it in their faces . For girls like Catherine Anne who were so goddamned noble , he would enclose a check and some holy pictures , or some other sacred and priestly object . Ah , he would buy a copy of The Lives of the Saints and send it along with the check to Catherine Anne . That would be a subtle gesture . No further comment needed . He got another cup of coffee and sat down to drink it and tend to his plan concerning this displeasing little matter of work . " Congratulate me . I 've got a job , " Ed said , leaving the buildingwith Ellen and beginning to walk along Sixty-seventh Street toward Stony Island Avenue . " Tell me about it . " " I 'm in the real estate business . "  | " Wait until I tell Father . " " Do n't ; I 'd rather you did n't . " " But he might be able to help you . " " I do n't need help . I shall only be occupied in this business for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For one week Hellfire will be associated with Batten , Fish , O'Doul , and Schwartzfield , Inc . " " What are you going to do ? " " I 'm supposed to spend a week in training , learning to sell suburban lots . For one week you study inside and get thirty-five dollars . Then you go out and sell lots on commission . So I 'm taking the cash and letting the credit go . " He laughed . " I do n't understand you . Darling , you often speak in riddles . " " This is no riddle . I talked myself into the job . I am a good boy for a week beginning next Monday . I get paid a week from Saturday . Then I 'll look for a better connection . " " But how can you get away with it ? " " Hellfire can outwit the universe , " he said , following his statement with an ironic laugh . He added , in a self-deprecatory tone , " I suppose you think that I 'm conceited when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , darling ? " she answered , breaking into a happy laugh . " But what do you think of such conduct  --  morally ? " " What ? " " Do you approve ? Or do you disapprove ? " " I love you . " " Well , then , in order to grasp your answer , it will be necessary to analyze love . " " Let 's not analyze love . Making love is much more fun than analyzing it . " " Is it really ? " " Is n't it ? " " Yes and no . " " What did you say , Ed ? " she asked , her tone suddenly sharp.  | " Just a minute . I said yes and no . Take your friend GertrudeDorgan . I would rather analyze love with her than make loveto her . But with you I would rather do the converse . " " But suppose Gertrude were a beautiful girl ? " " Tempt me not . How could she or anyone possibly be more beautiful , more attractive than you ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger than fiction . But what 's on the agenda ? " he said . " Let 's do things . Let 's have some excitement . I want to dance . I want people to see us . " " So do I. " " Where 'll we go ? " " We ca n't . Batten , Fish , O'Doul , and Schwartzfield , Inc. do n't pay me until next week . " " Darling , I have some money . " She dug into her pocketbook and pulled out a small roll of bills . " But , darling , what 's the matter ? " she asked , seeing that he was scowling at her . He did n't answer . She watched him questioningly . " Put that money away , " he ordered peremptorily . She obeyed him , startled . " What 's the matter , Ed ? Please do n't look at me that way . " " What do you think I am , a gigolo ? " " Oh , Ed , I did n't mean anything . Ed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours . Ours . " " Do n't think I 'm a gigolo . " " But I do n't . " As they walked along he did n't speak . She waited for him to say something . " Well , how long is this going on ? " she asked , suddenly becomingsharp . " I do n't answer questions addressed to me in that tone of voice . " " You do n't ? Well , you do n't have to act toward me the way you are.  | " I would n't , if you had n't insulted me . I 'm made in such a way that I do n't take insults . " " But I was n't insulting you . " " That makes it worse . " " What are we going to do now , play riddles ? " " You did n't mean it as an insult . You just took it for granted . " " No , I did n't . I was just happy . After last night I was so happy , and I wanted to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did n't even think of it . After all , the way we have talked together , I thought we were above . . . above conventions . " " I do n't care about conventions . But what do you think I am ? " " Ed , let 's forget it . " He unbent into a charming smile . " I do n't need crowds , music , noise . Let 's take a walk in the park . " They crossed the street , entered the park through a path in the bushes , hugged , kissed , and came out on the damp grass of the golf course . He put his arm around her . " Ed , we do n't have to have misunderstandings . " " I know it . But I have a beastly temper . And I 'm proud . I take great pride in my pride , Ellen . " " And I take great pride in my Ed . " He idly took her right hand and squeezed it tenderly . " Did you think about me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think two times two equals four , " he answered . " Do you love me more now than you did before last night ? " " Ask me the same question over . Does two times two equalfour ? " " I hope so . " " It does . That 's the answer . Give me a kiss . " He embraced her . They strolled on arm-in-arm in the park . It was a fine spring night.  | " Mr. Lanson , my daughter has talked a lot about you . I 'm mighty glad to meet you , " Mr. Rogers said , seated at the dinner table between Ed and Ellen . " Thank you , sir , " Ed said deferentially . " Yes , I am always glad to meet Ellen 's friends . " " Father , they could n't help but be glad to meet you . " " I am sure , Mr. Rogers , that you will not consider me presumptuouswhen I say that Ellen expresses my feelings . " " Not at all . Not at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you call Ed by his first name . Mr. Lansonis too formal . " " Well , I 'm not the type of man , Ed , to stand on formalities . " They went on eating . " You go to college . . . Ed ? " " No , I do n't , Mr. Rogers . I work . " " What line are you in , Ed ? " " My real business is in advertising . But temporarily I 've been considering a connection with Batten , Fish , O'Doul , and Schwartzfield , Inc . " " Who 's that ? " " Batten , Fish , O'Doul , and Schwartzfield . They 're in real estate . " " Of course . I 've heard of them . They deal in subdivisions . I 've never handled any of that myself . " " The real estate business can be promising for a young man if he plugs at it , I 'm sure . But my heart is in advertising . " " I suppose you have to plug just about as hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about sums it up properly , Mr. Rogers . What I 'm interested in is direct-by-mail advertising . I have a lot of promising ideas about it . I 'm planning to work with the ultimateobject of establishing my own business . " " Have you had experience in that game ? " " A great deal of it . I 've sold advertising . I was on the road for John Devormer . He has a big agency and handles sizeable accounts . And I 've sold advertising for other agencies here in the city , direct-by-mail , various promotion ideas . I know the game pretty well and I have a number of contacts now as a result of my experience . " " How old are you , Ed ? " " Twenty-one . " " You talk as if you had a great deal of experience , consideringyour age . " " I do n't want to overstate how much experience I 've had .. But considering my age , I have had fairly wide experience in selling , particularly in advertising . " " How did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was considering it as something temporary . " " That 's good . It never pays to be idle . Something is always better than nothing . But I do n't think that outfit you mentionedas connecting with is too honest . I hear that they sell a lot of worthless subdivisions . " " I feared that . So I 've been hesitant about connecting with them . I have another proposition now to consider , one in my own line . " Watching and listening , Ellen believed Ed was making a good impression on her Father . But he should . He was so smart . He was going to be a great man . And he would be her husband . She would tell Father about their engagement soon . But first she would let Ed make an impression . " You said you were with a good firm , was n't the name you mentioned Devormer ? " " Yes , John Devormer . " " How did you happen to leave him ? " " I wanted to locate in Chicago rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was n't giving me enough . " " Did you sell well on the road ? " " I think he was more than satisfied . " " Why did n't he want to pay you more ? Did he say ? " " He gave me a song and dance . He likes to squeeze his pennies . I wanted him to branch out and expand the business , too , but he could n't see it because he wo n't take chances . We did n't have a falling out , and parted friends , but we did disagree , so I decided that I 'm young still and I can take a chance of locating with a firm that promises me a better future . Then , too , John runs his own business . I could n't have gone much higher with him . I want to attain a higher status than that of traveling salesman , not that I deprecate that , of course . I 'm ambitious , though . And I thought that if I came back to Chicago I could locate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensible . Of course , you 're young , Ed , but you talk in a mature manner . And maybe you 're right in your ideas . Let 's hope so , anyway . " " Thank you , Mr. Rogers . " The maid removed the dishes and served them cake , ice cream , and coffee . " But while we 've been talking business , Mr. Rogers , I fear that we 've ignored Ellen . Perhaps she does n't care to hear so much conversation of a business character . " " Do n't mind me , " Ellen said gaily . " Yes , Ed , Ellen told me a lot about you , and I 'm mighty glad she brought you around tonight . You must always know that you 're welcome here . Come and see us often . And some time when Ellen is n't around , you come and we 'll go into your ideas about advertising . You know , I 'm inclined to believe in the motto it pays to advertise . ' There 's a big future in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a novel , It Pays to Advertise . Ever hear of it ? " " No , I did n't . Who wrote it ? " " Golly , I do n't remember . I 'll look around and see if it 's on the shelf here and let you take it . Do you read much ? " " Ed reads a lot , Father . "  | " You do . What kind of books do you read ? " " I read all kinds of books , poetry , philosophy , all kinds . " " Deep stuff , huh ? Does reading philosophy , Ed , help you in your line ? " " No , I would n't say it does . I would n't say that Herbert Spencer would make me a better salesman . Philosophy is about the general problems of the world , the nature of the world . I enjoy it . I like to speculate . " " How far did you go in school , Ed ? " " I only went to eighth grade , and then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You sound like an educated man . You must be a hard worker . " " I must say I 'm not afraid of work . And then , also , I 've tried to educate myself . " Ellen smiled . " Well , that 's the spirit . With an attitude like yours you have a fine chance of getting ahead . And , of course , nowadays the world belongs to youth . There 's a premium on youth . Yes , the world is a new world , different from what it used to be . Great times are ahead for youth in this country , Ed . I wish I was a young man again myself . " Ellen believed that Ed was saying just the right things . It was all so funny , but she had to keep a straight face . But still , what Ed said was not just lying . Ed had a wonderful future . Ed was a wonderful person , and he was hers . Mrs. Ellen Lanson ! Mrs. Edmond Lanson ! " Smoke ? " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a cigar with me . " Mr. Rogers handed Ed a cigar . They lit and puffed . Mr. Rogers leaned back in his chair comfortably . " Well , Ellen , it 's been a nice supper , and I had a nice little visit with Ed here . " " Father , I knew you 'd like Ed. "  | " Ed , did you mean what you said to Father tonight ? " Ellen asked , alone with him in the front of the apartment . " Of course . If I had my own business , I 'd really buckle down . What I ca n't stand is to be working for someone else , to be hired by some cluck and to have him as my boss . " " Well , Father fell for you like a ton of bricks . I could tell . " " You think so ? " " Did you like him ? " " Why should n't I ? Of course I did . " " I sort of take him for granted . It 's hard for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real estate venture of mine is over , I 'm going to look around seriously . " " You asked me not to mention it to Father . And then you spoke of it yourself . " " , Did I ? It 's not important . I 'm going to find something worth while next week . " " You do n't think it would be worth your while to stay with this real estate firm ? " " What ? I should sell on commission ? " " I would n't know if it 's good or not . But I do know that my darling can be a success at anything he wants . " " Are you trying to convince me that I should get ahead in the world ? " " What do you mean ? " " Since you are going to be Mrs. Lanson , you are going to see to it that Mr. Lanson amounts to something . " " I was n't thinking of that . I was thinking of it for you , for your own sake . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need someone to push me , to help me find myself . You know , you and I want to get somewhere . We want to live a beautiful life , and I 'll have to earn the money that will permit us to do just that . " " Ed , you know , you 're so intelligent . " " Am I ? "  | " I do n't have to tell you how smart you are . " " You mean I 'm conceited ? " " Not at all . A person as smart as you must know that he 's smart . " " I am conceited . I believe in conceit and pride . What the hell is a man without them ? Ellen , are you proud of being so beauti-ful ? " " Am I so beautiful ? " " Do n't you know that you are ? " " That 's a question to ask me . " " I 'm going to teach you to be conceited about your beauty . I want you to be proud and conceited under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? " " That your pride and conceit does n't conflict with my own . " " You 're such a darling . You 're so sweet , " she said , kissing him . " You say I 'm sweet ? No one else in the world could get away with an insult like that , no one but Ellen , " he teased . " I have a favored position . " " You 're my favored nation , " he said , smiling . " Ed , when we get married , what am I going to do about cooking ? I do n't think I can even boil an egg properly . " " I 'm not marrying you because you can or can not boil anegg  --  " Thank God for that . " " If there be such a God . " " Thank God for that if there be a God . " " And to continue , I 'll teach you to cook . " " You know how to cook , too ? " " Of course I do . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What ca n't you do ? " " Oh , for instance , I could n't fall in love with an ugly girl . " " Not even if she were me ? " " You could n't be ugly . "  | " Suppose I was . Suppose I should be injured in an automobile accident and have my face disfigured ? " " I 'd sue the guilty rascal . Then I 'd knock his block off . And then  --  I 'd take you to Paris . You know , my ancestors were French . I want to go to Paris . As a matter of fact , I think that I 'd fare better in Paris than any place else in the world . My oldestbrother 's been in Paris . " " You have n't talked much of your family . " " My brothers and my sister happen to be away . My sister is in California , married . My kid brother 's got some job up at Madison , and my oldest brother 's at sea . He 's traveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel with you , Ed . " " We will . Everything will come to us in time . Everything always comes to me . " " And I 'd adore being in Paris with you . " " That settles that  --  some day we 'll go to Paris . " She kissed him . " Ed , I 've got to decide on how I 'll break the news to Father . " " Is it a problem ? " " Yes , in a way . " " Then I 'll solve it . " " How ? " " Whenever you want a problem solved come to me and allow me two minutes to think about it . " " I adore the way you express yourself . " " Keep quiet . I 'm solving problems . " She laughed and waited . He sat perfectly still , his face blank . " All right , " he said after a few moments of silence . " Here 's what you do . You prepare your father first for the revelation . You sound him out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he thinks I 'm intelligent , you stress that when you talk about me . If it 's ambition , ditto . And then for two or three days , in an unobtrusive way , keep bringing the subject of conversationaround to me . Prepare him that way to accept me . Tell him , also , that you go out only with me . That will further help him to get used to the idea . He will begin to see that youp133care for me . Finally , after such preparation , you will tell him . However , you must also let him know that you care for him and that you are his devoted daughter . Your only wish is to make him happy . You know that he would wish for you to be happy . " Ed smiled . " You see , if you put him in the position where he is on the defensive , it will be harder for him to refuse giving his permission . Put him on the spot so that if he refuses to sanction our engagement he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the way to handle him . " " Might n't it be better just to tell him straight out ? " " No , it would n't . " " Why ? It might . " " But if he does n't approve , then he can act as if he were the injured one . If you blurt it straight out , you cast aside the chance of manipulating him . The key to getting what you want in this world is found in the knowledge and ability to manipulatepeople . " " Do you like to manipulate people ? " " Of course I do . " " I just wanted to know , " she said , smiling enigmatically . He returned her smile . " I know what entered your little brain , " he said jocularly . " What ? " " The seeds of doubt . The poison of doubt . The snake of doubt . " " About what ? " " Hellfire . " " Oh , Ed , do n't be silly . " " Silly ? That is one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pride . " " I 'll tell Father . I 'll do it just the way you want me to do it . " " I could n't manipulate you , even assuming that I wanted to. , , " No ? " " I love you . And , besides , you 're no innocent little lamb coming to the slaughter . You 're a girl with experience . Tell me something personal . "  | " What ? " " Tell me , I know I 'm not the first man in your life . How many were there before me ? " " Does that make any difference ? " " No , not fundamentally . I was just curious . " " There were not many . " " How many ? " " Two . " " Who were they ? " " Bill Northrup was one . He was terrible . I was such a fool . The other was a friend of Father 's when I was only fourteen . " " Who was he ? " " His name is Stevens . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some day . And Northrup , who 's he ? " " He 's a cad .

" " He is n't worth beating up . " " If he is a bounder , that is precisely what he deserves . When I see him I 'll decide on this question . " " I did n't know much  --  about life . It was just one of those things that happened . And then , when I found myself in trouble , he tried to get out of it and leave me to take care of myself . Oh , he disgusted me . You do n't know what it did to me , to my feelings . Until I met you , I was cynical . I hated everybody . And it was largely his doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a bozo is he ? " " Oh , he 's just another boy . He 's not interesting . " " And were n't there any others ? " " No . That 's all . " " Are you telling me the truth ? " " Ed . I could n't lie to you . " " We 'll never lie to one another , will we , my Sweet ? " " We wo n't . I could n't lie to you . " 135 " And neither could I. " " Ed , what I told you does n't make any difference , does it ? " He took her in his arms , kissed her , caressed her gently . " My Sweetheart , why should it ? We are above such matters . Ellen , you and I are beyond good and evil . "  | " Say , Ellen , what do you think of your friend , Ed Lanson ? " " I like him . He is very charming and intelligent , and he 's ambitious , " Ellen said ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . " Well , he seems to be , I grant that . " " Judging from the way you talked with him , I thought you were impressed by him . " " Well , I ca n't say that I disliked him . When I was talking to him , I thought he was a fine lad . However , I started thinking about him after I left here last night . He seems to talk so damned well . Somehow or other I 'm always suspicious of glib talkers . " " He 's not glib . " " At times he seems mighty glib . I do n't say there 's any harm in your going out with him to dances and parties . But , Ellen , I would n't let myself get serious with that fellow . " " Do n't call him that fellow . " Mr. Rogers raised his bushy eyebrows and looked at his daughter , surprised , anxious , uncertain . " Ellen , are you serious about him ? " " I had planned to tell you this morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Rogers did not react instantly to Ellen 's announcement , and she waited , defiant . The words seemed to sink slowly into his consciousness like water being soaked up by a sponge . As if he were making a discovery , he realized the meaning of her words several seconds after she had spoken . He was stunned.  |p137Ellen  , watching the change that had come upon her father 's face , remembered Ed 's advice to her about the way she should break this news . Ed had been right . Well , it was too late now to follow Ed 's advice . " Ellen , have you given this serious thought ? " her father asked , a note of alarm in his voice . " I love Ed . Father , I would n't want to do anything you didn'tapprove of , but in this I have to decide for myself . Do n't tryto change my mind because you ca n't , you ca n't . " She had spoken rapidly , without any premeditation . " Ellen , you know  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to get married  --  if I 'm in love . " " Can he take care of you ? " " I 'd marry him even if he could n't . " " Ellen , Ellen , you must n't become so excited . Do n't lose your temper that way . " " I 'm not losing my temper . But , Father . . . it 's embarrassing to have to talk about this  --  I 'm in love . " Ellen became calm . With the return of her equanimity , she regretted her outburst and decided to win over her father . She metamorphosed herself into a totally different person , a young girl who was shy , demure . " Father , I know you do n't mean to cast aspersions on him after only meeting him once . " " Of course , I do n't . I admit that I 'm thinking of you , not of him . My girl , you 're taking a very serious and important step . You ca n't be rash about marriage without paying a price for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embitter your entire life . If you marry the wrong person your entire life can be poisoned . " " Father , I know it , I know it . Ed is n't the wrong person . " " Well , it takes a little serious thought . If I was convinced that he was the right one for you , why , you could have my approvalin two shakes of a lamb 's tail . " " You will be when you really get to know him . " " Ellen , you 're not going to rush . . . this marriage ? "  | " We have n't made any plans . I wanted to talk with you beforewe even considered making plans . " Ellen observed how , due to this statement , her father 's shouldershad sagged in a physical revelation of his relief . Almost simultaneously she grasped what she was certain was a plan forming in his mind . He would try to wean her away by proposinga long engagement . She was more than prepared for anything like that . " Ellen , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to promise me that you wo n't be precipitate . " " What do you mean ? " " You wo n't run off in flightiness and marry secretly , and you wo n't . . . you wo n't do anything that 's not right . You know what I mean . " Poor , foolish old thing ! " Promise me , Ellen . " " Father , you know I could n't do anything like that . " She went and sat on his lap and kissed his forehead . He smiled wanly . " Father , you 'll change your mind about Ed . And Ed likes you . He thought you were wonderful . " " Why did n't both of you tell me last night ? " " He wanted to , but I would n't let him . I wanted to tell you when we were alone . " " Is he Catholic ? " " Yes .

" " With him ? . . . Ed , I mean ? " " No , I arranged to have supper with Gertrude Dorgan downtown . You know Gertrude . She 'd be disappointed if I broke our appointment .

He smiled feebly , kissed her on the forehead , and left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . The day was raw , cold , more like a day in March than in May . They walked aimlessly in Jackson Park under a sky that was heavy and dull . The green of the grass and the trees was deepened by the absence of sunlight . The wind was strong and steady as it battered through the trees and shrubbery . " So , your father said that I 'm glib , " Ed said , clutching Ellen 's arm . Ed 's strange laugh puzzled Ellen , disconcerted her . " Ed , do n't be angry . I 'll bring my father around . " " Why should I be angry ? Your father 's comments on me , his distrust of me , is merely a self-portrait . He described himself when he talked to you about me this morning . " " Ed , just what do you mean ?

I do n't want charity . I do n't require any crutches , financial or spiritual . " " Ed , dear , please do n't jump down my throat . I did n't mean crutches . You do n't have to call it a crutch . " " A rose by any other name is just as sweet . " " Ed , you 're angry . " " I am angry . But not because of your father . He does n't phase me . I do n't like the mien and aspect of things today . " " What things ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that lousysky ! " he said , stopping and pointing upward with his left arm . He shook his fist at the sky and exclaimed simultaneously : " Goddamn you ! " Too bewildered to speak , concerned , fearful that she might become the object of Ed 's anger , she stared at him . He stood in the center of a gravel path , continuing to shake his fist at the sky and to goddam it . She was frightened . He was inclined to such unexpected and curious moods of temper . He was so moody and so changeable . With a person like that she could never be sure of herself . Ed ceased to berate the sky . He took off his hat and stood scowling as the wind mussed his hair . Ellen remembered how he had lost his temper and beaten up the man in Lincoln Park . He had been magnificent then . Now his anger had another meaning . It was disturbing . She wished he would snap out of this mood of his . If she did n't know him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad . " Ed , we ca n't help it because of the sky and the weather . " " That 's why I 'm so angry . That 's precisely what gripes me . We ca n't help it . I ca n't do anything about it . My wishes are disregardedby the forces of nature . I ca n't tell the goddamned sun to come out and make it obey me . I ca n't force the dirty , filthy wind to calm down and transform itself into wafting zephyrs . " " But , Ed , darling , what 's the use of getting angry at something that 's beyond our control ? " " That 's why I should become angry . " He glanced off at a deserted , dark green patch of the golf course . " Master of all hepI4Isurveys , " he said in self-lacerating irony . He gritted his teeth and scowled theatrically . " Master of all he surveys , " he repeated . Ellen had an impulse to laugh , but she did not obey it . This was fantastic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so full of moods , so changing , so unpredictable . She watched him as he again shook his fist at the elements . " I suppose you think I 'm crazy ? " he asked , turning a challengingfrown upon her . " Ed , you know I do n't . Please do n't talk that way to me , and please do n't wrinkle up your brows and scowl at me . " " I 'm not angry with you . My displeasure is not connected with any action of yours . " " Well , Ed , why are you angry ? I 'm sorry I told you about Father if this is the way it is going to affect you . You must n't worry about his attitude . " " Oh , I do n't give a good goddamn about your old man . I 'm marrying you , not your father , and I ask no man 's consent or permission for what I do or plan . " " Then , Ed , please , please tell me why are you in such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not knowing what to say , she did n't answer . This was such an entirely new mood in him , and it was showing her a side of his character she had never even imagined or suspected . How could she , how should she cope with him ? She was tense , anxious , unable to prevent her worry from writing itself upon her face , but she did not speak . " Life is the cause of my mood . Life disgusts me . Look at what a lousy day it is , and I wanted today to be warm , rich with sunshine . Why in the name of Dionysius is such a day necessary ? Who ordered it ? Who wished for it ? Why should n't l be out of sorts on such a day ? But you still have a puzzled , quizzical expression in your eyes . " She shook her head as if to tell him that his statement was n't so . But he continued speaking.  | " Do you know why I 'm angry ? I 'll tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annoys me ? " " What ? " she interrupted . " The wind . I disapprove of it . The sun . I want it to shine in the sky . It is n't heeding my wishes . It is n't even visible today . I do n't want this beastly wind cutting into my bones . But all the same , it cuts and slashes like a knife . " " Let 's get out of the wind . We can go some place and have tea . " " That would be surrender on my part . I wo n't run away from something that gripes me . " His eyes wandered from her . Vaguely , he gazed at the deep green grass . He snarled , then turned back to Ellen . " Do you like the weather ? " " Of course not . I do n't like it cold , ever . " " Do you know what happens to me when I do n't like something ? A fire blazes inside of me . A fire blazes in me and wants to down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it 's the weather and you ca n't control it , what 's the use ? " " I disapprove of the weather , " he said with a tone of finality , as if to end any further discussion . She waited meekly for him to continue or to walk on . And she wished that they were alone somewhere , in a room where she could cuddle against him , pet and kiss all of the anger out of him . She thought of how , when she and Ed were in each other 's arms , and she was kissing him , loving him , she was able to change him into a tired , spent , and charming little boy who would fall asleep with his head on her shoulder . When this happened , she experienced so calm , so lovely , so charming , so sweet a moment . Remembering how she had already had such deliciousexperiences with Ed in the immediate past , knowing that she would have them with him many more times , she felt a sense of power in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ed calm , sweet , tractable . How she had misunderstood so much , so much about sex . She had used to laugh scornfully at men because , with the sexual power of her body , she could make themp143spend themselves and become weak and even wearied . It had seemed like a power in her , a power enabling her to be superior to them . Now she had such a different attitude , such wholly opposite feelings . Her body gave her the power to make Ed love her , to make him seem like her little boy . At such moments Ed was all hers . Yes , she could make of him a boyish lad whose head drooped sleepily on her shoulders . " What are you thinking about ? " Ed asked suspiciously . " How much I love you . " " But are you laughing at me ? " " Ed , you know I could n't . " " Are you with me or against me ? Are you on my side , or are you on the side of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darling . " " You are not on the side of that goddamn muddy sky . The sky is like a garbage dump today . I do n't approve of it . The wind is insulting me . Are you for me or are you for the wind ? " " Why , Ed ! " she exclaimed , puzzled . " I want to know . Does it give you any pleasure to witness the obscene spectacle of the cosmos insulting me , telling me , in effect , that I am just a puny mortal and that it does n't give a good goddamn about my dreams and wishes ? " Again Ellen wanted to laugh . But she was so in awe of him that she did n't dare to . " Ah , I wish that there were gods so that I might fight them . That is why the very cosmos is so insulting . There are no gods . There is nothing but blindness , nothing but forces telling us that we are insignificant little mortals . What are we alleged men but the helpless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused and then went on , with flourishing gestures . " The forces of the world are a mighty army , full of clash and clangor , and they march forward to destroy man . The wind riding across Jackson Park on invisible cosmic horses shouts at men in contempt . Puny , paltry , insignificant race of men ! And I am a man . Ah , how I hate man ! Man is weak . I want to be strong . How can I be strong in the face of the wind ? How can I smash a left hook into the eyes of the cosmos ? "  | " Ed , darling , one ca n't hit one 's head against stone walls . " " But if I do , I can then rest my battered head on your shoulder . " " You 're so darling . " " No , I 'm not . I 'm just a weak mortal , a victim of the powers that blindly shape the world and destroy the dreams of man . There is no Poictesme . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am Lanson . And what is Lanson ? " " He is everything in the world to me . " " And to the world  --  he is nothing . " " Ed , who is Manuel ? What do you mean ? " " You do n't know who James Branch Cabell is ? " " No , I do n't . I 'm so ignorant . I used to think I was smart until I met you . " " James Branch Cabell is one of the greatest living writers . Poictesme is a land of make-believe about which he writes , and Manuel is one of his characters . " " I must read his books . " " That is obligatory . I command it . " " I want to read him . " " Cabell reveals with beautiful irony , and in a beautiful style , how the dreams of man are unattainable . Poictesme is the other side of the sky . It is the world of men 's dreams . The Dorothys of Poictesme are the dreams of woman harbored in the heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life worth striving for  --  the Unattainable . " " You said that you had attained the Unattainable . " " I was speaking metaphorically . But not only women have feet of clay . So have men . I have feet of clay , too . You will learn that some day . " " No , I wo n't . " " That is the most profound illusion under which the human race labors . But what is life without illusions ? That is why I am so annoyed today . The wind  --  goddamn it  --  it tells me that illusions are scattered in the cold frosty glare of reality . Dull , drab reality . Look at us . We are walking in the park , and our heads are filled with illusions and dreams . "  | " I could go on forever like that . " " But life wo n't allow us to . We have illusions and dreams , and we know not whither we go in this life , the only life we will ever know . I walk in the park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Dorothy in Poictesme . And the wind , the dull sky , duller than iron , the cold , everything tells me  --  illusions , illusions . We walk through the land of the Unattainable and our clayey feet weigh down every step of our passage . " " Ed , you know , in a way I agree with you . That 's one reason why I love you . You wo n't give in . Well , neither will I. Ed , darling , I 'll fight the wind with you as long as we have breath , and then we 'll die together . " He smiled at her patronizingly . " We 'll burn the candle at both ends , even though it does n't last the night , " he said . " No , we 'll turn it into an electric bulb . That 's brighter . " " Come on , Ellen , let 's get out of this goddamn park . " " This has been a strange day , " Ellen said , sitting opposite Ed in a prim little tea room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea , Melba toast , and marmalade on the table . He leaned forward with a twinkle in his eye . " So your father thinks I 'm glib ? " " Oh , Ed , I thought we had agreed on that . " " The Babbitts of this world ca n't stand me . " " Ed , do you think my father is a Babbitt ? " " Is n't he ? Are n't all his values the same as Babbitt 's ? What does he consider the good life to be ? Getting ahead , making money . What you and I did today would be inexplicable to him . I was n't up and doing . " " But , Ed , Father belongs to an older generation . " " I have declared eternal war on the Babbitts . Would they mb the stairway of illusions ? So I 'm glib ? No , I merely speak other language . " " Ed , let 's forget poor Father  --  he does n't know any better . "  | " My old man is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quit selling fabrics in a department store . " " When am I going to meet your family ? " " I told you that my brothers and sister are out of town . And I ca n't manage about Father and Mother now . I left home . I have to find a place to stay myself tonight . " " Why did you do that ? " " I 'm fed up living at home . I got my pay from Batten , Fish , O'Doul and Schwartzfield , Inc . So I 'm leaving home . " " Where are you going to live ? " " I 'll find a place . " " I 'll help you . " " But some day I 'll take you to see my mother and father . " " Will they like me ? " " That is incidental . " " Ed , I used to think I was hard . But you 're so much harder . " " Do you disapprove of my hardness ? " " I adore it . I want to be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " " Why ? " " If you 're as hard as me , then I shall have to surpass myself . And if you 're too hard , you wo n't be the pert and lovely girl I have found you to be . " She sipped tea and took a bite of the Melba toast , telling herself that he was too smart . Two couples , students from the University , entered the tea room and took a table at the side opposite Ed and Ellen . Ed 's back was to the group . Ellen did n't look at them , but suddenly she recognized a voice . " Why , Ed , I hear Catherine Anne , " she said . " Yes , I hear her . She 's with some college boys . " Ellen looked over at the group until she caught Catherine Anne 's eye , and then she waved . " Ellen , " Ed said in a low but stern voice . She lowered her eyes and leaned forward . " I ca n't stand college boys . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst a blood vessel , " he said.  | . " Ed , it 's so pleasant here . " " It was pleasant  --  when we were alone . " Ellen wondered whether or not he was afraid to meet Catherine Anne . Did the prospect of such a meeting embarrass him ? Had he loved Catherine Anne ? Ellen asked herself these questions . His reaction was unexpected , and she was uneasy . Ed sensed a change in Ellen and decided that he had to do something . He turned around and casually nodded to Catherine Anne . She smiled at him . " I suppose that I 'll have to go over and say hello to her just for the sake of form , " he said , as if this were a disagreeable necessity which could n't be avoided . " Ed , let 's go over and join them , just to annoy them . I do n't like college boys either . We 'll gripe them , just for the fun of it , " she said , still leaning forward , speaking almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ed talking in such an intimate manner . " You can , if you want to . I do n't want to . I have n't anything to say to half-educated ignoramuses . " " Ed , dear , it might be fun . " " I wanted to be with you alone . I wanted to talk to you , and not to the neighborhood . But if you insist . " His tone changed to one of mockery . " Your slightest wish is my com-mand . " " Let 's , " she said , ignoring his sarcasm . " All right . " Ellen glanced over at the group , again catching Catherine Anne 's eye . " Can we come over and join you ? " she called . Catherine Anne 's face became expressionless , but she nodded rmatively . " Come on , Ed , " Ellen said . Ed nodded , and got up after her . Calm , detached , he reflected that this was a ticklish situation . But he would dominate it . son would always carry himself off well. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellen to her friends , she had seemed cordial . Ed had perceived no sign of anger or embarrassment in her . She was a good sport and she was playing her cards admirably , he observed . Yet he did notice that she avoided meeting his eyes directly , or Ellen 's . In a sense he admired her for her conduct , and yet resented it . He told himself that he believed in a one-way categorical imperative , and he admired his epigram . But then , most of the human race actually believed in that , only they would n't admit it . He felt that he was more honest with himself . There were a few people like his mother who were selfless . Perhaps Catherine Anne was really of this type . But it was the one type that was most dangerous to a man who was walking his own road in his own way . He had tentatively sized up Catherine Anne 's friends . The thin chap on her left was named John Delafield and seemed to be a serious and decent lad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had heard of the other chap at the table , Mike Mooney . Mooney had been a star football player in the Catholic high school league , and when Catherine Anne had been at Saint Paul 's he had paged her seriously . But that had broken up , apparently because Mooney was a dumb Irishman . And Mooney looked the part . Sandy-haired , broad-shouldered , he had a freckled stupid face . The girl with Mooney , Patricia Smith , was just innocent , plump , virginal feminine fluff , a little flapper  --  amusing if there were no better attractions in sight , but that was all . She sat holding a teacup as if the world owed her homage . And she did n't really know the difference between Mike Mooney and the world . He was tempted to throw a bombshell into the group . But he would n't . He would sit back , relax , observe . " Are you on campus , Mr. Lanson ? " John Delafield asked . " No , I never got beyond the eighth grade , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't need to go to college , " Ellen said . She kept her gaze unobtrusively on Catherine Anne . Didp149Catherine Anne really care for Ed ? If so , she did a good job of hiding her feelings . It might be that Catherine Anne was proud . Ellen could not quiet a sudden feeling of admiration for Catherine Anne . But , no , the girl was taking a defeat too easily . Ellen would never do that . She would fight tooth and nail for Ed . But she did n't have to . She glanced at Patricia Smith . Just a child . She felt sorry for both Catherine Anne and Patricia Smith . And think of the difference between Ed and these two boys . Oh , what a lucky girl she was ! " I try to educate myself when the fancy takes me . I read . I dabble in this and that , mainly in philosophy , " Ed said . " Say , I got in a lot of trouble because of philosophy , " Mike said . " Ideas can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year I let my dean talk me into signing up for a course in philosophy . I flunked in it . It was too deep for me . And that 's why I was n't eligible to play on the football team last fall . I planned to go to a lumber camp this summer and get in condition , harden myself . Instead , I have to take courses toake up my grades or I wo n't be eligible for football this fall . is all because I took that philosophy course . It dragged mewn in my grades . " " It 's all so foolish . Who cares about philosophy ? " Patricia ith said . " I do , " Ed said quietly . " Oh ! " she exclaimed illcn glared at her , but Ed nudged Ellen under the table . " All I say is that the course I took was a tough break for me . " Ed saw that John Delafield looked at Mooney as if he were a ild . " I just dabble in philosophy , a little here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Have you ever read Lucretius ? " She returned a blank stare . " Lucretius has written eloquently . I have imbibed his conptfor ignorance , and with it , I would say , some tolerance the ignorant person . "  |p15o  " I took a course in the Stoics . I 'm majoring in philosophy , " John Delafield said . " Yes , I used to be intolerant of ignorance and conceit . Lucretiustaught me to take an aloof attitude toward it . Human ignorance is so abysmal that I 've got to respect it , " Ed said . Catherine Anne was apprehensive . Ellen grinned . Her Ed was so brilliant , and he knew how to put people in their place . " What do you do , Mr. Lanson ? Do you work ? " Patricia Smith asked , flustered . " No , Miss Smith . Did you ever hear of what is called a home girl ? " he asked . " Why , of course . " " I 'm a home boy . Except there are differences in the occupationof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home girl has a limited sphere , a house , an apartment for her activities . A home boy has the universe . The universe is my home , " Ed said . Everyone but Catherine Anne and Ellen looked at Ed. puzzled . " I do n't understand you , " Patricia Smith said . " We 'll forgive that , " Ed said . He drew out a package of cigarettes . " Ed , give me a cigarette , " Ellen said . He handed her the pack , and then lit her cigarette . Patricia Smith and Mike Mooney frowned at her . She was pleased that she had annoyed or shocked them . Ed held the package to Patricia . She shook her head with negative emphasis . " You do n't smoke , Catherine Anne ? " he said , and Catherine Anne also shook her head . " A cigarette , Mr. Mooney ? " Ed asked . " I could n't smoke . We 're having spring practice now and I have to keep in trim . If I smoked and my coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that I had let him down . " Delafield took one of Ed 's cigarettes and thanked him . " You seem to like Lucretius , Mr. Lanson , " he said . " He 's not my favorite philosopher . Nietzsche is . But I admire Lucretius . There is one passage in Lucretius which has alwaysp151struck my fancy . You might remember it . He talks about how sweet it is to stand aloof , on the edge of the world , as it were , watching the little troubled world of human vanities and hopes , the little world of despairs . I do n't remember how the passage goes exactly , but he says something of how pleasant it is to stand as on a darkling plain looking at the distresses of others , not that one necessarily enjoys the suffering of others , but that one is not suffering oneself  --  one is bulwarked against the distresses of others . And then he remarks about the miserable minds of men . What blinded beasts ! " " Mr. Lanson , you must be blase , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that talk . Of course I 'm a Catholic . I do n't think man is a beast , " Mike Mooney said . " Edmond likes a good dispute , " Catherine Anne said . " Oh no , not at all . I would n't try to convince any man , " Ed said . " Say , I have to go or I 'll be late for spring practice , " Mike said . He got up , and Patricia rose after him . " Mr. Delafield , I 've mulled this question over and over many times . When I first read about it , I was skeptical , as skeptical as ou are . At sight it seemed fantastic . But I 've thought about it. weighed it , tested it , and I tried to formulate objections to it . inally I was forced by logic itself to accept this idea . I becamenvinced that Nietzsche 's idea of eternal recurrence is irreftable , " Ed said modestly , his voice seeming to ring withccrity . For a moment Ed shifted his head so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in profile . He faced John DelaIdagain . " Even if what you say were correct , that would not prove absolute validity of this doctrine as a prediction concerning future of the universe , " John Delafield said . Ed did n't understand what he meant . Puzzled , he delayed ing , and to hide his hesitancy he idly lit a cigarette. pI52 " Why ? I do n't follow you , " he said . " I mean merely this . An idea can be logically irrefutable , and nevertheless not necessarily certain in . . . in an existential sense . By that I mean that an idea can be logical and yet not be a warranted truth . " " But it has to be . If it is logical , it is so . " " Ca n't a man argue from false premises ? " John Delafield asked , smiling graciously . " As a matter of fact , I often like to do that , " Ed said , returningthe smile . Ellen felt that she must look , act , talk intelligently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Ed was involved in it . Even though these new ideas did not catch her fancy , she knew she could have gone on in her life without ever having heard of them , and withal , not feeling any loss or deficiency in herself . Had she not felt so before , now she knew that she would be convinced that Ed was brilliant . And just think , he had only gone as far as the eighth grade . Despite his lack of schooling , he could not only hold his own with college students ; why , he could even mop the floor with them . She had thought that this college boy , John Delafield , was nice but naive . Now she was beginning to resent him for daring to disagree so firmly and consistently with Ed . And she kept watching Catherine Anne . Ellen could tell from her expression that Catherine Anne was following the discussion , although sometimes Catherine Anne would seem puzzled . She knew that she had to match Catherine Anne , comment for comment , question for question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be superior to Catherine Anne . She had won Ed , but she had to hold him . Would a person as brilliant as Ed tire of her ? Compared with him , she knew so little . Sometimes this fear was really frightening . But she would n't let him tire of her . Ed was not just brains . He was human , natural , boyish , contradictory . Even so , she had to appear smart and she had to show an interest in his ideas . He seemed to take them so seriously . Catherine Anne was sad , very sad . But she was determinedp153not to show it . Ellen 's presence caused her to feel self-conscious . What had a person like Edmond seen in such a girl ? Ellen Rogers was attractive , but she was not at all serious . Ellen Rogershad never played fair with other persons . But neither had Edmond . Look at what he had done to her . Why had he done it ? She knew in her heart that it had not been the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was just a superficial Edmond , an Edmond who felt that he had to act according to this philosophy . He would change . He would settle down and he would go back to the Church . She was sure of it . But she had lost him . Sometimes she hoped that he would come back to her . But now he was engaged to Ellen . They would probably be married , and it was all over between her and Edmond . A girl like Ellen Rogers might well ruin his life . And there was nothing she could do . She was sad and she was not going to show that she was , especially to a girl like Ellen . The discussion was very interesting , but it worried and concernedher . John Delafield had never been a Catholic , and he did n't believe in God . She would like it so much better if Edmond were doing what she felt he ought to do , defending his religion . She wanted to do it , but in the face of these boys she felt so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had so many answers for everything she said , and all she could do was to fall back on her faith . John was a nice boy , very smart end quick , but she did n't think that he was as brilliant as Edmond . She had lost Edmond . What was it in her that was deficient ? Was it because other girls were loose , free-and-easy ? But Edondhad never tried to take liberties with her . Why ? At mes , although she did n't want him to go too far , she could probably not have resisted him . What was deficient in her ? Ellen Rogers kept watching her . Ellen could do that from w until doomsday and she would not show one sign of disappointment . Ellen had joined them , bringing Edmond along , t to humiliate her . But her humiliation would be kept deep thin her . No one would know of it . Interesting as the discussion was , she wished she had neverp154come here today . She would rather not have seen Edmond and Ellen together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any circumstances . There was something so refreshing about him . And the real Edmond was so misunderstood . She knew the real Edmond . He was worlds apart from the one who had lied to her , deceived her , tricked her out of that forty dollars . And the real Edmond was guilty because the superficial Edmond had done this . She felt that she had to ask questions to show that she was listening and that she was n't a complete dunce . Just as she opened her mouth to speak , Ellen beat her to it . " Ed , what does this mean ? Eternal recurrence , what is it ? " " It 's nothing like the transmigration of souls , is it ? " CatherineAnne asked . Ed smiled condescendingly before answering . " No , it is n't . That 's weak-kneed religiosity . The lunatic fringe of religion believes in nonsense like that . Nietzsche was not a God-creating philosopher ; he was a God-destroying one . " " I do n't understand why you accept such an utterly fantasticidea , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I confessed that I thought so when I firstmet with it . But it is n't . I can show you that it is n't , " Ed said . " But , Edmond , what is it ? " Catherine Anne asked . " First let me explain what this idea means for the girls , if youdo n't object , Mr. Delafield , " Ed said . John Delafield shrugged his shoulders a bit impatiently . He puffed nervously on a cigarette . " According to what Nietzsche wrote on this subject , and I accept it , everything that happens in the world will happen not once , but many times . Everything that happens must happen again . Every manifestation of energy must be repeated . " " Everything ? " Ellen asked . " Yes . That means that once again the four of us will be seated here in this same tea room , having precisely the same argument . And see that dust spot on the table ? " Ed pointed with his left hand . " Even that will re-occur . It will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out to you precisely as I amp155doing now . And when I do , we will all think that it is May , 1925 . We sha n't remember that we have all had this same discussion , not once , but many times before . " " In other words , history is nothing but a phonograph record . It seems to me that the record ought at least to get scratched , " John said . " What a promise that is , " Ellen said , turning toward CatherineAnne . She thought that if what Ed had said were so , it would mean that she would know all the joy of meeting him all over again , of loving him for the first time . In a sense , her love and Ed 's would go on forever . " It 's not a doctrine of hope and optimism . It 's the most pessimisticphilosophy ever developed . " " Nietzsche was n't quite systematic enough to have really formulated a philosophy , " John Delafield interrupted . " Why systems ? I abhor systems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Nietzsche tells us that there will be eternal recurrence , what does he tell us ? Not only that we will live through our joys again , but also that we will live through our sorrows . He tells us that man , miserable , puny , little man will go on forever in his paltry fight for gain , for pleasure , in order to pursue his transparent little games of vanity . His bitter day must be lived over again , not once , not twice , but endlessly , forever . And it is n't only a pessimistichilosophy . It is a brave one . For it says this  --  that no matter ow hard life is , the Superman will face it again , many times , find forever , and the Superman will always say  --  ' Yea ' . " " Nietzsche 's idea of the Superman was the idealization of a physically weak man , influenced strongly by the example of Napoleon Bonaparte . But Bonaparte was n't such a Superman , either . Did you ever read Tolstoy 's portrait of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to John Delafield 's remark , but quickly went on kilt he be tripped up on details of War and Peace . " , John , let 's dispense with formalities . Call me Ed . But to ntinue , you say that this is fantastic . Is it more fantastic thanp156the systems of the philosophers who created their God 's , the philosophers who created as if fictions of synthetic faculties , pretending to be truth-tellers when they were spreading a poisonouslie in the world  --  the lie of a God ? " " That is irrelevant , " John said . Catherine Anne smiled mechanically . Ellen fastened her eyes proudly on Ed . He was now in such extraordinary form . What a day it had been . Being in love with Ed was a succession of endless surprises . " I 'll prove eternal recurrence to you now , " Ed went on . " That 's a big order , Ed , " John Delafield said . " I do n't claim any originality in proving it . What I say is Nietzsche , not me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the object of my search in his vineyard , if I may indulge in a figure . We know about the law of the conservation of energy . " " It does n't prove eternal recurrence . " " Please , let me make my point , and then I 'll listen to your refutation . I am anxious to hear it , but first , let me make my point . " Ellen was impressed by Ed 's politeness and modesty . When he discussed ideas he was so different from what he was when he got into a fight . " According to the law of the conservation of energy , no energy is lost . " He turned to Ellen . " That means that when we die , the energy that constitutes us is not lost . It changes . In the case of beautiful girls like you and Catherine Anne , that energy probably becomes flowers , flowers that the lovers of a future May will pick . " Watching Ellen , Ed did not see Catherine Anne wince and then try to hide her feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impatient . " But persons like myself , their energy will probably turn into onions . " " But what does that prove ? " John Delafield asked . " Just a humorous digression , " Ed said genially . " I do n't believe that . I am a Catholic , " Catherine Anne said . " I 'm not , " Ellen said emphatically.  | " But let 's not get into a religious discussion , " Catherine Anne quickly added . " I sha n't permit myself any more humorous and figurative digressions . Energy never dies . But the sum total of energy in the universe is limited . " " We really do n't know , and we ca n't know , if it is or if it is n't . We ca n't form a total picture of the universe , " John Delafield said . " Then you deny the law of the conservation of energy . If you do that , you say that the world is infinite . If it is infinite , there must be a God . Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand your views , although I think I 've made it clear that I have no sympathy with them . " " No , not at all . All I say is that we ca n't talk about the total universe as you do . " " Will you accept the law of the conservation of energy as a hypothesis for the sake of argument ? " Ed asked . " Obviously . I do n't say that energy is destroyed . I merely pointed out that what you are doing is reducing the world to a kind of monism which padlocks the universe . That is what is wrong with your argument . " " Then you do believe in spirit ? You divide the world into matter and spirit ? " Ellen had grown bored . But she suddenly sat up and feigned interest . Ed turned to her . " Does this bore you ? " he asked Ellen . " Ed , how can you ask that question ? " she replied . " I would n't be guilty of being a bore . I just wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Does this bore you ? " She shook her head that it did n't . " You say , John , that you accept the law of the conservation f energy but you deny eternal recurrence . " " Certainly . There are fields of energy . There are recurrent tterns in the manifestations of energy , the permutations , and c development or happening of events . " " Do you deny the law of cause and effect ? " " What do you mean by cause and effect ? "  |p158Ed  leaned forward and met John 's eyes . This chap was insistent , and he could n't really fathom his mind . He had a definite suspicion that John would pull God out of the bag sooner or later . And he was concerned . He could n't let John make a fool out of him , but he could n't quit the field . He had to win this argument . " What do I mean by cause and effect ? Merely this , that every effect means that it must have a cause . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect , it means that either there was one first cause that set it all going , and that is God , or that it has gone on forever . Since there is no way of proving that there is a God , we must assume that the law of cause and effect has been at work forever . That means that time is infinite . Since time is infinite , and since the law of cause and effect holds , and since energy is conserved and is not infinite , that leads irrevocably to the acceptance of eternal recurrence . " " But you simplify everything . All that we mean by cause is that if an event occurs , it is related to the conditions surroundingits occurrence . " " That means it has a cause . " " No , it means that an event has a past . This view of eternal recurrence is based on nineteenth-century physics . " " Well , what if it is ? " Ed asked , sparring for time . " Nineteenth-century physics , that is , the Newtonian universe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold for high velocities . We know today that there is uncertainty in our knowledge . Briefly , we ca n't be in two places at one time , and therefore we have an irrevocable indeterminacy in our knowledge . Our laws of science are only statistical statements . " Why did this college boy bore her so ? Ed did n't . Ed talked so that she could understand him . But this boy did n't . " This is all beyond me , " Catherine Anne said . " I fear we are boring the girls , " Ed said . John frowned , displeased . He lit another cigarette . " As I was saying , if I may go on without boring the girls in a long discussion of abstruse problems . . . " Ed waited for them to speak.  | " Oh , Ed , do n't pay any attention to me . I 'm learning something , " Ellen said . " Since time is infinite , and since with nineteenth-century physics or any other physics energy is always changing , that means that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many possible combinations of energy . No matter how large that number is , it is limited . With the constant change of manifestationsof energy , sooner or later every possible combination of energy must take place . The world goes on forever , and so everything must happen again . For energy keeps combining in different ways , and nothing remains static , " Ed went on . " You do n't believe that energy can run down and be sta-bilized ? " " If that is possible , it must already have happened , and then we could n't be here . " " How do you know that ? " John asked . " I have just explained how I know it . " Catherine Anne stirred restlessly . " We ca n't say with the certainty that you seem to hold that there will be no new permutations , radical permutations and novel events in the world . We do n't know . The likelihood is t hat there will be . " " Nothing is new under the sun , " Ed said oracularly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recreates itself , " John said . Did this college chap think she was interested in hearing himtell her what some professor told him ? Ellen asked herself . " Your argument , Ed , reminds me of this . If monkeys were ught how to typewrite and put to work twenty-four hours a ay for eternity , then they would eventually produce all theWorks that are to be found in the University library . " " Is n't that silly ? " Ellen asked . Catherine Anne was bewildered . She gazed off , seeing nothing . " If time is infinite , that is possible , " Ed said . " Ca n't there be repetition of the same combinations ? Ca n't rtain concatenations reappear over and over again ? If mon/keys were taught to typewrite , it is probable that in six eternitiesthey would never produce one book that made sense . The number of possible combinations in the letters , numbers , and punctuation marks of the typewriter is very large . It would be unlikely that they would ever hit out many words . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ed said . " No , it would n't . " " But in the long run it would . Because in the long run they would make all the mistakes , and hit upon the gibberish , and exhaust the possibilities of gibberish . " " You 're wrong . Then they would be likely to produce more gibberish . " " I do n't see why , " Ed said . " Ed , I think we ought to go , " Ellen said possessively . Ed did n't miss the possessive note in Ellen 's voice . But he did n't feel like taking umbrage at it now . In time , if it continued , he would set a stop to it . And he was fed up with this argument . The Delafield boy was smart , but why carry on such an argument ? " I have to go , too , " Catherine Anne said . Did he really believe in eternal recurrence ? Sometimes he did . He did n't care about it . It was just an excuse for discussion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we wo n't be boring the ladies , I should like to continue this discussion . It is an interesting problem , " Ed said . " My telephone number is Wentworth 4418 , " John said . Ed copied it down in his notebook . Catherine Anne and John turned to go . A tear slid down Catherine Anne 's cheek , and she glanced aside . She blew her nose . Ellen had caught her action and suddenly she felt sorry for Catherine Anne . She knew what Catherine Anne had lost . She had thought that she would feel so happy in her triumph . But when she had thought this , she had n't really known what love was , what it meant . Now she did . Now she did n't care about such triumphs over other girls.  |p161Having  gained her composure , Catherine Anne smiled goodbye to both of them . Ed and John shook hands , and John and Catherine Anne departed . " Ed , is n't it wonderful ! " " What ? " " To think that in millions of years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be in love all over again . Think of it , we 'll have asterisks for the first time all over again . " " Yes , but suppose that you will have to hear me gab all over again , saying the same things so many times . " " I 'll love it , " she said enthusiastically . " I wonder , " he replied . He ran his hand idly through his hair . " What 's the matter , Ed ? " " I was thinking of some poetry . " " Please recite it for me . " He leaned forward . Placing his head close to hers , he recited in a low but resonant voice . What ails us to fear overmeasure , To praise thee with timorous breath , 0 mistress and mother of pleasure , The one thing as certain as death ? We shall change as the things that we cherish , Shall fade as they faded before , As foam upon water shall perish , As sand upon shore . " That 's lovely , Ed  --  when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me ? " " You will change  --  perhaps . " " No , I wo n't . " " You do n't know . You might find somebody better than me , more attractive , more scintillating  --  somebody like John Delafield . "  | " Ed , you were brilliant today . You were so much more brilliant than he was . " " He really believes in God . " " He does n't interest me . Ed , why do you tell me I 'll change ? " " Because people change . Because I do n't want you to . BecauseI do n't want it to happen . Listen again , Ellen . " Again he recited . I said she must be swift and white And subtly warm , and half perverseAnd sweet like soft sharp fruit to bite , And like a snake 's love lithe and fierce . " He paused , held her in his gaze , and then , as if throwing away the last line of the verse , he continued : Men have guessed worse . " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swinburne . He was not a respectable character . I 'm going to get a copy of his poems and read them to you in the park on the next sunny day . " " Let 's . " " But in the meantime another day is gone , and I must find me a domicile . " " Can I go with you ? " " Yes  --  if you 'll be like a snake 's love , lithe and fierce . " She squeezed his hand . He picked up the check , and they left . Outside , it was almost dark . The wind had abated . " Ed , were you in love with Catherine Anne ? " Ellen asked , taking his arm . " No . She was just a light occupation . She 's too noble . She 's the martyr type . But I sent her a letter this morning . She 'll get it in the mail tomorrow . " " What was it ? " she asked , concerned . " You should n't ask me . " " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't ask me so that I can tell you without havingp163been asked . I sent her a stanza from Swinburne 's poem , Felise . " He halted . " Here is how it goes . " Live and let live , as I will do , Love and let love , and so will I.But , sweet , for me no more with you : Not while I live , not though I die . Good-night , good-bye . " But if you did n't love her , why bother ? " " I 'll tell you why  --  gesture . " Ellen remembered seeing that tear on Catherine Anne 's cheek a little while ago . She vowed that she would never let herself be placed in Catherine Anne 's position with Ed . But hers was so different . Even though she would have to watch so that she would n't be placed in that position , she and Ed really were kindred spirits . She felt so good . So often of late she had felt this way  --  as if it were the very first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poem like that in the mail ? " she asked , her gaiety contradicting her words . " Never ! " She gazed at him enigmatically . " Ellen , all my life has been a preparation , it seems , a preparation for the day when I would meet you . And that has come to pass . Thus spake , not Zarathustra , but Lanson . But now let us not be standing on the sidewalk in the twilight . Let us be up and doing , finding Lanson a domicile . I left my grips at the T.C. station at Sixty-third Street , and we must get them . " They walked on . " What an exciting day it 's been , " Ellen said . " For us life will always be exciting . And we will live dan-rously . " " Is that one of your sayings ? " " No , it 's Nietzsche 's , but it 's my motto . However , our hilosophical friend does n't appreciate it , I fear . What 's his me again ? Oh , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Imagine him living dangerously . "  | He laughed , and broke into song . The girl of my dreams is the sweetest girl .. . He did n't go on singing . " That 's too sentimental . But do you know what ? " " What now ? " " You trust to me and we 'll do everything we want to in ourlife . We 'll obey even our slightest whims . " " Yes , we will . " " And I have one this moment . " " And what is this one ? " " Kiss me . " She kissed him . They strode on briskly toward Sixty-third street.  |p165Ed  and Ellen sat in the rear of Frank Dolan 's Ford . Frank drove slowly along Sixty-seventh Street , toward Stony Island Avenue . A plain-looking girl named Elsie Smithers sat beside Frank . " Ed , what are you doing with that ? " Ellen asked when Ed took a powder puff and mirror out of his pocket . " What 's Hellfire up to now ? " Frank asked without turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powder puff and mirror ? " Ellen asked . " I 'm practicing . " " Sounds to me like a new one from the book of Lanson , " Frank said . " Funny , awfully funny , " Elsie said . " Ed , what are you going to do ? " Ellen asked . " You wait and see . I guarantee that it will be exciting . " " What 's he planning , Ellen ? " Frank asked . " I do n't know . " " Oh , just a little game to drive away the tedium , do n't you now , " Ed said . " Why do they call him Hellfire ? " Elsie asked . " Because the name fits me . " " Oh , I see that you blow your own bugle , " Elsie said . " Yes , and loudly , " Ed said . " I bet Ed just likes to shock people . He likes to be uncontional , " Elsie said.  | " I 'd rather be unconventional than conventional , " Ellen said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I would n't , " Elsie said . " Each to his own choosing , " Ed remarked . " I like people to be ladies and gentlemen , " Elsie said . " Do you know , Elsie , I actually have missed my calling , " Ed told her . " What was that ? " Frank asked . " To be a gentleman . " " I do n't like to make fun of things like that . It 's nice to meet gentlemen , " Elsie said , looking out the window of the moving car . " What do they do , bow and kiss your hand ? " Ed asked . " And talk like foreign princes in a moving picture ? " Ellen added . " Anybody can be . . . crude , " Elsie said . Ed exchanged a knowing glance with Ellen . " Milady , " Ed said to Ellen . " Sir , " Ellen answered . " Methinks we are descending tonight to mingle with the canaille , " Ed said . " But will it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lady Ellen , take caution , pray take caution , and do not allow the hoi polloi to tread upon thy skirts . And above all , pray take guard lest it not breathe foul breaths into thy fair face , corrupting thy noble nostrils . And now , milady , pray pardon me because methinks that I must give my nose a loud and noble lordly sneeze . " He burlesqued a sneeze and blew his nose dramatically . " Milady , I like to see a man blow his nose with gusto , " Ed said . Ellen laughed . " Say , is this a game ? " Frank asked , driving on . " No , just a lot of plain unadulterated crap , " Ed said . Elsie swung around and tried to sting Ed and Ellen with a glance . She turned back , not speaking . Ellen put her hand in Ed 's as they both smiled  | " Elsie , I have a suspicion , " Ed said . " What ? " she asked . They occupied a table by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was opposite them . There was a fair-sized midweek crowd . " I have a suspicion that you do not approve of me . " " Ed , of course she does , " Frank chirped in promptly and in a conciliatory voice . " " Why do you say that ? You talk awful funny , " Elsie told him . " Funny . Yes , that 's the right word . That 's me , just a clown , " Ed said . " I do n't think that . Not at all . " " Of course you think . " " Does n't everybody think ? " Elsie asked . " I do n't . And do you know why ? " " That 's funny . Why ? " " Because everybody else does . Just catch me doing what everybody else does . " " I never met anybody else like you , " Elsie said , beginning to thaw . Ed laid his powder puff and mirror on the table . " What 's that for ? " Elsie asked . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " After the next dance I shall walk off the floor powdering my nose and prancing like a fairy . " " What do you want to do that for ? " Elsie asked . " It 's an experiment . " " What do you mean ? " Frank asked . " I want to find out if any so-and-so in this place does n't like what I do . " " Suppose you find out , Ed ? " Frank asked . " If a female objects to my conduct , then I shall do nothing . Disapproval is the privilege of the fair sex . But if a male disap- proves and let 's out one bat , I shall walk up to him nonchalantly , do n't you know , and merely tee off on him . " " Ed , just for a change , let 's not have any fights tonight , " Ellen urged . " Ed , what 's the use of doing it ? It is n't worth it . But , of course , if you do get into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'll stick by you . You know that . But I do n't see any use of starting one , " Frank said . " I do n't propose to start any fights . All that I shall do is to stroll casually off the dance floor , powdering my nose . When I was a boy , I was told that this is a free country . But I 'm from Missouri . I want to find out , put it to a test to see if this is or is not a free country . Am I allowed to powder my nose in public and to comport myself as if I belonged to the neuter gender ? " " What 's that mean ? " Elsie asked . Frank showed his embarrassment . " You do n't know what a fairy is , Elsie ? " Ed asked . " No , I do n't know what you 're talking about . " " Did you ever hear of a man being in love with another man ? That 's what a fairy is , " Ellen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " The Greeks and Romans liked it , " Ed said . " Ed , listen to me . What 's the use of pulling off a stunt like this . We 're having a good time as it is , are n't we ? You know if you do , I 'm with you to the end , but I do n't see the use of doing it , " Frank argued . " Frank , look around this place . Notice the people here , playingat having a good time . Right on a line from me at that table there , I spy a false face in a gray suit , and with him a fluffy and vacuous head in an organdy dress . Observe them closely . Look at the smirk on his face . Look at the superior expression and manner of his broad . Are they having a good time ? The answer is no . But if I do something to give them a little fun , pep up the evening for them , why , I 'm being their benefactor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good time ? " Elsie said . " Looks are not deceiving , not in this instance , " Ed told her.  | " Judging from the looks of that particular person , Ed , darling , I 'd guess that no one could have a good time with him . If you ask me , he looks like wood dressed up in an installmentplansuit , " Ellen said . " Ed , I still do n't think you ought to do it . You and Ellen are engaged , and if you get in fights over such matters , you 'll both get a bad name . It wo n't reflect right on either of you , " Frank argued . " That does n't worry me . But , Ed , dear , I 'll be afraid if you get into a fight . I do n't want you to be injured . " " That 's no cause for worry . " The orchestra began playing . To Frank 's dismay , Ed led Ellen onto the dance floor . " Have you noticed my pal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What in particular ? " " He 's giving us a wide berth on the dance floor . In case anytrouble starts , he 's going to be on the other side of the floor , too far away to come to my aid . My pal , Frank , oozes bravery . " " Darling . I do n't like him . " " Everything has its uses , my dear . " " Ed , I 'm afraid . What you plan to do is amusing , clever . But I do n't want you getting into fights where you can be hurt . " " Do you think that the puny sticks miscalled men in this establishment could hurt me ? Do you think that the specimens of flaming youth on this dance floor could injure me ? Where is your sense of humor , Sweet ? " " Ed , darling , I love you . I ca n't even stand the idea of yourbeing hurt , the thought that anything could happen to you . " " I give you my word of honor that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't give it lightly . But I give it . That settles thequestion . Now I ca n't be hurt . " He accidentally stepped on her toe . " Oh , I 'm sorry . " " It 's nothing . "  | " I 'm a lousy dancer . " " Ed , it 's not so . " " It is . I dance too jerkily . But I 'm going to learn to dancebetter . However , a good dancer is a sign of a misspent youth . " " Who said that ? " " Lanson . " " Lanson says so much . I could listen to what he says forever . " " Lanson is merely glib . " " Ed , please do n't rag me because of my father . I 'm not responsiblefor him . " " Has n't it dawned on you that he might be right ? Perhaps I am just glib . " " Stop that , " she said , lightly tapping his back . " I still observe that Frank is busy keeping clear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't you ? " " Everything that I should n't , and nothing that I should . " " Ed , please do n't get in a fight tonight . " He smiled at her . He began singing loudly on the dance floor . Oh , they called her frivolous Sal , a peculiar sort of a gal . Following the last encore , the dancing couples drifted off the floor . " Come on , Ed , " Ellen said , stepping ahead of him . Ed did not follow her . He drew out his powder puff and mirrorand nonchalantly dabbed at his nose and cheeks . Ellen looked back . Momentarily , she was frightened . Then she laughed . She stepped back to his side and glared right and left as if to cut and freeze anyone who cast a disapproving eye at Ed . The dancers continued drifting off the floor , heedless of Ed as he again dabbed his face with the powder puff . Those who did notice him passed on , unimpressed . No one laughed at Ed or paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attract attention , Ed burlesqued his actions . He powdered his nose again with elaborate and exaggeratedgestures . Still dabbling his nose , he minced off the floor ,  |p171swaying  his hips and buttocks and making sounds with his lips . This gained no attention ; even the Chinese waiters refused to notice him . When they reached their table , they found Frank tense and nervous . Elsie was annoyed . Laughing uproariously , Ed and Ellen sat down . Persons at near-by tables stared , but when Ed looked about fiercely , no one met his eye . " This is . . . Humoresque , " he said , still laughing . Elsie sat stiff , upright . She blushed . Frank 's shoulders sagged , expressing how helpless he felt . Ellen and Ed continued to laugh , but he held his left fist cocked waiting for any stranger to make a remark about him . No one did . Ed turned from the wash bowl in the men 's room and dried his hands . " Frank , are you holding ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I just discovered before signaling for you to come here to the crapper with me that I left my dough back in the hotel . I have n't a sou on me . I do n't know how I forgot my wallet . I laid it on my dresser when I cleaned up . I guess that in rushing out it just slipped my mind . Can you take care of the bill for me ? I 'll repay you as soon as I get back to the hotel and fetch my money . " " I 'm glad to help you out . " " Frank , can you manage it this way ? I do n't want to look like a deadbeat in front of the girls . Can you let me take the money for my share and I 'll pay it when the Chink gives us the bill ? " Frank drew out his wallet and looked in it . " The smallest I 've got is a five . Here , take it , and give me the change . " " Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accepting the fivedollarbill.  | When they were leaving and received the bill from the Chinesewaiter , Ed flung his five on the table . Frank did likewise . " Get us change , " Ed said . The waiter returned with the change . Ed left fifty cents on the tray and pocketed the balance of the five dollars he 'd just borrowed . They left . By the hat-check stand at the stairway leading down to the street Ed nudged Frank . They allowed the girls to drift downstairs ahead of them . " Frank , would you mind if Ellen and I walked home ? " " I can drive you just as easy . " " I know , but I want to talk to her . I have something to discussalone with her . " " Marriage ? " " No , not that . Something personal . Not anything you might suspect . Ellen is n't that kind of a girl . But I want to talk to her , you understand , do n't you ? " " Of course . " " Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tomorrow . I 'll give you a buzz at six , how 's that ? " " All right , Ed . " They followed the girls downstairs . " I told Frank we preferred walking , " Ed said , strolling along Sixty-third Street away from The Palm Tree Inn . " Ed , you were such a scream walking off the dance floor , " Ellen said , hanging onto his arm . " I was waiting , ready to let go , too . And not one measly bastard had the guts to crack wise at me . " " If Elsie heard that , she 'd disapprove . " Ed laughed heartily . " What 's the joke ? " Ellen asked was just thinking  --  perhaps Frank is petting Elsie now . " He laughed . " Imagine necking a cake of ice . "  |p173They  both laughed . " Ellen , you take this key and go up to my hotel room first . I 'll follow you . You just skip by the desk quickly . No one will bother you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I almost forgot something . " He took out his notebook and stopped under a lighted window . With a stub of pencil he marked down Frank Dolan 's name and , after it , five dollars . Then he added the amount to the total of his listed debts and smiled . " A telephone number ? " Ellen asked . " No , just high finances . This is my account book . " " May I see it ? " " Little girls should n't trouble their little brains with high finances . It disturbs their looks . In this family I 'm the financial wizard . " " Sometimes you talk in riddles . " " I 'm a riddle . The riddle of the universe . " " If anybody else said that , it would n't be proper . If you say it , it 's wonderful . " " The hell with riddles . Let us move on , " he said , taking her arm . He broke into song : And when I told them how beautiful you were , They would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in his BVD 's . He sat on his unmade bed smoking a cigarette , his lips curled into a smile . He brushed back a curly lock . It was an ordinary hotel room . On the dresser in a corner he had set up a Gideon Bible as his altar . It was flanked by two gin bottles , and before it he had placed a package of cigarettes and a tray full of butts and ashes . His altar amused him . It had amused Ellen , also . His week in this room was up today , and that created a new problem . But problems were easily settled . This one was particularlysimple . It offered two alternative solutions . He could pay his hotel bill . Or he could not pay it . What could be more simple ? The first solution required money . He had no money . Therefore events forced him to adopt the second alternative . He went to the closet and got out his little notebook . Sitting at the desk , he wrote down the amount of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and added this sum to his total list of debts . His problem was settled . Now all he needed to do was to leave the hotel . Ed dragged his suitcase out from under the bed . Every time he had left the room , he had locked it , and on one side he had pasted a thin strip of adhesive tape so that he could detect if the suitcase had been opened in his absence . He observed that the tape was in place . All was well for Lanson . He unlocked the grip . Inside , there were three shirts , an extra suit of BVD 's , three ties , two pairs of dirty socks , three Chicago telephone directories and a stack of newspapers . The extra paper had given his suit/case weight , and when the bellhop had carried it upstairs to show him his room , it had seemed as if he had a grip full of clothes . That had saved him the inconvenience of being asked to pay his bill in advance . It was a card all right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use in the world . They could be of help when you were defrauding a hotel . He smiled at this thought , and flicked ashes on the rug . He took his clothes out of the grip and laid them on the bed . He dressed , putting on two suits of underwear and four shirts . He stuck the extra ties and socks in his coat pockets . Then he carefully locked the suitcase , and shoved it under the bed . He pulled it out and , for the gesture , put another strip of tape on one side . He shoved it under the bed a second time . Studying himself in the mirror , Ed was pleased with his husky appearance . And he did n't think that he would look suspicious , even though the extra shirts caused noticeable creases near his collar . A dumb hotel clerk would n't be observant enough to draw any deductions from these creases . He could idly drift out of the hotel , and then , for all eternity , it would never have further dealings with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be back where he was this minute , gypping the Tudor Hotel once again . Now , did he honestly believe in eternal recurrence ? It was a fascinating speculation . It impressed most people when he explained it to them , even if it had n't impressedDelafield . And it was more plausible to believe in and accept than God . But that was another department of human interest , and it was not on the order of the day . He was all ready now , fully prepared to say good-bye , hail , farewell , Ave atque Vale to the Tudor Hotel . He had enjoyed its comforts and conveniences for a week , but one had to be on the move . New fields of exploration were always open . New hotels , new boarding houses awaited him . He lit a fresh cigarette and left his room , slamming the door . He took the elevator down . Emerging from it , he told himself that what he ought to do was to walk right out , quickly , but without creating any suspicion . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again going to return to this hotel , inas/much as he and this establishment were parting forever , he should not make his departure precipitous . He strolled to the desk . The clerk was busy sorting mail . " Good morning , Mr. Devoe . " " Good morning , " Ed answered the clerk . " Here , I have a letter for you . " The clerk passed the letter to Ed . He had written it to himself , trying to disguise the handwriting . It made him seem more reliable if he received mail . " Mr. Devoe , you 've forgotten to settle your bill . " " Did I ? I forgot to attend to it . I 'm going out on a business appointment now , and then I 'll cash a check . I 'll be back at lunch time and I 'll settle it then . I 'm staying here another week . Business is pretty good . " " That 's all right . I 'm glad to hear that business is good , Mr. Devoe . " Ed turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand in his pocket , pulled out the key , and laid it on the desk . He sauntered off . He was starting to sweat because he was so well clad . He took out a handkerchief and mopped his face . He left the hotel and , turning the corner of Sixty-fourth Street , he strode on toward Sixty-third . Now the problem was to find another room in which to stay for the coming week . However , it was not yet lunch time . Why concern oneself with such a question so early in the day ? Why concern oneself when the sun was shining , heralding the summer that would soon arrive , particularly when he had a girl like Ellen . She was wonderful , and all of the other adjectives . Iri his fashion , he truly loved her . He would never forget the Tudor Hotel , not merely because it was now on his creditor list . However , he 'd have to keep this fact in mind now , and not walk past it lest he be seen by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that connected with filthy lucre why he would never forget the Tudor Hotel . Ellen had been lovely in that hotel with him . He strolled along Sixty-third Street , smoking a cigarette , swinging his arms , sweating.  |p177He  got out a suitcase he 'd checked at the Illinois Central stationand lugged it to the lavatory . There he was alone . He undressedin a toilet booth and put on fresh underwear and a fresh shirt , which he took from the suitcase he had checked . He stuffed his spare clothing into this grip . He was now comfortable . He rechecked the grip and went outside . He walked on to a near-by Greek restaurant and sat down to eat ham and eggs , coffee and doughnuts . After breakfast , his total capital would be twenty cents . That created another problem . Money . He could n't touch Frank Dolan right off because of that five spot he 'd borrowed from him at the Palm Tree Inn the other night . He 'd explained it to Frank , though , telling him that he 'd gotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty bucks , and then had a streak of bad luck . Frank was his chump . Frank believed him . He could telephone Ellen and see her this morning . He was inclined to , but it would n't be the best strategy . Strategy and technique were as necessary in love as in war . So let her sit home and wait for him to call her . And let there be no call . Absence makes the heart grow fonder . Let her think of him . That would n't do her any harm . He finished his breakfast in leisurely fashion . He signaled for a second cup of coffee . Suddenly he realized that he had forgottensomething . He 'd meant to steal the Gideon Bible at the hotel and he 'd left the room without it . He must not be so carelessthe next time . The waitress brought him his coffee . He put sugar and milk in the cup and stirred the coffee . He lit a cigarette . There was nothing like a hearty breakfast and a good cigarette on a spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He told himself that the gods could be no happier than he was at this moment . After breakfast Ed stood in front of the restaurant , indecisive . But he recalled that there was a branch public library at Kimbark Avenue , so he ambled down to it . He had n't beenp178doing much reading of late , and he ought to spend more time in the library . There was a reading room in the front of the library . Having found a copy of Thus Spake Zarathustra , Ed selected a chair at a table where he would be opposite a cute girl who was reading and making notes with a stack of books in front of her . Ed took out a notebook and pencil and began thumbing through the book . He had read it once , and now he was skimmingit , looking here and there for sentences , insights , thoughts that would refresh his memory . His attention was caught by a short paragraph in the first portion of the book . He read and reread it several times with mounting enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sentence in his note-book : Behold the good and the just ! Whom do they hate most ? Him who breaketh up their tables of values , the breaker , the law-breaker :  --  he , however , is the creator . He glanced at the ceiling reflectively . The noble law-breaker . What a mission to perform ! After skimming through more pages , he copied down another sentence . Ah , my brother , bast thou never seen a virtue backbite and stab itself ? He never ceased to marvel at Nietzsche 's passion , insight , hard thinking. . .. bast thou never seen a virtue backbite and stab itself ? Link this with Freud and think of young virgins from good homes . Think of religious people who prayed throughout their lives , did not their " virtue " backbite and stab itself , turning into hypocrisy , into pride and arrogance , into intolerance against the sinner and the unbeliever ? This single sentence of Nietzsche 's was like a door opening up whole avenues of insight and reference . He thumbed on , thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of aphorisms , thoughts , mottoes , insights , a newp179Nietzschean work . It would n't be systematic . And that meant that that fellow , Delafield , would n't consider it philosophy . Why be systematic ? Nonsense . He did n't want his book to be systematic . It would be fragmentary , but full of darts and arrows , lightning flashes . He was n't yet ready to write it . He had to think , concentrate , work hard , correlate thoughts and experiences . But good hard work of this kind would do him good . The only question was how he could support himself . But that was not the proper question to ask himself in a library . How would he support himself ? This , properly speaking , was a crossreference . It was a problem to be handed over to someone else . Ellen ? Why not ? Then , after he finished his book , he would get a job , marry her , and . . . Did he want to marry her ? Did he really want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone around the world . How could he surpass Pierre if he were tied down ? Where was Pierre now ? Pierre had introduced him to Nietzsche . But he and Pierre never did get along . The rivalry between them was too intense . Pierre did n't like it because he usually took Pierre 's girls away from him . Well , Pierre was somewhere east of Suez this very minute . Some day , to go to the East ! But he did love Ellen , after his fashion . He thumbed through the book some more and , coming on the final paragraphs of the first part , there was a rising excitementwithin him . He remembered how he had been exalted , thrilled , emotionally energized when he had first read this sectionin the Chicago Public Library at Randolph and Michigan . He had compared that experience to sex and called it an intellectualorgasm , but it was not an apt comparison . His mind had been on its toes , just as he was on his toes when he was in a fight . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . He had associated them with sunshine and he had vaguely imagined himself climbing yellow mountains of sunshine , climbing to heights where there were undefined experiences awaiting him , experiences laden with all sorts of promises and thrills.  |p180He  read again the words that had so stimulated him . And it is the great noontide , when man is in the middle of his course between animal and Superman , and celebrateth his advance to the evening as his highest hope : for it is the advance to a new morning . On rereading , these words had a diminished effect upon him . The cliffs of sunlight to be scaled seemed less vivid . The words were more like words , less like inexplicable sensations , inexplicablecalls to self-realization . He was disappointed in them . He read the remaining two paragraphs on the page . At such time will the down-goer bless himself , that he should be an over-goer ; and the sun of his knowledge will be at noontide . " Dead are all the Gods : now do we desire the Superman to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great noontide ! Thus spake Zarathustra . Now , these words which had once stirred him evoked a mood of nostalgia . Gone , perhaps gone forever , was the thrill he had known the first time he had read this same passage . He longed to recapture his sensation from that experience , his sense of elationthat he used to be able to call forth from that same stimulus . But he could not do it . The words had less effect on him , his reaction was less intense , and his images had become less vivid . Often the words which stimulated a man played a role in his inner life , went through the same cycle as did a woman . Just as a woman lost her capacity to give him pleasure and amuse him , so did the same words , on being reread , lose their magic power to stimulate , ennoble , lift him upward to an inner plane of rare experience . He glanced up from his book and noticed the girl opposite him . She was a cute little trick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning , or the noontide , he told himself . Catching her eye , he smiled charmingly . At first she acted as if she did not see him . Then her face changed , broke into a childlike smile.  | " You 're working hard , " he said in a half-whisper . " So are you . " A girl who worked in the library came by the table and shushed them . He took out his cigarettes and nodded in the direction of the door . She followed him outside . Ed walked toward Jackson Park with the girl , Betsy . He was gratified because of his characteristic good fortune . Just as he 'd come away from the library , he had met Eddie Dill , a friend of Musty Mulligan and one of the boys who hung around Sixtythirdand Stony Island , and he 'd been able to bum two dollars off Eddie . He was going to while away the time until lunch , take Betsy to eat , and then he 'd call Ellen and see her . Not that he loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul to be kept home waiting to hear from him . She was getting too possessive about him . He glanced at the girl by his side . Sweet and young  --  a virgin . A lovely flower to pluck and wear in your coat for a day or so . But he would leave this flower unplucked . He 'd merely talk with her in order to while away the morning . " I 'm a bad influence , " he said . " Do n't say that . I do n't like to have to work so hard on my term paper , " she said . Ed thought that this girl had better watch out or her virtue would certainly backbite and stab itself in the back . " I 'm a bad influence nonetheless , taking you away from your work , " he said . " I 'll go back to it . The air wo n't hurt me . " Seducing a virgin satisfied the ego more than it did the aesthetic sense . The world should be so organized that this task was departmentalized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to doctors to be vaccinated . " I should be working , too , " he said . " It must be hard to write a book . " " I do n't think so . " " Some people write books , and look at the time I have writingp182a term paper , and my old teacher , Mr. Weber , he 'll probably give me a C if I 'm lucky . " " How did you happen to come down to this library instead of going to one at the University ? " " Oh , I never get a thing done in Harper , that 's the library at school . I always see some girl I know , and we get to talking , and first thing you know we 're not studying , and maybe we 're going to the Coffee Shop to get hot chocolate . But I have to write my term paper . I must pass in my courses . If I flunk out , my Daddy will be mad at me . " According to Zarathustra , woman was the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Even Ellen was n't really a dangerous plaything , but she was a closer approach to danger than any other girl he 'd ever loved . " Tell me about yourself , Betsy , " he said as they crossed Stony Island Avenue to go into Jackson Park . " I 've never known a person named Algernon before , " the girl said . " It is an unusual name . It 's an aloof name , lacking in the same friendliness as the human note of Elizabeth or Betsy . It does n't have the same character to it as your name does , " Ed told her . They were near the Jackson Park lagoon and they heard the swish of oars as someone passed in a rowboat . Betsy sat prim and stiff , her legs together , her dress smoothed out neatly . Ed lay on the grass facing her , his coat carefully folded beside him . " It 's too bad , " Betsy said sympathetically . " It 's nothing . " His manner was cavalier . " It 's nothing . Others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He glanced at the lagoon where the sun created a dazzling and jewel-like surface on the calm water . He turned back to Betsy . " After all , what did I sacrifice ? " She listened intensely . He had impressed her , and he could perceive that she hung on his every word , believed what he was telling her . It was amusing . The female of the species was sop183credulous . Of course , Betsy was just a child . How could a girl remain so innocent in her sixteen , seventeen , eighteen years ? But this was a charming little experience , something to pass the time while Ellen learned to care for him by the absent treatment . " I do n't think that I can even call it a sacrifice . My fatherwants me to work in his office , and to be a junior executive . ButI loathe business . I will be an artist or nothing in this world . " " You must n't lose confidence in yourself , " she told him . " It 's kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know you will be successful , " she said . He fixed his eyes on her . She lowered her head , and a blush came to her plump cheeks . She smoothed out her dress . He smiled , amused , sardonic . " As I was saying , Betsy , I have sacrificed little . A job that I do n't want . I could have money , but then I am an austere and frugal person and I have few needs . I could drive around in my own automobile , a sports roadster like many of the young wastrels in the city . My brothers do . But is that giving up anything ? I would n't say so . " " But it is nice , is n't it , to have a car of your own . . . Algernon , " she said , pronouncing the name self-consciously . " I suppose it has its conveniences , but we do have two feet and we can walk on them . Many chaps my age have their own cars , just as my brothers do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had sports ' roadsters ? I might not be rememberedand I know that . But I will give up everything to achieve my purposes . No , I ca n't say that my sacrifices to literature are really consequential . " " Yes , yes they are . What you are doing is very brave . " He lit a cigarette and gazed off at the silvery lagoon , morose , glum . " You seem unhappy , " she said , touched . He faced her , smiling graciously , his mood changing instantaneously . " No , not at all . I was thinking of my work . You must forgive me . At the oddest moments , ideas , phrases , incidents occur to me. "  | " It must be very hard to be a writer . I know it is , because I know how much trouble I have to go through to write a term paper . " It is , and it is n't . It is the only life worth living . At all events , that 's what it means to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have given up is nothing , nothing of the slightest signifi-cance . " " Ca n't you explain it to your father so that he 'll understand ? " she asked . " No , I do n't think that I can . You see , my differences and misunderstandings with my father go back a number of years . When I was sixteen , I was in college . " She listened with awe . " Yes , I was at Harvard at sixteen . But I saw nothing in that moth-eaten establishment that would help me in my career as a writer . I quit . I had a row with my father . But I would n't go back to college . Ever since , we have never gotten on , and he has never been sympathetic to my work . " " That 's too bad . " " Oh , what can you expect from a businessman ? " " My Daddy is a businessman , but he 's nice . He is , he 's nice . And he reads , he reads all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , my battle is almost won . I am finishing my book . It is just about written . " " I know that it will make you famous , too . I just know it will . " " I do n't seek fame and fortune . I seek , in my humble way , to discover truth , and to record it . But I want your help , if I may ask for it . " She was too flustered to answer him . There was a twinkle in his eyes . " Betsy , tell me , do you think I should publish my book under my own name , or should I use a pseudonym ? " " I would n't know . " " What do you think of my name ? Do you think it 's a good name to be used by the author of a book ? "  |p185She  thought for a moment . He watched her , giving the impression that he was anxiously waiting for her answer . " I like it . Yes , I do . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that name on a book , I think I would remember it . " " That settles my problem . I am grateful for your aid in solving it . " " But it 's nothing , " she said , girlish , shy . The sun slanted across her round and vapid face . He observed her closely . She seemed to be out of something other than life . How could a girl be so dumb ? But it would be a shame to change her . She should be put on display in a museum . She was too young to play around with . Seducing her would be like seducingan infant . For while she had a neat and developed body , her emotions , her mind , were years younger . And yet in a few years this girl would become scheming , crafty , bourgeois , and dull , unspeakably dull . Why was he wasting his time telling her a cock-and-bull story ? But why not ? It suited his fancy . " What is your book about ? " she asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not a plot story , and it does n't have a happy ending . It is a kind of chronicle , and it is a sort of philosophical novel . It seeks to depict the romance of reality , and the reality of romance , " he said , and she was unable to mask her bewilderment . " It is set in a strange and imagined land which I call Fantasia . I place this land on the other side of the moon . " " You must have imagination to write a book like that . " " The main character is a young knight , and just as knights used to seek the holy grail , he is a seeker . He has a dream of fair women . But each fair damsel disappoints him , disillusions him . He seeks , but he does n't find . With all the trappings of romance , I try to depict emotion realistically . " " I 'll bet it will be interesting . " " This is not the kind of an age for such writing . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roadsters , bank accounts , that 's the thing . "  | " You 're an idealist . You know , I am an idealist , too : I am . " " I believe you , " he said solemnly . She smiled a shy invitation . Twelve o'clock whistles began to fill the air . " Would you like to have lunch with me ? " he asked . She shook her head girlishly . He rose and held out his hand to her . He pulled her up , embracedher , kissed her . She blushed and turned her head away from him . " You are very sweet , Betsy . " She did n't answer . " Let us go and have lunch , " he said . Still flustered , she coyly took his arm . He guided her across the driveway and toward a park exit . Betsy , he thought  --  Betsy , a droll little episode . " Ed , why did n't you call me ? I waited all morning for you to , " Ellen said , angry . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rove about her . It suddenly occurred to her that she and Bill Northrup had sat on this very same bench that morning she had kept him waiting so long , making him think that he had to marry her . What a coincidence ! Then she had suffered from ennui . She had not even realized what happiness was around the corner . But from then to now , roles had been reversed . She had made Bill wait . Now she 'd had to do the waiting . But it was not the same . And she did n't want to think such thoughts . They contained a possible prophecy she did n't want to face . " Why did n't you call ? " she asked . " I can explain , but you should n't ask me in such a peremptorytone , " he said quietly . " I did n't mean it that way . " " I had you on my mind all morning . I wanted to telephone you , but I could n't . I had to attend to important matters . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to get caught . "  | " But after you.got out , could n't you have telephoned me ? " " Theoretically , yes . But I could n't because I was distracted . I did n't want to call you in a distracted mood . " " Distracted ? " she asked him . He stared off at the blue sky , moody . He had to make his expressions match his words . But he thought of what had happened . This morning he had been with one girl at one spot in Jackson Park . This afternoon he was with another girl , in anotherspot of the same park . " I waited all morning for you to call . You promised me you would . " " What do you think I was doing  --  flirting with somebody else so early in the day ? Ellen , I ca n't stand jealousy . If you do n't believe me and trust me , well , we might as well call it quits now . " " What is this , an invitation ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worship you . If you deserted me , you can not begin to imagine how distraught I should be . I would almost go out of my head . " He stopped speaking to kiss her . Holding her in his arms , he said : " Ellen , you must trust me . And if you do , we 'll conquer . But I ca n't buck the whole world and then feel that you disbelieve in me . " He withdrew from the embrace and dropped his arms in his lap . His shoulders drooped in dejection . Ellen forgot that he had not given her any specific reasons to account for not having telephoned her . She was fearful , but her gaze was tender and loving . " Ed , I 'm sorry . " She kissed him affectionately . " Ellen , I spent this morning pondering , ruminating over many matters . I 'm fed up . I 'm fed up with this idea of frittering away my time . I 'm going to get some decent work done . And then I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would come to this decision . " 1 le looked at her strangely.  | " But , darling , what 's wrong ? " she asked , observing the change in his expression . He broke into a smile . " Yes , I 'm going to put my nose to the grindstone . And at the same time I 'm going to write a book . I 'm going to make enough money to keep you in style by fall , and then we 'll do all of the things we want to . Why should I go on frittering away my time ? It does n't make sense . " " Ed , dear , I love you for yourself . But , my darling , we ought to think about what we 're going to do . And I want you to show my father , too . " " Has he been talking against me again ? " " Not exactly . He just says that he 's from Missouri . " " Goddam it ! Damn him , trying to poison you against me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . You know Father . He 's just what you said he is  --  a Babbitt . " " Listen , Ellen , before I cash my chips in I 'll show plenty of people , plenty more people than him . Ellen , I have a plan . " " Yes , darling . " " Here , I 'm disintegrating . I have to go away and get a new start . That 's how I will have to make my mark . And when I do that , I 'll send for you . " " But , Ed , you mean leaving Chicago , without me ? " " Do you trust me ? " " You know I do , you know it , darling . " " You believe in me ? " She squeezed his hand in answer . " I 'm going to New York . I 'll get on my feet there . Would n't you rather live in New York ? " " Yes , if you are there with me . " " Ellen , I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the first stage with me , living in cheap rooms , eating bad food , suffering all the worries and frustrations that inevitablycome to one when one sets out to crack a strange town . " " Ed , dear , why ca n't I go through it if you do ? Why ca n't I ? What kind of a person am I if I ca n't ? " " I 'll have to consider it all further . But I 'll settle everythingp189in short order . And we 'll be married and do what we want . Whim will be our God , and I 'll enthrone it . Whim will be God , Whirl will be King , and Ellen will be Queen . " " You say such charming things , " she said , but there was a touch of sadness in her voice . He patted her cheek and kissed her . " Darling , did you get a new room yet ? " she asked . " No , but I shall . " " Do you want to come home with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , pulled her after him , and with his arm around her , they walked toward Ellen 's home.  |p190The  pitch black night , like a piece of cardboard , was pasted against Ellen 's bedroom window . The quiet was absolute , and she lay in bed remembering how , during the afternoon , she and Ed had been together in this same bed . Had she ever been more happy than this afternoon ? Had it been the realization that he was going away , that they would part for a while , that had made their love more tender , and , at the same time , more passionate ? She loved Ed , and he was going away . A mood of sadness took possession of her . What would she do without him ? Just a moment before , the darkness of the evening had been the background of memories of love . Now the melancholy that invaded her poured out of her being and spilled , like ink , over her room , over the world that stood beyond her opened window . The darkness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thoughts of parting . Why could n't he get on his feet here in Chicago and not have to leave her ? She could see clearly now that Ed was his own worst enemy . He was not easy to understand . So often he changed from one mood to another . Ed was such a boy , such a child  --  her child . She had to take care of him . But he was going away where she could n't do this . So many things could happen to him . Suppose that some girl in New York should cast her net for him ? Could he resist ? If he resisted , and the girl were smart , all she needed to do was to dare him . He would n't refuse a dare because he was such a boy . But if he would n't refuse a dare from a girl , did n't that mean Ed did n't really love her ?  |p191Sometimes  she was not sure of his love . It was difficult at times to know when he meant what he said and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love and his affections there would be a mocking , ironic note in his voice . But he must be in love with her . This afternoon he could n't have been so tender if he did n't love her . Ellen turned onto her left side and curled up . Even though he did n't meet with dangers , even though he did n't fall in love with any other girl , it would still be sad . She would not see him every day . She would be alone , without him . Life would be so empty while he was away from her . Why did he have to go away ? What could she do to stop him ? She could n't tell him that she did n't want him to go , because he could n't be handled that way . If he was commanded to do something , his spirit of contrariness flared up . Should she pretend that she was sick ? Or should she tell him that she was going to have a baby ? Could she succeed with Ed with such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She thought of how she and Ed would cut a figure in New York . She had no clear idea of what it would be like . There were many skyscrapers there , and Riverside Drive was supposed to be quite nice . They would live on Riverside Drive . Then she would be so happy . But between such a time and now there was the intervening period when she would be separated from Ed . How would she be able to go on from minute to minute , from hour to hour , from day to day ? It would be ghastly . This morning , when she had waited for him to telephone her , she had been the prey of so many fears ; she had been so miserable . How much worse would it be with Ed in New York . He had grown into her life . She and Ed were part of each other . And suppose their parting was to be forever . She could n't bear such a thought . But need she entertain it ? It would n't be forever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why did he have to go away ? She realized , in asking herself this question , that she had made mistakes with Ed . She had allowed him to gain the upper hand . But perhaps that was the nature of love , and to love meant to allow the one you loved to have the upper hand over you . If so , then she had to conclude that she loved Ed more than he loved her . He would then be able to bear their parting more easily , more lightly than she would . If he loved her , why did he want to leave now , so shortly after they had become engaged , had begun to know and to enjoy each other ? The reasons he gave for leaving were not very forceful ones , particularly now when he was not present to urge them on her with all his persuasiveness . He knew people in Chicago . In New York , he was unknown . It should be easier for him to get ahead more rapidly in Chicago than in New York . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further . It would only cause her agony . She could see that the more she thought of his reasons , the weaker they seemed to be . She dreaded the conclusions that could be drawn from this observation . It was not a lack of love for her that was driving him to New York , she argued with herself . It was his spirit of adventure , his dear , dangerous , adventurous spirit . This was what was so wonderfulin him . This was why she loved him . And it was separatinghim from her . She did n't want to change him fundamentally . But could n't she check that adventurous spirit in him just enough to keep him with her ? If she could only sleep . She could dream of Ed . Perhaps she would have happy dreams . She would dream that he was not leaving her , but then she would wake up in the morning and realize that it had only been a dream . Even so , she wanted it , wanted such comfort for the short space of the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sank her face in the pillow . What should she do ? She recalled how she had been so bored when boys tried to force their attentions on her . She had only been contemptuous of such boys . She must do nothing that would cause Ed to feel this way about her . What should she do ? All is fair in love and war . But all is not good and wise , because some of the things you did might cause you to lose . And where was her pride ? What kind of a person was she that she had to let herself grow so dependent on another person  --  even on Ed ? But , oh , how silly , how ridiculous pride was when you were in love ! She wanted Ed so much . She wanted him to be with her in her bed at this very moment . She wanted to have him with her every minute of her life . And he was going away . She felt like crying . But she gritted her teeth , tautened her limbs , clenched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be weak . But , oh , God , how could she prevent Ed from leaving ? She heard the rumble of a streetcar passing on Sixty-seventh Street . Its echo faded . All was quiet . She was alone . The silence , the loneliness , of the night seemed sad , poignant . Ellen rose at dawn . She had slept badly during the night , but , yawning , she realized that she was not really tired . She was dull , half listless , but not actually sleepy . She dressed quietly and in haste . She wrote a note saying that she had gotten up at dawn to go out and take a walk in the park , so that her father need not worry if he discovered she was n't in bed . She did n't want him to worry . She left the note by the telephone and tiptoed out of the apartment . Ellen stepped out of her hallway into a scene half obscured by a thick gray mist . She stood in front of her building for a moment , breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Off in the eastern wing of the sky she saw low , fleecy clouds lightly veined with pink . Soon the sun would rise . It would be glorious . While she stood looking opposite her at the trees and shrubbery outlined in the fog , she heard the echo of footsteps about a block away . They were a light tapping on the pavement , but it sounded strange , mysterious . She heard it die away . The world was so quiet . She heard nothing , and she was absorbed in her own thoughts and feelings . She crossed the street , found a path through the dew-moistenedbushes , and then strolled over the wet grass of the golf course . The miracle of dawn was preparing for its unfoldment before her eyes . She could see the fog lighten ; white chunks of mist floated and faded away like clouds . While she had been finding her way into the park , the pink in the clouds had spread and deepened . A shadow swept across the dark grass like a frightened animal in flight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The departing mist was turning from gray to white and silver . During the time required for her to walk a few yards , the color in the sky had again been transformed , and the clouds were stained with red . How lovely , Ellen thought . Ellen felt so young , so gay , so like a child . Not knowing why she did it , she broke into a run . Giggling and breathless , she stopped as suddenly as she had started . She walked on , tracing a zigzag course , walking as she used to when she was a little girl . Her manner of walking brought back her childhood to her . She was under the spell of an illusion , the illusion that years of time had been washed away and that she was a flat-chested little girl in grammar school . Just as the mist was vanishing before her eyes , so did her illusion disintegrate in her mind . She was not a little girl , and she was melancholy . She wanted to reach backwardand restore the time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and her nostalgia faded . It was more fun to be with him than it would be to return to the past . Oh , what fun it would be to spend the night with him in love , to wake at dawn , spent , listless , satisfied , to rise and walk hand-in-hand with him toward the sunrise . Yes , if he were only with her , and they were now breathing in the fresh morning air , walking in the same wet grass , waiting together for the sun to burst upon the world . She missed him so much now . When they were married , this is what they would sometimes do . When she saw him today she would tell him of what she was now doing . He would understand her feeling and he would approve of this adventure . He was capable of doing the same thing himself . Ed had a soul . She and Ed had similar souls . They were made for each other , if ever man and woman were . In her absorption she had not heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others took up the notes , and a chorus of singingp195and chirping unexpectedly burst upon her . She listened as if she were hearing birds sing for the first time in her life . Though still hidden , the sun was burning through the fog , like an X ray . The world was growing lighter . The mist scattered . The sky was bright . The deep red which had stained it only a moment before was erased , and the sun hung over the eastern horizon , a rising ball of orange fire , gradually , subtly changing to gold and luminous yellow . It rose higher , a yellow disk , so brilliant that she could not focus her eyes upon it directly . It hung high in the sky , as if it were somewhere above the unseen blue of the invisible lake beyond Jackson Park . As the sun rose , the scene changed . Shadows swept the earth . Fields of grass turned into diffused and uncertain lagoons of color . Drops of dew were endowed with the glistening brilliance of diamonds . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anchored in the sky . A new dawn , like an act of creation , had burst upon the world . Awed , enthralled , Ellen had watched this spectacle . Every object , every color , each movement , the grass , the trees , the singing birds , the blue sky , had appeared as if imbued with a life which matched that which throbbed within her own body . She wanted to penetrate to the heart of this life , to possess it , all of it , until it was absorbed into her own nature . And , oh , she wished Ed were with her . She stood still and a strange sense of loneliness came upon her . The world borrowed from her her loneliness . It was a lonely world , one which only Ed could make friendly for her . Somehow he seemed related to , connected with , and involved in everything she had just seen . The sun was part of Ed , and Ed was part of it . The drops of dew on the grass , they were suggestiveof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motions , saturatedwith a life all its own , and Ed was part of it , and it was part of Ed . Everything she saw , everything she thought , everythingshe felt , she was doing for Ed as well as for herself . This was why she missed him so much . If he were only with her , they could talk of the dawn together . She would listen to him . He would describe the dawn for her . He would hold her ,  |p196kiss  her , and , holding hands , they would run over the wet grass like happy children , and they would laugh together . She was anxious for the time to arrive today when she would see him . Her Ed ! But he was going away , and she feared he would not come back to her . Ellen strolled on , heedless of her soggy feet . She thought that six months ago , if anyone had predicted that she would be doing precisely what she was now doing , she would have laughed scornfully . How unpredictable life was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog , separated from her by such space that they appeared small , strange , as if they were figures from a world different from that in which she walked . A cloud hid the sun , breaking , distorting , blunting its warm rays . Shadows of this cloud stole across the grass , taking away the sparkle of the blades of grass it touched , painting these blades a deeper , darker green . But then the cloud was gone , and the motion of another shadow was traced on the same grass . How charming ! How wonderful was life ! She began to sing a popular song which she knew was cheap . But it entwined its tune into the warp and woof of her emotions , and it moved her as she sang . When you and I were seventeen , and life and love were new . If Ed were with her , she would ask him to sing . He had such a rich voice . He was such a spirit , so poetic , so sensitive , so brave , so adventurous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of him that she loved this dawn , this world and everything in it . The man and dog in the distance had disappeared from sight . She was alone , and she strolled aimlessly on . Ellen quietly let herself in by the front door . " Ellen ! " her father called , his angry voice breaking into her mood . " Ellen , where are you ? " he called from the dining room.  |p197She  found him standing by the table in his shirtsleeves , his hair tousled . He looked worried . Saying nothing , she faced him , impassive . " What the hell 's gotten into you ? " " You got my note , did n't you , Father ? " " Yes , but what the hell 's the idea of scaring the life out of me , going out walking at this time of the morning ? Why , what would people think ? A decent girl should n't be out in the park at this hour of the morning . What would people think of her ? " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see the sun rise . " " You never did this before . . . before you met that fellow . I suppose you were meeting him . What kind of monkey business is this ? " " No , I was n't . And there 's no kind of monkey business . I wanted to get up and see the sun come up . It was so lovely . " " You did n't even comb your hair . You look like a fright . I do n't want my daughter carrying on this way . " " Carrying on ? What 's wrong with getting up early and goingout for a walk in the park ? Did n't you ever do it ? Did n't anybody ever do it ? " " Ellen , you 're acting queer and strange , not at all like yourselfever since you met this fellow . " " Do n't call him this fellow . He 's my future husband and your future son-in-law . " " Well , I do n't think he 's a good influence . " " Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by God ! " " But I own myself . You ca n't change my mind . And you 're making a mountain out of a molehill . All I did was to get up and take a walk in the park to see the sunrise , and because of that , you carry on like this . " " Me , carrying on ? " " Well , are n't you ? " " You look like a fright . " " Father , do n't be so old-fashioned . " He sputtered . He did n't know what to say . His anger van/ished , and he stood before her , a sad old man , his expression weak . She was touched . Although she was sympathetic to him , sorry for him , she believed she had to defeat him once and for all . " Father , I sha n't argue with you . I love Ed and I 'm going to marry him , " she said , speaking slowly , decisively . Mr. Rogers said nothing . His shoulders slumped . His fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left his body . " My feet are wet . I want to change my shoes and stockings , " she said . " Risking catching your death of cold in the park ! " Without answering him she went out of the room . He stood at the doorway through which she had just passed , his face blank . His jowls were slack . His eyes were dull , surrounded by little bags of fatty tissue . His thick lips were relaxed . He dropped into a chair and thoughtfully drank his cup of cold coffee.  |p199IEd  sat alone on a bench in the lockup of the Woodlawn police station . It was a large room with high barred windows on one side ; the other three sides consisted of iron bars . A toilet was in one corner , hidden by a door ; along the wall and on one other side were old benches . The lockup was well filled with males of varying ages , both black and white . They sat , alone or in groups , stood , moved idly about . Ed had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit by himself on a bench and observe . He decided that his companions in crime constituted a motley collection . He reflected for a moment , weighing the words motley and nondescript , and he concluded that motley was the more applicable one . There were Negroes arrested for an odd assortment of petty offenses , mostly robbing ice boxes ; there were two high-school students , from the near-by Catholic high school of Mary Our Mother , arrested for fighting . That was the school Danny O'Neill and Marty Mulligan had gone to , only then it had been named Saint Stanislaus . There were drunks , some sobering up , others floundering around in alcoholicstupor , pedlars caught selling odds and ends of junk withoutlicenses , a burglar trapped in an apartment , a poor sap of a fellow who was being jugged for non-payment of alimony , and some others . Yes , a motley collection of human animals , he reflected . Ed was hoping he would get out of this jug in a hurry . The short time he had already spent here in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that he did n't fancy it . The realization that he was being held forcibly , that he was enclosed by iron bars , that his movements , his privacy , were restricted , was irritating , aggravating ; it was just goddamned lousy gripe . But suppose he should n't get out in a hurry ? He enjoyed asking himself this question , especially because he was certain that his mother was on the way over to rescue him and that when she came and paid the bill he owed his landlady , he would be released . That fat slob of a landlady was n't interested in getting him jailed . Her concern was the rent for her cramped little room . Even if she did want to press charges against him , it would only be a first offense , and at that , just a matter of a five-dollar bill for rent . He was in no danger . Therefore it was particularly attractive and amusing to think of being sent up the road . He would be happier if he had a cigarette . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken care of . He smiled ironically , thinking that once in his life Lanson had n't been so smart . He 'd thought that he was getting away with something , sneaking out dirty underwear every night . And the beefy , stupid-faced slob , Mrs. Brinn , had n't been as dumb as she looked . Today when he was walking out she was waiting for him at the foot of the stairs , and who stepped out of the side room but a goddamned dick . Thus , here he was . So it was another episode , another little detail in his life . Some day he ought really to be able to write the true story of his life , and it should make quite a book . The two high-school students sat down beside Ed . " Hey , what do you think they 'll do to us ? " one of them asked . " Nothing . Do n't worry , bud , " he answered . " You sure ? " the boy persisted ; he was pimply faced , with light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to happen to us . That is , unless we get canned from school , " the other student said . " What was you picked up for ? " the pimply-faced student asked . " Safe cracking , " Ed said casually.  |p20IThey  looked at him , amazed . And then their amazement turned to speechless admiration . " Say , you 'll go to Joliet , wo n't you ? " the pimply-faced studentsaid . " I do n't know . I think my pals will spring me . If not , I 'll have a long stretch to do . This is the third time the bulls nabbed me . " A keeper stood by the bars near Ed , pointing at the students . " Come on , you two , " he said authoritatively . Timid , frightened , they rose and went to meet the cop at the gate of the lockup . Ed watched the kids go , amused . He thought of Ellen . He was late for a date with her . She did n't know what had happened to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him make one call , he 'd phoned Mother and he 'd asked her to get in touch with Ellen . Mother probably had been too ashamed to tell Ellen where he was , but she 'd probably called and given some other excuse . Well , that was the least of his worries right now . Cigarettes were a bigger one . He got up and decided to stroll about and see who would be most likely as a touch for a fag from among the inmates . He saw his mother standing by the gate with a cop . He walked over to where she stood . " Come on , " the cop said . The gate was opened , and Ed walked out of the lockup . His mother hugged and kissed him . " Why did you do it , Edmond ? " she asked in a troubled voice ; she was a dark woman in her forties , but with no gray hair . She was slight of build , with even features , a pleasing and intelligent face , and hazel eyes that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes . Standing beside Ed , the resemblance between mother and son was clearly discernible . He followed his mother and the keeper into the front of the station . The keeper motioned for Ed to go to the window where a red-faced , stout , gray-haired lieutenant sat.  | " Please , Edmond , do n't answer him back , " Mrs. Lanson whispered to her son ; she followed him to the window . " We did n't book you  --  this time . But you can thank your stars we did n't . If you 're brought back to us , fellow , you wo n't get off so easy . You ought to be ashamed of yourself . A lad like you with as fine a lady for a mother as you have , why do you do such things ? " Ed did n't answer . " Officer , he wo n't again , " Mrs. Lanson said . " Let me handle him , lady . I 'll put the fear of God in him for you , " the officer said . Ed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also swinging on this fat slob of a cop . " You ought to be ashamed of yourself , a big , strapping lad like yourself , playing dead beat instead of working . " How long would the slob go on ? Ed wondered . Just then two cops entered with a Negro . They shoved him across the room . One of the cops took a poke at the Negro . " Come on , " the other cop said , " come on get up to that window , you black . . . " He spied Mrs. Lanson and instead of swearing he shoved the Negro . " All right , Lanson , you 're released , " the lieutenant said . " Leave him alone . Because you 've arrested somebody , you have n't the right to punch hell out of him , " Ed said to the cop who 'd just punched the Negro . " Say , who are you ? " the cop asked . " Never mind who I am . You have no right to punch people around , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , I have n't . Suppose I punch you around ? " " You wo n't be able to  --  not if you take your star off and step outside with me . " " Edmond , please ! " Mrs. Lanson said . " I wo n't , huh ? I do n't have to step outside . I 'll take care of you inside . How do you like that ? " " Who is this guy ? " the cop 's companion asked . The lieutenant who had released Ed , and had been bookingp203the Negro , heard the angry argumentative voices . He got to his feet and waddled out of his partitioned cage . He glared at Ed . " What 's up now ? " the lieutenant asked . " He 's interferin ' , Lieutenant . He 's interferin ' with the law , and threatenin ' an officer . We ought to book him , " answered the cop with whom Ed had been having words . " Son , please come on with me , " Mrs. Lanson said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him just as he was going to retort to the cop . " You 're just one of those smart boys who do n't know when you 're well off , " the lieutenant said . " Officer , my son did n't do anything . He and I both saw this policeman , " Mrs. Lanson pointed . " We saw him brutally punch a prisoner . The law does n't give you police the right to beat people up . All my son did was protest , and this officer threatenedmy son . If anything happens , I 'll take his star number , and yours , too , and if you dare touch my son , you 'll pay for it . You have no right to break the law . " " Mother , I can take care of myself , " Ed said . " Say , lady , we been considerate of you , have n't we ? We did n't book your son ? What 's the matter ? Now , why do n't both of you leave the station ? " the lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Lanson said . The lieutenant turned to the cops . " Take the shine back to the lock-up . And do n't be punching him . " He turned back to Ed and Mrs. Lanson . " Now , good day . You 're released . Better leave the premises . " Without saying a word , Ed and his mother left the station . " Edmond , what 's the matter with you ? " Mrs. Lanson said as they walked away from the station along a narrow street toward Sixty-third . " Nothing , Mother . I 'm not going to stand by and let a brutal cop beat up a helpless , defenseless dinge just because the cop has arrested him and the cop has the alleged authority on his side . " " Edmond , you were perfectly justified in standing up for that poor colored boy . I was proud of you . It was noble . But ,  |p204Edmond  , why did you let yourself sink so low that you would be arrested as a dead beat ? When you have a decent home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I 'm sorry , Mother , I was proud . " " Your pride will lead you into trouble yet if you do n't disciplineit . " " Would you want me not proud ? " " Now , Edmond , Mother is on to your sophistries , " she said . He smiled at her . " Mother , did you telephone Ellen ? " " Yes , I did . I did n't tell her the truth , though . I said that you were doing an errand for me and would telephone as soon as you were free . She seemed to understand . Her voice is sweet . Edmond , for my sake , for your own , do n't let Ellen know what happened to you . " " Of course I wo n't . " " You better telephone her . But , Edmond , after what you 've gone through , your mother is taking you home tonight . " " I have to see Ellen . " " And then where are you going to sleep ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Of course , Mother . But let 's eat now . I 'm hungry . And Mother , have you some money to buy me cigarettes . I 'm dyingfor a smoke . " She dug into her pocketbook . Ed sat with his mother , eating lustily . It was the same restaurant at which he 'd had breakfast the morning when he had walked out of the Tudor Hotel . " Edmond , what 's the matter with you ? Why wo n't you settle down ? " " Mother , I 'm going to . " " Where have I heard that tune sung before ? " " You do n't believe me ? "  | " Of course I do . I always believe my son . Why , like George Washington , he never told a lie . " " Do n't rub it in . You know , Mother , that when there is anythingserious , I never lie to you . Maybe I tell you a white lie to spare you worry , but I never tell you a lie if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you going to settle down ? Have n't we had enough of your escapades ? " she asked . Ed thawed his mother out with a boyish smile . She returned it . " You 're using technique on your mother , " she said . " Oh , no , not on her . She 's too smart for me to get away with technique with her . " " Well , she understands her son better than anyone else does . " " Of course she does . Mother , what do you think of Ellen ? " " From talking to her I judged she must be a nice girl . She has a sweet voice . " " You must meet her . " " I invited her to come over and see us . " " But how did you know I 'd be there ? " " I assumed it . After this experience , I assumed you 'd rather have your mother as a landlady than someone else . One thing about me as your landlady  --  I sha n't call the police on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , we have so much room , it 's foolish of you not to stay home with us . And after all , we are your parents . We have some interest in the future of a bright but foolish son . " " Now , Mother , you know me . You know that some day I 'll settle down . " " But it 's high time that you did , Edmond . I 'm no goodygoody . I know a little about life  --  I 'd have to , after raising three sons such as mine ! " " Mother , would you really be pleased if I were a boy scout ? " " Indeed I would n't . But , Edmond , you ca n't go on doingwhat you did today . It 's unworthy of you . It demeans you . " " Mother , I live dangerously . " She laughed at him.  | " You do n't take me seriously , " he said . " Edmond , I have heard you sit at home and tell the darndest , the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But your mother is smarter than your girls . I do n't know about Ellen . But some of the others believed you more than your mother does when you say such things . Edmond , you 're too good to do such things as you did today and you know you are . " Mother , you do have faith in your son , do n't you ? " " Of course I do , but he does such terrible things to me . How do I feel , how do you think I feel , having to come to the police station and face that landlady , and those policemen , in order to get you out ? How do you think I feel ? It 's the same as when that other thing happened to you , that sickness . " " Mother , that 's over . And after all , you must know that I 'm only human , " he said , thinking that it was good that he had been cured of his dose . " I 'll not rake up the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you going on being foolish ? " " Mother , I 'm getting a job in New York . " " With whom ? " " Through John Devormer . He 's giving me a letter of introduction , and I 'll land a good connection . I see bigger game in New York than here . I 'm going there to settle down , and then I 'll send for Ellen as soon as I make my start . " She looked at him anxiously . " Edmond , if you really have a chance , you know I won'tstand in your way . But if this is another wild goose chase ... " " Mother , I need a fresh start , a change of scenery . " " Edmond , you 'll break my heart yet . " " Mother , how did Father take the news about me ? " " He was very hurt . He did n't say a word except to tell me that I 'd better straighten it out and bring you home . When will you be home ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Edmond , are you serious about going to New York ? "  | " Yes , Mother . But do n't worry . This time I 'm going to make good . " " You can make good in Chicago . " " I want to reach the real top of the pile . New York is the place for me . " " My son , do n't go on in life being your own worst enemy . " " This time I 'm not . This time , Mother , I 'm serious . I 'm goingto make good in New York , and in a hurry . " " Have you seen Mr. Devormer ? " " Yes , I 've talked to him . He believes it 's a good idea for me to go to New York and thinks that I 'll make good . " " Edmond , look me in the eye . Are you telling me the truth ? Look me in the eye . I can tell . " She fixed her gaze upon him . " Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , Mother . " " I believe you this time , Edmond , " she said , smiling at him tenderly . " Mother , if only Ellen , even Ellen , were as smart and as wonderfulas you are . " " I 'm not as wonderful as all that . But I do understand my strange son . " " Strange ? " " No , not really strange . Just seemingly so . Edmond , you are really just a wonderful little boy . " " You know , Mother , that you are idealizing . Every mother thinks that of her son . " " No , you are still a boy . I 'm not idealizing , either . I know you . " Ed smiled at her , blew her a kiss . He finished his meal , and they got up . She paid the bill . " Mother , " he said on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant . " Yes , Ed . " " I hate to ask you , but I need carfare . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Edmond , do n't be ashamed to ask me for money . I 'm your mother . " He frowned . She pulled out three single-dollar bills.  | " I do n't need that . " " Take it . You 're going to see Ellen . You ought to have something to buy her a sandwich or something . You 'll pay me back . " He accepted the money with seeming reluctance . He kissed his mother good-bye . She watched him stride off , her face sad . Ed stopped in front of the drugstore at Sixty-third and Stony Island . He took out his notebook and jotted down the five dollars his mother had paid for his rent and the three dollarsshe had just given him . One more debt . He went inside to telephone Ellen . He came out , smoking a cigarette , and he looked about to see if any of the boys he knew were around the corner . But none showed up , and he started walking towards Ellen's.  | " Oh , I 'm so glad you came . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . " I was forcibly detained from seeing you by nothing less than society itself , " Ed told her after kissing her . " What does that mean ? " " Oh , are n't my words clear enough ? I should say they are clear and precise . " She led him into the parlor . " Your mother telephoned me and said that you were on some errand for her . How is that being forcibly detained by society ? Oh , so your mother is society . You had to do something unpleasantbut necessary for your mother . " " No , that is not quite what happened . " " Then what did happen ? " " I 'll tell you . . . sometime . Perhaps the walls have ears here . " Ellen looked around the parlor . " Ed , tell me , did something happen . . . serious ? " she asked , lowering her voice . " I 'll tell you later , " he replied in a mysterious whisper . He picked up her hand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given her . " You do n't think that I would n't be wearing your ring ? " " I was sure that you would . I merely wanted to look at it , that 's all . " " I 'm dying to know what you did today , what happened to you . "  | " And I 'm in the same state about you . I would n't use the word dying . I would say I 'm keen to know , very keen . " " I just stayed home . " " You did n't go wandering about at dawn in the park like Lady Macbeth . " " Who ? " " Lady Macbeth . She was a friend of Will Shakespeare , and as a matter of fact , she was quite a bimbo , if I may lapse into the vulgar . " He thought for a moment , and then said , stressing his irony : " Come to think of it , I would n't want you to be like Lady Macbeth . " " I 'm so dumb . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember anything about it . " Mr. Rogers entered the parlor . " How do you do , Mr. Rogers , " Ed said , rising . " How do you do . How do you do , " Mr. Rogers replied . He sat down . " It 's nice weather we 're having , " Ed said , a twinkle in his eyes . " Oh , yes , pretty nice . Spring 's getting on . Before we know it , it 's going to be summer . " " Time flies , does n't it , " Ed said . " How are things going with you , Ed ? " " Did n't Ellen tell you ? That I 'm thinking of locating in New York ? I can do better there than I can here . " " No , Ellen did n't say a word about it to me . " " Well , she must have forgotten to mention it . " " When are you going to New York ? " " I have n't decided the exact date , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do you plan to stay there permanently ? " Mr. Rogers asked . " Yes , I do . " " It 's a risky step  --  to try and connect up in a strange town , especially New York . It 's expensive , too , supporting a family in New York . Have you taken that into consideration ? " Mr. Rogers asked  |p2II  " Oh , yes . But I expect to get on . I 'll send for Ellen when I am settled and have landed something good . " " Ca n't you manage something here ? Seems to me that Chicagois full of opportunities . " " Chicago is n't big enough for me . " " It 's big enough for a number of pretty big men , Ed . You know , youth is often cocky and confident . " " I 've weighed all the possibilities , I 've weighed and consideredthem carefully . I 'm not acting on the spur of the moment , but rather after careful consideration and forethought . " " What do you think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Ed and I are married , I 'll have to go where it 's best for Ed . " " I know . But it 's a question where it 's best . There are plenty of opportunities here in Chicago . And the people in Chicago are better people , homier people , simpler . And all your friends are here . It might be hard , and lonesome , too , in New York . As far as I 'm concerned , of course , I would n't consent to my daughter marrying and going to New York until you had made your mark there . You understand that , do n't you , Ed ? " " I share and appreciate your feeling and attitude perfectly , Mr. Rogers . I would n't think of asking Ellen to come to New York and make sacrifices . I value her too highly . That 's why I 'm setting out alone . " " I 'm glad to hear you say that . But I 'd think it over before I acted . I 'd think it over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sofa , crossed his legs . " Well , I have some work to do , leases and things to look over . Good night , " Mr. Rogers said , rising and leaving the room . " Your father is concerned about me . He does n't trust me , " Ed said . " Ed , tell me what happened this afternoon . " " Something trivial and sordid . " " But what ? " " Ellen , why do our parents find it necessary to lean on us asp2I2 if we were crutches ? It 's weakness  --  the weakness of parents . It 's the decrepitude of approaching old age . If the life of a parent has been bungled , or even if it is over , then the child must pay for that failure , justify it . That is what I mean when I say that parents want to use their children as crutches . But do parents honestly say this ? Not at all . No , instead of telling us the truth , they invoke universal morality . Because God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would saddle us with duties . And then , to add insult to injury , they , father or mother , say that they are only interested in the good and the future happiness of their children . Ah , it makes me want to puke . " " Ed , I do n't like that word . " " And I do n't like the experience it connotes . But sometimes it is an inevitable , unpreventable , a necessary experience . It is necessary to health and , shall I say , duodenal comfort . And it 's a figure of speech , telling us something of psychology . Psychologically , we have to puke up our past , retch up our love for our father and mother , if we would be free and strong , independent , going our own road in our own way . This is what we need to do if we would be men and women instead of emotionaland psychological crutches for those who have already lived their lives , had their little day , walked to the end of their own particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on like this when I want to know what happened to you today ? " " What happened to me is unimportant . What I am saying is important . " " You 're afraid to tell me . " " Now , how did you guess that so correctly , " he asked her , smiling in a genially sardonic manner . " You do n't care about me . You were with some other girl . " " There was another female involved in it , " he said . " And you did n't even call me up . I suppose I 'll get a verse ofpoetry from you in the mail in the morning . " " No , no verses . " " That will be kind of you . "  |p213Ed  watched her , his eyes twinkling . " Who was she ? You might as well tell me her name . " " It was a he . A fairy tried to make me . " " Disgusting ! How disgusting ! " " Now , that will teach you not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about today . " " Ed , why do you play with me ? When I 'm anxious you beat around the bush . " " Ellen , are you losing your sense of playfulness ? " " No , I 'm not . Not at all . Only I worry about you . " " Today my landlady called the cops , and I was arrested fornot paying my room rent . " " How terrible ! Why did n't you call me ? " " I was only allowed one call . I did n't want to subject you to humiliation . I called Mother . I told Mother to tell you where I was , but she was ashamed to . Poor Mother . Anyway , I 'm out . " " Are you still in trouble ? " " No . Mother paid the bill . I was let go . They did n't book me . " " Tell me about it , Ed . " " Ed , how long will it take you to get settled in New York ? " Ellen asked as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was clinging to his arm . " Not long . " " But how long do you plan on ? " " Plan ? Why should Lanson plan ? " " So that I 'll know . " " The answer is simple . Not long . Not very long . Less time than you imagine . " " That 's still not definite , " she said . " I ca n't be definite and give specific periods . I do n't know . I only am sure of this . I 'll be on my feet very soon , and when I am , I 'll send for you . Ellen , you talk as if only you will suffer from this separation , as if it will mean nothing to me . Well , do n't think that I sha n't be missing you . I 'll be alone . At firstp214I 'll be alone in a dreary little room . I 'll come home alone at night and find no Ellen . My only communication with her will be by mail . No , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what I ca n't get out of my mind is this : Why must we tear ourselves away from one another now ? Is n't it foolish ? Could n't you first locate here , make good in Chicago , and then go to New York ? " " Ellen , it 's my nature always to do things the hard way . " " But why ? " " I must live dangerously , and , to use a figure , on a volcano . Nothing is gained the easy way . " " If you feel that way , ca n't you make it hard for yourself in Chicago ? " " I need to be lonely . If I am , I will be spurred on to greater efforts . I need to walk streets alone in a strange town , not even knowing one soul . " " But will that happen ? You 'll get to know people in a hurry , wherever you are . " " That 's not my aim nor my purpose on this trip . I plan to live like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of soli-tude . " " Ed , maybe you think this is necessary , but , honestly , I do n't see or understand why it is . " " You must take my word for it that it is . " She would take his word on almost everything . But still , she could not grasp why this proposed move of his was necessary . Suddenly she became frightened . Was it a kind of fate that was driving him on to do this ? Was it an evil fate ? Could n't she save him , if this were what it was ? But no , it was silly to think about some evil fate . No such thing existed in the world . They turned the corner at Sixty-third Street and Stony IslandAvenue . Ed nodded to the group of fellows standing at the corner , and they returned the greeting , some of them tipping their hats . They strolled on down Sixty-third Street . " Ellen , I have to conquer myself . That is the only way I can achieve self-conquest. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way in anything . If it is necessary , I 'll understand . " But why was it necessary ? How could she show him that it was n't necessary ? " I looked forward to the summer so much , the things we 'd do this summer , " she said . " So did I , " he said regretfully . " But there will be other summers , other days . " He smiled . " There will be better times , pal . " Would there ? Was she letting Ed slip through her fingers ? Was she losing him , losing him without even putting up a fight ? " I want to go with you . Ed , darling , I do . I wo n't be able to stand it without you . Why ca n't we make this struggle to-gether ? " " Sweet , I ca n't . I am tempted . " He waited for an instant . " I am tempted , but no , I ca n't . How can I conquer myself , as I must , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are going to New York principally to make good and earn the means of our getting married , so that we can be independent  --  is n't , that so , Ed ? " " That 's correct . That is the major reason for my trip . But the other reason is . . . spiritual . I 'm going to New York to be alone , to conquer myself , to harden my soul . " " Oh , Ed , why harden yourself ? You 're hard enough . You do n't need to do that . " " But I do . And out of this loneliness , as a result of my isolation , I 'll write my book . " Everything came before her . All this talk . " Ed , you talk almost as if you thought I was bad for you . " " No , not at all . No , I do n't at all imply that . Sweet , I have to go through this to earn you . " " Oh , Ed , that 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . I must act as I plan . Sweet , I must always be able to look myself in the face , and not be weak , not flinch , not say that I am ashamed of myself . " His explanations were getting much too complicated for her . All she knew was that she wanted him . He was her man , andp216she wanted him , but he was going into all this talk in order to explain why he had to go away , why he had to leave her . She stared glumly ahead . " Ed , ca n't we have something to drink ? " " Let 's . . . . But I do n't have much cash on me . " She looked into her pocketbook and pulled out a ten-dollar bill which she gave him . He took it indifferently . They sat at a table at The Palm Tree Inn . It was only half filled . " Ed , I 'm not a good girl , " she said , and they both laughed . " Oh , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm not . Not good . Not a good girl . A good girl , she does n't drink , does n't . . . " " You 're better than a good girl . " " What 's that ? " " You 're a superior girl . " " You just say that to flatter me . " " No , I do n't . " The orchestra began playing . They stood up to dance . " Superior ? No . But I 'm hard . You do n't think I 'm hard , do you , Ed ? You think I 'm soft , pliant . Well , I 'm hard . Oh , yes I am . Hard . If you knew what I did to men , what I could do to them . " " Tell me . " " No , I wo n't . " " Why ? " " Secrets of the trade . " " What trade ? " " Woman 's trade . " They shimmied . " I do n't want to go home tonight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 'm hard . " " Are you , Sweet ? " " Do n't you want me to be hard ? "  | " No , I want you to be soft . " " Then I 'm soft . . . and I 'm hard , too . " " What have you done that 's hard ? " " Wound fellows around my fingers like a piece of string . " " And then what did you do ? " " Unwound them , threw the string away . " " Is that a threat ? " " Darling , no . . . no . . . no . . . no . . . no . " " You promise never to wind me around your fingers like a piece of string ? " he asked . " Promise . " " That 's kind of you . " " Kiss me . " Ed kissed her . The orchestra stopped . They stood at the edge of the floor , waiting for the music to be resumed . Ed clapped noisily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is he the old flame you told me about ? " Ed asked . " Yes , that 's him , " she said , pronouncing her last word with contempt . " I do n't like his looks , " Ed said . " Neither do I , Ed darling , " she said , pulling Ed toward Bill . Surprised to see her , Bill drew back a pace . " Hello , " Ellen said . " Hello , " Bill said coldly . " Bill Northrup , this is Edmond Lanson , " Ellen said . " Pleased to meet you , " Ed said coldly , measuring Bill . Bill bowed . He was with a dark , pretty girl , and he didn'tintroduce her to them . " My , you 're not friendly , " Ellen said . " You seem rather distant toward us , " Ed said . " I 'm minding my own business . Ellen , I have to go . Excuse m e . " Bill , you 've been telling lies around town about me . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a liar . " " I say that . " " You call her a liar ? " Ed asked  | " I do n't know that this concerns you , " Bill said to Ed . " It does n't ? " " Lie about you ? I would n't even talk about a person like you , " Bill said to Ellen , sneering . " Take that back , " Ed ordered him . " This is n't any of your business , " Bill said . Ed crowded on him , punching with his left . Ellen , in her state of mild intoxication , had enjoyed the exchange of words . The excitement , the sudden flare-up of the fight , sobered her . " Ed , stop ! " she called loudly . The girl with Bill screamed . Bill tried to defend himself , helplessly . As people rushed around them and Chinese waiters scurriedto the scene of action , Bill went down , his nose bleeding . " Get up , you yellow louse ! " Ed said , standing over him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a big , burly dull-faced fellow yelled at Ed . " Who solicited your opinion ? " Ed asked , turning toward the fellow . " I do n't like your looks , " the big fellow answered . " Put ' ern up , " Ed said , advancing a step . " Ed , Ed , let 's go , " Ellen called . The big fellow rushed Ed . Ed checked him with a left jab . The big fellow rushed again , and , taking another jab , got in close and shoved Ed back . Then he tried to knee Ed , but Ed swerved a little to the side and raised his left leg , successfully protecting his groin . Ed pummelled the big fellow in the stomach with both hands and , getting an opening , shot his left to the big fellow 's jaw . The Palm Tree Inn was in a state of bedlam . Girls were screaming . Some guests watched the fight . Others threw food at the spectators and fighters . The Chinese waiters struggled to break up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they separatedEd and the big fellow . " Ed , are you all right ? " Ellen called . She went to his side . He smiled at her . She was pale , but seeing that he was unmarked and showed no signs of injury , she was consoled.  |p219Several  men stood between Ed and the big fellow . Heedless of them , Ed kept his eyes on the big fellow . In back of him , Ed saw Bill Northrup , bewildered , his nose still bleeding . " You had enough ? " Ed asked the big fellow . " No , punk . " " Come on down in the alley behind this place , " Ed said . " All right . " Ed walked to his table , followed by a group . " Ed , darling , please do n't fight , " Ellen pleaded . Ed picked up the bill and paid it . " Ed , wo n't you listen to me ? " " I 'm all right . You wait here and I 'll be right back . " " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . I ca n't stand it , " she said hysterically . " I 'll be back quickly . You wait here . " " What , are you yellow ? Hiding behind your skirt ? " the big fellow asked , coming to Ed 's table . " You 'll see who 's yellow , " Ed said , walking toward the exit . A crowd followed him . Ellen tried to catch up with him , butshe could n't until they were downstairs on the sidewalk . " Ed , wo n't you  --  for me ? Ed , please do n't fight him . " " Ellen , you stay here , and I 'll be right back , " he told her . " Come on , you ! " the big fellow said , sneering . Ed kissed Ellen . He turned and walked back to the alley with the big fellow . Ellen ran after him . Ed took off his coat and rolled up his sleeve . A ring of shouting persons formed around him and the big fellow . " Come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice very calm . " If you try any more dirty tricks , if you try to give me the knee again , I 'm going to cut that face of yours to ribbons with my left . One more dirty trick in this fight and your mother wo n't ever recognize your face again . " The big fellow suddenly smiled conciliatingly , stepping back to be sure he was out of the range of Ed 's fists . " Listen , boy , this is all a misunderstanding . If you insist on fighting , I 'll fight you . But this is a misunderstanding . "  |p220Ellen  stepped forward from the crowd and stood at Ed 's side . " How is it a misunderstanding ? " " Ed , shake hands and forget it , " she said . Ed did n't answer her . Ed and the big fellow walked off a few paces . Ellen followed . " That bozo you pasted . He is n't a friend of mine . I do n't see why you and me should fight over him . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow pulled out a bottle of gin . He and Ed drank . " Ed , darling , give me a sip , " Ellen said . Ed handed Ellen the bottle . She sipped it and made a face . " Let 's go some place else , " he said to Ellen . " Mind if me and my girl join you ? Our treat , " the big fellowsaid . " Not at all . But what 's your name ? Mine 's Jones , and this is Miss Smith , " Ed said . Ellen was dumbfounded , but she said nothing . " Mine 's O'Toole . Duffy O'Toole . " They shook hands . They sat in a booth at the Dive Inn with O'Toole and his girl , a plump , bleached blonde . The Dive Inn was a notorious tavern on South Chicago Avenue . It was crowded , and noisy drunks kept staggering past their booth . " Jones and Smith , now , who would have thought that Iwould meet people like you two ? " Duffy O'Toole said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Ed said , smiling cordially . Ellen picked her glass up to drink . Ed kicked her under thetable . She set down her glass . Just then the orchestra broke intoraucous jazz . " Excuse us , " Ed said , standing up . " Sure thing , pal , " O'Toole said . Ed led Ellen to the jammed dance floor . " Sweet , do n't drink any more , " Ed said on the dance floor . " Why ? "  |p22I  " Because I say so . " " Ed , do n't go way and leave me . " They were shoved into a corner in the jam of dancers . Ellen clung to him . " Why ? " Ed asked . " Because I say so , " she said . " Ellen , listen to me . I do n't like to be challenged . " " Well , I do n't either , " she said . " Listen to me ! You 're with strangers . You do n't know them . That 's why I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big fool , but he 's a bootlegger , too . I do n't want him to know who you are . And I do n't think either of us should get drunk with them . Pretend you 're a little drunk . And do n't go fighting with me . I 'm taking care of you because I love you , Sweet . " " I 'm not drunk . " They were shoved again by dancers . " You will be if you drink more of his hooch . It 's potent . ' " Just one more . " " No more . " " And if I do have one more ? " she asked . " I 'll leave . I 'll walk out of the joint . " She crushed herself against him . " I love you , darling , " she said , blowing an alcoholic breath in his face . He clutched her firmly to him . " Come on , stay a while longer , " O'Toole said drunkenly . " I 'm sorry , but we have to go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're friends . Bes ' friends in the world . Be ? friends . " " Shake on that , " Ed said , standing up and shaking O'Toole 's hand firmly . " Here 's my card . My card . Name , address , telephone number , " O'Toole said , relaxing his grip on Ed 's hand and giving Ed a card.  | " I 'll get in touch with you , " Ed said . He and Ellen said good night and left . " What an unusual night it 's been , " she said outside . " Hang around with me and something will always happen , " Ed said . They stood in front of the Dive Inn . It was a low , sprawling structure . They heard the loud music of the orchestra . " I 'm sober now . And it 's good to get some air after that stifling crowd inside , " she said . " Only for me , you would n't be sober . " " You do n't approve of me drunk . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you tell me you want me to be a free spirit , but if I get a little drunk you disapprove , do n't you ? " " No , not at all . I do n't disapprove morally . But after all , I do n't like the sight of a woman too drunk . And we were with strangers . I did n't trust them . " " But then , Ed , why did you go with him ? " " Because I did n't want him to think I was afraid to . " " You 're funny , but I love you so , " she said . He hailed a taxi cab . They got in it . Ellen flung herself in his arms . He kissed and petted her . Ed called to the driver . " Take it easy and drive us through Jackson Park , " he ordered.  |p223Out  of a sense of duty , Ed was staying home to have supper with his parents . He had promised his mother that he would , and she was in the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating . He sat alone in his room , smoking a cigarette . He had just finished writing letters to his two brothers and his sister , and he did n't feel like reading . He had come back home to live until he left for New York . Living at home had its advantages as well as its disadvantages . It pleased his mother and father , especially now that the other children were all out of town . It meant that no fat landlady would be running for the cops in order to collect the week 's rent from the star boarder . But his folks now lived on the near North Side instead of around FiftyeighthStreet . He would have to take long trips every day to see Ellen . Withal , that was not such a hardship . He could read en route . He had not failed to observe how his mother had cleaned the room for him , and how she had placed a photograph of him as a boy on the dresser . He had been in the eighth grade at Crucifixionwhen it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To her he remained a boy , although she was too clever , too understanding , really to treat him as a child . It was depressing to return home . Father was in a new businessagain , promoting an invention . His folks were just getting along . They had raised their family , and what had happened ? The children were all high-spirited , filled with wanderlust , alwayscoming and going , getting into scrapes , violating one or another rule of his father 's Victorian code . And after all these years Father was still struggling to make a living , meeting with the same old ups and downs , going from one business to another . Some day he would do something big for them . But such a life was fundamentally stupid . He thought about his father . The gaffer was a curious cuss . He was aloof , formal , dignified . When Arlette , his sister , had run off from a convent at seventeen and married a Jewish advertisingman , his father had not said a word . In his presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was his typical reaction . It was almost as if his father practiced a form of magic , believing that if unpleasant or disturbing incidents or actions of his children were not mentioned , they therefore had never happened . When Pierre , during the war , had run away from school and joined the navy , again his father had said nothing . He had suffered in silence , always maintaining his dignified demeanor , never allowing himself to appear ruffled . At times this trait of his father 's was admirable . At times it was comic . When he and Pierre would fight at home , and his mother , in order to end the fight , would faint , his father , while efficiently and tenderly taking care of his mother , would not unbend once , not allow his worry or strain to be observable . Yes , his gaffer was curious . But underneath the surface his father was kind , loveable . Yes , he respected his father , even though he-could n't get along with him . After all , Ed Lanson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pierre and Arlette were , too , and his younger brother , Bob , sometimes showed the same spirit . But it was gloomy to come back home with the folks . If Bob were home , it would be more pleasant . But every one must go his own way . It was cruel to grow old , and those who grew old had to face the music . His mother and father were doing it gracefully . His father was superior to the fathers of most chaps he knew . Think of him and contrast him with Ellen 's fat dumb slob of a father . He hoped that he would n't get into an argument with hisp225father this evening . For Mother 's sake he was going to be on his best behavior . He went to his desk in the corner and looked at the letter he 'd written to his older brother , addressed to Calcutta . He wanted to travel around the world , too . He would . He would accomplish every aim in life , realize every dream , actualize every wish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hello , Edmond , " Mr. Lanson said as Ed sat down to eat . Mr. Lanson was tall , swarthy , good-looking , with gentle eyes ; Ed resembled him physically in a rather vague way . Just as Ed had expected , the gaffer said not a word about yesterday 's arrest . " How are you , Edmond ? " " I 'm well , Father , how are you ? " " Oh , satisfactory . " " How is business ? Are you making any progress launching that invention ? " " Yes , I think it will go . It 's promising , very promising . " Mrs. Lanson sat down after bringing in the food . " Mother , it was sweet of you to make a cheese souffle . " " We had n't had one of late . Your father likes cheese souffle as much as you do , Edmond , " she said , serving them . " Your mother tells me that you are going to bring the girl to whom you are engaged over to see us , Edmond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Fine . Your mother and I should be pleased to know her . " " I 'm sure that you 'll both like Ellen . " He took a plate from his mother . " Thank you , Mother . " " She sounds like a very sweet girl on the telephone , " Mrs. Lanson said . " Of course , Edmond , marriage is a very serious undertaking . Marriage is something sacred , " Mr. Lanson said . " Father , I think Edmond realizes that , " his mother said . Ed listened with amused tolerance . He knew that a lecture was coming . Yesterday 's escapade was probably the cause , and this was the gaffer 's way of registering disapproval . " Coming home this afternoon , I was thinking about some general matters . Perhaps they would interest you , Edmond , " Mr. Lanson said . Ed restrained himself from smiling . His father 's little tricks , habits , mannerisms , were so amusingly transparent . " Of course , I 'd be interested to hear of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the simplest virtues are , because of their simplicity , the ones least recognized and heeded . There is no novelty in them , and this is an age when novelties are appreciated . We want everything new in this day and age . We do n't want to be attached to the old moorings . Our books and our lives reflect such sentiments . We are always moving , alwayswanting a new house , a new automobile , a new gadget , a new book . There was a time when we wanted things to be mellowed before we prized them . " Ed reflected that this was a real Babbitt-like speech . He realized how profound was the cleavage in outlook between himself and his father . Yes , two worlds sat at this supper table , looking at each other across a chasm , talking at cross purposes . Mother could partly bridge these worlds . That was her way of keeping peace when they were all home together . " Yes , it occurred to me , we no longer place the same significanceon words like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age . The old concepts , the old virtues , seem too homely for this day . One gets the feeling sometimes that no one had ever lived before this present century . Sometimes we act as if we were the first generation instead of the heirs of centuries of human wisdom . We are heedless of the truths these centuries teach us , these same simple virtues and mellow maxims about honesty , prudence , foresight , respect for authority . The more I think of these matters , the more I realize their importance . The notion that the new is so superior to the old is the product of the confidenceof inexperience . Perhaps because the Bible is true in telling us that there is nothing new under the sun , perhaps be/cause of this , many people today are so eager to find destructive novelty . " So this was the gaffer 's way of telling him off . Ed was moved . There was something poignant about his father 's speech , formulatedin generalities when its entire meaning was direct , specific . However , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would lead his father to think that he was surrendering , retreating , forced to act like the prodigal son . He was no prodigal son . " Father , merely because something is old , that does not make it good . " Mr. Lanson reflected for a moment before answering . " The reverse of what you say , Edmond , is also not true . So what does it mean ? It means that we must practice discrimination . Discrimination is nothing more nor less than the golden mean . In some instances something new is better than somethingold . For instance , machinery . New machinery is better than old machinery . A new automobile runs more smoothly than an old automobile . " Listening to his father , Ed was amazed that it had taken him so long to make a relatively simple observation . In some ways he and the gaffer were alike . Making allowance for the difference in their ages , the difference in their attitudes and values , they both had the same inclinations . They liked to talk , to philosophize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to lack vanity in every way . And what had happened : just as when you repressed sex it came out in other ways , on a soapbox and so on , it also happened that when you suppressed the ego , it came out in other ways . This was his father 's ego gratification , his father 's expression of the will-to-power . " Of course , I did not have machinery in mind . What I had in mind is what we called wisdom . Wisdom by its very nature is not novel , new . It is tried , tested by centuries of experience . Wisdom is not concerned with choosing between a new automobileand an old automobile . It is concerned with testing new values before it substitutes them for old values . That is why wisdom is mellow , why I was remarking a moment ago that inp228an age like this one we no longer place the same value on words like mellow that we used to . " " Values and ideas become as worn out , as rusty , Father , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to transvalue all values , " Ed said . " Oh , let 's not have any long discussions tonight . Let 's just talk . Here , J. P. , pass me your plate and I 'll give you the rest of this souffle , " Mrs. Lanson said . Mr. Lanson handed her his plate . " That 's what I was doing , explaining to you and Edmond some reflections that came to my mind as I was riding home . I have to write to Pierre and Robert , and I was thinking of what I was going to write . " " When will my family be home with me again ? " Mrs. Lansonasked . Ed felt that this remark of his mother 's was not merely a spontaneous outcry . It was a calculated remark which she hoped would touch him , impel him not to leave Chicago . His mother was clever . " Edmond , what are your plans ? " Mr. Lanson asked , taking his plate from his wife . " Your mother told me you intend to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think that I can locate there and do better than here . " " I hope that this is n't a wild goose chase . " " No , Father , it is n't . I think that there are more prospects in advertising in New York than here . I 've had enough experience now to make the right kind of a connection . " Mrs. Lanson focused gently satiric eyes on her son . " Mother , you seem skeptical ? " he said , not missing her glance . " Why do you say that , Edmond ? " " The way you were looking at me . " " I was n't saying a word , Edmond . " " I know it . But you were looking them . " " Not at all . I did , of course , remember that I 've heard the same story before . Pierre ca n't locate in Chicago , and so he'sp229now on a ship bound for India . Robert is in Wisconsin . You had to go South once . Now , it 's New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole world for my children . " " The only cure for restlessness is discipline , " Mr. Lanson said . Mrs. Lanson brought in coffee and a chocolate cake she had baked . " Mother , what a tasty-looking cake . Did you bake that ? " Ed asked . " Yes , instead of deciding this afternoon that it would be best for me if I located in Kobe , Japan , or Bombay , India , where I could go my own road in my own way , I baked a cake , " she said . " You 're being ironic , Mother , and after baking such a temptingmorsel as that cake . " She laughed and , cutting large slices of cake , passed them to her son and husband . She poured coffee for them and passed the cups . " Are you going to be home this evening , Edmond ? " " I have to see Ellen . " " Well , some evening , now that the prodigal has temporarily returned , you might remain home long enough to renew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tonight , though , I must see Ellen . " " Your father likes a game of checkers now and then . " " I 'll stay home tomorrow night if I can . " " I want to continue our discussion , Edmond , " Mr. Lanson said . " I have to go now . As it is , I 'll be late for my date . " He rose . His mother followed him down the hall to his bedroom . " I pinched this from your father 's pocket , " she said , handing him a dollar . " J.P . does n't ever miss a dollar . But now , you be good and come home early . I 'll be worried if you 're out too late . " " Mother , you 're wonderful . You 're adorable . You 're .. Mother , " he said , kissing her.  | " Yes , I know . And now I 'll have to worry about another son away from home , too . And your father is upset , but he does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do is to worry about me . I 'm alwaysable to take care of myself under all circumstances . " " So I learned yesterday . Edmond , I wish you were as able to take care of yourself as well as Pierre . He manages to take care of himself better than you do . " He frowned . " I 'm not a child , " he said . " Now you stop being surly . Ellen wo n't like it . " " I have to go , " he said , feigning good nature . Some day he would make her take back what she said of him and Pierre . But that was a matter for the future . He kissed her again . Smiling although she was very sad , she watched him leave , and then went back to sit with her husband.  |p231Ellen  paid no attention to her father at the table . Her mind was filled with the events of last night . It had been so exciting , the fight , Dive Inn , and then the taxicab ride she and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were out late last night , " Mr. Rogers said . " What did you say , Father ? " " Yes , it was very late when you came in . " " It was n't so late . And there is n't anything wrong with beingout a little late once in a while . After all , I 'm going to marry Ed . " " It does n't look decent to see a girl coming home at all hours of the morning . And it is n't good for your health , either . " Ellen knew that he was n't bothered about her being out late . She had been out late before and he 'd never reprimanded her . It was because she had been with Ed . " When you are engaged to a young man , you must show restraint and dignity . A young man is n't going to think too much of a girl if she lets him keep her out until the small hours of the morning . " The philosophy of love and marriage was now being expounded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to stay out . Maybe I kept Ed out , " she said . Mr. Rogers was taken aback by her remark . He said nothing . She thought that her father should just know the whole story of last night , the fight , the people she had been with , the taxi/cab ride . And he should know that Ed had been arrested yesterdaybecause he was n't able to pay his landlady . " Ellen , that is n't the way to conduct yourself . Even if you are engaged to Ed , you must maintain your dignity , your bearing , your control . You must act so that you are sure you will keep his respect . You ca n't do that if you keep urging him to stay out late , to keep you out that way . " " Why is it so wrong to be out late ? " " It is . " " Why ? " ? " It is n't right for a decent young girl of your age to be out until half past three and four in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't well . Aunt Alice had planned to come to Chicago just to meet Ed and pass judgment on her engagement . She even suspected that her father had written , asking Aunt Alice to come . But sometimes operations served their purpose , even if she did n't wish her aunt any unnecessarytrouble . She did n't mean to entertain such cynical thoughts . And they would n't even occur to her if her father and aunt showed any intelligence and imagination about life . " Ellen , do you get these new ideas of yours from him ? " " What new ideas ? " " Telling me that it 's proper if you stay out as late as you please ? " " But you have n't told me what 's wrong with my being out late once in a while . " " Decent people are in bed at that time . " " Then I 'm not decent , is that what you mean ? " He stared at her , first in surprise , then with uneasiness . " I do n't at all like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Father , you are worrying yourself unnecessarily . You know I would n't ever do anything to cause you trouble . Have n't I always told you everything I do ? " " Yes  --  so far as I know . " " Then you do doubt me , and that is why you ask me questions and are talking to me the way you are tonight . "  |p233Ed  should hear her now . He would approve of the way she was playing her cards and handling her father . " Father , did n't I come home and tell you that I was engaged ? Could n't I have run off and gotten married secretly if I wanted to ? But I did n't . Still you do n't trust me . " " Did he want you to do that ? " Mr. Rogers asked in mountinganxiety . " No , he did n't . All I  --  " " Where did you get that idea ? " he asked , interrupting her . " Anybody could get such an idea . All I meant was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , then I could . But I do n't want to . I would n't . I want to make you understand that you have no reason to distrust me . And I always wanted you to feel you trust me . After we are married , I will feel the same toward you as I do now . " He looked at her guiltily . She was moved . She was sorry for him . He was sad , pathetic . She did n't want to deceive him , but what else could she do ? If she told him the truth , he would be more hurt . She was selfish in acting the way she did . But she had to be selfish . It was her life . She had to live it . And her father was selfish . She could clearly understand what was behind his dislike of Ed . He wanted her home . Her father pretended that it was for her own good that he advised her . But it was really for his good . She had to lie to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God  --  did Ed lie to her too ? " Ellen , there is no question about my trusting you . I do . You are a crackerjack of a girl . What I want to make sure about is that Ed is good enough for you . " No , Ed did n't lie to her . He loved her . He would n't lie to her , and he did n't have to . There was no need for their lying to each other . " Father , I 'm going to be happy with Ed , " she said in answer to his last statement . " I hope so . " He added , as if it were an afterthought : " When is he going to New York ? " " He 's making his plans . "  | " Seems to me it 's a wild goose chase . If a person ca n't make good in one place , it is n't likely he will in another . " " Ed can make good in any place . " " Well , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He thinks he has a better chance there . " " Do you want him to go ? " " No , I do n't , " Ellen found herself saying before she realized it . " So he 's going against your wishes ? " " Not exactly that . " Mr. Rogers did n't pursue the question further . His face becamethat of a man relieved of a pressing worry . Ellen did not fail to observe this change . She guessed that she should resent it , but somehow she did n't . It was n't really important to her what her father thought.  |p235There  was a jarring clatter of dishes and noise in the Raklios Restaurant on Randolph near State Street . Ed sat in a corner with a cup of coffee before him , looking out of the window , idly watching the flow of pedestrians on the sidewalk . He would be disturbed and annoyed by the noise here if it were not for the fact that he was sitting pretty and proud of his finesse . Finesse was the exact word . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just right . O'Toole had been prepared like a lamb for the slaughter . He could now turn this trick neatly . His guess was that the precise amount to get was fifty bucks . He would like to raise the ante , but he was inclined to believe that if he did , he 'd scare his chump away . It was better to settle for fifty rather than scare the bird out of the bushes . He inhaled , lifted his head , and in utter contentment let the smoke escape through his nose . He whistled a phrase of music . He reflected on how the human animal was a source of endless surprise , of ever-recurring amazement . They were fooled so easily . They were so credulous , born to be such suckers . Talk to them in the appropriate setting , with seeming conviction , and it was usually a foregone conclusion that they would believe you . Men were such fools . They were motivated not only by the will-to-power ; many of them were more strongly motivatedby the will-to-believe . The folly of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this reflection . But if this were so , what should he say of the folly of women ? The sight of Duffy O'Toole coming through the swinging 235p236doors of the restaurant interrupted his meditations . He got up and waited for O'Toole , who approached him smiling genially . " How 's tricks , Jones ? " " Oh , just so-so . I lined up a new job and I 'm going to be able to make more money than I 've ever earned . " " Glad to hear it . " " Everything looks rosy . " " You 're looking at the world through rose-colored glasses , huh ? " " Yes , everything 's jake , " Ed said . " I 'm damned glad to hear it , Jack . " Duffy went to the counter and returned with coffee and a hamburger sandwich . Finishing his coffee , Ed lit another cigarette . " Well , I ai n't got no complaints myself . People buy the gin I sell , and that just sets me to feeling the way I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it ? " " I buy the alcohol from a friend of mine . He runs a drugstore . I mix it myself and sell it . You know , I just sell it to people I know . I go to a couple of different places where there is a gay young crowd , and I get to know them . So I make a good living that way , much better and much easier than I used to make helping on a truck for the Continental Express Com-pany . " " I 'd say you would . " Duffy took out a bank book and waved it in front of Ed . " I never had this when I was helpin ' on an express truck . No sir , I did n't . " " That 's a card . " " It 's more than a card . It 's a good time . " " What 's the use of living if you do n't have a good time , is n't that so , Duffy ? " " You said it , Jack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city . Right now , while you and I are sitting here , they 're working their pants off . " " Saps. "  | " Yes , that 's just the word . The world is full of saps . Duffy , I 'm glad I met you . We see things the same way . " " Sure thing . It was a mistake , our fighting . But if we did n't tangle that way , why then we would n't have met each other . Say , how 's the bim ? " " Oh , she 's all right . " " Neat little trick , she is . " " Yes , she 's keen . " " And wild , too , " Duffy said , leering . Ed did n't answer . He studied O'Toole 's stupid , ruddy face . How he would like to take a punch at it ! Gross , prejudiced , dumb . Well , all the better for him . Duffy was talking about the world being full of saps . Should he spring it yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What else is new , Duffy ? " " Nothing much . Like I said , things go along , nice and smooth for me . I 'm gettin ' along . " " That 's because you 're smart . " " Well , I ai n't dumb . " " Nobody would dare call you that . " ' " You said it , pal . " " Sometime , just for the fun of it , Duff , you and I 'll have to go out alone some night and get into a few fights . I think we could take care of such little matters and have some fun doing it . " " We sure could . Kid , you and me can go a long ways . We can knock ' em dead . " Duffy lit a cigarette and sat back in his chair , oozing conceit . " Duffy , can you do me a little favor ? " " Sure can , pal . " " My bank is out on the North Side , and I have a check I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present . Today is her birthday . " " Sure , no trouble at all . " " I hate to bother you . But if I ca n't get it cashed , why , then I have to go out north and come back here to get the present . It 's a lot of trouble . And I have a date . "  | " With the gal ? " " No , this is extra-curricular . " Duffy laughed . Ed laughed with him . " Well , let 's see  --  it 's one-thirty . I got to step on it , " Ed said . " All right , let 's go over to my bank . " They got up , and Ed did not demur when Duffy O'Tooletook his check for coffee . They stepped onto Randolph Street . " By the way , my check is for fifty bucks . Is that all right ? " " Sure . We 're pals . I 'm always glad to do a little favor for apal . " Ed handed him the check . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ed regretted that he had n't made the amount seventy-five dollars instead of fifty . She squeezed his hand . It was late , and they sat on a bench in Jackson Park , silent , languorous as the soft warm night . A bluish gray mist hung over the park and over them . Their clothes were damp and crumpled , and her hair was mussed . " I 'll worry about you , " she said . She did n't see his frown . But she sensed that he was staring at her in disapproval . " Ed , darling , what 's the matter ? " she asked . " You must not be a weakling . Worry  --  do n't even use the word . Do n't act like one of the puny members of the multitude . My sweetheart has to be strong . " " I will  --  " She paused . She spoke very slowly . " I will be strong . . . . But , Ed , you must take care of yourself . " " I 've done that successfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning how to take care of myself . Now , darling , I 'm going to achieve big things . I have an inspiration , and that is what I have always needed . You are my inspira-tion . " " And I have an inspiration , too . Ed , darling , you make me want to be better . And stronger . Darling , I 'll be waiting forp239you . And we 'll be so happy . We 'll have so many things to do together . " " You do n't know how much I 'll miss you , " he said . She still did n't understand why he had to leave . If he was going to miss her , why should he go ? " I 'm going forth to misery . " " But , dear , you often say that life is so short . If you know that , and know that you 're going to feel miserable , why do it ? " " I must . I said that I was going . If there were no other reasonmotivating me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to go . " " But , Ed , have n't you always told me that only a fool is always consistent ? " " But , Ellen , you see , I 'm consistent about my inconsistency . I have to be alone , to face the unknown . " So often he said things that made sense and were true . Now she did n't agree with him ; she did n't see why he had to go if these were his reasons . But she was going to be brave . He would love her more if she were strong . She would be strong . " You 'll write to me often ? " she said . " You know that I will . But , Sweet , will you write to me  --  every day ? " " I 'll write every day . Twice a day . I 'll write you all the time . " " I 'll need your letters . They will buoy up my spirits . You must think of me , alone , feeling miserable , missing you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my thoughts I 'll be living with you , and I 'll be thinking hard and dangerously , struggling to put down on paper the most subtle philosophy . For now I am ready to write my book . " He kissed her tenderly . " You will think of me , Sweet , always and all of the time ? " " Yes . " " And I will come through with flying colors . Then , for Mr. and Mrs. Lapson , the world will be our onion . " " I do n't like onions . "  | " You 'll like this onion . When we peel it , it wo n't cause us to shed tears . Yes , the world will be our onion , and we 're goingto know high times , peeling it to our hearts ' content . " She rested her head on his shoulder . " I 'll think of my Ellen Rogers , of her lips , her kisses . When I have felt the pressure of her lips on mine , I have known Beauty . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a rustle in the bushes . Ed looked up and saw a badge caught in a gleam of moonlight . " A cop . We got to beat it , " he said , breathing hard . He got to his feet , hastily trying to rearrange his clothing . She slid off the bench , her hair mussed , her clothes disheveled . She did n't know what to do . Ed took her hand , and they ran across the wet grass , pursued by a struggling flat-footed beefy policeman who yelled after them . They ran on . Ellen was breathless . Ed looked back . He saw that they were not being pursued . He pulled her on , and they passed through the bushes and came out on Sixty-seventh Street . She gasped for breath . He turned away from her to finish rearranging his clothes . They both burst out laughing . " I must look a sight , " she said . " Let 's get away from here . He might have gotten help , " Ed said . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south side of Sixty-seventh . She halted under a lamppost and hurriedly combed her hair and powdered her face . Ed then took her mirror and looked at himself . He laughed . " I 'm streaked with rouge . I 'm bleeding rouge . " " Why , you are ! " Again they laughed . " Ed , wipe it off . " " I will not . I 'll leave it on , and see if somebody does n't like it . " " Ed , you always tell me : Darling , your slightest wish is my command . ' "  | " It is . " " Well , if I want you to take the rouge off your face , will you ? " He reached for her mirror again , spat on his handkerchief , and wiped the streaks of rouge off his face . He combed his hair , straightened his tie , and cursorily brushed his suit with his hands . They strolled on aimlessly , up one street and down another , in the South Shore district . The streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ed , have you enough money ? " " Yes . Mother loaned me fifty dollars today , and then Father added twenty-five more to it . " " Ed , do n't be angry with me for what I 'm going to say . " " I could n't be angry with you . " " If you need money , you 'll write to me , wo n't you ? " " I wo n't need it . " " If you do ? " " Yes , I will , Sweet . It 's so kind , so sweet of you to say that . " They turned the corner of Seventieth and Euclid . " Ed , you will keep out of trouble ? " " Ellen , since I have met you , I have changed . I 'm going to settle down . From now on , when I live dangerously it will be here , " he said , pointing to his head . " And you are really going to write a book ? " " Do you doubt me ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know I do n't doubt you . It 's merely that I 'm so dumb that I ca n't understand how anyone can write a book . " " I need your faith in me in order to write . I 'm usually confidentand cocky , but about this proposition . . . . No . I 'm humble . After all , I have the greatest thinker the world ever knew as a model . I keep thinking of him , Nietzsche . I have something tremendous to surpass . " " You can do anything you want to . "   " Ellen , I 'll carry those very words of yours away with me as if they were flowers pressed close to my heart . Say them to me again . " " You can do anything you want to . " " With your faith and love , Hellfire ca n't fail . You 're all that he needed in his life . " " Honestly , am I ? " " More than you 'll ever know . " " Ed , I 'll be strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " And think of how much more wonderful , more beautiful it will be when we meet again . " She smiled at him , sweetly , sadly . Why must he go ? Again and again this question kept coming into her head . For a while she had refused to believe that he was going . But he was . What could she do ? They walked on . Suddenly it seemed as if there were nothing more to be said . Downstairs , in front of the building , they had kissed for the last time . They had said all the words there were to be said . She had watched him saunter off gaily with a song on his lips . He had looked back and blown her a kiss , and then he had gone on , swinging his arms . Was that the last she would ever see of him ? Ellen sank her head in the pillow and kicked her legs . She stretched out and lay in bed , tense . She would n't cry . She would be hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she would n't be a puny weakling . She was a woman now , and hard , too  --  a woman was capable of a great love because she was hard and like Ed . She would be worthy of him . Great love ? She thought of herself and Ed surprised on the park bench by the cop . It was funny . Ellen laughed . But she was in no mood for laughter . He wasleaving in the morning . Once he had called this journey hisquest . He used words so unusually , so differently from others . She told herself that she did n't have to think that the worstP243would happen . He loved her . She was certain he did . Perhaps absence would make him love her more . Two could play every game that one could play . When she wrote him she would state things in a veiled way in order to make him a little jealous . That might pull him back to her . But she had let her man , her wonderful man , slip through her fingers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . She and Ed were really in love . And because she had not tried to keep him , because she had made no false plays for his sympathy , he would love her all the more . If she had made scenes , he would feel that he could do what he wanted with her . His affection might have been weakened . But she had n't . He was so observant that he could not have missed noticing this . He would realize that Ellen had made no scenes . She had let him go when he said he must . This would bring him back to her arms . But she wanted Ed . She did n't want all these games , pretenses , sparrings . She wanted her Ed . She wanted him now , in bed with her , now , and always and forever . And he had gone away . Ellen brooded . Again and again she told herself that she would be hard and strong . She would not let herself cry .   May28,1925 Wash. , D. C. My Sweet : It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than from New York . En route , I changed my mind and my plans and decided I could make a bigger splash in the national capital than I could in New York . There should be all sorts of possibilities in Washington , and I 'm going to look into them . I thought that perhaps I might get myself lined up as a lobbyist . But so much for mundane trivia . What is that compared to what I really want to write to you ? And that is to tell you that I adore you . I think of you always . At the moment it is twenty minutes after two and the sun is shining . The same sun shines on you if you are outdoors now . I see the sun as a link between you and me . I am miserable . I am without my Ellen . I am alone , and my adored and adorable is miles and miles away . Nothing compensatesfor that distance which separates us . Ah , my sweet , the pathos of distance . I now have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am going to call it the Great Beginning . But even that is mundane trivia alongside of what lies on my heart now . Ellen , her pertness , the beauty of her lips , the light that shines in her eyes . But I will fight through the pangs of loneliness . I 'll come through this period of search , quest , discovery , and it will help to cement the more firmly the love of Ellen and her Hellfire . Think of me . Always . I will think of you . Always . Farewell for the moment , Your Adoring Hellfire  |p245P.S  . Hellfire is going to make a splash in Wash. , D. C. that will make his adorable proud of him yet . May 30th Darling EdSo many postcards and then your letter from Washington , the first letter I ever received from you . I knock on wood that it be not the last . Darling , your letter was so lovely , so beautiful . But what a surprise ! So you are in Washington . I thought it was necessary for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you turn up in Washington . Hellfire is full of no end of surprises . But for God 's sake , darling , do n't turn up next in Shanghai . You are gone only a few days , and how long it seems . Every hour is a day . But I want my Hellfire to know that Ellen has learned her lesson from him . She loves him , and he has taught her so much . She is going to be brave and hard and strong . She misses him with an ache in her heart , but she will dry her eyes and wait patiently , but bravely . She misses him . Kisses to you , kisses sent over miles of distance . And what a lovely phrase of yours  --  the pathos of distance . It has been ringing in my mind ever since your letter came this morning . But now , Ed dearest for news . It seems that the Great Hellfire left Chicago in the nick of time . The day after you left some policemen came . They had a warrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northrup , swore out a warrant , charging you with assault and battery . Fortunately I was home and saw the policemenwithout attracting any attention . If Father knew it , he would be fit to be tied . But I can handle Father . I told the policemen that you were , to my knowledge , not in town . I have done nothing since you left . Poor Frank tries to be sweet and calls me up . But I say I am busy . How can I go out with Frank after Hellfire ? Darling , I love you miss you . I bless you . I send you kisses across the pathos of distance . I am thinking of you . Take care of yourself . Your book will be lovely . Take care of yourself and write me . I loved your letter . Many many many xxxxxxxxxx'sYour EllenJune 1st , 25 Sweet : At last , a letter from my adored . But I was disappointed in the letter I received . Perhaps I was so hungry to hear from my Sweet that my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter caused me concern . You say that you are going to be brave and hard and strong . Does that mean that you are going to forget me , here , alone , miles away from you in a strange city ? I hate to ask the question . But I was dismayed by the tone of your letter . It did cause me concern . I received it after tramping around in the heat , and I was dog tired . I went to the post office full of hopes , eager . I tore your letter open , and I read it like a famished man . I was let down . Sweet , if our love is going to become matter-of-fact , it will be bad . Perhaps you will become so hard and strong and brave that you can dispense with me . I write this way because my heart aches for you . I think of what you might be doing at this minute , that minute  --  every minute . I try to visualize you in my mind . I think of you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm mapping out plans . That is the first stage . The next will be contacts . After I have mapped out my strategy , I 'll take the next step . I 'm confident that I am going to get on to something good here . My main idea right now is something in the line of a lobbyist . I figure that I should be a good lobbyist , and there is lots of money in it and the work . is n't hard . After all , what do you do but see Congressmen and Senators and give them a sales talk . It 's a good beginning . But of course , I have to look the ground over . I had a fine time last night . I read in the library until ten o'clock , and then wandered home , strolling along , singing . P247Do you know what I sang ? All Alone . I thought of you as I strolled home to my room . I 'm living at the Y.M.C.A. I have a clean room . It 's a card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fellows there . They 're atheists like me . We had a rousing time the night before last . We bought a little gin and sat in my room talking , and we gave God and Jesus a workout in my room , in the Young Men 's Christian Association . Is n't that a card ? But all such mundane matters , what do they count ? Why waste paper on them when there are more important things to tell you ? What are these ? Three trivial little words that seem so simple , that have been said so many times , but that are a world of feelings , sentiments , emotions , desires , worries ... Sweet  --  I love you . You send me your love in a letter , I send you my love in a song . But ah , ah , that I were a singer  --  a poet . I should like to be a poet , I would garland your name with verses . I would make Ellen a more beautiful name than Swinburne 's Felise , The sweetest name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am no poet . All I can do is send you from my heart words that are banal , simple , that are cold on paper . I love you . But do n't write me in return that you are too hard and brave and strong . These words in your lovely hand stare coldly at me , like ice . Alone in a strange city , I read these words . And they caused me worry , anxiety . Hellfire misses Ellen . I think of you , you do n't know how much . I am brave and strong and hard , and yet , yet a hundred times over , I am unbearably lonely . . . without Ellen . Always adoring my Sweet , Your Ed . P.S. So Bill Northrup has a warrant out for me . Assault and battery . Chalk that up on my record . Tell him to have the cops look long and carefully for me . By the time I come back to get you , perhaps he will be just recuperating from the e f -  fects of the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another pleasant rendezvous again . P.S. I put a little x at the bottom of my letter . How pale a symbol for a kiss on those lips of yours , lips from which beauty is drunk like nectar . Au revoirE . June 1 , 1925 Ed DarlingThis morning I dashed down to the mail box the minute I got out of bed . And there was no letter . Are you all right ? Are you well ? Are you in trouble ? Do you need anything ? You do n't begin to know how blank the day seems to me . I do n't know what to think . Ed , do n't treat me this way . Write to me , you must , every day . I wrote to you about how brave and hard and strong I was going to make myself for you . But I have to hear from you , and when I do n't hear , I am worried , for fear lest something has happened to you . Ed you promised to write me every day . I need your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important . I never thought much of the mail man before in my whole life . Last night I went to a movie with Gertrude Dorgan . Afterwardwe had hot chocolate . These days , I feel so sorry for Gertrude . I feel so sorry for every girl in the world . Guess why ? Three guesses , but I 'll penalize you if you do n't guess right the first time . Gertrude says that she saw Catherine Anne . Catherine Anne asked her about you and me . Poor Gertrude . It must be terrible to be lame and ugly . In his first letter Hellfire did n't tell me very much of what he does . Everything he does interests me . Even if he walks down a street . I 'd like to know which street it is , and what it looks like . And he has n't told me much about Washington . Is it a beautiful city ? Do you like it better than Chicago ? Would you and I be happier there than in Chicago ? I have so many questions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seems so many years since you left . How soon will you be settled ? I hope it is very soon . Ed my darling , if you only knew how much I miss you . When you were here the days were so short . Now the days are so long . Father asks after you . I think he admires what you did . He has to . Everybody has to admire my Hellfire . The world has to pay tribute to him because he is just that wonderful . Ed , please write me . Do n't let me go through more mornings like this morning. xYour EllenJune 3 , 1925 My dearest EdYour letter of June 1st just came . I have read it over three times . It was so wonderful to hear from you . But , Ed , you must not be concerned and anxious over me . When I wrote that I was going to try to be brave and strong and hard , it was for you . I meant that I was not going to wear my heart on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all closed and warm and waiting only for you . You poor thing alone in a strange city ! It makes me feel sad . And it was such a lovely letter you wrote . It was so thoughtfulof you to tell inc that you wished you were a poet so that you could make my name like Felise . Ed , you are a darling . And you are so subtle . What are the atheists in the Y.M.C.A. like ? And what are their names ? Tell me about them . Tell me about yourself , about Washington , about your fine , wonderful , subtle thoughts . When you begin writing your book send what you do on to me . Oh , it will be grand to see you write that book . But everything you do is grand . My Hellfire has style  --  I am so proud of him  --  so proud I could sing all the time . Sure you could be a lobbyist , whatever that really is . Poor me , I know nothing about politics . But you could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you how much promise you have in soP250many ways . Why , you could be anything you want to be , if you set yourself to it . Is your room cosy ? Is it comfortable ? Is it too warm in Washington ? If it is , do n't wear yourself out tramping the streets . Are the buildings beautiful ? When will you be meeting the President , and when will you be President ? But my lovely , in all the excitement of Washington , do n't forget your little Ellen , waiting for you , waiting with her heart kept guarded and storing up love , so much love too for just you . Just because you 're you . Letters are so unsatisfactory . Ed , do n't think that my letters are cold or matter-of-fact . They 're not . When I sit down to write to you , oh , how I wish I could write marvelous letters the way you can . But I ca n't . All I can do is spill out to you that I am thinking of you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you , thinking of your wonderfulvoice and handsome face and curly hair , and yes thinking of other things about you , too . Ed , you have made me grow up . I am a woman now . When I met you I was a little girl , yes , I was a silly little girl . But you taught me so much and I am a different person . I hope I am a better person . I am a woman waiting for letters from her beloved , and waiting for the day when I can take him in my arms and let him go to sleep on my shoulder . I have so much faith in you , more than words can tell . I know you will make good . It is written in the stars . And make good fast for your Ellen who misses you , and pines and pines for you . Write me Ed , gobs of letters . I never can get enough lettersfrom you . YourEllen with trillions of xxxxxx 's . June 3 Ellen , lovelier than Felise : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference in time betweenChicago and Washington is one hour . At twelve o'clock on June fifth , I shall look at the moon . That will be elevenP25Io'clock . Chicago time . Look at the moon at that moment . I shall be looking at the silver and lucent orb and thinking of you . You look at it and think of me . Think that there are only the two of us in the world looking at the moon , and that its silvery dazzling rays are spilling out of the sky only for us . Do n't think me silly in telling you to do this . It will be a form of communion between us . Always and always yoursExxxxxxxxxxJune 5 , 25 Sweetest EdI just came in off the balcony . Was n't the moon lovely ? And it was such a poetic idea of yours for me to look at the moon , and for you to look at the moon at the same minute . I stood on the balcony . Oh , such a night as this . And just as if it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never realized that there were so many stars in the sky  --  and I saw a shooting star . I thought that 's like my Ed . Sweetheart , I looked at the moon just as you asked me to . I blew it kisses , thinking those kisses would go to the moon and become rays that cross Ed 's face . Oh , I miss you so . I am happy . And I am so sad . Do hurry up and make good , for I miss you so much . I 'll write again tomorrow morning first thing . I 'm running out to mail this letter now for you . I love you always always , forevermore with kisses EllenJune 6 , 1925 Sweet : Did you look at the moon ? It was a thrilling experience , becausetrusting as I am , I thought that you did , and that there was between us something that was sacred . Do n't laugh at theP252word . It was the way I felt . Here , it was a fine night too . Cool , after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all day , waiting , waiting for the moment when by doing such a seeminglysilly thing as gaze upon the moon , I would establish a feeling , a fiction of contact . There is a German book of philosophyby a man called Vaihinger , The Philosophy of As If . He talks about fictions . We really know fiction . The world is as if . I thought of this last night . I thought what a lovely fiction , the lovelist of all fictions , a fiction of love . What was it ? That Hellfire at one end of the world and Ellen , miles away , could gaze upon that cold orb of ice , the moon , and that their thoughts went out in a way that deepened their love and feeling for one another , and that gave them  --  at least me  --  such consolation such gratification . Do n't think me sentimental for writing you these letters . I wish that I could invent a whole new vocabulary just to tell you how adorable you are . Words are paltry things . But accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissesJune 8thMy loveWhat a lovely letter . You are ' so thoughtful . And you are so humble . You write me letters that are so enchanting and humbly say they are sentimental . Silly ? You adorable charminglovely wonderful unexcelled  --  Ed . But do n't say your words are fictions . Do n't say that they are as if . I do n't care if all the philosophers in the world write books like the one you mentioned . I do n't care about books and philosophers this minute . I care about Ed . Sweetheart tell Inc more about what you are doing . You write me the most wonderful letters , but I want more , more oh , so much more . I want every little scrap of information about you . Are you lonesome ? Do you know any people ? Are you making progress ? Please , please , please pretty please make progress so that I can have my Hellfire back again . And don'tp253get in any fights . Please do n't . And how are you getting along ? Oh , tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about you . If you only knew how much . I was walking through Jackson Park yesterday . Guess why ? Because it made me remember you . I walked and walked . I was so lonesome . I missed you so much . How can I describe how much I missed you ? You say words are paltry . Yours are not . But Ed , sweet Ed , divine Ed , mine are . How can I tell you how much I missed you . Would that I could . I saw you all over the park . And you were not there . I walked and walked until I was simply exhausted just because I missed you . I tried to imagine you by my side . I thought of you walking with me and singing . Oh , Ed , when will I hear that dear voice of yours break out into song ? When ? Make progress . Be the greatest lobbyist in the world and do it soon , right away . You can . Because I miss you . I have a new dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while . What is a new dress when I have no Ed to look at it ? What care I for anybody else looking at it ? Six fellows called me up for dates . Know what I said ? No , no , no , no , no , no , no , no . I dreamed of you last night . Silly dream and silly me . I dreamed that you were President . Ed , write me letters and letters and letters . Write me and tell me everything about yourself . Write me how you are getting along . Do you need anything ? Oh write me . I think of the silliest things . This morning when I woke up , I lay in bed and I thought , would n't it be wonderful if I could make a wish to see Ed and then see him ? Am I foolish ? Honeychild Ed , just to think of you makes me so sad . I miss you so terribly . Kisses and you know what else. your EllenJune 10th , 1925 Ellen darling girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think I feel ? I miss you  --  the very sight of you  --  your lips  --  your warm andP254open arms . You are home , in familiar surroundings . I am alone in a strange city . What do I do ? You should pose the question differently ? Outside of thinking of Ellen , missing her , yes , pining for her , what do I do ? I do n't have time to do much else . What else do I do ?  --  how unimportant . Oh , why bother about such meager details ? Know this . You are in my mind and my heart all of the time , every minute , waking and sleeping . You fill my dreams like a song that causes pain . That 's what I do . For the rest . I read , and I survey the situation . I have a new idea . Of course it will require a little capital , and I have to find that . But for Hellfire , what is impossible ? Conceit ? Yes , it is conceit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it if Ellen trusts me , has faith in me . My idea is a clever one . I have not worked out all of the details , but I have thought about it and the general plan is there . It is much better than my idea of being a lobbyist . Here it is . Congressmen have to be re-elected every two years . They must keep in the public eye . Why ca n't I work out a system of getting them publicity ? After all , with my fertile imagination , think of all the stunts I could contrive to pull off . It takes time to work out plans like these carefully , and I have spent a great deal of time applyingmy mind to this idea . The time I spent thinking out the lobbyist angle is waste in one sense , and in another it is n't , because after all , I did think about things , survey and canvass the situation , and learn something . Sweet , there is nothing to worry about except one thing only . Not to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only that , could be a calamity . For the rest , why nothing ill could befall Hellfire . You know that . No calamity can overtake me . Why , I am one up on fate every day in the week . Now , my Sweet , worry ill befits a girl as adorable as you . Worry ill befits you for another reason . You are not one of the hoi polloi . You are not a weakling of the multitude . You are far superior to that . You and I will raise one another up . So  --  cease worrying . Ah , adorable , more adorable than Felise , lovelier than Faustine , ah , my one and only incomparable Ellen , ah , thatP255time would permit me to write even more . Adieu for the moment . YourEd123456789 times 123456789 millions of kisses to Ellen . P.S. What happened to that warrant against me for assault and battery ? June 19th , 1925 Ellen my Sweet Felise : I received many letters from you . And if you only knew how much I treasure them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I constantly take it out and read it . But , Ellen , sweetest , I must ask you to have faith and trust in me . I need it badly . I have been less than diligent in writing to you , but you must , you will understand . It is very difficult to get launched here . I am fed up , but I will not quit . I have scouted around a lot , and I think that if I can hang on by my teeth a little while , I can connect in a big way . But in the meantime it has been very difficult . I have been struggling with myself . I have had my periods and my moments of let-down . At times I have not written you because I did not want to cause you worry . I was in such black moods that I feared even to put pen to paper lest I convey these moods to you . But , Ellen , Ellen so wonderful , I know that you will understand . I can not quit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with temporary embarrassments . Sweet , could you send me any money ? I hate to ask you , but I can think of no one in all the world to whom I should turn before turning to you . You are closer to me than any human being on this sorry , paltry little planet . That is why I turn to you . You will understand what a wrench it is to my pride . But there are things in life that are of greater significance than pride . I could appeal to others and get the wherewithal to keep me going through this first and most difficult period . But I have given the whole question much thought . I have come to this conclusion . I owe it to Ellen to write to her first . Ellen would , I have reasoned , be disappointedP256in me were I to write to others on this matter , rather than to her . I can hang on with this sum until something breaks . I am full of plans . One day , I was walking down PennsylvaniaAvenue  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it occurred to me  --  why should Hellfire waste his talents trying to get the mug of some dumb Congressman in the paper for the booboisie back home ? Why should I devote my energiesto getting one set of morons to look with pleasure on another set of morons whom they elect to make dumb laws for the slaves ? So I put my mind to the problems at hand and decided that what I would do would be canvass Washington with the idea of direct-by-mail advertising schemes . Washingtonis fertile . Now I am preparing to do this . I can succeed in my plans here , and do it much more quickly than I could with the other plans I have discarded . So that is what I am going to do . But I have to hang on . Ellen , I am beastly disgusted with life . It is beastly hot . But I will not give up . I 'll hang on . And I 'll make you proud of me . And do n't you worry . And do n't you be jealous . What girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think of such a question . Oh , my sweet , do n't make it harder for your Ed . Think of me and I will think of you , often and always . YourEdP.S . Out of the night that covers meBlack as the Pit from pole to pole , I thank whatever gods may beFor my unconquerable soul . And for my Ellen . P.S. It is wiser to write me General Delivery . I have changed quarters . It is a small comfortable rooming house . But I do n't like nosey people looking at mail from the sweetest girl that ever lived when it is laid on the table downstairs . P.S. Ah , my sweetheart how I miss you this very minute ! Kisses in superabundanceE . Your E.P257Not a breath of air stirring . Such heat ! Such a frying pan ! Such a town ! How could any man with brains have any ambitionin the inferno called Washington , D. C. ? Wearing his B.V.D. 's , Ed lay on the couch in his **32;6390;TOOLONG , reading James Branch Cabell 's The Rivet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tanned . The small room was in disorder . His clothes were tossed in a heap with soiled feminine underthings . But it was too hot to worry about a little disarray . He put his book aside and picked up a towel to mop his face . The sight of the apartment filled him with sudden disgust . On a day like this the joint did n't have to be such a mess . But then there was nothing to do unless he wanted to straighten out things himself . He would n't mind doing it , except for the heat , and for his dignity . Hilda was bringing home the bacon for him , and he did n't want to turn himself into her chief cook and bottle-washer . So there was nothing to do but bear the mess . Elisa , Hilda 's maid , had n't shown up today . She must have gotten herself ginned up with some black buck boy in Alexandria where she lived . But then , what difference did it make ? Hilda would be home soon from work and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some place along the Potomac . They ought to go back to that fish place and have supper there . He 'd received another letter from Ellen . God , why did that woman take things so seriously ? One subject that old Hellfire had really gotten to know was that which concerned the femi/nine heart . He could pride himself on never having made a mistake in strategy or technique with a female . The slavemindedand the conventional of this world would call him a sonofabitch . From their point of view he was an S.O.B . Ah , what fools there were ! The idealization of woman was pernicious , a curse  --  a curse particularly to a man with intelligence . Women were selfish , in their fashion . They were like leeches , and when they attached themselves to a man they sucked every bit of independence out of him . When he had strolled around Washington , observing , studying , looking , he had seen much to reinforce these conclusions . He had seen so many of the governmentclerks with their wives , window-shopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rings . What a picture ! What a story it told ! These tight little girls , these Catherine Annes , had all gotten their men , and they were holdingthem captives with hooks of steel . How smug they were . And these little clerks who toiled away in the Department of Agriculture , the Department of the Interior , all the other damned departments of the government , growing old , knowingnot what it means to live , no exaltations , no adventures , never in their lives enjoying the romance of their own egotism . They would grow old with a burden of installment payments on their backs ; they would grow old with contented bovine little Catherine Annes who had gotten their men and were keeping their possession by hell , heaven , and high water . He lit a cigarette and mopped his brow . Ah , the chasm that separated Washington , D. C. , from Poictesme . Contrast Hilda and the women of Poictesme . But then , Hilda had her place and her function . She was inferior to Ellen , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellen  --  ah , Ellen ! He must write her a letter that would put her heart at ease . For he really did care for her . I have been faithful to thee , Cynara , in my fashion . What plans should he make ? Should he return to Chicago and to Ellen ? No , he could n't go back defeated . He had to catch on to something . Go on to New York , New Orleans , Galvestonp259and go to sea ? Go to New York ? Well , all this could be taken care of in due time . It was too hot even to think . In the morning when Hilda was at work he 'd write a letter to Ellen . She would be home from the Department of Agricultureany minute . Ellen had been so adorable , so pert and sweet , so lovely . But his absence from her would be good for her soul . Still , it would be fun to be on the beach with her now , to look at her body in a swimming suit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lap , waiting for darkness to spread over the lake , and to sing to her out of sheer happiness and exaltation . Yes , he loved Ellen in his fashion . He had merely been fed up with Chicago . Suddenly it had occurred to him that it was time to shove off . So here he was in Washington , D. C. , the capital of the nation , the home of Cal himself . However , he would give Washington its due . It did have its attractions , and these were pleasant enough in their fashion before the weather had become unbearable . Washingtonwas a city whose main attraction was the government girls . They came from all over the nation and they were to be found in Washington in superabundant quantities . And , oh , the government should know something about the government girls . Back home in the corn belt , the cow belt , the Bible Belt , back home in the provinces , these girls had probably been looked upon as sweet and innocent homebodies . Perhaps they were . Hilda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls got to Washington . . . . He laughed . It was a card , amusing to think about . And after all was said and done , what could you expect when a lot of Congressmen were let loose ? The funniest he had ever met was the Indian , Josephine . He had never seen an Indian before , except wooden ones in front of cigar stores . But Josephine was a live , honest-to-God Indian girl . Ah , my sweet papoose . He had Josephine all doped out . She was too dumb , almost too dumb to have fallen for him . Thank God , if such there be , that Josephine did n't work in the Department of Agriculture where Hilda did . JosephineP260was in the Department of the Interior . But she was so cold . She was not worth all the time and effort he gave to making her . A whole week of his life had gone into that effort . But even Josephine had fallen for him and he 'd had to move . After the night he 'd made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week . He had moved . It was n't any use sending her that last verse from Felise . She would n't understand it . Ah , the little ironies , the little stories , the people you met along the waysides of life . He squashed his cigarette and lit another one . He picked up his book again , puffed on his cigarette , and read . Why think of Indian girls and Washington , D. C. , when his spirit could roam in the deliciously ironical and beautiful pages of Cabell ? " Hellfire . " " Hilda knows my name , " Ed replied , getting up as she let herself in . She went to him , kissed and hugged him . " This goddamned heat is insulting . It is an unwarranted piece of cosmic insolence . " " Ed , I almost died at work today . " " Who in the hell had the idea of making Washington the national capital ? In this heat . And , my God , I ca n't go out of the house . That convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America has gathered here . I almost teed off on one of the Odd Fellows yesterday , crowding over the sidewalk as if he owned it . And he was dressed up in his monkey suit , too . " Oh , Ed , they 're not so bad . " He frowned . His B.V.D. 's fitted him badly , hanging around the seat in an undignified swirl . " Hilda , have you deserted to the other camp ? " " Ed , you talk so funny . " " So the Odd Fellows are n't so bad ? "   " Why get excited about them ? They never did anything to me . " " They have to me . " " What ? Did one of them cause you any trouble ? " " They all have . The entire organization of Odd Fellows . " " What did they do to you ? " " They exist . " " Ed , you 're so funny . " " I would n't call that a neat choice of adjectives . " She flopped down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm hot , " she said . Ed lit a cigarette and looked at Hilda . He decided that she was not up to Ellen . There was something of the thoroughbred in Ellen . In some ways she was like a fine race horse. , Hilda was a pretty little thing . She was trim . Her legs were neat and thin , as good as Ellen 's , and she had lovely little breasts that stood up straight , almost a virgin 's breasts , although Hilda was twentyfive . She was brown-eyed , snub-nosed , and had thin little lips . And her ears . He appreciated her little ears and liked to pretend that he would bite them . " I 'm hot and I 'm all tired out . You might be tired of Odd Fellows , Ed , but do you know what I 'm tired of ? " " Me ? " " Oh , stop that ! I 'm tired of hogs , cattle , feed , fertilizer . " " We all , some day , must become fertilizer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of all beautiful things . " " Ed , take a bath with me , " she said , getting up and beginning to undress . Ed leaned back in the wooden booth , puffing on a cigarette . The restaurant was crowded ; there was a steady echo of talk from all the booths and tables . Sweating Negro waiters rushed about carrying plates . " What 'll we do tonight , Hilda ? "   " I do n't know . Anything . Oh , Ed , my darling , how did I find you ? " He smiled . " How did I find you ? " she repeated . " Just think , I have only known you ten days , and we have only lived together a week , and it seems that we have lived forever . Together . Forever together , " Hilda said . " I often feel as if I had lived forever . " " Ed , you sometimes talk in a way that makes me think there must have been great sadness in your life . " Ed 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget the past , " she said . " I do n't like to speak of it . " " Ed , tell me . Ed , I love you . Maybe I can make you forget . " " It 's humiliating even to think of it . " " I do n't care . I love you . " " Sweet , I 'll tell you . Did you ever hear of Sappho , the Greek poet ? " " Who ? " " Sappho was a Lesbian . Do you know what that is ? " She smiled at him . " I was married . She was a beautiful girl , almost as beautiful as you . I was young . I did n't know better . I was swept off my feet . I married her . Her name was Faustine . A strange name , is n't it ? She was a strange girl . But I was young . I had a good job , too . I was making a lot of money , one hundred and fifty dollars a week . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chump and for some fellow to serve as a cover for her . " " She must have been awful . A terrible bitch . " Ed laughed deprecatingly . " Forget it , it 's a joke . Why , traveling salesmen tell stories about how husbands come home and find somebody else , preferablya traveling salesman , in their wives ' beds . Well , it 's funny , too , to come home and find a woman in bed with your wife . " " No , it is n't . It 's terrible . I hate people like that . " " I was young and full of illusions . This ordeal shattered them.  |p263I  threw up everything , threw all the work I had done overboard . That 's why I came to Washington . Do you know that when I met you I was on the verge of suicide ? " She looked at him with pity and reached across the table to squeeze his hand . " Get me a cup of coffee , " he ordered the passing waiter . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you what I went through , " he said . " God , what a bitch ! " " Well , I 'm charitable . Nothing 's good nor bad but thinking makes it so . I just was n't strong enough . I always said that I was beyond good and evil . But it was a jolt . Not that I was morally shocked . It was a terrible blow to my illusions . All , illusions , illusions , man is full of them . They destroy our balance . But what would we have without illusions ? What ? Just the miserable little paltry commonplaces of life  --  fertilizer , pigs , cows , cattle , the seething dullness of the market place . Ah , illusions . Hilda , we will preserve our illusions . " " Yes , Ed . " The Negro waiter set another cup of coffee before lid . " It has taken me four years to recover from the shock . I cursed the day I ever met Faustine . " " I 'm jealous of her . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull past . The past is a bucket of ashes . " Ed laughed again , deprecatingly . " But sometimes the ashes taste bitter in your mouth . " " I hate her . I never saw her and I hate her . " " Those who live in glass houses should pull down the shades , Hilda . " " Ed , what do you mean ? " " I 'm jealous , too . I 'm jealous of the men you 've known . " " They meant nothing to me . If I had known I was going to meet someone like you some day , I would have saved myself . " " But if you had , then you would n't have been you . You would have been somebody else . I 'm glad you did n't . Not that I 'm not jealous . I 'm glad , because it 's you I love . You would have been different if you had met me a virgin , much different.  | 64 Hilda , virtue may be its own reward , but experience teaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have been my teacher . " " And you are my teacher . " " Ed , I have something to say . " " What ? " he asked , puffing on a cigarette again . " I am engaged to be married . " He frowned . " But I 'm breaking it off . " " Why did n't you tell me ? " " Ed , I was afraid to . And I did n't think . " " You deceived me . " " But , Ed , I 'm telling you now . " " You deceived me , Hilda . " " Oh , Ed , I did n't think it was important . " " Perhaps it was n't , " he said . She smiled broadly , happy . He watched her closely . " Perhaps it was n't important to you that you deceived me . " " Oh , Ed , please do n't say such things to me . " " It is n't pleasant , Hilda . It disturbs me , distresses me . " " Ed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth . The fellow from home in Kansas City , his name is Charley White , I never let him even touch me . Honest I did n't . Is n't that enough to show you ? Ed , let 's get married this minute . That will prove to you , wo n't it , that I did n't really deceive you ? " " I 'm a pauper . A pauper . " " I do n't care . I do n't . I love you . Oh , let the government supportus . I make money . We can live . " Hilda opened her purse and got a bill . She reached across the table with her right hand cupped and slipped a five-dollar bill to Ed . He got up and signaled for the waiter peremptorily . Ed and Hilda leaned over the railing of the stone bridge , gazingat the dark , flowing water of the Potomac . " It 's so romantic . " " Ah , illusions . The water , dark and mysterious . It 's justP265water , merely a river . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , H.O . Look at the way the moon dances on it . The rays of the moon seem like creatures , wonderful strange creatures . Illusions . Look up at the moon . " She looked at the moon ; so did he . It was round , full , bluish . " It seems like something precious . Look at it , so big , round , full , so beautiful . Why ? Because it is so far away . Up close it is a huge , cold and uninhabited stellar body . Illusions . " " Oh , Ed , I do n't care . Call it whatever you like . I love it . " " But you , Hilda , you 're not an illusion . You 're real . I would n't trade you for the light of the moon that shimmers on the dark waters of the Potomac . I would n't change you for the moon . Look across at the darkness beyond the edge of the bridge . There lies the whole state of Virginia . I would n't trade you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ed , honey , take me home . " She clung to him and again kissed him passionately . The kitchenette apartment was clean , and they sat by the table near the window with the dinner dishes before them . Ed pushed his coffee cup aside and lit a cigarette . " I 'll tell him that I 'm married to you , " Hilda said . " But that 's a lie . " " But I do n't want the people back home to think things about me . " Kansas City ! Who cares about Kansas City ? " " I do . " " That 's because you 've not freed yourself . You 're not yet a free spirit . " " Oh , Ed , why be foolish ? I do n't want my friends back there to know . After all , I want to keep my job and not get in any trouble . " " Jobs , jobs . Nobody in Washington thinks of anything else . Here everybody wants a job , and then a better job . Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the nationalP266capital . Here it is the seat of government . Here the sage wise men make laws , and here is concentrated all the dignity of the country . Every time you turn around , a building or a monumentsticks in your face . This burg is a mausoleum . All the dead in it think of a job . Washington 's a public feed trough , that 's what it is . " " What 's wrong with it ? " " Oh , nothing . Why do I care if the people , the nation , is fooled ? I should worry . Hell , I 'm not a humanity-savior . " " Ed , sometimes you talk so funny . " " Ah , funny ! Yes , I talk funny . Funny ! " " Sometimes I ca n't make you out . " " What did you say his name was ? " " Charley White . " She did not speak for a moment . " Ed , I 'll say I 'm married . I do n't want to see him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That would be cowardly . You must face him . " " But it 's so foolish . I do n't love him . I do n't want to see him . Honey , I do n't ever want to love anybody again but you . " " See him . Perhaps we can use him . " " But what 'll I tell him ? " " Sweetheart , listen to me . I 'd better take a room somewhere . And you act as if you were still engaged to him . " " But why ? Why  --  when I do n't want to ? " " We might use him . How ? I 'll figure that out . " " Oh , Ed , please , let 's not . " " All right . We wo n't , " Ed said ; he left the table . She watched him . He put on his hat and coat and started to walk out of the apartment , his face surly . She ran to him and clutched at him from behind . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What 's the matter , Ed ? " she asked , an expression of horrorconquering her features . " Nothing . " " The way you act to me . " " You refuse to take my advice . All right , you needn't. "  | " I will . I 'll do anything you say . Only please do n't act that way . Ed , I love you , " she said . He remained cold , forcing her to continue kissing him . Finally , he permitted himself to respond to her embrace . Ed sat at the desk in his room at the Y.M.C.A. He sealed the envelope of the letter he had just written to Ellen . It ought to put her a little bit at ease . He was getting fed up with Washingtonand perhaps he would go back to Chicago . Of course , returning was like an admission of defeat . But whose defeat was it ? After all , what standard was there to apply to defeat ? Was it defeat that he did n't feed at the public trough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some useless job ? Defeat ? How could that be defeat ? Ellen would n't really think it was defeat . She would be so glad to have him home . He 'd hinted in his letter to her , too , that he was getting fed up , but he 'd also written that he had finally landed a job in the Department of Agriculture . That would allay her worries . He would go back soon and say to her that he 'd given up a good job for her because he could not stand to be separated from her any longer . He smiled . Hilda was out with her fiance tonight . He had insisted that she do it . He was supposed to go to her place at one o'clock and see her . Hilda was a nice girl , but she had conventional ideas . If he were fool enough to marry her , she would change . He guessed that they all did . There was a deep-seated selfishness in a woman in love and if she married , society considered her actions moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapped his fingers in contempt of society . A woman would take a man 's freedom and turn him into an appendage to her , dictate his life , cry , put on the martyr act  --  what would n't she do to hold and dominate her man ? Love between the sexes was war . He whistled , deciding that he 'd stroll around and go to the library and read tonight . Something of Nietzsche would be aP268tonic . And he had to get back to thinking about that book he would write . He really intended to write it . He carefully tied his tie , put a little powder on his face , greased and combed his curly hair , put his straw hat on at a jaunty angle , and left his room . " Ed , he tried to make me tonight , " Hilda said as they lay in bed , lassitudinous . " Yes ? " " I hated him when he did . And he got mad . He said we were going to be married . I said : No , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much he respected me , I was glad I learned about his real nature in time . He 's so smug . He 's so conventional . " " He should have been here for the Odd Fellows ' convention last week . " " Oh , honey , know what ? " " I could n't know what , unless you told me . " " Know what I adore ? " r'Je t'adore . " " What 's that ? " " I adore you , in French . " " Do you speak French ? " " A little . " " Say something for me . " " Some other time . " He lit a cigarette . " Hilda , I 've been thinking . I have a plan . " " Yes , Ed , " she said , and then she waited for him to continue . " I 'm going to locate in Washington . " " Honey , in the fall , when the heat is over , we can have so much fun here together . " " I ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to run back and settle all my affairs back home and see my folks , and then settle here . " She looked at him , anxious.  | " Honey , you 're going away ? " " Just to settle my affairs . I 'll only be gone a week or ten days . " " Ed , are you telling me the truth ? " A sulky expression crossed his face . " Ed , please , you must tell me the truth . " He sat up in bed , exposed from the waist up , his torso swarthy and perfectly modelled , his arms strong and firm , but slender . He did not speak . His expression was icy . " You question me ? " he asked , his voice melodramatic . " Ed , you know I do n't . " " You ask me to tell you the truth as if I were capable of lying to you , deceiving you . " She began to cry . Allowing her to cry , he stared coldly at the wall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back here to me . Oh , I 'll miss you . Will you write to me every day ? " " Are you sorry for what you said ? " She kissed him and nestled her head against his shoulder . He put his left arm around her . " I 'll write to my lovely pagan enamorata , " he said tenderly . She wiped away her tears with the back of her hand , streakingher face . " How are you going to travel ? " " Freight . " " Oh , you ca n't . It 's dangerous . I 'll die of worry . " " I ca n't be a chooser . " " Ed , no , you ca n't go that way . You must n't do that . " " It 's a good idea . To leave Washington by a freight train and then to return and knock the town dead . " " Ed , honey , you wait until my next payday . I 'm short because of your rent at the Y.M.C.A. and our other expenses . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You wo n't have enough to live on . " " Oh , I do n't care . I 'll get it . " " How ? " She thought a moment.  | " Why do n't you borrow it off this fellow , White ? He has it , has n't he ? " Ed asked . " Yes , he has . But , no , I hate to . " " Do n't be so foolish . People like him exist so that they may be used by people like you and me . He 'd marry you and ruin your life by making you into a meek little Mrs. Wife , never knowing adventure , robbing life of all illusions , making you into nothing but a sweet little missus . He 's selfish in his way . What he would do to you would be to stamp out of you all flair , all esprit , all color and beauty . That 's the highest form of selfishness . People like him are to be used . I have an idea . " She gaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You tell him that you signed a note for a girl friend , and that if you do n't make it good the loan firm will garnishee your wage with the government , and that if that happens , you 'll get in trouble with your boss and might even lose your job . He 'll fall for that and you 'll get the hundred . I can go home and come back on that without pinching you , and then , when I come back , I 'll get down to the serious business of landing a job . " " But , Ed . " " Of course , I can travel on a freight train . I do n't think that I 'll lose a leg or that anything harmful will happen to me . " She looked at him , horror-stricken . " Ed , when should I tell him ? " " Write him after he leaves . " She thought a minute . " Ed , I do n't like to ask him for anything . " " Look at it this way . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function  --  to be used . Hilda , you and I are not part of the greedy little multitude . We 're different . " She kissed him passionately . " My pagan love girl , " he said , turning out the light . Afterward , with the light on again , Hilda gazed at him . " Ed , you 're a god , " she said . P271Ed sat by the train window , looking out as the train raced on across open country . He slouched back in his seat and let his eyes drift to the ceiling . Well , an episode closed . Charming in some ways , amusing in others . Hilda had been sad kissing him good-bye . She would get over it . She would some day be grateful to him for giving her as much of himself as he had . He had earned what he had gotten from her . My god , she had never had a love affair like the one with him . But he 'd almost forgotten something . He took out his little book , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him he put down the name White , and after it , a hundred dollars . This one was a card . He was glad to be going back . Ellen would be fresh and new , charming . She did n't know he was coming home either . He would surprise her , thereby making his return more delightful . Hilda had cried as the train pulled out . Time would dry her tears . How should he handle her by mail ? Send her a verse from Fe'lise ? Well , he 'd see about that . Good-bye Washington , Cal Coolidge , monuments , public buildings , government girls , Indians . . . . good-bye , Hilda ! He smiled again . He closed his eyes and tried to visualize Ellen . It was difficult . She had blonde hair , blue eyes , a mobile face . But somehow he could n't just place her face clearly in his mind . Well , he would be seeing her soon . He opened his eyes . Come to think of it , he had n't had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an automobile had almost run him down . He 'd shaken his fist after the sonofabitch , and challenged him to come back , but the car had gone on . Again , farewell , Washington , D. C. Farewell , Hilda . He looked out at green countryside as the train raced and clattered along . P275Ed swung along Sixty-seventh Street at a good pace . His straw hat was slanted at a becoming angle . He whistled gaily . It was satisfying to return to Chicago . The weather was pleasanter than it had been in Washington . After his trip Chicago seemed fresh and new , exhilarating . A block away , he saw Frank and Ellen coming toward him . He had timed things perfectly . He continued on at the same chipper pace . Ellen saw him . She waved her arms . He did not respond . He saw that she was getting more excited , and she was calling to him . He could hear his name now , and then a passing streetcar drowned out her voice for a moment . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling to him . He did n't change his pace . She was running toward him , and Frank trottedbehind her , a grin on his face . Ellen came to him and flung herself into his arms . " Ed , Ed , why did n't you telephone me ? When did you get back ? " Ed smiled mysteriously . " Ah , I apprehend you out with my best friend . " Frank grinned . " Ed ? " she said , startled , anxious . She looked to Frank and saw his grin . " Now I am beginning to understand , " she said . Ed smiled . " You 've grown more beautiful since I went away , " he told her . " Let me look at you . " " Well , I 'm not charging people this week to look at me . But I think I 'll begin to demand a fee next week . "
