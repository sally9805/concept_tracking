IN 1945 William Siegmund Schlamm ( Willi to the initiated ) , the Austrian-born writer-editor who had become one of Henry Robinson Luce 's closest advisers , wrote a widely circulated " confidential " memorandum outlining in some detail the proposed cultural monthly which he had been planning for Mr. Luce . The project would not aim for a mass circulation , Schlamm hinted ; it would , indeed , be " a magazine for grown-ups , " a characterization that for some reason he seemed to feel differentiated it from Time , Life , and Fortune . Moreover , Schlamm asserted , the magazine would " take art seriously , " would require only a minimal staff , " three editors , four assistants , three secretaries , and one office boy , " would on occasion allow " manly cussing " in its pages , and , while abhorring pomposity , would strongly support " good thinking , good writing , good manners . " There were many reasons for launching such a publication , Schlamm declared , among them the fact that " it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of journalism . " At that time Schlamm was not alone in expecting that , as soon as VI Day was out of the way , the great postwar " mutation " would begin . True , it had been a good many years since any important new magazine had been born , but by 1945 many of the leading publishing concerns had at least one , sometimes two or three projects in the planning stage . Young men who 'd never seen a linotype machine were dreaming about ? and trying to raise money for ? a half dozen other new magazines . But today , three years , millions of wasted dollars , and incalculable hours of unrecoverable time later , magazine reading habits in the United States ? with a single major exception ? remain virtually unchanged . Most of the proposed magazines never got beyond their protracted periods of gestation , and the reading public seemed remarkably cool to those that did . The reason for so numerous and so costly a series of failures make up one of the saddest and certainly strangest chapters in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than seven hundred magazines being published in this country . During the war everything that was printed had been bought and , as far as anybody knew , read . Magazine advertising had reached an all-time high ; manufacturers , even if they had nothing to sell , spent millions of dollars just to keep their company 's name before the public . ( Much of this expense was later written off in income taxes . ) Space salesmen who only a few years before had begged for every inch of advertising they received simply sat in their air-conditioned offices , doing their courteous best to discourage as many accounts as possible . Granted , there was n't enough paper for everybody , but publishers expected that shortage to end soon after the war . And there seemed to be an unprecedented chance to cash in on the new eagerness of subscribers and advertisers by launching new publications . In addition , publishers remembered what had happened in the previous postwar period of the twenties , when , with a minimum of cash and a maximum of editorial enterprise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wallace , and Harold Ross . Luce and the late Briton Hadden , after their graduation from Yale ( Class of 1920 ) , had concluded that most people were not well enough informed and decided that " something ought to be done . " With what in retrospect seems very little effort they raised $85,000 and launched the Weekly Newsmagazine ; in less than a year Time was selling 18,000 copies a week . DeWitt Wallace had had an even simpler idea ; with $600 in borrowed cash , $4,500 from eager charter subscribers , a basement room in Greenwich Village , a paste-pot , shears , and a pile of magazines from which articles were clipped for condensed reprinting , Wallace had launched the fantastically popular and profitable Reader 's Digest , And early in 1925 ex-Private Harold Ross , with only $20,000 of his own and an additional $25,000 from yeast-heir Raoul Fleischmann , had brought out the first issue of the New Yorker . Thus , during the war , a great many potential publishers and editors , some of whom later proved unable to distinguish between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duplicating the Ross-Wallace-Luce success story . During the first eighteen months after V-J Day more than two hundred new magazines were launched , most of them minor , including some with such intriguing titles as Pipe Smoker , Swank , Goofy Gags , Gals , and Whisper . Many were born quietly and inexpensively and expired a few months later . B UT the publishing giants worked more slowly . As early as 1943 , Curtis ( Saturday Evening Post , Ladies Home Journal , etc. ) had set up a commission to study the possibility of new postwar ventures ; Crowell-Collier ( Collier 's , American , etc. ) had its corporate eye on the international field ; the Cowles brothers , who after the phenomenal success of their Midwestern newspapers , had launched the equally successful Look , engaged a staff to work on a half-dozen ideas ; and even the executives of the Encyclopedia Britannica thought ( for a time ) that they sensed the need for something new in periodical journalism . But they all went ahead warily . One of the first to put actual cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ III , whose previous ventures into publishing had been with the Chicago Sun and the New York daily PM , both of which managed to stay in the red during many of the war years . Field set up what was known as Project X ( at one time in New York there were , in addition , a Magazine X , an Idea X , and two other Project X 's ) , and he chose as its editor Norman Cousins , the effervescent young editor of the Saturday Review of Literature , who was then also editing the Office of War Information 's multi-lingual pocket digest , U.S.A. Since the Field-Cousins project attempted to be the most closely-guarded secret of all , it quite naturally received the most publicity . Cousins started working on X early in 1945 and , within a month after the first news of its existence crept into the gossip columns , had received more than 9,000 applications for jobs , though none of the applicants had the slightest notion just what kind of magazine was planned , an ignorance just then shared , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editor . Eventually Cousins assembled a staff , and for more than two years after that a group which at one time numbered as many as fifteen full-time employees experimented with plans for a magazine that originally was to have competed in the four-color , slick-paper , mass-circulation weekly field dominated by the Saturday Evening Post and Collier 's . Like the concocters of other projects , Cousins ' staff spent a good deal of time in deep thought ; it was a period of eternal conference , of market surveys , of interviewing potential printers , of subtle inquiry of advertising agencies about available accounts , of pasting , assembling , and photostatting uncirculated dummy magazines , and of trying to persuade writers to produce copy for an audience that never numbered more than fifty or so readers . When , early in 1947 , Field decided to abandon the project and concentrate most of his publishing dollars on the Sun , PM , Simon gc Schuster , Pocket Books , and Parade , he had spent more than a quarter of a million dollars on X. One printed dummy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $50,000 ; there had been half a dozen photostatted dummy issues , and budgets had been drawn up which showed that to put such a weekly on the market would , by the most optimistic estimate , drain $10,000000 from the Field fortune before a profit could be expected . In February 1947 E. L. de Golyer , a Texas oil man who is also a Phi Beta Kappa , invested $33,000 in the undertaking ( which was by then planned as a slick national monthly ) ; but in July the staff was dismissed , Cousins to return full-time to the Saturday Review , a surprising number of the others to take jobs on other unpublished magazine projects . II T THE moment there is quite a good-sized colony in New York whose members make a reasonably respectable profession out of working on unborn magazines . One art director has taken part in five such undertakings , a pastime he now contemptuously dismisses as " playing magazine . " One editor has been in an executive position on three ; and one researcher has been involved with two and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only reached the chart stage . Obviously such an article as this can deal with only a handful of them . Every such venture starts out with a chart , usually an expensive , multi-color , beautifully lettered , heavy series of pasteboards complete with graphs and accompanied by explanatory prose , to be shown to prospective investors . Occasionally , the prose is heavy with irrefutable clich ? s such as " A magazine must have both readers and ? preferably ? advertising to he successful , " or " A good magazine ought to be readable . " One such exhibit made the frank admission that " it will take a little while for subscribers to understand just what ? is all about . " The Curtis Magazine X started out with typical ? clat . An office was rented in Rockefeller Center ; at one time twenty-seven full-time employees were on the staff , some of whom were sent to tour the high spots of Europe ; a ticker in the office gave the proceedings the urgency of a metropolitan newspaper with hourly editions , and about $375 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely ? and probably permanently ? on ice . Curtis had in mind what Time once dismissed as a " Life-like magazine " ? a picture weekly that was to have competed with Mr. Luce 's publication . Just how the Curtis Magazine X was to have differed from Life never seemed quite clear , except that there was some talk of it being " liberal , in a New Deal kind of way , " and one of the suggested titles was People . " We were going to concentrate on just folks , " one of the former editors once explained , " though what the hell else Life concentrates on , I never did know . Things , maybe ? " Ted Patrick , a highly successful advertising executive , headed up X for a while , but then was summoned to Independence Square in Philadelphia to take over as editor of Holiday , another Curtis publication and the one postwar magazine that has attracted a mass audience . Holiday , a lavish , handsome , four-color monthly that sells for fifty cents a copy , got off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a few uninspired issues , Patrick and his largely new staff brightened the format . Curtis for a while continued to take sizable ( but unannounced ) losses , but now the magazine has a circulation of about 800,000 . One of Holiday 's current editors has summed up its experience to date by saying , " There are n't more than two or three publishing houses that could afford such an expensive success . " The corporation has come a long way since Cyrus H. K. Curtis in 1898 purchased the almost defunct Saturday Evening Post for $1,000 , and the men at Independence Square have good reason to know that an expensive youth can be translated into a profitable maturity ; in the early days Curtis and his editor , George Horace Lorimer , spent every last available penny to push the Post up to the heights of prosperity . The extensive postwar plans of the Cowles brothers , directed by a former New York University professor and Rhodes scholar , Harlan Logan . included a slightly larger-thanpocket-size picture digest , which flirted with the title U.S.A. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ; as well as a small-circulation , expensively colorful technical magazine for the hundreds of thousands of camera enthusiasts in this country ( this was Project r . But after three dummies of X and a year of more study of Y ( things get a little complicated here ) , John and Gardner CoWles decided to stick to the newspaper business and Look . The Crowell-Collier project not only had several dummies ; it had a name , Victory . During the war , Ken Purdy , a graduate of M. L. Annenberg 's Click and Look , edited Victory for the OWI. a nine-language picture hi-monthly which had a non-black-market sale price of the equivalent of a dime ( although at one time it cost about eight dollars on the black market in Egypt ) . Eventually , this government magazine achieved a circulation of a million , which , on the surface at least , made it seem an attractive commercial venture . So after leaving the OWI , Purdy ( now editor of the Sunday supplement , Parade ) issued under the sponsorship of Crowell-Collier a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine , approximately Life-size , was to have been printed in what Purdy calls " all the obvious countries , " carrying both American and foreign advertising in its various editions , and was to have been produced with the co-operation of foreign publishers . Purdy resigned while the project was still in the planning stage . Shortly after a lavish dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria late last year , for which the Crowell Company picked up the tab for the foreign publishers who were the guests , the Victory project was placed on a dark corner shelf , and Crowell-Collier bravely swallowed its losses , including those of a memorable evening at the extravagant " Twenty-One " restaurant for which , to mellow an Indian publisher , non-alcoholic pineapple vinegar had been flown direct from Honolulu . T TIE Schlamm. - Luce idea was far less com- plex . When it was abandoned early this year , Schlamm had already spent more than thirty-six months working on the proposal . The staff , in accordance with the Schlamm memorandum , was tiny ; it included on occasion John Chamberlain , who before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Life 's highest paid writers , used to be the book critic for Harper 's , - Russell Davenport , who has helped edit and has written for all the Lucemagazines except Architectural Forum ( Davenport was also one of the late Wendell Willkie 's closest and earliest advisers ) ; T. S. Matthews , Time 's managing editor and a former New Republic editor , who was an occasional adviser of the project ; and Schlamm , who at sixteen was an Austrian Communist leader , then an anti-Communist leftist , and is still an anti-Communist . What Schlamm had in mind would have been Luce 's first non-popular ( not to be confused with unpopular ) magazine . Dwight MacDonald , a dissident former Luce employee and fellow Yale man who now edits a minor monthly called politics , harshly characterized the undertaking in his own publication as " an anti-cultural cultural magazine . " A sympathetic non-editorial observer of the project described it as " a magazine that would keep its shirt on . " It would , he said , have launched no crusades , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly and effectively , " have tried to kindle the rebirth of the essay , would have discussed aesthetics , art , religion , philosophy , and ideas in a manner that could not possibly have been appreciated by more than a small audience . There was at times some doubt as to just how large that audience would be ; at the beginning of the project , Schlamm seemed to feel that 50,000 was the maximum , but , toward the end , an audience of 200,000 " opinion makers " was being discussed . A number of famous foreign contributors had written for the unpublished dummies , including Lin Yutang , the Andres Gide and Malraux , and American intellectuals like Lionel Trilling and Reinhold Neibuhr , who also composes for Life on occasion . One problem , although minor , was to convince advertisers that Luce did n't have another Life on his hands and that only a few ads of a very special kind were desired . " We wanted to have a lean and hungry look , " one employee explained . ( In its early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of dollars were lost before Luce could raise his advertising rates sufficiently to carry the circulation ) . There was difficulty , too , in finding the right kind of material . Fiction , for example . After a year or more of looking at possible fiction selections , one staff member concluded that nobody was writing any decent short stories any more , up to and including Ernest Hemingway . In any case Davenport , Chamberlain , and Schlamm , who considered calling their project Measure , have now returned to other parts of the Luce forest , and the proposed magazine is in a state of what is probably permanent suspension . III A FEW proposed publications have , by what were surely a series of minor miracles , already made the frightening leap from planning to publication . Others , later arrivals in the field , have not been abandoned and are still in the photostating and money-raising stages . Jerome Ellison , a one-time novelist who had also been an associate editor of Reader 's Digest , managing editor of Liberty and Collier 's , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least as to sponsorship It is well known in publishing circles that almost all writers consider almost all editors persons of sub-normal intelligence whose greatest joy is removing the color and beauty from writers ' prose . Thus , Ellison reasoned that there must surely be a number of well-heeled writers , photographers , artists , and cartoonists who , weary of being frustrated by editors , would invest good money to publish a magazine which they themselves would own . He was right . By late 1946 some 380 of them , one or two investing as much as $5,000 , had contributed more than $400,000 to insure the publication of ' 47 ( the title was to change every twelve months ) The Magazine of the Year . The idea was also attractive to some 90,000 charter subscribers who sent in their money without seeing . an issue of the magazine , compared with the 4,500 charter subscribers of the Digest , 12,000 for Time , and 3,000 for the New Yorker . Almost 400,000 copies of the first issue of the magazine , dated March 1947 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . By May only 224,000 copies were bought , by July only 118,000 . Ellison resigned in May 1947 . While the idea for financing ' 47 was original , the editorial idea seemed somewhat vague . Physically , the publication looked like a rather more intellectual and liberal version of Coronet , and , except in size , and price ( it cost 35 cents a copy ) , ' 47 did not seem very different from a number of other magazines . Then , too , the owner-contributors did n't always send their best material to their own publication ; much of that continued to go to the higher-paying markets . Thus , a good measure of ' 47 's content seemed to have been dug up from the owner-contributors ' trunks . Finally , readers generally did n't seem to care who owned the magazine as long as it was interesting , but , through extremely clever and extremely expensive pre-publication promotion , ' 47 had managed to sound much more exciting than it proved to be . After Ellison left , a board of editors which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Out of China ) Jacoby , and the artist George Biddle took over . While the format and content were brightened considerably , the number of new cash customers was not large . In September the money-raising started again . But , although people like Bob Hope and Fred Allen ( neither of whom thought they 'd have much time actually to write for the magazine ) got together $100,000 to match a second $100,000 from . Mrs. Marshall Field HI and James P. Warburg , the banker-turned-writer , the troubles continued . Richard Lauterbach , a former senior editor of Life , took over as editor last winter and in March 1948 produced his first issue , much of the material in which did not come from owner-contributors . The circulation increased again ? but not enough ; and in June ' 48 was suspended . The till was empty , and the more than $1,000,000 necessary to re-launch the magazine in a larger , livelier format was not easy to find . O NCE a former Fortune editor reported that he 'd tried to start an LAA ? Luce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't find a large enough meeting hall , he said . The witticism became almost credible to those who noted how many cxLucers were engaged in launching new magazine projects . In addition to those already mentioned here , Gerard Piel and Dennis Flanagan ( both former science editors of Life ) and Leon Svirsky ( a former Time editor ) got together to plan still another new publication . They wanted to explain rather than report the news of science , and , for a while , toyed with the notion of bringing out a limited ( limited to a potential audience of 100 , 000. they hoped ) new monthly to be called The Sciences . But when Piel heard of the availability of the 103-year-old , half-forgotten Scientific American , he and his associates snapped it up , with the financial aid of investors like Bernard Baruch , the former Roosevelt adviser lsador Lubin , Gerard Swope of the General Electric , and John Hay Whitney . The first issue of the new and revitalized Scientific American appeared in May , written in prose that most college graduates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid both chemistry and physics . But it 's too early to decide whether there are enough customers and advertisers to make the magazine a profitable undertaking . McGraw-Hill 's new Science Illustrated is written in a more popular style but is neither so authoritative nor so thorough and aims for a far less professional audience . Mr. Whitney is also an investor in the United Nations World , a monthly that was born by combining such hardly mass media as Asia , Free World , and Inter-American . Since its first issue more than two years ago , the U. N. World has spent much of its time trying to five down the idea that it 's a house organ for the organization now housed at Lake Success . Twice since its inauguration the founders , headed by publisher Egbert White , a former advertising executive , have had to raise new cash , and the magazine is still swimming upstream . Nevertheless , there are plans for a United Nations World in England , as well as , a little more vaguely , several on the Continent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ..... NONE of the literary critics has been quite able to make up his mind whether the most recent war has as yet revealed its Hemingway , its Dos Passos , its F. Scott Fitzgerald ; and the magazine business is in somewhat the same position . As yet the leadership of Messrs . Luce , Wallace , and Ross seems unchallenged , but there are a few young men tapping their feet in the wings , eager ( a little too eager ) to walk on the stage and launch publications that they feel will make the success of their predecessors look like small and extremely cold potatoes . Julian Bach , Jr. , who thinks he has found a new editorial area and is , in addition , absolutely the last former Life editor to be mentioned in this article , a little more than a year ago opened up the high-sounding , as yet experimental Generation Press ( named because of Bach 's intense belief that his generation will have its own magazines ) and , along with Sidney Carroll , of Esquire Magazine , started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After tinkering with the title Showcase , Carroll and Bach tentatively settled on Carousel as the title of a new magazine which , to the eye at least , is the handsomest and most lavish of all the projects . H it is published , Carousel , which will concentrate on American culture , entertainment , and fashion , should appeal to somewhat the same audience as the late ( and often lamented ) Vanity Fair . The plan is to issue it bi-monthly , charge fifty cents a copy , and offer the customer approximately 130 pages of expansively colorful editorial matter . For example , a dummy issue includes a profile of Charles Jackson , profusely illustrated with photographs from Jackson 's own album ( one of which shows the author at a time when he might have been living through The Lost Weekend ) ; an insert of the first chapter of an unpublished new novel , printed on book-paper stock and with its pages the same size as the book itself ; an entire section of full-color paintings ; a picture story showing a great moment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ; a reprint of the famous Fred Allen ? Tallulah Bankhead satire of the husband-and-wife breakfast broadcasts ; plus an article by the actor James Mason on what he thinks of American women , a short story by an unkniown writer , and a short story by a very famous writer . Bach 's charts and surveys and studies point to a six-figure audience for his magazine as well as an impressive market for advertisers . After his first dummy is printed , he and his colleagues ( at the moment housed in an apartment on upper Park Avenue ) will get down to the final , and most important , step before publication . They will try to raise the $600,000 needed to get Carousel published . The Ambassador Publishing Company was named for slightly less austere reasons than the Generation Press ; the man who dreamed up the idea was staying at the Hotel Ambassador East in Chicago when the project got under way . That was early in 1946 ; since then . John and Carl Hess . two brothers from Chicago who are the editor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some 15,000 newspaper columnists and feature writers in this country are producing prose that is durable enough to interest , when properly presented , a million or so readers of a smooth paper hi-weekly magazine . In addition to a practice dummy , one complete issue of Column has been produced , and at the moment is being tested in a number of scientifically selected cities . ( The sample issue includes a round-up feature on prison life , a highly expert and many-sided discussion of Russo-American difficulties , a look at the state of boxing , the columnists ' feelings about the Democratic party , and several pages aptly titled ' Gossip . " ) If Column 's test uncovers an eager audience , the Hess Brothers , both of whom are new to the magazine field , will still have ahead of them the scarcely minor job of raising most of the kind of seven-figure money that is needed to get a mass magazine on the newsstands . Wallace Carroll , a one-time United Press correspondent who was also an OW1 executive , has one clear advantage over both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Max Ascoli , a naturalized Italian intellectual who married into the Rosenwald fortune . Ascoli will foot the bills of the unnamed Carroll magazine . Although its editors are reticent about the fact , the Carroll project was originally inspired by the enviably influential , beautifully written , thoughtful , but small-circulation London Economist . Carroll and his editors hope to combine all the advantages of the Economist and still obtain a more impressive circulation . Edited out of Washington , the magazine is scheduled to be published on smooth paper and is designed to report the why 's and meanings of the news rather than the events themselves . Originally , the publication date was set for the spring of this year , but now the project , once identified simply as A.B.C. , is scheduled to come out of hiding after the election . " But you never know , " said a one-time editor of the project , who has watched two other magazines wither from under him . " Maybe you ca n't start a new magazine any more . Probably has something to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the atomic bomb , the reasons why so many of the new magazines have failed ? and so many others found themselves unable to be born at all ? are neither very secret nor very difficult to understand . in the realm of ideas , nothing basically new has come along . When Luce first published Time , the only weekly even remotely in the same field was the senescent Literary Digest . Others had failed , but Luce was ready ( and able ) to demonstrate that what had been supposed to be a publishing graveyard was an excellent building site ; all you needed to do was to he lively and , always , individual- , something that the dead weeklies had not been able to do . Life was the first major effort in this country to produce a magazine edited on the sound thesis that most people would rather look at large pictures than read small type . Some publishers thought DeWitt Wallace was mad when he assured them that people would pay to read , in digested form , what already had appeared in their pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denied that the idea was original ? or , after the Digest got under way , that Wallace was an editor who knew what people wanted to read . And while the old Life and Judge were halfheartedly trying to remain national humor weeklies , Harold Ross was in no sense poaching when he confined himself to the mainly humorous foibles of the then seven million inhabitants of New York City and simultaneously developed a vein of humor previously unworked in the United States . But too many of the projects following this war did not involve new ideas at all ; their promoters simply wanted to take another crack at a job that was already being done . In the case of the Field project , the formula was primarily the same as that of Collier 's and the Post ; Norman Cousins thought he could produce a more sprightly and liberal magazine , but editorially the format was not original . Neither was that of the Curtis X , which proposed to improve on Life ; and Crowell-Collier would have tried , by a different publish . ing arrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition , ideas aside , the printing and paper costs of publishing a magazine have increased , in some cases as much as 100 to 150 per cent ( sometimes even higher for newcomers in the field ) since the twenties . Luce , although he had to return to his investors twice before Time was making a sure profit , needed only $85,000 to get under way , compared with the Field estimate of $10,000,000 , with the Curtis million-dollar experience with Holiday , and with an estimated even higher break-even point for People . Even established magazine publishers today shudder before entering negotiations for new printing and paper contracts . Then , too , the readership and advertising boom began to dwindle immediately after the war ended . Wartime reading habits did not continue ; when gas rationing ended , when men returned from overseas , when old amusements again opened up , the circulations of almost all magazines suffered . And with the end of wartime profits , it was no longer quite so easy for manufacturers to write off advertising expenses . Salesmen again had to grub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hundred advertisers who control most of the advertising dollars would rather spend their revenue with the sure bets than experiment with something new . Most advertising dollars go to the handful of magazines that dominate the mass-circulation field . Another difficulty has been the fact that too many potential publishers have been unwilling to start out on a small scale and grow ; they wanted to start at the top . In this regard , Gerard Piel with his modest Scientific American , which is aimed for a specific and small audience , is an exception . Finally , too , the amount of risk capital available these days is not large . During the twenties , a bright economic future seemed to stretch endlessly ahead , but now there are too many uncertainties , both domestically and internationally . Besides , the average millionaire ( and experienced money-raisers in the publishing field seldom bother with anyone less ) is likely to feel , and with some justification , that in no other field except the theater is it so difficult to estimate public reaction . One editor junked his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gustavus Myers ' A History of the Great American Fortunes . " Why , " he said , disgustedly tossing the book aside , " Those guys are all dead . " There will be new magazines , of course ; perhaps the exception to the current rule will be Carousel or Column or the Carroll project . Or possibly it will be a publishing idea that as yet has n't even reached the chart stage . It may even be one of the still struggling hand-full of new publications already on the newsstands but involved with circulation and advertising deficiencies . Or perhaps it is an antique dealer in St. Louis who has the most valid publishing idea for the forties . He has launched something called Neurotica , and , while disclaiming any neuroses of his own , he believes he will he able to find plenty of circulation , if only among his friends .
