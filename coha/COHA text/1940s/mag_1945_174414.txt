Rain fell , a sleety , chilling March drizzle . Up the green slopes of Arlington Cemetery rolled a black limousine . On a roadway near a freshly dug grave it stopped . Inside , Franklin Roosevelt leaned back against the beige upholstery and looked out on a dismal scene . They were burying big , bluff " Pa " Watson , the man whose boisterous laugh and high good humor had never failed to cheer the President . If Franklin Roosevelt 's lean , set face showed any emotion , no one could record it . The rain streaming down the windows curtained the man within . He was left to himself , and his thoughts . <P> Such was the homecoming from Yalta . <P> On the long voyage home Franklin Roosevelt , sunning himself on the cruiser 's deck , had made a decision to report to Congress on Yalta , in person and as soon as possible . Except for the blow of Pa Watson 's death , he had returned from the Crimea refreshed in body , mind and spirit . Thirty-six hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> It was his first appearance there in 26 months . The gallery was packed . Ranking diplomats were there and Administration bigwigs ; in front-row gallery seats sat Eleanor Roosevelt and Daughter Anna , notepaper in hand . The floor , too , was filled : Representatives ( some holding youngsters in their laps ) , Senators and all the Cabinet except Secretaries Stettinius and Forrestal , who were out of the country . <P> Franklin Roosevelt had made another decision : to leave his leg braces at home . There was a momentary hush as he came into the chamber in an armless wheelchair . Then there was an ovation . The President slipped into a red plush chair in the well of the House , behind a table lined with a dozen microphones . As the flashbulbs popped and newsreels ground , he turned to wave to Vice President Truman and House Majority Leader McCormack on the dais . <P> Ten Pounds of Steel . He began by frankly noting what everyone had wondered about : " I hope you Will pardon me for the unusual posture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will realize it makes it a lot easier for me in not having to carry about ten pounds of steel around the bottom of my legs and also because of the fact that I have just completed a 14,000-mile trip . " <P> The audience applauded , and it laughed and applauded again when he said " I was not ill for a second on my trip until I arrived back in Washington and heard all the rumors . . . . The Roosevelts are not , as you may suspect , averse to travel . " <P> Thus Franklin Roosevelt set the tone for what may come to be one of the most historic speeches of his career . It was a confidential , informal speech , all but devoid of the ringing Roosevelt oratorical tone . There was none of the usual recrimination , reprimand or warning . In his studied informality , the President departed often from his prepared text ( 49 times for a total of 700 words ) . <P> It was not a great speech . Franklin Roosevelt revealed almost nothing which had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterward , or by Winston Churchill in his report to the House of Commons ( see FOREIGN NEWS ) . Going into the chamber , the President had said : " I hope to do in one hour what Winston did in two . "
