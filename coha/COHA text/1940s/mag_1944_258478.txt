The smoking little flame wavered higher up the side of the cavernous tent in the big lot at Hartford , Conn . The thousands of women and their children , and the scattering of coatless men massed in the bleachers , sat quietly , second after second , watching the high-wire performers of Ringling Brothers and Barnum &; Bailey 's Greatest Show On Earth . They breathed the circus smells of peanuts and tigers , in the hot afternoon air , and listened to the thumping circus music . Some of them watched the harmless-looking little fire crawling up the canvas . <P> Then the flame suddenly spurted upward with nightmare swiftness , and billowed silently across the whole top of the tent near the main entrance . The bleachers suddenly rumbled under thousands of feet ; folding chairs clattered and banged . The crowd struggled to reach the ground , flowed wildly toward the exits , clotted into groups which pushed and elbowed with silent , furious concentration in the furnace-like heat . Men &; women in the high bleacher seats began dropping children to the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canvas fell . Women screamed as their hair and dresses caught fire . Then a tent pole toppled soundlessly , trailed by burning canvas . People were still struggling down from their seats . <P> Three minutes had passed . <P> Disaster March . There still was brassy music . The band , on their feet at the unburned end of the tent , jerkily pumped out The Stars and Stripes Forever , as a " Disaster march , " the traditional circus warning to performers outside the tent to rally round for trouble . The aerialists slid down their ropes , began tumbling acrobatically toward safety . <P> A mass of the crowd headed toward the performers ' exits near the band . Hundreds of them jammed up against the barred runway through which the last leopards from the animal acts were still slinking toward outside cages . As the people struggled here , some scrambling over , some lifting small children , some trampling wildly , the fire raced toward them along the collapsing canvas high overhead . The heavy tent poles fell quickly , one after another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on the crowd . There was a brief , screaming struggle beneath it . <P> The sooty bandsmen , now safe outside , began to play again . The street and the circus lot with its rows of red-painted wagons , the open lots lying beyond , were full of people watching the hotly burning wreckage . Past them wandered the burned and the weeping ; the frantic parents of children dead in the flames , the lost tots staring at strange faces , the dazed and blackened figures with singed hair and loose rags of clothing . <P> Six minutes had passed .
