Because Roman Catholics believe that theirs is the one &; only True Church , they are discouraged from attending heretical or schismatic religious services-i.e. , any but their own . Many Roman bishops restrain their priests , and refrain themselves , from joining interfaith gatherings , where their presence might seem to condone the heresy that one religion is as good as another . In the U. S. last year , Archbishop John Gregory Murray of St. Paul made an exception to this rule , when he preached a sermon at a men 's rally promoted by an Episcopalian . In New Haven , Conn , last Sunday night , a Catholic priest did likewise by appearing at Yale University on equal footing with a Protestant minister . <P> The Protestant was angular , deep-voiced , intense Dr. Richard Roberts . Presbyterian theologian and onetime moderator of the United Church of Canada . The Catholic was a famed convert , bespectacled , dynamic , firm-jawed Rev. William Edwin Orchard of London . To bring the two together for a series of four joint lectures , the sponsors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permission of Bishop Maurice Francis McAuliffe of Hartford ( in whose diocese New Haven lies ) , and Arthur Cardinal Kinsley of London , Father Orchard 's superior . <P> One of England 's great preachers , William Orchard was trained as a Presbyterian but attained fame as a liberal in a Congregational pulpit-King 's Weigh House Church in London 's West End . He , who once used to keep away from church at Easter because he had his doubts about the Resurrection , became increasingly Catholic . He instituted Mass , the Reserved Sacrament , the Benediction , bells , candles and incense in his Nonconformist church . When a well-fed parishioner demanded to know why , in Mass , he had been asked to worship " a bit of bread , " Dr. Orchard snapped : " Well , sir , we happen to agree with our Lord that it is His Body . But , judging by your looks , if I had elevated a five-shilling piece , you would have worshiped it fast enough . " Dr. Orchard became associated with a Society of Free Catholics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Syro-Nestorian Church . He finally entered the Church of Rome in 1932 . When he was ordained anew , in 1935 , he had but one regret : he found it difficult to " detest " his former faith , as required in the oath of abjuration . <P> Father Orchard and Presbyterian Roberts ( who was born in Wales ) became friends in England 35 years ago . Last Sunday each knew well the other 's mind when they mounted the platform of Yale 's Sprague Hall . Their subjects for the first lecture-the Existence of God for Father Orchard , the Nature of God for Dr. Roberts-were typical of the series . The Yale Christian Conference is neither a debate nor a revival , but a sober discussion for a mature audience . Its recent course has been cheering to churchmen searchingfor signs of a U. S. religious revival . In the ' 20s , attendance dwindled : the conferences were abandoned when only 150 people turned out to hear Sherwood Eddy in 1926 . When they were begun again last year , 800 went to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite the fact that it took place on a winter Sunday , drew 500.
