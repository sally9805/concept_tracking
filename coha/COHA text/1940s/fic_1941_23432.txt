THE DEAR LITTLE DOVES A STORY BY ELEANOR GREEN I N THE cooldarkness of her room the little girls ' mother lay dreaming , the wonderful quiet of the country slowly widening out as she wakened . Not a sound but the afternoon breeze in the old trees and , far away across the green fields , the bark of a dog . She was in no hurry to get up ; it was very hot and in the summer stillness beyond the drawn curtains the heat was germinating trouble : the cattle in the pastures felt it and drew together , and the green-silver cornstalks wilted in the sun . There was sure to be a storm . Crosswise of the bed , her black hair spread fanwise over the cool pillow , she lay without moving , lay listening . Not a sound , not even the breeze now , not a breath of air . And no sound from the children ; where could they be ? Rising , she eros ed the room , the hem of her pale chiffon neglig6e catching on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over it , her satin slippers sinking deep as in moss . From the window that looked out over the lawn she saw the two little girls , in their blueand-white gingham dresses , kneeling before a large packing box , their long hair touching the grass as they bent their heads to see into the wire-covered slit where one board had been removed . In the shade of the summer trees their bright eyes saw two other pairs of eyes , black , tiny , and unblinking , which seemed to scrutinize their wondering faces with quizzical interest . On both sides of thewire there was timidity if not alarm , for the sharp eyes within the box saw figures many times their own size while the little girls saw gleaming pinpoints and pointed beaks whose quick snapping could badly hurt a little girl 's inquisitive finger . On the floor of the box sharp bird claws drily clicked , like their mother 's long nails on the piano keys , and to this sound and the soft sobbing inbreath of the birds the little girls listened without even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mother asked of herself as she brushed out her straight shining hair . Standing at the open window , she watched them while she twisted her hair into a soft knot and stuck the bone hairpins in with the quick twist of the wrist which the children so loved to see . They seemed so far away , so curious , kneeling under the trees , Tillie 's stiff blonde braids swinging against Dora 's softly curling dark hair . She wished she could feel as Mark felt about them , but to her they were simply the children , very sweet children , to be sure , and , thank heaven , very pretty ; but Mark was an idiot , talking about the pure perfection of their minds . Innocent , yes , though not for long ; but mental perfection ? Why , the babies hardly knew how to talk ! No , that was the doting father , the almost sickening paternal pride . It was really a good thing that she was n't like that ; one in the family was enough . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young to be anything but innocent . Sighing , she turned from the window to the looking glass . " You 're getting old , Natalie , " she said to her image , and massaged the little lines round her eyes once or twice ; then , fastening a silver chain round her throat , she stepped back to survey herself , tall and willowy in her pale-yellow dress . As she walked from her room through the quiet house it was with the peculiar gait of a woman who , lacking better , is her own audience . What she had expected to find in the wooden crate she did n't quite know  --  some child 's makebelieve , at best : a bundle of grass with an empty nest , or perhaps a firefly under a tumbler ; certainly not two gentle slate-gray pigeons comfortingly cooing to each other . She could not discover how they had come ; the children knew only that when they wakened from their nap the birds were there , and Nellie had left them to keep watch while she went in search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort . Ned could probably fix up something , she had said , he being so handy . She should know , she said to herself , feeling the vague sense of nausea which she always felt when thinking of what must pass for love among her servants , oblivious of the fact that , for all her milk-white skin , her dove-gray eyes , her handsome body , Ned , the hired man , had more than once expressed himself on the undesirability of her as a woman . " No heart , " he would say . " Like going to bed with a puppet . " But Nellie was right : Ned had fixed up something , " in just a jiffy , " and up from the shop the two of them came laughing , carrying the cumbersome thing between them . It was Iike an enormous wire mesh cake cover , or a bell in which the birds would be the gentle clackers . " No bottom , " said Ned , " so they can be on the grass , else they 'll get sores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around from spot to spot , so 's they cin git clean grass when they need it . " Now he really need n't have added that , Natalie thought . Especially before the children . But the children appearedeither to take it as a sensible idea or to ignore it completely . Tillie , her hands clasped tight , stood by in speechless rapture , while Dora , still kneeling , pressed her cheek against the chicken wire and whispered " Coo . . . coo . . . . " The birds , transferred into their larger cage , walked about on the matted grass , their sleek heads pushing in and out with each step , the metallic green-and-rosy ruff round their necks puffed out , their straight wing feathers hugging their beautiful curving bodies , and as they walked they trilled a soft staccato , half purr , half sob , and twisted their quaint heads until one eye looked straight up into heaven , from which darling sight they had so long been shut off . Never had the little girls loved anything so much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent on imported dolls and expensive , brightly decorated toys . Queer , their liking these really fairly stupid , dull gray birds ? children were supposed to be attracted by brilliant colors . Well , further proof of the unpredictability of the small child . Perfection of their minds indeed ! Mark was crazy , that was all . The trouble was he was n't with them all day long as she so often was . Interesting of course , and sweet , but terribly unsatisfying in the long run ; so unresponsive , so self-centered , so terribly reticent . Nevertheless she was a little jealous of Mark for thinking of sending this so acceptable gift . Mark had not sent the birds , however . Dora , still adoring on her dimpled knees , saw something tied to one of the pigeons ' wings , and Ned was summoned to untie it a little parchment note , which he handed silently to Natalie . " What does it say ? " the children asked together , their excitement reaching a new pitch , their eyes now almost fever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Read it , Mother , what does it say ? Oh tell us , tell us ! Daddy sent them , did n't he , Mother ? They 're from Daddy , are n't they ? Oh , goodie , Daddy sent them ! " " Yes , Daddy sent them , " said Natalie , crumpling the note in her suddenly hot palm as she walked off toward the house , her face noticeably flushed . " Daddy my eye ! " said Ned under his breath , and Nellie raising one eyebrow , nodded . How utterly romantic ! Natalie thought as she reread the note in her restful room . How foolish and how romantic ! Of course she would have to make up something to tell Mark when he came up for the week-end , and that was too bad , and really awfully silly , awfully , because Hal meant practically nothing to her really ; he was just a child , after all , he was a good ten years younger than she , just out of college . Hal and Mark had so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course could never see it . Nor for that matter could Hal . But there was no use stirring up trouble ; she 'd say that her father had sent them . And besides , he might ; that is , it was the sort of thing her father might do . Now her father and Hal  --  well , sometime she 'd take Hal to call on him if ever she got the chance . Oh , but that would n't do , telling Mark her father had sent them ! She 'd already told the children their daddy had sent them , and they 'd thank him first thing ; they 'd climb up into his lap and put their arms round his neck , Dora on the left , Tillie on the right , and they 'd whisper how much they loved their little birds . For a moment Natalie was just barely frightened , but then she laughed as the perfect solution offered itself : she would tell him that she had sent them but  --  and here was the real stroke of genius  --  she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent them and had seemed so to want the birds to come from him and nobody else that she did n't have the heart to disappoint them , and had said , yes , that Daddy had sent them . And then Mark could be jealous ! What was more , he would think she 'd been extremely generous to allow the children to think he 'd done it , and , being sorry he had n't , as well as grateful that they thought he had , he would do almost anything to please her . Something subtle , of course . No mention of gifts or anything of the sort , but he might , just this once , give up hearing the children 's prayers to take her  --  oh , almost anywhere . Yes , it was the perfect solution , it was really a work of art . Sitting alone at her satiny dining-room table , the lighted white candles in their tall silver sticks unflickering in the breathless air , Natalie watched the children as they ate their supper  --  as they had begged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The birds , in the deep green shade , took the bits of peanut-butter sandwich so eagerly offered them , and strutted noiselessly about in the hushy grass . Subdued by the wonder of their little eyes , their little feet , their shining downy breasts , the children whispered together , fearful of frightening the birds with the sound of their own birdlike voices . They were altogether happy . It was a sweet thing for Hal to have done , Natalie was thinking . Foolish , to be sure , and emotionally extravagant and absurd , but really very dear . And it had done her so much good , which she would never be able to make Mark understand . It had set her up , it had given back to her some of the secretive excitement and plain physical pride which she had felt when she was , say , ten years younger , and which was so important to any woman . Yes , it was a dear thing for Hal to have done , he was a dear boy , a foolish , quite absurd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How beautiful she was in that light , her dark head against the tall carved back of her chair , her bare arms outstretched along the table , the candlelight on the pale surface of the candlesticks and spoons , on the gleaming rosewood table , on the mystery of her shining woman 's hair . The white skin , dark arched brows , half-closed heavy-lidded eyes  --  how beautiful she was , watching her cherubs playing in the evening shade . And as she tinkled the little silver bell how beautiful she felt ! From the earth 's curving crest thunder began to roll . The sky darkened with heavy clouds , the leaves hung limp on every tree . Nothing stirred . Only the children , fearless in their love , ran about in the yard picking white clover which they dropped through the wires on to the pigeon-patted grass , and as the wind came up they chased the whirling leaves , racing together when their mother called them into the house . There was no time to move the birds before the full splendor of the storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand at the closed window , their arms about each other 's waists , shuddering as the lightning flicked the sky wide open , and when the black rumbling bails of thunder rolled across the echoing floor of heaven they pressed their soft , fragrant bodies close together , so like the pigeons which each flash of light illumined in their ruffled , unblinking fright . The wind rose to a gale and the house could be felt to give as the wind boomed down around it and banged the shutters on their hinges . When the rain began to fall it came like pellets of lead , beating the very trees back into the earth and flattening the pigeons against the grass . Thunder and lightning were inseparable , so close to the house was the storm 's raging core , and Natalie was deafened at the same instant that her eyeballs seemed seared and shrivelled in her head . " I 'm no good in a storm , " she thought , walking up and down through the house . " I should n't let the children know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And as her high heels came down with each quick step , Hal 's eloquent face , in the silver locket , bobbed , blindly smiling , against her beautiful white bosom . When the storm abated it was late dusk . The sand in the roadway was pounded hard , supporting little pools of water where the receding storm clouds were darkly mirrored , and at last the children were allowed out , to run barefoot through the wet grass , their ankles ringed round with bracelets of cool drops . Shouting in the electric air , they frightened the birds , which flew against the cage , one of them catching a wing in the fine wire mesh . The little girls , hushed with distress , tried to release it , but the frightened bird pecked at their fingers and beat its other wing so terribly that they could do nothing , so at last Tillie , in tears , tipped up the cage for Dora to climb under in order to free the bird from the inside . But as she raised it the other bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the doorway , Natalie saw the little girls in the summer gloam : a bizarre sight , with dear little Dora caught in the wire cage and Tillie with her arms raised , praying to the bird to come back . " How perfectly absurd children are , " she said , her hand on her silver locket , and , leaning against the door frame , dared to laugh at her two small passionate daughters . From the irate sky an arrow of light shot through the trees , and Tillie 's little supplicating heart was still . The solitary pigeon rose above the treetops and was lost against the shining armor of the western sky , and the spreading light , like ice , sharpened the edge of every mortal thing . The air was purified , as by the passage of a saintly person .
