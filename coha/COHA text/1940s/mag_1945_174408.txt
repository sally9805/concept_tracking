One of Detroit 's citizens stepped up to the microphone one night last week and told how he had " hit bottom " as an alcoholic . To underline his confession , some of the more melodramatic and sordid aspects of his past were dramatized . Then he told of his regeneration . Summed up the announcer : " Alcoholism is a disease . . . an obsession . . . an allergy . . . . " <P> The man who " hit bottom " was the first in a parade of anonymous Detroiters who will describe their alcoholic pasts over WWJ every other Saturday ( 11:15-11:30 p.m. , E.W.T. ) . The series is the first sustained air flight of the famed organization called " Alcoholics Anonymous " ( TIME , Oct. 23 ) . <P> Detroit A.A.s give credit for the broadcast project to 62-year-old William Edmund Scripps , big boss of the Detroit News and WWJ . He was so impressed by A.A. 's reformation of a drunkard friend that he decided to do what he could to boost the organization 's Detroit membership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
