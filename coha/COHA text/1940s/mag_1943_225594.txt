Ted Lewis , the Pied Piper of Happiness , Ol ' Man Sunshine , the Medicine Man for Your Blues , the High-hatted Tragedian of Song , was back in town . A quarter of a century had passed , and incredibly , the old show was still going on . Among the bamboos and potted palms of Manhattan 's Hurricane restaurant , he cocked his shabby topper over his ancient and leering eye and abandoned himself to his 1920 classic When My Baby Smiles at Me . <P> He played the clarinet , if possible , more terribly than ever . He went on through his hoarse , posturing , theatrical repertory of songs . ( Said one delighted onlooker : " He has to be seen to be heard . " ) He asked if everybody was happy . And everybody was . <P> Ted Lewis has the most durable act in U.S. show business . In 25 years he has never changed his manner , and very little of his matter . Yet despite the fact that the few movies in which he has appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warily avoided radio contracts , he and his company can still pull an average of $7,500 weekly out of U.S. theaters and nightspots from coast to coast . Ted Lewis has survived the death of vaudeville , the invention of sound film , the development of modern broadcasting . And he is still packing them in . <P> The reason is not Lewis ' music per se . His band has at times had first-class hot-jazz players ( Muggsy Spanier , Benny Goodman , Jimmy Dorsey , George Brunies* ) . But usually the musicians are purely a supporting cast to Lewis himself . He is a one-man synthesis of U.S. show business at its showiest . Under full steam , Ted Lewis embodies the Shakespearean ham , the minstrel strutter , the carnival drum major , the medicine barker , the vaudeville tearjerker , the circus buffoon , the ragtime sport-all among the most fondly regarded figures in U.S. life . <P> Ahead of the Bloodhounds . Theodore Leopold Friedman was born 52 years ago in Circleville , Ohio , took his present name while traveling with a singer named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading department store , Lewis ran away from home to join Dr. Cooper 's Herb Medicine Show as clarinet soloist . Later he led a parade of bloodhounds with the Gentry Brothers Dog and Pony Show . In 1917 he got a Manhattan job at Rector 's with Earl Fuller 's band . <P> This was a poor imitation of the sensational Original Dixieland Jazz Band , then making the word jazz famous . But after two years Lewis left Rector 's with a reputation for the musical clowning that has remained his stock in trade for a generation . It was on the curb outside Rector 's that he acquired the battered , furry top hat which W. C. Fields later taught him to twirl with uncanny virtuosity . Lewis won it in a crap game from the driver of a hansom . <P> You and You and You . Since those days , the story of Ted Lewis has been one of distribution rather than production . He has played the U.S. sticks from Wenatchee , Wash , to Portland , Me . His wife , who once cooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a massive West Side apartment in Manhattan and a 22-room house at Elberon , NJ . On the main road entering his home town of Circleville , the local Kiwanis Club has erected a conspicuous sign reading " Circleville , home of Ted Lewis . "
