txt Damage to State Guard Feared The New York Guard has been in operation for the past twenty months , during which time it has seen many of its soldiers drafted into the Army . Hundreds of these men have successfully risen in a few months to non-coms , which can be attributed to the excellent instruction given by the officers of the various Guard regiments . The recent news item concerning the drafting of 3-A men and the eventual drafting of the 18-19 class will , in all probability , cause the death of the Guard , since draft boards do not recognize the Guard . Those who will suffer most are the junior officers , who , after furnishing themselves with officer 's equipment out of their own pockets , must discard their bars , become buck privates for Uncle Sam and start at the bottom again . LAWRENCE NEwMAN , New York , Aug. 27 , 1942.
