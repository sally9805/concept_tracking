Hint For their benefit we might reprint a Christmas suggestion which has appeared in this column from time to time , though without visibly affecting the Yuletide habits of the American people . The general idea is that for Christmas inside the family the best gift a wife can buy her husband is a nice afternoon gown or skiing suit for herself . The best gift a husband can buy his wife is the choice briar pipe he has long had his eye on . The theory here is that the surest way to promote another person 's happiness is to start out by making yourself a pleasant person to live with . What better gift can a man ask than a handsome wife in a new fur coat ; or , vice versa , a good-looking husband in a new silk lounging robe ?

We mean books as gifts . Once a person has decided to give books or a book for Christmas there should be no trouble in deciding what book to give . Let a person give the book he is anxious to read himself but has never managed to get around to it . Let him state that fact in transmitting the gift .

Since then the Federal Government has gone into the red for another nine or ten billion dollars , which we figure out at roughly $80 per person , making the total per capita debt about $600 . We then multiply by four persons to a family , get $2,400 as the family debt , throw in another hundred dollars for sundries and contingencies , and get our total family debt of $2,500 . This is , of course , quite aside from the family 's private obligations . Is the average American Citizen family good for $2,500 of as public debt ? Well , we are Investor like the man in the saloon whose credit is good for a drink if he has had his drink . We have had our drink . We have borrowed the eighty billion dollars and are getting ready to borrow a good deal more ..
