Conversion , not reconversion , was the nation 's task-conversion to a one-front war . <P> In Germany , there was an end to foxhole life . But the captives and the war criminals were still coming in . The homeless trudged down the endless roads . The task of occupation had just begun , and many felt that the job ahead in Germany was just as important as the job concluded . <P> At home , reconversion had started ( see Transition ) , but the U.S. was still on a war economy . Only some of the froufrou had been restored . <P> The first handful of discharged soldiers returned to their homes , welcomed by families and friends , photographed by the press ( see ARMY &; NAVY ) . But eleven million were still in the armed forces and nine million of them would stay there . Other thousands would still be drafted . <P> Time &; Tonnage . The task of redeployment to the Pacific was staggering ( see BUSINESS ) . Now the Philippines would become the England of the war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not England . They were 1,900 miles away from Tokyo , and they had next to none of the necessary shipping facilities . <P> By best estimate , it would take six months to get the first U.S. ground troops from the European theater to the Pacific . <P> In the wait for strength , air power would get its second , and probably greatest , test . By last week the Army Air Forces had mined Tokyo harbor ( see WORLD BATTLEFRONTS ) , and stepped up the Superfortress fire attacks on Japan 's industry to 500-plane strength - equivalent in bomb tonnage to all but a few of the heaviest air strikes against Germany . The attacks would grow heavier . If there was anything left of Tokyo or Nagasaki or Nagoya or of any of Japan 's industrial plant by the time the U.S. Army and Marines moved in , it would not be through lack of attention from the Air Forces . <P> Policy &; Prospect . There had been a few faint peace feelers , but none to which Washington gave even fleeting thought . Unconditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hirohito , Son of Heaven ( see FOREIGN NEWS ) , as yet showed no signs of breaking . <P> No one doubted that Japan was as thoroughly beaten right now as Germany was last summer . Neither did anyone have any good reason to expect a quick decision .
