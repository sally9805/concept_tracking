txt DEADLOCK IN WEST CONTINUES TO BALK SEA STRIKE PEACE NMU and 39 Eastern Operators Delay Renewal of Parleys Pending Moves on Pacific ISSUES NEAR SETTLEMENT Executive Board of Unity Group to Meet Tomorrow With Murray in Capital By LAWRENCE RESNER A renewal of negotiations between the National Maritime Union , CIO , and thirty-nine Eastern operators to end the shipping strike was held up yesterday by a continued deadlock on the West Coast . All parties here agreed that the basic issues between them could be settled in short order , and Frederick R. Livingston , Federal conciliator , continued his efforts to bring them together . He had expected to arrange a joint meeting yesterday but this fell through when no word came from the West Coast of any change in the shipping companies ' refusal to meet with two striking West Coast unions until they return to work . The Committee for Maritime Unity announced , meanwhile , that its entire executive board would meet in Washington tomorrow morning with Philip Murray , president of the Congress of Industrial Organizations . The West Coast situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NMU , that J. B. Bryan , president of the Pacific American Shipowners Association , and " mysterious forces in high Government circles " were obstructing a quick end of the strike . He also charged that these " mysterious forces " were attempting to hold up an arbitration award by James L. Fly bearing on the I union 's effort to win pay parity with other maritime unions  --  the principal issue in the strike . However , Mr. Fly 's office said there was considerable mimeographing to be done and that an announcement on the award would be made at 10 o'clock this morning . Mr. Fly has indicated his belief in the necessity for the elimination of wage inequities in the industry and his award may prove the key to the settlement of the dispute . Arbitration for 3 Unions His arbitration proceedings covered three unions , two of which , the NMU and the Marine Cooks and Stewards of the Pacific Coast , also CIO , are directly involved in the strike . His award presumably would settle all points in dispute on wages between the NMU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Coast cooks . This would leave a single union , the Marine Firemen , Oilers , Watertenders and Wipers , independent , without a documented settlement of its wage clams , but in this case , too , Mr. Fly 's award may provide a solution through the wage scales specified for NMU firemen . In any event , most of the parties involved in the dispute were awaiting the Fly award as the possible answer to a swift settlement . In San Francisco 2,000 members of unions affiliated with the Committee for Maritime Unity , which is composed of the firemen and six CIO unions , staged a mass demonstration yesterday afternoon outside of the Pacific American Shipowners Association 's offices , A seven-man delegation , led by James Drury , port agent for the NMU , went upstairs to attempt to confer with Mr. Bryan , but was told by a receptionist that he was out to lunch . The delegates left a note for Mr. Bryan reading : " A committee of maritime unions was here to speak to you about your refusal to meet with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet with our committee and that there will be further delays in the settlement of this strike . This is a renewal of our demand of equal pay for equal work . " An employers ' spokesman said later that neither Mr. Bryan ' nor any other official was in when the unions called , but added , " however , our position remains the same . As soon as the unions fulfill their contracts and return to their ships we will meet with them . " ' The West Coast unions after their demonstration sent a telegram to Gov . Earl Warren of California asking him to prevail upon the shipowners to negotiate . The CMU expressed the belief that " only extreme public and ofContinued on Pago 26 , Column 3 SEA PEACE BALKED STILL BY DEADLOCK // ficial pressure will budge the shipowners and that you , as Chief Executive of the State , should lead Any possibility of separate setthat pressure . " tlements was ruled out again in a statement by Mr. Curran that the owners here were attempting to get the NMU to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Curran 's statement was interpreted as a rejection of a separate settlement even if the firemen or cooks offered to fight out the dispute by themselves . The strike by the NMU , firemen and cooks , which foHowed a strike by two American Federation of Labor maritime unions , was called to win comparable pay increases . The AFL unions had won increases of $27.50 and $22.50 monthly , compared to $17.50 granted the firemen and the two CIO unions . These problems have all but been eliminated , however , in negotiations or in the provisions expected in the Fly award , leaving the unions and the shipowners in the position of continuing a costly tieup on the basis of " principle . " The unions contend that it is the policy of the Committee for MariItime Unity to stand together in a situation like this , whereas the employers have taken the position that this is a fight against further " contract deterioration . " The employers refer to the fact that they have negotiated contracts that do not expire until June , 1947 . James Romanoff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Engineers Beneficial Association , CIO , disclosed that Mr. Murray had called the MEBA 's national executivd board to Washington for a meeting tomorrow morning to discuss the status of their negotiations . Six hundred members of Local 33 voted last night to send a telegram to President Truman asking his intervention in the maritime strike . The union named a strike committee to function in the event a walkout is called upon expiration of its contract with Atlantic , Gulf and Pacific Coast operators on Sept. 30 . Votes in a nation-wide strike poll among members of the union will be counted next Wednesday . A committee from Local 791 of the International Longshoremens Association , headed by James Joseph O'Connor , visited NMU headqaurters during the afternoon to learn the status of negotiations . Its members pointed out that they had been kept idle for a variety of reasons , the AFL maritime strike , the truck strike and now the CIO strike and asked , to be kept informed of what was happening . The Maritime Commission reported that ninety - seven ships were being worked by longshoremen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the James McCosh had sailed . This was the first American ship to leave the harbor since the AFL called the strike on Sept. 5 . The commission said 1,500 American vessels were in ports over the country yesterday , 918 along the Atlantic , of which 436 were in New York Harbor .
