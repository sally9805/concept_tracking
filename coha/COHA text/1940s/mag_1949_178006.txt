In the world of commodity markets , where millions of eggs are traded every day , few traders had time for onions . Not until 1942 was the onion even listed on Chicago 's big , bustling Mercantile Exchange , and there was so little interest ( a mere 600 carlots traded v. 19,000 carlots of eggs ) that it was subsequently dropped . <P> But last week the lowly onion was back with a rush ; it was the hottest commodity* on the exchange and had pushed aside such heavily traded commodities as butter &; eggs . Hour after hour , shirtsleeved brokers bid high &; fast fof November futures , sending the price of a 50-lb. sack up as much as 50 in a day ( the maximum permitted ) . More onions would be traded this month , experts estimated , than in all of 1948 , when a record 21,214 carlots changed hands . <P> What started the onion boom was a Government forecast of a short crop-27.2 million sacks v. 31.6 million last year-and a trader 's hunch that the Govrnment forecast was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were caught napping two years ago when a short crop swept the price up from $3.80 to $6.50 jumped in too . <P> From $1.90 in early August the price soared to $3.93 on Sept. i , then slipped off to $2.69 . Last week it bounced back up under brisk bidding to $3.25 . Nor was the end of the boom in sight . Onions usually start coming into the market for delivery n November . But if the price is rising , and the crop short , many a farmer will probably hold out his onions and the short sellers scurry to cover their sales . Commented a trader happily : " That 's when prices will really begin to go up . " <P> <P> * The exchange handles only yellow globe and weet Spanish onions .
