In the practice of the world 's oldest profession , the water fronts of Port Said or Shanghai have never hummed more briskly than do London 's Piccadilly and gaudy , shoddy Soho . Day &; night girls walk their dogs , soliciting . Police look the other way , make few attempts to check the prostitutes ' health records . But only last week did British prudery permit a few ugly words to be spoken in public . <P> When U.S. and Canadian military authorities complained about prostitution , the British Government investigated , discovered a vicious increase in venereal diseases , decided the subject needed airing . The austere London Times quoted Sir Wilson Jameson , Chief Medical Officer of the Ministry of Health : " Because of an old tradition of hush-hush , the public does not know what it ought to . " Health authorities , said he , are handicapped by " this misguided secrecy . " <P> Sir Wilson 's facts and figures : Although Britain 's venereal-disease rate is low among nations , civilian infections of syphilis had increased from 5,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight times as prevalent . Nearly 70,000 civilians had contracted one of the diseases in 1941 . Added to the spread of the diseases within the military services , these figures mounted to a wartime increase of 70% . <P> There are 200 venereal-disease clinics for civilians in England and Wales . But , as in the U.S. , no law requires the diseased to go to them . Britain 's Defense Regulation 33B makes treatment of venereal diseases compulsory only when two other people can be found who will assert that they have been infected . <P> Last week in the House of Commons , copper-topped Dr. Edith Summerskill , who has practiced medicine for 18 years , moved " a prayer " for the annulment of Regulation 33B because it was inadequate . Said she : " The Minister of Health has approached this problem like a Victorian spinster reared in a country parsonage and sheltered from the facts of life . " <P> Dr. Summerskill estimated : " The casualties during the last year from venereal disease were far greater than the casualties of the blitz ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown : " There are moral and ethical and spiritual issues behind this question . . . . I would agree with the Victorians who hold the view that personal purity is the only complete prophylactic . " <P> By 245-to-31 , the House of Commons resolutely turned its eyes away , voted that Regulation 33B was adequate .
