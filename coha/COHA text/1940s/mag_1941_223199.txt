The Army had some real mechanized artillery to show last week-artillery that was actually self-propelled and could , at a pinch , fire on the enemy while racing into action . Experimental and soon to be improved though they were , these new weapons represented a tremendous advance over the Army 's earlier , so-called " mechanized " artillery , most of which is still hauled along backwards , like Civil War guns , except that trucks and tractors are hitched where horses used to be . <P> First purpose of the new artillery is to destroy tanks , and last week 's show was put on by GHQ 's Provisional Tank Destroyer Battalion , three weeks after it was organized at Ft . George G. Meade , Md . <P> On display were 36 75s , converted to anti-tank fire and mounted in armored trucks with tractor treads which could take them nearly anywhere a tank could go ( see cut ) . On tiny " jeeps " and swamp buggies-jeeps with enormous wheels and bus-size tires for mushing through mud and snow-were 18 ordinary anti-tank guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( like others soon to be organized and equipped ) is essentially a hit- &-run; outfit . Theory is that its fast , ultra-mobile weapons will dart at and around enemy tank formations , get in a death punch at the closest possible range , then scurry away from enemy fire . This mobility is about all the protection the crews of the open , unarmored 3 7-mm. carriers have . Even the semi-armored 75s are open at the top , thus are vulnerable to " plunging fire " from enemy aircraft , artillery , machine guns . Army designers had deliberately decided not to enclose crews and guns in armored turrets . The Army 's reasoning : in anti-tank warfare , speed is vital , and more weight is bound to mean less speed . <P> Watching the new weapons perform last week , remembering that new U.S. tanks carry equally heavy guns and are well armored to boot , civilians asked : why not fight tanks with tanks ? Answers : The " destroyers " use standard guns and truck chassis which are easier and cheaper to make than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lumbering tank formations can be equally effective against enemy troops , truck convoys , fortifications . <P> The Army will need a lot more tank destroyers than it had last week . It soon will have them : the armored trucks which carry the 75s are in quantity production ; 75-mm. guns are one thing the Army has a lot of . Henry Ford , American Bantam Car Co. and Willys-Overland are turning out thousands of jeeps , although 37-mm. gun production is still far behind the need . Still newer versions of destroyers are on the way , including a bigger-calibre anti-tank gun which eventually will relegate the 37 to the status of a third-line weapon .
