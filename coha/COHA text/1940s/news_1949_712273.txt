txt Today was thirty years almost to the t4a3i. after-tii6 Weimar Republic had been proclaiilled -. and the Germans were voting in their first free federal elections since that ill-fated republic died . ' The sun was bright and families strolled ' through village and city streets in their Aunday , best . There was , no excitement . The voters went quietly to the poll 's , perhaps with some trepidation . " It is not an easy thing to Vote , " said a young married man of nearby Hoechst . " Deep in everyone 's heart is the question whether some day today 's voters may not be punished for this . Your denazification was a lesson in more ways than one . " German officials had ordered flags displayed , but not many were . Occasionally , ' as one traveled through Western Germany , the black , red and gold of the new republic  --  the same as that of the Weimar flag  --  could be seen atop a public building . Sometimes the new republic 's colors were displayed alongside a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , but these were few . No crowds gathered around bulletin boards to watch the returns . There were no hectic broadcasts and no special editions of newspapers . It was a quiet , pleasant Sunday and some election officials were amused that a foreign newspaper man should be so interested . In the fourteenth-century town of Stauffenberg , near Giessen , the Burgomaster welcomed the voters to the polling place in his office . " Good morning , Herr Schmidt , " he would say . " The booth is right // GERMANS BALLOT IN DUTIFUL SPIRIT // here in the next room . Mark the ballot , place it in the box , then check your name with Herr Schulz . " The voter did as directed . His name was checked on the police registration list which also contained his address and birth date . A Countess came in , a tall , slightly crippled woman , attended , by a woman servant . She is the largest property holder in the area , her lands have not been affected by the slow-moving land reform . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prescribed circle , " the Burgomaster reminded her . For some reason she was the only one he reminded of this , Stauffenberg is a town of 1,570 persons . Most families have a small holding with perhaps a cow and a few pigs , but earn wages from a near-by metal factory . Since the war the town ? has voted half Socialist , half Free Democratic party , the right wing bourgeois party . The Burgomaster had no idea how the vote might go today . In Giessen , a city of 45,000 , in northern Hesse , one had to go right to the polling places to feel there was an election . Even the party posters liberally displayed on buildings and kiosks seemed , somehow , to command no attention . One of the polling places was a beer hall . The voting tables and booths were set up in an unobtrusive corner , which was empty , while elsewhere in the room tables were crowded with persons ordering beer and the typical meal of pork sausage and potatoes . Beer Is Better This Year " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grizzled old election official , wiping beer foam off his large mustache . " Last year in city elections we were set up in a basement down the street . This is much more pleasant  --  and besides the beer is better this year . " Similar scenes were repeated in Marburg , unitrersity town on the Lahn River . There are several United States installations in and near Mar/aurg , as well as a small number of displaced persons who have not yet . obtained their emigration orders . None of the displaced persons appeared near the polling places . A group of young men , standing in front of a store that contained a polling place talked about the election . " The turnout has not been so bad , " said one . " I would guess it ' at about 70 per cent . That may mean a Socialist victory around here . " Marburg , with a population of 43,000 , had given the Free Democrats a slight edge in post-war local elections , but these young ' men felt the Social Democrats were stronger now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once leader of the Social Democrats in the Sudetenland . " As a matter of fact , " said another young man , " it does not really make much difference who ' wins so long as there is a big turnout . If the vote is small the Communists will say we are opposed to this new government , and we are not so long as it is antiRussian . " " Yes , " a third said , " voting is a national duty . " So it went . Throughout Western Germany the citizen voted dutifully . There ' had been some fears that the farmers might find it more important to spend Sunday bringing in the harvest , which has been good despite the drought . But as one drove through the countryside he saw nobody in the fields .
