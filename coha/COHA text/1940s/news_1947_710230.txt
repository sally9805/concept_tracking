txt Peace and freedom are not easily achieved . They can not be attained by force . They come from mutual understanding and cooperation , from a willingness to deal fairly with every friendly nation in all matters  --  political and economic . These words , taken from its closing lines , formed the underlying theme of President Truman 's address at Waco yesterday , an address in which he developed that basic concept as it applied specifically in the field of foreign trade policy . The term " developed " is used advisedly . For this was no perfunctory speech on the part of the President . Announced in advance as a major address , it measured fully up to that standard . There was a documentary quality in its lack of oratorical flourish , in its sane objectivity and in the challenging logic that marked its closely reasoned passages . The seeds of economic aggression are to be found in world conditions today to an extent comparable only with that of the early Thirties .

In all these cases the natural temptation is for the government to step in and curtail imports . Such defensive measures lead to retaliation , and as the movement gains momentum it goes far beyond mere tariffraising . It embraces quotas , import licensing and all the assorted devices associated with isolationism and regimentation .

It would find itself in the position of " allocating foreign goods among importers and foreign markets among exporters , of telling every trader what he could buy or sell , and how much , and when and where .

The alternative is to apply in the area of world trade the principles represented in the political field by the U. N. That is the purpose for which the International Trade Organization , to be considered at Geneva next month , has been devised . The proposed charter of the ITO strictly limits the area of government intervention in foreign trade . At the same time , the ditde agreement negotiations which are to be conducted at the Geneva meeting are designed to restore and preserve " a trading system that is consistent with the continuing freedom of enterprise in every country that chooses freedom for its economy . " . The case for reciprocity in foreign trade has been argued forcefully on many occasions in the past . But it is doubtful if anyone has brought out more clearly than did Mr. Truman Yesterday the basic interdependence of economic peace , on the one hand , and freedom of enterprise , on the other , with all the historic connotation which the latter holds for political and personal freedom .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
