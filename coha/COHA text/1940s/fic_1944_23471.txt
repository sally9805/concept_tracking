Hansford Martin , formerly a college English instructor , has recently left the teaching profession to give all his time to writing . THE THOUSAND-YARD STARE A Story HANSFORD MARTIN D URHAM hastily scribbled , " 1 . Geo . Iso . 2 . Am . Sup. , " at the blackboard . Then he turned back to the class . " But besides these concepts of isolation and superiority , " he went on , " there was a third very significant idea responsible for Pearl Harbor  --  the simplest , the most natural , probably the most tragic of them all . " He paused and looked hopefully around the room , but the faces above the uniforms were as expressionless and private as if he were still speaking . Mr. Salyer , the sailor in the first row who always took notes on the lecture , laid down his pencil and waited . That was all . " Well , " Durham continued a little lamely , " that third idea was simply the good old American idea that Sunday is the day you rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Quickly , in his friendliest voice , Durham said , " Yes , Mr. Roberts ? " " Was that grammar the third or fourth chapter in the handbook for Monday ? Sir ? " added Mr. Roberts . " Damn it , " said Durham , " that 's not the point at the moment . " " Sorry , sir . " " It was the fourth chapter . " . " Thank you , sir . " Mr. Roberts took a fountain pen from the pocket of his jumper and made a note on the flyleaf of the grammar that lay open - NOM-   - -  .10 ? 1 ? ? mik before him . Then he carefully screwed the cap back on the fountain pen , and looked up at Durham as if he were giving him permission to continue . Durham often felt that the class was giving him permission to continue . Perhaps it was because they were in uniform and he was not . " What I want you to see , " Durham said , " is just how personally important these ideas were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance how the boys at Hickham field , sleeping late in their barracks because it was Sunday morning , how they were affected by these ideas ? " He fixed Mr. Stewart with his eyes . Mr. Stewart did not nod a confirmation . Mr. Stewart merely continued to demonstrate his talent for looking very sleepy and very military at the same time . " Because it was n't merely bombs that fell on Hickham that day , " said Durham . " Ideas exploded there . And those ideas , like many ideas , can kill a man as efficiently as a bullet . Do you see that ? That the idea which hits you is sometimes as deadly as the shell , sometimes more deadly ? Therefore as a matter of simple personal safety , the importance of understanding the ideas leveled against you ? " A wild yelp of laughter jumped like a geyser in the center of the room . Durham broke off , open-mouthed . The thin sailor whose name was Mr. Lawrence rose from his chair , his hand clasped over his lips as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a moment he stared at Durham , eyes frantic and merry over the brown fingers locked against the cheekbones , and then , shoulders quivering , he stumbled down the row of desks and out of the room . In the silence somebody sniggered once , and quickly shut up . Durham felt himself beginning to blush . " All right , then , " he almost shouted , " if you find this so amusing suppose you write me a short theme on Jefferson instead . On the relation , that is , of Jefferson 's ideas to Locke 's . Right now . " " In ink on theme paper ? " asked Mr. Roberts . " Sir . " Durham nodded , his lips clenched , already repentent of his temper . As they began to write , he sat there feeling lonely and indignant and confused , but not really angry , not even at the laughter of Mr. Lawrence . A part-time instructor in the academic program which was to prepare young men from the ranks for officers ' training in the United States Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inability to be angry at his students . They frustrated him with their indifferent solidarity , they gave him an envy for the life of shared experience where apparently no one was ever too lonely or too separate . But from his isolation he watched them with a wistful respect , the kind of emotion a man on an island might feel looking across at the happy natives of the mainland . When the bell rang and the papers began to flood the desk , Durham looked up and found Mr. Rogers waiting to speak to him . Every once in a while Mr. Rogers waited to speak with the instructor . It was a practice known in the Navy , Durham believed , as banging ear . But at times Mr. Rogers ' ear banging had proved useful . It was by this means Durham had learned a short time ago that the students no longer felt a definite resentment at the idea of a civilian almost their own age instructing them in the literature of the democratic tradition . He learned this when Mr. Rogers told himthat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could understand the war better if you were n't too close to it . What did Mr. Durham think of that idea ? Durham had been careful not to think too much of it , but admitted there might be a point there at that . " Well , " Mr. Rogers had said , " what we decided was that it probably took both points of view , inside and outside . " Durham had agreed gratefully , and since then had paid careful attention whenever Mr. Rogers began to bang ear . This morning the sailor seemed a little embarrassed . " I do n't know about this paper , " he told Durham . " Now that I think it over , it sounds a little like high-school stuff to me . " Like the majority of his classmates , Mr. Rogers had come into the service and the training program at the same time , fresh from high school , and he was still sensitive about being not so naval as he looked . " Well , " said Durham , " sometimes it 's hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I used to have trouble with it myself . " Mr. Rogers seized gratefully on the idea . " Yes sir , sir , " he said , unaware of any redundancy . " Especially on Saturday mornings ? " " Why , yes . " Durham was waiting anxiously to see where this would lead . " This is Saturday , is n't it ? " " And you know how it is on Saturday morning , sir . After Friday night . It 's pretty hard to think a thing through sometimes . And especially if you get duty in a place like this after you 've actually been in the fleet . " Durham tried to appear more sympathetic than bewildered . " I mean , " Mr. Rogers said carefully , " if you 've actually seen some action maybe , and then get sent to a place where there 's only a bunch of us swabbies who have n't seen any action , a man might take a night off sometimes , do n't you think so ? Even if he had classes the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean , " said Durham . " Then if he really lashed onto a good one the night before you would n't expect that man to be too sharp the next morn-ing , would you ? He would n't exactly be responsible for anything he did the next morning , would he ? Or wrote , " he amended , remembering that after all he was talking about a theme . " I get your point , " said Durham . " And I 'll keep it in mind when I look over these papers , Mr. Rogers . Thank you for mentioning it . " " Thank you , sir , " said Mr. Rogers . " I just happened to think about it . A lot of the boys here are pretty young , Mr. Durham , and do n't think about things like that . So I did n't see there was any harm in my mentioning it . " After the sailor had gone , Durham finished gathering the papers thoughtfully . Mr. Lawrence had always been a quiet boy , and young ; not possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Durham would have characterized him as a kid who was still confused about being in uniform at all . Now it seemed that Mr. Lawrence had seen action . He wondered what kind and how much . Most of all he wondered if Mr. Lawrence had tried to attend any other instructor 's class while he was still that drunk . MHE next afternoon Durham saw Mr. Lawrence again . He had just mailed his Sunday letter home , and was standing outside the post office wondering whether to go over to the library immediately or have a cup of coffee first , when he saw Mr. Lawrence coming down the sidewalk toward him . There was a loose smile on the thin sand-colored face , and his straw-colored hair was slightly mussed above a brow that was passionate and serene . He was walking , not unsteadily , with a rolling lateral motion that seemed to Durham to be the proper way for a real sailor to walk . But as Lawrence came closer , Durham realized that the smile was not a smile of recognition nor the walk the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by this time in a state of insulation where no voice from the outside world could set him laughing now . Whatever his distractions , they were private . Durham stepped back to let Mr. Lawrence pass but he did not act quickly enough , for their arms caught and Mr. Lawrence whirled slowly like a dying top that is about to fall , until Durham grabbed and steadied him . Mr. Lawrence 's happy face turned vaguely toward Durham , but the blue innocent eyes made no attempt to focus . He merely said , " Thanks so much , friend , whoever you are . " Durham was surprised to find the voice soft and clear except for the slightest fuzziness , blurred like his hair only around the edges . Durham let go of Mr. Lawrence and the sailor moved gently on , leaving the instructor feeling like a fool , for when he had grabbed Mr. Lawrence and swung him around , he had seen the line of ribbons the boy wore across his pocket . Two of them were the campaign ribbons for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not quite sure ; but the first one had been a purple band with white-striped ends . Durham had never seen one before outside of a magazine illustration , and the natural civilian respect he felt for almost any decoration was intensified by the thought that for the past six weeks he had been teaching the fundamentals of composition to a boy who had won the Purple Heart . Since ribbons were not worn in the classroom , there was no way he could have known of course . But there was an incongruity about it all that bothered him ; the ribbon and the youngness and the drunkenness would not reconcile themselves into a pattern acceptable to the academic mind . His eyes followed Mr. Lawrence as he tacked to his right , out into the street . There was the squawk of a horn from a yellow sedan that was bearing down on Mr. Lawrence 's course , but he kept right on walking . The car slowed down and squawked again , more indignantly . This time Mr. Lawrence stopped and turned his head wearily from side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fog instead of sunlight . But as the sedan swung into the channel left between the sailor and the curb , Mr. Lawrence began dreamily walking forward once more . A car from the opposite direction cut Durham 's vision . When he could see again the yellow automobile had one wheel on the curb and a white uniform was lying in the street beside the front fender . Just as he got to Lawrence , the door of the car swung open and a middle-aged man wearing horn-rimmed glasses stared down fascinatedly at the body beside the running board . " My God , " the man said , " I think I 've killed him . I think I 've killed him . " He looked up at Durham . " Did you see it ? He walked right into me . There was n't a thing I could do . I think I 've killed him . " He seemed incapable of moving from behind the steering wheel . " I do n't think so , " said Durham quickly , and he kneeled down and laid his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ear , but he could hear a steady beat beneath them . A hand tried to push his head away . Durham looked up irritably until he realized that the hand belonged to Mr. Lawrence . Though his eyes were still closed and his face looked paler , he appeared perfectly comfortable . " Lawrence , " said Durham , " are you all right ? " " It 's an accident ! " cried a female voice , and Durham saw that the inevitable crowd was beginning to gather . " For Christ 's sake , " said the driver , still peering down from behind the wheel , " ca n't you get him up off there ? " " I think he 's all right , ' said Durham . " Can you get up , Lawrence ? " He shook the boy 's shoulder , the white uniform snagging against the dusty asphalt . Lawrence opened his eyes , and without moving his head , looked up at the people clustered about him the way a man might look up from the bottom of a well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Your silly civilian faces . Silly living faces . " Then he closed his eyes again . " Why that boy 's drunk as a lord ! " said the female voice , and a man 's voice said , " They ought to get the authorities . " Durham looked around desperately . " It 'll be all right , " he said to the crowd . " I know the boy . If only someone will help me ? " He saw a student in the crowd whose face he recognized , but whose name he could n't remember . " You ! " he told him . " Give me a hand ! " The student pointed at himself in surprise , as if shocked by the suggestion , but Durham nodded his head fiercely and so the other sailor put his hands under one of Mr. Lawrence 's arms and Durham took the other , and they got him to his feet . " They ought to wait for the police , " said a voice in the crowd . " Are you sure he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quite all right , thank you , " said Mr. Lawrence , opening his eyes once more . " If you just wo n't bother ? " He tried to walk , and Durham and the student helped him around the car and up the curb . Lawrence 's step showed no signs of lameness but when the student let go of his arm he swayed as if he might fall again . " Keep going , you damn fool , " said Durham to the student . " We 've got to get him out of here . " He was not sure what the penalty in the Navy might be for getting run over while drunk , but he was afraid it might be serious and he wanted to get Mr. Lawrence away before the police or a Navy officer arrived . " But sir , " wailed the student , " I 've got a date back there ! " Durham ignored him , and they kept on walking until they turned into the sand path that led to the Union gardens . It was a fairly secluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Durham felt that Mr. Lawrence would be protected from official observation there . A LITTLE boy who had followed them from the crowd was still strolling along behind them , his eyes sparkling with wonder and restrained humor . They reminded Durham of Mr. Lawrence 's eyes yesterday morning in class when he had tried to keep from bursting out . " You go away ! " he said fiercely to the little boy . The boy stared at him a minute as if to see whether he really meant it or not . Durham scowled , and the boy turned around and started running back toward the street . " Thank God , " said Durham . " Do you know where Lawrence lives ? " " My barracks , sir , " said the student . " Burton . The big one by the library . But my date 's waiting ? " " Damn it , we ca n't leave him here ! if we get him over to Burton can someone take care of him ? " " I suppose so , " said the student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose ? " " Well , " he said , " I do n't know if anyone 's a very good buddy of Lawrence 's . I do n't know him hardly at all , myself . " " He 's got a roommate , has n't he ? " " His roommate do n't like him . " They stopped walking . Durham asked , " What 's the matter with him and his roommate ? " " Lawrence never talks to him . Lawrence never talks to anybody . He even gets drunk by himself . " " Well , surely , " said the instructor , " there must be somebody ? " " Oh , there 'll be somebody , " said the student , but he did n't seem to care much whether there would be or not . They began walking again . " It must be lonely for Mr. Lawrence , " said Durham . " It must be . Most the boys in Burton are all from around here anyhow . Nobody knows where he 's from . He does n't even get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were a serious defect in Mr. Lawrence 's character . Durham felt Lawrence 's arm joggled against him . " Where are you taking me ? " demanded Lawrence . " What if I do n't want to ? " " You see ? " said the student . " He talks like that all the time , even sober . When he talks at all , that is . " " It 's all right , Lawrence , " said Durham . " We 're going to get some rest . " " He do n't make sense , " the student said . He looked at Durham suddenly , confidingly . " What it is , it 's what they call the thousand-yard stare . " " The thousand-yard stare ? " " Yeah . " The student 's voice was low now , as if he were whispering a military secret . " That 's what they say in the fleet about men who 've had too much Pacific duty . They get funny . They get like they 're always watching something a long ways off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They call it the Asiatic Took , too , " the student added . " The thousand-yard stare , or else the Asiatic look . " " You 're from the fleet yourself , then ? " " Oh , no , " answered the student blithely . " We came straight down here from high school . " Mr. Lawrence 's voice broke in : " I said , where are you taking me ? " " We 're just going back to barracks now , " said Durham . Mr. Lawrence 's feet suddenly planted themselves on the path . " Thanks , no , " he said . " Thanks so much , but I 'm all right now . " He opened his eyes wide to show he was quite all right . " Well , then , " said the student quickly , and letting go of Lawrence 's arm he ran back down the path toward his waiting date . Durham watched him go with a kind of guilty despair . " Listen , Lawrence , " he said , " if you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm free of Durham 's . " You 'll see . " H E BEGAN walking down in the path in the direction of the gardens . Durham 's eyes followed him as he wandered beside the thick green bushes , a slight boy in a soiled white uniform , skinny for a hero . Then he saw Mr. Lawrence stumble and plunge through the green branches out of sight . He pushed through after him , and his first absurd impression was that Lawrence was grazing . He was there on his hands and knees in the grass , his head swinging up and down the way a goat 's will . Durham realized that he was trying to be sick . " Here , " he said , and planted his feet firmly at either side of Mr. Lawrence 's back so that he could hold his arms under Lawrence 's chest . " Go ahead ; get rid of it . " One of Lawrence 's hands pawed helplessly at Durham 's arms . " Damn it to hell , " he cried , his voice tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help me . If you 'll just leave me alone . All of you ? " Then his weight went shuddering onto Durham 's arms , and Durham could feel the scrawny muscles of Lawrence 's stomach contracting helplessly as he vomited . When he had finished , Durham did not try to lift him to his feet again . Instead he sat him back on the ground as if he were a baby , and took a handkerchief and began to wipe his mouth . " So sorry , friend , " said Lawrence , looking toward Durham in the effort of recognition once more . But he gave it up . " If you 'll just leave me alone for a while ? " " Certainly , " said Durham . " In just a minute . First , if you 'll scoot over here ? " He put his hands under Lawrence 's shoulders and helped him move a little closer to the bushes . " Nobody 'll bother you now , " said Durham , and Lawrence smiled gratefully and lay down on his back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bushes , and he began to let his head waggle back and forth as he stared into the sky . " Sea 's bluer , " he told Durham : " Much bluer . It rocks , too . And deep and dead and deep . " Then his eyes closed , and his head fell over to one side so that his cheek lay in the dirt at the root of the bushes . His ribbons had come unpinned and were lying on his chest almost ready to slip off . They looked to Durham a little like a life boat whose one end is still lashed to a ship which has heeled over on its side . So he stooped down and fastened them back into place . The three of them were all on one bar , not separate ; and the back of the bar had a safety catch . Durhamclicked this carefully . Then with his sleeve he brushed the medals and got back to his feet . Mr. Lawrence was beginning to snore a little and Durham did not mind leaving him there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bushes , and the only thing to do for him now was to leave him alone and let him sleep a while . As for himself , Durham turned back toward Main Street with a certain anticipation . It was almost six o'clock , the time for sandwich dates . He knew that all the places  --  Joe 's , The Varsity , The Greek 's  --  would be crowded with the college girls and the college boys in uniform . The booths would be bright with the girls ' sweaters ; the air would be hazy with the smoke from their cigarettes ; above the clatter of the coke glasses the men 's voices would mingle campus slang with the jargon of the service . Yesterday the idea of such places would have made him feel shy . But today he thought he would go and sit with them a while , though he knew what they would think , those that thought anything about him at all . They would look at him with a kind of scorn and suspicion because he would look like a lonely man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of them , and that no one would come to his booth and sit with him ; but somehow he did not believe that he was going to be much concerned with his own loneliness again .
