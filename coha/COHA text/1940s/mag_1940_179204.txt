Not all stars travel alone , like the sun . Many are paired , the two members revolving around each other like the ends of a spinning dumbbell . Such bright stars as Capella , Spica , Castor , Mizar ( a Big Dipper star ) and Algol ( the " Demon Star " ) are binaries ( doubles ) . Some stars occur in groups of more than two . Astronomers estimate that one-fourth or more of all the stars in the sky are doubles or multiples . Last week astronomers heard of a pair of stellar Siamese twins . <P> Sometimes the stars of a binary are so close together that even the most powerful telescopes show them as one. * But if their orbits are nearly edgewise to earth , then one star will periodically eclipse the other , and the light will correspondingly vary . By timing the eclipses , astronomers can tell approximately how far apart the two stars are . <P> A remarkable eclipsing binary is the star Beta Lyrae , in the constellation of Lyra ( The Harp ) . Astronomers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close together , for one has hardly stopped eclipsing the other before the other starts eclipsing the first . Dr. Gerard Peter Kuiper of the University of Chicago 's Yerkes Observatory last week surmised that the two stars comprising Beta Lyrae are in actual contact , like snowballs crushed together . <P> At an astronomical meeting at Wellesley , Mass. , Dr. Kuiper pictured star material rushing from the larger of the Beta Lyrae pair into the smaller at speeds around 200 miles per second-so fast that some of it is hurled clear beyond the small star to form a tail like a comet 's . As the stars revolve the tail is dragged around behind them , like a lagging feather . <P> <P> *No star is near enough to earth for its image to appear in the telescope as a disc ( as do the images of solar planets ) . If it were not for atmospheric diffusion and imperfections of the instrument , which convert star images into undulant blobs , they would appear in the telescope as sharp pinpoints of light .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
