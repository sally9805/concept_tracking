Off the submarine base at swank Mar del Plata , fishermen trolled through the wintry , misty Argentine dawn . Out of the grey murk loomed the bulk of a big sub marine . Its engines silent , it rolled gently with the waves . The fishermen noted the craft 's unfamiliar lines , went right on fishing . <P> Just before daylight , the submarine got under way , slid silently through the naval base 's narrow entrance . The sub swished past a sentry , standing with his back to the sea , and blinked a surrender signal to the control tower . The German sub marine , U-530 , Lieut . Otto Wermoutt , 25 , skipper , had indeed achieved the element of surprise . <P> The Argentine Navy treated the U-530 's crew of 54 men to a hot meal and a haircut , then interned them in a Navy rest camp . Skipper Wermoutt 's story : on V-E day , the U-530 was operating in the North Atlantic . He had decided to surrender at Mar del Plata . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months to get there , why the sub had jettisoned its deck guns , why the crew members carried no identification , nor what had happened to the ship 's log . <P> Rumor Crop . The unexpected arrival of the U-530 started a flood of rumors . Brazilian Admiral Jorge Dodsworth Mar tins , boiling mad over the loss of the cruiser Baa ( see above ) , said he believed " that the U-530 could have torpedoed the Baa . " Another Brazilian , Admiral Dudal Teixeira , believed that the U-530 came from Japan . An Argentine reporter topped them both : he had seen a Buenos Aires provincial police report to the effect that a strange submarine had surfaced off the long , lonely , lower Argentine coast , had landed a high-ranking officer and a civilian . They might have been Adolf Hitler and his wife , Eva Braun , in man 's dress . <P> Said the Argentine Naval Ministry 's official communique : 1 ) the German U-boat was not responsible for the sinking of the Baa ; 2 ) no Nazi leader or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landed no one on the Argentine coast before surrendering . <P> Would the Argentines , who had declared war on the Axis only four months ago , be allowed to keep the U-530 and its Nazi crew ? Said Argentina 's Acting Foreign Minister Csar Ameghino : the problem would be resolved " in a spirit of full cooperation with the United Nations . "
