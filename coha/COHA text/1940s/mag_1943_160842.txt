Dour , diffident Henry Morgenthau Jr . sat in the House Ways &; Means Committee room one morning last week munching raisins . Beside him also munching raisins sat his chief tax expert , small , dun-colored Randolph Paul . Now &; then they both drank water from a cone of paper cups piled beside a big water jug , while a battery of grey young Treasury experts , without benefit of raisins and water , periodically scrabbled for documents in accordion-sized brief cases . Morgenthau &; Co. needed their vitamins : they had been up most of the night before , putting the finishing touches on the Treasury 's recommendations for the 1944 tax bill . They had missed their breakfasts , too . <P> Almost before the Secretary had finished reading his prepared statement , the U.S. Treasury 's design for extracting another $10,500,000,000.00 from the U.S. pocketbook was mackerel-dead . Cried Democrat Robert L. ( " OF Muley " ) Doughton , head of the Ways &; Means Committee : " Utterly indefensible . " Cried Republican Harold Knutson : " How much of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> Henry Morgenthau 's failure was that he did not clearly define the fiscal problem that the U.S. faces-or show how that problem forced any particular tax solution on the country . <P> Thus his answer to the unstated probrlem was too unpalatable for Congress to swallow . He did not demonstrate that this was the best possible solution-and not politics . <P> Simplification . Actually there were several good points in the Treasury proposal . One of the great burdens of the tax system is that most taxpayers now must calculate and pay three separate Federal income taxes-the Victory tax , the normal tax and the surtax , each of which has a different set of exemptions and deductions . The Treasury proposed one consolidated income tax , in effect , by eliminating the Victory tax and the earned-income credit . <P> Painful Money . What made the Morgenthau proposals unpalatable was that they called for raising the total tax take on a married man 's income from 13% to 20% on a $3,000 income , from 18% to 28% on a $5,000 income , from 25% to 39% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would up personal income taxes by $6.5 billion . <P> These drastic increases would have been hard for Congress to take at any time . But the Secretary then muddied up the case for them . He declared : 1 ) the " dangerous dollars " in the hands of U.S. consumers with too few goods to buy were one of the chief reasons for drastic taxes ; 2 ) " four-fifths of all the income of the Nation is going to people earning less than $5,000 a year " ( and 65% of it to the $3,000-and-under brackets ) . Yet he proposed to lower the Federal taxes now assessed against most of those " dangerous dollars " by eliminating the Victory tax and proposing postwar refunds chiefly applicable to the low-income groups . The otherwise desirable elimination of the Victory tax would , under the Treasury 's plan , give a tax-free ride to 9,000,000 taxpayers from these low-income groups . ( Total taxpayers now : 44,000,000 . ) The new postwar credits would ease the load for another 14,000,000.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
