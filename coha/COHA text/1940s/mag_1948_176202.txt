In a third-floor room at the Russian consulate , Oksana Stepanovna Kosenkina nervously snapped off the mid-afternoon news broadcast . She walked to one of the windows overlooking the courtyard below , and wrenched it open . She stood there a moment-a plump , distraught , middle-aged woman in a ruffled blue dress . <P> Then she jumped . <P> Her body hit a skein of telephone wires , caught for a second and plunged on , ripping the wires loose from the walls . She landed , groaning , on the cement courtyard , the wire still wrapped in a tangle around her legs . There was an instant of silence . Then the whole neighborhood was in an uproar . <P> Kidnap or Rescue ? The Russian consulate is a five-story stone Manhattan town house ( leased from the niece of the late John D. Rockefeller ) on fashionable East 61st Street , across from the Hotel Pierre .

Police summoned an ambulance anyway . There was another brief scuffle , when police seized a letter written by Mrs. Kosenkina to a friend in Moscow . ( The letter was returned to consular officials . ) <P> But a half hour later Mrs. Kosenkina was under police guard at Manhattan 's Roosevelt Hospital . She had a broken leg and kneecap and internal injuries . She would be hospitalized for at least three months . <P> " Bird in a Cage . " As soon as she was able to talk , Oksana Kosenkina knocked all the Soviet protests into a cocked hat . <P> She told police that she had been thinking of suicide ever since she had allowed the Russians to bring her back from her New York hideaway . That afternoon was the first chance she had found . Said she : " I was like a bird in a cage . I had to get out-I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
