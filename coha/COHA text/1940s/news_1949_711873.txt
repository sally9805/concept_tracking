txt Israel 's first Constituent Assembly was formed today with rejoicing , tears and the heat of debate . The tears were hardly dry after a moving address by Dr. Chaim Weizmann , Provisional President , when the deputies launched into the battle for power . The two leading labor parties , Mapai and Mapam , held their ground as Menachem Begin 's Freedom party fought for a place in the Presidium . But the high spot of the colorful day was the stirring address by Dr. Weizmalut He reminded his audience of the prophecy , " remnants return , " and added , " but because we are the remnant , no more than a remnant , double and treble responsibility is laid upon us to fill the terrible void in our national life that has been created by the slaughter of the best sons of our people , the guardians of her spirit and the bearers of her culture . " He finished after paying tribute to memorable figures such as Theodor Herzl , Austrian journalist and founder of modern Zionism ; Louis D. Brandeis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Rothschild , French philanthropist whose funds helped in the establishment of Jewish settlement in Palestine during the early days of the Zionist movement . There was deep silence in the room , punctuated by muffled sobs . He himself had dabbed his eyes several times , and there were moments when it looked as if he could not go on . The assemblage was one of the most varied imaginable . There were former terrorists , rabbinical dignitaries , dark-skinned emissaries from Ethiopia , Arabs wearing tarbooshes and kaffiyehs , smartly dressed women , diplomats // wearing striped trousers and some deputies with open shirts and sweaters . After Dr. Weizmann had spoken , he read the oath that each deputy was to take . Each in turn answered in Hebrew as his name was called except for one Arab who replied in Arabic . The oath was reread to him in Arabic , and he again answered in his native tongue . Because the meeting was convened in Jerusalem , whose future is the subject of international controversy , there was no representation from the United States , Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia , Poland , CzechosloVakia , Yugoslavia , Uruguay , The Netherlands , Sweden , Denmark , Belgium , Norway and Cuba , and a representative of the honorary Spanish Consulate . There also were dignitaries of churches and religious groups , including Roman Catholic , Greek Orthodox , Bahai , Druse , Moslem , Copt and Armenian . When Dr. Weizmann reached Jerusalem this afternoon from his home in Rehovoth , his car was met at the flag-decorated entrance to the city by a motorized and mounted guard of honor that led him through the largest crowds in the history of modern Jerusalem . The ceremony of forming the Assembly was to have been a simple affair , with the emphasis on bare formalities . Few seemed prepared for the lively debates that followed . After Mapam and gapai had won the day , along with the religious bloc , which also will have representation in the Presidium , there was a discordant note from the Communist section . When Eliezer Preminger , a Communist Deputy , arose to contest a technical point of parliamentary procedure , the leader of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Preminger had been " purged " from the party and did not represent the Israeli Communists . Mr. Preminger then announced that he would form his own party . Mr. Begin and Peter Bergson fought bitterly for the appointment of an additional vice president so that Heruth , the former Irgun Zvai Leumi , could be represented . Mapam 's objections to Heruth won out , and as a resuit the vice presidents will be from the Mapai , the Mapam and the religious bloc . The decision will be made tomorrow after the first transitory constitution is approved . Dr. Weizmann probably will be elected President at the last session , on Thursday , and he will then call on Provisional Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion , leader of the Mapai , the strongest party , to name the members of the government . This will be done when the Deputies reconvene in Tel Aviv on Sunday . Dr. Weizmann characterized the creation of the new state as the " redemption of our people after centuries of affliction and suffering . " But he warned that , as a result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? them and their responsibility was great . " Today 's event has , issued out of the great awakening of national will that aroused our people in the last few generations , " he said . " Those who strove to realize this dream took two paths . The first was the way of spiritual revival , the return to the wellspring of the Jewish tradition , the renewal of the Hebrew language and literature , the gathering of the scattered forces of our people in one bond , the effort of education and enlightenment , the public proclamation of our historic fights and the support from the rulers of the nations . " He stated that the first path had led to the World Zionist Organization , where the vision became a reality , and to the establishment of the Jewish Agency , the Zionists ' political organ and instrument of colonization . The second path , he said , was taken by the pioneers who carved out the roads and broke the stones upon which the future was built . He said that the two paths finally converged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state was formed , the union of the two trends was completed .
