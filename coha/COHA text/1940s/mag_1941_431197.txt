 | Fear Over Hollywood Condensed from Stage Y. P. McEvoy WHAT 'S WRONG with the movies ? Adolph Zukor is credited with the most profound analysis to date . Said Adolph , gravely , at a meeting of Paramount directors : " When the money stopped coming in , I knew there was something wrong . " There is indeed something wrong . But try to put your finger on it . Practically everything you will hear about the movie industry is wrong . There are too many pictures ; there are n't enough pictures . Double bills are unpopular ; the public demands double bills . The star system is ruining the business ; the most successful company is built on the star system . Movies can not survive block booking ; they can not survive without it . Censorship is killing the movies . The movies are killing censorship . And the movies are killing the movies . The only point of general agreement is that somewhere something is sour . But where ? Ironically enough , Adolph Zukor himself started the disastrous chain of events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double features when , after cornering the star market , he set out to buy , build , or control all the theaters . Naturally , the other companies started to outbuy or outbuild Adolph . Result : Paramount at its peak owned or controlled 1600 theaters ; Fox 1000 , Warners 600 ; Loew and RKO 200 apiece . Result : Enough pictures , good , bad , or indifferent , had to be made to supply all these theaters . Result : The necessity of making more than 600 feature-length pictures a year . And there are n't that many good actors and directors or good stories . How many good plays are there a year ? Half a dozen . Good novels ? Fifty ? Generous . Saddled by a production curse grown out of real estate greed , Hollywood never could have enough of any ingredient to supply it , except raw film . That comes in by the carload , is run through the studio sausage mills , flavored with synthetic comedy , drama , love and hooey , chopped into convenient lengths , and shipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers a week . How many is umpty ? The Hays office says in 1930 an average of 8o,000,000 movie tickets were sold each week . Where did the Hays office get its figures ? From the U. S. Department of Commerce . Where did the Department of Commerce get them ? From the Hays office . The average is now  | said to be down to 65,000,000 a week , but nobody knows . However , though no two authorities agree on the quantity of customers or cash , they all agree it ai n't what it used to be , if it ever was . As for what is to blame , some point to broadcasting , quoting Fortune 's survey that 79 percent would give up movies rather than radio , and clinch it with the fact of a 2o-percent increase in listeners last year . Others blame night sports , good roads , double features . Goldwyn quotes a Gallup Poll of three to one against double features . Three who ? Three little boys , who would sit through six Westerns ; or three mothers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants double features . Theater owners unanimously oppose them . Women 's clubs , parents , teachers , decry them . Your neighbor hates them . So do you . Then who likes them ? The juvenile public that wants **34;138;TOOLONG . And ages 13 to 21 go to movies more than once a week , while people over that age , who form the bulk of the population and are best able to afford movies , support them the least . The answer to why is the solution of the cinema 's headache . Fewer pictures is part of the answer , with talent not spread so thin . The B picture , deliberately inferior , has been taken off the production schedules of most Hollywood studios . Only an industry with a fabulous capacity for absorbing waste could have sold a product which it advertised as inferior . Fewer pictures will mean better pictures ? and not enough pictures to supply double bills . Better pictures and no double bills may help win back the attendance of adults . A device that made B pictures profitable , and contributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the studio 's entire yearly output in advance , sight-unseen . The exhibitor had to buy all or none , the bad with the good . True , he had cancellation privileges on 10 or 20 percent ; but he was stuck with the rest , and often he was forced to double bill in order to get some of his money back . After a bitter fight the studios have capitulated to the government and the majority have agreed that not more than five pictures can be sold as a block , and these only after the exhibitor has seen what he is buying . Eventually this should give the double bill its coup de grace . Then there is the foreign market , or there it was . Thirty to 40 percent of the gross receipts of Hollywood pictures came from overseas , the majority of them from the British Empire . All this is now " kapoot " in every language , including the Scandinavian . Can the industry go on paying huge salaries and bonuses with the domestic market going and the foreign market gone ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You have to go back ten or eleven years , when Sound came in , to find its counterpart . From the silver screen the voice of Al Jolson hollered " Mammy " and the walls of every Hollywood studio came tumbling down , burying millions in equipment and crushing out a galaxy of silent stars . But eventually Sound built up the industry to new peaks . Today there is no such promise . The public has raced through the nursery and played with all the toys ? sound , technicolor , supersize screens , opera stars , symphony orchestras , the greatest artists from drama , concert , dance and radio . It has seen all the great plays , the great novels , with six , eight and ten stars in a single picture . With their public unsatisfied and yelling for more , theaters have added vaudeville acts , organ recitals , free refrigerators , stoves and automobiles . More , more , yelled the public , and the theaters doubled the bill , tripled it , added cartoons and shorts and newsreels and dishes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bingo and Bunko . More and more people went to the theater less and less ? and the Great Fear grew . " What else can we give you ? " moaned Hollywood to the movie public . The public did n't know and could n't tell . How could the public know that what it wanted ? instead of two or three sterile formula pictures , garnished with kitchenware ? was a magical masterpiece called Snow White ? But as soon as the public saw it , it knew , and rushed to the box offices in numbers unknown since T ' he Birth of a Nation . " But , " said Hollywood , " Snow White is a freak . No regular picture with live stars could gross that much . It 's impossible , and we can prove it . " After they had proved it to everybody 's satisfaction , out came Gone With the Wind , which within a few months grossed three times as much as Snow White and is expected to top $20,000,000 . Hollywood took heart . " Now we know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public wants long pictures at high prices . " So they all have started to make pictures longer and boost prices higher . Do you wonder what 's wrong with Hollywood ? It took three years and almost $4,000,000 to make Gone With the Wind . Before that a thousand-page novel had to be written and sold to more than a million readers . How could an industry that tries to make boo pictures a year , or a studio that schedules one full-length picture a week , hope to roll out Gone-With-the-Winds on a belt-line assembly ? No ; the cure is a drastic reduction of excess theaters and surplus pictures . There is plenty of firstrate talent in Hollywood to make a limited number of good pictures . There is sufficient extraordinary  | talent to make a few extra-good pictures . But even this talent can not function at its best until it is freed from a censorship which puts a premium on the innocuous . Adult talent can not make adult pictures under a juvenile code . There is no more reason why all pictures should be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music be under censorship which boils everything down to an insipid infantile mush . A free screen is as necessary to vital pictures as a free press is to vital literature . To each and every minority pressure group hell bent on saving the movies from sin and succeeding only too well in sapping them of substance , Hollywood should cry out , in the words of the distressed maiden , " Unhand me , villain ! " Then there is the basic bewilderment as to whether the organized confusion known as picture making is an Art or an Industry . If asked , " Why do n't you strive for higher artistic standards , " the Big Boys reply , " This is a business . " If you point out that every other business of comparable size and importance supports research and can supply complete and accurate manufacturing and marketing statistics , you are brushed off with , " Making Pictures is an Art . " By artful dodging between these two poles they hope to evade all legitimate criticism for business inefficiency and artistic ineptitude . Whether they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the making of pictures is a business . But the vital statistics of its fiscal affairs are incomplete , inaccurate and incoherent . The Carnegie Foundation , financing an independent survey , after three years of intensive research , is still struggling to find out where the vast receipts of the industry come from , how much they amount to , and who gets what . So long as the movie factories , artistically referred to as studios , grind out fantasies by formula , guided by facts that are mostly fantasy , the fear that hangs over Hollywood will continue .
