The Department of Commerce deflated the four-year-old notion that U.S. sho pers have been on a four-year buying spree . Estimating retail sales for 1944 , the Department predicted that the quantity of goods bought this year would be only 15% greater than in 1939 , and 5% less than in 1941 . But the Department 's report confirmed what every housewife knows : sky-high retail prices make purchases of essentials seem like a mad squandering of money . Thus the dollar volume of retail sales this year are guesstimated at an alltime peak of $67 billion - up 60% over 1939 , and 20% over 1941.
