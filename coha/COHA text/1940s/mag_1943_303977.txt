For 30 years San Francisco 's Hale Bros. , one of the city 's oldest and biggest department stores , did business in a six-story Market Street building . For only ten years the J. C. Penney Co. has operated one of its 1,600 stores half a block down Market Street towards the Bay . Last week Hale 's and Penney 's were switching stores . But most San Franciscans were mystified about the reasons . <P> <P> Behind the Hale-Penney swap was an object lesson : " How To Get On in the Real-Estate Business . " <P> How Not To Do It . Hale Bros. ' building was built on land leased from an estate ( the rent : $90,000 a year ) , on a deal wherein the store would revert to the landowners , upon payment to Hale 's of $350,000 when the lease ran out in 1944 . Once Hale 's almost bought the site for $1,500,000 , but stalled for a better bargain . Then someone else snapped up the whole works : San Francisco 's famed real-estate operator , Louis R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine bargain-even for him . He paid $1,525,000 for the land , took up the estate 's debt to Hale 's at its $350,000 face value and , as he puts it , " The building itself is worth a million dollars today . " <P> Then he offered Hale Bros. : 1 ) a for-the-duration lease at their old rental , or 2 ) a 50-year lease at $106,000 . Hale 's management stalled again . The next thing they knew he had leased it out from under them to J. C. Penney for a cool minimum guarantee of $180,000 a year . <P> Hale Bros , found itself stuck . With San Francisco jammed with war work , it had to move into Penney 's old quarters at a still higher rental ( $120,000 ) than Lurie 's top price to them . To add insult to injury , Penney 's nondescript store site was hard by San Francisco 's largest department store , The Emporium . Hale 's only consolation : the hope ( and expense ) of building a brand-new store on another Market Street corner after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hale-Penney operation was atypical Louie Lurie coup . <P> Lurie , born on Chicago 's tough West Side , quit school in the third grade to sell papers , did so well with the brand-new Chicago American . ( " Whatever the customer gave us , we 'd take and run away " ) that Hearst had to run page-one notices calling attention to the paper 's official 1 price . Then he drifted out to Vancouver , made and lost several small fortunes learning the real-estate business . <P> By the end of World War I Louie Lurie had settled in San Francisco . As he tells it now , his formula was beautifully simple : " I 'd buy lots south of Market Street for $5,000 , put up a $10,000 building and sell the deal for $18,000-$20,000 . " In that way he 1 ) put up 259 buildings , including a score of San Francisco 's cinemas ; 2 ) kept his own growing fortune strictly liquid . The Hale-Penney deal did nothing to harm his finances .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
