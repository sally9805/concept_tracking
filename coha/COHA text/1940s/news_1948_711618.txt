QUILL PLAN FAILS Strategy of a Brief Halt to Force PSC Action on Fares Backfires MAYOR DENOUNCES REVOLT City Omnibus Corporation Puts First Buses in Operation Soon After 1 A. M. By A. H. RASKIN After a miscarriage in union strategy had turned a planned four-hour work stoppage into the biggest bus strike in the city 's history , 1,000 of the 8,500 drivers involved voted overwhelmingly last night to end the wildcat tie-up and restore normal service to 3,500,000 riders this morning . Buses of the New York City Omnibus Corporation began operating soon after 1 o'clock this morning , according to reports from the company 's garages . Company officials said sixteen buses were running on various lines at 2 A. M. from the garage at Ninety-ninth Street and Lexington Avenue . The lines on which buses were moving were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 116th Street crosstown and the Madison Avenue line . The company estimated that by 5 A. M. thirteen more buses would be operating on the Eighth , Columbus and Lexington Avenue lines . Whether the vote , taken at a stormy meeting in the headquarters of the Transport Workers Union , CIO , would quell the revolt that forced a complete suspension of service on seven private bus and trolley car lines was impossible to determine . At least 1,500 workers who were unable to enter the hall were urged by left-wing leaders of the insurgent group to stay on strike and to stop other workers from operating . Six hundred of the rebel group adjourned to another hall nearby and voted to set up a thirtysix-man strike committee in anticipation of a long tie-up . The group urged all the drivers to meet at 1 P. M. today at St. Nicholas Arena , Columbus Avenue and Sixty-sixth Street . Douglas L. , secretary-treasurer of the union , announced that he was seeking the support of the leftistcontrolled international executive board for a proposal to advance the strikers 5100,000 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation almost as confused as it'had been in mid-afternoon when the insurgents rejected appeals by Mayor O'Dwyer and Michael J. Quill , president of the union , to go back to work after a union-sponsored mass demonstration by 8,500 drivers outside the offices of the State Public Service Commission in the Woolworth Building . No Buses or Trolleys Run Only about 10 per cent of the men returned to their jobs and roving bands of strikers soon compelled all these to quit . With no buses or trolleys operating on the lines that serve most of Manhattan , the Bronx , Queens and lower Westchester County , the Mayor announced at 5 P. M. , that the city would run its own buses manned by city employes over some of the struck routes in the Bronx . He estimated that transportation . for 50,000 riders would be available in time for this evening 's homeward rush in areas that require buses to get workers to and from outlying subway stations . Both the Mayor and Mr. Quill denounced the revolt against the ' union 's back-to-work plea as Communist-inspired . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee joined in a message to be distributed at all garages this morning urging the 8,500 drivers and mechanics to resume work . Mr. Quill. predicted that " the overwhelming . majority ? would respond to this appeal . However , his optimism found no reflection in the views of the rebellious rank-and-file . Spurred on by . Austin Hogan , leftist president of the New York local , who has been engaged in a. battle with Mr. Quill ' for control of the union , 1,500 of the strikers voted earlier in the . // day to stay out until they won new contracts containing pensions , higher pay and other concessions in addition to the retroactive wage increase for which the original stoppage was called . They left the union hall at 153 West Sixty-fourth Street with instructions from Mr. Hogan to eschew violence but to " persuade " drivers to keep buses off the streets . Within an hour they had turned 150 buses back to their garages and brought a decision by the companies to abandon further efforts to maintain service . The companies denounced the strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wildcat walkout that grew out of it  --  as a violation of their contracts with the TWU . The three biggest companies ? the Fifth Avenue Coach Company , the Third Avenue Transit Corporation and the New York City Omnibus Corporation ? said they would hold the union and the men accountable for all loss and damage . The Fifth Avenue and New York City Omnibus companies went further and warned that if the men did not come back in time to permit full service this morning , the lines would consider themselves free from any further obligation to carry out any contract commitments , including those calling for retroactive wage payments . To " Put Heat " on PSC The work stoppage , which began at 9 A. M. , had been called by Mr. Quill as a means of " putting the heat " on the State Public Service Commission to authorize higher fares for the private companies and thus make it possible for them to make full payment on retroactive pay increases of 24 cents an hour to which the companies agreed last May . By 11 A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside the PSC offices in the Woolworth Building . They were herded by the police into Barclay Street , where Mr. Quill and other union leaders addressed them from a sound truck . Mr. Hogan , who had no part in planning the union strategy , was pushed to the back of the truck during most of the speech-making . Although all the remarks were supposedly directed to the commission , its members were 142 miles away ' in Albany attending a regularly scheduled meeting . Milo R. Maltbie , 77-year-old chairman of the PSC , emphasized that the decision to meet in Albany had been made weeks ago in accordance with the commission 's normal practice of alternating meetings between New York and Albany , and that the union 's rally had nothing to do with this schedule . No Hint as to Duration For well over an hour TWU leaders hammered away at the notion that Governor Dewey and the PSC were " playing polities " with the bread and butter of transit ' workers by " stalling " on the fare applications . There was no hint from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stoppage to be a short-lived affair or a full-fledged strike . The crowd listened restively waiting for a. clue as to whether they were participating in a dem-. onstration or a strike . Speaker , after speaker took the stand without disclosing the union 's strategy . Mr. Hogan , when called upon to speak , admitted he did not know what the union was up to , but he emphasized his own belief that the union should stop worrying about politics and the fare and should turn its strike into " the real McCoy . " His talk drew a few cheers but most of the crowd paid little heed . , Finally Mr. Quill took the microphone and began a tirade against the Governor and the PSC for permitting transit companies in other parts of the state to raise their fares to a dime or more , while no action was taken on a permanent increase for the New York companies . He spoke for fifteen minutes without answering the $64 question in the minds of his hearers  --  was this to be a strike or were they to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the middle of his speech the Mayor appeared beside the sound truck . Without dropping a syllable , Mr. Quill , who had rejected an appeal by the Mayor to postpone the strike on Monday , said : " We have a friend here , " and welcomed the Mayor to the platform . The Mayor assured the drivers of his own support in their demand for full retroactive pay and praised them for their " patience " in waiting for the financial position of the companies to improve through a higher fare . He recalled that he had to fight the left-wing faction in the TWU leadership in his campaign for higher fares and he urged the drivers to go along with him now in recognizing that " you ca n't squeeze blood out of a stone . " He asked them to consider the public that had supported the higher subway and bus fare by calling off the stoppage and going back to work in time to pick up homebound school children and workers . Return to Work Ordered Mr. Quill was at the microphone in an instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor 's request , the TWU leader asked : " Are you ready to follow your TWU leadership ? " There was a chorus of yeses from the crowd . " Then your negotiating committee asks you to heed the request ' of the Mayor and return to work . " Amid confused shouts from the members , he put the question to a vote . The show of hands seemed about even to most observers , with some feeling one side or the other had a narrow margin , but Mr. Quill merely observed : " 0 . K. Return to work . " He left the sound truck at once , followed by all the other officials , including Mr. Hogan . However , most of the crowd stayed where it was . Protests and cries of " Sell , out ! " arose in some sections , particularly among drivers of the Third Avenue company , who have not yet received any part of their retroactive pay . Several rank-and-file drivers climbed on the sound truck and tried to talk through the microphone . The sound came on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the union leaders and demands that the tie-up continue until the union won new contracts with the companies . Mr. Hogan reappeared and urged the entire group to proceed to Transport Hall to continue the ' meeting , instead of pursuing the matter further on the streets . At the meeting , which got under way , at 2 P. M. , Mr. Hogan was in corn-I mand , although a number of the men who crowded into the hall I made it clear that they had little sympathy with his left-wing political connections . Neither Mr. Quill nor any member of his faction attended the rump session , which ended with Mr. Hogan advising his followers to stay on strike and giving an assurance that he would be with them " 100 per cent . " Situation Reversed at Night However , the situation was reversed at night when Mr. Quill and Mr. Hogan battled it out at another meeting in the same hall . With the rank-and-file element demanding extension of the walkout , Mr. Quill told the 1,000 persons at the session that he would lead the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any good . He asserted that the demonstration had already resulted in a " tremendous victory " in that the PSC had scheduled hearings for next week on the fare applications of the major bus lines . A commission spokesman acknowledged that a hearing had been set for next Wednesday on the Third Avenue company 's application , but said the others had been scheduled previously . The commission took no action on any of the bus applications at yesterday 's meeting in Albany . The night meeting in the union hall was marked by a number of near-fights and much booing first of Mr. Quill and later of Mr. Hogan . The whole temper of the meeting shifted rapidly from Hogan to Quill after the TWU president spoke . When the vote was taken fewer than fifty recorded themselves in favor of staying out . Immediately after the session Mr. Hogan put his head out of a second-story window to address the 1,500 persons outside the hall . While he was trying to make himself heard , Mr. Quill climbed on top of a parked car and began shouting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take up a similar vantage point atop a car , but the street session broke up with relatively few of the men able to hear either speaker . The Hogan faction moved to the editorial offices of the TWU Bulletin , organ of the international union , at 797 Eighth Avenue , where the strike committee was set up with Mr. Hogan as chairman . The group voted to accept the offer of Harry Sacher , counsel of the TWU , to act as its attorney without fee for the duration of the strike . Mr. Sacher was recently ousted as counsel of the New York local at . Mr. Quin 's instigation . Mr. Quill predicted that the revolt would be at an end by this morning . He said TWU stewards would be at all garages to urge men to take buses out . The rankand-file group indicated that it would also have representatives at all garages to urge prolongation of the tie-up . In a press conference at City Hall late in the afternoon , the Mayor threw his influence behind Mr. Quill 's effort to end the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did operate . The Mayor said the- whole fight was " obviously a part of the battle for control of the union " by , Communist elements under the leadership of Mr. Hogan , John Santo , national organizing director , whose deportation is being sought by the Government , and Mr.
