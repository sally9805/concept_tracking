Though he would seldom walk a mile for a cigaret , T. Harper Goodspeed is so addicted to nicotine that he traveled 12,000 miles to risk his neck traipsing about the Andes to gather tobacco plants . As heroic as his efforts were some of his finds - tobacco plants 40 feet high . <P> Goodspeed 's addiction is chiefly botanical : he was hunting for new species of tobacco and other plants for the practical U.S. Department of Agriculture and for his own purer research at the University of California . He tells his adventures in a new book , Plant Hunters in the Andes ( Farrar &; Rinehart ; $5 ) . Like all scientists who have pillaged foreign flora for the profit of U.S. agriculture , Goodspeed and his staff had no easy time . They slept in huts tumbling with guinea pigs , which Peruvians keep as pets . They rode along precipices on dynamite trucks . They broke the ice in hog troughs to wash their morning faces . <P> Peruvians would often snicker and guffaw as they watched Goodspeed scramble after odd plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really interested the botanist was the fact that many of the earth 's 60 species of Nicotiana grow among the Andes . There , scientists believe , the Nicotiana tabacum now commonly smoked developed long ago through natural hybridization . Federal tobaccomen think that wild , tough plants from their native mountains can perhaps be crossed with the highly bred , less vigorous tobacco strains now cultivated in the U.S. , to increase their resistance to fungi , bacteria , viruses , insects which yearly cost growers millions of dollars . <P> <P> Smoker as well as botanist , Goodspeed hopes that his plant exploration may consummate the sublime vision of the late U.S. Vice President Thomas Riley Marshall : a good 5 cigar .
