Ice jams in the gorges of the Danube broke up last fortnight and floated down toward the Black Sea . Last week upriver traffic started , and among the first to move were 30 barges carrying 18,000 tons of Rumanian oil to Germany-about one-seventh of that blockaded country 's monthly oil quota from Europe 's prime economic battleground . <P> British agents having bought up or leased all the loose Danube tanker barges in sight , Nazis were relieved last week when Yugoslavia-through which the Danube winds for some 200 miles-released seven big German oil barges which had been held for special transit permits . <P> Sixteen other German barges were still held , with five Hungarian ones , two belonging to Socony-Vacuum . The Yugoslav permits are a new clog in Germany 's supply line wherein the fine hand of British diplomacy may or may not be seen . Should Germany decide to impose her own control of through traffic on the Danube , fireworks might well follow in the Balkans . <P> As fuel for the carburetors of Germany started up the Danube , muscle for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motor torpedo boats of the swift ( 47-knot ) type which Great Britain has built by the dozen for service in the Channel , the Mediterranean and perhaps the Baltic , were sold by Britain to Rumania this winter . When ice left the rivers of France , up the Seine right through Paris snored these swift and lethal little craft . Turning out of the Seine into the Yonne just below Montereau it is possible to navigate that stream to the Armanc , on , continue by canal south to Dijon , thence by another canal into the Saone , which flows into the broad , Alp-born Rhone , which enters the Mediterranean just west of Marseille , thus cutting off a long , rough trip around Spain . From photographs taken from a bridge in Paris , the British sea wasps for Rumania looked like 70-ft . Vospers , each mounting two 21-inch torpedo tubes , powered with three 1,150-h.p. motors and two auxiliary engines for sneak-up work at nine knots . The boats were described as intended for patrol duty in the Black Sea , but if trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve .
