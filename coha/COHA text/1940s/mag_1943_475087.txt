IN the early morning I made my way to the shipyards . It was exciting to rise at five-thirty while my family slept ( although my husband and children had begged to be awakened ) and to feel my way along the path to the car . For me , a housewife who had not held a job since that year 's schooltcaching before marriage , this was adventure indeed . I was going down to the sea to build ships . Over and over for months I had heard from the radio the call for women to enter war work . I had been delaying for one reason or another but I finally recognized these arguments in favor of my going to the shipyards : my children , now in their teens , were able to take some responsibility for our home ; I wanted to help out the war effort more than I had been doing through a few voluntary services ; and with living costs always going up and the children 's education looming ahead , we could use the money . So I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had attended a defense class for shipfitters , and was now on my way to an actual job at Richmond . It was still half dark when I reached the shipyards . The sky was a lovely gray with white behind it . All objects seemed to have been dipped in grayness ; the buildings in the background , the arch over the entrance , reading " Kaiser Shipyards Co. , " the great cranes , the checking booths were all gray like the sea beyond . I was borne along by the crowd and permitted to enter through the guarded gate when I had shown my temporary pass . I stood in a long Iine to receive papers ; I stood in another line to receive tool checks ( for every tool borrowed , a chip from your stack ) . At last some sixty of us women were herded to a personnel building , where a young man addressed us on safety precautions , the woman counselor for the day shift advised us about our clothing , and then. , after a tour of the yard , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed . The names of the welders were called and responded to . An escort was assigned to take them to their locations . The burners were selected , the flangcrs , the chippers , the checkers . Only a sparse group remained to be grouped as shipfitters ' helpers ? six women besides myself , Negro and white . Again we started out en masse ; this time to a little cottage which was labeled " Master Shipfittcr . " The man upon whom the cottage door opened was small and harassed . We were presented to him a little apologetically , I thought , by our guide . " What have you got there ? " the shipfitter asked . " Just a few shipfitter helpers , Mr. Jepson . " " Oh , my God ! Women shipfitters . Why do they treat me like this ? Women shipfitters . How many ? " " Seven . " " 1 told you we could n't use any more . " " Then why were we employed ? " I could n't help asking . " Why ? Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Say , tell me this , how many of you attended defense school ? " No one except me answered " Yes . " Mr. Jepson lifted and dropped his shoulders and hands in an exaggerated gesture of disgust . " What did I tell you ? " he said to the room at large . " We sign an agreement with the unions and the Maritime Commission not to employ anyone but those who have gone to defense schools and here 's what we get ? one who has been to school and six who have n't ! " He rolled his eyes and shrugged . " You 'll have to stay and help me place them . Take some over to Brown in the plate shop . " " I do n't dare , " our escort said . " I took him two yesterday when he did n't need them . He said if I ever brought him any more . . . " " I know . I know . Well , call up Foster . " " That woman-hater ! " " Well , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got to come around to it . " " All right , " the young man replied and took up the telephone . " But what he 'll say will hurt my eardrums . . Hello , Gilly , this is Frank for Jepson . We have some women shipfitter helpers here . How about ? " He held the receiver a foot or two away , grinning at it . Mr. Jepson smiled and sighed . " Well , do n't bother to phone . Just take two or three over to Steel and the rest down to the basins . They 've got ta take ' em . " I rose in what I hoped was dignity . " I 've heard enough . We were urged to enlist in defense work ; I was trained five weeks in school ; I was employed by the Richmond Shipyards ; I was cleared by the union ; I was photographed , fingerprinted , and lectured , but no one hinted that we were not wanted . How do I check out ? " Mr. Jepson arose at once and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think we do n't want you . We need you all right . It 's just ? " he shrugged and rolled his eyes --  " so manyof the men want ? well , experienced shipfitters , men . You 've had school . You 'll get along . You go down to the basin with Frank , at least for the day until I can find a better place for you . " I saw no more of my fellow shipfitter helpers . I was sent to work on a nearly completed hull in one of the concrete basins ? a hull which had been constructed up to its weather deck . I found myself on the rusty black steel more amazed than ever before . I was assigned to a leaderman working high on the side of the ship . " You come along with me , duchess . I 'll teach you how to make scuppers . Come on . " To " come on " meant to clamber over the side of the ship until I felt the scaffolding beneath me . The simplest way seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for I was not going to be caught lagging behind the men here where I was the only woman on the side of the hull . Sometimes a worker would extend a hand of assistance . I refused to see it . I jumped from deck to scaffold , catching myself by a clutch at a handy pipe ; I squeezed to the outer edge of the support to allow another worker to pass ; I ran along the scaffold planks . All this in abysmal ignorance of where I was . It was hours later , I think , when my leaderman , standing beside me , tossed a little piece of wood or rag overboard and I heard no sound from it as it fell or lighted . I looked over and down , and down , and then crept by inches back to the security of the hull 's side . No soft billowy water lay beneath us , but a great depth of brutal concrete . " Do people often fall off the scaffold ? " I asked , shaking . " Not often , " my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not allow the firm surface of the hull to get out of my clasp for the remainder of the afternoon , not , that is , until later , when a piece of red-hot steel just skinned between me and the hull I was clinging to . It landed at my feet still glowing . I looked up at the men above me , who were preoccupied with the burning of a hole . " Never mind , darling , " the leaderman soothed . think they saw you . " But later I heard him berating these same burners . " You let a red-hot clip fall within an inch of her ? what the hell you trying to do ? " II pTRIIE next day Mr. Jepson sent me out to an assembly way where I was entered upon the foreman 's books as a shipfitter 's helper . Here are made the double bottoms which hold water and oil for the ship 's needs and for necessary ballast and , t suppose , give a second bottom when the first is missing . These units look much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wasps still crawling about chipping , marking , and welding . They are built up off the ground about five feet on skids of heavy timber and iron . I did not work that day : I met my new leaderman ? certainly a nice , decent young man , I was introduced about the skids to sober men who did not call me " darlin ' " or " duchess . " I was told just to hang around and try to catch on . This catching on was not easy . I saw no one figuring out the weight of a piece of angle iron with several unknowns nor estimating what the freeboard would be in Sacramento and San Francisco if its dimensions were such and such and such , as we had had to do in school . I saw a few thoughtful men studying blueprints ; a few shipfitters making chalk lines ; a great many welders ' arcs in the double-bottom units . But mainly I saw men trying to look not too bored with idleness ? the newly employed pacing back and forth slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toughened and inured to idleness , who now could stand quite still and lean against a piece of steel with extreme endurance for hours , relieved only by frequent intervals of cigarette smoking . I perceived I could join either of these two groups , but as I did not smoke and as I had read somewhere that once a prisoner had begun to pace his cell he was lost to hope , I chose a way of my own . I talked with everyone I could about the work and his reaction to it and tried to understand the whys and wherefores of this gigantic affair . I asked a pleasant-faced man who sat beside his burning machine how he liked his job . " Oh , fine , " he said , " when I have something to do . I like machine-burning a method of cutting the steel by fire but the only trouble is that there is so little of it to do on the skids . I cut that piece you sec there this morning but be lucky if there 's another job this afternoon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light my flame all day . " I asked the girl welder who seemed to be indefinitely standing by . " I like welding . But the waiting gets tiresome . There 's so little to do . " " The welders in the double bottom seem to be very busy . " " Yes , but you see I 've been assigned to this shipfitter as a tacker . He may not need me all day or only once or twice to tack a piece of steel but when he does I 've got to be on hand , you see . " An old man in a long black coat and felt hat had paced slowly back and forth all morning , his face shut against the world . I found he had come recently from a Missouri farm , and the silence of his farm , I thought , had settled into his facial muscles , making him taciturn and solitary . Another man with a jaunty largebrimmed hat was aching to talk . " I 'm from Minnesota and you can bet I 'm going back there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before that . They misrepresented things to us back there . They 're right about the high wages , but you ca n't get a room anywhere and the price of food is terrible . My son was all ready to come with me , but I came first to get started while he stayed to sell what lie could . I had n't been here two days until I telegraphed him not to come . And as soon as I 've stayed long enough to pay for my ticket here and back I 'm leaving . I have n't done a lick since I came anyway . " Late in the afternoon a shipfitter asked me to hold the end of his chalk line while he squared a piece of steel . The next day a shipfitter and a Hanger asked me to stand on a piece of steel while the Hanger shoved and pounded it into place . That was my work for two days . " Is n't there anything at all that I 'm supposed to be doing or am equal to doing ? " I put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why am I here ? " " Well , you 're absorbing something of it and by the time we need you you 'll know enough to help . Study the blueprints as much as you can . " " But is n't it expensive to pay me ninetyfive cents an hour to stand around ? How can we afford to build ships at such a cost ? " The foreman became calm and fatherly . " You have to figure it this way : At no matter what the cost , we have to have these ships . In a way you might figure they are beyond all cost . If these troopships we 're constructing make one safe trip across the ocean with troops and supplies they have served their purpose , have been worth their cost , whatever it is . " " But this does n't preclude the fact that I should be useful or not employed . I admit I am very new but ca n't I be taught ? If the shipfitters would just explain as they go along we 'd soon be more useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , you see this is a new field for us all here . " He glanced round . " I daresay there is n't a single man here who builds ships in peacetime . We 've come to it from all different fields . We 're groping at something new but we 're getting on our feet now . We 've corrected the templates patterns and smoothed it all out . From now on we 'll go faster and have more jobs for everyone . You just go on studying the blueprints . They 're essential . " And he patted my shoulder and turncd away . The young engineer whose job it is to supervise the units on the assemblies came by with a surprised but friendly look in his eyes . " What are you doing here ? " he asked . " I ask myself that . " He shrugged and smiled . " I go around all day asking myself that . What am I doing here ? " " But you have a good job . I watch you go around casting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which displeases you . Then a lot of people go to work fixing it up . " " Yes , but there 's not enough to it . It just takes an accurate eye . " I walked along the skids and bumped into a man in tan , apparently an engineer . We talked . " Tell me , " I asked , " Do you think I have misjudged my job ? Do you think if I keep trying I can find something to do ? " " Let me tell you , " he said . " I have degrees from four different universities . I helped build Singapore and Pearl Harbor . And I ca n't find a job for myself . " I took my problem to Mr. Jepson : " Ca n't you find a job with something for me to do ? " I asked him . " You 've got a job , have n't you ? ' " You mean I 've been employed . But I ca n't go on taking money for doing nothing . I 've got to respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day long they come in here wanting me to find them a job with more to do . What do you think I am ? I ca n't revolutionize the industry . What people do n't understand is that this is shipfitting . You ca n't build ships the way you do other things . " He spread out his arms . " There are times while the work is getting laid out when few people are needed but then , after it shapes up , everyone around , and more , can be thrown on it . There just has to be a period of lull . If this were a peacetime activity the boss would be around with more work than anyone could do , shouting , ' Get the hell on to the job . ' But by God , woman , this is war . What can you expect ? " Later my foreman , answering the same inquiry , said , " The management does employ more men and women than it can put to work at once but they are here on hand , taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starboard , bulkhead , and vertical keel . Some will drop out but eventually the others will be drawn in on the job . Some of those will be no good . The others will build ships . You 've got to have a lot of people to draw from in order to get even some good workmen . They shake the basket after a while and the capable come to the top . " " And the women ? " I asked . " And the women too have got to be used . The men do n't like the idea ; they voted against it in their unions ; but they 'll get used to women in time and think nothing of it . They used to feel the same way about women in the plate shop , but it 's full of women now ? they run the show ? and there 's no real hostility there toward them any more . Women have n't been seen much on ships yet but they 'll be seen as the war goes on . " I was glad he mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because there were no radio news reports here that no one spoke of the war , that great events shaping outside were diminished and pushed back from the consciousness of men . Was it because there were no clocks ? for never a one could you find in the yard ? that there seemed to be so little realization of the time that was so late ? It was hard indeed to remember the urgency of the voices on the air , my own struggle against a sense of guilt and conscience , and the compulsion that had finally brought me to this job I was not doing . Should I leave ? I remembered my husband 's and children 's absurd pride in my being here and decided to give myself two months to find something real to do . Within a week I had something of a job . I marked with yellow paint all the little places on the double bottom where the welders must put their intermittent weld . It was a sizable job which kept me busy all day in the double bottoms . I worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipefitters , and heaven help me , with chippers . ( " Chipper " is a mild understatement of a name for a man who grinds his way through steel with a drill or electric chisel which is as nerve-splintering as a dentist 's drill multiplied by a hundred . They seem to be nerveless and quite unconscious of the edginess they produce in others . ) The engineer told me very gently about the great art of marking for a welder ? never less than three inches and so much from center to center , to be gaged by the naked eye . The foreman of the welders happened upon the scene and told me not quite so sweetly but succinctly what to do and what not to do . The engineer disagreed with the welder ; the welder corrected the engineer ; and the conversation descended into a you-do-not-you-do-too sort of discussion . But they worked their way out of the unit with it and over to the office , and I took what seemed the best of both their arguments and made my yellow markings for the welders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fourthirty quitting whistle . When I came out of the unit with my paintbrush and can the day shift was gone and the swing shift was on . This was interesting , for I had wanted to see this shift for some time . On the " day " they were always saying " that damn swing shift " when they were n't saying " that damn graveyard shift . " It was frequently said that all that we , the day , did was undo what the other shifts had done wrong the night before . Therefore I was curious to see this group of people . They seemed quite normal , I thought , except that they continually stared at me as though I were a creature from another planetary system . I had to explain that I was a tag-end of the day shift . At that their wonder seemed to grow . " She belongs to the day shift " they repeated and shook their heads until I felt conspicuous and hurried away with yellow paint on my face . III r -- -iwo days later I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint , later on some prints , I painted a few letters on the steel , I studied the blueprints , and once in a while I held the end of a chalk line . But most of the time I sought work . I had learned that foremen and leadermen do not enjoy your asking for work . It 's embarrassing . They begin to get a harassed and haunted look . On my own initiative I labeled a few sections , numbered the frame lines of a unit , perceived no paint and went after it , made a few punch holes where needed , and simulated such activity that I had two women looking envious . " May I help you ? " one of them asked wistfully . I let her paint for a time while I learned about her . She had a husband and a son working in various shipyards of the bay area and no home but a garage . " I refused point-blank to stay home and keep house in a garage . So I came to work . It would be all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's standing around all day that is so hard . And it makes my son furious to hear of this idleness . He really works hard where he is and he thinks it gives all shipyards a bad name to hear what I tell him . " The other woman who watched me had been seven months in the shipyards , the first six of which she had been in the office , where she was responsible for the work of eight women . " By the time I got them enough to do there was nothing left for me . I decided to get outdoors where I could surely have more to do building ships . " She shrugged . " But it 's pretty much the same everywhere in the shipyards ? not enough to do . It 's all right for some people , who like something soft , but if you really want to work it 's awful . My husband got a leave of absence from his civil service position to work with me but he could n't stand it more than a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of my self-created jobs . I went back to my Ieaderman . " I 've kept out of your way for two and a half hours ; I 've been round and round the skids and I can find nothing else to do . I 'm afraid it 's up to you now . " His face lit up with an inspiration . " Take that cut over to First Aid , " he said . " Must I ? " I began , but then I saw it was his last resource . It would keep me busy going and coming . I had seen very little of First Aid . I had bought the insurance offered for fifty cents a week . I had seen the quiet coming and going of the ambulance as it was en route to and from the scene of accident . Someone might mention with a word or a gesture of his thumb that the ambulance was going by but there would be no herald of its movement in the yard . " Another one for Basin Three . " A piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them from his body , but there would be no outcry or fuss above the tumult of the assemblies . Or a man would fall and the ambulance would come silently and quickly , and as silently and quickly remove all traces of the tragedy , with no work stopped , few words said , no fuss made . In this , it seemed to mc , the yard was particularly efficient . The First-Aid building was a charming cottage , all white and gray and cool cleanliness . A line of human beings waited here as elsewhere in the yard . I joined the line . I recognized a woman welder in front of me . She was there for a hoarse cold . " Those awful double bottoms , " she said . " You get a cold in there and it hangs on for weeks . " " Aside from that , how do you like your job ? " " Well , some days I think I ca n't stand another day of it . Nothing seems worth the dirt and fumes and awful noise of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem so bad and I go on . " The nurses and office attendants of First Aid arc one group in the yard who are busy to a nerve-straining degree . As fast as they can ask or answer questions , or make notes , or hand out aspirin or nosedrops , they attend to the clients . Our attention was attracted by men in the row farther down . One man had stepped a little out of his straight line to talk to some acquaintance . A tall Negro stepped into his place . The white man did not speak before he swung a mighty fist at the Negro 's face and brought him down unconscious . He brushed his arms off and looked about him . " This was my place , " he said and stepped into it over the prone body of the Negro . His complacency seemed not to be touched by the fact that he had given the Negro a boost over himself and all the others into the inner sanctum of First Aid while he himself must wait in a line held up that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No Negro was going to step in front of him . During those days of enforced idleness I used to amuse myself by picking out those who were really working . I was surprised to count how many there were who were actually coming to grips with a job and seriously , soberly working it out without hurry but with no waste motion either . Shipfittcrs , fiangers , welders , burners , pipefitters , and chippers , experienced and wise in their calling , seemed conscious of the need for ships and were building them . The inexperienced like myself looked on . And not only the inexperienced . The leadermen of the various crafts seemed to find work irreconcilable with dignity . ( Surely I 've never seen any dignity like the dignity of a welder , burner , or chipper leaderman . ) This fine stillness in some may have made me unjust toward the class , but splendor does shine into the eyes at times and distort the view of the whole . Yet with these exceptions it seemed to me that people wanted to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or jealous of those who by luck or strategy had something to do . When there was a good piece of layout work ? the favorite job of shipfitters , it would seem ? we all pounced upon it like birds of prey and finished it up in no time . This was simply uncontrolled greed and we knew it . Sometimes two helpers , given a job and knowing it would be the only job for them that day , decided they would be thrifty and sparing of it to make it last all day . Or a job within one man 's capacity might in the spirit of co-operation be made to do for two or three , as when Alice and Pop and I snapped work lines one afternoon ? a job any one of us might have completed in the same time . ( " Do n't hurry now or we 'll be standing around looking at ourselves again . " ) There was some evidence that quartermasters , engineers , and superintendents realized this unhappy situation . It was drawn to their attention often enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Because some day you 'll be useful . " ) They must have dreamed at night of a scheme that would call for each assembly to employ all those who waited on its periphery in idleness . They even appointed intelligentlooking co-ordinators to figure out how everyone could be put to work ? and then the co-ordinators would go all about the skids , thoughtful and wistful , trying to find a job for themselves . IV NT must have been a fortnight or so later that I was given my first real shipfitting job . ( Painting for welders is hardly that . ) I was taught to put chocks on the double bottom . Chocks act as supports when the unit is turned over and put into the waiting hull . For weeks the craftsmen of our skids had worked on a huge section of double bottom , labeled XAK , which was at last passed as finished . It was prepared by the riggers to be lifted by the cranes ? and then the whistle blew MAGAZINE and we all went home . In the morning we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? on the graveyard shift , mind you ? the great weight suddenly broke loose and dropped , breaking a crane , smashing the roadway and concrete walk , and quite ruining the unit itself . If the work in the basin on Hull 6 was not to he held up we had to rush a new XAK to replace the other . All hands were thrown upon it ? even my hands . I was told to locate the chocks on the blueprint , to measure for them , to find the chocks , to get a welder to put them on , and to check to see that they were square . It was nice to be a part of the co-operative spirit that was humming over this great smoking honeycomb . Men crawled in and out as furiously busy as wasps . I went my way blithely , saying " Ah-h-h " to myself . When it came to getting a welder , why , I knew welders . They were clothed in brown leather and wore black helmets . Dozens of them were about . I approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chocks on , over here ? They are in a hurry for the unit . " The welder looked at the project and drew back coldly . " That 's a job for a tacker , " he said . " It 's welding , is n't it ? " " Tacking is a temporary weld . You 'll have to get a tacker . " I went up to the next brown-leathered man . " I have n't my hose over on this side . It would be too much trouble to haul it over for just those few chocks . " I approached another welder , who tried to crush me with a look . " I 'm a welder , not a tacker . " I selected next a tall masterly-looking man of much dignity . " There are a few chocks which must be tacked in unit XAK . Can you do it ? The unit is supposed to go right away . " Heavens , what had I done now ? This man looked at me , just looked at me , while he blew out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he spoke these few concentrated words : " I am a tacker leaden-clan . " I wondered if I was supposed to back away bowing . This was getting me nowhere . And this was my job . I looked about the skids until I recognised a welding foreman . I took ray case to him . More experienced now , I did not ask him to weld but only to obtain a welder-tacker for me . He produced a very young boy whom I led to my chocks . I made them square and on my lines before he welded . When he finished they were neither square nor on my lines . They had to be broken off and rewelded . They were not his responsibility . But I felt sorry for him ? not so many years older than my children , and earning ninety-five cents an hour before he had lived long enough to know what that meant or the importance of the education he was not getting . When he had welded three or four chocks he stood up with his eyes wandering all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more because be ought to be with another crew and besides , he did n't think his hose would reach much farther . Then I looked about the assembly myself . I found a tall young woman standing with her tools and hose with that baffled look of the newly idle . I approached her . " I do n't know whether you 're a tacker or a welder or a helper or a trainee or a journeyman , but there are a few chocks which must be welded to unit XAK before it is picked up by the riggers . Do you think you can do it ? " " You bet I can . I 'd love to , " she said and was on her way at once . " I have n't done a thing all day . " I was surprised how quickly and efficiently she gathered her paraphernalia and stooped over the job . When she raised her helmet the chocks were on the lines and square . She was interested to know where they should go and she took the responsibility for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hold them or look at them , " she told me . " You might burn your arm or get a flash . I 'll hold them to the mark . " After she had finished she told me that this was her second day out of welding school . " My husband was called into the Army and I went into welding school . If there 's anything I can do to help build ships I 'm going to do it . " I could well believe what was so frequently said in the Yard : that women make fine welders . A few mornings later , as soon as we stepped upon the skids , we perceived that something new was astir . The shipfitting women there were three of us ? were called together . " We 're going to give you your own unit to work on together , " the leaderman said . " XAK is your baby now . Study your print , square your frame lines down the vertical keel , and get the crane to bring you your steel . " Alice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Golly , " she said . " Really ? " The colored girl was more sophisticated but we were all pleased . " Let 's be so accurate and careful that they wo n't he able to find a thing wrong . Let 's check and recheck everything . . . . " " We 'll work it out together . If one of us makes a mistake we 'll tell her and correct it and no bad feelings . . . . " " We 'll all stand and fall together on it . " That was the way we talked . I never saw such a change in three workmen as in these three girls . We became integrated persons working together on a project which focused all our interests . I noticed how quickly we ran our own errands , how conscientious we were in checking , how we abhorred sloppy measurements . For once we had been given responsibility , for once we had been put on our own , for once we had enough to do . " When we finish we 'll hold open house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our le aderman . Our enjoyment was such that we did not notice that something was amiss until late in the afternoon . Then we became gradually aware of the hostility of the men . Our woman burner reported that they were " seething with resentment " that women should be given a unit to construct . The women checkers said , " You should just hear what we hear outside our checking shed , my dears . " This was the first time I had come up against the hostility of one se : toward another and I could not believe it . The men had always been so decent , so respectful , so kindly . But this was the first time that we had been seen in the light of competitors . We had been amusing little creatures only too happy to take what crumbs of jobs were dropped to us . Our leaderman said , " I know , but pay no attention . They 'll have to get used to women shipfitters . Half these men may be in the Army this January . They might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take their places . " Our woman checker said , " In September I was one of the first women ever to be admitted out here in the yards . You could have cut the resentment with a knife and spread it thick . But it 's gradually being worn away . " The next day , with no explanation , our XAK , " our baby , " was taken from us and given to the men . We had to stand aside and see the men working on what we felt was our project . Cora , whose boy friend was one of the group , said the men were afraid the assemblies would become like the plate shop ? overrun by women . She took herself over to the unit where her friend was working , to lean against the steel . Alice took out her lipstick : " Oh , what the heck do I care so long as I get my dollar five an hour . But it was fun . " I tried to reflect that there must be another side to this thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take care of several dependents . and who had known the bitter struggle for a living ? maybe these men resented the fact that any eighteen-year-old could come out without a day 's training , without a grain of tool sense or mechanical sense , and draw the same pay as they and rise at the same rate ? even these girls who would go at once into debt for fur coats and " perfectly adorable " evening gowns . The pay was too high for the beginner , 1 knew ? for the boy who had quit high school as well as for the girl . The experienced workman might easily feel resentment . But this I knew too : that the responsibility placed upon these girls had made them almost in one day into serious workmen . V O NE night I had an adventure . It concerned my getting home . Tired of having my hammer stolen so many times , I had brought a cheap little hammer from home and kept it in a little leather holder on my belt ( a Christmas gift from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate , a little late , I was held up by a guard . " Sorry , lady , you ca n't go out with that hammer . Step back . " " This ? " I asked and brought the hammer forth . " But it is my own from home . " " Sorry , but you 'll have to go to the police station . " " Where is the police station ? " He gave me the direction with his thumb . " But I 'll miss my last bus . " " There 'll be others later on . " " Not for fifty or sixty minutes later on , and then perhaps not in my direction . " At the police station : " You ca n't go home with that . " " It 's my own . " " But you ca n't go out the gate with it . " " I have for two weeks . " " You ca n't any more . 3/ " Will you check it for me then and let me catch my bus ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way back to the plate shop and let them release it . " ? " That is blocks and blocks back . The plate shop has nothing to do with this ? they 've never seen it . Ca n't I leave it with you and go out the gale ? " " No . " " But you 'll have the hammer . " " We do n't want the hammer . " " Do you mean to say you are going to keep me here for a twenty-five-cent hammer , without a warrant ? " I looked at the three uniformed policemen , at the heavy galvanized fencing , at the guarded gate , and shook myself . This was like some movie I had seen of Nazi Germany . " I insist upon seeing the American Consul . " But they did n't smile . " May I use the phone then ? " " No . " By this time I had a splitting headache ; I was furious ; I was longing to reach my husband and have him come in true movie fashion to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an ashcan near by and approached the gate . The guard stood stiffly and stoutly before me . " Where 's your release ? " " I have n't one but I have n't a hammer either ? see ? " and I showed him . " You 'll stay here all night then . " I turned and began my furious walk to the plate shop . Often in the yard I had seen people pushed round and marveled with a tittle disgust that Americans would take it . I had often seen utter disregard for individual liberty and great injustice done to employees , and had noticed that it was taken with pained resignation by some , and by others with apathy , with whining complaint , or with " My God , someone is going to hear of this ! " But for the Resigned , the Apathetic , the Plaintive , the Angry the situation remained unchanged . Now I understood . The plate shop seemed puzzled by my request ; it was evident they had not often had to meet such a demand . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me ; they shook their heads , for I was a suspect character . Finally a checker brought a man in charge who produced , after a time , a form which stated that the tool chest which this workman was carrying out of the yard contained no plate-shop tools . The employee at his elbow said , " For a two-bit hammer , my God ! " I walked the blocks back to the gate , noting when I arrived that all busses had disappeared . I presented my piece of paper to the guard , who stepped aside and allowed me to pass . I clicked my heels and saluted . " Heil , " I said . But he did not smile or speak , for he was a serious man and I had tried him greatly . I now realized I worked for something Big . I was deeply impressed all the way home . VI HAD promised myself two months in which to find myself here in the shipyards but my probation was not to last so long . It seemed that we , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a while we had floated on top , undissolved , but the broth was big enough with a little stirring and stewing to absorb us all ? or almost all . The great need was for experienced workmen , men or women ; and time on the job , doing this and a little of that , adds up finally to experience . I was given more and more to do . ( When I told my leaderman that I liked having more to do he answered , " Well , neither you nor I nor the shipyards are as new and green as we were ; we 're all getting under way . " ) Six weeks from the date of my arrival at the yard I was given a unit to handle by myself . I guess it was not so much but it was my own . I measured for and located the steel material which was to go on this unit . I labeled it with chalk and engaged the riggers to lift it . I asked a hanger and a tacker to be on hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weld ) it up . And then I stood while the crane ? one of those beautiful gray cranes which trail steel through the air with a motion as graceful as the soaring of a hawk on an upcurrent of air ? picked up the material and sped it to our unit . It was n't so much , no more than anyone could have done , but I felt the keen exhilaration of getting under way . It was good , I thought , this working together on a ship . Standing so elated , I felt a ripple of interest run from workman to workman . We all looked up and out to sea where a gray troopship was being towed past us silently . Our ship . My first day in the yard I had helped make a scupper for it and these other men and women standing grinning had made the double bottom . " There she goes ! " we said and watched it as it slipped away . Then I turned back to my work , for at last I had a job .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
