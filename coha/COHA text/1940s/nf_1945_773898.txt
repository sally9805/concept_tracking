Morgan and Hall offer a summary ( Table 27 ) of the effect of cook-ing conditions on the various vegetable pigments . EFFECT OF COOKERY ON FLAVOR . The effect of cooking on the taste of vegetables depends upon the character of the substances responsible for the flavoring . Some of these substances arc highly volatile , readily driven off by heat ; others are water soluble and are dissolved in the cooking liquid , which if not conserved and incorporated in the dish will lead to their loss . Still other substances , not objectionable in themselves , such as those in cabbage , may upon the application of heat break down , yield-ing hydrogen sulphide and other strong-flavored , unpalatable compounds . In a few foods volatility is an asset . For example , onions on heating lose // allyl sulphide , the objectionable compound responsible for the character-istic odor left on the breath and skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large quantity of water may free them from a high percentage of this substance . In general the following practices are approved as desirable for con-serving the flavor of vegetables : shortening the cooking period as far as is compatible with tenderness ; using the steamer for vegetables that have a mild flavor and those which do not contain chlorophyll , such as carrots , potatoes , and parsnips ; and cooking green vegetables and those with strong flavor , such as broccoli , Brussels sprouts , cabbage and turnips , in water on top of the stove or in a steam-jacketed kettle . Other factors that are believed to influence the effect of cooking are the hardness of the water and the presence of salt . The use of hard water in cooking may have an undesirable effect on the product . Cal-cium and magnesium dissolved in the water may combine with the cellu-lose , thus hardening the structure of the food . The addition of salt either at the beginning or at least early in the cooking period is regarded as important in developing and maintaining a good flavor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vary with the kind of vegetable and the amount of water used ; proportionately smaller amounts of salt are suit-able for mild-flavored than for strong-flavored vegetables . In cooking // any vegetable just enough salt should be used to obviate the need of more salt before serving , but not enough to cause an objectionable flavor . Salt is usually added in proportion to the amount of water , rather than di-rectly to the quantity of vegetable being cooked . The use of 1 to 21/2 tea-spoons of salt to each quart of water is advocated by Halliday and Nobler ? The effect of the use of salted water on calcium losses during cooking is debated . Some studies 2 ? seem to indicate that under house-hold conditions of preparation the loss of calcium in such vegetables as asparagus , green beans , cabbage , carrots , peas , potatoes , and turnips is practically the same whether or not salt is added to the cooking water . REVIEW OF PRELIMINARY PREPARATION AND BASIC COOKERY PRINCIPLES OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES Preliminary Preparation . Fruits an4l vegetables should be handled as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its location in line with the cooking unit help to prevent undue handling . Minimum equipment for this area includes one or two double-compartment sinks with drain boards at either end , two worktables , scales , a vegetable peeler , containers for prepared foods , cut-ting board 's , and paring , French , and slicing knives . A refrigerator should be within easy access . More sinks and worktables , refrigerators , mechanical slicers and dicers , or special knives and cutters may be added as needed . FRUITS . Certain procedures in the preparation of fruits are more or less standard but are not always applicable to every institutional situation . The following meth-ods have been found desirable in the preliminary preparation of fruits . All fruits should be washed to remove surface soil , sprays , and preservatives ( such as wax on apples ) before they are served raw or incorporated into made dishes . Fruits are left whole or cut into segments of size or shape suitable for the purpose . For example , a fresh pear would be washed and served whole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dessert . Most raw fruits are prepared as late as possible before serving and then returned to the refrigerator until mealtime . Apples to be served raw in a salad or dessert are selected on the basis of flavor and texture rather than size . Some varieties , such as Ben Davis and Gano , are too flavorless to be satisfactory ; others , such as Grimes Golden , have a texture not well adapted to fruit combinations . Jonathan , Wincsap , Wealthy , Spitzenberg , Rome Beauty , Baldwin , Greening , and Delicious are desirable varieties for salads . Their preparation usually includes peeling , removal of bruises and spots , coring , and dicing . The highly colored skins of these varieties make it preferable to leave the skin on at times . Peeling is sometimes clone by hand , and removal of bruises // and spots is included in the operation . This process is time consuming and has in many institutions been partially replaced by efficient mechanical apple peelers . If the mechanical peeler is used , bruises and spots must still be removed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hand corer . A rapid and satisfactory procedure for dicing is to remove the core , peel if desired , slice into rings , stack on a slicing board , and complete the dicing with the use of the sectional cutter . To prevent discoloration due to the action of an oxidase , the diced pieces are dropped into a bowl containing lemon juice and water , pineapple juice , other acid fruit juice , or salad dressing . Salted water is sometimes used for apples if they are to be made into salad or cooked within a short time . Crisp white apple segments are essential to the attractiveness of the salad in which they are an ingredient . When ready for combination with other fruits or with vegetables , the pieces should be well defined and uniform in size and shape . Apples for baking are washed , cored , and placed in baking pans . The core is removed from the stem end . Care should be taken not to cut through the blossom , as the cavity will be filled with sugar , sirup , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through into the water . Buttered apples are most rapidly prepared by cutting the washed and unpeeled apples into quarters on a board , removing the cores , and dropping the pieces directly into the pans in which they will be steamed and baked . Apricots , cherries , grapes , pears , and plums are most often washed in a colander , dried between two towels , and served whole without further preparation as desserts or cut and used in salads . Berries , because of their structure and high water content , lose their form too quickly to make them a desirable salad fruit although they are often used as a garnish and are popular as desserts . Bananas are usually limited in type and size to those available on the local market . They should be used at just the right degree of ripeness , for when underripe they are unpalatable and discolor rapidly and when overripe they are soft and unattractive . Their tendency to darken , owing to action of an oxidase , makes it necessary that little time elapse between their preparation and service unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bananas may be prepared successfully in quantity for the institutional menu if they are immersed in a solution of cream of tartar and Karo sirup , or cerelose . This solution prevents discoloration , preserves the firmness , and does not affect the flavor of the fruit . Certain fruit juices are of approximately the same acidity and are of the same density as the solution used in the experiment and so may be used most effectively for this purpose , especially in the preparation of bananas for salads and fruit cup . Cut bananas so treated may be kept several hours without discoloring . The availability of bananas in all seasons , their fairly constant and relatively moderate cost , their nutritive value , and ease of preparation all encourage their wide use in fruit mixtures and salads . The recent development and increased production of avocados have placed them among the common salad fruits . They are no longer prohibitive in price , they are generally available , and their use is not limited to salads alone . Experts have so perfected the fruit that it now has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes as high as 28 per cent . The oil makes for much better keeping qualities than those of the earlier avocado of lower oil content . As a salad // food the avocado is served in the half shell , quarter shell , diced , or sliced , and usually with French dressing or lemon juice . Attractive and pleasing combinations of avocados with grapefruit , oranges , tomatoes , peppers , asparagus , and other corn mon salad ingredients may be made . Oranges and grapefruit are often served in halves , fresh or broiled , for breakfast fruits or desserts . These fruits should first be cut in half , crosswise . Each seg ment should then be cut around with a grapefruit knife , care being taken not to cut the membranes between segments . It is desirable to work in a clockwise direction , turning the fruit as necessary . The core should be cut out with a pair of scissors . Both oranges and grapefruit are used extensively in either the sections character istic of these fruits or in cubes or slices . The points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membrane should be carefully removed and that the segments should emerge uniform in size and contour , with clean-cut edges and no appearance of mushiness . It has been found that oranges , sizes 150 or 125 , and grapefruit , sizes 96 or 80 , are advantageously used for salads and that their sections combine well . Oranges and grapefruit are peeled by cutting a thick layer off both the top and the bottom of the fruit to a depth great enough to expose the pulp . The fruit is then placed on a cutting board and peeled down the sides from end to end . Care should be taken to follow the contour of the fruit and to cut only deep enough to remove all white membrane . Peeling around the fruit in counterclockwise direction permits the worker to see what she is doing . When the fruit is entirely exposed it is possible to follow the line of the membranes making the sections . With a sharp knife cut along the membrane of a section to the center of the fruit , then turn the knife and force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out to the exterior of the fruit . This cutting process produces a section of fruit , with clean-cut edges . The process must be repeated for each section . Some cooks prefer to peel a citrus fruit by holding it in the left hand and cutting around it . Cantaloups and other melons are used in season . Though less commonly used in salads than many other fruits they add interest , color , and variety , often being cut into shapes such as balls or wedges . Since peaches discolor rapidly when exposed to air , they must be prepared as quickly and as late as possible . This may he effectively accomplished by placing them in a perforated basket or colander and lowering it into boiling water . Instead they may be cooked in the pressure steam cooker for approximately two minutes or until the skin will slip . Then plunge them into cold water . The skins should peel off easily and the fruit be unharmed by the sudden heating and chilling . To slice rapidly , the peeled peach should be turned in the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( stainless-steel blade ) and using a rapid chopping motion with the right hand . The cut wedges may be pushed off the pit with the thumb of the left hand while the right hand continues to hold the knife and picks up another peach . VEGETABLES . Commonly eaten vegetables , selected on the basis of both popu larity and availability , include the following : potatoes , peas , lettuce , string beans , tomatoes , carrots , cabbage , cauliflower , beets , celery , onions , asparagus , spinach , broccoli , and turnips . In their preparation the following methods are usually employed : // 1 . All leafy and stem vegetables are washed thoroughly and crisped before they are used raw as relishes or salads or are cooked . 2 . Root and tuber vegetables put through a vegetable peeler are not usually washed prior to this procedure . 3 . Vegetables to be cooked unpeeled may be scrubbed well with a stiff brush . Root and tuber vegetables , such as carrots and potatoes , are pared for approximately two minutes in an electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar size peeled in one lot . The length of time required depends upon the size of the vegetables , the number put into the peeler at one time , and their condition . Not more than 15 to 20 pounds should be peeled in one lot , as the larger the amount the longer the time required and the greater waste . The peeled potatoes or carrots are placed in large containers of clean cold water and then trimmed and cut by hand . Less fatigue and greater speed will be evinced by the worker if he holds the paring knife loosely in the right hand and cuts into the potato as it is pushed downwards and toward the center in the left hand . With practice this procedure becomes rhythmic and almost automatic . Carrots may be trimmed with the same motions . After all the vegetables have been trimmed , a French knife and cutting board may be used to cut the desired shapes and sizes . Asparagus and broccoli should be inspected , the wilted and decayed sections removed , the hard , tough parts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughly . The vegetable may be tied in bundles of one to two pounds each , each bundle being the equivalent of six servings , as a preparation for easy handling in cooking in water . This bunching permits placement of the stalks with the tender tips or heads up , so that they need not be submerged in the cooking water and hence overcooked . If the vegetable is to be cooked in the steamer , the washed pieces should be laid not more than two inches deep in the pans from which they will be served . In the preparation of cauliflower the leaves are removed except for a few of the smallest , and dark spots are cut away . If the head is to be served whole no further cutting is necessary . If the head is to be used in pieces , the flowerets are separated from the core , a stem about one inch long being left on each . In either method it is advisable to soak the cauliflower as well as broccoli and artichokes in water to which vinegar or salt has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a gallon of water or 11/2 tablespoons of salt to a gallon of water . Greens , including lettuce , romaine , endive , water cress , spinach , and similar leaf vegetables , require special care . In preparing head lettuce the heavy outside leaves are removed and discarded , the stem end or core is cut out about one inch , and the head is held with the cavity under running cold water until the leaves are loosened . The head is then turned right side up to drain , and in a short time it is practically free from excess water . The leaves are separated and stacked or nested , six or eight leaves to a pile . Each pile is inverted , packed in a container , and covered with a fitted lid or damp cloth . The container is placed in the refrigerator for two or more hours to complete the crisping . With such loose-leafed greens as leaf lettuce , water cress , endive , romaine , mint , spinach , and dandelion , and such other vegetables as cauliflower and artichokes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its preparation for cooking . After this treatment the product may be washed in clear water , packed in a container , covered with a ' fitted lid or damp cloth , and placed // in the refrigerator for further crisping . Water cress and parsley are regarded as capable of remaining in prime condition through a longer period after crisping than the other salad greens discussed . Celery too holds up well after crisping . In the preparation of celery for use in shredded form several stalks may be laid on a board , cut simultaneously , and added to the salad mixture without further handling . Lettuce , cabbage , and spinach are often shredded to add to the attractiveness and variety of the salad . The leaves are formed into a firm roll , placed on a board , and laterally sliced with a sharp knife or held in the hand and cut with scissors . The shredding should be done just before the salad is to be combined . Tomatoes to be used in salads should be peeled . Unfortunately there are times when the tomatoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit this treatment . Then the use of fresh tomatoes should be discouraged . Tomatoes may be peeled in either of two ways : 1 . The tomato may be placed on a fork , rotated in a clear gas flame or over glowing coals until the skin begins to crack , and then plunged in cold water . The skin is then removed . 2 . The tomatoes may be placed in a colander or wire basket , dipped in boiling water or placed in the steamer until the skins begin to loosen , then dipped in cold water to cool . The skins may then be readily removed . In any method the procedure should be conducted as rapidly as possible to prevent cooking . After being dipped in cold water the tomatoes may be placed in a covered container in the refrigerator and peeled later as needed . This will prevent the possibility of deterioration through long standing after peeling . Green peppers require little preliminary treatment beyond washing and the removal of seeds and stem . The peppers are then cut into the desired shapes . Cucumbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After brief soaking they are crisped in the refrigerator to the desired state of freshness . Usually the time that elapses between the removal of tomatoes , peppers , and cucumbers from the refrigerator and their appearance in a salad is relatively brief . Beets are usually washed and cooked , the skins removed , and blemishes or spots cut out . Instead they may be prepared in the same manner as carrots and potatoes . Turnips are topped and then may be peeled by hand or in the vegetable peeler . The electric peeler removes the skins of turnips in about four minutes but tends to produce a soft , spongy product . Since rutabagas are usually waxed , they should be peeled by hand with a French knife and cutting hoard . Onions are prepared somewhat differently , the layer structure of the bulb making the use of the electric peeler impossible . 1 lot water may be poured over the onions in lots of 5 pounds or whatever other amount is easy to handle . Wilted leaves , the outer layer of the bulb , the firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed under water . The bulbs are then sliced or cut as desired . All strings and blemishes are removed from string beans by hand , and they are then washed and cut as desired . There seems to be no standard procedure for stringing beans . If the beans are of uniform length , several may be held in the left hand on a cutting board and the ends removed with one stroke of a French knife . The more usual method is to pick up in the right hand one bean at a time by the end and transfer it to the left hand , simultaneously breaking off the end by which the bean was held . As soon as the bean is in the left hand , the second end is broken off by the right hand in an upward swing motion , then the process is repeated . Several beans can be held in the left hand and dropped // regularly into a container at the same time the right hand is lowered to pick up another bean . Much speed can be developed through such coordinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelled by hand . If the pods are tough , they may be blanched to facilitate shelling . A pea sheller that shortens the process is now on the market and is being introduced into many institutional kitchens . The preliminary preparation of celery includes separating the outer stalks from the heart of the bunch , washing with a brush , trimming , and removing the bruised and blemished parts . Further cutting may be done as desired . In the preparation of celery for use in shredded form , several stalks may be laid on a board across the cooking pan , cut at once , and dropped into the pan or added to the salad mixture without further handling . The preparation of cabbage is far more simple than that of other leafy vegetables . The outer leaves are removed , and each head is then washed and cut into four or six pieces , depending upon its size , by using a French knife and cutting board . The center stalk is removed from each piece in like manner . The edible portion remaining is then cut or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attachment on the power mixer if a finely cut product is desired . Spinach is prepared by removing the crown and all the petiole , if it is large and coarse . The leaves are carefully examined , and all dry , yellow , wilted , or slimy ones are discarded . The leaves and small tender sterns regarded as forming the edible portion are cut or pulled from the sterns and washed four or five times or even more , if necessary , to free them from bugs , sand , and other soil . The preparation of kale and other greens is similar to that of spinach . Basic Cookery Principles . 1 . The natural ' color , texture , and flavor of the fruit or vegetable should be retained or enhanced by the cookery process . 2 . The food value of the fruit or vegetable should be conserved . Losses of volatile substances during cooking , of food constituents dissolved in the water used in preparation and then discarded , and of substances destroyed by heat must be guarded against . 3 . The cooking medium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hot air , affects the characteristics of the finished product , including its nutritive value . 4 . The temperature and the length of time used in cooking each fruit or vegetable influence 1 , 2 , and 3 above , and should be maintained at points that will insure optimum condition of product . 5 . Combinations of one fruit with another or of one vegetable with others , or the addition of other foods as custards , and sauces , arc desirable only in so far as pleasing contrasts in color , texture , and flavor that may add to the variety and interest of a meal are produced . 6 . Frozen fruits and vegetables with the exception of corn on the cob are cooked without prethawing . Prethawing is necessary for corn on the cob to prevent excessive cooking of the kernels while the heat is penetrating the cob . Either boiling or steaming may be used , boiling being recommended for such vegetables as asparagus , cauliflower , and spinach , and steaming for peas , cut corn , and corn on the cob ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as navy , Lima , pinto , soy , and kidney beans , peas , and lentils , restoration of the water content to that of the fresh legume before cooking is started helps to shorten the cooking time . Legumes will absorb enough water approximately to double their dry weight , with an attendant increase in // volume . The length of the soaking period depends upon the temperature at which it is carried on ; the use of warm water usually cuts the soaking time by about one-half , just as soaking in turn tends to shorten the cooking time . 8 . The use of hard water containing calcium and magnesium salts is undesirable in cooking legumes , as such water has a hardening effect on the vegetable . 9 . Dehydrated fruits and vegetables require " refreshing " to restore their original water content and thus make them plump and tender . The water needed may be in the ratio of 3 to 1 by weight for pulpy or starchy foods and 6 or 8 to 1 for leafy vegetables . Application to Institutional Cookery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooked in sequence so as to ensure readiness to serve at regular intervals . One cafeteria feeding 4,000 patrons at noon cooks vegetables in quantities sufficient to replenish the serving units as needed . Thus the cooking of vegetables becomes a continuous process , and the quantity prepared at any one time does not exceed that found to yield a desirable product . All patrons are assured of freshly cooked vegetables , palatable and nutritious . Relatively few studies have been made concerning the most desirable methods and length of cooking for vegetables prepared in larger quantities than are required in home cookery or even of the quantity that can be successfully prepared at one time . The lack of experimental work of this kind is reflected in practices of institutional kitchens . A survey of the vegetable cookery procedures followed in several institutions well known for their good food indicates a lack of agreement disconcerting except when the wide differences in the number of persons to be fed , the type of service , and the available equipment and labor are taken into consideration . The quality of the vegetables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of green beans , and the type of preliminary preparation , as in whole or diced turnips , also affect the method of cookery and the length of the cooking period . There is evident a general shift from cooking large quantities of all vegetables under steam pressure , a practice common a decade ago , to cooking many vegetables in steam-jacketed kettles . This type of cookery is especially desirable if a large quantity of vegetables must be cooked at one time to serve several hundred persons at once , as is the common practice in large residence halls . Some commercial food services use batteries of small steam-jacketed kettles for cooking vegetables and find them entirely satisfactory in the production of high-quality products . As was previously stated , pressure cookery is regarded as satisfactory for sweet-juiced tubers and roots , such as potatoes , carrots , and parsnips . It is also suitable for other vegetables if they are cooked in small quantities , arranged in thin layers not more than two inches deep in shallow pans so that the cooking time may be brief . ( See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cookers to regulate this part of the process . Regardless of the procedure followed , almost every institution report-ing stressed the danger of overcooking and the need for constant check-ing of the effect of the procedure used on the vegetables . Only by this means was it deemed possible to maintain satisfactory standards in vege-table cookery . Table 28 has been compiled from data submitted by directors of sev-eral food services in which the cookery of vegetables in quantity is highly satisfactory . Dehydrated vegetables , unless powdered or sliced very thin , need to be " refreshed , " that is , to have their water content restored before cooking . Otherwise , the product may remain tough and leathery . The amount of water required for refreshing varies somewhat , but it is suggested that for carbohydrate-rich foods , such as peas , corn and potatoes , the quantity needed is in the ratio of 3 fluid ounces of water to every ounce by weight of the dried product . For water-rich vegetables , such as spinach and cabbage , the amount needed for refreshing is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each ounce by weight of the dried product . The // refreshing period is tentatively designated as 12 hours or over night , although recent reports point toward a shorter period . Powdered , thinly sliced , or shredded vegetables that have been heavily blanched prior to dehydration may be cooked without preliminary soaking . Cooking in steam is strongly recommended for dehydrated vegetables , as it does away with the danger of scorching , which seems heightened in these foods . Tentative suggested cooking times for refreshed dehyAPPLICATION // drated vegetables are 30 minutes of steaming for peas , potatoes , and corn , and 60 minutes for most others.Z " If these foods are cooked on top of the stove the process should be slow . Attention is called to the loss of some delicate flavors of the fresh vege-table during dehydration and the resulting need for the use of seasoning and condiments during cooking . Butter , bacon , ham , tomato sauce , onion , garlic , mace , basil , and bay arc among the popular seasonings // added to enhance the flavor of certain dehydrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Individual taste is perhaps the largest de termining factor in the choice made . Service . The problem of satisfactory vegetable service is particularly difficult for such food units as hotel dining rooms , tearooms , and cafe terias in which the serving period extends over three or more hours and there is no assurance about the number to be served at any one time . The prominence of the steam table at the cafeteria counter and in the hospital and other institutional kitchens gives some force to the state ment , " No matter how they are cooked , institutionally prepared vege tables will be poor when served . " It is easy to undo all the advantages gained by a shortened period and a desirable method of cooking by con tinuing the application of heat on the steam table or a bain-marie for a period of time equal to that spent in cooking or longer . Keeping cooked fresh vegetables on the steam table for several hours before they are served is a procedure destructive to color , vitamin content , and palata bility . The cook who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect his products to be judged satisfactory by his noon-day clientele . MacGibbon and Halliday found significant color changes in asparagus , beans , and broccoli when held on the steam table for varying lengths of time . The results of this study are shown in Table 29 . Food services which recognize the importance of good food keep their steam table a point of service , rather than a place of storage , by cooking vegetables in such small quantities that the steam counter is continually replenished with freshly cooked food . To emphasize the importance and provide indices of properly cooked vegetables for persons participating in quantity food preparation , Form 9 is suggested for routine use . CHAPTER V MILK AND OTHER DAIRY PRODUCTS - Milk . Milk plays an important part in the American diet . It is served as a beverage at least once a day in the planned diets of the ma jority of people . Milk is a particularly important item in school lunch-rooms , which tend to feature it and often plan to serve one-half pint a meal for each child as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooking . Sedgwick reports that in one series of state-supported hospitals the per capita daily allowance of milk as a beverage ( three meals ) is 13 ounces and for cooking , 3 ounces , making a total of 16 ounces per day per person . ' COMPOSITION . Milk is found to contain all substances essential to good nutrition but not all of them in significant amounts . For example , the protein in milk , which includes casein , lactalbumin , and lactoglobulin , is complete and readily assimilable ; the fat is palatable and digestible . As a source of calcium , phosphorus , and the vitamins thiamine , niacin , and riboflavin , milk is an important part of the daily food supply . The vita-min A and D content has been found to vary with the food given the cow . Milk is low in iron , and its content of vitamin C is relatively low . SELECTION . Sanitary laws regulating the composition of milk and its production , when properly enforced , afford protection to the consumer . Grades have been established for milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be overlooked by the institutional buyer . The Public Health Service Milk Ordinance and Code , ' which has now been adopted by approximately 1,000 American communities , establishes grades for both raw and pasteurized milk , although the Public Health Service , like most health authorities , believes that any milk which has not been prop erly pasteurized commercially should be pasteurized or boiled in the in stitution or the home before it is consumed . The United States Public Health Code , although available for general acceptance , is in force only in towns and cities which adopt it . In some // cases legislation based on this code but not identical with it has been accepted . The director of a food service should be informed concerning the legal specifications in her vicinity and should know the ratings given the various agencies that contribute to the local milk supply so that possible necessary shifts in milk source may be made without jeopardy . Raw milk which has been produced under sanitary conditions , including regular inspection of the herd , and which has a bacterial count of less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and may be safely used in its natural state . The prohibitive cost of this grade of milk has led to the use of raw or pasteurized grade A milk in most institutions . The margin of safety is so much greater in the pasteurized milk than in the raw milks , other than the certified , however , that common institutional practice , required by law in many states , is the use of only pasteurized milk . The grades of raw milk are based upon compliance with some twentysix individual items of sanitation at the producing farm and upon the bacterial content of the milk . All the factors known to have a bearing upon the safety and wholesomeness of milk , such as the health of cows , clean , sanitary equipment of proper design , clean , healthy employees , the bacterial count , sanitary methods of production , the control of flies , and the use of a pure water supply are considered in the grading of milk under the provision of the United States Public Health Service Ordinance and Code . When the ordinance is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these requirements is permitted to be labeled grade A raw milk . The bacterial count of such milk must not exceed 50,000 per cubic centimeter . Farms producing pasteurized milk are subject to the same type of inspection . In addition , the milk must be pasteurized in a plant so constructed and operated as to comply with all the requirements of the Public Health Service Ordinance . The pasteurization process consists of heating every particle of milk to a temperature of not less than 142 ? F. for not less than 30 minutes or to a temperature of not less than 160 ? F. for 15 seconds in approved and properly operated equipment . This treatment is not designed to make good milk out of poor milk , but it will insure the safety of the product . Grade A milk for pasteurization may have a bacterial count of not more than 200,000 ; after pasteurization the count may not exceed 50,000 . Institutional buyers should insist on the delivery of grade A pasteurized milk as provided for in the Public Health Service Milk Ordinance and Code whenever it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as extensively in institutional cookery as its high nutritive value and low cost justify . It differs from // whole milk only in that its fat content has been greatly reduced . Otherwise its nutrients are the same as those of whole milk . Wide production of safe skim milk has been limited by the reluctance of some creameries to provide the same sanitary handling for skim milk as for whole milk when the price received for skim milk was only one-fourth to one-third as great and the market was uncertain . This condition is changing , as the demand for safe skim milk has increased and become stabilized . Institutions in which the cost of food is an important factor and where an adequate supply of butter is provided may well include skim milk in the preparation.of many dishes . Homogenized Milk . Homogenized milk , according to the Public Health Service , has been treated in such a manner that , after a storage period of 48 hours , tests of the 100 cubic centimeters decanted from the top of a quart bottle will not show a difference in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat content over tests of the remainder of the milk after thorough shaking . On 4 per cent milk the difference shall not exceed 2 per cent . To conform to these requirements the milk is preheated , clarified , homogenized near pasteurization temperatures , pasteurized , and cooled . Only high-quality milk which has a good flavor and low bacterial count should be used . The advantages of homogenized milk may be listed , as follows : No mixing is required when the milk is served . The taste is richer and smoother because of smaller fat globules and uniform distribution of them . The cream can not be removed . The curd tension is lower , making the milk more digestible . Preparation of the milk for infant feeding is easy . In many state institutions and some private ones the use of homogenized milk is required by law . This provision tends to eliminate the all too common practice of removing the cream for use by the staff and certain other privileged groups and leaving the skimmed milk for those less fortunate . Reconstituted Milk . Often it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of institutions , because a product of desired quality and quantity is not available or its price is prohibitive . Under these circumstances a reconstituted milk , having all of the qualities of the fresh product , may be used . It is made in large quantities by agitating the proper amounts of skim milk powder , sweet ( unsalted ) butter , and pure water for thirty minutes at 62 ? C. ( 143 ? F. ) in a glass-lined pasteurizer fitted with a water-heated revolving spiral coil . The powder is dissolved , // the butter is melted , and the ingredients are thoroughly mixed and pasteurized . Next the mixture passes through tubular filters to a homogenizer where 2,500 to 3,000 pounds of pressure per square inch emulsifies the fat , which will not separate out later in the bottled product . The milk is then cooled to a temperature of about 4 ? C. ( 40 ? F. ) and bottled . Reconstituted milk has many advantages . It can be made often or made and stored at low temperatures ; the proportion of ingredients is controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variation ; and , if good-quality products are properly combined , the flavor is much the same as that of the best pasteurized milk . Buttermilk . There are , in general , two types of buttermilk : churned , often known as old-fashioned , and cultured . The first of these is obtained by churning sour milk or cream ; the second results from the growth of certain species of microorganisms in whole skimmed or partly skimmed milk . Churned buttermilk should be mildly acid , have fairly good body but not be thick . It should contain about 2 per cent butterfat , an appreciable amount of which should occur as butter granules . Cultured buttermilk may be either of two types : one made entirely from skim milk and the other from a mixture of milk and skim milk containing about 2 per cent butterfat . Frequently cultured buttermilk is churned before bottling to make it resemble churned buttermilk . Chocolate Milk . The standards for chocolate milk vary considerably . The composition of plain milk is regulated by law , but unfortunately in most situations the cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not controlled . In some of the recent regulations adopted , however , the butterfat content for chocolate milk is either the minimum for whole milk or is not reduced below that which would result from adding chocolate flavoring materials to whole milk . For example , the addition of 10 pounds of chocolate sirup to 100 pounds of milk containing 3.25 per cent butterfat would result in a reduction of butterfat to approximately 3 per cent . The institutional buyer should demand the same standards for this product as for plain milk . It is desirable also to limit the amount of chocolate to 1 per cent . Detailed specifications for the purchase of milk and chocolate milk as used in many institutions include the following : " Bulk milk , individual pints , shall be first quality , Grade A pasteurized milk with a minimum butterfat content of 3.8 per cent and not less than 9 per cent solids , not fat . Chocolate milk shall be made of whole fluid milk , pasteurized , with a minimum butterfat of 3 per cent . " Milk of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as possible be served in the original package . This practice is required by law // in many places . Bulk milk , whole or skimmed , to be used for cooking purposes is usually bought in 5- or 10-gallon containers . Condensed Milk . Condensed milk is whole or skim milk from which part of the water has been removed and to which sugar has been added . The final product contains about 40 per cent sugar , 30 per cent water , and 28 per cent milk solids . If purchased near the source of supply , it may be obtained in 5- or 10-gallon cans . Evaporated Milk . Evaporated milk is whole milk from which about 60 per cent of the water has been removed . After evaporation of the water the milk is sealed in cans and sterilized . The final product con tains about 26 per cent total milk solids and 8 per cent butterfat . An 8-pound can ( confectioner 's size ) is convenient for the institution using large quantities of evaporated milk . Powdered Milk . Dried skim milk and dried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags , 200-pound barrels , or metal drums . Of the two , dried skim milk is more widely used , doubtless because of its superior keeping qualities . A pertinent question that arises in plans for the use of dried milk is the effect of the drying process upon the wholesomeness and nutritive value . The quality of dried milk depends upon that of the fresh milk from which it is made , upon the method of drying , and tle care taken in the manufacturing process . Dry milk from first-class creameries is prepared from milk of exceptionally high // quality . readily dispersed in water than those made by the roller process . Fairbanks and Mitchell have shown that it is possible to dry milk without appreciably affecting either the energy or the nutritive value of the proteins , as is indicated by a biological value of 90 for the proteins of raw liquid skim milk and 89 for dried skim milk . To some extent processed milks , condensed , evaporated , and powdered , have replaced fresh milk in some institutional kitchens . Their low water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when diluted for use is practically the same as that of fresh milk except that the mineral content may be slightly reduced by the heating process . The composition of these milk products is shown in Table 30 . The proportions in which processed milks , so extensively used in insti-tutional cookery , may be substituted for fluid milk are shown in Table 31 . Cream . Raw and pasteurized cream may be purchased , the same standards prevailing for cream as for milk except that the bacterial count // permitted in milk may be doubled for cream . For this reason pasteurized cream is recommended as a safety measure . Coffee cream or light cream must contain not less than 18 per cent butterfat . Light whipping cream contains 30 to 35.9 per cent butterfat . Whipping or heavy cream usually contains at least 36 per cent butterfat . The whipping quality of cream is dependent upon : Fat content ( 30 ? 35 per cent desirable ) ; Aging at a low . temperature ( 40 ? F. or less ) for 15 ? 24 hours ; Temperature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while whipping . The importance of maintaining a low temperature can not be overstressed ; Type of whipper ; Volume or amount of cream whipped . It is. better to whip several small portions than one large quantity . If pasteurization has been properly carried out , the whipping quality of cream will be only slightly altered . Ice Cream . Among the most popular desserts in any food service would be listed ice cream and other frozen desserts . Evidence of the popularity of ice cream is the fact that current production approximates 1,600,000 ; 000 quarts annually and that the seasonal character of its demand is passing rapidly . Ice cream is not only palatable but also nourishing . The usual basic mix contains over 80 per cent cream and milk products , 15 per cent sugar , 4.5 per cent flavoring , and 0.3 ? 0.5 per cent stabilizer ( often food gelatin ) . In the majority of food services ice cream and other frozen desserts are purchased rather than made within the institution . Specifications for these food products are important . Points to consider in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mix should be pasteurized . The fat content should be not less than the legal standard . The weight per gallon should be not less than 41/2 pounds . Any coloring and flavoring added to the mix should be from natural sources . No synthetic products should be used . Important differences among various frozen desserts are indicated in Table 32 . Detailed specifications for ice cream include the use of high-grade natural flavors ; the addition of synthetic flavors is prohibited . Individual wrapped bricks must be machine cut , the size per gallon to be as designated . The finished product should contain an average of not less than 12 per cent butterfat and not less than 38 per cent total solids ; it must // weigh at least 412 pounds per gallon and have not more than 85 per cent overrun . Ice cream must be made from clean sweet cream , milk and milk products , and sugar . The entire mix is to be pasteurized at 155 ? F. for 30 minutes . It shall be produced and handled in accordance with the best sanitary practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all persons employed in the plant where the ice cream is manufac tured have passed a satisfactory health examination . Ice cream shall be packed and delivered in clean , sound , standard , sanitary , commercial containers . The finished product must be in well-frozen and otherwise prime condition when delivered . COOKERY . Milk is a component part of many dishes . The first stage in its processing is heating , which is usually done in a steamer to prevent scorching . The temperature to which it is heated depends upon the dish prepared . Whether the temperature desired be lukewarm or just below boiling , it is important that the milk be used as soon after reaching the desired temperature as possible . If a lukewarm temperature is main tained for a long period , the possibility of curdling is increased ; if high temperatures are maintained , a coating of coagulated albumin with cal cium salts forms on the bottom of the utensil . Both the flavor and the odor of milk are affected adversely by the continued application of heat . The presence of steam prevents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in white sauce , in its various applications to creamed dishes , souffles , and croquettes , or as the basis for a custard , the cookery of milk , like that of other ingredients used , requires a slow , low heat . The effect of the homogenization of milk on its cooking properties as manifested in the making of baked and soft custards was studied by Carr // and Trout . ' They found the cooking time for custards made with homogenized milk was from 15 to 20 minutes longer than for custards made with similar unhomogenized milk because the rate of heat pene tration was more rapid iii the latter . However , baked custards made with homogenized milk gave signifi cantly higher standing-index values than those made with unhomogenized milk , indicating better gel formation in the former . The amount of syneresis upon standing was significantly less for custards made with homogenized milk than for those made with , unhomogenized milk . In soft custards homogenized milk gave a more viscous consistency . In general both baked and soft custards made with homogenized milk were regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the use of dried milk in institutional cookery , fostered by the convenience and safety it assures . Dried milk is considered an economical means of supplying milk to institutions operating on limited budgets , although the literature in the field reveals little in regard to this problem . Vail and Ames 5 reported on a study of the use of dried milk in certain institutional recipes , comparing the quality of the product , the calculated nutritive value , and the cost of the milk in products prepared with fresh skim milk , dry skim milk in quan tities to approximate those of fresh skim milk , dry skim milk in double these amounts , and dry whole milk . Their results are of interest to those concerned with quantity food preparation . In every instance prod ucts which contained dried milk were well received . Frequently they were preferred to those made with fresh milk . Cocoa made with dry skim milk , doubled in amount , had the most body and was considered by the committee on palatability to be the most desirable . Fresh skim milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with dry skim milk ranked first and those made with fresh skim milk fourth , although the total scores in each series were close . Dry skim milk , doubled in amount , gave a slightly browner crust . Cheese souffle made with dry whole milk was preferred in each of the three series . Dry skim milk , doubled in amount , gave a product which was less tender but which stood up longer than the others . This was rated fourth , but all the products were satisfactory . // Butter . According to the legal definition as promulgated by the Food and Drug Administration , " Butter is the food product usually known as butter and which is made exclusively from milk or cream or both , with or without common salt , and with or without additional coloring and contains not less than 80 per cent by weight of milk fat , all toler ances having been allowed for . " The butter which scores highest on the present market is made from pasteurized sweet cream . The points considered in scoring butter are flavor , body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The United States Standards for Grades of Butter are as follows : Table Butter of less than standard grade is no longer purchased by institutions , as other fats are substituted when the price prohibits the purchase of an acceptable grade of butter . All grades of butter may be bought in 63-pound tubs . Butter to be served in individual portions may be purchased in pound prints , 30 pounds to a carton . Since butter absorbs odors readily , it should be stored in cartons or con tainers away from food having pronounced odors . Freezing does not injure it , and if it is to be left for a long period , it should be stored at a temperature not higher than 0 ? F. The temperature for a short storage period , however , may be as high as 35 ? F. Salt will be deposited on butter which is stored unwrapped in a refrigerator . Cheese . Cheese plays an important part in the American diet be-cause of its high food value , relatively low cost , and characteristic flavor . It is defined in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A product made from the curd obtained from the whole , partly skimmed or skimmed milk of cows , or from milk obtained from other animals with or without added cream , by coagulating with rennet , lactic acid or other suitable enzyme or acid and with or without further treatment of the separated curd by heat or pressure or by means of ripening ferments , special molds or seasonings . " The many variables possible within the definition of the term are evident in the wide range of cheeses with reasonably distinct identities available on the market . It is said that there are 18 distinct varieties of cheeses obtainable in normal // times and some 300 kinds . Of this number , American cheddar cheese and cottage cheese are most widely used in this country . Cheddar cheese , being relatively high in fat ( 32 per cent ) and protein ( 23.9 per cent ) , is so concentrated that it is commonly used in combination with other foods of less-pronounced flavor and less-rich nutritive value . Cottage cheese is used almost entirely in its original form , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composition of various cheeses is indicated in Table 33 . The fat and moisture content are controlled by the Pure Foods Law . According to this , cheddar cheese can contain not more than 39 per cent moisture , and 50 per cent of the total solids must be in the form of butterfat . SELECTION . The purchase list of the institutional buyer usually includes only a limited number of the numerous varieties of cheese . Always the type of cheese should he bought which will best fit the use to be made of it . The fat and moisture contents are important considerations , as cheese may be adulterated by reducing the butterfat or substituting for part of it and by retaining an excess amount of moisture . Soft cheese will contain 40 to 70 per cent moisture ; hard cheese , 30 to 40 per cent . Cheese may be ripened by molds or by bacteria , the agent employed de-termining to a large extent the characteristic odor and flavor obtained . The following classification of cheese is simple but comprehensive : Table // Table PROCESSED CHEESE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emulsi fying agent added , and the mixture pasteurized and poured into con tainers lined with tinfoil . This procedure results in a product which has no rind and therefore no waste but has good keeping qualities . In a study ? made of consumer preferences for cheese , based upon reactions to taste , the majority indicated a preference for the processed varieties . There is no advantage , however , in using the processed cheese for cook ing purposes ; hence its use in institutional food preparation is limited . Table 34 presents the styles in which American cheese is marketed and suggests the classification usually employed to indicate one 's choice in // purchasing . There are grades of cheese , just as there are of butter , and familiarity with them will serve as a guide in institutional purchasing . Table The method of manufacture , the degree of ripening , and the acidity of a given cheese affect the ease and completeness with which it can be blended with other ingredients . A " green " or uncured cheese is rubbery and resistant to blending . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proteolytic decomposition products that give the cheese its distinctive flavor , as well as by changes in form that make for ease in blending during cookery . REVIEW OF BASIC COOKERY PRINCIPLES Too commonly cheese is erroneously considered an indigestible food ; hence to prevent distaste and complaint care and thought should be given to the choice of cheese and the preparation of dishes in which it is used . In general , cheese is introduced into dishes in a finely subdivided form , grind ing or grating being the processes used in its preliminary preparation . Heating at low to moderate temperatures causes it to soften and finally melt . Prolonged exposure to moist heat or heating at high temperatures results in a curdling or stringiness of the protein . 4 . If dry heat , as in oven cooking , is being used at high temperatures , stringiness is changed to a tough " leatheriness " equally unpalatable . Cheese melts at 163 ? C. ( 324 ? F. ) and should be cooked at a temperature not higher than 177 ? C. ( 350 ? F. ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ souffle , cheese fondue , macaroni and cheese , cheese rarebit , and cheese sauces for various vegetable , meat , and egg dishes . CHAPTER VI MEAT AND FISH MEAT The food habits of a people , together with the prevailing standard of living , determine the importance of any one food , such as meat , in the institutional diet . Religious scruples against the consumption of animal flesh , like those held by millions of Hindus in India , may entirely eliminate consideration of its use . The economic level of large numbers of Orientals is so low as to restrict sharply the consumption of a food relatively costly in comparison with rice , other cereals , and vegetables . In America the vast majority of the people have no scruples against eating the flesh of animals , meat has been abundant , and the common standard of living is high enough so that its liberal inclusion in the diet is taken as a matter of course . It is estimated by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics that the yearly per capita consumption of meat in this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per capita expenditure for meat was $52.77 out of a total annual per capita outlay for food of $145.24 . The expenditure for meat is estimated as varying with different income levels from one-fourth to one-third of the annual food cost per person . Although the figures most often cited are derived from household accounts , a report of the relative importance of meat in institutional food services indicates that the expenditure for this item is usually larger than that for any other food group . Ordinarily expenditures for meat exceed 25 per cent of the total food budget , and not infrequently they reach as high as 35 to 40 per cent . The type of institution determines in part the percentage of the food budget spent for meat . For example , hotel or club dining rooms must provide a different cut and grade of meat from those offered in a school lunchroom . There is a difference , ' too , in the size of acceptable servings and in the anticipated money return per serving . In many hotels the amount spent for meat is 33 to 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunchrooms it is 10 to 15 per cent or less . Yearly variations in the market price of meat affect these percentages somewhat , but even so meat remains an important consideration in the institutional food budget . 149 // The meats for which there is the greatest market in America are pork , beef , veal , lamb , and mutton . Reports from the Bureau of Agricultural Economics , United States Department of Agriculture , indicate the rela tive per capita consumption of the various kinds of meat for 1941 for an income group receiving $1,500 to $2,000 . Structure . The meat tissue or flesh from any of the common sources . listed is composed of muscle fibers , connective tissue , and adipose or fatty tissue . The characteristic structure is produced by muscle fibers sur rounded by and attached to other fibers and to the bone by connective tissue . Fat is present either within the lean tissues as visible marbling or within a network of connective tissue . The fibers of the skeletal muscle are elongated cells , averaging 1 to 2 inches in length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ container for the liquid meat serum . The connective tissue , readily observed in almost all animal flesh , serves to bind the muscles to each other and to the bony structure , and also to bind related structures such as bones together , serving at joints to connect the opposing surfaces and to allow for necessary flexibility at these and other points of the body . Connective tissue found in various parts of the animal differs , depending upon the function to be served . The muscle sheath and the tendons that terminate the fleshy part of a muscle and attach it to the bone are made up of white connective tissue , nonelastic and high in collagen content . The connective tissues that bind such related structures as bones together , connecting the opposed surfaces of a joint , the connective tissue of blood vessels , and some of that found in the muscle tissues , where elasticity is a requisite , are comprised largely of yellow connective tissue in which elastin is present in approximately the same ratio as collagen is in the white connective tissue . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which white connec- ' tive tissue is present may be cooked in hot water or steamed to a marked ' degree of tenderness . Elastin is firm , resistant , and unchanged even by long-continued treatment with heat and moisture . Hence , meat contain ing a high percentage of yellow connective tissue , high in elastin , will not become tender , despite steaming and other cookery procedures de-signed to produce such a product . It is thus evident that the relative // tenderness of meat depends in part upon the kind and the amount of connective tissue present . Table 36 shows the differences found in the connective tissue contained in meat from different sources . Pork tenderloin , commonly regarded as a tender meat , has both a low elastin content and a low collagen content in contrast to less tender beef shank , which has an extremely high elastin content . Lamb , like pork , is low in connective tissue and may be cooked even in dry heat to a satisfactory degree of tenderness . The connective tissue in veal is relatively greater , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooking become markedly tender . The amounts of white and yellow connective tissue present are found , as would be logically expected , to vary conspicuously from cut to cut in the beef carcass . The degree of difference that may be found between two beef cuts is shown by the figures cited for the collagen and elastin content in beef rib and beef shank in Table 36 . The figures reported indicate that beef shank has approximately double the elastin content of // beef rib . The high percentage of elastin accounts for the lack of tender-ness of the shank and the necessity of moist heat cookery . Other studies show that a consistent relationship exists between the collagen content and the tenderness of the cut . Mitchell points out : Among different retail cuts of beef examined , the eye-muscle of the rib possessed for practically all calves examined the lowest content of collagen , expressed as collagen nitrogen in per cent of total nitrogen . The tenderloin was only slightly higher . The round , porterhouse and sirloin were next in order and were indis-tinguishable from each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ con-tained consistently larger percentages of collagen nitrogen than the more expensive cuts , but the fore shanks of all calves contained the highest , the collagen nitrogen of this cut averaging 23 per cent of the total nitrogen of the lean . The outer round generally contained more collagen than the inner round . . . . The distribution of elastin among the different retail cuts of meat differs from the distribution of collagen , but appears to be as consistent and as significant.3 In addition to the muscle fibers and the white and yellow connective tissue that serves to bind the muscles and connect the joints and muscles , the meat of all animals contains intracellular fat , intercellular fat , intra-muscular fat , and fat globules held in the connective tissue cells . The amount of fat present and its deposition depend upon a number of fac-tors , such as the species , breed , age , and degree of finish of the animal . Composition . The similarity , as well as evident differences , in the contribution made to the diet by these common flesh foods is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pork , beef , mutton , lamb , and veal . PROTEIN . Scrutiny of a tabular presentation of the composition of various kinds and cuts of meat would show that protein is the principal solid present in muscle tissue . This protein is present in the muscle fibers or stroma and in the plasma or fluid of meat . Myosin , globulin , and albumin are all present in muscle protein as is also the iron-containing hemoglobin which gives meat its red color . The amount of protein varies usually with change in fat content . Even in a particular cut the pro-tein ordinarily constitutes about 15 to 21 ) per cent of the edible portion , although , as the fat content increases , the percentage of protein in rela-tion to the whole cut decreases . The distribution of amino acids in the proteins of muscle tissue and the amounts of these acids make meat a food of good nutritive value . In addition to the proteins found in muscle fiber , others , less efficient , are present in the connective tissue . These proteins are collagen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , although // composed of many of the amino acids found in muscle protein , lacks tryptophane and hence is unable by itself to meet- the protein require-ment of the body . Other nitrogenous substances present in muscle tissue include the ex-tractives , creatine , and purines , both free and bound . The presence of these substances determines to a large measure the characteristic flavor of meat and meat products . The percentage of the purines present is relatively higher in the glandular tissues because of the nucleoproteins found in the cells of these tissues . // FAT . All meats contain fat deposited in adipose and connective tissue , between the fiber and muscle bundles , between and in the muscle cells . The distribution of fat influences the value of the carcass . A large pro-portion of fat deposited as marbling increases the value but heavy fat layers deposited internally reduce it . Not only does the percentage of fat vary with the nutritive state of the animal , but also the amount of fat deposition is not uniform in all parts of the body . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 per cent is found in different cuts . During the process of digestion fats break down into fatty acids and as such are used by the body . Important among these essential acids are linoleic and linolenic , of which lard is a rich source . MINERALS . The ash or mineral content of meat is approximately 1 per cent and is in direct relation to the protein present . Among the minerals important in human nutrition and present in significant amounts in meat are calcium , phosphorus , sulphur , iron , copper , and manganese . Sherman states that average meat is calculated to contain , per 100 grams of protein , other minerals about as follows : Palatability . The palatability of meat , upon which so much of its popularity as a food depends , is determined largely by tenderness , flavor , and juiciness . Consideration of these factors influencing the palatability of meat is of great importance to those persons charged with the respon sibility of institutional food service . Kinds of Meat . Meat most commonly used in institutions includes beef , pork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More detailed considerations will be given in the discussion of beef than of lamb and pork , because of the wider variations in the factors which affect the quality and palatability of beef . Among these factors are breed , age , sex , weight , and degree of finish of the animal and the location of the cut . Breed . It is generally accepted that beef cattle yield a higher percentage of edible meat and meat of a higher quality than dairy cattle , whose selection has been made wholly on the basis of milk and butterfat produc tion . No data giving a comparison of identical cuts between these two // kinds of cattle are available , but acceptance of the effect of breed on quality is general . Age . Grain-fed cattle of good quality are being marketed younger than they were several decades or even several years ago , the proportion of cattle two years old and older decreasing and the proportion of calves and yearlings increasing . The advantage of this shift to the producer lies in the more economical finishing of the younger cattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an anticipated rise in the market than is possible with mature animals . It is pointed out that " from the consumer 's viewpoint the carcass of the younger animal is more desirable because it cuts out smaller steaks and roasts which more nearly fit the purse and oven of the housewife , has little or no waste fat on the cuts even when finished , and supplies tender meat . As a matter of fact , these small , tender cuts do not have the desirable flavor of mature beef of the same quality , but since most consumers judge beef largely by its leanness and tenderness , the lack of flavor in baby beef is not objectionable except to a few connoisseurs . There are enough of these connoisseurs , however , to supply a constant , if small , demand for mature beef of quality , and a certain amount of such beef is always in demand by the high class hotels , restaurants , and clubs and by the dining car and steamship trade . " Other writers 7 confirm the statement that beef from two-year-old and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Points of advan tage cited include a desirable cherry-red color , a general distribution of fat throughout the muscle , and satisfactory ripening of meat from older animals . The age of the animal was found to have little effect on the percentage yield of various cuts as related to carcass weight . Tests made by roasting meat under carefully controlled conditions led to the conclu sion that " while the flavor of the roasts from the calves was not undesir able , yet it was rather flat , insipid and tasteless when compared to that of the roasts from the older animals . " ' To produce beef for roasts having the most desirable flavor the investigators concluded that " steers should be at least 20 months old and preferably 30. " // The findings of Mackintosh et al.10 indicate that " the beef from mature steers is apparently less tender than that from yearling cattle . The shear and collagen nitrogen factor are much higher in the case of older cattle ; however , the palatability factor is only slightly lower . " Sex . There has been for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets , a prejudice based on the belief that for some reason such beef is less desirable than that obtained from steers . This prejudice is so widespread that to provide a market for heifer beef its price , at least in the United States , is often from one to three cents lower per pound than that of steer beef of equal grade . The statement is made that " ninety-nine beef consumers out of every hundred can not distinguish between heifer and steer beef in the carcass , in the cut , or on the table , // yet most of them honestly believe that heifer beef is vastly inferior to steer beef and refuse to buy it except at a cut price . When one considers that heifers supply most of the beef in many of the better-grade markets it is apparent that many people who would not purchase heifer beef as such are doing so regularly . " 12 Results of studies carried on at the Agricultural Experiment Station , University of Illinois , show that the percentage of round , rump , loin , ribs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmness of fat , color of lean , and palatability of the cooked beef there were no differences attributable to sex . Investigations at Michigan Agricultural Experiment Station on yearling cattle confirm these earlier studies with regard to . cutting yield . Findings of these investigators are given in Table 38 . Differences in the composition of meat from the various sections of beef are shown in Table 39. // Ripening . The ripening or aging of meat is accomplished by hanging the fresh chilled carcass or cuts at a temperature of 2 ? C. ( 36 ? F. ) and a low relative humidity for a period varying from 10 to 60 days . It has been found that at this temperature the range of ripening time yielding a product preferred by American people is from 25 to 30 days . Ripening causes meat to become more juicy , more tender , and more highly flavored . Investigations 14 on 55 paired beef roasts , one member of each pair roasted after hanging 120 hours and its mate roasted after ripening an additional 28 days , showed that the tenderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some extent . It is a generally accepted fact that continuance of the ripening process beyond this point results in a high , gamy flavor more esteemed in England than in this country . A certain amount of finish is essential in ripening ; that is , a carcass must have a fair covering of fat in order to ripen at all . This requirement is accepted as indicating that the outside layer of fat and the fat within the muscle fibers inhibit the growth of putrefactive organ-isms yet allow the enzymes responsible for ripening to continue the de-sired process . Recent studies have shown that the time of ripening can be decreased from weeks to about 3 days by using ultraviolet rays and increasing the temperature of the storage room to 60 ? F. The degree of shrinkage when humidity is kept at 8() to 95 per cent is low . The use of ultraviolet rays on the surface of meats prevents the growth of micro-organisms which under the old method of ripening resulted in molds on the moist surface and although not toxic changed the flavor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used on beef and mutton of the higher grades at the present time . Aging or ripening pork does not improve its quality or make it more tender . Selection . According to government regulations all meat shipped from one state to another must be inspected and stamped to show that the carcass is free from disease and lit for human consumption . This does not mean that all meat available on a market has been subject to such inspection . Locally killed meat may or may not be inspected , de-pending upon city and state ordinances and laws . Certainly no meat should be purchased for an institutional food service that has not passed government inspection . Health hazards are too great to permit any other practice than purchasing meat with the label " U. S. inspected and passed . " The quality of meat , for the convenience of buyer and seller , has been classified and graded into groups having similar characteristics . The grade is determined by ( 1 ) the conformation , that is , the general form , // shape , and contour of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , the thick-ness , character and distribution of fat ; and ( 3 ) the quality of the flesh and fat . The marbling of the lean with fat is regarded as an important index of grade . According to Mackintosh and Hall 15 " the degree of finish or fatness of beef appears to be associated with palatability . ' An increased degree of finish renders more intense the properties of tenderness , juici-ness , and flavor . . . . Without a doubt there is a point beyond which in-creased increments of fat will not improve the palatability further . " Some of the measurements relating to degree of finish in this study have been correlated with the palatability factors and are summarized in Table 40 . Color , firmness of flesh , and fineness of grain are also indices in grad-ing . The importance of color may be summarized as follows : " There are two different types of color gradation . ( 1 ) The gradation from white , through pink , to a brilliant red , exemplified by veal , calf , and mature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscle pigmen-tation or muscle hemoglobin ; ( 2 ) the gradation from a brilliant red through dark red to black , probably caused by a decreasing permeability to oxygen resulting in inability of the hemoglobin to obtain oxygen . The difference here is comparable to the color difference in venous blood and arterial blood . " 16 Where the other factors indicative of good quality // are present , meat of dark color need not be discriminated against . Cuts or carcasses often spoken of as dark cutter or black cutter have a satisfactory color after cooking and a palatability comparable to brightcolored meat of like grade . CLASSES AND GRADES . Standards indicating quality have been set by the United States government for the grading of all meat and some meat products . The specifications for each grade of meat are so clearly defined that it is now possible to purchase satisfactorily large quantities of meat entirely by grade . Buying by grade is the only method which will insure the average buyer the quality of meat he desires . The first step in grad ing meat is the division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into classes ? for example , steer , heifer , cow , bull , and stag . These classes are based on the sex and age condition of the animal and are further divided into the more specific groups or grades designating quality . The present official standards for grades of carcass beef , established by the Agricultural Marketing Service , formerly the Bureau of Agricultural Economics , became effective July 16 , 1939 . These grades are : U. S. // Prime , U. S. Choice , U. S. Good , U. S. Commercial , U. S. Utility , U. S. Cutter , and U. S. Canner . Beef falling into each class will possess the characteristics specified for that grade , irrespective of the sex of the animal from which it came . Beef produced from cows will not , however , grade U. S. Prime or U. S. Choice ; only young , well-finished beef-type cows may grade U. S. Good ; beef from steers , heifers , and cows may qualify for the remaining grades ? U. S. Commercial , U. S. Utility , U. S. Cutter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large percentage of U. S. Cutter grade . A very large percentage of U. S. Canner grade beef is produced from cows somewhat advanced in age . The system of grading livestock and meats , of which the standards for the grades above are a part , is based on the three factors discussed previously : conformation , finish , and quality . These grade factors have been explained . Official Standards for U. S. Grades . Although the descriptions of the grades are primarily in terms of carcass beef , they are applicable also to wholesale beef cuts ; it must be recognized , however , that all the wholesale cuts from a carcass may not grade the same as the carcass from which they were made . The standards for grades are intended to describe the characteristics of carcass beef and wholesale cuts that are representative of the middle point of that grade . U. S. Prime grade . Beef from only beef-type steers and heifers of an exceptionally high degree of perfection in breeding and feeding will qualify for this grade . Beef carcasses and wholesale cuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Table // Table // Table " Beef wholesale cuts , " according to Revised Maximum Price Regulation No. 169 , released by OPM December 10 , 1942 , includes cuts meeting the following minimum specifications , derived from the beef carcass , but excluding the offal and any item not included herein : ( 1 ) Hindquarter means the posterior portion of the side remaining after the severance of the 12-rib forequarter from the side , and comprising the round , full loin including the 13th rib , flank , kidney , and hanging tender all in one piece , which posterior portion shall be obtained by cutting the beef side between the 12th and 13th ribs keeping the knife firmly against the 12th rib while cutting down the length of the rib . ( 2 ) Forequarter means the anterior portion of the side remaining after the severance of the 1-rib hindquarter from the side , and comprising the rib , regular chuck , brisket , short plate , and foreshank all in one piece , which anterior portion contains the 1st to the 12th rib , inclusive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining after the severance of the untrimmed full loin and flank from the hindquarter.

OTHER KINDS OF MEAT . Important kinds of meat other than beef are veal , calf , pork , lamb , and mutton . Veal . Veal is defined as the flesh of bovine animals , usually not over twelve weeks of age at the time of killing , the largest number being slaughtered between the ages of three and six weeks . Calf carcasses , ac-cording to these authors , are from more mature animals of the bovine species that have passed beyond the veal stage but have not yet taken on beef characteristics . Veal carcasses usually weigh between 50 and 150 pounds ; calf carcasses , from 100 to 350 pounds . The musculature of veal carcass resembles that of beef carcass , the im maturity being expressed not in muscle pattern but in character of flesh . The ruddy color of beef is lacking , the flesh being a light pinkish gray-brown . The flesh is fine grained , soft or flabby in texture , containing little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and characteris- // tically colored . Calf carcasses have some of the characteristics of veal but as many or more of the characteristics of beef . The flesh and fat are firmer than those of veal and the flesh is a deeper red . There is little difference in the division of veal and calf carcasses into cuts , the principal wholesale cuts in both cases being hind saddle and fore saddle . These are subdivided into leg , loin , rib , shoulder , breast , and shank . The grades of veal most commonly used in institutions are prime , choice , good , and medium , sometimes designated as No . Al , No. 1 , No. 2 , and No. 3 . The meat of good veal is light pink in color , fine in grain , and firm and velvety in texture . The small quantity of fat is clear , firm , and pinkish ' white . There is no marbling of fat in the meat . The bones are porous , soft , and red . Pork . Pork is the flesh of swine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form of wholesale cuts . Approximately 25 per cent of the dressed carcass is sold as fresh pork , 15 per cent is rendered into lard , and 60 per cent is cured by various methods or manufactured into meat products . Pork cuts generally sold fresh are loins , skinned shoulders , Boston butts , and spareribs . Hams , sides , picnic shoulders , and boneless butts are generally cured and smoked , although certain sections of the country use ' fairly large quantities of these cuts as fresh pork . These percentage figures are based on total pork distribution in the United States over a five-year average . The grades of pork are known as No. 1 , No. 2 , and No. 3 . The best quality has meat which is grayish white to pink in young animals and deep rose in the older ones . The flesh is firm and fine grained , the lean is well marbled with firm fat . The bones are soft and red . The flesh of the poorer grades is coarse and dark red in color , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lamb is a term commonly used to designate the flesh of young animals of the ovine species , usually limited to those under 12 or 14 months of age yielding a carcass weighing between 35 and 45 pounds . Yearling mutton carcasses arc from sheep 1 to 2 years old . These carcasses are larger and usually fatter than lamb carcass . The large , wide abdominal cavity and the greater length of body and legs are other identifying features . The flesh is coarser and firmer than lamb , and its color is pink to light red in contrast to the light to dark pink of lamb . Mature mutton is from sheep more than 20 months of age . The bones are hard , the break joint is not present , and a characteristic bow is shown in the carcass . The flesh is light to dark red . // Differences between lamb and mutton carcasses have been summarized as follows : Lamb carcasses as a group are distinguished from mutton carcasses by their smaller softer bones , lighter-colored flesh , softer and whiter external and internal fats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the break joint of the forelegs . . . . Lamb foreleg joints break in four well-defined ridges , resembling somewhat the teeth of a saw . These ridges are smooth , moist , and red with blood.17 In mature carcasses the bones are hard and firm , and little if any indi cation of blood is seen at the joint . The principal wholesale cuts in both lamb and veal are , leg , loin , rack , breast , and shoulder . The grades in which an institutional buyer would be interested are choice , good , and medium . The flesh of lamb is pinkish red in color and firm and fine grained in texture . The lean meat is marbled with clear white fat . The best way of identifying lamb is by means of the break joint . In lamb this joint is porous , moist , and reddish ; in older animals it is hard and white . The flesh of mutton is firm , coarse , dry , and redder in color than that of lamb . The fat of mutton is more brittle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important for their nutritive value are cer tain of the organs from the carcasses of cattle , hogs , and sheep . Brains , sweetbreads , liver , kidneys , heart , and tongue are among the more com mon . The regard in which these are held varies from the esteem ac-corded sweetbreads to the acceptance as commonplace of hog liver with its side serving of onions and heart with its stuffing of bread crumbs and sage . Sweetbreads may be found on the table of the exclusive club ; liver and heart appear frequently on the menus of food services offering nutri tious food at relatively low costs . The food values that make the inclusion of these organs in the diet desirable have been summarized by Child 18 as follows : Liver contains an abundance of iron in the right form for assimilation . Pork liver contains three times as much iron as beef liver , and beef liver has more iron than that of veal or lamb . Liver has , also , a rich supply of vitamin A , thiamine , and riboflavin . All these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron content , kidney ranks next to liver . Kidney is a good source of vitamin A , thiamine , and riboflavin . Sweetbreads arc a good source of vitamins A and B. Heart and tongue are muscular organs and their food value is much the same as that of lean beef . Table 41 shows the average weights per head of variety meats . // Ground fresh meats , sucn as beef for loaves , lamb for patties , pork for sausage , and cubed meat for stews , are commonplace in most institu-tional menus . The problems involved in their preparation differ from those of meat not so finely subdivided . Their ready inclusion in other dishes , the low waste , the assurance of a relative tenderness , and the pos-sibility of giving the product a definite form have all contributed to their wide use . They are frequently included in food services offering low-cost diets . FROZEN MEAT . Frozen meat is becoming increasingly popular in in-stitutional food services . Meat to be frozen is boned , compressed into the smallest possible space , and quick frozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freezing of flesh food involves direct immersion in or direct contact with a liquid refrigerant , such as sodium chloride brine , at a temperature of - 43 ? to - 46 ? C. ( ? 45 ? to - 50 ? F. ) . Flesh foods so frozen retain almost completely the appearance , flavor , and general characteristics of the fresh product . Advantages of the use of frozen meats in institutions include assurance of good quality , since meat cuts are frozen at the time of year when they are at their best ; dependability of the supply of foods throughout the year ; and often a money saving , as all waste has been removed and only edible meat is purchased . Frozen meat products now available for distribution and most commonly used in institutional food services include : // Pork . Loin , loin chops , skinned shoulder , spareribs , neck bones , hocks , knuckles , tenderloin , and hams . Lamb . Cuts frozen only at certain times of the year . Loins , legs , shoulders , shanks , breasts , and racks . Veal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boneless cuts ? eye of rib , sirloin butt , sirloin strip , tenderloin , clod , and leg . Sundries . Beef and calf sweetbreads ; beef , lamb , and pork livers ; pork cutlets ; pork feet ; pork and ox tails ; beef , lamb , and pork hearts and brains ; pork kidneys . CURED MEATS . In the preceding discussion attention was focused in the main on fresh meats , as it is in this form that most of the flesh eaten by man is consumed . However , much use is made also of cured meats , such as ham , bacon , corned beef , dried beef , and salt pork , in all types of institutional menus . They are served alone or are often combined with other foods in what has been termed luncheon dishes . DEHYDRATED MEATS . Dehydrated meat requires only about one-tenth the shipping space that would be required if it were in carcass form . For this reason much attention has been given to dehydrated meat , which in turn has led to marked increase in production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be dehydrated and that all bones , tendons , blood vessels , and fat in excess of 10 per cent must be removed . Processing consists of cutting the meat into cubes and precooking to render enzymes inactive , coagulate the heatlabile proteins , and reduce the water content to about one-half . Then drying is carried on under carefully controlled conditions for approximately two hours . The dehydrated meat , when completed , contains 55 per cent protein , 30 per cent fat , 10 per cent moisture , and added salts not in excess of 3.5 per cent . It is packed under 200 pounds of pressure in airtight containers which are vacuum sealed . Pork requires a precooking period about three to four times as long as beef . When dehydration is completed , the product contains 50 per cent protein , 40 per cent fat , and 10 per cent moisture . The process of dehydration is so new that as yet little is known concerning its effects on the nutritive value of meat . To use , dehydrated meat must first be re-hydrated and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products . Care of Meat . Meat for institutional food services , other than that sold by the carcass or wholesale cuts , is usually delivered in barrels or boxes packed with dry ice . The first step after unpacking is the checking of the weight delivered with that called for by the invoice . If the meat is not to be used at once , it is unwrapped and stored in the meat refrigerator on large trays or hung on meat hooks designated for this purpose . For unfrozen meat the temperature should be from 1 ? to 2 ? C. // ( 33 ? to 36 ? F. ) and the relative humidity from 80 to 90 per cent . The temperature range must be carefully regulated so that the minimum does not fall below 0 ? C. ( 32 ? F. ) . Temperatures below this level cause the surface of beef , veal , and lamb to darken because of slow freezing action . If any section of the refrigerator is colder than the average temperature of 1 ? to 2 ? C. ( 33 ? to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh pork cuts . Smoked meats , because they are now so mildly cured , must be refrig erated just like fresh meat . They should not be kept longer than two weeks . Ground meat should be used within twenty-four hours or frozen . Variety meats , such as hearts , brains , sweetbreads , and liver , should be used within twenty-four hours or precooked or frozen . ' Frozen meats will keep indefinitely so long as they remain frozen . Once thawed , they should not be refrozen and should be used at once . Cooked meat should be kept well covered . Cookery of Meat . The objectives in the cookery of meat are to de stroy bacteria or other microorganisms and any parasites that may be present , to coagulate the proteins , to make the meat tender by hydrolysis and softening of the white connective tissue , and to develop the desired flavor and color , thus enhancing palatability . FACTORS AFFECTING HEAT PENETRATION . Cookery of meat is accom-plished when the heat necessary to achieve the desired changes has pene trated to the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four factors which affect the time required to cook meat or the rate of heat penetration include : ( 1 ) the cooking temperature ; ( 2 ) the relation of weight to surface area , i.e. , the shortest distance to the center of the thickest portion ; ( 3 ) the composition ; and ( 4 ) the degree of doneness . Obviously the higher the cooking temperature the more rapid the con duction of heat . The effect of higher temperatures on palatability and on the amount of shrinkage , however , is such as to make their use un desirable . Lowe 19 also points out , " It is obvious ... that the shorter the distance to the center of a piece of meat the more rapidly will the heat penetrate ; the longer the distance , the more time will be required . Weight and surface area are not satisfactory to determine cooking time , for the size of the piece and its shape determine the distance to the thickest part of the meat . A thin wide roast will cook in less time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Among the important factors in the composition of meat bearing on heat penetration are the amount and location of fat and the presence or // absence of bone . Studies conducted at the University of California 20 show that " fat plays a role in the speed of heat penetration into the meat , the direction of its influence depending upon the location of the fat . Exterior fat speeds up the rate of heat penetration but interior fat may retard it . This is due to the change in the heat conductivity of fat as it passes from the solid to the liquid condition . " Bone was shown by these investigations to be a poor conductor of heat . However , in seeming con-tradiction , other investigators 21 report that boneless roasts require more time per pound than those with bone . Although too little research has been done for us to draw definite conclusions about the extent of the influence of these factors , we know that other considerations , such as the type of fuel , the stove and utensils used , and the shape and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heat penetration . Studies concerning the continuance of heat penetration to the center of the cut after its removal from the source of heat indicate that the internal temperature rises if the meat is uncut for a period of 15 to 45 minutes . The degree of this continued heat penetration is regarded as depending upon the internal temperature of the meat when removed from the heat and on the temperature at which it was cooked . These also determine the degree of doneness , a factor important in most people 's enjoyment of meat . A more uniform degree of doneness for beef and veal is obtained by low temperatures , 149 ? C. ( 300 ? F. ) , than by higher temperatures , 177 ? to 191 ? C. ( 350 ? to 375 ? F. ) , although the optimum oven temperature for fresh pork is 177 ? C. ( 350 ? F. ) . Rare roast beef cooked at low tempera-ture will be pink throughout the slice , whereas a roast cooked to the same internal temperature at high oven temperature will be grayish with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer cooking time is required at a lower temperature . The longer cooking period may be a disadvantage in some institutions where both oven space and time are limited . However , the advantages of low-temperature roasting so far outweigh the one objection of increased time that it seems worth while for the institutional manager to find some means of overcoming this handicap . Although a longer cooking period is required for the roast cooked at the lower temperature , studies indicate that fuel consumption is less . This is evident in Table 42. // Few studies have been made on methods of determining when a roast ' large enough for institutional food services is done . Recent investigations in this field , presented in Table 43 , are therefore welcome . Ratios of heat penetration , usually expressed as a time-weight relationship , that is , in minutes per pound , can not be carried over directly from an experi ment on a 3-pound roast to a 15-pound one . The kind and quantity of bone present , the amount and distribution of fat , and the character of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arises in the fact that heat penetration is not in direct ratio to time , tem perature , and pounds to be roasted . // The only accurate means of determining the doneness of a roast is by the use of a meat thermometer , which registers the internal temperature . The thermometer is so placed in the roast that its bulb is in the center of the thickest part . Shrinkage . Assured of a safe and palatable product by the proce-dure used , the institutional food director must turn her attention to the losses occurring during the cooking process . Herein may lie the factor determining whether the meat costs per serving may be kept within those limits compatible with the money return for the food or the per diem allowance of the particular food service . Investigations on losses in cooking meat have led to the conclusion that shrinkage results from the interplay of four chief factors : the char-acter of the meat , the method of cooking used , the temperature at which it is cooked , and the degree of doneness to which it is brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , the composi-tion of meat from different sources varies . For this reason it is to be expected that there will be variations in the shrinkage losses in similar cuts of different meats , such as beef , pork , lamb , and veal . An investi-gation that affords a direct comparison under carefully controlled condi-tions is the British study of McCance and Shipp. ' 4 Since steaming was used as the cookery process , losses through evaporation were avoided . These investigators report the following percentage losses in weight of various flesh and other foods from steaming for different lengths of time . The grade of meat also is held to influence the cookery process chosen , the time required , and the degree of shrinkage . Roasts or similar cuts from carcasses of different grades , such as rib roasts from choice and common grades , differ greatly in their composition and in their fat marbling . This difference is reflected in the time required for cook-ing , in the shrinkage occurring at a definite stage of doneness , and in the character of the final product . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in speaking of the quality or grade of meat as important , states that " fat undoubtedly has an effect on the changes which occur during cooking ; in the case of the external fat , this may be by affecting either the penetration of heat or the loss of moisture ; in the case of fat surrounding the muscle fibers it may be by modifying the // processes of coagulation and water loss . " Alexander and Clark 2 " point out that in their work on cooking legs of lamb it appears that the com position of the meat , that is , the index of the grade , determines the char acter and relative amount of shrinkage . Fat-covered carcasses that would grade high lost less through evaporation than did cuts lacking fatty pro tection . Ripening meat also affects its shrinkage . In the study just referred to , Alexander and Clark report " increasing the length of the ripening period after slaughter decreased the cooking shrinkage and shortened the time required to roast a leg of lamb . As the ripening period of lamb increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller and the rate of heat penetration more rapid . " 27 EFFECT OF COOKERY ON SHRINKAGE . Detailed experiments by Grindley and Mojonnier 28 afford valuable information concerning the nature and extent of the losses which meats undergo during cooking , the changes in nutritive value of cooked meats , the kind of changes which take place in meats cooked by the several common methods , such as boiling , pan-broiling , sauteing , and roasting , and the influence of cookery upon the flavor and palatability of meats . Their conclusions regarding the chemical losses and various other changes which take place during the cooking of meats were : ( 1 ) the chief loss in weight during boiling , sauteing , and panbroiling was due to the removal of water by the heat of cooking . In roasting , the losses were largely the result of the removal of both water and fat ; ( 2 ) the losses of nutritive material in panbroiling were very small as compared with those which take place in boiling , sauteing , and roasting ; ( 3 ) when beef was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent of the nitrogenous matter , 0.60 to 37.40 per cent of the fat , and 20.04 to 67.39 per cent of the mineral matter of the original uncooked meat were found in the broth ; ( 4 ) when meats were roasted , 0.25 to 4.55 per cent of the nitrogenous matter , 4.53 to 57.49 per cent of the fat , and 2.47 to 27.18 per cent of the mineral matter present in the uncooked meat were found in the drippings ; ( 5 ) in boiling of meats the higher the percentage of fat in the cut , other things being the same , the less water and nitrogenous // and mineral matter were lost , but the more fat was lost ; ( 6 ) in boiling , panbroiling , and roasting , the losses increased in proportion to the degree of cooking ; in other words the longer the time of cooking , the greater the loss , other conditions being the same ; ( 7 ) as a rule the larger the piece of meat boiled or roasted , the smaller the relative losses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat , covering many pf the points investigated by Grindley and Mojonnier and enlarging in sev eral'regards on the scope of the earlier study , was undertaken in England . In these investigations McCance and Shipp 39 found , that the application of heat above 60 ? C. ( 140 ? F. ) to beef , fish , and other flesh foods leads to a shrinkage of their proteins and to the expression of juices with an attendant loss of salts . This is cited as the only cause of salt loss when meat is heated in steam or air , but a further salt loss due to diffusion is found to follow the heating of meat in water . The rate of shrinkage was changed only slightly by raising the cooking temperature from 80 ? to 100 ? C. ( 176 ? to 212 ? F. ) but with an increase from 100 ? to 120 ? C. ( 212 ? to 248 ? F. ) a greater shrinkage was noted . At these temperatures it was found that losses approximating 50 per cent of the water and salts may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooked , beef has been found to lose the same amount of weight , water and salts , whether the cooking was commenced in hot or cold water . " 30 These investigators confirm previous findings that in roasting meat the loss of water is due almost wholly to evaporation . The loss of salts was found to be relatively small in roasting because the evaporation of juices leaves the salts deposited on the surface . Fat was lost because it was liquefied by heat and therefore drained away from the muscle tissues . McCance and Shipp state , " It is not at all clear what is the source of the protein lost during cooking . It might have been supposed that no protein would be lost in cooking except by mechanical action on the exterior of the meat , but this is certainly not the case . Some protein material , possibly in the form of proteoses , is expressed during shrink , for the loss of protein is considerable during cooking by steam when mechanical action is reduced to a minimum .
