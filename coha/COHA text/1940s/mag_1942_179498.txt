Japan 's plan to establish diplomatic relations with the Vatican drew a second and sharper protest from the U.S. State Department to the Holy See last week . Similar representations have been made independently by Great Britain . Both powers urged that the Vatican 's assent to such an Embassy at this time might be construed as an acceptance of Japan 's recent actions . <P> Japan has never been represented at the Vatican . But its recent conquests have swelled the number of Catholics in its territory from a few hundred thousand to some 20,000,000 ( largest group : the 13,000,000 Catholics of the Philippines ) , give Japan a good surface reason to ask for an exchange of envoys . And the Vatican , which has long had an Apostolic Delegate in Japan , will have a hard time finding a good excuse for declining . <P> American Catholics seemingly back up the State Department stand . Monsignor Michael J. Ready , general secretary of the National Catholic Welfare Conference , the ringing voice of the U.S. hierarchy , declared last week that " the liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same " rampant totalitarian military forces which harass the Church and all that the Church has built . " This description obviously applied to Japan . Significantly , Monsignor Ready made his remarks at a service attended by the Apostolic Delegate to the U.S. , Archbishop Amleto Giovanni Cicoganani , who will undoubtedly pass them on to the Vatican as a good indication of how American Catholicism feels . <P> Since the return of Myron C. Taylor , President Roosevelt 's personal envoy to the Pope , the U.S. has been informally represented at the Vatican by his assistant , Career Diplomat Harold H. Tittmann Jr . After Italy entered the war , Tittmann had to move to an apartment in Vatican City , to keep from being interned .
