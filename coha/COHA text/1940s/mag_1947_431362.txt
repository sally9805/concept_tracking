WHEN Clarence Birdseye was a fur trader in Labrador he tossed a frozen fish back into the water . Astounded , he watched as it revived and swam away . This gave him the idea of quick-freezing food to preserve it ? an idea that has grown into an industry that expects to change the home life of 3,000,000 families every year . Already , 800,000,000 lb. of frozen food are being sold annually ? enough to supply the people of the State of Washington with fruits , vegetables and meats for an entire year . And this is only the beginning . Because food can be frozen in a third the time and with half the effort required for canning , more and more food will be preserved by freezing from now on . Freezers will soon be as commonplace as refrigerators . A home freezer , in fact , is just an overgrown electric refrigerator . Both have a compressor driven by an electric motor , and an evaporator with coils . In automatic refrigeration , the refrigerant , generally Freon 12 , is compressed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The gas expands in the coils , absorbs the heat inside the box , and lowers the evaporator 's temperature to 20 ? F. Food stored in a refrigerator keeps fresh for about a week at 40 ? F. , the temperature normally maintained in the food compartment . Some refrigerator manufacturers are producing freezers and using the same compressor for both . As a freezer 's insulation is much thicker , the frigid air gets less of a chance to escape , and the freezer " coasts " longer than a refrigerator . The cost of operating a freezer is about equal to that of a refrigerator . A farmer with an 18-cubic-foot freezer ? about three times larger than the average household refrigerator ? reported that his electric bill had not increased more than $2 a month . There is talk of cutting electric bills when Freon 22 , a brother of Freon 12 , appears . Freon 22 , with a boiling point of - 41 ? F. , 20 degrees below that of Freon 12 , will save money by freezing food faster . Anyone buying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a different  | picture from 1937 when freezers were homemade or custom-built . The model of freezer purchased should be based on where the buyer lives , the size of the kitchen , and the amount of food to be preserved . Three general types of freezers are available now . The manufacturers admit that none of the existing designs is wholly satisfactory , but add that keen competition is bound to bring improvements ? soon . One model is the old standby , the refrigerator , brought up to date by the addition of a low-temperature frozen-food storage compartment . Another is the chest type , with a lid on top . The third is the upright type with a front-opening door . The last two usually have space for quick freezing and a compartment for frozen food storage . For a city apartment dweller with a pintsize kitchen , the dual-temperature refrigerator with storage space for a week 's supply of frozen food should suffice . A suburbanite with a kitchen garden , however , will want a freezer big enough to put up a winter 's stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 300 pounds should be ample . On a farm , a year-around food supply probably will come out of the freezer , and the supply  | of energy available should set the size of the box . In buying a freezer it should be kept in mind that if it 's more than 29 inches wide it probably wo n't go through a house door . The freezer with a lid on top costs less because it is more economical to build than the model with a front door . The lid type does n't frost as much , either , and frost is the bugaboo of freezer operation . Frost is - caused by what refrigeration engineers call " cold-air spill . " In a freezer , cold air falls to the bottom , and the temperature is highest at the top . When you open the lid on a chest freezer , less cold air rushes out than when the whole door opens on an upright freezer . But since a freezer is opened on an average of only twice a day , as compared with the 40 times a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spilling out and hot air pouring in does not amount to five cents a month . Also , a refrigerator has to be defrosted every other week , and a freezer but once or twice a year . One drawback of the chest freezer is that it may be hard to find food in it . In the vertical freezer , the frozen food is as readily accessible on the shelves as it is in your refrigerator . One of the points to check when shopping  | for a freezer is the thickness of the insulation in the walls . Freezers are usually insulated with glass wool or cork , and more recently with cellular rubber , which is twothirds lighter than cork . The freezer with five inches of insulation is the best buy . If there is less than four inches of insulation , cold air inside the box escapes and hot air is absorbed . Two freezers , identical in every respect except insulation thickness , were tested in a research laboratory . The cabinet with five inches of insulation cost $1.78 to operate , while the freezer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to $2.54 , One of the greatest hazards in home freezing is overloading the box with food to be frozen , creating a rise in . the freezer temperature . The food may spoil before it is brought down to 32 ? F. A few degrees above zero in the storage compartment can cause fruits to discolor , vegetables and fruits to lose vitamin C , and meat fats to turn rancid , The best insurance against temperature variations is to make certain that your freezer has a thermostatic control , so that the temperature in the freezing compartment Can be brought down to - 20 ? F. for sharp freez- , ing , while the zero storage temperature is controlled in the rest of the box . What happens if a storm cuts off the power that operates a freezer ? If your unit is well constructed , there is little need to worry . No thawing will occur for about two days . if you do n't open the freezer and if it is well packed with frozen food . For longer periods , fill the freezer with dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is attributed to Boyden Sparks , author and home-freezer authority . For protection against a sudden blaze , he kept a couple of carbon dioxide fire extinguishers in his house . During a hurricane which disrupted the power , he opened the cabinet , turned on one of the extinguishers , squirted the box full of CO2 snow , and saved the day . As a precautionary measure , your freezer should have an alarm system ? preferably operated by batteries ? set to ring before a dangerously high temperature is reached . Although there 's a freezer unit in the White House , you need n't be President to enjoy the benefits of a subzero grocery store in your own home . Prices now range from $150 for a two-cubic-foot model to about $600 for a 15-cubic-foot combination freezer and storage locker . As production increases , the cost is expected to decrease . Practically all meats and fruits can be frozen successfully . Almost any vegetable survives the zero temperature , except lettuce and tomatoes which become limp when thawed . Cooked foods can be frozen , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a week in one day , and store them away , ready to heat and serve  |p92.
