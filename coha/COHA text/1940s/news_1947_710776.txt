txt A lowly worm turned in Flatbush yesterday and in the process kicked up such a terrific uproar that it is unlikely the 33,098 who witnessed the spectacle ever will forget it . Certain it is , no world series encounter in recent years has produced more slambang thrills than that which Burt Shotton 's Dodgers provided as they took the 1947 classic to Ebbets Field after suffering two humiliating defeats at the Yankee Stadium . They exploded six runs in the second inning . They slammed three more in the two succeeding rounds . Then they hung on with that tenacity born of despair to repel one Yankee onslaught after another and won by a score of 9 to 8 . Joe DiMaggio crashed a home run into the stands . Yogi Berra drove another for the relentlessly pursuing Bronx Bombers , the first ever smacked in world series history by a pinch-hitter . In the end the bulky form of Hughie Casey rose as an impenetrable barrier for Bucky Harris ' American League champions . Entering the fray with a one-run margin over the Yanks ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " struggle of the bullpen , " the florid right-hander who operates a tavern within a mile of the ball park clung grimly to his advantage and led the Flock home in front . He pitched only two and twothird innings , but because he did infinitely.better than either of his predecessors , Joe Batten and Ralph Branca , both of whom were blasted out despite impressive leads , Casey received credit for the victory . It was a fitting reward to one who had suffered much since that ghastly dropped third strike which brought misery into his life in another world series against the Yankees just six years ago . Thus , with the series entering the fourth game at Ebbets Field // this afternoon , Brooklyn 's Beloved Bums are looking up once more far from hopelessly . Though they still trail in the current classic , two games to one , they served ample notice that perhaps they had just begun to fight . Even the loss of their star , Pete Reiser , failed to dim the ardor with which they sailed into this battle . Pistol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Stadium on Wednesday , met even more disaster . He went out in the second inning with a swollen ankle that he had suffered in the first frame . Carl Furillo batted for Reiser in the second and whacked a double that drove in the last two tallies of the biggest scoring inning any Dodger team has enjoyed in world series - competition . In all the Brooks battered five pitchers for thirteen ringing blows , the same number the Yanks struck in their futile pursuit . Robinson Steals , But Is Out Loquacious Bobo Newsom was the chief victim of that bruising six-run attack and it silenced him with an air of finaliiy that brooked no further discussion . In fact he was a rather subdued Bobo right from the beginning . Absent was his usual gusto as he opened the struggle against the left-handed Hatten . Perhaps the portly righthander of 39 , who has been around a long time and traveled a lot , had a premonition . Indeed , what happened in the second inning might have occurred in the first had not the Dodgers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight , pressed their speed a trifle too far . Jackie Robinson , in that opening round , singled and stole second , only to be nipped off the bag when the Yankee infield made a quick recovery of a poor throw by Catcher Sherman Lollar . A moment later Reiser walked and tried to steal . Not only was he tagged out , but he damaged his right ankle as he collided with little Phil Rizzuto , Yankee shortstop . There was no turning back the aroused Bums once they broke loose in the second , though . The round started inconspicuously enough , with the highly respected Dixie Walker grounding out , but the great Bobo , master showman in such situations , still did n't seem sure of himself . He walked Gene Hermanski and when Bruce Edwards larruped a double into left , Gene raced in with the first tally . Then the crowd , though less than half the size of either of the two great Stadium gatherings , appeared on the spot to make twice as much noise as ever had been heard in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsided when Peewee Reese drove a single into center and Edwards counted . That produced more of a din and for the next fifteen minutes there was scarcely a moment 's lull . Spider Jorgensen flied out , but Hatten jolted the Yanks no little by plunking a single into left . A passed ball by Lollar , catching in place of Berra in the Yankee battlefront , followed and the Brooks had runners on second and third . An instant later , both were over the plate as Ed Stanky dropped a two-bagger in right . That was all for the crestfallen Newsom . Back in 1940 as a Tiger , Bobo had pitched three mighty series battles , but he did n't have it on this occaA sion . With four runs in and a runner on second , Vic Raschi , tall rookie right-hander , took over . He did n't stop the charge at once , either , for Robinson singled to right , Stanky pulling up at third . Furillo 's immediate contribution was a lofty fly that bounced off the scoreboard for a double and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the round . All bedlam broke loose at that point . Drews Permits a Run In the third , against tall Karl Drews , the Dodgers picked up another run when Hermanski was hit by a pitched ball , moved to second on a wild pitch and counted on Jorgensen 's single . Then Drews vacated for a pinch-hitter and Spud Chandler , veteran righthander with the questionable arm , became the Yankee pitcher in the fourth . Spud promptly tumbled into diff icuties and yielded two runs . Stanky and Furillo drew passes and presently each galloped home as Walker and Hermanski weighed in with a pair of singles . It looked like a rout . Little did any one dream the Dodgers would be panting furiously and needing all those nine runs before they could call the day their own . For this struggle was to go 3 steamed and the tension increased Hatten walked Lindell and a mo ment later saw DiMaggio drive the ball high into the upper left field stand . It was jolting Joe ' : fourth circuit blow in world series competition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave way to VI strapping Branca , whom the Yank so unceremonously had routed the series opener . Branca still had a 9-6 lead as h ( held the Bombers runless for the rest of the fifth . But he dropped a run in the sixth in which he had a trying time getting out of difficulties . Bobby Brown , hitting for Chandler , doubled to right and scored on a two-bagger by Tommy Henrich that caromed off Stanky 's glove and rolled into right field . In the wake of that there were passes to DiMaggio and George to fill the bases with two out , but Branca regained his grip by inducing Johnson to pop up for the third out . More Trouble for Branca Big Ralph was to receive another jolt in the seventh with one down , the solidly built Berra batted for Lollar , inasmuch as the Brooklyn pitching had become right-handed and Yogi swings from the left side . However , he had n't swung much in the series from any side , having been held hitless in the first two games at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his slump with a resounding report . He hammered the ball over the right-field scoreb6ard , and the Yankees trailed by only one , 9 to 8 . Incidentally that was the seventy-second Yankee home run in world series competition , two more than the entire National League has hit from 1903 to date . The Berra clout ended Branca 's stay on the mound , and from the bull pen lumbered* Big Casey . He quickly snuffed out the next two batters . fri the meantime Page , who had nailed down the opener for the Yanks when he replaced Frank Shea in the sixth , was hurling for the Bombers . He appeared in the sixth , and while hib pitching was not exactly flawless it did hold Brooklyn scoreless . Lindell Singles ' in Eighth Casey 's supreme effort developed in the eighth which he opened by aralking Henrich . When Lindell Followed with a single that advanced Henrich to seconti with nobody out the Flock 's favorite relief hurler looked in a tight spot indeed , for the next hitter was Di= Maggio , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Casey baffled Jolting Joe , who swung softly at a pitch , as if meaning to push it into right . It got no further than Stanky , who scooped up the grounder , tagged Lindell as the latter sped to second hours 5 minutes , longest nineinning game in world series history , and there were few dull moments at any stage . Beginning. , with the third , the Bombers resolutely began battling their way back . In that round their first offensive thrust against the southpaw Hatten yielded two runs . Lollar singled to center and Allie Clark , batting for Raschi , walked . Two outs followed , but big John Lindell and DiMaggio lashed out with singles to center and the Yankee offensive was in motion . In the fourth they -- jolted Hatten for two more . Billy Johnson drew a pass and carried in the first on Lollar 's second hit , a double to right . Then Lollar counted on George Stirnweiss ' single to center . Into the fifth the Yankees and then tossed to first , doubling up DiMaggio . Lindell vigorously contended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell on deaf ears while Lindell 's own rang with the jeers of chortling Flatbush rooters . Henrich , of course . was lurking on third , but promptly ended the inning by grounding to Robinson . So uncanny was Casey 's relief work then that just before his pitch to he was seen motioning to his first sacker to be ready for the expected play , That proved the last stab for the Bombers . Casey snuffed out three in a row in the ninth although , Berra just missed keeping the long battle alive with another hit when his drive glanced off Casey 's glove . However , the ball bounced over to Stanky , whose toss to Robinson ended it and the crowd , which more than three hours previously had seen Mayor William O'Dwyer toss out the first ball , breathed a great sigh of relief .
