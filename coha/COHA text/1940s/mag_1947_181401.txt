The atmosphere is full of vibrations that are too feeble to be felt . No one knows where the vibrations come from or what starts them . Last week , backed by $25,000 from the weather-minded U.S. Navy , the Rev. James B. Macelwane , S.J. , St. Louis University , a tubby , genial priest who is one of the world 's best seismologists , was laying plans to find out . <P> Father Macelwane discovered the air vibrations ten years ago when testing a colleague 's theory that small tremors in the earth ( microseisms ) are caused by changes in the atmosphere . He built an oversized barometer which makes a wiggly line on a strip of paper to indicate minute variations of air pressure . Sometimes , he found , the line was almost straight . Then a " microbarographic storm " would sweep across St. Louis . For hours or even days , the line would jump up and down in jagged peaks and valleys . The mysterious little waves seemed to have no immediate connection with weather changes , wind velocity or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves , Father Macelwane is going to set up three of his microbarographs in a triangle measuring several hundred feet to a side . By comparing the records of the three instruments he can measure the waves , and tell what direction they come from . His next step will be a larger triangle flanked by other instruments hundreds of miles from St. Louis . This attempt to match the atmospheric vibrations to changes in the weather may produce a new and valuable method of weather forecasting ( the Navy has bet its $25,000 on the possibility that it will ) . Father Macelwane , though hopeful , is as cautious about his work as any other scientist : " We do n't know what the vibrations are or what causes them . We just know they are present .
