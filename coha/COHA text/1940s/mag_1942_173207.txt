From TIME 'S Louisville correspondent , Michael Griffin , came this appraisal of U.S. morale last week . <P> There is no question about the boomtown aspects of the U.S. You see it everywhere , particularly in Louisville , which has been a boom town for two years . If the war ended today with a victory for us , the mass of folks here could truthfully say that the war was the best thing to happen in their lives . They have more of everything and they are getting more every day . <P> The store windows are full of bargains and all day long radio announcers chant of good buys . Bars are booming . Bookies are coining money . Streets are literally packed , mostly with women who obviously have seen much worse times , leading two or three kids and all of them loaded down with packages . <P> Now , does all of this mean that the people are not aware of any danger , that they do n't know what it is all about ? I do n't think so . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are willing to do anything to win this war . They are not apathetic and dumb . <P> What is the matter with them , then ? <P> They are full of doubts about their leadership . People have been cynical about officeholders for years , but in peacetime they merely talked about it casually ; after all , it did n't make a great deal of difference . They always believed that when the chips were down the leaders would quit playing politics and get in there and pitch . But the chips are down now and the shenanigans continue , from high places on down . So the people say : " The hell with it . I 'm going to get mine while the getting is good . " <P> If this country gets whipsawed into a spot where it ca n't win this war , because there has n't been a mass effort , it will mean that the democratic system has failed . Not the people . The system . Not the leaders , either , although they may be directly to blame . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mass effort . The trouble seems to be they ca n't convince their leaders of that fact . <P> Some examples of what 's wrong : <P> &gt; I stopped at a restaurant in a tiny Indiana town . A soldier was in the place , a nice-looking boy . He told me he operated the place , but was drafted . He said : " It 's all right . I 'll leave all of this it was just one room because I think it is my duty . Of course . I found out after I was drafted that a man can get out of it if he has the money . " <P> I know that you ca n't buy your way out , but the point is , he thought you could . <P> There has been a great increase in the discussion of religion in letters to the editor of the Courier-Journal and Times . Why ? Is it the war alone ? I do n't think so ; I think a big reason is that people , some people , find comfort in turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leadership . And just the other day Walter Lippmann , discussing that professor who wrote the piece in Collier 's about cutting and assembling a new democratic world , said " he the professor is the product of an academic system in which the study of moral wisdom has been abandoned . " I , as a fairly normal American , agree wholeheartedly.
