txt Ice breaking boats arc entering the last round in the biggest fight ever made to open the Great Lakes to navigation . Smashing its way through what old timers here say is the worst lake tee they can recall , the Sainte Marie . " Queen " of the ice breakers , reached the Soo Canal and was locked through early yesterday . This is nearly a month later than last year 's operations which began March 22 The Sainte Marie is now slowly ' cutting a channel through the 80 miles of ice that is packed at the lower end of Lake Superior . Some shipping men here think it may take a week or longer to overcome this ice and open the route to the iron ranges on Lake Superior Ice is also heavily packed off Buffalo at the foot of Lake Erie . Hold Key to Iron Ore Supply The speed with which these sturdy boats finish the fight against the ice will be a big factor in determining whether there is enough iron ore to keep the country 's steel mills at capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ** or the iron ore used in this country is mined in the Upper Lakes regions and moves over this fresh waterway to the steel mills at or near Lower Lake ports . Because of the ice , ore shipments by the end of this month are expected to amount to only about 1.000.000 tons . Last year , when ice conditions were unusually favorable . March-April shipments were 8.581,740 tons . With ore consumption currently at a record rate of about 7.700.000 tons monthly . thin would mean starting the shipping season with a handicap equivalent to nearly a month 's supply of the red mineral It will he a hard obstacle to overcome , because the shipping goal this year is 95 million tons , three million tons more than the peak movement of 1942 . The ice also holds up movement of other commodities over the Lakes . Transportation of coal , which goes from Lower to Upper Lake ports for railroad . industrial and household use in the West . is being delayed .

It 's costly to keep a boat with a full crew tied up at the dock . waiting for channels to be cut through the ice . It may damage boats , by denting their plates or binding propellers . Trouble in June of 1917 Even when a channel has been cut through the ice , the danger is not over . A heavy wind may fill the channels and seal ships in the ice In 1917. when the Soo opened on April 17 , floating ice continued , and on June 6 a gale packed it so thick in Duluth het bor that 17 L essels w ere locked tight . On June 15 of that year , mariners reported icebergs that extended 70 feet under water in Whitefish Bay , at the lower end of Lake Superior .

Two or three more tugs and two Coast Guard lighthouse tenders may be pressed into ice-breaking service before the fight is over . Coast Guard officials here say This is a record number of boats for the job . The average person knows little about breaking ice beyond the backbreaking job of chipping it off his front sidewalks in winter . On the Lakes . this job calls for unusual skill , perseverance to best an unpredictable and persevering foe , and hardihood to buck the intense cold and driving blizzards that usually go with the task . Early in the spring , the ice is surveyed by experts from vessel companies and the Coast Guard They determine its thickness and general condition at strategic points Two Coast Guard airplanes this year were also used to check the extent of the lee . When the ice is -- ripe.

The Sainte Marie is a wide boat , as Lake vessels go . She has a beam of 62 feet . and is 25b feet long . This width enables her to cut a wide enough channel for almost any boat on the Lakes to go through . Tugs and other boats that help with the ice-breaking job trim the edges of the channels to help keep them clear . They also help to clear harbors Even this lighter work , however can be perilous . Last summer , for example , the tug Iowa was following about 100 yards behind a freighter .

This movement may cause the middle strip between lanes to close up one of the channels . Freighters , unlike the car ferries , are built to carry a maximum cargo rather than to stand great ice Ares ' sure so they are vulnerable to the ice action . lee Slows Soo Locks Traffic The fight against ice is a aged also at the Soo Loc ks , which are built for summer opera ' non . When northerly winds cause the ice to flow tow aid the lock gates , steamers must be assisted by tugs in order to get into their locks . To operate the lock gates , ice has to be poled away from the gates by hand , a very slow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been as many as 90 ships waiting in turn to pass down through the locks Car l 0 F.ydholm , fleet captain for the Cleveland Cliffs Iron Co estimates that during the 1942 season the equivalent of two million tons of ore that lake freighters otherwise might have hauled were lost because of delays caused by this ice condition at the Soo . Ice breaking permitted the opening of shipping to Escanaba , the only ore port on Lake Michigan , on Apt II 3 this year . Escanaba can be reached from lower Lake ports without going through the Soo . Weather has been so cold at this Lake Michigan port , however . that loading of ore so far this year has progreased at a snail 's pace . When the ore is frozen , it must be thawed but the steaming equipment at Escanaba is reported to be so antiquated it does a very inefficient job . About a dozen boats awaited cargoes all last week at Escanaba because of unfavorable loading conditions . However , to make up for the slow anen t:1g , about 11 ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May 1 on that was hauled in 1942. if the 95 million ton goal is met . During the season , 16 vessels now under construction are to be added to the fleet . Several boats normally engaged in carrying other commodities are also expected to join the ore fleet . All these vessels , however , will provide a capacity only about 9 ' above that at the close of the 1942 shipping season . Despite a backlog of ore from last yea r , steel makers will be pinched for ore next spring if shipments fall much behind the 95 million ton goal . On April 1 , stocks of ore at lower lake porta amounted to 25 million tons , about 5 million tons above April 1 , 1942 . While the biggest ice troubles usually are encountered in the spring . hazardous conditions may also be met at the close of the season In November , 1926 , for example , 247 boats were frozen in the ice in the vicinity of the Soo .
