There are only a handful of women golf pros in the U. S. Onetime U. S. Champion Helen Hicks Harb , Kansas City 's hardy , 48-year-old Opal Hill and Washington 's young Helen Dettweiler exhibit their talents at country clubs to promote Wilson golfing equipment . Husky Helen MacDonald , onetime wife of a Chicago pro , runs a golf school . Babe Didrikson Zaharias , famed 1932 Olympic track star , travels around with her husband , Wrestler George Zaharias , gives exhibitions . <P> Last week this select sorority initiated a new member , freckled-faced , redheaded Patty Berg , tomboy darling of U. S. golf galleries . Still at college ( Minnesota junior ) , still naive enough to shake hands with all comers , to blush when interviewed and squeak " Gee Whillikers " when excited , 22-year-old Patty decided last week that she had had her fill of big silver cups , joined the Wilson boosters-at a salary of $5,000 a year , plus commission on " Patty Berg " clubs . <P> Henceforth , the onetime national champion , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she entered , must confine her competitive golf to the half-dozen U. S. tournaments open to women pros .
