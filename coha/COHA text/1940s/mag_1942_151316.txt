Many a mere man still flinches at the sight of the incarnadined fingernails which modern woman flaunts as a matter of course . Such anti-manicurists could derive moody satisfaction from a tale told recently in the British Medical Journal . <P> To a British doctor one day last winter came a woman with a scaly rash that covered her whole face to her ears , also appeared behind her knees . The doctor told how he finally traced the rash to its cause-the brilliant carmine nail polish used by the patient . The patches of rash at the back of the knees had him stymied , until the woman volunteered that she used colorless nail polish to stop runs in her rayon stockings . <P> In the U.S. , where many a woman stains her fingertips to such tantalizing tints as Swampfire , Lollipop , Hot Dog and Celestial Pink , dermatitis from nail polish has been frequently reported-with no effect on nail stainers . It seems that no particular polish or ingredient in the polishes is to blame . Often , too , a woman who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another .
