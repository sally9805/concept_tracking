The United Nations as usual had their ears to the ground , hoping to hear shocks and tremors from the direction of Germany . <P> The straining ears heard things which gave satisfaction . The Brsseler Zeitung admitted : " Doctor Goebbels has told truths which may come as a surprise to many . But why should n't he confess that war has become the shoe which pinches ? " Said the Frankfurter Zeitung : " We are only beginning to feel total war in the west . Home has unavoidably become part of the front . " <P> In Switzerland an eyewitness fresh from Germany told the Schweizer Bauzeitung : " Air raids have had a terrible effect . Western Germany just celebrated its 10,000th alert . Recently some towns had alerts 36 nights running . Everywhere you see destroyed houses , while factories show little damage . Factories are repaired immediately after attack , but houses are left in ruins to be rebuilt after the war . Despite all Germany 's military successes , there is no trace of confidence among the people . All they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air defense ) organization had changed its name to Selbstschutz ( self-defense ) , was conscripting everyone between 15 and 70 except cripples and pregnant women . Germany 's five stongest radio stations- ( Berlin , Luxembourg , Stuttgart , Munich and Knigsberg ) , constantly used by R.A.F. and Russian bombers to check their bearings , were ordered to stop broadcasting at sunset . <P> What caused this was not the 1,000-plane-a-night potential with which Anglo-U.S. air power may some day cripple the German war effort . Bomber Commanders Air Marshal Sir Arthur Travers Harris and Major General Carl Spaatz were doing what they could with what they had-and it was no mean bomb tonnage . The R.A.F. Bomber Command threw its big punches at night . It hurled a great 600-plane raid at Kassel ( locomotives , aircraft , engines ) , ranged 900 miles northeast to Gdynia to strike at submarines under repair . Another night it was over Nrnberg ( diesel engines for submarines , planes , tanks ) and the steel center at Saarbrcken . Again it was an airdrome in Belgium , docks at Ostend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Flying Fortresses made their seventh continental raid , proving the U.S. thesis that the high-speed , high-flying B-17s can be used in daylight raids where accuracy is greater than at night . Not a B-17 had been lost , with or without fighter escort . <P> London estimated that altogether five and a half square miles in nine German cities had been devastated , that 500 war factories had been smashed beyond speedy repair , 1,000,000 Germans driven from their homes . <P> With what she could spare from her southern front , Russia smashed at Germany with her long-range aircraft , sent some on round-trip missions of 1,800 miles . Knigsberg , Danzig and Stettin felt their fury , but what pleased Russians most was the objective farthest from home . <P> Their pilots reached Berlin , plastered targets with incendiary and explosive bombs while the Moscow radio warned Germans they could expect long nights of terror all winter .
