What had it been like ? <P> All afternoon there were signs of storm . Wall posters at Manhattan rail terminals warned that train service might soon cease . Midtown telephone switchboards glowed and twinkled with extra calls . Business firms dismissed employes hours early . In trickles , then torrents , the city 's half-million commuters headed for trains . So did thousands of nervous travelers . By 3 o'clock ( Eastern Standard Time ) , vast , gloomy Penn Station was jammed . Both levels at Grand Central were packed with rumpled , sweating , anxious crowds . <P> As the 4 o'clock strike deadline drew near , masses of people pushed and shoved for any train gate which opened . When they reached trains , many climbed in through the windows . Special after special rumbled off with passengers shoulder to shoulder in the aisles . But at 4 , the crowds stood clotted thickly as ever in the stations . For a while many stayed angrily on . But in an hour most had gone , and soon footsteps echoed emptily in the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Eastern Seaboard , the same silence . Acres of freight cars , brooding herds of grimy locomotives stood in quiet rail yards at Boston , Philadelphia , Atlanta , Jersey City . At dusk , signal lights glowed green along thousands of miles of rail . The tracks were clear-and empty . <P> Westward the Course . Hour after hour , time zone to time zone , the strike moved west . Engineers and trainmen walked quietly away from cars and locomotives in Cleveland , Memphis , Kansas City , St. Paul . Chicago , the nation 's greatest rail center , was stopped cold , like a three-ring circus halted in mid-show : 25,000 loaded freight cars stood dead on the tracks and 93,750 through passengers were marooned . Muskegon , Mich , felt the strike too : one 1911 locomotive and two wooden cars were tied up . It was the same at Fargo , N.D. ( where the Great Northern 's crack Empire Builder ground to a stop ) and at high little towns on the mountain divisions and in the yards at Los Angeles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; company executives jumped to the throttles of some name trains and ran them . Travelers on one Manhattan-bound special toasted each town they passed to keep their spirits up , arrived at Penn Station hardly able to walk . The sound of lonely locomotives only emphasized the nation 's paralysis . During the 48 hours of the strike , only 100 of the country 's 17,500 scheduled passenger trains , only 240 of 24,000 freight trains , ever turned a wheel . <P> Got a Cot ? The effects of the tie-up were immediate . Hotels brought out cots , opened lounges as dormitories ( 200,000 people were stranded in New York alone ) . Automobile traffic swelled ; crowds mobbed bus terminals and the airlines . There were runs on food stores and gas stations in dozens of U.S. cities . <P> Ringling Brothers and Barnum &; Bailey 's Circus , which had been stuck in New York during the coal strike , got stuck again-this time in Boston , while a baby giraffe was born in a tent . In Lancaster , Pa. , city firemen were routed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoses to water a trainload of 2,000 thirsty hogs . There was chicken trouble , too-hundreds of automatic incubators were hatching thousands of eggs every hour . Unable to ship the new arrivals , owners gloomily planned mass drownings.
