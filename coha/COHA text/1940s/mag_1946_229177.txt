The beaded curtain which hides Portugal from the world momentarily parted last week . It revealed trouble for Dictator Antonio de Oliveira Salazar 's regime . <P> According to Salazar 's official communique , which represented the incident as a mere teapot tempest , a young Portuguese officer broke into the cavalry barracks at Monte Pedral , in northern Portugal , and exhorted the men to follow him on a " march to glory to conquer freedom .
