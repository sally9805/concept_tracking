To a sweltering Congress last week , it seemed as if the whole wide Western world was demanding : " Daddy , I 'm tired , carry me . " <P> The feeling was probably as unreasonable as the weather , but it was just as inescapable . For daddy too was tired . His back ached from the strain , he was feeling economic chills , and he was running into debt . Life was just one crisis after another , bearing ugly , stubby nicknames like ERP and MAP . <P> For a while , in the first hopeful months of Marshall Plan aid , Congress was able to congratulate itself for carrying out the largest and most generous effort in the world 's history . But now it seemed that those five billions would not be enough . Great Britain had got the lion 's share of ECA help ; now she wanted at least an extra half billion this year . There were official hints that a stabilizing fund was necessary to save the pound . No sooner was the North Atlantic Treaty ratified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half in arms aid . Where would it all end ? <P> Congressional resentment showed in the horny-handed handling it gave the ECA appropriation , in the stony eye it cast on the arms program , despite an all-star presentation by Secretary of State Acheson , George Marshall and the Big Brass in summer tans . Internationalists of proven good will were as stern as hard-shelled isolationists . <P> There was obvious danger in Congress ' mood . The danger was a readiness to believe that , because the Communists had not lately taken over another country , they might never do so again . <P> But the worry was deepseated . There was concern over America 's own economy . There was a definite foreboding that the " minimum " arms program was a by-guess-and-by-God estimate wrapped in a dark warning and covered by a blank check . There was an uncomfortable suspicion that the U.S. was being suckered into a premature manning of battle stations , that U.S. weapons and money might be dissipated in driblets from Greenland to Greece . There was a nagging fear that ECA might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its feet . There was also a petulant feeling that Europe should get off its hunkers . Elder Statesman Bernard Baruch seemed to share this mood . Back from a quick trip to Europe , he was asked whether Europe might help itself more if the U.S. helped it less . " There 's a heap of sense in that , " he said .
