WITHIN the next few years , the CIO Political Action Committee , the act that nearly stole the show in the 1944 Presidential campaign , may become the most powerful vote-herding and lobbying organization in the country . It now has prestige , cohesive organization , political know-how , and formidable resources both in money and in manpower . On the other hand , PAC may , like Labor 's Non-Partisan League , its dismantled predecessor as the political arm of the CIO , fizzle out almost as spectacularly as it rose . Labor 's Non-Partisan League , which is now forgotten but which in 1936 was viewed with almost as much alarm and hope as PAC in 1944 , eventually fell victim to the various schisms in the CIO and in the labor movement as a whole . Those schisms still exist , and Franklin D. Roosevelt , who had more power in the labor movement from 1933 to 1945 than any man on the unions ' payrolls , is no longer on hand to heal them . In the uncertainties that surround a suddenly changed situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAC is a bundle of ifs . As of the moment , however , it is labor 's greatest venture innational politics , and still on the offensive . The case for a bright future for PAC does not rest wholly on its performance last year . Actually , no one has fully assayed its operations in 1944 , and in the naturc of things it is almost impossible to do so . PAC is not a party but a pressure group ; as such , it operates below the political surface , where its influence merges with that of other pressure groups . Expert opinions on its work last year range from those of several who , like Thomas L. Stokes , one of the best political analysts in the country , have maintained that President Roosevelt would have lost the election without the help he got from PAC , to those of other observers who believe that PAC merely got credit for a lot of votes that would have gone to the President anyway . For a new movement , PAC unquestionably did very well by itself , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was not the less helpful because it was mostly unfavorable . Whether its power merited all the publicity PAC got no one really knows . In a few cases it was demonstrably a decisive force . At the Democratic National Convention it was , to be sure , unable to get the VicePresidential nomination for Henry Wallace , but it was able to veto several other candidacies , notably that of James A. Byrnes . In Michigan , where PAC was particularly active and where President Roosevelt squeezed through by 1,103,000 votes as against Governor Dewey 's 1,082 , 000 , it seems clear that if PAC was effective at all , it was effective enough to account for the 21,000 votes that put the state in the Roosevelt column , where it had not been in 1940 . There were probably other cases in which PAC provided the balance of power . It can at least be doubted , however , if its influence in the country as a whole was decisive , either in the sense of being of itself responsible for the President 's re-election or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If all , or nearly all , of the administration 's victories had been in urban centers , it would be easy to believe that PAC 's doorbell ringers had done the trick . This was not the case . Three of the most impressive New Deal victories were the renomination of Senator Claude Pepper in Florida , the defeat of Senator Gerald P. Nye in North Dakota , and the defeat of Representative Hamilton Fish in New York State . There is no labor vote worth mentioning in Florida , North Dakota , or the Rip Van Winkle country , where Fish ran . PAC could have influenced votes in those sections only by buying them but if Sidney Hillman and the Congressional committees that investigated his accounts bear truthful witness , PAC was not spending its money that way . Similarly in the case of the Presidential vote : Roosevelt was somewhat stronger than he was expected to be in the large cities and factory towns , a fact for which PAC must deserve most of the credit . At the same time he was a good deal stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , a fact that would seem to suggest that 1944 , PAC or no PAC , was down in the books as a Roosevelt year . But all this scarcely matters now . PAC today has the prestige of association with victory . Most of the men it marked for defeat were defeated ; most of those it sought to elect were elected . PAC announced that it was going to break up the Dies Committee ; Mr. Dies did n't dare run for re-election , and other members of his committee are now sulking in several states . Even if PAC 's part in bringing such things to pass had been that of a rainmaker blessed by a cloudburst , the professional politicians would have to assume that PAC , as the major outside force at work in the campaign , was the cause of so many unexpected effects . Local party bosses throughout the country believe that in PAC they have a new force to contend with . Somebody new is getting out the vote . II Ts PAC really a new force ? In the his- torical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country before there were any trade unions of consequence . In 1828 fifteen states had labor parties , some of which wielded considerable influence , particularly in Philadelphia and New York . The early labor movement played a not insignificant part in the establishment of our public school systems . Samuel Gompers , however , would have nothing to do with the notion of a labor party , nor would he let the American Federation of Labor bind itself to either of the major parties . Yet he saw that labor could not afford to neglect politics , and the formula he gave the AFL in 1886 is the same one that PAC has adapted to its own purposes today . For sixty years the AFL has worked on the principle that it should stay out of partisan politics but that it should use the franchise of its members " to punish our enemies and rcward our friends , " regardless of party . The technique has been effective if the lengths to which candidates have gone to get AFL endorsements are any measure . Moreover , the AFL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republicans have been most firmly in the saddle , to head off federal anti-labor legislation by threatening reprisals at the polls . The Open Shop campaigns of the National Association of Manufacturers , carried on through several Republican administrations , came a cropper , at least so far as sympathetic legislation was concerned , because of the AFL 's political strength . The main trouble labor had in those days was with the judiciary , and the Norris ? LaGuardia Anti-Injunction Law , passed under Hoover and signed by him , took care of the courts to a large degree . No doubt the Norris ? LaGuardia Act got the votes of many Congressmen who were contrary-minded but who felt that they had good reason to fear the wrath of the AFL at the next election . The AFL has never wanted much from government , but it has got most of what it wanted , and its political means have thus been adequate to its ends . In setting up PAC , the CIO is not departing from the Gompers writ in any fundament-1 way . Like the AFL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and supports the regular candidates whose voting records are most acceptable to it . However , PAC will give the old formula a more intensive application than it has ever had in the past . As some philosopher has said , a change in degree , when great enough , becomes in effect a change in kind , and PAC 's adaptation of the Gowpers formula can conceivably have an enormous effect on national policy and on our political alignments . The AFL plays its politics rather casually . its leaders merely advise the members that it is in the interests of the unions that certain candidates be elected and certain others defeated . This is done through the regular union channels . The AFL 's only full-time political employees are its Washington lobbyists . PAC , however , is a national machine , a whole new apparatus outside the regular union structure ; set up not only to keep CIO members advised of their political interests but to shepherd them to the polls and registering places . PAC is organized on a ward by ward , precinct by precinct , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finance such organization . In many places , like Detroit , where it was reported to have had 7 ; 500 full-time workers in the weeks before the last election , it is far more elaborately staffed than the local party machine which it parallels . The AFL has never publicized its endorsements , and it has rarely tried to corral any votes except those of its own members . PAC , on the other hand , will canvass whole communities wherever it can , and it has one of the largest and smartest publicity bureaus in the country . The 57,000,000 copies of its fourteen pamphlets which it scattered throughout the country last summer and autumn were as smartly produced as any political propaganda in American history ( as the accompanying illustrations indicate ) . Joseph Gaer , who wrote most of them , is a genius at popularization ; before coming to PAC he had written for the layman on such varied and recondite subjects as meteorology , comparative religion , and the social security laws . His stuff was so good that the Democratic National Committee took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of the material the Democrats used against Dewey came from a pamphlet that PAC , on the job months before Dewey 's nomination , had gathered . PAC will ask far more of the candidates who seek its endorsement than the AFL ever asked . The AFL has never taxed a politician on his attitude toward anything but legislation directly affecting trade unions . Thus it was able in the last election to support such opponents of its own foreign policy as Representative Stephen A. Day of Illinois , Senator Nye , Hamilton Fish , and Martin Dies , all of whom had good labor records . The CIO demanded not only that a candidate vote its way on legislation affecting labor but also that he support the New Deal in all its phases . In part this was because it is genuinely less parochial in its outlook than the AFL , but in part also it is because President Roosevelt was the special patron of the CIO and because it owes its existence very largely to the New Deal . PAC 's insistence on placing support of the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it has been forced to choose between the two , led to some contradictions as curious as those of the AFL , one of them being the support it is giving Mayor Hague of Jersey City , who used to order his police to take care of CIO organizers by cracking them over the head with nightsticks . Twice in the last year there have been opportunities to unseat . Hague ? first , by endorsing a new state constitution that would pull out the props from under him and , second , by supporting a coalition movement that is the only formidable opposition Hague has ever had to face . PAC has not only refrained from supporting these movements but has actively opposed them on the ground that Hague 's congressmen vote PAC 's way on national and international issues , which is quite true . As a PAC spokesman explained : In politics there are no vacuums ; once you smash the Hague machine , something has to replace it . The CIO does n't want to smash it now because the CIO is afraid the replacement would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues . 1 . Y FAR the most significant of PAC 's innovations is its determination to get out the vote for primary as well as generalelections . A pressure group that can bargain with votes in the general elections can wring many concessions from candidates but not half so many as one that can muster effectives for the primaries , which are the wellsprings of power in our political system . This is a fact that no amount of education or experience seems to have taught the amateurs in politics , but PAC has apparently grasped it welt . Moreover , it is in a position to do something about it . No matter what estimate one places on PAC 's present vote-herding powers , only a fraction of those it prodded to the polls last year are needed to give it great influence in the party machines . " If you got more than five primary votes , " said the late Senator George Washington Plunkitt of New York , a man whose informal lectures on practical politics are not widely enough known as the Machiavellian discourses of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take bids on them from all sides . " This was said fifty years ago , but the voting figures in the primaries are still far lower than most citizens imagine , and a small , well-organized force can work wonders in them . Sidney Hillman says that the CIO vote is 14,000,000 , a sanguine estimate arrived at apparently by taking it for granted that the 5,500,000 dues-paying members claimed by the CIO can account , among their families and friends , for another 8,500,000 votes . The original figure of 5,500,000 is unquestionably exaggerated . Yet even if it is cut to 4,000,000 and we assume that only one in four of the regular members can become sufficiently aroused to vote in the primaries , PAC would still have a clear balance-of-power strength in thousands of places throughout the country . Getting people to register in parties and vote in primaries is far easier to talk about than to accomplish , but PAC may succeed . Not only is it organized to do the job precisely as the party bosses do it , but it can spend nearly all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connally Act , which prohibits labor unions from spending their funds on general elections , says nothing at all about the primaries . The CIO lawyers , with the approval so far of the Attorney General , have taken this to mean that PAC can shoot the works on the primaries so long as it locks up its funds once the candidates are named and the campaign is on . ( In order to do this and still have funds available for the general elections , the National Citizens ' Political Action Committee , which technically is not affiliated with the CIO and is therefore not subject to the Act , was established last year . The NC-PAC will raise funds independently and will carry the financial burden once the primaries are over . ) If PAC is able to bring 1,000,000 disciplined voters to the primaries , there is no reason why it will not be in a position to tell the party bosses in sections where its strength is at all formidable what to do and where to go if they fail to do it . And if PAC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bosses should not listen . III Prim prospect of PAC mobilizing for the primaries , in which the control of party machinery is determined , has caused many persons to assume that the CIO is out to become a political power itself and wants to take over the reins of government and party management wherever it can . " Will the CIO Capture the Democratic Party ? " the Saturday Evening Post asked itself last summer , and answered that it probably would if President Roosevelt were re-elected . It all depends upon what is meant by " capture . " PAC wants the Democratic Party ? with which , despite its official non-partisanship , it will inevitably do most of its business ? to be deeply enough in its debt so that the administration will sponsor government policies which PAC favors . It is most unlikely , however , that it will ever want , or would even accept , direct political responsibility . Psychological likenesses between business men and labor leaders have been noted before , and they apply to politics as much as to anything else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for their businesses ' sake . They are not interested in winning public offices ; they are already gainfully employed , and if they contribute to a campaign fund or go lobbying in Washington , they do so because they are eager to promote government policies that will favor their business or to stop policies that will hamper them . They would just as soon leave the politics , a grubby job at best , to the professionals . Labor leaders are no different . Indeed , one reason why we have never had a national labor party is the reluctance of professional labor leaders to take political responsibility . Most of them are scared stiff by the thought of running for public office . Among other things , they are afraid that some day they might get elected , in which case they would be forced to exchange secure union jobs for the gamble of politics . This has been the experience of the American Labor Party , which represents PAC in New York State . On several occasions the ALP has been in a position to place men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate salaries , but it has almost invariably had to go outside the ranks of the professional labor leaders to find anyone willing to run the risk of leaving his job long enough to fill a public office or even to campaign for one . When , in 1942 , the ALP decided to enter its own candidate for governor , it peddled the nomination through all the unions in New York and could find no takers . After combing a long list of college professors , doctors , and writers , it finally settled for a young and obscure lawyer , not even a member of the party , who was willing to make the run . To be sure , the CIO , like everyone else , is playing politics for what it can get out of it . " Politics , " said one of PAC 's pamphlets , " is the science of who gets what , and how " ? a callous but accurate definition which Governor Dewey never tired of quoting in outraged innocence . But PAC wants the fruits , not the means , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the professional politicians with votes , and PAC , by its basic organization as a pressure group , recognizes the cash-and-carry nature of our political system . Our political parties are not , like those of some countries , primarily concerned with philosophies of government or public issues . They are primarily concerned with getting themselves into office by the manipulation of public issues . If this were not true , the major parties could not have switched places on the states-rights issue as they so readily did a decade ago . A party 's policy goes to the pressure group , or groups , that can bid highest with votes , and PAC is bidding , with the votes of union members , for policies which it believes will favor the trade-union business . But it would just as soon leave the means of power in the hands of the professional politicians . It is worth noting , in this connection , that even its own staff is made up more of hired politicians and professional administrators than of labor leaders . C. B. Baldwin , who ran everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government career man , and two of his chief assistants were former Congressmen Raymond McKeough of Illinois and Thomas Amlie of Wisconsin . V IEWED abstractly , in terms of its pres- ent resources in manpower , prestige , and organization , PAC 's future is bright . This , however , is not the whole story . It was one thing for PAC to mobilize hordes of union members in support of President Roosevelt and the New Deal ; it may prove quite another matter now that Roosevelt is out of the picture . For almost thirteen years he was a magic symbol to the American workingman , and when any union official asked a union member to get out and vote for the President there was no question of CIO dictation ; it was merely a reminder to do what he in any case believed to be the proper thing . Whether he will give the same sort of loyalty to President Truman , Henry Wallace , or anyone else is problematical . It may be that from now on the class lines in American politics will be sharply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not persuasion , to get the most out of the labor vote . It is a fact beyond question , though , that up to now American labor has been fiercely independent in its politics . Union members have refused to take any political bossing from union leaders , who have generally been regarded by the rank-and-file merely as men hired to represent their interests before employers , just as lawyers are hired to represent their clients ' interests before the courts , and not to give them any sort of moral or political leadership . There is evidence of this attitude on every hand . John L. Lewis 's attempts to get the miners behind Willkie and Dewey in the last two Presidential campaigns contrast revealingly with his success in leading them in their union battles . In 1936 Sidney Hillman successfully led most of the New York members of his union , the Amalgamated Clothing Workers , into the American Labor Party ; in 1942 , Hillman got into a factional fight with other ALP leaders and tried to pull the tailors back out of the party . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote was higher than ever before . Early in April Walter Reuther , a popular official of the United Automobile Workers , ran for a scat on the school board in Detroit , PAC 's strongest city . He came in last in a field of ten . David Dubinsky , head of the International Ladies ' Garment Workers and one of the frankest and most intelligent men in the labor movement , has said that he does not believe he could control more than ten per cent of the vote of his own union members , most of whom are highly political and devoted to Dubinsky . The figure would probably be lower in most unions . So far PAC has shown only that it can mobilize the labor vote , and it seems in a good position to deploy it strategically in the primaries . It has not yet shown that it can direct it . Possibly it can , but it will face its real test now that President Roosevelt can no longer symbolize or define the issues . And if the coming postwar quest for normalcy breeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , labor may he indifferent or it may be as divided as the red-headed vote . IV Fr o SURVIVE the loss of Franklin D. Roosevelt , PAC will , in all probability , need not only new symbols but a new administration of its own . Sidney Hillman was chosen to lead PAC not because of his political experience ? aside from some local campaigning in New York he has had none ? but because of his entree with the New Deal . Hillman is one of the most curious figures in the labor movement . His standing in the two fields of organized labor and practical politics can be compared , not too unfairly , with the strange reputation of the politician described , I believe , by Carl Sandburg : in Washington they thought he was a big man from Rhode Island , and in Rhode Island they thought he was a big man from Washington . In politics , Hillman is an amateur who has been courted because of his supposed influence ' in the labor movement ; in the labor movement , he has prospered because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of fact , Hillman is more of a social worker than anything else , and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers is as much a social-welfare agency as it is a union . Its wage standards are the lowest in the needle-trades , but it abounds in such fancy gadgets as banks , cultural programs , insurance schemes , and housing projects , all of which have endeared Hillman to a whole generation of reformers , among whom he is often referred to as " a labor statesman . " IIillman first became nationally prominent during the Wilson administration , when his reformer friends saw to it that manufacturers of Army uniforms signed contracts with the Amalgamated . When the same reformers came back into power in 1933 , his stock rose again , and it has mounted through the last decade . He was a natural selection as PAC 's leader so long as he was able to carry on negotiations with the ward-heelers through someone who understood both their mentality and his . Persons who understand both mentalities are rare , and Franklin D. Roosevelt was one of the few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truman , whose nomination as Vice-President it for a time opposed at Chicago , it will need new leadership and considerable reorganization . The loss of Earl Browder might prove as serious a blow to PAC as the loss of President Roosevelt . This is not to suggest that there was any connection between the two , nor is it to say , with Westbrook Pegler , that Communists control PAC . They do not . Sidney Hillman knows them well and does not care for them . He threw them out of the New York State CIO five years ago and out of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers fifteen years before that . Hillman has deliberately kept Communists out of PAC 's top leadership . He is , however , nothing if nut practical , and his personnel policy for PAC has been to hire no known Communists and no known anti-Communists . From his point of view , this is sound procedure . If the Communists support a cause , they toil in its vineyards longer and harder than anyone else , no matter whether they are accepted , reviled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when they disbanded their own party last year , to throw their full weight behind PAC , and PAC did not revile them . Wisely enough , it accepted them . The full weight of the Communists can be estimated at somewhere between 50,000 and 75,000 tireless workers who are content with their station in the rank and file . Like any other political machine , PAC needs as many such people as it can get , and there can be no question but that a great deal of the ginger in PAC 's 1944 campaign was supplied by the Communists , who gave themselves to PAC because their leaders and PAC 's were , for the time being at any rate , going the same way . But if either one should leave the path , PAC would be the loser . How great its loss would be can no more be estimated than its full strength , but some indication of what the Communists can do when they set their minds to it and are not burdened by their own reputation can be gleaned from last year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only place where any PAC votes were registered on a separate line , that of the American Labor Party . Two years ago the ALP , which had been based on a restive but workable co-operation between Communist and non-Communist labor leaders , split wide open . The issue was thrashed out in a primary fight , which the Communists won hands down . The losers abandoned the ALP machinery and set up their own party . PAC , however , retained the ALP as its New York representative , and the ALP , staffed almost solely by Communists , was able to round up 494,405 votes , or 8 per cent of the New York total . Of course , only a small percentage of these voters were themselves Communists ; the great majority would not have voted on the ALP line if William Z. Foster 's name had been there in place of Franklin D. Roosevelt 's . But that is not the point . The Communists were the backbone of PAC 's doorbell-ringing staff in New York , as they most certainly were in many , though not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no longer in their interests to work with PAC , it might very well find itself in the position of a general staff whose crack troops were in open rebellion . M OST of all , the future of PAC depends upon the future of the CIO itself . The CIO , which has survived five difficult years and prospered through five good ones , may now seem a permanent fixture in American life . In point of fact , its existence will be more in doubt during the next five years than it ever was during the first five . The CIO-AFL wars that raged through the late Thirties were suspended when the national defense program began in 1940 , and in areas of jurisdictional dispute the status quo was frozen . But like wartime wages and contracts , it was frozen to no one 's particular satisfaction and for the duration only . Open warfare will be resumed when reconversion comes , and the CIO , as its leaders well know , will be in anything but an advantageous position . Three factors accounted for the rise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was better adapted to many unorganized industries than the AFL 's craft unionism ; a federal government that not only provided the legal basis for new organizing drives but often took sides with the CIO in its disputes with the parent body ; and the enormous financial backing which it got from the richest and strongest union in the country , the United Mine Workers . Without industrial unionism , of course , the CIO would have had no reason to exist . Without a sympathetic administration , its way would have been harder , but at least it could have made the try . Without the funds supplied by the UMW , however , the CIO could never have started . Capital is as essential to the organization of workers into a union as it is to the organization of the industries in which they work , and the campaigns of the CIO in steel , automobiles , rubber , and other large industries were made possible by the money which John L. Lewis , then the CIO 's president , had in the treasury of the United Mine Workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Few unions make public their assets and liabilities or the ways in which funds are divided between offices . Still , it requires no inside knowledge to foresee the general situation after the war . For over half a century the AFL has been collecting high dues and initiation fees . It has always had tremendous resources , and it has been cautious in undertaking new organizing campaigns . The CIO collects low dues and initiation fees are often nonexistent . Its outgo is proportionately farhigher than the AFL 's . For its number of dues-paying members , the CIO 's staff is almost twice that of the AFL 's . For seven years the CIO could count on the UMW 's millions , but since Lewis resigned in 1942 , the UMW 's money has not only been unavailable to the C/0 but has actually been used against it . True , the CIO has money coming in from war workers now ; which has enabled it to keep going without Lewis . But the AFL has also been taking its cut ? worker for worker a far heavier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CIO will be by far the heavier loser . No matter how close we come to full employment , industries such as shipbuilding , aircraft , and steel , all of which are now CIO strongholds , are bound to discharge workers by the hundreds of thousands . The AFL , however , with its strength based largely on carpenters , painters , plumbers , and other such highly paid workers will not stand to lose too greatly . Indeed , a post-war building boom , which most economists foresee as the most likely way of taking up the slack during the reconversion period , will actually profit the AFL , for it has clear control of all the construction trades . ' THE CIO will be fighting for its life .11. when the war is over , and PAC 's future will obviously rest on the outcome of that fight . But it is perhaps more relevant to say that the CIO 's future may rest on PAC . What the CIO will lose in membership and financial strength after the war , it may be able to offset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in business , but a sympathetic administration and Congress can help greatly . According to its declaration of principles , PAC 's first aim is " the development of an abundant life for the Common Man of this earth " ; this is no doubt one of the laudable ideals of its leaders , but PAC was first organized , on July B , 1943 , to accomplish something far more modest in scope . " We must , " said Sidney Hillman , " see to it that the next Congress is too conscious of labor 's strength to pass any more Smith ? Connally Acts . " PAC 's biggest fight since the election was for the confirmation of Henry Wallace as Secretary of Commerce . It may regard Wallace 's Sixty Million Jobs as pie in the sky , but it knows that the government will have to do something to provide even forty million jobs , and where those jobs are provided , and who organizes the workers , will be of intense concern to the CIO and PAC . V p AC MAY be looked upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special-interest group , depending upon one 's attitude toward the side it is backing . In one sense , though , it can perform a real service for all sides . PAC is a national machine , and , although it will use local issues to advantage where that can be done , its principal concern is with national policy . This has never been true of our regular party machines . Neither major party is really a national organization ; both are loose federations of forty-eight state parties , representatives of which meet once in four years to name a Presidential candidate . However , the national leaders of each party have less influence over federal officeholders than the state and county leaders . Only twice in recent times ? when Mark Hanna led the Republicans and when James A. Farley led the Democrats ? have national bosses wielded any real power . If a state or county boss does not like the way a Congressman behaveshimself , he can deprive him of the nomination . If a national boss is displeased , he can only recommend such action to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendation or not as they wish . State and county bosses , of course , are absorbed in state and county affairs . Now a man votes on Dumbarton Oaks is of far less consequence to them than how well he pushes the fight for federal funds to widen Zenith River . A Congressman , in their minds , goes to Washington to represent the interests of his district . Where he gets his ideas on foreign or national policy is , as often as not , his own affair . In the 1944 Congressional elections , PAC introduced national and foreign issues into local campaigns on a larger scale than anyone has succeeded in doing in the past . Where candidates had formerly stood on their record for local improvement and faithful service to the special interests of their constituents , PAC , wherever it functioned , confronted them with their full records and forced them to defend themselves . It does not matter whether PAC 's criticisms were always just or what its motives were in any particular case . If it can bring the world into the politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Umpteenth Congressional District will be a lot the better for it , and so may the world .
