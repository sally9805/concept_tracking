Letters to The Times ' Property Restitution Austrian Authorities Said to Haw Accomplished Much Already To THE EDITOR OF THE New YORK Timm : THE NEW YORK TIMES of Nov. 27 reports that Austrian nationals of Jewish faith in Vienna have vigorously protested against a restitution law which allegedly " does not provide for the return of dwellings , business places and other property " seized in the course of Germany 's occupation of Austria . Permit me to bring some light into the matter of the restitution legislation of the Austrian parliament . On May 15 , 1946 , a federal law was enacted declaring null and void all transfers of property made during German occupation of Austria and effected for the purpose of penetrating Austria economicaslly and politically . Thus , the Austrian Government has aligned its policy of restitution with the principles of the United Nations Declaration on Forced Transfer of Property in Enemycontrolled Territory as expressed in London on Jan. 5 , 1943 . From the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem of restitution can only be effected by separate consecutive steps , since the re-establishment of legal order must be preceded by the disentanglement of legal relati6ns . Three Separate Laws Consequently , three separate laws should cover the entire subject . The first law on restitution was enacted on Oct. 13 , 1946 . It provides for restitution of property previously seized by the German Reich and now administered by the Austrian State . The second law is expected to be adopted shortly . It will provide for restitution of ' property previously seized by members of the Nazi party and war criminals and which has actually , become property of the Austrian State . The third and certainly most important part of this legislation on restitution is to cover the field of general restitution on in individual basis . This is the one that has caused most disagreement between the parties concerned and therefore necessitates most serious study if the legal basis is to be preserved . The draft of this law is still under consideration and subject to pertinent discussion . The question on inheritance rights under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descendants and progeny as well as the lawful spouse of the deceased ; brothers or sisters and their children and all other legal heirs ( provided the latter were living in a common household with the deceased ) become entitled to indemnification . In addition to these three partial laws , the Austrian Government intends to pool all property subject to restitution , but to which there are no legal successors , in a fund . Persons whose claims have been proven valid , but which can not be met , are to be indemnified out of this fund . Since Jewish property is expected to contribute the greatest share to this fund , the group of Jewish claimants will have to be considered first and in due percentage . Many Difficulties This is the actual situation in the field of restitution of Nazi-looted property ? in Austria . The Austrian authorities approached this subject with zeal and , responsibility immediately after the liberation . The difficulties which have caused delay in the solution of such an important matter are manifold . First , the subject itself demands , detailed legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Allied authorities proved to be a decisive obstacle : only four months ago the absolute veto in the Allied Council in Vienna was dropped , and unanimous rejection by the council now nullifies any Austrian legislation . Moreover , at Potsdam it was agreed that German property in Austria could become subject to Allied seizure , but no further interpretation was given as ' to what should be regarded as German property . The Austrian Government is of the opinion that only such assets as were German-owned prior to the occupation should be regarded as German property . But , as is well known , a wider interpretation is applied to the term by Soviet Russia . Naturally , if the Austrian Government is expected to make restitution of property , it must at least ? be clear first to which properties the Austrian Government is and to which it is not entitled . Much has already been accomplished . Jewish factory owners and business men have resumed their former positions in Austria . Lawyers and civil servants have again been enlisted , teachers and professors are gradually coming back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimants to see the restitution of Nazi-looted property effected soon is well understandable . But it must be said that inner-political forces of the Radical Left are increasingly taking advantage of such feelings to the detriment of the present Austrian Government . Dr. L. KLEINWACHTER , The ? Representative of the Austrian Federal Government . Washington , Nov. 29 , 1946 . Not First Civilian President To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK Thus : In your editorial on President Alemdn of Mexico you say that he is its " first clearly civilian President . " This was presumably taken from an Associated Press dispatch from Mexico City which appeared in other New York newspapers . Senor AleMan is not the first civilian President of Mexico . To mention a few who , were civilians : Benito Juarez , Sebastian Lerdo de Tejada , Francisco Leon de la Barra , Francisco I. Madero , Venustiano Carranza , Adolfo de la Huerta and Emilio Portes Gil . Also , in your caption on an Associ4t ated Press photograph showing Senor Alemin with his family , published in THE TIMES of Dec. 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden of their home , the Palacio de Belles Artes , near Mexico City . The Palacio de Belles Artes is a theatre , where he took office Sunday . EMILIO ESCALANTE . New York , Dec. 2 , 1946 . Permanent Registration Suggestion Is Opposed as Inimical to Honest Elections To TEE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK Times : In your editorial of Nov. 26 endorsing the proposal of the New York League of Women Voters for permanent personal registration of voters you say , among other things , you believe that " in. the interest of preventing fraud " we should change to permanent registration . Opportunities for fraud would be vastly increased , not diminished , by such a change . The practice would encourage increased attempts to vote deceased registrants . Corrupt and predatory political machines , once having succeeded in illegally registering floaters , would attempt to vote them repeatedly thereafter without running the risk attendant on attempts to illegally register them again each year . This form of registration would render virtually impossible an adequate check-up on voters changing their places of abode , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the challenging of legally qualified voters . The non-machine voter , when challenged at the polls , might find it difficult , if he had registered years before , to prove his eligibility in time to vote . It might permit indiscriminate fencejumping in party primaries . There have been cases in some States where annual party enrollment is not required for participation in primaries in which ward heelers of one party succeeded in defeating in another party 's primary statesmen whom they could not have defeated in the election . The League of Women Voters is undoubtedly well meaning but misguided in its proposal . Any measures for extension of the area in which annual registration of voters is not required should meet determined opposition from all who believe in honest elections . Annual registration of voters should be retained for the Protection of the people from political manipulators . RALPH WRIGHT , secretary , Allied Printing Trades Council of Greater New York . New York , Nov. 27 , 1946 . Nation-Wide Help for All Disabled To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES ; Your news report of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plans of the rival National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis to appeal for contributions next January , together with your editorial on the case of a paralyzed Army sergeant , prompts me to ask the courtesy of your columns in behalf of all disabled rather than of a few . It is not my purpose to discuss the unhappy schism between Sister Kenny and the National Foundation , to dwell upon the large program of the Federal Government for disabled veterans , nor the training of the blind , whether military or civilian . Rather , may I remind your readers that all these groups are small minorities in the vast army of disabled men and women . Yet it is only for these relatively small groups that there is any broad , integrated , nation-wide program . For the millions ? and there are millions of civilians disabled through illness or accident  --  there is no real program to restore them to health and usefulness . The truth is we do not see the tree , for the leaves and instead of thinking only of the parts we should attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a nationwide organization for all disabled instead of divided groups for a few . HAROLD A. LITTLEDALE . New York , Nov. 28 , 1946 . Hospitality to the U. N. To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK Times : In your issue of Nov. 21 I see that the Women 's National Republican Club asked twelve hundred of its members if they would extend some simple hospitality to the staffs of the various U. N. delegations . Of the twelve hundred , only fourteen ( less than one in eightyfive ) took the trouble to answer at all , and of these , only five ( or one in two hundred and fifty ) was willing to extend an invitation to any of these delegates to " tea , dinner , movies-or a weekend in the country . " Does not this suggest what will be the general attitude of the Republicans to international cooperation ? Women in New York have at least as good , if not better , sources of information on international affairs than those of other parts of the country . Duespaying members of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average . It is almost certain that if directly asked the question , the vast majority of these women would say that they believe in international cooperation , but only one in two hundred and fifty is ' willing to cut candwirh to help it alone . HERBERT PELL . New York , Nov. 24 , 1946 . Wages of City Workers Proposals for Increased Municipal Revenue Are Held Justified To THE EDITOR or Two New YORK Times:1 THE TIMES editorial of Nov. 29 on wage increases for city employes isvery much off base in its reference to proposals made by the CIO regarding these increases . It is based upon an ; incomplete account in THE TIMES of Nov. 27 of the facts presented by them New York District , United Public ) Workers of America , CIO , ? to the Mayor 's special wage committee on Nov. 26 . In the interests of accuracy and truth , these omissions which led your : . editorial writer to term our reconse mendations as " fantastic " should be , * corrected . Certainly the public is enp titled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . According to the Controller 's report . s : for the period July 1 to Oct. 30 , sales - tax collections are running well over " anticipated income . The most conservative estimates place the annual conestion at $120,000,000 , or $40,000,001:L above the original budget estimate . On the basis of the sales tax alone the city can afford ** for wage in- ' ; creases . Raising Tax Bate We recommended the raising of the tax rate to provide additional revenues . " The unused amount that could be de. ? rived from this source for the year ; - , 1946-47 alone is $53,300,000 . We pointed out that while we are conducting no , : vendetta against the real estate inter --  " eats , it is undeniable that real estate is ' enjoying flush prosperity and is in A , ' favorable position , as evidenced by the following facts : The increased value of real estate  - -  is in the last analysis based upon the vital services rendered by city ern- , ployes . The true index of real estate 's prol-Iperity is indicated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of assessed valuations , with loft buildings selling at 112 per cent and office buildings selling at 104 per cent , in -- comparison to ratios of 70 to 90 per cent that existed in previous years . We therefore recommended that , in , , view of this unequaled prosperity and. , in view of the new values created because of remodeling and reconstruction , . , , it should be possible to increase as-r. sessed valuation by approximately a " billion dollars . We contended further : that real estate is able to pay for the services rendered to them by the city's. ; workers because they are now paying ; $41,000,000 less in taxes than theyi , were paying in 1939-40 , when their prosperity was much lower . We also recommended that fiscal re- , lationships between the city and State : : be modified in favor of the city , in view of the fact that Your editorial later states " The city ( , has to pay a decent living wage to these employes . " We agree that the city should pay a decent living wage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 62 per cent increase in the cost of liv- ing since 1939 . During this same pe-:x riod they have received wage increases " averaging 10 to 15 per cent . To restore : city employes ' purchasing power to the " 1939 levels the city should pay wage increases ranging from $720 to $1,800 ? a year . CIO 's recommendation for a $600 a year increase is moderate . THE NEW YORK TIMES did . not see fit to editorialize on CIO 's charge that , : the city 's employes are pauperized be- , : cause of their low wages . The fact of - the matter is that an overwhelming : : number of the city 's workers are eligible either for home relief or for sup. ; ; , " plementary financial assistance from : - private social agencies . According to the figures of the New : : York City Budget Council , the average : " budget of the city worker is $914.40 year less than is required to maintain a minimum standard of living . The average wage of a city worker is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private industry in New York State . These stark facts arei spelling misery and starvation to tens ; , of thousands of the city 's workers .

No Consumer Resistance on Rents To THE EDIlve OF THE NEW YORK TIDIES : - A TIMES reader in a recently published letter asks why rents should not be increased a modest 15 per cent in view of skyrocketing costs of coal , plumbing , repairs , and so on . No answer should be necessary ben. - cause it is only too obvious that it has , 1 been three or four years since landlords have had vacancies that they could n't : : fill by merely announcing them . Dur.L ' : ' , ing this time " repairs " and " services ' .. , ? have been kept down to an irreducible minimum . Most important , however , is the fact that the very nature of the housing shortage makes it impossibly ' for consumer resistance , such atr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same salutary effect on -- rents .

The Mayor 's Committee on Fuel Conservation might like to have its attention called to ? one place where elec41 ' tricity can be saved . Day after day ?
