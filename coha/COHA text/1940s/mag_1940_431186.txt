To read anything well , we have to use our minds . But the process of reading does not go on in a vacuum . The external and antecedent conditions may be either favorable or unfavorable . It is hard enough for us to get the most out of what we read , without handicapping ourselves by all sorts of impediments . Obstacles to reading ? whatever interferes with extracting the greatest pleasure and profit from books ? are almost always due to the reader 's own negligence or mental inertia . Only a little care is needed to remove these obstacles and to obtain favorable conditions ? of time and place , of light and comfort , of freedom from distractions . As all the well-mannered externals of dining are an aid to digestion , so a wellarranged occasion for reading facilitates the mental exercise a good book requires . But food can not be digested unless the stomach works . So remember that you can not read with profit , even in an ideal library , unless you use your mind . A11 of us have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the first place , world events affect our daily lives . Conscription . new taxes , higher prices ? there is no getting away from the effects of Europe 's war . In the second place , we have an obligation as free Americans , living in one of the few free societies left on earth , to take advantage of the freedom we still enjoy . A free press and a free radio bring us more news and more interpretation than any other people receive . In fact , we get so much news and so much interpretation that we sometimes throw up our hands in despair . We just do n't know what to read in the newspapers and magazines , what to listen to on the radio , what to believe and what not to . Here are a few hints that may help you to get more satisfaction from the news in less time . 1 . Read a metropolitan morning paper for straight news . Most newspapers published in the larger cities have a bigger proportion of world news than papers published in smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the news than an evening paper . The reason is that news keeps pouring into a newspaper all afternoon and on into the evening . As it takes time to organize this news , the morning paper is able to do a better job . 2 . If you like interpretation better than straight news , you will generally find it in an evening paper ? because most evening papers specialize in columnists . You will be happier if you read only those columnists with whom you agree . A lot of people , of course , like to read both sides of a question ; but all of us have certain convictions and preferences or prejudices or whatever you like to call them . You will save time and nervous wear and tear if you recognize your preferences frankly and read what you like . Nobody was ever convinced by an argument , anyway . 3 . You will save time , too , if you first read all the headlines and then let your eye skim rather rapidly down the columns of type below . There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it . But if you do , you will learn two things . First , you will learn how to find quickly the news that really interests you . Second , you will soon discover that the main purpose of a headline is not to describe the story underneath ; it is to attract your attention . This is especially true of the main headline . I do n't mean to imply that headlines do not tell the truth . I am only reminding you that their main function is to sell papers . 4 . The most reliable war news appears in the so-called communiques issued by the belligerent nations . These do not always tell the whole  | truth ; but they are a lot more accurate than descriptions of battles written by correspondents or handed out by propaganda ministries or information bureaus . The trouble is that most communiques are written in highly technical language and assume a lot more knowledge than most of us possess . This is where military experts come in handy . There are a lot of good ones . Again , choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers three kinds of news coverage . The news bulletins give you exactly the same information you get in your newspaper . You get them sooner over the radio , but more complete in print , and unless you are out of reach of a newspaper , you will save a great deal of time if you stick to your morning paper for straight news , because you can almost certainly read faster than the newscaster talks . Besides , you can skip what does n't interest you . 6 . The second type is the commentator . Too often commentators just sum up the news ; but a few of them really interpret or even prophesy . Here again let your preference be your guide . If you just do n't like commentators , do n't listen to them . You will not really miss very much . 7 . The third type is the round-up of foreign and national news . This is a real innovation and the greatest contribution radio has made to helping us understand the news . These round-ups bring firsthand impressions of foreign capitals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories that do not appear in the papers or appear later in less complete form . 8 . Almost all the news we now get from abroad is censored . The only way to penetrate a censorship is to specialize in the news from some one country , or at least follow some one correspondent every day . In time , you will begin to read between the lines ; but it takes perseverance. 9 . You have heard a lot about propaganda . Propaganda is anything you read or hear that makes you start demanding some kind of action . Propaganda may be true ; it may be false . But the real test of propaganda is whether it works . To detect effective propaganda , watch your blood pressure and emotions . When you are getting all wrought up , the propaganda is taking hold . That is the time to watch your step . 10 . Most of the news and rumor that you get about world news in the gossip columns is false . It stands to reason that the experienced reporters and news agencies know their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in print or over the air . If the rumors in the gossip columns were true , the regular reporters would get them ; if they were really confidential , they would never see the light of day . 11 . If you have no strong prejudices , preferences , or opinions , try to develop some . If you already know pretty well what you like and dislike , try to organize your likes and dislikes . But above all , read only the news that you find interesting . Do not go out of your way to bore , depress , or bewilder yourself . In short , recognize your own tastes and prejudices , and indulge them .  |
