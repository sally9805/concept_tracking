The old man who shuffled into Manhattan 's Hook &; Ladder Co . No. 3 on Christmas night did not look much like a philanthropist . His shoes were broken , his pants were frayed , he wore only winter underwear under his pea jacket . But the firemen knew him well as a man of good will and charity . <P> Last year James Smith , 73 , porter at the New York Athletic Club at $31.55 a week , had dropped in on Christmas night on the same kind of errand . This year , from a rumpled paper bag , Smith dumped a cascade of dimes , pennies and other small change that added up to more than $300 . Said he : " I 'd like for you to give this to the kids at the New York Foundling Hospital . " <P> Old James Smith , who lives meanly in a $16-a-month room , could stand some medical attention himself : his hernia bothers him a good deal , but he can not afford a doctor ( " Everything is so dear " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , " he explained , " that 's different . I 'm an old bachelor and I do n't have any family , so why should n't I help the poor ? . . . Every night I put aside whatever change I have in my pockets and save it up and when Christmas comes I take it and give it to charity . Why , it 's the least I can do ! " <P> * * * <P> Unless year-end contributions to churches and charities take an unexpected spurt , said Manhattan 's Golden Rule Foundation this week , U.S. giving in 1948 will stand at an alltime low-only 1% of the national income . During the depressed ' 30s , said the foundation ( which bases its reports on income-tax deductions ) , contributions averaged about 5%.
