Eight of Major General James H. Doolittle 's flyers were captured by the Japanese . Fifty-five made their way back to the U.S. and to fighting fronts . Five flew to Russia and were interned there . One was killed , two are missing . Eight stayed in China to fight with Major General Claire Lee Chennault . Last week those eight gathered in the operations room of the Fourteenth Air Force and told their story to TIME Correspondent T. H. White : <P> We got shore leave the night before we left and everybody went out on a last party . It was a beautiful moonlit night , and we could see the carrier in the bay with the planes silhouetted against the sky . <P> We did n't know where we were going , but we had a darn good idea . About a day or two after we left , Doolittle called us all together in the wardroom and told us we were going to hit Tokyo . We just kept going day after day while Naval officers told us about the Jap Navy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the industrial setup , Tokyo fire hazards , water problems , balloon barrages . We just lay around the ship playing poker , shooting craps every night . We had Easter service aboard the ship . It was surprising how many people showed up . <P> All Those Little Ships . The morning of the 18th was a perfect day . We were just getting into Japanese waters . We noticed a little Japanese shipping boat about 7:30 and a cruiser with us sank her right away . We were about 740 miles off the coast of Japan then , but decided to take off right away because all those little ships had radios and we thought they might have warned the Japanese . <P> Right after that we were told to stand by for takeoff . That was 8 o'clock in the morning . Doolittle was off first at 8:20 . <P> The only formation flight was with Doolittle . All the other ships took off singly with specific targets-power plants , ammunition dumps , oil storage , the Mitsubishi aircraft factory , docks , water supply . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tokyo , had to look for the city quite a while . We were 30 feet off the ground . The first thing we saw was a squadron of pursuit ships practicing above us . But they did n't even notice us . Then we passed a training field with lots of planes taking off and landing . We flew right down one side but they did n't pay any attention . <P> We lined up on a power plant with a balloon barrage way off to our left . We got three hits out of four . Doolittle says he saw the stuff go higher than our planes . One fellow says he saw one man going right up in the air sitting on a chair , but that was probably baloney . <P> We were running right along over the streets , just above roofs and could even see a couple of soldiers leaning against a lamppost . Then anti-aircraft got bad with lots of black puffs , so we settled right down on the bay , so low in the water that our props were sucking it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hull . We passed over the whole bay with warships , a weather ship , seven subs there , but nobody fired at us . There were a bunch of people sunning themselves on the beach , they waved to us as we went past .
