txt When Gunner Joseph Edward Hartman of Birmingham , Ala. , regained consciousness after the Japanese Zero had dived into his Flying Fortress and broken it in two , everything was so quiet he wondered what had happened . Where seconds before there had been the roar of four powerful motors , the clatter of machine guns and rush of wind past his cramped tail gun position , now there was nothing , only silence . He was the lone passenger in a piece of what had been an airplane dropping rapidly through an infinity of sky toward the sea and coral-studded island coastline thousands of feet below . It seemed as if he had been falling a long time , but it could not have been more than a few seconds , ne said today as he sat in a Quonset hut batting flies and mosquitoes and telling of his almost incredible trip 17,000 feet down and several hundred miles by dugout canoe and Navy ship from that spot high above the Solomons back to comparative safety at an island base . It was not his destiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane . By some feat of coordination he was able to don a parachute and get away from the falling plane section . He shed heavy clothing as he Mt the sea and swam 1501 yards to shore , where he was found by friendly natives , guided to two white men and later taken in a dugout canoe and small launch to Tulagi . Thence he came here . " I guess I am pretty lucky , " said this likable , well-built youngster who hoped when he joined the Army a month before Pearl Harbor to become a pilot , and still does . The only marks of his experience are a mouse under his left eye and a scar on his head where he was cut getting out of an airplane . Gunner Hartman 's bomber crew was on its twenty-fifth mission since its arrival in this area last October , and when the plane was hit and destroyed by the diving Japanese craft they had already beaten off one attack by enemy fighters . They had gotten two of the first six , he himself shooting down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of his two guns , he related . " An hour later six more found us , " he continued . " We were flying then at /7,000 feet , wearing heavy clothing and oxygen masks . They just kept sitting out there a while and we could n't figure out what they were doing . Then one made a pass at us and the gunner in the upper turret knocked him down . Shortly thereafter , as we passed under a hole in a light cloud layer , another one above us dropped four bombs that missed . It was the first time we knew he was up there . The next thing we knew he was diving straight at us out of the cloud . " " Do you believe he deliberately dove into you ? " Hartman was asked . " I think he did , yes , sir , " he replied . The Japanese pilot came in so fast no one had time to train on him and then there was the shock of collision as the Zero hit the big bomber at about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When I came to , everything was quiet , " he went on , " and I wondered what had happened . I climbed over to the escape hatch to see if I had time to jump . Down below I could see the island getting Ibigger every second . I started putting on the parachute , but because of the heavy clothing I could not get the leg straps fastened . I had fastened it across my chest , though , and decided that would have to do . " The tail of the plane was n't spinning . It was lust going straight down on the side and I crawled tol the small escape hatch and bailed out . " The shock came when the parachute blacked him out again , Hartman said , and he was only a few feet above water when he regained his senses . " I knew I would sink if I did n't get out of that heavy clothing , so I began struggling out of it , " he said . " And when I was about ten feet above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way . " He struck out for shore , where he finally crawled the last few yards through shallow water and stretched out exhausted . Two natives who had seen the plane fall found him there and sheltered him in a small hut through the day  --  this all happened in midmorning  --  and after darkness when he would be hidden from Japanese planes and Japanese patrols on shore , they took him in a dugout canoe to a village some miles away . For a month and a half he lived with these men and then the friendly chief provided a canoe and guard who took him several hundred miles to a half-caste plantation owner who sent him the rest of the way in a motor launch to the safety of the American base on Tulagi . For more than a week while living with the natives he had only the native diet , papia , which is what the natives in this area call paupau , taro root , yams and bananas , and was attired only in a piece of sheet which he wore sarong style . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which they call flying fox and consider a delicacy , but he said he could n't stomach it " although it smelled good . " Gunner Hartman was quite impressed by the village organization , which was ruled by a triumvirate of chief , teacher and constable . Those three decided each night what would be done the next day . The teacher then conveyed the orders to the villages and the constable saw that they were carried out . The women did most of the work , he said , the men only fishing and hunting , and not much of that . " The men certainly took it easy , " he said , grinning . Asked what he would like to do now , Gunner Hartman said he would like to go.home and then get pilot training .
