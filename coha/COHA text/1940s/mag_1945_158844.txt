Corporal John C. Corbett of the 8th Marines had won a signal honor . He picked up a stone and hurled it with all his strength from the low cliffs of southern Okinawa into the blue waters which lapped the shore . That stone 's splash meant that the eleven-week drive by U.S. forces from the center of the island had at last reached the southern tip . <P> The last-ditch Japanese defenders were split into pockets no more than a thousand yards square ; Fleet Admiral Nimitz announced that organized resistance had ended . There was mopping-up still to be done : a few hundred of the enemy held out with machine guns , rifles and grenades . In the final pockets many of the enemy were killed ; some committed hara-kiri with grenades or by jumping off the cliffs ; some surrendered . <P> Credit Side . To the Japanese , the cost of defeat on Okinawa was staggering . <P> <P> They had lost a base within 400 miles of their home islands , only 1,100 miles from Tokyo ; this base would soon be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lost ( by preliminary count ) 98,564 men killed and 4,500 captured . <P> Marine Lieut . General Roy S. Geiger quoted a captured Japanese captain : " The overwhelming equipment and fighting spirit of the Americans are such that any Japanese who thought he had a chance to win this war was just a plain , damned fool . " <P> Debit Side . To the U.S. , the cost of victory on Okinawa was steep , and to some jittery observers it might even seem staggering . But the island had been secured in 82 days , only twelve days more than the time originally estimated for its capture . In overall U.S. casualties it was indeed the bloodiest campaign of the Central and Western Pacific , but in proportion to the harm done the enemy , it was far from being the most costly . At Tarawa , where an estimated 5,000 Japs died or were captured , 1,000 Americans died and 2,000 were wounded-an overall casualty ratio of 5-to-3 . On Saipan the ratio was only 7-to-4 ; Palau , less than 2-to-1 ; on Iwo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans were dead or missing ( 4,417 soldiers , 2,573 marines ) and 29,598 were wounded ( 17,033 soldiers and 12,565 marines ) , the ratio was almost 3-to-1 in favor of the Tenth Army . <P> One unexpected cost of the Okinawa battle had been caused by the Jap suicide planes , which forced the U.S. fleet to stand by and carry on what may well have been the most difficult and expensive air-support operation of the war . Kamikaze planes ( 59 were shot down in two days ) were still attacking ships last week . But even with the Navy 's casualties off Okinawa included with those of the ground forces , the ratio in favor of the conquerors would still be 2-to-1.
