sure with whom you sent it up ; he thought it was probably the executive officer . He fumbled in his pockets . Will you give him my card , sir ? ' Then Mr. LeSueur was shouting again . Card ! Card ! What the hell would he do with a card ! The stupid bastard ca n't even read ! Card ! ' Pauley grabbed Ensign Keith and led him hurriedly off , and when they got to the room they could still hear : Card ! Card ! ' The interviewhad n't gone at all the way it was supposed to . If the way to enter cold water is to dive head-first , then perhaps Ensign Keith 's ungentle immersion into his new life was for the best . Perhaps it had the virtue of numbing him against the shocks to follow . Certainlythere were plenty of them . In the next few days he was buffeted with surprises like a non-stop punching bag . Almost everything he saw and heard , contradicted , refuted , ignored , or scorned one of the impregnableTruths he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pauley , did n't get up at seven o'clock , when an officer should ; he slept until noon . He did n't shave daily as an officer should ; he was growing a shaggy red beard . The officers lounged all day in the sacrosanct wardroom . They kept their hats on in the wardroom , a scandalous violation of naval etiquette . Some of them even sat with their feet on the tables . None of them seemed to do any work . None used the title sir ' in addressingeach other , but other more vigorous and colloquial titles were freely used . Coarse , extra-marital exploits were discussed openly at the dinner-table . Some of the officers drank : Keith was sure he hadp21smelled liquor on Ed Pauley 's breath , and fairly sure he had smelled it on the Doctor . He had heard any number of the officers addressing the enlisted men by their first names , or by nicknames . With his own ears he had heard various officers speak seditiously of the ship and the Navy and , worst of all , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Ensign Pulver , threaten in a convincing voice to commit a piece of shocking mischief against the Captain . And they did n't refer to him as the Captain at all ; they called him Stupid . ' Or worse than that . Young Keith was shocked ; he was shocked . He could scarcely have been more shaken had his own mother gone out and robbed the Kenmore Trust and Savings . In all of his twenty and a half years nothing like this had ever happened . Everything had always come off in good order : the planets had stayed in their orbits ; once a week , before Sunday dinner , his mother had served the family one Martini ; a really well-mannered girl did n't swear ; and people  --  one 's own kind , that is  --  were always nice and considerate and well-bred . Life revolved smoothly about certain fixed and astral values and intangibles ; things like character and family and the Episcopal Church , things whose sanctity it would be insane even to question . And when he joined the Navy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly , these untouchables were not only handled , they were mauled ; they were assaulted continually . When a thing like that happens , when the roots of a man 's faith are torn out and examined , he can do one of two things : he can bind them to himself all the more fiercely , or he can let them go . For a few days Ensign Keith was very quiet , and it was n't clear which course he would take . Then , consciouslyor not , he seemed to make a decision . The first time Keith stood a watch , it became clear which way he would go . It was Dowdy , the boatswain 's mate , who brought this to light . Dowdy was over on the beach one day , ostensibly on ship 's business . Actuallyhe had another purpose . He had heard of a Seabee who would part with beer for a price . This Seabee wanted , and got , two dollars a bottle , and Dowdy bought six bottles which he concealed delicately in the only cardboard box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Dowdy wondered for a while where the hell that box came from and then , on the way back to the ship , he quit thinking about the box and began thinking of the beer . It had been four months since he had had beer , and he thought with almost unbearable affection of his cargo . When he got back aboard , he knew exactly what he would do : he would get a bucket , fill it with ice from the galley , lock himself in the boatswain 's locker and wait for the beer to cool , and then drink it all , every lovely bottle . Maybe he would give one bottle to his friend Olson , the firstclassgunner 's mate . He considered this as he trudged up the gangway . As he stepped aboard , he threw the usual perfunctorysalute to the colors and started aft . He noticed ,  |p23more  or less in passing , the officer-of-the-deck  --  it was that new kid , what was his name ?  --  but he did n't bother saluting . Dowdy was pretty much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respected him or left him alone . He had gotten perhaps ten feet when he heard someone call : Where do you think you 're going ? ' and he turned around and saw this boot ensign standing there , giving him the dirtiest kind of look . Dowdy was all set to put the kid in his place , but before he could say a word , Ensign Keith shot a question that absolutely floored him : How long have you been in the Navy ? ' Well , Dowdy had eleven years in , and to hear this question from the mouth of a brand-new ensign was too much . Dowdy was too flabbergasted to speak . He just stood there and his mouth worked like a fish and no sound came out . When you come aboard you salute the officer-of-thedeck , ' Ensign Keith explained acidly . Now go back and come aboard properly ! ' It was a moment before Dowdy could even move . Then in a kind of idiotic sleepwalk he went back and came aboard properly : he saluted Ensign Keith . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it after this . ' He looked Dowdy up and down coldly . He noticed the box under Dowdy 's arm . What 's that ? ' he asked suspiciously . Dowdy stared stupidly at the box , as though seeing it for the first time . He got his voice back now , but his thinking remained stalled . That 's Kotex , ' he said.  | They use it down in sick-bay . ' It was n't a very likely story . Let me see , ' said Ensign Keith . And Dowdy 's will was so paralyzed that he handed him the priceless box , a thing he never would have done in his right mind . Ensign Keith tore open the box . Then his eyes went wide and his voice got shrill . Beer ! ' he shouted . Beer ! Bringing liquor on board a Navy ship ! Do n't you know that 's a general court-martial offense ? How long have you been in the Navy anyhow ? ' And before Dowdy 's helpless , pleading , agonized eyes he flung the box over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , and he rushed to the rail just in time to witness a scene of incredible waste : six bottles of irreplaceable beer sinking in eight fathoms of water . The sight brought tears to his eyes . For a brief , burning moment of insanity , he thought of strangling Ensign Keith ; but his will for even that pleasurable task was gone before he could act . A broken man , Dowdy stumbled off to the compartment . It would take him hours and maybe days to figure out what had hit him . A boot ensign ! Dowdy felt like crying . Young Keith 's reputation was made right there . From the obscure new ensign ' he was transformed overnight into the best-known officer on the ship . News of the gangway incident spread like a kerosene fire : let alone , it would certainly have attained a fabulous , legendary character ; it was the most startling thing to happen in months . But Ensign Keith did n't let it stand alone ; he added to it . He added to itp25the very next morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to smoke without his permission . He added to it that same afternoon when he put two men on report for appearing on deck without their shirts  --  a foolish requirement of the Captain 's which no one had ever attempted to enforce . Every day and every way he added to it . At sea , standing junior O.O.D. watches , he insisted that the gun crews stay on their feet ; and two more men went on report for sitting on a ready box . Dolan , the second-class quartermaster , talked back to him and made the report list . Steuben , the yeoman , made it by appearing two minutes late to relieve the watch . The report list was no longer an exclusive thing . Twelve cases appeared before Captain 's mast one Saturday , and for ten of them Ensign James L. Keith was the complaining witness . He was hell on wheels . He seemed to be trying , singlehanded , to atone for the laxity of the rest of the ship . In port , on his watch , he required every man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . He banished all reading matter from the gangway desk . He demanded that his messengers stand their watches in immaculate dungarees . He seemed to be trying , singlehanded , to restore the ship to the Navy , from whence it had strayed . One morning in port on the four-to-eight watch he decided that the crew was n't turning out for reveille . He was very right . Chief Johnson made reveille at sixthirtyand at a quarter of seven Ensign Keith went down in the compartment and found it loaded with sleeping bodies . He summoned his most resolute voice and addressedthe bodies : All right ! Get up here ! Get out of those sacks . Every man who 's not out of here in five minutes goes on report ! ' Not a sound . Not a movement . Here and there an eyelid cracked ever so slightly to peer at the intruder ; that was all . Suddenly from the far , after corner of the compartment a clear , unstutteringvoice sounded : Get out of here , you son-of-a-bitch . I 'm warning you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice could have been anyone 's . Ensign Keith jumped . Who said that ? ' he demanded weakly . Silence . Heavy breathing . Not a movement . Ensign Keith repeated his previous threat : I ' 11 be back here in five minutes . Everyone who 's not out goes on report . ' It did n't sound at all convincing . He did n't come back either . A wise man would have profited from that experience , and perhaps it left a mark on young Ensign Keith ; but nothing that was immediately apparent . He went on much as before , only he did n't try to make a personal reveille again . The report list stayed as long as ever . He gave the crew a thoroughly bad time . If he were embarked upon a deliberate program of selfdestruction , he could not have chosen a more likely means to achieve his end . He became the object and the focus and the intention of a quite terrifying pitch of hatred . He had strayed onto an area which few of the officers ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and men constructed painstakingly of mutual tolerance , compromise , and tacit understanding . The officers left the men alone and the men did theAp27same : that way both were free to concentrate upon the Captain . Ensign Keith not only trespassed on that area , he stomped all over it . In a very short time the feeling against him competed favorably with that against the Captain , and it was n't long until the Captain was completelyoutstripped and relegated to the role of secondrateenemy . Considering Ensign Keith , one man , Ludlow , a first division coxswain , was even moved to speak these treasonous words : You know the Old Man ai n't so bad . ' He was hushed up before any real damage could be done , but the fact remained that young Keith put the Captain in a very favorable light . The compartmentat night buzzed with talk of the new ensign , and in the dark corners little sinister groups would gather and plot and threaten and scheme . A quite wise man , Dowdy , listened to this talk and gauged it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he went to his friend , Lieutenant Roberts : Mr. Roberts , ' he said , if he does n't knock it off , that new ensign is going to wake up some day with a marlinspike through his skull . Can you pound some sense in his head ? The boys down there are really getting to feel mean . ' Roberts promised to talk with Ensign Keith . The talk was n't very successful . Roberts found Keith alone in his room and in a very nice , tactful way tried to explain a few things . He was very decent about it . He pointed out that , for such a ship , Keith was being unnecessarily regulation . He pointed out that Keith was making a great many enemies , and that , in a small , interdependent community like this it was n't a good idea to have too many enemies . Then he asked Keith very politely if he did n't think he could ease up just a little . Ensign Keith listened with the respect due his senior officer , then he answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel that I 'm just doing my duty . The regulations which I 'm trying to enforce were made by the fathers of our Navy and they 've lasted a long time . I feel that there must be a reason for them and , as a naval officer , it 's a matter of conscience with me to see that they 're obeyed . After all , ' he finished loftily , a man 's first duty is to his conscience . ' You really could n't argue with such moral superiority , but Roberts did his best . Yes , ' he said , I do n't doubt that they 're excellent regulations on a combatant ship . But on a ship like this they 're just not very practical . On this ship you have to depend on co-operation to a great extent . There 's a good bunch on here , and I think you 'll find that , if you just give them a break , treat them decently , do n't push them around , they 'll do anything you ask . Why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him coldly . I 'm sorry , sir , ' he said , but I do n't believe in fraternization . I believe , ' he said with finality , that familiarity breeds contempt . ' That was the failure of mediation , and Ensign Keith continued on his implacable way . It seemed then that there was no solution short of the marlinspike . His case looked hopeless , and it looked black . The mutterings grew louder and bolder in the dark corners of the compartment . His life expectancy dropped lower andp29lower , and just when it seemed nil , a solution came to pass of such aptness , happiness , and general satisfaction that Ensign Keith was completely forgiven his transgressions and restored in full standing to the communityof good-will , from which he never strayed again . It happened one night at sea . Under way , young Keith stood junior O.O.D. watches under Ed Pauley . The J.O.O.D. was the battery officer and he was also , nominally , the security officer . He was presumed , at least once a watch , to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , peaceful , and reasonably quiet . The other J.O.O.D. 's frequentlyleft the bridge on security patrol , but the only place they ever visited was the wardroom , where they investigated the quality of the coffee . Ensign Keith examined every corner of the ship . On this night he was standing the eight-to-twelve watch with Pauley . It was perhaps ten o'clock when he left the bridge to make the rounds . He went through the compartment , through the galley and the messhall , around past the refrigeration spaces and the storerooms and the offices , down into the ' tween-decks spaces along the starboardside and back again on the port side , past more storerooms and the barber shop and the armory . At the armory he stopped . A crack of light was showing under the door , and inside he could hear voices and a rattling sound . There was a funny smell , too . Ensign Keith pushed the door open . A startled group looked up at him from the deck . Dowdy was there , and Olson , and Dolan , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinist 's mate , and over in the corner by the rifle racks , holding a glass in one hand and with the other trying to force a record onto the turntable of the portable phonograph was Schaffer , another gunner 's mate . The air in the armory was thick with smoke and this other smell . On the deck beside Olson was a large pewter crock from the galley , and the men had glasses beside them . The group on the deck was huddled kneeling before the after bulkhead , and Dowdy had just thrown a pair of dice against the bulkhead . Each man had a pile of bills beside him , and in the middle of the cleared space there were other piles . Ensign Keith shut the door behind him . He looked quickly and accusingly around the room . You men are gambling , ' he announced . No one spoke . No one affirmed or denied the charge . No one moved . Six pairs of sullen , menacing eyes watched Ensign Keith . Do n't you know , ' he demanded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look of craftiness came to Dowdy 's face . Oh , we ai n't gambling , sir , ' he said kindly , as though Keith had made a perfectly natural mistake . We 're just shooting a little crap for fun . It 's not for money . ' Then what 's the money doing out there ? ' Keith asked triumphantly . Dowdy smiled and dismissed it with his hand . Oh , that 's just to keep score with . We figure out that way who has the most points and then at the end of thep31game we give it all back . ' He smiled disarmingly at the officer . It 's the best way I 've found yet to keep score . ' He added righteously , No , sir , we ca n't none of us afford to gamble . We 've found that gambling never pays . ' Ensign Keith stood there , doubt and anger and uncertaintychasing each other across his face . He lifted his cap and replaced it on his head . He pinched his nose . He looked suspiciously around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he smelled the funny smell . What 's that ? ' he demanded . In that jar there ? What are you drinking ? ' Dowdy looked over at the crock . That ? ' he said soothingly . Oh , that 's some fruit juice . That 's some pineapple juice we got from the galley . That 's all that is . Ensign Keith was n't satisfied . Let me see , ' he said to Olson . Olson shot a quick , questioning glance at Dowdy . Dowdy smiled benevolently . Sure , ' he said . Give Mr. Keith a drink of fruit juice . Here 's a glass . ' At any given time there were apt to be brewing on the ship fifteen different batches of jungle juice , but it was agreed that Olson made the most distinctive brand . His jungle juice had character , everyone said . For one thing , through influential connections among the mess cooks , he had access to more ingredients than his competitors . Olson would take an empty ten-gallon water breaker , fill it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange , pineapple , grapefruit , it did n't matter  --  the mess cooks had been able to provide , add sugar , stir well , and stow the breaker in an unlikely corner of number two hold . After a week to ten days of turmoil , the mixture was ready for tapping . It was as unpredictable as a live volcano . In taste , it was as deceptively tranquil as sloe gin , and one or two glasses would creep up on the uninitiated like a wellwieldedhand-billy . The night Biddle , the butcher , ran amuck and tried to kill all the Guinnies ' with a meatcleaver , he had been prodded by several glasses of Olson 's jungle juice . It was ten o'clock when Ensign Keith left the bridge . At eleven , Ed Pauley had occasion to call the flying bridge , and Keith 's absence was reported to him . Pauley was irritated , but more than irritated he was surprised that Keith was doping off : it was n't at all consistent . He sent the messenger around to find Keith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported negatively , he became slightly worried . He considered the vigorous feeling against Keith . He remembered the threats he had heard . He wondered if it was n't just possible that something had happened . He thought about this , and the more he thought , the more plausible it seemed . He sent the messengerout again , and the messenger returned with the same report . Eleven-forty-five and Ensign Mulholland arrived to relieve Keith . Now Pauley was really alarmed . He could visualize Keith swimming far back there in the desolate wake , the sharks following at ap33respectful distance . For a frantic moment he thought of calling the Captain  --  after all , the thing had happenedon his watch  --  and then he controlled himself . He had best be sure first ; he would search the ship himself ; he would look in every goddamn conceivable place . When Lieutenant Carney relieved him , he took Bergstrom , his quartermaster , and set out . Bergstrom carried a flashlight . Pauley fully expected to find Keith down in the bilges with a marlinspike in his back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhausted the likely places ; all the officers ' staterooms , radio room , offices , engineroom , heads . Then they started on the infinite number of unlikely places which , the way Pauley figured it , were really the probable ones . They went through the crew 's compartment and looked in every bunk . They opened storerooms and even opened the refrigerator spaces . They looked in the Chief 's quarters . They looked in the boatswain 's locker . They even looked in the spud locker . Glumly , Pauley led the way through the ' tween-decks spaces on his way to the holds . This was a hell of a thing . If he did n't find him in the holds , he 'd have to call the Old Man . There 'd be hell to pay for this . As he passed the armory , Pauley heard music and voices . He stopped , for the loudest of the voices was clearly Keith 's . Pauley had prepared himself for almost anything , but not for what he found in the armory . Dowdy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Olson had their arms flung about Keith , simultaneously supporting him and leaning on him.  |p34Loudly  and with much stress on certain words the three were singing a thoroughly obscene tune called Violate me in the Violet time in the Vil-est way that you know . ' Within the compass of his two supporters , Keith was flopping his arms about to no discernible rhythm . His eyes were glassy and a huge white grin was pasted on his face . The phonograph beside them was unobtrusivelyplaying a Strauss waltz . Over by the bulkhead Vanessi and Stefanowski teetered on their haunches and peered nearsightedly at the dice on the deck . They argued noisily about what the dice read . In the corner , lying on his back , cradled on two life jackets , Schaffer slept soundly . His mouth was open and a marshmallow was propped in it . There were at least two broken glasses on the deck and the air was fragrant with the smell of jungle juice . Everyone , less Schaffer , greeted Pauley hilariously . When he had recovered a little , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked . Dowdy peered into Keith 's face to find out . He shook him by the shoulder and Keith 's head bobbed back and forth . That ? ' said Dowdy . That 's old Jim Keith . You know old Jim Keith . ' Keith nodded his head solemnly and grinned some more . This is old Jim Keith , ' he echoed . You know old Jim Keith . ' Dowdy winked widely at Pauley . He continued to shake Keith 's shoulder . Yessir , ' he announced , old Jim 's a good son-of-a-bitch . ' Keith nodded heavy approval . Yessir , ' he mumbled.  |p35Old  Jim 's a good son-of-a-bitch . ' Then without a sound , a surprised look on his face , as though the idea had just occurred to him , he slipped easily to the deck , sound asleep . It turned out he was right about being a good son-ofa-bitch . His old rectitude collapsed like a pricked balloon . He never gave the boys trouble again . He took to sleeping until noon and sitting around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . Until the Captain put a stop to it , he wore for a while a tan polo shirt that was screamingly non-regulation . He and his messenger would spend the gangway watches playing checkers on a miniature board , and at sea Keith would sit on a ready box and listen to the stories that fanned from his gun crews . He turned out to be a nice , good-natured kid . As Dowdy said , it just took a little while to get him squared away.  |p36THE  DOCTOR WAS VARIOUSLY DESCRIBED as a crazy littlebastard , a son-of-a-bitch , a good son-of-a-bitch , a hell of a good medico , a quack from the word go , and a nice guy . The area of agreement in all these estimates is that the Doc was contradictory and unpredictable . The Docp37was that . The story went that , on the outside , he had held a lucrative Hollywood practice , but he did n't look the part . Doc was rather a plump little man , balding , in his middle thirties ; and if it is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he most suggestedan outsized , juicy , cherubic mouse  --  with certainqualifications . The qualifications being really contradictionsand most unmouselike , the comparison does n't mean much . The contradictions were the face and the man  --  the satanic little mustache , the wide , unblinking eyes that were simultaneously cruel and compassionate , the shockingly soft voice that never quite concealed the steel beneath . Among the crew he seemed to inspire two antagonistic feelings in equal degree : fear , and a rather boundless admiration . Anyonewho had ever drawn the wrath of his sharp little tongue had good cause to hold the Doc in respect , but on the other hand there were many whose relations with him had been of the friendliest sort imaginable . The pharmacist 's mates , who had cause to feel both ways , swore by him , and would have , even if he did not , as he did , crack a frequent bottle of grain alcohol with them . There was n't really much call for a doctor on the ship and the Doc had little to do . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced calculus problems , readingNietzsche or Schopenhauer , or talking with anyone who chanced in the doorway . Once a day , at eightthirtyin the morning , he held sick call . The attendanceat sick call would vary from time to time , but the complaints  --  the legitimate ones , that is  --  seldom did . For all practical purposes , such as codification , there were only three : constipation , fungus infection , and what the Navy calls cat fever . Once in a while there would be boils needing lancing , a case of appendicitis and maybe even an appendectomy , or simple lacerationssuch as might be produced by a fist , but by and large all complaints fell into the conventional and approveddiagnoses . The attendance was not so uniform , and seemed to be subject to various irrelevant influences . On a holiday routine ( with sleeping-in authorized ) never would more than a handful turn out . But the very next day  --  if the day called for a vigorous program of chipping and scraping decks  --  might see a queue extending all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sick-bay . Any other medical man than the Doc would have been amazed that such a number of cases , and such acute ones , of hangnail , hernia , stomach ulcers , mastoiditis , piles , and strep throat could develop overnight . It had been a long time since anything had amazed the Doc , but every once in a while he had to own himself impressed at the imaginativeness of the sick-call complaints . He was certainly impressed when , on a day the first division was scheduled to paint over the side , Farnsworth , a first division man , announced that he thought he was coming down with Huntington 's chorea , a disease of such rarity as to constitute a medical phenomenon . When Biddle , the butcher , took his meat-cleaver and made realistic attempts to kill all the Guinnies ' on thep39ship , the Doc transferred him to an island hospital with a diagnosis of war neurosis and excellent prospects for a medical survey . At sick-call next morning five new cases made their appearance , and it took the Doc a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly flourished on the ship . There was one time , one sick-call , when the Doc was indisputably amazed . It happened , too , on a morning when he was physiologically not quite equal to amazement . For a week the ship had been anchored in the bay of this rank , weedy , desolate little island , and still there were no prospects of early departure . Quite a palpable depression was beginning to settle on the crew , who agreed to a man that this was the most miserable island of them all , and whose testimony on the subject of miserable islands was irrefutably competent . There was a small Army base ashore , a smaller Naval base , a dirty little native village unmolestedly off by itself , and excessive quantities of mud and dust and jungle and smell : that was all . It was truly the end of the world . Like everyone else , the Doc had fallen prey to the smothering depression that emanated from the place , and the night before he had taken practical remedial measures : he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , governmentspecification grain alcohol , which he shared with Lieutenant Roberts and Ed Pauley . Grain alcohol and orange juice make a pleasing but not very gentle drink , and this morning Doc had an active headache and a tendency to impatience . Attended by Lupich ,  | the first-class pharmacist 's mate , he disposed of the morning 's turnout of hypochondriacs with immoral speed , issuing the blanket prescription of aspirin tablets for all complaints , including athlete 's foot . You need an aspirin , ' was his uniform diagnosis , and twice he added , See , I 'll have one with you . ' Finally there was one man left : Lindstrom , a hulking , grinning seaman who lived up to every inch of the Dumb-Swede tradition . Lindstrom was a farmer boy from South Dakota , had a thatch of yellow hair that could easily have been straw , a hammered-down nose , wing-like ears , maddening good nature , and had once been summarized by Dowdy : When they were passing out brains , that son-of-a-bitch stepped out for a beer . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticedhim moving back to the end of the line , repeatedly giving up his place to late-comers . Now he stood grinningawkwardly and flapping his cap up and down to no apparent purpose . The Doc swiveled around in his chair and looked at him . What 's your trouble ? ' he said coldly . Lindstrom grinned some more , flapped his cap with one hand and scratched his head with the other , and finally said plaintively : I got the clap , Doc . ' The Doc was in no mood for phantasy . Do n't be silly , ' he snapped . Now what 's the matter with you ? ' Lindstrom kept grinning , shook his head doggedly and insisted : I got the clap , Doc . ' The Doc began to get angry . I said do n't be silly ! Where in the hell could you get the clap around here ,  |p41boy  ? ' He was n't expecting any answer at all to that , and certainly not the one Lindstrom gave . Over on the beach , Doc . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native guy , he took me up to his shack . This woman was there and I give her my knife and a pack of Chesterfields . ' He was absorbedly shifting from one foot to the other , as though he had just discovered the gift of movement . She was pretty ugly , ' he added pertinently . The Doc 's eyes were very wide . Come here , ' he said quietly . He made his examination without a word . Then he turned around and stroked his mustache and regarded Lupich . Well , I 'm a son-of-a-gun , ' he said finally , and then , Well , lance me for a tiger . ' He leaned back in the chair , joined his hands behind his head , and delivered a brief speech . Here , ' he said , is a man who , on the most god-forsaken womanless island in the whole goddamn god-forsaken ocean , gets himself a dose of clap . That , I insist , is one for the medical journals . That is comparable to getting sunstroke in Alaska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for the medical journals , furnish documented proof , and I will become famous . ' He eyed Lindstrom . But not half so famous as you , young man . ' Lindstrom considered this speech dubiously . Yessir , ' he said . The Doc kept looking him over while he twisted the waxy villainous tips of his mustache . Well , ' he said genially , you 've got the clap . What do you come to me for ? '  | Lindstrom did n't find the question at all unreasonable . Well , ' he explained obligingly , I thought maybe you could fix it up . ' Fix it up ? ' The Doe 's voice was incredulous . Do you mean cure it ? ' The cold , regarding eyes went wide in consternation . The Swede was visibly unsettled . Yessir , ' he said haltingly , the grin fading from his face . Ca n't you do that , Doc ? ' Why , of course I can do it . The simplest thing in the world ! But you surely do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? ' The cap was Epping now in furious agitation , and on Lindstrom 's face a sudden cloud of bewilderment had settled . Yessir , ' he said apologetically . I 'd kind of like to get rid of it if you could do it , Doc . I 'd sure appreciateit . ' Listen to me , son . ' The Doc leaned forward earnestly and his voice purred with reasonableness . You do n't want to get that cured and I 'll tell you why . ' He tapped the desk . How many men would you say there are out here in the Pacific ? ' he asked softly . Lindstrom knotted his forehead , considering . There 's a pile of them , ' he said finally . Thousands ? ' the Doctor prodded . Would you say there were thousands ? ' Yeah , I guess so . ' A million , perhaps ? Would you say there were a million ? ' Yeah , I guess a million . '  |p43All  right , ' said the Doc . All right . Now there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The grin came back to Lindstrom 's face . There ai n't any , except for this gal over here ' All right , ' the Doc said . All right . There are n't many chances to get the clap , then , are there ? ' Lindstrom did n't guess there were . The clap must be pretty rare , then , among all these men , would you say ? ' Lindstrom guessed it was . How many cases would you say there were ? ' Lindstrom 's brows were pulled down in a deep frown of concentration . He shuffled the floor . Not many , ' he decided . Well , I 'll tell you . ' The Doc spoke with the coy selfgratulationof a man about to bestow a gift . ' I ' 11 tell you . Yours is the only one . You have the only case . Out of the million men in this ocean , you have been chosen . You stand out . ' He beamed almost pridefully at Lindstrom . Now what do you think of that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' he said . Do you see what I mean ? ' the Doc purred on . You are distinctive . You have something a million guys would give their left leg to have . You 're the only one who has it . Now you surely do n't want to lose it , do you ? ' Lindstrom was trying to paw a hole through the deck and apparently so absorbed in the work that he could n't answer.  | Let me put it this way , ' the Doctor went on . If you had been awarded the Congressional Medal , you alone out of a million men , would you give it away ? ' Lindstrom thought this over , and then he asked : What 's the Congressional Medal ? ' That 's the highest military decoration in the land . Would you give that away ? ' The answers were clearly taped out for Lindstrom , but on this one he stepped outside the tapes . I 'd give it to my old lady , ' he said suddenly . He looked to the Doc for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Doc 's lips . The medal you mean , of course , ' he said gently . Well , that would be nice . That would be a nice thought . ' He sat quiet for a moment , as though he had lost the train of his argument . Then he resumed : But to get on with what I was saying , boy . You alone of one million men in this ocean have been blessed with the clap . Now when you go back to the States  --  where are you from , by the way ... ? ' Sir ? Rapid City , South Dakota . ' All right , when you go back to South Dakota , people are going to point you out and say : " The only man in the whole Pacific Ocean to get the clap , and he comes from our town ! Why , I knew him when he was just a little boy ! " You 'll be just as good as a hero . You 'll get your picture in the paper . You 'll talk on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Are you going to throw all that away ? ' Lindstrom did n't seem to follow the argument . He said , Sir ? '  |p45Do  you want me to cure you ? ' the Doc paraphrased . Do you want to throw away your achievement , your medal , your distinction ? Do you want to be clap-less like all the million other men out here ? ' He painted a metaphor : Do you want to be just another member of a mob scene or do you want to stand out ? Which is it ? ' Somehow  --  Lindstrom was n't sure just how  --  the Doctor had conveyed in his talk the delicate threat that if his advice was disregarded it would be rank ingratitude ; it would hurt the Doc . Lindstrom felt this and scratched his mop of hair and sought the softest words possible . Well , sir , ' he said finally , I sure appreciatewhat you say and there 's a lot in what you say , but all the same if you think it 's okay I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Lupich . He wants to get cured . ' He shrugged . All right , ' he said . But be sure you know what you 're saying . Do n't do anything now that you 're going to regret later . Maybe it would be a good idea if you slept on this thing and came back tomorrow with your decision . What do you think ? ' Lindstrom saw that the suggestion was a good one and he considered it . He scratched some more . Then he said : No , sir , thanks all the same , but I do n't figure I 'll change my mind . I kind of think I 'd like to get straightened out now . ' The Doc shrugged again in final defeat . All right , ' he said sadly . You 're the doctor . ' He turned to Lupich . Sulfathiazole :  | When he left sick-bay that morning , Lindstrom was a quite disturbed and unhappy young man . For one thing , he knew that he had hurt the Doc . For another , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . The Doc had sown doubt in his mind , and Lindstrom did n't quite have the equipment to put it out . He went and sat on a bitt on the fo'c'sle for a long time , reviewing the Doe 's arguments and his own convictions , weighing them against each other . The more he thought about it , the more certain Lindstrom became that he had done the right thing . Just to be absolutely sure he decided to get Dowdy 's opinion on it . Dowdy was his boss , the divisional leading petty officer , and Lindstrom , and better minds than Lindstrom 's , considered him infallible . He found Dowdy down in the boatswain 's locker , splicing a section of wire cable . He told Dowdy the whole story , including the Doctor 's arguments , and Dowdy did n't even look up from his work . As he talked on , it became more and more obvious to Lindstrom that he had done the right thing . He finished on a note of scornful superiority . And you know what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted me to keep it like a medal , he said . Hell , he 's crazy , ai n't he ? Did you ever hear anything so crazy ? ' And Lindstrom laughed and slapped his knee and looked to Dowdy for confirmation . He came to the wrong man . Without interrupting the delicate work , Dowdy said evenly : No , he 's not crazy . He 's absolutely right . You 're the one that'sp47crazy . You 've got holes in your head if you get rid of the only dose of clap in the whole damn Pacific . ' Lindstrom was really unhappy then . It took him two full days of steady , torturous ratiocination to reconvincehimself that he had made the right decision And even then , whenever he saw Dowdy , he would feel stirring the pangs of doubt.  |p48IT  SEEMED TO LIEUTENANT ROBERTS that he had justfallen asleep when the flashlight shone in his face , awakening him for the watch . He had been dreaming and in his dream his dead mother was there ; it was summer at his home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sitting on the porch drinking a Coca-Cola , and as he went out she said : On your way back pick up some pastry for supper . ' And he got into the car and started off , and at the corner he smashed right into another car ; and when the driver of the other car came toward him , he saw that it was Captain Morton . The flashlight shone questioningly in his face and he was fully awake by the time the messenger called : Mr. Roberts ! Mr. Roberts ! It 's eleven-thirty , sir . You have the watch . ' Roberts put a hand to his eyes and rubbed them . Okay , ' he said . Thank you . ' The messenger went out , stumbling in the darkened stateroom against the chair . Carefully , he pulled the door to behind him ; he knew that Mr. Roberts would get up ; you only had to call Mr. Roberts once . Roberts lay on his back not movinga muscle , numbly , tiredness an actual ache in his legs , considering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  another four of the hours that wheeled past ceaselessly like ducks in a shooting gallery  --  he must get up and stand in the darkness . Here we go again , he thought ; and as he lay there he felt the old incipient despair that for two hours he had eluded returning again . To stop it he stopped his mind ; he had learned well how to do that . He lay there and all he was doing was breathing and listening . In the hot , pitch-dark little room there were four distinct sounds . There was the noisy breathing of Langston in the bunk above him  --  a long wheezing inspiration , then a pause , then a wet , angry snort . There was the hissing vaguely . He slouched off into the charthouse to write his log and turn in . Roberts had the watch . For maybe the thousandth time in two and a half years he had the watch . He stood alone on the wing and considered this fact . For a moment he thought of figuring just how many watches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He pinched his eyes in an old nervous mannerism and got ready . This would be a long watch , the mid-watch always was ; and besides , there was nothing doing , which made it worse . He might as well get the watch organized , get that over with . He looked into the gyro repeater and checked the course with the helmsman . He checked the gyro with the standard and steering compasses . He asked the talker if everyone had been relieved on the guns : they had been . He had the talker ask Radar if there was anythingaround : there was n't . That squared away the watch . Now there was nothing to do , nothing at all to do but stay on the course , and a moron could do that . He walked back to the wing , leaned against the windshield , and looked out at the sea and the night ; and for the first time he noticed what an incredible night it was . The moon  --  what an enormous moon ! It had risen yellow and round and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrunk a little , but still it was round and full , and no longer yellow , but molten , incandescent silver . The light it spread was daylight with the harshnessfiltered out , unbelievably pure and even and dimensionless . On the bridge you could have read a newspaper : it was that bright . The moon now was onp53the port quarter and all the way to the horizon it parted the water in a wide , white glistening path that hurt the eyes ; and back where the horizon should be there was really none at all , there was only this pale blue , shimmering haze where sky and water merged without a discernible break . And the sea was even more remarkable : Roberts had never seen the sea quite like this . There was n't a ripple anywhere ; there was only the faintest hint of a ground swell , an occasional bulge of water . The surface , glazed as it was with moonlight , looked heavy , coated , enameled : it was that perfect . The ship slid through the water with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a casual knife . At the stern , the wake was a wide , frothing rent , but farther back it was healing and not so wide , and far , far back the fabric was whole and perfect again . Holy Christ , thought Roberts , this sea is a phony , a mirage , an illusion . There could n't be a sea like this . It 's a lie , a myth , a legend . It 's not real . And a not-at-all faint , interior voice answered him : Do n't you wish it were n't ? Yes , said Roberts , I do for a fact : I wish it were n't . And then he added : But this ship ca n't be real . There could n't possibly be a ship like this . The voice concurred : You 're right there . There could n't be . But there is , Roberts said . But there is , the voice agreed . Like a damn mill pond , ' said a voice at his side ; a more plausible and more corporeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quartermaster.  | The smoothest I ever saw it , ' Roberts said . It really is . ' Dolan looked about , almost squinting in the shiny moonlight . What a hell of a night to be out in this place ! ' I was thinking the same thing . ' Dolan , his eyes still scanning the water , shook his head . Man , that beats me . ' He was young , only twenty-one or so , but he was a smart one ; savvy ; shrewd . He had been aboard not quite a year , and in that time he had established himself as one of the most formidablecrapshooters on the ship . From his first day aboard , he had stood watches with Roberts , and a nice feeling had grown up between the two . When they stood a watch there was n't any nicely shaded **31;1420;TOOLONG : there was n't even any awarenessof difference . They just stood and talked together : two men with the mutual background of the United States , the bond of this ship , a mutual dislike of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories and reminisced : things two men together are apt to do anywhere . Their watches were really one continued conversation which they could resume at any time with no consciousness of a break . Crap game tonight ? ' Roberts asked . Yeah , ' Dolan said . I played till about eleven , then I quit . ' How 'd you make out ? ' Horseshit . That 's why I quit . I could n't hit a lick . I went in with a hundred and I dropped that and then I borrowed fifty from Vanessi and I came back a little ,  |p55but  then I dropped that too . So I figured it was time to get out of there . ' Who won all the money ? ' Vanessi . Dowdy and him . That guy Vanessi was up about eight hundred bucks when I got out . He was hotter than a firecracker . ' Dolan was quiet a moment , then he said suddenly : By the way , did you hear about Dowdy ? Him and the Old Man ? ' No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an obviously choice morsel to present . That son-of-a-bitch , you know what he did ? Tonight ? The Old Man called him up , something about the boats , and when they got through the Old Man started crying the blues to Dowdy about the officers on here ; what a miserable bunch of officers there was , and what a miserable outfit the Navy is , and how he wished he was back in the merchant service and could get hold of some of the officers back there . And then he says to Dowdy : " I know the officers on here hate my guts . That 's all right ; I do n't care about that . Now tell me what the crew thinks of me . " And Dowdy looks at him and says , " You really want to know , Captain ? " And then he says : " Okay , you asked me and I 'm telling you . Captain , they think you 're a prick . " " Hooray for Dowdy ! ' Roberts said . He clapped the pelorus . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Captain , they think you 're a prick . " And he said the old man turned blue in the face , he was so mad ; and at first he could n't even talk , he was that mad . Then he told Dowdy to get the hell out of his cabin ! ' Say , that 's wonderful ! ' Roberts said admiringly . I 'm going to see to it that Dowdy gets recommended for the Navy Cross . ' The two worked on the Dowdy incident until its possibilitieswere exhausted ; then they moved on to other matters . Dolan did most of the talking : he was a garrulousyoung man with impressively complete information on all strata of shipboard life , which he passed on faithfully to Mr. Roberts . Roberts , in turn , supplied opinion when asked , advice when asked , and a certain amount of information on officers ' doings , which were somewhat inaccessible to Dolan 's probing . Like all good gossip sessions , theirs was a reciprocal affair , and like a good session it served its purpose ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another story of the Captain to offer , but , following on the perfect finality of the Dowdy incident , these sounded dull and anti-climactic . Then Dolan held forth for some time on the quality of the latest batch of jungle juice that Olson had brewed . Dolan 's argument was that the beverage would be improved by sticking to straight raisin mash and omitting such miscellaneous and accidental fruit juices as could be stolen from the issue room . Roberts conceded he might be right . Then Dolan asked Roberts 's opinion of the chances of getting sent back to the States with a fungus infection of the ear . This , in turn , led to a discussion of various ways of getting a medical survey which lastedp57for quite a while . When there was a lull in the talk , Dolan looked at his watch . Jeez , a quarter of two , ' he said . Okay if I go down for some coffee ? ' Roberts said it was , although it always took Dolan half an hour to get a cup of coffee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting down the ladder . Roberts shook his head . Alone on the wing again , he took his glasses and studied the horizon . There was nothing there ; there was nothing at all in the night but this ship , the point of reference in infinity , and this sea that planed away in all directions to the curving line of its visible limits . A little wind had come up , and on the sea there was a little swell ; the ship rolled in it ever so gently and slowly . Roberts watched as the foremast wheeled in a stately arc against the stars of the Southern Cross , a pointer tracing on the blackboard of the sky . A quarter of two : well , that was good ; that was better than he expected . That 's where it paid to have someone to talk to , someone like Dolan ; the time went down so much more easily . A quarter of two . Two hours down , two to go . It was when you were alone like this , nothing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went hard . It was a hundred times better to run in convoy and be busy as hell ; a station to keep , the zigzag plan to run , ships to watch out for . It was when you were alone like this , no ships and no Dolan to engage the front of your mind , that it got bad . You started thinking then , and that was always bad . Never think : that was one of the two great lessons Roberts had learned . The other was ,  |p58once  started , how to stop thinking . When his mind started to work in the all-too-frequent pattern  --  subjectively , wishfully , unrealistically or too realistically and , in the end , despairingly  --  there was only one thing to do and that was to stop it ; to wipe his mind blank as a slate washed with a sponge , and to keep it that way . He had learned to do that , and he considered the knowledge a priceless boon . He could stand for hours as he did now , his mind shuttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would never quite close completelyengrossed with such an external as the mast pirouetting among the stars , or the phosphorous that flared in the bow wave . And sooner or later the watches always ended  --  he had learned that too  --  they always ended . There were footsteps on the ladder and Dolan was back . He busied himself for a moment in the wheelhouse , getting the two-o'clock readings ; then he came out . He was eating an apple and he handed one to the officer . Clocks go back an hour tomorrow night , ' Dolan said between bites . Not on our watch , though . ' Midnight ? ' Roberts said . I guess so . Christ , they 'd better . I think we 've caught all the long watches so far . And then , when we go the other way and the clocks go ahead , we miss all of those . That 's a bunch of crap ! ' Dolan worked his apple down to the core and threw it over the side . What time does Frisco keep ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think plus seven . Why ? ' Plus seven , ' Dolan mused , plus seven . We 're in minus eleven now . That 's six hours ' difference . ' He ticked off on his fingers . Man , do you know what time it is in Frisco right now ? It 's eight o'clock ! ' That 's right , ' said Roberts . Eight o'clock yesterday . ' Son-of-a-bitch ! ' Dolan was impressed . Think of that , Mr. Roberts . Eight o'clock . Just the time to be starting out in Frisco ! ' Roberts did n't say anything and the quartermaster went on : Man , how I 'd like to be down on Turck Street right now . Just going into the old Yardarm . Things would just be starting to pop down there ! Were you ever in the Yardarm , Mr. Roberts ? ' Roberts smiled . Once . ' I knew it ! ' Dolan said . I might have known you 'd get down there . It 's all right , ai n't it , the old Yardarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More beasts down there than you can shake a stick at ! ' Dolan was getting enthusiastic in his recollection . You know what , Mr. Roberts ? The last time I was there , that was a year ago , man , I found a fine little beast . Cutest little doll you ever saw , blonde , a beautifulfigure , really a beautiful girl . I was pretty stupid drunk , but I saw her and I started dancing with her and she started rubbing it up and boy , I sobered up in a hurry . I said , " Let 's go someplace else , baby , " and she said , " Let 's go , " and we went out the door and I said , " Where we going ? " and she said , " Come with me . " And we got in her car and she drove me right out to her apartment way out by U.C. Hospital . She had an apartment all to herself and this fine car , and , man , I was shacked up with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she was always getting me liquor and I was driving all over town in that Plymouth convertibleand all the time shacked up with that fine beast . That was all right ! ' Dolan shook his head wonderingly . He was all wound up now . He went on and on , recalling other conquests in San Francisco . Roberts listened for a while , but gradually his mind wandered . He nodded his head at the right places , and smiled at the right places , but he was no longer listening . Against his will , knowing he should n't be doing it , he was thinking of San Francisco ; he was back there himself now , reconstructinghis own version of the town . He was thinking of eight o'clock , the hour when the evening came to life ; drawing upon his intensely maintained recollectionsof two and a half years ago . He was thinking of the signs lighting up along Geary Street , and the lineup waiting for taxis in front of the Saint Francis , and the cable cars climbing Nob Hill , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bay and from the city below . Eight o'clock in the nice bars  --  the Saint Francis and the Cirque Room at the Fairmont and the Top of the Mark and the Zebra Room at the Huntington  --  the air bright and murmurous with the laughter and the clink of glasses and the foolish , confidential talk ; and over it all , soft and unheard and really astonishingly sad , the deep , slow rhythms of American dance music.  |p61And  the girls , the fine , straight , clean-limbed American girls in their tailored suits , sitting , leaning forward , each talking with her escort , one hand extended on the table and just touching his sleeve . Or dancing tall and proud to the music that promised them bright and lovely and imperishable things . And at the bar all the young officers , the bright-eyed , expectant young officers , watching the girls , looking for something  --  they did n't know what  --  something that called at night with the dusk and the neon lights and swore to them that tonight , this very night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of desperate loveliness would happen if only they found the right girl , found the right bar , drank enough liquor , smoked enough cigarettes , heard enough talk , laughed enough . But they must hurry , they must hurry !  --  the bars were closing , the ships were sailing , youth itself was running out . What was it they were seeking ? It was n't just a girl , although a girl was necessary . A girl was n't the total ; she was just a factor . It was more than that , Roberts thought  --  what was it ? And the angry , critical , voice inside him answered : Why , you goddamn knucklehead ' Who 're you trying to kid ? The bars are so goddamn noisy you ca n't yell from one table to the next . The women are a bunch of beasts with dirty bare legs and stringy hair . The boys are out for just one thing and that 's to get laid . Who 're you trying to kid , anyway ? Dolan was asking him something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever getting back to the States ? '  |p62Roberts  said mildly . You know better than that . ' Yeah , ' Dolan said , I guess so . But the engineers keep saying we 've got to get in a yard pretty soon . ' And they 've been saying that ever since I 've been aboard . There 's nothing wrong with these engines that ca n't be taken care of right out here . ' Dolan shook his head sadly . Yeah , this bucket will be running around here till the war 's over . ' He added determinedly : But this kid is sure as hell going to get back before then . As soon as I get eighteen months in , if they do n't send me back then , whiz over the hill I go ! ' Roberts turned and smiled . What are you going to do , swim ? ' If necessary ! ' Dolan said emphatically . If necessary ! Do you know there are thousands of bastards lying around the States who 've never been to sea ? Yeoman and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' That does n't help us any . ' No , but it should , ' Dolan said . How long you been out of the States , Mr. Roberts ? ' How long ? Oh , two and a half years . Thirty-three months exactly . ' Jesus Christ ! ' Dolan said , impressed . That 's a long time ! How come ? ' Roberts pinched his ear thoughtfully . I have a theory that all my records have blown out the window at the Bureau . ' But thirty-three months ! That 's a long time ! ' Yes , Roberts thought , it probably was a long time . He was n't sure just how long , but it must have beenp63quite long . He thought of his little sister for a greater comprehension of thirty-three months than the calendarprovided . Thirty-three months had been long enough for his little sister , four years younger , to meet a man , fall in love with him , marry him , and bear a child for him . It was long enough for his sister who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the evidence of the camera , no longer slim , no longer pretty , and more than thirty-three months older . It had been long enough , he wondered , for how many couples to fall in love and marry and have children , for how many pretty girls to lose their looks ? If all the couples who had met and married within that period were to march four abreast past a given point , how long would the procession take ? A hell of a long time , he decided ; probably another two and a half years . I know one thing , ' Dolan was saying , when I do get back I 'm sure as hell going to get married . Little girl in Lakeland , Florida . Cute as hell . Did I ever show you her picture ? ' Roberts shook his head and Dolan said : I got it right here . ' He pulled a wallet out of his dungaree pants and in the ample moonlight they stood and examined the likeness of a round-eyed , gentle-looking girl with bobbed blond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to marry that gal , ' Dolan said . And then when I get out , I 'm going to settle down right there in Lakeland and raise ferns . Make a million dollars growingferns , '  |p64Ferns  ? ' Hell , yeah . There 's a lot of money in them . People just do n't realize . You can make a lot of money growing ferns if you get a little good ground . ' I did n't know , ' Roberts said politely . Yeah , hell , yes , ' Dolan said . What are you going to do when you get out ? ' Roberts picked up a pair of glasses and raised them to his eyes . I have n't the faintest idea . Run a chain of whore-houses , maybe . Grow ferns . Sell apples . Any-thing . ' What were you doing before you came in ? ' Roberts looked through the glasses a moment withoutanswering ; then he put them down . I was going to school , ' he said . Medical school . I 'd just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come they got you in this outfit ? ' I came in . It was my own idea . ' Yeah , but how come ? The draft could n't get you in medical school , could it ? ' ' No . ' And you still joined this outfit ? ' Dolan insisted . When you did n't have to ? ' Roberts smiled a crooked smile . That was right after Pearl Harbor . For some reason I felt I had to get in the war . ' He shrugged as though to dismiss the subject . I do n't understand it myself now . ' Dolan was not to be put aside . Jesus , ' he said . I should n't think you would . If I had a chance like that to stay out , I sure as hell would n't be here now ! '  |p65Jesus  , ' he said again ; and after a moment : How many times a day do you kick yourself , Mr. Roberts ? ' Several hundred , ' Roberts said quietly . An average of several hundred . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out ? ' Roberts shook his head and squinted up at the foremast . Too old , ' he said . I was twenty-two when I came in , I 'm twenty-six now , I 'll be twenty-eight when I get out . That 's too old . I 'd have to take a year of refresherwork , then three more years of med school , then two years interning . That would make me thirty-four before I even started practicing . That 's too much . ' The quartermaster was quiet a moment . Jesus , ' he said after a moment , softly , why in the hell did you want to get in the war ? ' Roberts 's answer was n't really an answer at all . I did n't know then that there were such things as auxiliaries , ' he mused . I just took for granted that I 'd get on a can or a wagon or a carrier right in the middle of it . Instead I end up on a tanker in the Atlantic and this thing out here . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head doubtfullyand looked at his wrist . Three o'clock , ' he announced , five after . ' He went into the wheelhouse to get the readings . He came back and leaned on the pelorus and the two stood together and looked out at the sea . A minute passed , and another , and then the watch collapsed , fell apart , was finished , done with . One minute it was three o'clock , and the next it was four . One minute Dolan was telling a story about the girl friend of Dowdy 's who got her picture in True Detective for shooting her husband , and the next it was three-thirty and time to call the reliefs . And from threethirty , with no interval at all , the clock jumped to a quarter of four and Dolan was making an informal salute and spieling all in one breath and almost in one word , I 've been relieved sir Garrity has the watch , ' and there was Ed Pauley standing beside him , rubbing his eyes and yawning . A hell of a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the watch was over . It is that , Ed , ' Roberts said quietly . It is that . ' Pauley scowled around the horizon . What 's the dope ? ' Two-five-eight . Seventy-two turns . No coursechanges . No zigzag . Stupid has a call in for six . ' Pauley nodded . I saw that . Okay , ' he said . I got it . ' Okay , ' said Roberts . He turned to go . Say , ' called Pauley . Have you got God 's Little Acre ? ' No , I do n't have it . Keith had it the last time I saw it . ' He 's too young to be reading that , ' Pauley pronouncedsoberly . That 's true . ' Roberts went on into the charthouse and wrote his log . When he had finished , he sat for a moment slumped on the stool at the chart-table , rubbing his eyes . He considered going down to the wardroomfor something to eat , then he remembered there was nothing there . He got up slowly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed : it could have been secondsp67that he had been gone . Langston was still breathing with the same rhythm and the same intensity . With the same whine the fan was pushing the same air across the room . The clock ticked on and on . Roberts undressedin the dark and got into bed . He lay on his back , his arms cradled beneath his head , his eyes open and staring into the darkness . Helplessly , before he could stop himself , he thought again of San Francisco . Now , as he saw it , it was midnight there and the bars were letting out ; the couples walked arm in arm down the streets and the women laughed , and all of them were rich with the knowledge of some incomparable party to follow . A boy and a lovely , slender girl with shining black hair came out of the Mark and stepped into a taxicab , and as the taxi pulled away the girl lay back in the seat and turned to the boy with a slow , happy , secret smile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past the careless , oblivious couples , a young man walked alone ; back to the ship , the camp , the empty hotel room ; another night spent of the dwindling supply , and nothing bought . What was he looking for ? What was he missing ? What had he lost ? And then the sudden , angry voice clamored : Will you knock it off ? Will you for Christ 's sake knock it off ? Abruptly as turning out a light Roberts stopped thinking , shut off his mind , composed himself for sleep . Mechanically , through the tiny corner left open , he calculated the day ahead : four hours of sleep now , the four to eight watch in the afternoon , and then all night in  --  no watch until eight the next morning . A whole night in  --  that was something to look forward to.  |p68TO  A SUPERFICIAL OBSERVER , it might seem that there was a minimum of high , clear purpose to Ensign Pulver 's life . A very close observer , scrutinizing Pulver under the lens , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sometimes dubious , one thingp69was abundantly certain  --  that he would travel it in considerablecontentment . Ensign Pulver was a quite happy and relaxed young man . He slept a great deal and very well , ate practically anything without complaint ; and to any stimuli his reaction was apt to be remarkably amiable . He could and did absorb staggeringamounts of well-intentioned insult , and his vanity appeared to be vulnerable on only one point : his feet . By accepted human standards , Ensign Pulver 's feet were enormous , and he was delicate about them . He was apt to become abruptly dignified and not a little aloof when they were offered for discussion . They were offered frequently . Ensign Pulver was a young man of a high degree of ingenuity . Most of this he directed toward his own well-being . Since foresight is the better part of ingenuity , he had reported aboard the ship burdened with a large and heavy wooden box . It would be fatuous to presume that this chest contained clothing . The three cases of beer , six quarts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and two of Vermouth , had lasted , through admirable providence , almost six months , even though shared with Lieutenant Roberts and Ed Pauley and the Doc . Pulver had himself , over the objections of the other three , imposed the pace and the restraint . He had a predilection for certain things effete and sensuous , and he got a wonderful feeling of luxury from lying in his bunk sipping a beer or a Manhattan . Young Pulver got to spending a lot of time in his bunk , asleep and awake . On an average day he prob/ably spent eighteen hours in bed . He was an engineeringofficer . Although few of the officers had anything , really , to do , Pulver had less than most . It would be neither unfair nor very inaccurate to say that , professionally , he did n't do a thing . So he had a lot of time on his hands , and this , with his native ingenuity , he converted to time on his back . His bunk became to him a sort of shrine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was seldom out of it . It was an unusually well-equipped bunk . At the foot Pulver had rigged a small fan which wafted cool breezes over him on the hottestnights . At the side was attached a coffee-can ash tray , a container for cigarettes and another for a lighter . Pulver liked to smoke in bed while he was reading . Books were stowed in the space between the springs and the bulkhead . Beer was kept there , too , and it was possible to open a bottle on the reading light on the bulkhead . He read a great deal , being embarked upon an ambitiousprogram of self-improvement . By education Pulver was a metallurgical engineer , and now read books that he had widely and willingly evaded during his college days . He read these books because they were the books that Lieutenant Roberts read ; consciouslyor not , Ensign Pulver had set out to make himselfover in Roberts 's image . With regard to most objects , people , ideas , Pulver was languidly cynical ; with a few he was languidly approving , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Roberts was utterly unabashed . He thought that Robertswas the greatest guy he had ever known . Hep71prodded him with questions on every conceivable subject , memorized the answers , then went back to his bunk and assiduously absorbed them into his own conversation . He watched the careless , easy dignity with which Roberts met the crew , and studied the way that Roberts got the crew to work for him ; and then he tried to apply this dignity and this control to his own small authority . Being honest with himself , he could n't notice any increased devotion in the eyes of the men ; or indeed , anything more than the usual tolerance . It is not very likely that Ensign Pulver would ever have read Santayana , or the English philosophers , or Jean Christophe , or The Magic Mountain , if he had not seen Roberts reading them . Before this self-imposed apprenticeship , he had been content to stay within the **25;1453;TOOLONG of God 's Little Acre . He had read God 's Little Acre twelve times , and there were certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't leave much time for anything else , but what leisure could be managed he devoted to planning characteristically ingenious actions against the Captain . He did n't really have cause for hard feeling against the Captain , because , being an engineer , he was quite remote from him . In truth , the Captain hardly knew Pulver was aboard . But because Roberts hated the Captain , Pulver felt duty-bound to do the same ; and scarcely a day went by that he did n't present to Roberts the completed planning for a new offensive . To be sure , these offensives seldom went beyond the planning stage , because commonly their structure was so satisfying to Ensign Pulver that he felt fulfilled just in regarding it . Also he was not a very brave young man , and these things called for bravery just as surely as the battlefield . Once he figured out a way to plug , far clown in the sanitary system , the line that fed the Captain 's head , so that the Captain would one day be deluged by a considerablebackwash . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Rube Goldberg device that would punch the Captain in the face with a gloved fist when he entered his cabin . He never did anything about this either . Then he was going to introduce marbles into the overhead in the Captain 's bedroom , the marbles to roll around at night and make an awful racket . He conferredfrequently with the Doctor on ways of transmittinga gonococcus infection to the Captain . About the only plan he ever executed was one involving no personal risk . He did , one day while the Captain was ashore , actually insert shavings from an electric razor into his bed , on the theory that they would serve as satisfactorily as any good itch powder . If they did , the evidences were disappointing , for although Pulver watched closely , the Captain never appeared betterrested , and indeed , better-natured , than in the succeedingdays . One day , during a lull in his reading schedule , a wonderfulidea for the Captain came to Pulver . It was one so stunning that he was able to recognize it immediately as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him gradually , as did most of his schemes , but instead it camep73with the sudden , inevitable force of predestination . It was , quite simply , tremendous : he would get some good substantial firecrackers and throw them into the Old Man 's room at night . It was a wonderful idea , and yet it was so simple , so indicated , and so necessary , that Pulver marveled he had n't thought of it before . The bastard would be walking on his heels for weeks afterward ! What a splendid idea ! Ensign Pulver dedicated several full minutes to self-gratulation . After the first flush of creation , he permitted himself a little to be invaded by realism . He owned no firecrackers , he was sure there were none on the ship , and it was likely that the closest supply was at Honolulu , distant about two thousand miles . But such second-rate obstacles were no match for a thing predestined , and he easily surmounted them . Fireworks , he decided strongly , could be manufactured on the ship . Black powder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make some kind of a fuse too . The idea was a natural  --  it could n't possibly fail . When the plan was complete and glowing in his mind , he took it , as he took all of his plans , to LieutenantRoberts . This was quite late at night and Robertshad turned in . He was n't very enthusiastic when he was awakened to hear the new plan : in fact , he was definitely hostile , if not to the plan , then at least to Pulver . He cursed Pulver vigorously . Then he turned over and went back to sleep . Ensign Pulver was a little hurt at this reception , but it did n't diminish his faith in the plan one whit . He lay in his bunk that night and stayed awake an excessively long time , fifteen minutes or so , savoring the whole thing . The more he thought about it , the better it seemed . He went over in his mind just how it would be . He debated deliciously whether to attach a long time-fuse to the explosive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , throw it , and run like hell . He finally decided in favor of the short fuse as being the more exciting . He fell happily asleep , mesmerized by a vision of Captain Morton , pop-eyed with terror , quaking at the explosions that rocked his very sanity . Next morning he was up at the unprecedented hour of nine . He went right to work . He found some good stout twine to use as a fuse . For a container he cut into firecracker lengths the cardboard roll of a clotheshanger . He went down to sick-bay and begged some potassium sulphate to saturate the fuse . Then he was ready for the explosive . Ensign Pulver was a competent metallurgist , but his knowledge of explosives was deficient . He had , in the course of the night , abandoned black powder as his choice and substituted fulminate of mercury . He knew that by repute fulminate of mercury was terrific stuff , and he reasoned that the best was none too good for this job . He went down to Olson , the gunner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old model five-inch bag ammunition . The primers contained fulminate of mercury . He was ready then for the test . In a state of high excitementhe hurried down to the machine shop just aft of the engine room . The place was well chosen for itsp75subterranean location , large cleared area , and corrugatedsteel deck . Ensign Pulver cut open the primers , sealed one end of a section of the cardboard tubing , filled the case with fulminate of mercury , inserted the potassium sulphate fuse and plugged the other end around it . He stood back then and viewed the product with an artist 's pride . It bulged ominously and did not much resemble a firecracker . Ensign Pulver hummed and smiled happily as he found a match and lit the one-inch fuse . He had made two miscalculations . They were fairly grave . He had underestimated the rate at which the potassium sulphate fuse would burn . It went like a streak . And he had grossly underestimated and completelymisunderstood the explosive character of fulminateof mercury , which , particle for particle , is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signalmen , way up on the flying bridge , claimed that they could feel the explosion ; and certainly every man on the ship heard it . The men in the engine room were terrified ; they knew that finally a torpedo had struck . If the Captain had been aboard , he would almost certainly have been screaming , Prepare to abandon ship ! ' It was quite a firecracker . The Doc said that Ensign Pulver got off very light . His eyebrows and lashes were burned off , and the hair for an area of two inches back from his forehead . He received first-degree burns of the face , neck , and forearms . He was in sick-bay for a day soaking in tannic acid . After that he was up and around , but with his head and throat swathed like a mummy . Perhaps he was a proper object for sympathy , but his appearance short-circuited any that might have been forthcoming . He looked pretty silly without eyebrows and with his nose sticking out from the bandages like a beacon . Just as a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did pretty well , too , sometimesgoing two and three weeks without even seeing him . Now , however , just a few days after his accident , rounding a corner in the boat-deck passageway , he ian smack into Captain Morton . The Captain had n't seen or heard of Pulver 's condition , and his response was typically childlike . For a moment he gaped and goggled , and then he started chuckling . He had a particularlylewd and rasping chuckle , and he stood pointing at the turbaned Pulver and laughing like a child confronted by a clown . What the hell 'd you do ? ' he demanded . Stick your head in one of them goddam furnaces down there ? ' And he chuckled the more at his own wit . Ensign Pulver forced a grin , said Yessir , ' and started edging toward the down ladder . The Captain looked at him benevolently . Goddamn , boy , ' he chortled , you want to keep your head out of those furnaces . Do n't you know that ? ' Pulver made another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he saw a chance only moderately rude , he ducked down the ladder . He was so furious he could n't see straight . The goddamned smart-aleck , loud-mouthed son-of-a-bitch ! He tried very hard top77keep his anger focused on the Captain , but all the time he knew better . What really rubbed , he knew , was his conviction of the considerable justice in the Captain 's laughter.  |p78LIEUTENANT  CARNEY , the first division officer , and Lieutenant ( jg ) Billings , the communicator , had a fight one day . It was n't a fight , really  --  more of a spat than anything else  --  but even so aborted a difference between the two was an event of genuineness . Until thisp79particular day they had roomed together for fifteen months without so much as a sharp word . While the other officers fretted and cursed and complained , Carney and Billings had made a separate peace with each other and with the ship . While the other officers prowled the ship and plotted against the Captain and wore themselves out seeking diversion , these two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get up now or wait half an hour until noon . Carney and Billings had reduced life in stateroom number nine to the ultimate simplicity , and were working constantly to push it beyond that point . All the needs of man were right there : the room owned a private head and twenty steps down the passageway was the wardroom with its food and coffee Silex and acey-deucey board . What more could a man want ? Billings had n't been out of the amidships house in two months , since the time he got lost looking for the paint locker . They lived a little idyll in stateroom number nine . Billings , who stood no watches , slept every day until noon , but one day out of four Carney had to get up at eight . The process of arising at noon and greeting the not-very-new day was always the same : Billings , who occupied the top bunk , would dangle an arm or a leg over the side ; Carney would command fiercely , Get back in there where you belong ' ; Billings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and Carney would finish off , And stay there ! ' This happened three days out of four , and every day  --  sometimes two and three times a day  --  another little ritual would be acted out . One would say to the other : Feel like getting your ass whipped ? ' ; to which the reply was : Think you 're man enough ? ' : and the reply to that was : Yes , I think so . ' Then the two would march to the wardroom , for this was the invitation to acey-deucey combat . These sequences were the fixed points of the day , the cliches , the rituals , and like all rituals they were performedautomatically , unconsciously , and without awareness of repetition . The plan for the rest of the day was fixed too , but it allowed some small room for improvisation . There were at least two ways in which the afternoon could be spent . Carney was from Osceola , Iowa , where he operated his father 's shoe store ; Billings was from Minnesota , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thoughtful talk , Carney picturing for Billings the romance of the shoe business , Billings pointing out the grievously neglectedfascination of animal husbandry . Other happy afternoons would be devoted to what might be called ( if the word did not imply the contrasting present of a gainful occupation ) avocations . Carney painted in water colors . He started out on landscapes : he painted a simple pastoral scene , animals grazing in a field , but perspective gave him unexpected trouble , and the cows seemed to be suspended in air over the pigs . He decidedhe was n't ready for landscapes . Next he did from a photograph a portrait of his wife , but it was unfortunatetoo . One eye was larger than the other and focused in another direction , the nose was crooked and the mouth was pulled up as though with paralysis.  |p81Carney  decided he was n't ready for portraits either , and painted from life a red and yellow-striped thermos bottle which was more successful . Billings 's hobby was socialism . He had acquired it unexpectedly by reading Upton Sinclair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the essays of Bertrand Russell . He had placed himself on the mailing list of twelve Socialist organs and three Communist , and these of an afternoon he would read aloud to Carney at his painting . Billings tried earnestly to bring Carney to his persuasion , but , although Carney always listened politely , it was clear that he would not become a convert during Billings 's lifetime . In the room , though , they lived a quite definite communal life . When the laundry was late , Carney wore Billings 's scivvies , and Billings Carney 's shirts . Whichever toothpastehappened to be out was the one used . Books had no ownership at all . Through an unuttered agreement Billings supplied cigarettes and soap for the room , while Carney provided Coca-Cola , which he had bought from a merchant ship . Everything in stateroom nine was organized like that ; every problem that life could throw up was absorbed , smothered , controlled . Carney and Billings had made an approach to Nirvana equaled by few in our time . It was strange , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the ship was unloading again at Apathy island . It was a wretched place , flat and rank and bilious green ; bad enough to look at and worse to smell . Great fat swollen flies with a sting like a bee's swarmed out from the island and infested the ship . Long , vicious mosquitoes came out too . Eight- and tenfootsharks patrolled the ship to prevent swimming . There was n't a thing over on the beach ; not an officers ' club , not even a single bottle of beer . And hot !  --  all day long the sun pounded down through the breathless air , and all day the porous jungle absorbed and stored the heat . And then at night , when the sun had set and the cool time should begin , the jungle exhaled in a foul , steaming breath the day 's accumulation of heated air . It was a maddening place ; everyone got on the nerves of everyone else ; there were five fist-fights while the ship was there . Still , you had a right to expect Carney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarrel began in the morning and gathered momentumthrough the day . It began when it became too hot even to sleep , when both Carney and Billings awoke at the unheard-of hour of nine . For a while they lay in their bunks and did n't move and did n't talk . From the top bunk Billings could look out the porthole and see the glaring water and the seedy island . Carney could n't see them from the bottom bunk , but he knew they were there . Then Billings dangled a foot over the edge of the bunk . Get back in there , ' Carney said listlessly , out of old habit . Billings 's answer was unexpected and startling : Cut it out , ' he said sharply . For a moment , after it was said , it was very quiet in there . Neither said any more and after a little Billings sat up and crawled down from his bunk . He was sweating and he plodded to the head to take a shower.  |p83Ile  came out cursing : the water was off : it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his shoes and started dressing . He could n't find his shirt right away . Where 's my goddamn shirt ? ' he grumbled , more to himself than to Carney . It did n't require an answer , but Carney , smarting under Billings 's testiness of a few minutes back , gave him one . How the hell should I know ? ' he snapped . If Billings had said something then , if perhaps they had exchanged a few words , they might have removed the whole matter from their chests . But Billings turned his back and did n't say a word . He went down to the wardroom for a cup of coffee and he was sore . He was sore and simmering when he went into the wardroom , but when there was no coffee on the Silex he flared into anger . That son-of-a-bitch , he thought : and curiously enough he was n't designating the steward 's mate who had neglected the coffee , he was thinking of Carney . Within the next half-hour a combination of several things set his nasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie was a dreary , stupid musical which had already been shown once on the ship and which he had seen in the States three years ago . That took the last bit of hope from the day right there . Then the Captain called him up and ate his ass out for the way the signalmen were keeping the flying bridge . After that Billings sat down and broke a message which ordered the ship , upon completingdischarge , right back to the place it had left , a place almost as sorry as this . And , finally , he learned that the unloading was going very slowly , so slowly that they would n't be out of here for a week anyway . Everyonehad counted on getting out in four days at the most . That did it , the last piece of news did it . A little later Billings went down to the room . Carney was up now , sitting at the desk in his shorts writing a letter . His clothes were thrown across Billings 's bunk . Billings exploded : Get your goddamn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the bottom bunk . Carney did n't look up from his letter . Screw you , you silly bastard , ' he said coldly . Right through the nose , ' Billings replied and went out . The thing was declared then ; it was out in the open . From then on , it mounted steadily . Noon chow , consisting of a New England boiled dinner despised by all , eaten in collaboration with a hundred arrogant flies , did n't help matters . After lunch Carney got into the room first and into the shower first . That was at twelvethirty ; the water went off promptly at one . Billings wanted very much to take a shower . He sat around the room quite obviously waiting to do so . At one minute to one Carney , singing happily , stepped out of the shower . You 're pretty goddamn smart , are n't you ? ' Billings snarled . I think so , ' said Carney blandly . Jesus ! ' Billings said disgustedly . He stalked out and the heat of his anger climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cheap son-of-a-bitch ! ' As the after/noon wore on , he thought furiously and obsessionally of his roommate , and the more he thought , the angrier he got . And , curiously , the angrier he got , the thirstier he got . By three o'clock he craved a drink , specifically a Coca-Cola , more than anything in the world . Every afternoon at three he and Carney would drink a CocaColacooled with ice from the wardroom refrigerator . It had become an addiction for both , and Billings had to have his now . It was , of course , out of the question to ask that son-of-a-bitch Carney for one , so Billings decided to steal it . But when he went down to the room to accomplish this , Carney was there , sitting at the desk , approximately the size of life . He was painting what seemed to be a native outrigger canoe , and on the desk beside him was a frosty glass of Coca-Cola . Billings went out without a word . Craftily he went to the wardroom and seated himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't long until Carney came out and went down the passageway . It was n't long then until Billings streaked for the room . The cokes , he well knew , were at the bottom of Carney 's closet . He was delighted with himself , exhilaratingly revenged , elated , until he tried the closet door . It was locked . To Billings 's credit , it must be said that he took this in stride . He did the only thing possible under the circumstances . He collected all of the cigarettes , all the matches , all the soap , even tiny slivers from the trays , and locked them in his drawer . It was n't enough , but it was the only thing he could do . He went out and when it was time to wash up for evening chow , he returned to the room . Carney was still there . Without a word Billings unlocked his drawer , took out the soap and washed himself . Then he locked up the soap again . Carney watched , smiling superiorly . My , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think so , ' said Billings . He knew that Carney was burned up . That was the penultimate round . The climax came after the movie . The picture turned out poor as everyoneknew , and some of the crew did n't even wait for the finish . Billings and the amiable Ensign Pulver left early and were sitting talking in stateroom nine when Carney came in . Pulver , who was ignorant of the day 's tension , greeted Carney cheerily : Hi , Louie , ' he said . Sit down and let 's have one of your cokes . ' Carney replied with a geniality that sharply excluded Billings . Frank , ' he said , I think that 's a fine idea . Let 's you and I have one . ' Pulver thought it was some kind of game . Ai n't you going to give old Alfy here one ? ' he said thoughtlessly . Carney snorted . Hell , no ! Let the son-of-a-bitch buy his own ! ' Billings said immediately : Who the hell wants your cokes , you silly bastard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You do . You 'd give your left leg for a coke right now . ' The hell I would . ' Billings turned to Pulver , who was sitting very much surprised at this sharp and sincere exchange . He had never known the two to talk likep87this . Jesus , ' said Billings scornfully , did you ever hear such a petty son-of-a-bitch ? He 's got his cokes locked up in that closet ! Afraid somebody 's going to get one of them ! ' I 'm not afraid you 're going to get any , ' Carney sneered . That 's for sure . ' Billings continued to address the bewildered Pulver . That is the cheapest son-of-a-bitch I ever knew . You could count on your fingers all the money he 's spent since he 's been on this ship . Mooch !  --  all the bastard does is mooch . He has n't bought a cigarette since he 's been on here . He 's the penny-pinchingest , moochingestbastard I ever knew ! ' Would n't you like a coke ? ' Carney taunted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jesus , what an ass ! ' Billings was saying . What a petty no-good bastard ! Sits on his ass all day and does these stupid paintings . Have you ever seen any of his paintings ?  --  a five-year-old moron could do better ! ' Carney could n't keep the anger out of his voice now . Look who 's talking ! The sack-king himself ! That sonof-a-bitchspends so much time in there he gets sores on his back . Actually ! ' He turned to Billings . Why do n't you get up in your sack where you belong ? ' he sneered . Why do n't you put me there ? ' I think that 's a good ideal ' I 'd like to see it ! ' It was a bad moment . Both roommates were on their feet ready to swing . Ensign Pulver , normally a rather ineffective young man , suddenly arose to greatness . He got between them and he made it a joke . Boys , boys , boys , ' he soothed . Take it easy or Stupid 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the chair and then he got Billings to sit down again on the bunk . For a moment they sat glowering at each other . Then Carney picked up the quarrel . Talk about petty , ' he said to Pulver . Do you know what that guy did today ? Actually did ? He locked up little tiny slivers of soap so I could n't use them ! So small you could hardly see them , and he locked them up ! ' Carney shook his head . Boy , that beats me . ' Nothing beats you , ' Billings shot back , when it comes to pettiness . You 're the world 's champ ! ' And not only that , ' Carney went on to Pulver , but the other day he was up banging ears with the Old Man again . He tells us he hates him and every chance he gets he sneaks up there and bangs ears . That 's a nice guy to have around ! ' You wish you could get up there yourself , do n't you , you son-of-a-bitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch your language , ' he said tightly . Why should I ? ' Billings challenged . Can you tell me why ? ' Pulver stepped into the breach again . All right , goddamit , ' he said sternly . Knock it off . It 's too hot for such crap . Now knock it off , both of you . ' Pulver probablysurprised himself , but he was certainly effective . Billings stood up and stretched elaborately . Yeah , ' he said , you 're right , Frank . It 's getting boring in here , Let 's you and I get out . '  |p89That  's a fine idea , ' said Carney . Not you , Frank , ' he added . Billings ignored this . Yeah , let 's go visit our friends , ' he said . The company 's getting stupid in here . ' He threw an arm around Pulver and led him toward the door . Yeah , go visit your friends , ' Carney sneered . Billings has so many of them . ' Billings nodded knowingly to Pulver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doorway , obviously glad enough of an excuse to get out . I 'll see you later , Louie , ' he said impartially to Carney . Then he and Billings went out . That was all , then ; the thing was over . Billings sat for three hours with Pulver in the wardroom playing acey-deucey , and he lost . every game but two . OrdinarilyPulver could n't take a game from him , but tonightBillings was so gorged with anger that he could n't see straight . His mind was n't on the game , his mind was trying to figure some way to get at Carney , but he could n't think of a thing . Finally at midnight they quit . Billings went in to go to bed . The room was dark , and Carney was already in bed . So , in the process of undressing , Billings turned all the lights on and slammed the door to the head as loudly as he could . Then he climbed into his bunk . He was just about asleep when all the lights flashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was Carney retaliating . That night it rained , and all night long it rained . Next morning it was still raining , a chill , shifting , con/tinuous tropical rain . Both Carney and Billings awoke at eight , felt the rain , pulled a sheet about them , and went snugly back to sleep . At eleven , in co-ordination , they awoke again , and both felt fine . A lovely cool breeze was coming in the porthole , and outside the rain was smoking on the water , so dense that Billings , looking out , could n't even see the hated island . He yawned , stretched happily , and carelessly dropped an arm over the side of the bunk . Before he remembered and caught himself , Carney almost told him to get back in there . After a while Billings got up and dressed . Jesus , ' he said , rain : He said it with just the right impersonalinflection , that did n't necessarily invite a reply . Yeah , ' said Carney . He said it just right , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . That was all the conversation until noon . All the officers were in good spirits at lunch . The rain made them feel good , and besides , there was the news that an extra stevedore gang was being assigned the ship , which meant they 'd be out of here in four days after all . Not only that , but there was a good movie  --  Rita Hayworth  --  scheduled for tonight , and it was only six months old . Billings felt so good that he went up to the radio shack and did some work . As he worked , his glow of general and diffused mellowness concentrated itself into a beam of good feeling directed at Carney . He thought what a good roommate Carney was . He thought over the events of the previous day and how foolish , really , the quarrel had been . He resolved to go down and start patching things up.  |p91In  the room Carney was painting at the desk again . Billings went over to the washbasin and scrubbed his hands and scrupulously examined his teeth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informatively , casually , and as though it had just occurred to him : Oh , say , the exec was looking for you . ' Carney looked up and said politely : Yeah , thanks , I saw him . ' Billings went back to the shack then and finished his work . He felt that they were ready now for a full reconciliation . It was about three o'clock , Coca-Cola time , when he returned to the room . He stood peering attentively over Carney 's shoulder . The work in progress was that of a red stone building of an architecture possible only for a courthouse or a schoolhouse , set in the center of a public square . The square had a lawn of bluish tint , and there were several improbable-looking trees scattered about . Atop the building was what was evidently intended for a cupola , but with its upcurved corners looked more like a pagoda . Where is that ? ' Billings asked respectfully . Carney looked up and smiled . That 's Osceola , ' he said . The courthouse at Osceola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued to study the picture seriously . What 's that ? ' he said , pointing to the pagoda-like structure . That 's the cupola , ' Carney said . He cocked his head at the picture and grinned . Those curves represent the Chinese influence on my work . '  | Billings stroked his chin and with a perfectly deadpanface he asked : Are you sure they do n't represent the Asiatic influence ? ' And then both of them were laughing easily together , and Carney , still laughing , was waving his hand and saying carelessly : Get the ice . ' Over the cokes , they sat back and examined the work critically . I think it 's my best work , ' Carney said . What do you think ? ' I think it is , ' Billings agreed . He turned his head this way and that . You 're getting good on sidewalks , ' he noted . Yeah , ' said Carney . I 'm good on sidewalks . Those are pretty good trees , too , do n't you think ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They finished the cokes and Carney leaned back in his chair and yawned and stretched . Well , ' he said . I 've done enough work for today . I think I 'll knock off . ' Billings yawned and stretched , too . He scratched his head . Very casually he said : Feel like getting your ass whipped ? ' Carney cocked an eyebrow at him . Think you 're man enough ? ' I think so , ' Billings said . Okay . ' They stood up and Carney led the way to the wardroom.  |p93THE  ANCHORING ITSELF was accomplished without incident . The anchor chain banged and rattled in the hawse pipes and the ship shuddered as it stampeded out . The word , Secure the special sea detail , ' was blatted over the P.A. system and five seconds later the engine room called the bridge for permission to secure the main engines . The Captain made the appropriate reply , Goddamit , they 'll secure when I get good and ready to let them secure , ' but he did it without enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those bastards down there who sit on their tails waiting to secure . It was a very hot , sweaty day , about three in the afternoon , and it seemed just another island : so nobody 's heart beat very much faster at beinganchored . The port routine commenced , a matter of loosening the ship 's belt a notch or two . The gun watches stayed on , but the lookouts were secured and ran below to find the crap game . A boat was lowered to go over and get the mail . Back on number four hatch the canvas screen was rigged for the night 's movie . Stuyzuiski , a seaman in the third division who would n't get out of his clothes under way , took a bath ; and at chow everyone remarked on how much better he smelled . Ensign Pulver mixed himself what he called a Manhattan  --  a third of a water-glass of brandy , a splash of vermouth , and a couple of ice cubes  --  and lay in his bunk and sipped it admiringly . The crew leaned on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the naval base ashore . Becker , a seaman received on board in the last draft , was moved to remark to Dowdy : This ai n't a bad place , you know it ? ' Dowdy said something obscene without even turning his head . Becker bumbled on : No , I mean it ai n't as bad as most of the places we been to . It 's kind of pretty . '  |p95Becker  was right , though ; it was kind of pretty ; it was really a rather lovely little bay . The water off the reef was terribly blue , a showy light-ink blue . The bay was enclosed by a chain of islands , and instead of the usual flat barren coral these were green with lush and heavy foliage , and on two sides of the anchorage they ran up to impressive hills that were remote and purplingin the late afternoon sun . And the channel at the end of the bay wound away into the deep shadow between the islands and reappeared flashing in the secret and smoky distance . The crew , lined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being here ; and even Dowdy was probably aware that , aesthetically , this was quite a superior place . Its intrinsic and most spectacular virtue fell to Sam Insigna to discover . ( Although if Sam had n't found it one of the other signalman would have soon enough . ) Sam was a little monkey of a man , not quite five feet tall , long-armed and bow-legged like a monkey , with a monkey 's grinning , wizened face , who had achieved considerable fame aboard the ship by once attacking , unprovoked and with the intention of doing physical violence , a six-foot-four-inch marine . Sam was up on the flying bridge with the other signalmen and he was idly scanning the beach through the ship 's telescope , a large , mounted glass of thirty-two power . The ship was anchored perhaps two hundred yards from the beach , and just off the starboard bow , the way she was headingnow , there was a base hospital . The hospital flag was flying over three rows of Quonset huts ; there wasp96well-trimmed grass between the huts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Farther off to the right was the rest of the naval base ; clapboard buildings and Quonsets scattered between coconut palms , and down at the waterfront there was a long wooden dock where a Liberty ship was unloading . Dead ahead , right on the point , was the interesting thing , though , the really amazing thing . It was a house , easily identifiable as a house ; an authentic civilian house . It was a wooden , two-story house , painted yellow ; long and low , with a veranda running the entire length . There was a swing on the veranda and several cane chairs , there was a fine green lawn running down to the beach , and there were two green wooden benches on the lawn under the trees . It was an old house , obviouslylong antedating American occupation of the island ; it was a formless , bleak , and even ugly house ; yet , in these surroundings , in the middle of the Pacific , it seemed to the signalmen a thing of great magnificence . It must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung the telescope around to have a look at this . At first he trained it carelessly around the grounds , then he turned it on the house . For perhaps a full minute nothing happened , and then it did . Sam had been leaning with one elbow on the windshield ; all of a sudden he jerked upright , sucked in his breath and grabbed at the glass as if he were falling . The idea flashed through the mind of Schlemmer , standing beside him , that Sam had been hit by a sniper.  |p97Holy  Christ ! ' Sam said . He seemed to have difficulty in speaking . What is it ? ' Schlemmer said , and he grabbed for a long-glass . There was only reverence in Sam 's voice . Holy Christ ! She 's bare-assed ! ' One of the many anomalies of our ponderous Navy is its ability to move fast , to strike the swift , telling blow at the precise moment it is needed . There were accessible in the wheelhouse and charthouse seven pairs of binoculars ; on the flying bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's telescope ; and on a platform above was the range-finder , an instrument of powerful magnification . Within a commendably brief time after Sam had sounded the alarm , somewhere betweenfifteen and twenty seconds , there were manned six pairs of binoculars , two spyglasses , two long-glasses , of course the ship 's telescope , and the range-finder . The glasses were all on the target right away , but the rangefindertook a little longer , that instrument being a large unwieldy affair which required considerable frantic cranking and adjusting by two men in order to focus on a target . Through a rather surprising sense of delicacy , considering that two quartermasters and the talker were left without , one pair of binoculars remaineduntouched : the ones clearly labeled Captain . ' In future scrutinies , it was found necessary to press all glasses into service , exempting none . Sam 's discovery was basically simple , natural , reasonable . He had discovered that nurses lived in the long ,  | yellow house . He had discovered two large windows in the middle of the second-story front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , retracted . He had discovered ( the telescope is a powerful glass and the room was well illumined by sunlight ) that the windows belonged to the bathroom . It is , of course , redundant to say that he had also discovered a nurse in the shower stall in the far left-hand corner of the room . All of this would seem to be a model of logic , of sweet reasonableness : what could possibly be more logical than that there be a hospital at this base , that there be nurses attached to this hospital , that these nurses lived in a house , that this house have a bathroom , that this bathroomhave windows , that these nurses bathe ? Nothing , you would think . And yet to these signalmen and quartermasters ( who had last seen a white woman , probably fat , certainly fully clothed , perhaps fourteen months ago ) this vision was literally that , a vision , and a miracle , and not a very small miracle , either . Like Sam , they were stricken with reverence in its presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who could speak at all . Holy Christ ! ' a few of them managed to breathe , and Son-of-a-bitch ! ' That was all . Those are the only legitimate things a man can say when suddenly confronted with the imponderable . The word spread fast , although how it is difficult to say : certainly no one left the bridge . The four-to-eight signal watch , Niesen and Canappa , never known to relieve before the stroke of the hour , appeared at threethirtyand met an equally incredible thing ; a watchp99that refused to be relieved . Get the hell out of here , ' Sam told the newcomers . We 're staying up here till chow . ' There was some bitterness and much indignant insistence by the oncoming pair of their right to relieve the watch , but the old watch , firmly entrenched at the glasses , stayed by them until chow was piped . There was a splendid run of bathers . The shore station blinked for half an hour trying to rouse this ship , a bare two hundred yards away ; and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more alert signal watch . Accordingly , the glass of the striker Mannion was taken away from him and he was detailed to watch for signals . It seemed that Sam had just gone below for supper when he was back again , demanding and getting his telescope . He and the rest of the watch stayed on until after sunset , when lights went on in the bathroom and the curtains were pulled chastely down for the night ; all the way down , leaving not the merest crack . That first day was chaotic , comparable perhaps to the establishing of a beachhead . It was ill-organized ; there was duplication and wasted effort . The next day went much better . A system and a pattern appeared . The curtain was raised at 0745 and was witnessed by Sam , Schlemmer , Canappa , Mannion , Morris , Niesen , three quartermasters , and the officer-of-the-deck . For perhaps forty-five minutes there was a dazzling crowd of early-morning bathers ; almost a surfeit of them , sometimes three or four at a time . Then there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) that extended to ten o'clock . Sam organized for the slack period . It is fatiguing to stand squinting through an eyepiece for long periods , so Sam arranged that one man , by turns , keep the lookout during the off-hours and give the word when action developed . But he refused to let Mannion take a turn . That son-of-a-bitch watched one strip down yesterday and did n't open his mouth , ' he accused . It was possible by this time to establish the routine of the house . After the big early-morning rush there was only an occasional and accidental visitor until around ten , when the night watch would begin to get up . From ten to eleven was fairly good , and eleven until noon was very good . From lunch until two was quiet , but from two until two-forty-five there was the same rich procession as in the morning . After four , things dropped off sharply and were n't really much good again for the rest of the day . It was shrewdly observedand duly noted that watches at the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon . All glasses were manned during those periods ; pathetic little two-power opera glasses made their appearance then , and the windshield and splintershieldsof the flying bridge presented a solid wall of variously magnified eyeballs . By this time , also , the watch  --  as it came to be known  --  assumed a routine of its own . The assignment and ownership of glasses came to be understood . Three pairs of binoculars belonged down below for the officerof-the-deckand two quartermasters . The other four pairs of binoculars , the spy-glasses and the long-glasses , belonged to the signalmen ; to use themselves or lendp101to radiomen , storekeepers , and cooks in return for futurefavors . The range-finder came to be recognized as officer property and was almost continually manned by a rotating team of two officers ; Lieutenant Carney and Ensign Moulton being the most constant . The big telescope , of course , was a prize . It magnified thirtytwotimes . There was a box of Lux soap sitting on a shelf on the far wall of the bathroom , and with the telescope Sam could make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , in smaller letters , the word Thrifty : He could even almost make out the much smaller words in the lower left-hand corner of the box . The long - glass could barely make out the word Thrifty ' and could n't begin to make out the words in the corner . The spy-glasses and the binoculars could n't even make out the word Thrifty . ' From the first , Sam 's right to the telescope had been strangely unchallenged , perhaps in intuitive recognition of his zeal . Turncliffe , the first-class signalman , gave him a brief argument once  --  more of a token argument , really , than anything else  --  and then retired to the long-glass . For quite a while Sam was indisputably on the telescope ; then one morning Lieutenant ( jg ) Billings chanced on the bridge . Lieutenant Billings was the communication officer and Sam 's boss , and he relieved Sam briefly on the telescope . That was all right the first time ; Sam was good-natured in yielding ; he liked Mr. Billings . But then Mr. Billings began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every time he would relieve Sam . Not only that , he had an un- canny talent for arriving at the most propitious moment . Sam got pretty sore over the whole business . As he complained to his friend Schlemmer : Sure , he 's an officer . All right . If we was in a chow line together , sure , he could go in ahead of me . All right . But I sure ca n't see where that gives him the right to take a man 's glass away from him ! ' To Sam , a man 's glass was an inviolable thing . By the third day personalities began to emerge from the amorphous group that flitted past the bathroom windows . Despite the fact that the light was usually bad up around the face , thus eliminating facial identificationsas a method , the boys were able to distinguish one nurse from another with considerable accuracy . There appeared to be nine consistent users of this particularbathroom . Canappa insisted there were only eight , but then he denied the validity of the two-blonde theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported by the consensus . Canappa pointed out that the two had never been seen together ; but this was rather a foolish argument , as both had been examined separately from the same angle , which happened to be a telling one . Canappa , who had not seen both from this angle , stuck to his discredited opinion . Undeniably , there were grounds for confusion . Both girls were young , both were pretty ( although , as mentioned before , facial characteristics were inexact ) , and both wore red-and-white striped bathrobes  --  or maybe even the same bathrobe . That is no doubt what threw Canappa off . Because , actually , there was conclusive evidence ofp103their separate identity ; evidence of the most distinctive sort which one of the girls carried . As Mannion put it , looking up from his glass : What the hell is that she 's got ? ' Sam did n't look up from his glass . You dumb bastard , that 's a birthmark . ' Mannion was convinced , but he was irritated by Sam 's tone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever heard of a birthmark down there ? That 's paint ; she 's gotten into some paint . Or else it 's a burn . That 's what it is  --  it 's a burn ! ' Sam 's rebuttal was simple and unanswerable : Who the hell ever heard of a burn down there ? ' It routed Mannion satisfactorily , and after a moment Sam disclosed : Why , Christ , I had an uncle once who had a birthmark . . . ' He went on to tell where his uncle 's birthmark was situated . He described it in some detail . The two blondes were the real stars : as the result of comparison the other girls came to be regarded as rather run-of-the-mill and were observed with condescensionand even some small degree of indifference . There was one , rather old and quite fat , who absolutely disgusted Schlemmer . Whenever she put in an appearance , he would leave his glass and indignantly exhort the rest of the watch to do the same . Do n't look at her , ' he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry when he was ignored . With the emergence of personalities came the recognition of personal habits . The tall skinny brunette al- ways let the shower water run for several minutes before a bath . The stubby little brunette with the yellow bathrobe always used the bathtub ; would sit in the tub and drink what looked like coffee , but might have been tea . The girl with high , piled-up hair would fuss for an hour extracting hairpins , and then take a shampoo in the washbasin by the window without removing her robe . That 's a stupid goddamn way to take a shampoo , ' Sam commented . But by far the most notable idiosyncrasy belonged to the blonde with the birthmark . It was one which endearedher to all the watchers and drove Morris to rapturouslyannounce : I 'm going to marry that gall ' Like everything about the place it was plausible , normal , and really not at all remarkable . It occurred before every bath and consisted simply of shedding the red-andwhitestriped bathrobe and standing for several minutes ( discreetly withdrawn from the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was a girl who loved beauty , and certainly the view was a fine one . The bay in the afternoon was shiny blue plate glass , really perfect except where the wake of a lazily paddled native canoe flawed the illusion . The tall coconut palms along the beach were as poetically motionless as sculpture . A little way out from the bay was the thin white line of the surf at the reef , and far , far out was the scary , almost indistinguishable line of the horizon . Perhaps the girl 's thoughts , as she stood admiring all that beatitude , ran something like this : What peace ! There is no effort anywhere . See the canoe driftingp105lazily across the bay . Observe the trees with not a leaf stirring , and the ship riding peacefully at anchor , her men justly resting after the arduous days at sea . What utter tranquillity ! ' From there she could not hear the cranking of the range-finder . There was one ghastly afternoon when not a soul , not a single soul , came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , finally , disgusted . Sam probably spoke for all when he said : Christ , and they call themselves nurses ! They 're nothing but a goddamn bunch of filthy pigs . A nurse would at least take a bath once in a while . Jesus , I pity those poor sick bastards over there who have to let those filthy pigs handle them ! ' But that only happened once , and by and large it could not fairly be said that the nurses were disappointing . In fact , Sam himself was once moved to observe : This is too good to last . ' It was one of the most prophetic things Sam ever said . Lieutenant ( jg ) Langston , the gunnery officer , had been having a good bit of trouble with his eyes . He was n't at all satisfied with his glasses . One day he had a splitting headache and the next morning he went over to the base hospital to have his eyes refracted . They were very nice over there . The Doctor was very nice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she also was very nice . It took only about an hour and a half to find just the right lenses , and while he was waiting for his pupils to contract , Langston began talk- ing with the nurse . In a very short time it came out that she was from a town not twenty miles from Youngstown , Ohio , where he lived . Langston felt that a certain bond was established , and on the strength of it he invited the nurse , whose name was Miss Williamson , to dinner on the ship that night . It is well known that shipboard food is several cuts above shore-based food , and this consideration was perhaps a factor in Miss Williamson 's ready acceptance . She did add one clause , though : she asked if she could bring a friend , a terribly cute girl . ' Langston , a personable if rather courtly young man , of course said yes , and mentioned that he would assign her to a friend of his , an Ensign Pulver , whom he described as a very handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girls came aboard that night , escorted by the two officers , the entire crew was massed along the rail and on the bridges . As the white-stockinged legs tripped up the gangway , one great , composite , heartfeltwhistle rose to the heavens and hung there . Ensign Pulver 's girl , Miss Girard , had turned out to be a knockout . At dinner in the wardroom he could scarcely keep his eyes off her , and no more could the other officers , who feigned eating and made self-conscious conversation . Miss Girard had lovely soft blond hair which she wore in bangs , wide blue innocent eyes , and the pertest nose there ever was . The total effect was that of radiant innocence ; innocence triumphant . Only Ensign Pulver noted that when she smiled her eyes screwed up shrewdly and her mouth curved knowingly ;  |p107but  then only Ensign Pulver would . For Langston , it was enough to have what he felt to be the envious admirationof his messmates ; but there began to grow in the mind of Ensign Pulver , himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a greater reward . Once in a while he would catch and hold Miss Girard 's glance , and when he did he thought he detected interest there . After dinner , when the party repaired to his room for further polite conversation , he felt more and more sure of it . There were only two chairs in the room and so he and Miss Girard sat together on the edge of the bottom bunk . That gave a certain intimacy , he thought ; a certain tie of shared experience . He was moved to break out the quart of Old Overholt , four-fifths full , which he had kept hidden for two months in the little recessunder the drawer of his bunk . With Coca-Cola which Langston provided it made a nice drink . Ensign Pulver was then emboldened to tell what he privately called his test story , ' the decisively off-color tale of ze black chapeau . ' Miss Girard 's response was excellent ; she laughed delightedly . Then , craftily aware of the impressivenessof the unfamiliar , he proposed a tour of the ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to shape itself in Pulver 's mind : after the tour , a few more drinks ; then a little dancing in the wardroom ; then a few more drinks ; then get Langstonto take the other one off somewhere . As they started out , Miss Girard gave him her small hand . First they toured the main deck , the offices and the galley and sick bay . Then they dropped down into the cavernous engine room , and Pulver , who was an engineering officer , talked casually of the massive turbinesand terrifying boilers . The girls were very much impressed . From the engine room they went up to the bridge , through the wheelhouse , through the charthouse , through the radio room , and on up to the flying bridge . That was a thoughtless thing for the two officers to do , but fortunately an alert quartermaster had preceded them . The inspection party found the signalmen clustered in an innocent group under the canvas awning , and the telescope trained at an angle of ninety degrees from the yellow house . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they seemed welded to the deck with awe . The two nurses giggled a little , no doubt over the prospect of these men so obviously dumbfounded at seeing a woman that they could only gape . Ensign Pulver later claimed that he felt something ominous in that group , but whether or not he actually did is unimportant . Langston led the party to the forward splintershield , where it could look down the sheer drop to the main deck , and the even more scary distance to the very bottom of number three hatch . The girls were really impressed with that . When they started to walk around behind the funnel , Ensign Pulver noticed that Sam Insigna was trailing them . He was a little annoyed , but , being a young man of poise , he made a sort of introduction . This is Sam , ' he said , one of the signalmen . ' Miss Girard smiled at Sam . How do you do , Sam , '  |p109she  said graciously . Sam was evidently too shy and flustered to speak ; he just stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss Girard squeezed her escort 's hand and whispered , He 's darling ' Pulver nodded dubiously . They took a turn around the funnel , came forward again , and went over to the port wing to look at the twenty-millimeters . By this time the signalmenhad gotten their tongues back and were having a bitter and quite vocal argument under the awning . It was obvious that they were trying to keep their voices guarded , but , as often happens , the restraint only intensifiedthem . Sam 's voice in particular carried well . Goddamit , ' the party heard him say , I 'll bet you one hundred bucks ! ' Lieutenant ( jg ) Langston nodded his head in the direction of the signalmen , smiled superiorly , and said to the nurses : Seems to be an argument . ' Then Sam 's voice came to them again . That voice was several things : it was shrill , it was combative , it was angry ; but most of all it was audible . There have been few more audible voices , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an unfaltering parabola , fell on the ears of the inspection party , and broke into words of simple eloquence . You stupid son-of-a-bitch , I tell you that 's her ! I got one hundred bucks that says that 's the one with the birthmark on her ass ! Now put up or shut up ! ' Sam may have been right , at that . No one ever knew ; no one on the ship ever saw that birthmark again . The curtains of the two middle upstairs windows were not raised next morning , and when the ship sailed three days later they were still down . It was three weeks before a sizable membership of the crew would speak to Sam except to curse him , and it was longer than that before Ensign Pulver would speak to him at all.  |p111ALL  OF THE OFFICERS , excepting the Doctor and Mr. Gonaud , the supply officer , had at one time or another submitted letters to the Bureau requesting a change of duty . This was their privilege , and presumably the Bureau gave just consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their requests perfunctorily and without hope ; for all of them were absolutely certain that there existed at the Bureau a yeoman , probably a Wave , whose sole duty it was to drop all such correspondence , unopened , into a roaring incinerator . As incontestable proof of this theory they cited that in fourteen months the only officer transferred had been an ensign named Soucek , who had been aboard only six months and who had never submitted a letter . Naturally there was some ill-will toward Soucek , who was considered underserving of such spectacular good fortune ; but for the most part the officers accepted the stroke philosophically and even , their theory confirmed , with a certain satisfaction . While the officers may or may not have been right in guessing the disposition of their requests , there can be no doubt at all that they correctly gauged the futility of them . As a matter of policy  --  a policy , clearly , of pure spite ; since he had loudly and many times expressed his desire to be rid of his whole passel of officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Not recommending approval . ' That way they were licked from the start . The other officers were content to submit their one letter , make their one gesture , and let it go at that , but Lieutenant Roberts did not give up so easily . One month to the day after he had written his first request , he appeared in the yeoman 's office and had the letter retyped verbatim and presented again to the Captain . The Captain muttered , then sputtered , then roared : butp113he had no choice other than to forward it ; with , of course , the same negative endorsement . Every month after that  --  without fail , it was exactly a month  --  this procedure was repeated : Lieutenant Roberts would submit the same letter and the Captain with the same curses would apply the same endorsement . It might seem that this was a foolish and futile business and in the main Roberts would agree ; but not entirely . As he explained to his friend Ensign Pulver , he felt it had a certain nuisance value . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read these letters , sooner or later that person was going to get so very angry that he would be transferred to the naval equivalent of Siberia  --  which , by comparison with the Reluctant , he did not consider at all undesirable . And he knew for an agreeablefact that every time the yeoman appeared bearing his letter , the Captain 's digestion was effectively ruined for at least one meal . Roberts submitted these letters so regularly on the fourteenth of each month that once , when he forgot , Steuben , the yeoman , came around and in some alarm reminded him that his letter was due . There was an incident one day with the Captain which served to demonstrate to Roberts that he was wedded to this ship irrevocably and for all time , that there was nothing in the world he could do to release himself , and that his only hope for separation lay in the direct intervention of God . Like most incidents between the officers and the Captain , it occurred while Roberts had the O.O.D. watch in port.  | As with every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ritual for these incidents . The Captain would sit all day in his cabin and through his portholes scan the foredeck . Whenever he saw there something that displeased him  --  a matter of ridiculous ease  --  he would vigorously so inform the officer-of-thedeck . Sometimes he would make these notices the matter of a personal visit to the bridge , and at others he would deliver them by telephone . Allowing for the small variety of occasion , these monologues were remarkablyof a type ; they were invariably profane , unfailinglyshrill , and always they concluded with the threat of ten days in hack for the officer-of-the-deck . Ten days in hack means for an officer ten days ' confinementin his room , and in the Old Navy , the Regular Navy , it was considered a drastic punishment . An officer thus punished was considered to be publicly humiliated , and undoubtedly felt that way himself . This punishment was viewed in a somewhat different light by the Reserve officers of the Reluctant . To say that ten days in hack was considered a reward of almost unbearable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his threat with only one officer , Carney , and Carney had had a wonderful time in his room . He slept happily for most of the ten days , getting up only to eat , to work on his water colors , or to entertain the almost continuous stream of envious officers who visited him . If the Captain had been at all a perceptive man , he would have seen that with these officers his threat was not the proper one.  |p115On  this afternoon Roberts had had a very busy watch . The ship was simultaneously unloading cargo from three holds onto LCM 's and LCT 's , and he had not only the routine of the watch , but also the complex duties of cargo officer to occupy him . He had to see that the boats tied up at the right place , that they were loaded properly , and , since there was need for speed , that the whole operation kept moving . It is a complicatedand highly trying business , moving cargo onto half a dozen landing craft at one time , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of petty interference from the Captain . Normally the Captain had just enough sense to leave Roberts alone  --  except for a little nagging in a routine way to keep up appearances  --  but today he clearly forgot himself . If he had called the bridge once this afternoon , he had called fifteen times , and every time Roberts had to drop what he was doing and listen to the Old Man 's views on some such absurd detail as a man on deck without a cap , or cigarette butts on the flying bridge . Roberts had a fair store of patience , but the Captain was going through it fast . The last time the Captain called Roberts was out on the wing telling three different boats where he wanted them . He refused to talk to the Captain . Tell him I 'm busy ! ' he said to the quartermaster . The quartermaster did that and came back grinning . Flash Redl ' he announced . In the usages of the ship this meant , not that an air attack was imminent , but rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain stormed onto the wing . As always when in extreme anger , his face was beet-red . He shouted at Roberts . What the hell do you mean , telling me you 're busy ? Who the hell do you think you are anyhow ? By God , I 'm running this here ship and when I tell you I want to talk to you , by God , you get on that phone in a goddamn quick hurryl Do you un-derstand ? ' Roberts had been standing in the outboard corner of the wing with a megaphone in his hand . He put the megaphone down very carefully and turned to the Captain . Captain , ' he said easily , there 's no use your coming up here and getting all excited . We 're doing this job as well as we can , and if you just leave us alone and quit bothering , we 'll get along all right : And with that he picked up the megaphone and shouted instructions to an LCT . Bergstrom , the quartermaster , and the messenger and the talker were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They told later how the Captain 's eyes popped almost out of his head , how his mouth fell open , and how for a space of several seconds it worked soundlessly . Then he was shouting again , and shaking his fist at Roberts , and absolutely quivering with rage . Now you 've gone too farl You 've gone too far this time! By God , you ca n't talk to me like that and get away with itl By God , I 'm the Captain of this ship , and no smart son-of-a-bitching college officer is going to talk like thatl I do n't have to put up with crap like that and I do n't intend tol You can go in your room for ten days and see how you like that ! '  |p117Roberts  had slung around his neck a pair of binoculars , which he had been using for spotting the numbers of approaching boats . He faced the Captain now and removed the glasses . Do you relieve me , Captainl ' he said coldly . Can I go down in my room now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you knowl ' The Captain 's mouth worked again , and then he said : Yeah , I know you wouldl You think you 're pretty goddamnsmart , do n't you ? ' Are you relieving me , Captain ? ' Roberts persisted . Are you giving me ten days in hack ? Can I start now , Captain ? ' He extended the glasses to the Captain . Captain Morton had deflated visibly now . A slightly trapped look had come into his face . He did n't look at Roberts and he did n't shout . He looked uneasily out over the water . He ignored the proffered glasses . By God , ' he said defensively and quite inconsistently , I do n't ask a lot from you officers , but when I want a thing done I want it donel Now , by God , you just do your job and do n't go trying to tell me how to run this here ship and we 'll get along all right . But , by God , I 'm not going to take a lot of crap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to slouch away , but Roberts was implacable . How about it , Captain ? ' he demanded . Am I going in my room for ten days or not ? ' The Captain 's face filled with blood again , but still he did n't turn around to Roberts . By God , ' he muttered fiercely , I 'll let you know when I give you ten days and , by God , you 'll know it ! Now you just get to work and take care of your job up here ! ' And the Captain started walking away into the wheelhouse . Roberts stayed right at his heels . Captain , if you do n't like the way I 'm handling my job , why do n't you get me transferred ? You could do it , you know , Cap-tain ! ' Captain Morton was now in complete rout . It was public rout , too , for suddenly there were half a dozen enlisted men in the wheelhouse . He did n't turn even now to make a stand . By God , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to run the ship , ' he mumbledagain , and he kept on walking toward the door . Roberts was as relentless as a Fury . It would be easy , Captain , ' he went on . All you have to do is write a letter and say you want to get rid of me . I 'll even write the letter for you , Captain ! ' he offered . But the Captain , trailing an unintelligible mutter , had ducked quickly through the door and down the ladder . The incident was an instantaneous sensation on the ship . Everyone talked of it , and Roberts 's name was on everyone 's lips . He could not conceivably have been more of a hero . Everywhere he went , hands were thrust into his and he was effusively congratulated . To the crew of the Reluctant , it seemed a splendid victory . But Roberts did n't see it that way . That night Ensign Pulver , sitting talking in his room , said to him : Boy , you really won a round today ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I did n't win . He won , '  |p119How  the hell do you figure ? ' Pulver demanded . Roberts turned up his palms . I 'm still on the ship , ' he pointed out . Then he said wearily : No , Pulver , he won . He wins them all . The Captain 's bound to win , every time . '  |p120THIS  HAPPENED On a very hot day . It was shortly after noon , about one o'clock , and the sick , white-hot sun was slamming down from almost directly overhead . But for a few scattered puffy cirrus clouds the sky was clear , and it was almost colorless . Even at its zenith the sunp121had faded it to pallid blue , and lower down , all the way around the horizon , it was bleached to a dead , dirty white . The sea was n't blue either , but a sudden uniformshine crawling in all directions to the flawed line of the horizon . There was no breeze ; even the ten-knot motion of the ship did n't create any . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of an attic room on a summer day . The deck and all of the metal surfaces of the ship were scalding to the feet and to the touch . Except directly beneath the gun tubs and close against the mast-tables and the house there was no shade . The gun crew of the forward three-inch battery was miserable . Big Gerhart , the gun captain , and Wiley , the third-class gunner 's mate , stood leaning on the pointer 's seat . Red Stevens was standing with his elbows propped on the splintershield looking out to starboard . Reber , wearing the headset , was also propped against the splintershield facing aft . The fifth man , little Porky Payne , was stationed over on the port gun , ostensibly keeping a lookout in that direction . All of them were on their feet because they were right there under the Captain 's eye all the time . For the same reason all of them kept their dungaree shirts on and all of their shirts were sweated soaking wet . That was the hell of being up here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew back aft could sit down in the shade , if there was any , and take off their shirts ; but not up here . Big Gerhart wiped the sweat from his face and flicked it away . Christ ! ' he said . His hair was cropped short and his eyes were small and pig-like in a round ,  | small-featured face . He walked to the forward edge of the gun tub and looked down . Below him a couple of first division men were lying in the shade with their heads cradled on life-jackets . Lady , the terrier-bulldog-spaniel , was flattened on her stomach in a little puddle of shade on the hatch-cover . Her tongue was out and flopping from the side of her mouth as she lay head down , panting . Christ ! ! ' Gerhart said again , and then , To hell with it ! ' He jerked open his shirt , stripped it off and flung it over the pointer 's seat . His fat white back was greasy with sweat . To hell with it , ' he announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shirt on today ! ' Nobody said anything . He stood for a moment leaning over the splintershield . Hey , Whitley , ' he called to one of the men lying below him , pass the dog up here . ' Grumbling , the man picked up the limp little dog and passed her up the ladder to Gerhart . Wiley watched disapprovingly . Why the hell do n't you leave her alone ? ' he said . Gerhart said , Shut up , ' and knelt beside the dog . The dog looked up at him with pleading , infinitely weary eyes . He started talking to her . What do you say , Lady ? How 're you getting along ? ' He prodded her in the ribs . He rolled her over on her back and started slapping her stomach sharply . His lips clenched tightly as he did this . What 's the matter , Lady ? ' he said . What ya lying around like that for ? Did n't you get the word ? " Turn to , " they said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her feet , grasped her twop123front paws and started waltzing her about . That 's the stuff , Lady , ' he said . You got to step lively in this here outfit . Got to get off your ass . ' Wiley said again : For Christ 's sake , leave the dog alone ! Ca n't you see she 's half dead ! ' Gerhart looked up coldly . Why do n't you mind your own business ? ' He turned again to the dog . Eh , Lady , ' he said . He took her then by the hind legs and wheeled her from side to side . She was panting in quick , fierce gasps and saliva ran from her mouth . Yessir , Lady , ' said Gerhart , you 're getting out of shape . Sit around on your ass too much . Got to get off your ass in this outfit . ' Finally he allowed her to lie down on the deck . He took her then by the ears and jerked her head from side to side , first by yanking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whined in pain . Gerhart gave one last tug . Okay , Lady , ' he said , you 're a cry-baby . Go back and lie on your ass . ' He stood up and left the dog lying on the hot deck . Wiley picked her up and stepped down the ladder and put her in the shade of the gun tub . Jesus Christ ! ' he said disgustedly . The gun crew stood in heavy , sodden silence . They hardly moved , seemed hardly to breathe . Once Gerhartslapped at his stomach as a drop of sweat rolled down . There was no let-up to the lidless sun , and the heated air settled with almost palpable weight . The gun crew slumped beneath it . Gerhart and Wiley leaned hard against the pointer 's seat . Red Stevens stood staring bewitched at the water . Reber , the talker , hitched at his binding pants around the crotch ,  | finish up your five years out here , you 'll really be Asiatic ! You 'll really be seeing flying fish then ! ' Wiley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out here no five years , ' he said . He 's got to get back to his wife . ' Gerhart snorted . Get back to his wife , hell ! They got it ten years out here now for married men . ' He stopped and looked at Red . Are you married , Red ? ' he asked with sudden interest . Red started to blush , and Wiley answered for him . Sure he 's married . The cutest little doll you ever saw . Show him her picture , Red , ' he said . Yeah ? ' said Gerhart . You got a picture of her , Red ? ' Sure , ' said Wiley . Show him the picture , Red . ' Very embarrassed , Red got out his wallet and passed it to Gerhart . Gerhart stood and studied the pictures . He let out a long whistle . He smacked his lips . Mmmmmh , ' he said , that 's all right . That 's all right , boy . Where 'd you ever get a gal like that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . Man , that bathing suit gets me ! ' His voice became easy and conversational . How long you been married , Red ? ' Red smiled , About fourteen months . ' Yeah ? ' said Gerhart . You was married about two months before you come out here ? ' Red nodded . Your wife , how old would she be ? About twenty ? ' She 's twenty now . She was nineteen then . ' What 's her name by the way ? ' MISTER ROBERTS 127p127Margie . ' Margie , ' said Gerhart . That 's a nice name . Where did you and Margie go on your honeymoon ? ' Wiley said : All right , Gerhart , do n't go getting started on Red 's wife . ' His voice , though , did n't really protest and he continued to stand by listening with a half-smile . Gerhart ignored him . Where did you and Margie go for the first night you was married ? ' he went on . Red blushed . San Jose , ' he said . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huh ? Well , that 's a nice town . Did you stay at a hotel there ? ' Red nodded and looked down at the water . Gerhart 's voice got confidential . Tell me something , Red , ' he said . I ai n't married myself and I 've alwayswondered . How was it that first night ? Huh ? ' Red blushed deeply . How do you mean ? ' he said . Gerhart prodded him in the ribs and winked . Youknow how I mean . How was it ? ' Red started to say something and then stopped . Okay , ' he said finally . Okay ? ' said Gerhart . Well , that 's fine . Tell me , ' he went on , how many times did you do it that first night , Red ? ' Red did n't look up . I do n't know . ' Oh , sure you know . How many times was it ? ' I do n't remember . ' You do n't remember ? Jesus , a pretty girl like that , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . He was absorbedly peeling paint off the outside of the splintershield . Say , tell me something , ' Gerhart said smoothly . Was your wife a virgin when you was married ? I mean I 'm just an old country boy and I want to find out about these things , so when I get married . ' Red looked up quickly at Big Gerhart . Then he looked puzzledly over to Wiley . He started a smile and then stopped . Naturally , ' he said . Hey , ' said Wiley , for Christ 's sake knock it off . That 's none of your damn business . ' Shut up , ' said Gerhart . He turned again to Red . So Margie was a virgin . Well , I 'm glad to hear that . So many girls ai n't these days , you know . ' He rubbed his chin thoughtfully . How did Margie like it that first night ? ' Red 's blush by now had turned to a deep , solid flush . I do n't know , ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gerhart coaxed . What did she do  --  did she just lie there and whimper ? ' I do n't know , ' Red said . He kept looking out at the horizon . Gerhart took on an offended tone . Aw , Red , ' he said , you ai n't any help at all . How am I going to know what to do when I get married if you ai n't going to tell me things ? You , an old married man like you are . ' Red gave a twisted smile and shook his head . Gerhart went on : This is something they tell me is important , Red : were you able to keep her satisfied ? A young , pretty girl like that ? '  |p129Red  looked up quickly . He gave a strained little laugh . That 's none of your business , ' he said unconvincingly . Oh , sure it is , ' Gerhart soothed . I want to find out about these things . I 'm just an old country boy . Come on , Red , cut me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , Red , ' said Wiley . He 's gettingtoo damn nosey . ' But Wiley kept smiling . Gerhart did n't pay any attention . He continued softly : You know what they tell me , Red ? They tell me that once a woman has had a little , she just ca n't get enough after that . Is that true ? ' Red did n't answer . Yessir , ' said Gerhart . That 's what they tell me . How long did you say you 'd been out here ? Eleven months ? ' Red said nothing . Okay , say eleven months . Now your wife Margie , she looks like a nice , normal healthy girl . She got the same desires the rest of us got  --  hell , Red , there 's nothing wrong with that . You know , Red , ' he finished , eleven months is a long time . ' Gerhart wiped the sweat from his face with a large flat hand and then he said : Tell me honestly , Red  --  now tell me the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you all the time you 're out here ? Things being like they are ? Now do you honestly ? ' Red had a startled look . He looked quickly at Gerhartand then over at Wiley , standing beside him , and then his eyes darted around the gun tub . He licked his lips quickly and he did n't say anything.  |p130Gerhart  was smiling kindly and saying : Now I do n't mean no disrespect to Margie . I think Margie 's a fine girl . Yessir , a fine girl . ' His voice became paternally gentle . But you know how things are , Red . Here you are , way out here . You 've been away eleven months . You 'll be out here a hell of a lot longer . Margie , she 's a normal healthy girl . She 's got those desires same as all of us . Hell , Red , you ca n't blame her if she has a little fun once in a while . A pretty girl like that . No sir , you got to figure on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while we 're standing here , Margie might be droppingher pants and crawling into bed .. That was when Red hit him . Wiley saw it coming , but he moved too late to stop it . There was a spanner wrench lying on top of the ready box just aft of the gun . It was two steps away from Red . Before Wiley could even raise his hand , Red had taken those two steps , grabbed the wrench , and hit Gerhart with it on the side of the head as hard as he could . He was drawing his arm back to hit Gerhart again when Wiley finally was able to move , and he grabbed Red 's arm and stopped him . Gerhart curled up and dropped to the deck and the blood was running from his head . And all the time Red had n't said one word or made a sound . He was actually smiling when Wiley took the wrench away from him . It took thirteen stitches to close up the side of Gerhart'shead and he was in sick-bay for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers on the court were sympathetic and he was only fined twenty-five dollars . Big Gerhart , as soon as he was up and around ,  |p131started  threatening that he would take Red apart , but the crew was all on Red 's side , and it was made amply clear to Gerhart that he would do nothing of the sort . In fact , the only result of the incident , except for the stitches and the fine , was that Red was shifted to the five-inch gun crew . And the only result of that was that on a hot day the watches went slower than ever for Big Gerhart up on the three-inch.  |p132THE  CREW WAS CERTAINLY RIPE for a good liberty when the Reluctant got orders to sail to Elysium in the Limbo Islands . The ship was three years out of the States and of her original crew there were only four members left . These were Johnson , the chief master/at-arms , and Yarby , the chief yeoman , and Olson and Dowdy . These four could and often did talk of liberties spent together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Panama ; and the crew would listen , excludedand jealous , to this reminiscence , and they would feel the unity and completeness of the four , and then they would go away sad  --  certain that this was something they would never have . In three years , their total liberty had consisted of three afternoon recreationparties on one of the inevitable islands , at which a couple of bottles of beer per man were doled out , and where a few of the more frustrated played a listless game of softball . That was n't liberty  --  it was mockery of the word . The crew lived together and worked togetherand were bored together ; they needed to play together , to remember playing together , and to be able to talk about having played together . Where was the tie of solidarity working in the smothering bottom of the hold ? What was the bond of union standing the heated watches ? They needed to raise hell together . So the news that they were going , not to Apathy again , nor to Tedium , nor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an explosion . The word spread as infallibly as a pestilence , and a great deal faster . Not more than fifteen minutes after Lieutenant ( jg ) Billings , the communicator , got the inspiredmessage , everyone on the ship knew about it . Hey , did you get the word ? ' men shouted at one another . This bucket 's going to Elysium ! ' And with The Word were passed the few available facts on the place :  | that it was down in a nice climate , well away from the Equator , and that it was a lovely , civilized town of thirty thousand population , a British colonial town , and in peacetime quite a celebrated tourist stop on the steamer track from Australia to the States . As soon as the bald Word and these preliminary facts were thoroughly disseminated , the crew set to work to get additional information . They questioned all , and finally found one man who had been to Elysium in peacetime . That was Dowdy . Dowdy immediately became the target of a barrage of excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and factually . Yes , it used to be a nice place ; although he did n't know what it was like now with the Army there . The only women you could get were the natives , and most of them were dark and pretty rough . Some of them , though , were real beauties . Yes , there used to be plenty of whore-houses , but the Army probably closed them up . Maybe a few running on the sly . Liquor ?  --  the liquor 's lousy . In peacetime all they had was island gin and whiskey made from sugar-cane , and things would be even worse now . That whiskey they make , ' said Dowdy , really panther-piss . Two drinks of that will knock you on your ass like nothing you ever saw ! ' Dowdy was patient at first , but he was never patient for very long , and soon he tired of being a Baedeker . The questioners persisted all day , and they interfered with his work . His answers grew short , and then sarcastic , and finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all very beautiful and promiscuous . The pricesp135ranged from one to six shillings . All you had to do was step into a souvenir shop and announce that you wanted to see the turquoise necklaces . Dowdy did the boys no service with this information . Their natural , unencouraged expectations of Elysium were unreasonableenough without any prodding . The atmosphere of the ship was normally not what you would call electric . It fell a little short of that . But now , on the nine-day run to Elysium , there was an unmistakable galvanism in the air . It manifested itself in many distinctive ways . You would have a clue to it in the suits of whites , most of them brand-new and never-worn , that were broken out of lockers and seabags . You could have detected it in the sudden passion for shining shoes , ordinarily an affectation as neglected as manicuring . Louie Wilkes , the barber , could have told you something was up from the fact that he now worked twelve hours a day cutting hair . Normally he got customers only during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canteen could have furnished the incontrovertibleevidence : the sale during the first two days of the eighteen jars of Mum which it had carried in stock for three years . Another conclusive indication was the sudden boom in prophylactics , also a very neglected item on the shelves of the canteen . ( There was much bitterness about these prophylactics ; they were so old , had been carried in stock for so long , that when the crew tested them by filling with water about ninety per cent turned out to be defective . ) In these rather direct ways the crew was getting ready for a liberty . One of the mess cooks hung a calendarin the messhall and every night with much ceremonyhe would X out a day . There was a red circle drawn around the ninth , the date of arrival . Stefanowskigot fifty men to chip in five dollars apiece to an anchor pool , the first time in two years that any interest had been demonstrated in the time of the ship 's arrival . At night after the tables had been cleared away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little groups and in large groups , and talk and plot and plan . Everythingwas planned to the nicest detail . Cliques were formed , costs were calculated , obstacles were considered , individual projects were announced . No military campaign was ever more elaborately prepared for . There was one curious and , as it turned out , ironic thing about the crew 's plans for Elysium : the way , by their very nature  --  violent , carnal , orgiastic  --  that they precluded David Bookser from participation . This was not intentional on the part of the crew  --  they liked Bookser to a man  --  but since there was such unanimous agreement on a program that included no spiritual values , they just automatically counted him out . He represented the spirit on the Reluctant and it was rather lonely and valiant of him to do this . David Bookser , a seaman in the first division , was a beautiful boy . He looked spiritual : he was a pure Adonis : his features were fine and flawless , his skin almost transparently white , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ringlets . He did not look effeminate , though , and the crew did not regard him that way.  |p137They  were a little stunned by his beauty , even the dullest clod of them , and they made a sort of pet of Bookser . He was a quiet , earnest boy , and a hard worker , and he was going to enter the ministry when he got out of the Navy . The one time the crew held a Happy Hour , ' devoted almost entirely to skits of the broadest and most animalistic sort , Bookser stole the show with his poised , true singing of Adeste Fideles . ' Because the crew liked Bookser , they rode him a great deal ; but he was a match for them . All the way to Elysium , because the Elysium erected in the mind of the crew seemed such a classic antithesis of Bookser , he came in for a lot of attention . It tickled the crew members , the idea of Bookser loose in this blazing Sodom they were going to . Hey , Booksie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Elysium ? Dowdy says he knows just the girl for you . ' Or , more bluntly : Hey , Booksie , what do you say we go over and get laid ? You and me , huh ? How about it ? ' Or , subtly : Hey , Booksie , how about selling me your liberty ? You ai n't going to be using it , are you ? ' And Bookser would take all this and smile and say in his soft voice , not at all flustered : No , thanks . I think I 'll just go over and walk around . ' That was the way it went , all the way to Elysium . The Reluctant sailed through cool blue days and shining blue water , and came at last to the Limbop138Islands of the Pacific . It reached them six hours ahead of schedule , and possibly it was speeded along by the intense well-wishing of the crew . At daylight there they were , the wonderful Limbos , a faint , water-color line hovering low along the horizon . The entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this line emerge from insubstantial tracery into clear , solid mass , beautiful with trees and tall brown hills and green fields neatly criss-crossed in the valleys . They were lovely islands , like nothing the crew had ever seen in the Pacific . The ship , following the channel , slipped in close ashore , and now with the naked eye the men could make out houses perched on the slopes , and people moving about , and even the sex of the people . Before they thought , many exclaimed , Holy Christ , there 's a woman , look ! ' And then they reflected , and remembered that a woman was now a commonplace  --  that these islands thronged with lovely women waiting for them  --  and they shut up , abashed . They stood quiet and watched , soaking up strange impressions , while the ship steamed along the coast . It was two hours later that the Reluctant rounded the tip of the island , swung wide in the stream , and there , then , scatteredand bright in the bowl of the dark hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they yelled . Elysium had very much taken their fancy . It ran up from the bay to the rim of the hills , red and green slate roofs and fine stucco houses pastel-shaded , and straight , narrow streets shady under tall trees , and it all had the warm , gay look of a waterp139color . There were handsome public buildings and even two buildings of six or seven stories . There were cars and people moving about . The crew pounded each other on the back and yelled . They yelled , Elysium , here I come ! ' and they yelled , Hey , Dowdy , where 's the whore-houses ? ' and they yelled , When does liberty start ? ' The excitement was so extreme that when the ship finally tied up to a dock shortly after noon , it was n't even commented upon that Stefanowski had won his own anchor pool  --  two hundred and fifty dollars . Then began a maddening period of preparation and of waiting . On the theory that it had at least a one-inthreechance of making the liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stripped down to scivvies , ready for a lightning change into whites . Plans made eight days ago were affirmed and reaffirmed . Money was borrowed . Dowdy was questionedexhaustively on the exact location of the whorehouses . David Bookser was seriously approached by five different people wanting to buy his liberty . When the hell does liberty start ? ' was repeated everywhere like an incantation . There was one final twist of torture . It was all that was needed : it had the effect of exploding the head of steam . While the crew huddled in the compartment , the word reached them that the Captain was n't going to grant any liberty . Screw them ! ' the Captain was quoted as telling the exec . They try to screw me , now I 'll screw them ! ' The crew sat like dead men : they had never even considered anything like this . That there might be poor liberty , yes ; that it might be three- or even four-section liberty , yes ; but that there not be liberty  --  no ! But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Captain , there came a miraculous , inexplicable change in official plans , and the P.A. speaker squawked exultantly : Li-ber-ty . . . will commence . . . immediately . . . for the starboard section ! ' It was all right then ; it was wonderfully all right ! Twosectionliberty !  --  even the port section took consolation in that . And the starboard section dived for its whites . Lieutenant ( jg ) Ed Pauley , the officer-of-the-deck , had a hectic time at the gangway . At one time he had to inspect the liberty cards and check out seventy-three men of a seventy-four-man liberty list . They swarmed around the gangway and pushed and shoved and in general behaved exactly like men leaving a sinking ship by the only escape hatch . He breathed a sigh of relief when they were finally gone . Fifteen minutes later the last man on the list , David Bookser , came up to the gangway . Pauley checked him out . Well , take it easy , Booksie , ' he grinned . Yes , sir , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the dock , all alone . Poor kid , ' Pauley thought , what the hell 's he going to do over there ? ' He smiled a little at the idea . Lieutenant Carney said he hoped the ship never had another liberty if it meant watches like the one he hadp141that night . Carney had the eight-to-twelve , and he caught it all . It was the first time he had really been busy since he came aboard . The Doctor , too , had more business in that four-hour span than in the total sick calls of the last year . Lieutenant ( jg ) Langston , with the four-to-eight , had a quiet watch . There was only one minor incident , although a prophetic one . Ringgold of the third division staggered up the dock leading a goat by the halter and tried to bring the goat aboard . Langston intervened , and Ringgold and the goat wandered amiably off . That was the only thing on Langston 's watch . Carney had been on watch only five minutes when a Navy pickup truck stopped on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back end were five bodies in white uniforms . These are your boys , ' the shore patrol called , come and get ' em : The gangway P.O. and the messenger dragged the five aboard , one by one . They were out cold , and because they were filthy with vomit and dirt , Carney ordered them laid out on top of number three hatch . They were soon to have a lot of company . Ten minutes later the truck returned . It carried three more bodies in back , and in the front seat was Ringgold . The charge against him was stealing a goat . The shore patrol submitted it on a yellow slip to Carney . The bodies joined the others on top of number three . The truck was back again in fifteen minutes , this time with twelve bodies . A few minutes later , Costello , three other first division men , and two M.P . ' s piled out teeth missing and several men had what appeared to be burns . Carney turned them over to the Doctor . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . Even those who were unconscious had a peaceful smile on their faces . The shore patrol spoke ill-naturedly of a big fight with some soldiers in a dance hall . The shore patrol looked tired . It took half an hour to put that bunch away . Then the Doctor went along number three hatch examining the bodies with a flashlight . The hatch cover was gettingcrowded . At eleven-thirty , just when Carney was thinking he might get through the watch without further incident , a Navy station wagon stopped at the gangway . Four shore patrolmen got out , two officers and two enlisted men . The enlisted men , wearing forty-fives , stationed themselves at the foot of the gangway . The officers came on up . The Commander of the Naval Base , they said , had ordered the sentries stationed to prevent anyone , officer or man , from leaving the ship during the rest of its stay in Elysium . The immediate reason was that some sailors , certainly members of this crew , had broken into the home of the French consul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By this time he was well beyond surprise . As they turned to go , one of the officers asked : How long since these guys made a liberty , anyway ? ' Carney told him . The officer shook his head wearily and went on down the gangway . That was all then . Pauley , who had the mid-watch ,  |p145had  an easy time . A few more bodies were brought aboard , and at two o'clock one of the bodies already laid out revived and tried to slide down the bow spring line . Those were the only incidents . Otherwise peace settled soddenly on the Reluctant . The liberty was over . With the matin clarity of the new day , certain significantdetails of the liberty were revealed . The members of the starboard section were coherent this morning , although not inclined to be talkative , and from their information it was possible to reconstruct the evening . Upon leaving the ship , the entire section had repaired to the local saloons , where it spent the afternoon and early evening drinking native gin and cane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evidenceon top of number three , these were sturdy and mature drinks . By nine o'clock they had mowed down half of the starboard section . The main body of the survivors , about twenty strong , had marched upon a USO dance given for the Army . They were made to feel unwelcome there . The fight , while short , was intense . A few of the hostesses got caught in the middle of things and lost much of their clothing . The Chinese lanterns burning overhead were pulled down and accounted for numerous first-degree burns . The Reluctant contingent , outnumbered three to one , was at least holding its own when the M.P . ' s arrived . In addition to this main force there were several diversionary groups . Although no one would admit to direct knowledge of this , it was conceded that perhaps one small group had visited the home of the French consul . The rumor was that a whimsical taxi-driver had advertised it as a whore-house . The visitors were justifiablyangry when they found no girls in the darkened house , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown a large world globe through the living-room window . A few other small patrols , such as those of Costello and Denowsky , had fanned to the outskirts of the town and found employment there . This , in outline , completed the picture of the evening . The big news , though , was that David Bookser had not returned from liberty . This news startled everyone . A few of the crew remembered having seen him walkingforlornly about town in the early afternoon , but no one recalled seeing him after three o'clock . It is interestingthat the unanimous verdict of officers and crew was that Bookser had somehow met with foul play . It was n't even considered that he might simply be overleave . The exec sent Ensign Keith ( escorted by the wary shore patrol ) over to the Naval Base Commander to request a search for Bookser . The Reluctant was three more days in Elysium . It was a time of healing and of aftermath . Schlemmer was released from jail when Ensign Keith went over and paid his fine . He was released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation , could not be found to press charges . On the second day the Captain was summoned to the Base Commander'soffice . Afterward it was joyously circulatedp147that he had gotten a royal ass-eating , and it was proudly reported that the Base Commander had informed him the ship would never be permitted to return to Elysium . On the third day two hundred dollars was withdrawn from the welfare fund and paid to a native truck farmer as reparation for one cow , deceased . And still there was no trace of Bookser . The crew was visibly disturbed about this . Most still thought that Bookser had met with foul play  --  one of them Army bastards . ' A few more argued that Bookser had just gone over the hill  --  a religious kid like that , you know , he probably just got fed up . ' Two or three advanced theorists thought that Bookser had been stricken with something like amnesia . All were sorry that he was gone . When they talked of him now , it was in an elegiac way . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past tense . Except for the shadow that Bookser cast , the entire membership of the crew was in good spirits . The officerswondered about this . There was certainly ample cause for the port section to feel deadly enmity toward the starboard section ; and yet an atmosphere of abnormalfriendliness prevailed . On the last night in Elysium the reason for this good fellowship was made clear . Wiley , the gunner 's mate , came up to Mr. Langston , the O.O.D. , and asked if it was true that the ship was sailing in the morning . Mr. Langston said it was . Wiley scratched his head and said , Well , in that case I guess we better .. : He leaned over and talked low into Langston 's ear . Mr. Langston almost jumped . Holy Christ , yes ! ' he croaked . Get her off of here ! ' Wiley scampered below and returned a moment later leading a bewildered-looking native girl by the hand . The girl was dark and squat and rather ugly , and she wore sandals and a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Malina , ' said Wiley , as he led her past the gaping Langston and on down the gangway . Thanks ! ' he said to Langston as he bounded aboard again . Langston had recovered a little and asked : How did she get aboard ? ' Wiley said easily : Oh , Sam Insigna brought her out that first night . He tried to get her up a ladder on this side , but Mr. Carney seen him , so Sam got a bumboat and brought her out to the other side . ' Where in hell did you keep her ? ' Langston said . Down in hawser stowage . They fixed it up nice for her down there . ' Wiley grinned , and added an afterthought : She liked it on here . She made four hundred some bucks ! ' The ship sailed next morning at ten . At breakfast time even those who had held out hope gave Bookser up for lost . He came back at nine-thirty . The deck divisions were standing by to handle lines , and the second division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were gathering on the bridge and the signalmen on the flying bridge . A majority of the crew was witness to the manner of Bookser 's return . An American-make car drove along the docks ; a girl driving , a sailor with her . The car turned into thep149entrance to a warehouse , a little distance from the gangway , and stopped . Perhaps the two in the car thought they could n't be seen there . They could : they were . The men on deck watched , and the signalmen on the bridge watched , and after a moment the signalmenwatched with binoculars . And this is what they all saw : They saw this girl . With the naked eye the men on deck could see that she was pretty . With the glasses , the signalmen saw that she was beautiful . Her skin was burnished gold and her hair a black , glistening shawl about her shoulders . Her forehead was high and proud and her eyes were blue . The signalmen could see the tears in her eyes as she turned to the sailor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lovely hair ; and the deckhands watched and the signalmen watched . The kiss grew and lengthened and tightened and became the embrace of farewell ; and the hands of the two ran helplessly down each other 's bodies ; and these hands told everything to the signalmen with the 7-50 binoculars . Then Bookser got out and the car drove away . When Bookser came aboard and started forward to the compartment , the men on deck swarmed about him . They closed in with noisy cries and on their lips were eager , impatient questions . And then they stopped . There was something about Bookser that silenced them , something strange and high and inaccessible . He was pale and listless , and in his eyes there was sadness , and something worlds far away . Hello , ' he said quietly , and he gave a little crooked smile . And the crew was suddenlyhumble before him . The coarse , impatient questionsdied on their lips and in their place came reverent , hesitant ones . Were you with her all the time , Booksie ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Booksie ? ' Over in the church , ' Bookser said vaguely . Who does she live with ? ' She lives alone up on top of the hill . ' What was her name , Booksie ? ' Lenora . Lenora Valencia . ' How did you know to come back before we sailed ? ' Her uncle , ' Bookser said dully . Her uncle is foremanof the stevedores here . ' And then , as Bookser turned to go , Steuben , the yeoman , asked the necessary , inevitable question . He asked it with infinite respect . Booksie , were you shacked up with her ? ' There was a little silent moment . Bookser looked at them , and there was pride in his eyes , and defiance , and this awful loneliness . He nodded slowly . Then , slowly , he went down to the compartment . The ship sailed then . It was a blue , shiny morning and a spanking off-shore breeze corrugated the surface and streaked its vivid blue with white . The Reluctant steamed along the coastwise channel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Elysium slipped astern , receded , diminished in scale against the dome of the sky . The fresh breeze blew on the facesp151of the crew lined along the rails , and they felt good . They were leaving Elysium , the only civilization the ship had known in three years ; they were going back to obscene waters and steaming islands and sweating days and nights , and still they felt good . They felt good in the same way that an old and happy couple feels good , or that soldiers feel good after a battle , or that any group with the bright bond of communal achievementfeels good . The crew was a unit at last , and the common artery of participation ran through and bound together such distant and diverse characters as Costello and Wiley and Ringgold and Schlemmer . They stood along the rail in little groups ; but these were accidental groups with interchangeable membership , and not the tight , jealous cliques of old . Stuzyuiski and Kalinka , the shipfitter , who had n't spoken to each other in a year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had a good thing under their belts , a cherished package waiting to be opened , a prize awaiting distribution . When Elysium was small in the distance and without detail , like something seen through ' the wrong end of a pair of binoculars , they opened the package . Each group opened it at about the same time , and each opened it the same way : slowly , gently , lovingly . One man would open his corner of it : Did you see me clip that big sergeant at the dance ? One of them gals had her blouse torn and one of her tits hanging out , and he was gawking at her , and I stepped up and caught him right on the button ! '  | And another would open it a little more : Yeah , and did you see me ! I was standing up by the bandstand and this soldier takes a dive at me and I seen him coming and stepped out of the way and he went right on through that big goddamn drum ! ' And a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gal Insigna kept down in number two ? Did you know she got loose one night and started wandering around and she was just heading into officers ' country when they caught her ! ' And finally , and proudly , the real heart of the package , the prize , the essence , was exposed : But did you hear about Bookser ! That crazy little son-of-a-gun went over there all by himself and got shacked up with the most beautiful gal you ever saw ! The signalmen said she was absolutely beautiful ! They say he met her in a church over there  --  a church , for Christ 's sake ! And she kept him up at her house and he stayed over-leave and she brought him back just in time to catch the ship ! Bookser , for Christ 's sake ! ' These things are quite symphonic in their development . Now , at first , the theme was stated simply and quietly . Later on , at chow , in the compartment , on the crawling night watches , it would be embellished and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one man would add something new and isolated that happened , and another would insert something that did n't happen , but should have . That way the thing would grow and take shape , and finally , when it was rich and rounded and complete , it would sum/marily be scrapped and a new structure begun from the same material . There was plenty of material : the crew had struck a rich vein at Elysium . It was one which would build them a wall of strength against the attack of buttressed miserable days and nights . And while the crew stood examining this rich thing , the solitary figure of David Bookser emerged from the compartment hatchway . Bookser had changed to dungarees , and now for a moment he stood blinking in the sunlight . It might have been a cue , the way all eyes turned to him . With the slow , mechanical step of a sleepwalker he started up the fo'c'sle . The groups broke and made way for him . They smiled at him and called to him : they spoke with warm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beloved officer like Mr. Roberts . Several men sitting on bitts got up and offered their seats to Bookser . But Bookser just smiled a sad , vague smile and nodded his head and kept going . He walked up to the very prow , and he stood there and turned his head back toward the pinpointcluster of Elysium and did n't move . The crew stayed on deck for quite a while , until the islands began to grow dubious on the horizon . Then one by one , and in twos and threes , they went below : to work , to sleep , to sit and talk . Finally Bookser alone was left . He stood in the prow like a statue . Then , when the line of the islands was finally gone from the sky , he too went below . He went down to take among the crew his rightful place as hero-elect of a legend in the making.  |p154LIEUTENANT  ROBERTS was the only one on the ship who gave a damn about the war in Europe , and he cared profoundly . Scarcely anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . And it was a time of great news . Now , in the last days of April and the first daysp155of May , 1945 , the Third Reich lay in its death throes . Peace for much of the world was only days away , maybehours . It had already been rumored and denied , rumored and denied again . It was a time as exciting and , in the best sense , as great as the world had ever known : and in its minute displacement of the Pacific Ocean , the Reluctant went about its business and did n't even look up . Its talk was of worn and familiar things : the States , the chow in the messhall , the movies , the recent trip to Elysium , and long and always , the Captain . Once in a while a man would ask another , They still fighting over there in Europe ? ' but he did it only to display his global awareness . He did n't really care . Germany writhed in the awful constriction of Allied and Russian armies , vomited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lieutenant Roberts sat for hours at a time in the radio shack with a headset on his ears , listening to the fading , crackling voices of the shortwave broadcasts . It was seldom that the ship was at an island owning a radio station , and much of the time shortwave was the only means of getting the news . The phonograph in the wardroom , endlessly tended by Carney or Billings or Langston , endlessly whining the sick , scratchy , distorted lovesongsof two years ago  --  ' I ' 11 Never Smile Again , " You 'll Never Know , " Wrong , Would It Be Wrong to Care '  --  drove Roberts to the headset in the radio shack . It was virtually impossible to silence the monotone nostalgia of the turntable long enough for a news broadcast.  | Once Roberts had persuaded Billings , the communicator , to put out every morning a sheet of mimeographedpress news . The experiment lasted only a week , and even Roberts had to admit its failure . The copies were being tossed unread into the trash baskets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news came of the final surrender of Germany . The Reluctant lay at anchor in the bay of one of the islands . It was early evening when the word came , the four-toeightwatch ; and Roberts had the watch . Because there was no gangway down , he stood it on the bridge . There were several difficulties with the Captain . First the quartermaster dropped a megaphone on the deck of the wheelhouse , and the Captain was heard from on that . His cabin was directly below , and he could n't stand noise overhead of any sort . At night , awakening him from sleep , an object dropped on the deck overheadwould send him nearly out of his mind with rage . Then , after the first incident , it was n't ten minutes until the Captain came up on the bridge again . He was obviously looking for trouble , and he found it . He saw a group of men on the foredeck leaning on the rail . Leaning on the rail was his currently favorite prohibition . He stormed over to Lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down there ? ' he demanded . Roberts looked up with the minor annoyance of aman brushing away a fly . He nodded complacently . Well ! ' shouted the Captain . What 're you going todo about it ? '  |p157Roberts  looked around indifferently and summoned the messenger . Go down and tell those men to get off the rail , ' he said casually . The Captain 's mustache bristled . His face and neck got red . Get off the rail , nothing ! ' he shouted . You get their names and , by God , you put them on report . You get those men on report in a goddamn quick hurry or , by God , I 'll take care of you ! ' He started muttering then and walking agitatedly about . He never was a match for Roberts and he knew it . Roberts turned wearily to the messenger . Go down and get their names , ' he said . The way he said it , it was understood that they were humoring a foolish child . Then he turned and walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a familiar monologue : By God , what do you think I make these orders for  --  just to be doing something ? By God , when I say something 's going to be done , it 's going to be done , or , by God , I 'll take care of you officers ! Bet your ass I will . . : A few minutes later , when Thompson , the radioman , came out and told Roberts that Germany had just surrendered unconditionally , he forgot all about the Captain . As soon as he was relieved , Roberts went into the radio shack and put on the headset . The air was full of the great news . Roberts heard a transcription of the rolling eloquence of Churchill . He heard the text of the President 's proclamation from Washington . He heard the quiet , controlled exultation of General Eisenhower . He heard the news commentators . They talked from Reims , from somewhere in Germany , ' from Paris , from Rome , from Lisbon , from London . They told of the celebration in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the world had never known . There were splendid fireworks in Paris over the Place de l'Opera . There were snake dances through the streets of Rome . In London , the pubs were jammed and the streets were jammed . Flags and bunting instantaneously bloomed from the buildings , and there were parades of crack Guard regiments . In New York , Times Square , of course , was thronged . Ticker-tape rained from Wall Street windows . The universal joy was only feebly relieved by cognizance of the still unwon Pacific war . Roberts sat for a long time at the headset : it must have been two hours that he listened . When one station went off the air , he switched to another . Almost franticallyhe would seek out a new station . Finally the news programs were all off the air , or repeating themselves . Finally there were only the sad iterations of American dance music on the radio bands . Roberts got up then . The movie was just letting out . There were sudden shouts in the passageways , and the loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fo'c'sle . It must have been a good movie . Hearing them , Roberts felt a sudden loneliness . He felt a vague sorrow and , pressing just behind it , an awful sick despair that he had lived with for a long , familiar time . He needed suddenly to talk to someone . He needed to tell them the news , and he needed , in return , some strange assur/ante ; and this was not understood . He went down to the wardroom . Carney and Billings were alone in there . They pored over their acey-deucey game . The phonograph played Paper Doll . ' There was a crack in the record that clicked at every turn . The big fan droned in the corner . Roberts stood over them for a moment . The war 's over in Europe , ' he said . Germany has surrendered . ' He stood waiting . Carney looked up politely . Yeah ? ' he said . Then , evidently feeling that some amplifying comment was indicated , he added : Well , that ought to speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' said Billings , it should . ' He picked up the dice . What 's the name of the game ? ' he asked . Acey-deucey , ' said Carney . Acey-deucey , ' said Billings . He rolled the dice . There it is . ' Roberts smiled a little and went out . He should have known better than to expect anything else . No one could help him because no one gave a hoot in hell what went on beyond the confines of this ship . It was to the rest of the officers a matter of indifference that a war of supreme horror had ended . Just to establish this , Roberts went around and told his friends the news . Lying in bed reading a year-old Street and Smith detectivemagazine , Ed Pauley agreed substantially with Carney : Well , maybe they 'll get on the ball out here now . ' Ensign Pulver was languidly militant : I guess wep160took care of the bastards good this time ! ' Ensign Moulton was cynical : That 'll hold them for another twenty years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hitler ? Finally Roberts went to the Doc 's room . If anyone could help , it would be the Doc . The Doctor was reading at his desk . The desk light shone on his forehead and on the bald part of his head . Without seeming to shift his eyes , he shot a quick , sharp glance at the doorway . Come in ! ' he called to Roberts . He put the book aside . Sit down . Take a load off . ' Hi , Doc , ' said Roberts . He sat down in the chair beside the desk , locked his hands behind his head , and leaned back against the bulkhead . The war is over in Europe . Germany surrendered unconditionally at Reims . ' The Doctor stroked his mustache thoughtfully . That 's fine , ' he said . That 's really splendid news . Has it been announced from Washington ? ' Roberts nodded . That 's very wonderful news , ' said the Doc softly . Very wonderful . ' Roberts kept his hands locked behind his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said slowly . The most horrible war in history has just ended . A terrible war , Doc , a truly terrible one . You would expect this , then , to be a time of the wildest general rejoicing . And what do I feel ?  --  Doc , I feel depressed as all hell . What do you make of that ? ' The Doctor squinted his eyes and leaned back in hisp161chair . Well , ' he said , I should n't think that so remarkable . With anything as consummately absorbing as a great war there 's always a great deal of transference . You know : the great general conflict swallows the little individual conflicts . Also there 's the matter of war considered as a spectacle . War is a hell of a hypnotic and buoyant thing  --  viewed from a distance , a considerable distance  --  and it 's quite reasonable to expect a letdown when it ends . ' Roberts shook his head and smiled . No , ' he said . It 's not like that at all . I guess I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is . So do you . It 's just that I feel left out . I wanted in that war , Doc . I wanted in it like hell . Does that sound stupid ? ' No , ' said the Doc , but it is rare . ' He lighted a cigarette . You never did satisfactorily explain to me how come you 're so all-fired anxious to fight this war . ' I do n't know that I could , ' said Roberts . I do n't know how you go about explaining a compulsion . That 's what it is , of course . ' Roberts had a crooked smile . Did I ever tell you , ' he went on , what a long and consistent record I have as a frustrated anti-fascist ? ' The Doctor shook his head and exhaled smoke . I think you omitted that . ' Well , I have , ' said Roberts . A truly distinguished record of frustration . When I was eighteen I quit high school and went to New York and got signed up as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war was over before they could ship me out . ' He scratched his ear . But I guess there was n't much antifascismto that . It was just a hell of a gaudy thing to do . I was quite a hero when I left . ' Then , ' he went on , in 1940 , in my last year of premed , I quit school again . This time I went up to Montreal and tried to get in the RAF . I think by then I honestly had an idea of what was involved . It was strictly nothing doing , though '  --  he tapped his teeth  --  ' they threw me out on this foolish malocclusion . Same thing in 1941 when I tried to get in the Air Corps  --  all three of them . They would n't have anything to do with me . This is the only outfit that would have me . ' The Doc looked thoughtfully at Roberts . You give this war a lot , do n't you ? ' Yes , I do , ' said Roberts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doc agreed . I do n't . I see it as a war of unrelieved necessity  --  nothing more . Any ideology attaching is only incidental . Not to say accidental . ' Well , ' said Roberts , no need for us to go into that again . But Doc , if you had asked me four years ago I could have told you to hell and back what this war was about . I would have overwhelmed you with moral superiority . I would have used terms like " war against fascism , " " holy war , " " crusade , " and so forth . I would have defined fascism as a revolution against the human soul , and I would have talked of the forces of good and evil . And perhaps , Doc , there was a lot of justice in that sort of talk . Perhaps there still is : I do n't know . It seems to me that causes are hellishly elusive things , and that the moment you try to articulate them , givep163them a label , they shy away and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' He paused . I guess the minimum thing I 'd say now is that the war seems to me  --  or should I say seemed  --  immensely worth while ( positively and consciously and inherently , that is  --  not accidentally , as you say ) , and that I feel a hell of a compulsion to be in it . ' He held up his hands quizzically and looked at the Doctor . The Doc was quiet a moment ; then he said : I could kick your ass for ever leaving med school . ' So could I , ' said Roberts . Now . Particularly now . Particularly today . I chase the hell out of this war and it quits on me . ' I would remind you that there is still a war out here which you may very well see plenty of . ' Roberts shook his head . Not a chance . I 've sat on this bucket this long . I 'll sit here now till it 's over . ' And I would further remind you , ' said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you 're on this bucket instead of in a grave in Germany . ' Roberts grinned . What an enchanting thought ! ' he said . The Doctor pushed back from the desk . And I would still further remind you , ' he said briskly , that what we need is a drink . How about getting the orange juice ? ' You 're right , ' said Roberts . He went and got the orange juice and the Doc broke out the alcohol and they sat together with their drinks for over an hour . The Doc was at his best . He told some splendid stories . He told about the fairy patient of his who had tried to change his sex with a self-amputation . He told a couple of fine stories about alcoholics . When he left an hour later , Roberts felt some better . The Doe 's company had smothered a little of his depression . He thought now that perhaps he could sleep : it was after eleven . He went up and turned in . But he could n't sleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay and studied the lights of the island circled in the porthole . At first he tried to keep his thoughts centered on neutral , tranquil things ; but soon , like a car with a locked steering-gear , they ran helplessly out of control and he was back again with his old conflict , and thinking again of the war and the victory . He was thinking now of the celebrating cities , of the celebrating cities that had known the war . There were snake dances through the streets of Rome , they said . He tried to see Rome , but he could n't make it convincing . Paris was easier : he could see the fireworks over the massed roofs of Paris and the crowds surging along the Champs d'Elysees and upsetting chairs and tables in the boulevard cafes . Surely they would upset the chairs and tables . London he could see very well : the parading regiments and the intimately cheering crowds and the grinning soldiers and the officers weavingjust a little as they marched at the head of their companies . The pubs would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the heads of the mob to be spilled or drunk before it ever got beyond the third row , and everybody would laugh and nobody gave a damn , and way at the back someone wouldp165shout despairingly for his beer . Naked girls would appearat the balcony windows of hotel rooms and call happy things down to the streets , and then an arm would appear and drag them laughing and squealing back into the room . It would be like that in all the cities that had a stake in this day ; pushing , shouting , laughing , fighting , drinking , lovemaking ; all personal identities frenziedly submerged in the shining common identity of a fabulous victory . Roberts saw all these things in separate scenes , as though they were the changing slides of a stereoscope . And now , suddenly , the series of the tumultuous cities clicked out and in its place came a very different scene . It was a scene Roberts recognized from its origin as a picture in Life magazine . ( My knowledge of the war comes straight from Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in France , and a farmer was harrowing this field , walking behind the harrow . The furrowed rows were very straight , except in the middle of the field , where they broke and gave way for the mounded grave of a British Tommy . It looked like lovely country , green with trees , with the soft haze of distant hills in the background . The rows of the harrow detoured for just the area of the grave and then they ran on straight and unswerving . It was that way the war , too , had moved off and left the Tommy . The grave looked lonely in the bright sunshine . The dead , Roberts mused , what could you say for the dead of this war ? What could you really say ? Well , there were a lot of things you could say automatically and without thought , but they were all the wrong things ; and just this once , just this one war , anyhow , let us try to say true things about the dead . Begin by cancelling the phrase , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  we forget them , we do not honor them but in rhetoric  --  and the phrase is the badge of those who want something of the dead . If the dead of this war must have a mutual encomium , then let it be poor dead bastards . ' There is at least a little humanity in that . And let us not say of them , this time , they gave their lives ' for something or other ; for certainly there was nothing voluntary in their dying . And neither is it fair to speak of dead heroes , ' for not at all necessarily does the fact of death include the fact of heroism . Some of these dead were shining youths scornful of the sanctity of their own lives , who lived daily with terror rarefied by inevitability and died with a flawless gesture of selfimmolation : and others died as the result of injuries sustainedin falling through a privy . But , thought Roberts , if they did not live equally , they are every one equally dead ; and you could say this affirmative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequence and overwhelmingagony , they participated one hundred per cent . That was the only true thing you could say for all , but it was enough . The war demanded the shortening of how many  --  two million , five hundred and sixty thousand , two hundred and fourteen ?  --  lives , and these men were chosen . So pile them high at Austerlitz and Waterlooand Ypres and Verdun , and add a few new places , Aachen and Dunkerque and Anzio ; only do not talk lies about the dead . They are the chosen.  |p167Chosen  ? thought Roberts . Was that the right word ? Perhaps it was . Perhaps it was just the word . Maybe there was some gigantic over-all selection that named the men good enough to fight the war and consigned to ships like this the ones who were n't . Perhaps they were all , on here , something less than men in a war that demandedmen ; subtly deficient in a war that required completeness . Take the Captain ; what could be more blatant than his inadequacy ? Maybe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pauley and Carney and Billings and Keith and himself  --  and all the others . Perhaps it was that in some infallible system of measuringmen they fell short : some incompetency in the nerve endings , the white corpuscles , the adrenal gland ; the stamina of their mother , the integrity of **28;1480;TOOLONG ; the shape of their remembranceof first-known fear ; something .. . Sleep was out of the question . Roberts sat up suddenly , rubbed his eyes . Langston snored above him in a perfect monotone . He got up , and in the dark put on his clothes . He bumped against the coaster chair and made a noise , but there was no hitch in Langston 's breathing . Roberts went out and down the ladder to the quarterdeck . It was a cool night with a little breeze blowing , and overhead there were patches of clouds . Over on the island the lights burned their night vigil , and now and then a jeep or a truck went by along the beach road . Tonight , perhaps because it was a cool night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the deck . Roberts could n't see another soul on deck . He started walking up and down on the quarterdeck . V-E day aboard the Reluctant , he composed , was observedquietly , without ostentatious display , and with a grim awareness of the still unfinished Pacific war . Appropriately , the ship 's company marked the great day in restrained but distinctive fashion . Lieutenant Carney and Lieutenant ( jg ) Billings , swept up in the spirit of the moment , played a game of acey-deucey in the wardroom . Lieutenant ( jg ) Pauley celebrated with quiet taste by reading a detective magazine . Lieutenant ( jg ) Langston observed the day by retiring at nine instead of ten , and by sleeping a little more soundly than usual . Ensign Pulver was moved to the extent of rigging a new portable fan at the foot of his bunk . The gruff but lovable Captain could n't quite conceal an unusual generousnessof spirit , placing only twelve men on report during a fifteen-minute period . But in these small though significant ways it was , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Tokyo .. . And all of a sudden Roberts had to do something . And it had to be against the Captain : it had to be . This thing was suddenly just as obligatory and inevitable as his next breath ; and just the thought of it was like a door opening out of prison . And he knew right away what to do . The Captain 's palm tree . The Captain kept a small palm tree in a painted five-gallon can on the wing of his bridge , and it was the joy of his life . With slow , deadly certainty Roberts walked up to the boat deck and out on the Captain 's wing . There , in thep169corner , was the palm tree . It was very dark and he could n't hear anyone moving about on the bridge overhead . He jerked the palm out by the roots and threw it over the side . Then he took the can and scattered the loose earth about on the deck . Then he put the can down and went around aft of the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was something undone . And immediately that thing was revealed to him too . Automatically he recalled the Captain 's obsessional hatred of noise , particularly noise at night , particularly noise in the area of his cabin . He went down to the cabin deck and found what he wanted . It was a gangwaystanchion , about the size of a baseball bat , and solid lead . He went up to the port wing of the Captain'sbridge and calculated . The Captain 's bedroom was just inside , and the Captain slept athwartships . The head of his bunk was right against this bulkhead . Roberts figured : it was about three feet off the deck ; it was right about here . He swung the stanchion with all his strength against the bulkhead . Then he swung a second time and a third . The blows shook the house like an explosion . Next morning every single officer confessed to having been awakened , and Ensign Moulton , who lived just aft of the Captain , said he had been knocked almost out of his bunk . Roberts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked calmly down the ladder and around the house , and returned to his own room by the starboard ladder . He undressed carefully and got into bed.  | Langston was awake and sitting dazedly up . What the hell was that noise ? ' he mumbled . Roberts pulled the sheet up to his chin . I did n't hear any noise , ' he said . And then he added , But I do now . ' He could hear the screaming voice of the Captain , and the opening of doors , and the scurrying of many feet , as of quartermasters and messengers running down from the bridge . They were wonderfully pleasant noises . Roberts listened to them for several minutes , until be fell soundly asleep.  |p171THE  CAPTAIN 'S PALM TREE must have held for him a symbolism or complex sentimental value far exceeding that of its eye appeal , which was negligible . It must have , else how could you account for his reaction to its sabotage ? The Captain 's reaction was violent . It was roughly ten minutes past eight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his boat deck and discovered the loss . Immediately he let out a bellow for poor little Cornwall , his steward 's mate . He pointed fiercely at the loose earth strewn about the empty overturnedfive-gallon can . Do n't touch that ! ' he shouted at the bewildered Cornwall . Do n't let anybody near that ! ' It is hard to say just what his purpose might have been : perhaps in the first minutes of his grief and righteous wrath the Captain thought to make a shrine of the scene of vandalism . At any rate , later in the day he made Cornwall sweep up the mess . Then the Captain bounded up the ladder to the bridge . His face was stained deep purple as he lurched toward the microphone of the P.A. system . He had a moment of furious trouble with the switches and buttons , and then his amplified and unmistakable voice startled the morning peace . Awakening was for the crew of the Reluctant an unusuallygradual process . It began feebly at six-thirty when Chief Johnson held reveille . It continued at seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to move dazedly about . Usually it was ten o'clock or thereabouts when the process was completed . The Captain materially speeded things up this morning . His voice came to the crew like a douse of ice water : All right now , goddamit , listen to this . Some smart son-of-a-bitch has been up here and thrown my palm tree over the side , and last night he was getting smartp173and pounding on my bulkhead . Now I 'm telling you , by God , right here and now I 'm going to find out who done that if I have to tear this ship upside-down doing it . By God , I 'll do that if I have to ! Bet your ass ! There 's going to be a general court-martial for the fellowwho did that ! Now if you know anyone who had anything to do with it , you better get up here and tell me . That 's your duty , by God , that 's your duty . I can tell you right here and now that there wo n't be any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the son-ofa-bitchwho 's been getting so goddamn smart ! ' This was substantially the text of the Captain 's address . The delivered version was actually longer , but then it tended toward repetition and , in the end , incoherence . The crew listened at first with shock , then with wonder , and finally with conspicuous joy . Hey , did ya hear that ? ' they shouted at one another . ' Somebodythrew the Old Man 's tree over the side ! ' All of a sudden it was a wonderful day , and every man on the ship was instantaneously wide awake . Down in the compartment men guffawed and slapped each other on the back . There was less evident rejoicing out on deck , under the Captain 's eye , but it was there just the same . The threat of restriction depressed no one , for this was a crew of realists , all of whom knew that the ship was n't going anywhere near another liberty port after Elysium . It would have been hard to give them anythingnicer than the Captain 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. LeSueur , the executive officer , and addressed him for fifteen minutes . The pitch and volume of Captain'svoice were high . It was reported he told Mr. LeSueur that if he did n't find who threw his tree over the side and pounded on his bulkhead , by God , he 'd put him , Mr. LeSueur , in hack for ten days ! Bet your ass ! He ordered Mr. LeSueur to send a boat ashore to dig up two small palm trees and return with them . He further ordered Mr. LeSueur to set a watch on the starboard wing of the boat deck from sunset until 8 A.M. The sole duty of the watch would be to guard the two palm trees , and God help them if they went to sleep ! The Captain had a busy morning . After Mr. LeSueur he summoned and received a series of visitors . It was shrewdly noted that they were the very crew members consistently civil to him . Undoubtedly the Captain reasoned that civility constituted loyalty , and that these were his friends . All of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to pump them for information . All of them told that the Old Man had cocked his head and coyly assured them that he had a damn good idea who it was and that , by God , he 'd fix him . And all of them agreed that the Captain had n't the foggiest idea which one of his hundred-and-seventy-odd enemies had struck . The Captain was n't the only one who was curious . The entire ship 's company was excited over this unrevealedhero in their midst . They were avid to locate him and do him honor . Little thoughtful groups gatheredthroughout the day , and among them every name on the ship 's roster was carefully considered for motivep175and potentiality . The only man who was entirely free of suspicion was Whipple , the storekeeper , who lay in sick-bay with his broken leg hanging by weights and pulleysfrom the overhead . There was no agreement among the investigating groups , although certain names were mentioned more often than others . Dowdy 's name was mentioned quite a bit , and so was Olson 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dolan , the quartermaster , was another . These four were accusedcountless times during the day , but none of them , it was noted by the most perceptive , had the air of valorous achievement properly obtaining to the true culprit . Although there were several confessions , none were by credible people , and the crew was frankly baffled . The really smart boys in the crew figured it must have been an officer . An officer , they reasoned , had both greater opportunity and larger motive . These speculators were , of course , getting warm , but they never really got hot . They mentioned Lieutenant Roberts as a possibility , but they deferred him to Ensign Pulver and Lieutenant ( jg ) Ed Pauley . This was done because both Pulver and Pauley had a history of fierce and vocal threats against the Captain . Roberts never wasted his time that way . The smart boys finally settled on Pulver as their man , chiefly because he was so disarmingly unconvincing in denying his guilt . Ensign Pulver was flattered pink at the charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely willing to be the interim culprit . He found it very agreeable . He went around all day being disgustingly coy . Dowdy and Olson and Stefanowski , the machinist 's mate , met as usual that evening in the armory . They spent a very quiet , happy , and domestic time . For a long while they sat and digested the rich news of the Captain 's misfortune . Then Dowdy and Olson settled down to an acey-deucy game and Stefanowski went over to the phonograph and played Gene Autry records . At midnight Dolan came in . He had just come off watch , and he had thoughtfully acquired some eggs from the galley on his way down . He got out the hotplate , got out the frying-pan , and put the eggs on . Stefanowski looked up from his records . I hear you threw the Old Man 's tree over the side , ' he greeted . No , I did n't , ' said Dolan . He had a thoughtful look as he watched the eggs . But I know who did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from their game . Yeah ? ' said Olson . Dolan nodded slowly . Roberts did it , ' he said . Mister Roberts . I was on the bridge and I heard this splash and I saw him . He was just taking his time . ' Dowdy and Olson and Stefanowski looked at each other . Well , I 'll be damned , ' said Dowdy . Are you kidding ? ' Dolan was dead serious . No , I ai n't kidding . I saw him . ' He added fiercely , Now , goddamit , that 's just between the four of us . I ai n't told nobody . You go spreading that around and you 'll get him in trouble . '  |p177Yeah  , ' agreed Dowdy , we 'll have to keep it quiet . ' He grinned suddenly and pushed back from the aceydeucyboard . Old Roberts , ' he said admiringly . That 's all right ! By God , you might of known he done it ! ' Stefanowski smacked the workbench . You goddamn right ! He must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bulkhead too . Man , he done a good day 's work ! ' Dolan said : That is one good son-of-a-bitching officer . That really is . ' He looked to the others for agreement . Dowdy nodded with heavy authority . I know I ai n't never seen a better one . ' He turned to Olson . How about you , Tom ? ' Dowdy and Olson were the two oldtimeNavy men on the ship and the final authorities on matters naval . No , I ai n't , ' said Olson . I seen a lot of pricks , though . ' Yeah , so have I , ' said Dowdy . I 've seen some awful pricks . And the funny thing is a lot of them were mustangs . Old enlisted men . I was with a first-class boatswain 's mate once who was just a hell of a nice guy . Everybody liked him . Then they made him an officer and right away he became the biggest bastard you ever saw . Everyone hated his guts after that . ' That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to be a nice guy when you ai n't got any authority . ' We got a pretty good bunch of officers on here , ' Stefanowski said . On the whole , I mean . ' Dowdy looked at him a little coldly . You know why ,  | do n't you ? ' he said superiorly , and then he went on : Because they do n't do anything , that 's why . Because they just sit on their asses and do n't give a damn about nothing . Hell , it 's easy to be a nice guy that way , when you ai n't trying to do anything . It 's when you got work to be done , when you 've got to turn to a bunch of guys , that you can really tell a good officer . Old Roberts , ' he said ; now there is really an officer . He gets out there and turns to himself and he turns everyone else to and , by God , they still like him . He 's still a nice guy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie in their sacks and do n't bother anybody , you say they 're all right . How the hell do you know ? ' It was a strong rebuke , and Stefanowski felt it . Yeah , ' he said penitently , I guess that 's right . ' You goddamn right that 's right ! ' Dowdy snapped . Stefanowski was quiet for a decent moment . Then he said : Well , all I say is , Roberts ought to have a medal for what he did . That was sure a hell of a fine job ! ' Hell , yes , ' said Dolan . Any guy that would fix the Old Man up like that ought to have a medal . ' There was a little quiet moment while Dowdy eyed the other three strangely . Then he said with an air of decision : All right , let 's give him a medal . ' What ? ' said Stefanowski . Let 's give him a medal . ' Where you going to get it ? ' Stefanowski asked doubtfully . Dowdy said scathingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop , have n't you ? '  |p179Yeah  , ' said Stefanowski , and there was the dawn of excitement in his voice . And you got plenty of sheet brass , have n't you ? ' Stefanowski got it now . Yeah , ' he said excitedly . Hell , yes ! ' Well , all right ! ' Dowdy said triumphantly . What more do you want ? .. At four o'clock next afternoon , Lieutenant Roberts sat in his room talking with Lieutenant ( jg ) Langston , his roommate . It had been a busy day , unloading dry stores onto barges , and Roberts had been out on deck since six o'clock . He was very tired and he sat in the coaster chair and contemplated a shower while he halflistenedto Langston describing a Texas snake-hunt . There was a knock on the jamb of the opened door and Dowdy and Olson and Dolan and Stefanowski stood in the passageway . Come in , ' Roberts called . The four filed inside . Stefanowski was holding a small green box . Dowdy spoke : Could we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked significantly over at Langston . Roberts smiled . Sure , ' he said . And in answer to Dowdy 's look : That 's all right . ' Stefanowski passed the box to Dowdy . Dowdy shuffled a moment and looked again doubtfully at Langston . Then he went ahead . Well , Mr. Roberts , we just wanted to give you this . ' He handed the box to Roberts . Roberts looked puzzledly at the box . He looked at the four awkward , embarrassed men . Then , smiling quizzically , he opened the box.  |p180It  was a nice box , and it had been floored with cotton . On the cotton , very bright , lay a strange device . It was a medal cut of shining brass in the shape of a fullgrownpalm tree with overhanging fronds . Fastened at the back of the medal was a piece of gorgeous silk , blue and red and yellow , secured at the other end to a safety-pin clasp . The palm tree was embedded in a rectangular base , and words had been painstakingly cut with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words : ORDER OF THE PALMTO LIEUT . D. A. ROBERTS , FOR ACTION AGAINSTTHE ENEMY , ABOVE AND BEYOND THE CALL OF DUTY , ON THE NIGHT OF 8 MAY 1945Roberts looked at the medal for a long time . Then he smiled and passed the medal over to Langston . That 's very nice , ' he said to Dowdy , but I 'm afraid you 've got the wrong man . ' He and Dowdy looked deeply at each other , and Dowdy grinned . Yessir , ' Dowdy said . We know that , Mr. Roberts , but we 'd kind of like you to have it , anyhow , sir . ' The smile on Roberts 's face was funny and tight . He pinched the bridge of his nose . All right , ' he said , ' I ' 11 keep it . Thanks very much , all of you . ' All four were grinning proudly . Oh , that 's nothing , ' Dowdy said . Stefanowski here made it down in the shop . ' It 's a fine job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Dowdy said . The four stood awkwardly in the door . Well .. : said Dowdy . The four started out , and then Dolan turned in the doorway and blurted : There ai n't nobody that knows anything about this but us , Mr. Roberts . About the medal , I mean . Stefanowski , he did n't let anybody see it while he was cutting it . ' That 's fine , ' Roberts said , but it does n't matter . ' He wanted to say something else , something of appreciation , but before he could form the words the group was gone from the doorway . Now I 've got a medal to show my grandchildren , ' he said quietly to Langston . Langston passed the medal back . Did you take care of the palm tree ? ' he asked curiously . I must have , ' Roberts said softly ; and he smiled again that funny twisted smile . He took the box in his hands , and looked at the medal and at the absurd ribbon , read again the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in perhaps fifteen years he felt like crying.  |p182WHEN  , COMING OFF THE FOUR-TO-EIGHT WATCH , Bergstrom , the quartermaster , set out to find his friend , Thompson , the radioman , he knew exactly where to go . Thompson , he knew , would be sitting in the messhall playing Monopoly . Nominally , at least , it was Monop/oly , but it was a brand that the copyright owners would scarcely have recognized . Thompson and the rest of the faithful who sat down to play every night in port before the movies had renovated it startlingly . The way it was played in the messhall , the object was no longer to amass the most property , but rather to pull off the greatest fraud . Loaded dice , sleight-of-hand , irregular counting practices , and various other forms of collusion were injected into that normally pallid game , with the result that it became no longer a game , but a spectacle played to a noisy but appreciative gallery of after-chow loungers . No player ever went into the contest armed with less than five thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody ever won ; the game always ended when it narrowed down to two contestants of equally astronomical and ill-gotten wealth . It was a good show , and the kibitzers would demonstrate appreciatively whenever a particularlyinspired piece of larceny was exposed . Thompson , because he demonstrated a talent for the game that bordered on genius , was their favorite ; and the consensuswas that once Thompson got on the outside he would abruptly become one of the world 's wealthiest men . It was a matter of some importance Bergstrom wanted to see his friend about , having to do with borrowinga couple of dungaree shirts until the laundry came back . When he left the bridge , Bergstrom looked into the radio shack just to make sure that Thompson was n't on watch , then he went infallibly on down to the messhall . But Thompson was n't there . The game was going on and the kibitzers were gathered , but it was a half-hearted performance because Thompson was n't there cheating monstrously and laughing his head off . Bergstrom was quite surprised . For a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find his friend . He looked in the compartment , where Thompsonlived in the bunk above him , and he looked in the heads and he looked out on deck . He finally found him in the yeoman 's office . Thompson and their other great friend , Braue , the yeoman , were alone in there . Neither was talking , and both were sitting looking thoughtfully at the deck . Thompson had a kind of stare in his eyes . Bergstrom closed the door behind him . How come no game tonight ? ' he started , and then he saw that something was wrong . What 's the trouble ? ' he asked more quietly . Thompson kept his eyes fixed on the deck . This , ' he said . He handed over a crumpled dispatch blank and explained wearily while Bergstrom read it : My kid died , drowned in the ocean . Eighteen months old . I never even saw her . ' Bergstrom read on : ' . . . FUNERAL SATURDAY PLEASE TRY TO COME ALL MY LOVE FRANCES . ' He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus , I 'm sorry , Frank , ' he said . Thompson nodded in heavy acknowledgment . He raised his eyes and looked out the open porthole . That son-of-a-bitch , ' he said tonelessly , as though it were something he had already said many times tonight.  |p185What  's the matter ? ' Bergstrom asked softly . Thompson stared at him without seeming to comprehend . That dirty son-of-a-bitch , ' he said again . Then , with an effort , he answered : The Old Man . This '  --  he tapped the dispatch in his pocket  --  came in this afternoon . I went down and asked the bastard for emergencyleave to fly home . Nothing doing . " We 're not giving any emergency leaves on this ship . " I said , " Captain , this has been approved by Mr. Billings and the exec . They do n't need me up in the shack and I could be back here in a week if necessary . Before the ship even leaves here . " " Nothing doing , " he says , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves . Start it with one guy and they 'll all be running up here . " ' Thompson ground his teeth together . That dirty miserableson-of-a-bitch , ' he said with heavy stress . Bergstrom shook his head . God , that is a filthy trick , ' he said . They sat quiet for a moment . Thompson was looking again at the deck . What did Mr. Roberts tell you ? ' Braue asked thoughtfully . He told me to go over on the big island tomorrow and see the Chaplain and the flag secretary . ' Braue nodded approval . That 's right , ' he said . Those Chaplains and those people over on the beach throw a lot of weight . They can go right over the Old Man 's head and put you on a plane . ' Thompson shrugged his shoulders and did n't say anything.  | You 're going , are n't you ? ' Bergstrom asked . You 're going over , are n't you ? ' Thompson nodded . Yeah , ' he said heavily , I 'm going over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bergstrom . There 's a lot of planes going out of there . Chances are they can put you right on . ' Thompson kept his eyes fixed on the deck . He did n't say anything . After a moment , as though talking to himself , he said : It 's not the kid  --  I never saw the kid , I ca n't feel anything about her . It 's my wife . That kid was everything to her  --  God ! she loved that kid . All her letters , all she talked about was the kid . All I want to do '  --  he clenched and opened his fist and looked at the fingers  --  to be there for the funeral . If I could just get her through that , I think she 'd be all right . I could make it , too , if I could get out of here tomorrow or Thursday . ' He looked up quickly at the others . You 'll get out , ' Bergstrom said . This time tomorrow night you 'll be on a plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man of incomplete information . I 'll get out , ' he said flatly . If they wo n't do anything for me over there , I 'm going over the hill . I 've got it all figured out . ' Now take it easy , ' Braue said mildly . I 'm not kidding , ' said Thompson . Suddenly he picked up a ruler and flung it against the bulkhead ; for a moment his eyes were frantic . Then he folded his hands and said quietly : I 'm not kidding . If they wo n't do anything for me , I 'll type myself up a set of orders and forge the Old Man 's name . Then I 'll stick some clothesp187in a bag and go over there again Thursday and get on a plane . I could be home before the Old Man knows what hit him . ' Braue and Bergstrom glanced at each other . Take it easy , Frank , ' Braue said uncomfortably . You ca n't do that . ' Thompson looked coolly at them . I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him closely , knew that this was n't just talk . He saw and measured his friend 's desperateintensity , and felt it equal to almost anything . He spun a paperweight on the desk . Well , ' he said finally , you wo n't have to do that . This time tomorrow night you 'll be on a plane . You wait and see . ' Thompson did n't say anything . After a while , because he had the four-to-eight again in the morning , Bergstrom left the two still sitting in the yeoman 's office and went down and turned in . It was stifling hot in the compartment , and he lay in his bunk a long time and could n't sleep . He smoked a cigarette and thought of Thompson . He remembered the desperation he had seen on Thompson 's face . Goddamn , Bergstrom thought , he 's really taking it hard . He 's really poundinghis head against the wall . It was after midnight when he finally got to sleep , and Thompson still was n't in his bunk . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside the bunk . He looked into the top bunk . Thompson was there , lying on his back , head propped on a pillow , wide staring awake.  | Take it easy , ' Bergstrom whispered . I 'm all right , ' Thompson answered . I 'm just going to San Diego , that 's all . ' Naw , take it easy , ' Bergstrom said . I 'll see you tonight . ' He went up to take the watch . At eight o'clock , when he came off , Thompson had already gone ashore . It was a long ride over to the big island , and Bergstrom knew the boat would be late getting back . It was threethirtyin the afternoon , almost time to take the watch again , when Thompson returned . Bergstrom was digging in his locker for cigarettes when Thompson came down to the compartment . Whew ! ' said Thompson , and flopped wearily across Bergstrom 's bunk . His dungarees were salt-streaked where they had dried from wetting , his face and arms were sunburned pink , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a moment he pulled himself up and sat on the edge of the bunk , and with infinite slowness untied his shoelaces . Then he kicked off his shoes and grinned suddenly at Bergstrom . Wow ! ' he said , what a day ! ' Still smiling curiously , he shook his head . Two hours over , and two hours back , and taking seas both ways . And walk , Jesus , did I walk ! ' With the same patient weariness he started to unbutton his shirt . Bergstrom watched him . How did you make out ? ' he asked . Thompson stretched and pulled off his shirt . No soap , ' he said . I went to the Chaplain and I went to the flag secretary and they both told me the same thing : if the Captain would n't approve it , I could n't get anyp189emergency leave . They said it was all up to the Captain . So '  --  he was examining the sunburn on his arms  --  I went over to the Red Cross and they got off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' said Bergstrom . That 's too bad . I thought they could probably do something for you . ' Thompson got up and peeled off his trousers . He shook his head . Could n't do a thing . I really felt lousy when they told me that ; I really felt bad . I had about three hours before the boat shoved off and so I just started walking . I walked for three hours , up one road and down another , way up past some Seabee camp , and up a little mountain and down along the beach  --  I did n't give a damn where I was going . I just had to walk  --  I really felt mean . I got so far away I had to run the last mile to catch the boat . I must have walked at least twenty miles all together , but I felt better when I got through . I felt a hell of a lot better . ' He stood in his shorts and the sudden , curious grin came back to his face . Jesus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've done in four years . I 'll be stiff as a board tomorrow . ' Bergstrom was about to say again that he was sorry they could n't do anything , but Thompson seemed already to have forgotten it . So he said : I 'll see you at eight , ' and went up for the watch . He was glad to see that Thompson was taking it all right . He was glad to see that he was n't talking and acting and feeling like he did last . night . He 'd be all right now , Bergstrom figured . Probably be down in the dumps for quite a while yet , but he 'd get over that . He 'd have plenty of time to get over that . The thing to do was to talk with him and keep his mind occupied so that he would n't brood . That was Bergstrom 's purpose when he came off watch again at eight : he thought he 'd find Thompson and get him off with Braue somewhere for a bull session . When he went through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monopoly session was going full blast and Thompson was right in the middle of it . The game was noisier than Bergstrom ever remembered it , and Thompson seemed to be having a wonderful time . Some particularly choice piece of crookedness had just been pulled off and Thompson was laughing so hard that the tears came to his eyes . And , while Bergstrom watched , Thompson 's hand fell casually to the table and filched a pile of money from the man beside him . The other kibitzers noticed , too , and shouted noisy approval , and Thompson went off again into peals of laughter . He seemed just about the happiestman in the world . Watching this scene , Bergstrom was suddenly and sharply disturbed . He stayed a moment longer , then he left the messhall and went up to the yeoman 's office . His friend Braue was alone in there , writing a letter . Bergstrom shut the door and sat down . Have you seen Thompson since he got back ? ' he began . Braue scrawled a few more lines on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . He did n't do any good over there . They told him it was all up to the Captain . '  |p191Bergstrom  nodded . His brow wrinkled in a frown . You know how he was talking last night ? ' Braue leaned back in his chair and nodded . You know how crazy he was last night ? Ready to go over the hill and everything ? Really pounding his head against the wall ? ' Braue nodded . Bergstrom went on : Really broken up about it , really taking it hard ? ' What about it ? ' Braue asked . Well , ' said Bergstrom , tonight he 's sitting down in the messhall playing Monopoly as though there was n't a thing in the world had happened . Having the time of his life . ' Braue picked up a pencil and studied it minutely . How about that ? ' Bergstrom asked puzzledly . Last night he was batting his head against the wall . Tonight he 's right back in the old groove . What about that : is that right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quiet and thoughtful boy , highly regarded on the ship . He twisted the pencil around in his hand and squinted as though he were examining a diamond . Well , ' he said finally , if you really want to get technical , what the hell can he do ? ' Bergstrom thought that over for a moment , and then he had to admit it was right : what in the hell could he do ?  |p192IT  WAS ABOUT TEN in the morning when Stoltz , the radioman , went around and awakened Mr. Billings , the communication officer . There was a message to the ship for Mr. Billings to break . Billings mumbled and groaned and finally got up . This was an occupationalp193hazard : about once a month the ship would receive a message and he would have to get out of bed to break it . He always did get up , though , because he always got excited at the possibility that the message might be his orders . He got excited now , and when he went up to the radio shack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got more excited . Feverishly he started breaking it and got as far as ' Lieut . Then he stopped to catch his breath . If the next group was jg ' it might be his orders . He went on . The next word was Douglas , and the orders were for Roberts . Back to the States for reassignment . After his first disappointment had passed , Billings decided he was very glad for Roberts . If any officer deserved orders , it was Roberts . Billings typed up the message and ran down to show it to him . He found Roberts at number two hatch , watching while some dunnage was removed from the bottom . Your orders ! ' Billings shouted , and showed him the message . Roberts read it , and then looked up and studied Billings : Are you kidding ? ' he said flatly . No , I ai n't kidding , ' Billings said . This is on the level , Doug ! ' Roberts studied him for a moment longer , then he read the orders again ; and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grinned the widest and most foolish grin Billings had ever seen . He must have stood like that for at least three minutes , not saying a word . Then suddenly , still grinning , he grabbed Billings's overseas cap and flung it over the side . He pounded Billings on the back and started pushing him toward the house . Come on ! ' he said . I 'll buy you a cup of coffee ! ' You had to give the Captain credit , he was unpredictable . As Roberts explained to Billings , he fully expectedthe old bastard to hold him a month or two , just out of spite , before detaching him . Although the orders read that he was to be immediately detached , Roberts had cause to know that the Old Man was not impressed by Bureau directives . The orders of the last officer to get off , Ensign Soucek , had read the same way ; and the Captain had kept him for a full month . Roberts expected at least equal treatment . But the Captain fooled him . Fooled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he read it and sniffed and grunted . He delivered to Billings a brief , ordinary harangue on the subject of Roberts . Then he said with sudden decisiveness : All right , that 's fine ! We 'll get rid of that guy fast . You tell the executive officer to write up his orders and get him off of here tomorrow . Yessir , by God , we 'll get rid of that guy in a hurry ! ' Then the Captain smiled his most gloating , cat-swallows-the-mouse smile . He did n't know it , but he could scarcely have done anythingnicer for Roberts if he had wanted to : which certainlyhe did n't . It was a wonderful day for Roberts . Everything followedwith miraculous precision . Billings had been over on the beach the day before , and coming back he hadp195given a ride to an armed guard officer from a merchant tanker . The officer had mentioned that his ship was sailing straight to San Francisco day after tomorrow . Billings , remarkably , even remembered the name of the ship and with Roberts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had this message signaledover : Can you take one officer passenger back to the States ? ' In a very few minutes the answer came back : Affirmative . Have him aboard by noon tomorrow . ' Straight to the States on a fast merchant ship , the most comfortable transportation possible . It was a wonderfulday for Roberts . Before he could change his mind , the Captain signed the orders detaching him , and Mr. LeSueur , the executive officer , promised him a boat any time in the morning that he wanted it . Roberts spent the afternoon packing . By virtue of the circumstances that normally odious process became a very happy one . Roberts had a fine time throwing the accumulated non-essentials and undesirables of twoand-a-half-years ' living into a mounting pile in the corner . He was aided by  --  or at any rate he had for company  --  Ensign Pulver . Pulver was considerably depressed by the news , and he lay in Roberts 's bunk , propped on one elbow , and made lugubrious conversation . Finally the combination of a soft bunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep . By dinnertime Roberts was all packed , and the pile in the corner was mountainous . Dinner that evening was quite an exciting meal for all the officers . It was a genuine event when any officer got orders , but when that officer was Roberts it was really so . It was a noisy dinner . Every officer in the wardroom shouted bawdy admonitions at Roberts . If he was asked once , he was asked twenty times : What 's going to be the second thing you do when you hit Frisco ? ' Then Jake Bailey , the steward , brought out a big chocolate cake . He had laboriously lettered in white frosting , So long , Mr. Roberts . ' He was grinning sadly as he brought it over for Roberts to cut . After dinner the Doc came over and said offhandedly to Roberts : Drop around after while . ' It was the Doe 's way of announcing that alcohol would be availablein his room that night . It took Roberts a couple of hours to turn over to Carney , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the First Lieutenant . It was eight o'clock before he got around to the Doe 's room . The door was closed and Pulver and Ed Pauley were already there . Ensign Pulver was lying in the Doe 's bunk with a drink balancedon his stomach . The Doc poured a half-inch of grain alcohol in a water glass , filled it halfway from a can of orange juice , and handed the drink to Roberts . Sit down , ' he said . This was not the first time that the four had gathered there , and it was not the thirty-first . In a period of one year this group had consumed an impressive portion of the Doctor 's supply of medicinal grain alcohol . Mixed with any type of fruit juice available in the pantry , it made a nice drink . Indeed , as the Doc was fond of saying , this war would likely produce a whole genera/tion of alcohol and fruit-juice drinkers . These sessions in the Doc 's room were always pleasant . The Doc alwayspresided and he did most of the talking ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful talker and he had wonderful stories to tell . The roles of Roberts and Ed Pauley were those of appreciative listeners and contributing philosophers . Ensign Pulver performed adequately as the foil . These social nights passed easily in thoughtful talk . Sex was perhaps the favorite and certainly the inevitablesubject . Ship 's gossip and personalities , notably the Captain , were another . The great parent organization , the Navy , was frequently examined . These were the staples , but derivative or even extraneous subjects were permitted . Specialties were indulged , and Robertsand the Doc held long private discussions of medicalmatters . Ed Pauley , a fine , droll story-teller , spun an oral saga of life in Oswego , New York . When the conversation had not to do with sex , Ensign Pulver did n't contribute much . The evening started out according to plan . At first there was polite discussion of Roberts 's orders . There was speculation as to how much time in the States he would get , and after that , what type of duty he would draw . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride straight back to Frisco . Then , very skillfully , Ed Pauley transferred the talk to sex . The transition was smooth . Doug , ' he said to Roberts , do you rape easily ? Becausefrom what I read about the States , you 'll prob/ably be attacked in the middle of Market Street by one of those predatory American women . ' This provoked a long and thoughtful discussion of the mores and morals of American womanhood . All in all , it consumed a period of three drinks . It was ground that had been covered before , but on which the definitive word had not yet been said . The talk was almost scholarly . Regional differences in the sexual habits and aptitudes of women were carefully probed . Ed Pauley did an exhaustive job on the propensities of the girls of Oswego . Ensign Pulver was listened to with the respect due an authority as he offered for contrast the reproductive rhythm of Scranton , Pennsylvania . Lieutenant Roberts spoke briefly but searchingly of the peculiarities of the Middle West in general , and Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it remained for the Doc to attempt the definitive word . We are embarking , ' he hypothesized , on a new and revolutionary era in the history of sex . In quite a literal sense , women during this war have discovered sex and they have found it a field of human activity which they can dominate . From the traditional role of passivity in sexual relations , they have passed beyond partnership into aggressiveness . From now on , women will be the aggressors in the sex act . Sometime early next year , and probably in San Francisco , we will read of the first criminal assault of a boy by a girl . Soon after that , the matter will become so commonplace it will not be newsworthy . All the assertive functions of courting will be usurped by women ; they will send flowers , buyp199candy , pay for dinners , and in general initiate and controlreproduction in all its manifestations . It is probably , ' the Doc concluded , some sort of a millennium . ' There was a moment of respectful silence when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirsty after the intense discipline of the seminar , the Doctor poured more drinks . The talk relaxed into loose and anecdotal discussion . Ed Pauley mentioned his friend who had rendered the same girl pregnant six times within the space of thirteen months . Pauley offered it as some sort of a record , and the Doc agreed that it very likely was . The Doctor brought up the well-known movie actress whom he had treated for alcoholic nyphomania . Then one of the rituals of their gatherings was acted out . While Ensign Pulver lay in the bunk and grinned hugely , the purity of his fiancee back in Scranton , Pennsylvania , was systematically impugned . Ensign Pulver always enjoyed this part of the evening immensely . He alternately grinned and chuckled while all the probabilitieswere invoked . Tonight Lieutenant Roberts introduced a new twist when he suggested that Pulver could send his girl no nicer nor more appropriate Christmas gift than a chastity belt . He further suggested that the carpenter shop could make a very fine one . Pauley and the Doc concurred heartily , and Ensign Pulver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not appeared , the evening would perhapshave gone on like that , deep in its routine , and ended in comparative tranquility . If Dowdy had not appeared , perhaps the Doctor would have remained merely pensively philosophical . Perhaps : although these things are by no means certain . It could be persuasivelyargued that the imminent departure of LieutenantRoberts was too shocking a mutation for the ship to absorb without a brief , compensatory period of chaos . Or it could be more baldly argued that certain factions of the ship 's company were simply ready for a good bender . At any rate , Dowdy did appear , and the evening did attain to a certain violence ; and the Doctor did , to a certain extent , go berserk . As a drunk the Doc was of the unpredictable sort . Up to a certain point he was disciplined if loquacious . Beyond that point the Doc got pretty primitive . There was the time at an officers ' club at one of the islands when he tried to do battle with a four-striper . Sillylooking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was not only twice his rank but twice his size as well . If he had not been also twice as drunk , the Doctor would undoubtedly have been a candidate for PortsmouthNaval Prison . That was one time , and there had been several others . It was after ten o'clock when Dowdy knocked on the door . He stood sober and purposeful in the doorway . Hear you 're leaving us ? ' he addressed Roberts . When this was confirmed , he went on : Well , a few of us are having a little party down in the armory and they said for me to ask you down to have a drink with us . That 's all of you , naturally , ' he added . Roberts questioned the Doc with a look . Sure thing , ' said the Doc expansively . Hell , yes , we 'll have a drink . But first you have one with us. '  |p201Dowdy  did that , and he did better than that : he had two . Then the Doc said : We might as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quart of alcohol , now reduced to less than a pint , stuck it under his shirt , and then , in single file , the Doc leading , Ensign Pulver trailing , the group repaired to the armory . They met a noisy reception . The new party was already in an advanced state . The armory was not a large room and now it was crowded . There was Olson , of course , and there was Stefanowski , of course . Kalinka , the shipfitter , and Vanessi , the storekeeper , were sitting on the workbench . The two gunner 's mates , Wiley and Schaffer , were leaning on the rifle rack . Denowsky was not fixed but mobile , wandering up and down . The large ten-gallon crock sat on the deck in almost the geometrical center of the room . Right away the Doc made a perfect gesture , one that symbolically and in fact wedded the two groups . He pulled out the bottle of alcohol , flourished it and emptied its contents into the crock . The cheers were almost deafening . Dowdy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the amalgamated alcohol and jungle juice for the newcomers . This here is a brand-new batch , ' he explained to them . It turned out pretty good . The last batch we made , there was something the matter with it . I guess we let it set too long  --  it had kind of a green crust on top . Wiley there drank some and he peed green the next day . What do you suppose caused that , Doc ? '  | ' Oh , some kind of a fungus growth in the bladder , ' the Doc said airily . This is good stuff . ' Yeah , ' said Dowdy . Anyway , I give that last batch away to the engineers . It did n't look good to me , and you ca n't hurt an engineer ! Then the toasts began . Stefanowski made the first , and , considering the occasion , it was just about perfect . Although he stood a little unsteadily , his words were firm and brave : Now , by God , this drink is for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roberts . And that ai n't saying nothing against the rest of you officers because I think we got a good bunch of officers on this ship  --  ' Stefanowski paused and qualified : Except for that shithead of a Captain  --  and I think we got the best of the lot here tonight . But , by God , I say , and I bet you other officers agree with me , that Mister Roberts is absolutely the tops , and I 'm sure sorry to see him go , and , by God , I think we ought to drink to him ! ' It is hard to see how it could have been more nicely put , and Stefanowski 's toast was promptly and noisily executed . There were many others . The toast idea caught the fancy of the party , and the level of the improved jungle juice went down markedly in the crock . After all presenthad been honored , toasts were drunk to , among others : Bela Kun , Chili Williams , the Captain 's early demise , Girls Who Wore Black Pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No Pants , Cordell Hull , Winnie Ruth Judd , Boo-Boo Hoff , and Marjorie Ann Lundberg , of Coffeyville , Kansas . These necessarilyp203took a long time , though not as long as you might expect , and in the course of them Dowdy sidled over to Lieutenant Roberts . Say , ' he said secretively , Tom Olson 's got a good idea . He says we ought to take care of the Old Man 's palm trees tonight . You know the Old Man 's got that watch up there now , but Olson says that Red McLaughlinwent on at midnight , and hell , if he did , he 's asleep by now . Hell , it 's twelve-fifteen , and you know Red McLaughlin . So maybe if you and me and Olson sort of sneak up there now .. The thing was done with style . Dowdy was right : Red McLaughlin was asleep , propped against the Captain'sbulkhead . The two palm trees were removed from their five-gallon cans and dumped over the side . Red McLaughlin was sleeping with both arms outstretchedand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Olson did everything  --  they insisted it was their turn . Roberts 's role was that of honored observer , and when they finished , he complimented the boys on a thoroughly professional job . The evening should have ended there . Right then and there it was a success . It had form. , and accomplishment , and a nice feeling . Unfortunately the others in the armory had not this sense of structure and of proportion . Dowdy and Olson and Lieutenant Roberts were n't absent very long on their mission , but when they returned to the party , they found it noticeably deteriorated.  | A bitter argument was going on . Denowsky stood accused of urinating in the crock of jungle juice . Everyonewas standing around the crock and Schaffer was holding Wiley , who was making spasmodic attempts to swing at Denowsky . Everyone was shouting . It was a bad moment , and the Doctor 's intervention was welltimed . Quiet ! ' he yelled until he finally got it . Then , very pompously , he announced that he would make a test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He dipped one into the jungle juice and filled it . Then he looked around and on the workbench he spotted a bottle of ink . He emptied this into the other glass . He held the two glasses up and alternately poured one into the other , as though preparing a bromo-seltzer . Then , in his best scientific manner , one eye screwed shut and his face impartial , he held the glasses up to the light . He had almost breathless attention as he studied them . Finally he put down the glasses and made a gesture like a baseball umpire signaling a runner safe . It 's okay , ' he announced authoritatively ; the test is nega-tive . ' The decision was greeted with cheers ; the acquitted man Denowsky was pounded on the back , and Wiley , released from restraint , promptly made another lunge at him . Finally Wiley was placated and the party resumed . It grew in size and in volume . It was depleted by one when Vanessi passed out quietly and was removedto the passageway , but then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the signalman , and Ringgold , and two other first division men.  |p205It  was no longer possible to move from one end of the armory to the other . The party divided into several autonomous groups . One , with Wiley and Schaffer , sat on the deck in a corner and sang a new set of lyrics to On , Wisconsin . ' The new lyrics consisted solely of a popular and colloquial four-letter verb or noun chanted over and over . Kalinka was the center of the little group in the opposite corner . Kalinka had been demonstratingthe process of placing one 's leg behind one 's head ; now his leg was locked behind his head and he could n't get it down . It did n't seem to bother him , though ; and in truth he did n't seem aware of it . He just sat on the deck and talked with a drink in his hand . A third group gathered around the Doctor and tried to convince him that they were deserving cases for medicaldischarge . It was about this time the Doc decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed more alcohol and he said he knew where there was some if Olson could get him a hack-saw . Olson managed that right away , and the Doc said , Come on ! ' Wiley went along and very furtively the three went to the medical storeroomand with much sweating effort sawed away the hinge of the lock . With a high sense of achievement they removed another quart . The Doc had the keys in his pocket , but he had evidently forgotten this . Only an equal forgetfulness on the part of the other two , or a rare sense of honor , saved the vulnerable alcohol locker from further and serious depletion that night . Ringgold was the first casualty . Stefanowski had **32;1510;TOOLONG brought his band hack across the plains , heading for shelter from the blizzard in the strange tortured hill formations of the Buttes . Thunderhead 's band now numbered fourteen . There were ten mares and three colts aged two or three months . The colts belonged to three of the . mares he had brought from the valley with him , a bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Hagar . " These mares had also had yearlings , but when the new foals came Thundad had driven the yearlings out of the band . It is the common law of horsedom that when a mare drops a foal the yearling running at her side must be banished . One is enough for her to nurse and care for . The stallion secs to it and drives them away . At first they try desperately to get back and the strugglecontinues for days . They can not conceive of life , separated from their duns . Eventually , bitten and bleeding and scarred , they accept their first serious defeat and stand at a distance in woebegonepostures with heads hanging , eyes turned wistfully back toward the herd . But soon comes consolation , for they band together in their affliction . Often permanent attachments are formed . They learn a new and independent way of life , find their own food and shelter , and glorious fun begins . But Hagar 's yearling , who was the Albino 's only white colt , could not adjust himself to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his white coat and his magnificent conformation , the same stubbornness and wilfulness that had characterized his sire . Thunderhead had driven him away with the other yearlings , but he returned and clung to the mares as close as he dared , half a mile or so away . So he truly deserved the name Ken had given him , Ishmael , driven out of his own band and yet without the companionshipof any other . Now and then Thunderhead made a sortie to drive him farther off and , if he could catch up with him , punish him for his presumption . Then would Ishmael 's long slim white legs  --  as strong as Thunderhead 's own  --  take him floating off over the prairie to a safer distance , and Thunderhead would return to his duties. pIOIThunderhead 's lead mare was a dry , a rangy black named Lady Godiva who had once belonged to the owner of the Steamboat Springs daily paper . There were the two handsome brown Morgan mares which Thunderhead had stolen from Jeff Stevens . These were also dry . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where , not fully grown , one a pale honey color , one a warm russet , quite chunky . Evidently they had Palomino blood in them . These would have their first foals the following spring . There was Jenny , Daly 's mare . And there was Jewel . Jewel alone of all the band had no warm coat of fur . Her hair was short , close , glossy from much graining , and her hide was thin . She had never experienced snow , let alone a blizzard . All her winternights had been spent in her comfortable box stall in the Beckwithstables . During the mild spring and summer and fall nights she had browsed and drowsed in one of the small fenced pastures . She had never had to fight against a stiff wind . Now she was beaten upon by a blinding white blizzard that bewildered her , burned her eyes , and struck its fingers of ice into the very marrow of her bones . Already , within her , the supernaturally intelligent mechanism of her body was hastening to repair the deficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little time . In a week the lengthening hair would be visible . Meanwhile , she was an object of half-frozen miseryif she ceased moving even for a moment . But Thunderhead kept them all moving . He was sometimes ahead , leading them , sometimes behind , driving them . To Jewel he was as much a part of the horror as the cold . She veered away from him when he was near her . She had several sore spots in her haunches that would be bleeding now were it not that they were frozen . Occasionallyshe felt that the stallion was the whole trouble . If she could only get away from him and these mares all the other troubles would vanish too and she might find herself in the padded crate warm and snug again with Collins ' familiar voice coming to her , his firm , accustomed hands smoothing her neck , tying the bag of oats on her head , petting her while the stream of delicious heat and strength poured down her gullet and gradually filled her with new life . Yes  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , with this idea , she broke away from the herd and dashed off at an angle . But fast as she was , Thunderhead was faster , and in a momentpIO2 she would be screaming with terror of the white monster behind her who drove his cruel teeth into her rump . More sore places now . More even than his teeth she feared himself and would swing away from him and find then that he had calculated on that , and that she was once again in the band of mares , going along obediently with them . But there was no peace for her with the mares either . One and all of them bit at her , shouldered her , swung their haunches and kicked her . So she ran out to one side of the band and galloped there alone . Jenny was being hared , no . Newcomers in a hand of horses arc always persecuted exactly like the new children at school . ' I " he newcomer has to prove himself and win his way . At last he is accepted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I he three foals ran close under the sides of their dams , as well able , in spite of the short time they had been on the earth , to bear up under the cold and wind as their darns ; perhaps better , because the mares hail to rustle for their feed . A colt need only to thrust its nose under its dam 's belly if she should pause for so much as a half minute . Moreover , food came warmed exactly to the colt 's needs , whereas the mare had to paw up the snow and cat the dry cold grass beneath it . Long icicles hung from their nostrils and lips , their bodies were encrusted with white , only the manes and tails were dark . These , moving constantly in the wind , were kept free from snow . Suddenly the wind seemed to drop . Thunderhead slackened speed , rite hand stopped running and stood grouped in the lee of a high ridge of ground , one of the Buttes . Here was shelter . This was what Thunderhead had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mares were thirsty and ate the snow . Thunderheadhimself pawed the snow and disclosed , under the cliff , a good-sired patch of green buffalo grass , sub-irrigated . The mares crowded to it and ate ravenously .. Jewel tried to do the same , but the mares kicked her out . Frightened and forlorn , she moved to a safer distance and stood there , taut and humped in the icy wind and snow that curled over the peak of the ridge and just caught her where she was . But she dared not return . To freeze was better than to be kicked and bitten. ' lhc night wore on . Vitality died down in Jewel . Her legs didpI03not hold her up very well but seemed to bend . Her head hung very low . The scent came to her on one of the currents of wind that whirled around the ridge . It was a warm scent , a horse scent , and a friendly scent . Oh , better than that ! It was the scent of a champion , a refuge , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monster with the brown eyes and the heavy , black forelock . It was the scent of Pete ! Jewel raised her head as if she had received new life . A wild nicker of recognition burst from her . Every mart and the stallion , too , turned and looked . Something off there in the whiteness ! A huge , bulky shape standing , a little timid , a little humble in the presence of the stallion as every gelded creature must be timid and humble in the presence of the unaltered male . Jewel fled toward him and in spite of his knowledge of the danger an answering whinny rumbled up out of his deep throat . Jewel reached him and flung herself against him . They pressed their faces together , their nostrils touched and clung . f'ete 's deep , tender rumblings continued . At that moment the stallion fell upon him , reared and pawed him , bit him , and whirled to lash out with his murderous heels . But Pete was not there to receive the blow . He had faded off into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from him . Jewel felt a vicious nip on her withers and fled back to the mares . They presented their haunches and kicked her out of the herd . Again she found her cold and lonely place on the outside and took her stand there . A half hour passed . Then again that warm friendly smell of Pete ! Again the irrepressible nicker burst from her and she dashed off to meet him . Again the stallion pursued . Rut this time Pete waited only for one touch of his nostrils to hers , one deep whinny  --  a promise not to desert her  --  then whirled and pounded away , his great hoofs shaking the earth . Jewel went meekly back to her place and Thunderhead returned to his frantic chopping of the buffalo grass with his thick , white teeth , feeding voraciously , needing the nourishment and heat that comes from it to maintain his strength and vigilance and the fire of his stallion-kingliness.  | The next time Jewel smelled Pete she did not whinny nor run out to him . She raised her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looming darkness . He came nearer but not too near , and warily , casually , as it were , began to paw the grass and nose beneath it for food . He did not fool Thunderhead . The stallion 's ears were flattened even though his head still hung low over the grass and he continued to cat , but he was alert to cvcry move Pete made . Then his ears relaxed . He gave over being concerned and concentrated on his feeding . Jew el too began to paw the grass and nose underneath it for food . Her gracing brought her nearer to Pete . He stood in an unsheltered place taking the full force of the wind and snow . Step by step she approached him , at last ceased any pretense of grazing , moved . close and placed herself against his towering bulk as a colt is close under its mother 's side . She felt the heat of his great body and was comforted , l lc did not waver , but stood staunchly , the blizzard beating upon his windward side and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Jewel was encrusted gradually melted and dripped off . The heat from the gelding 's body penetrated her own . It was delicious . She was safe . She began to drowse . Hours passed . The prairie wolves were out seeking for victims of the blizzard . Now and then their long-drawn , mournful howls were carried on the wind to the horses , but they were not near , the stallion did not even raise his head . Not quite so brave were the little yearlings who were seeing their first blizzard out , alone , sheltered under the Ice of an overhanging cliff four miles to the north . They swung their heads nervously as the howls drifted to them , joined in sinister dissonance to the whine of the wind . They strained their ears to hear , held themselves taut and trembling . A half mile away a solitary horse shape , the young Ishmael , stood motionless by a sheltering hill . He was shrouded in ice and snow , as white as his own hair and hide . His head was turned toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening for the sound of I ! agar 's voice . And so he stood while the night passed . Jewel did not cease to cling to Pete . And he leaned his great head , his rough black mane streaming over her.  |p105CROWN  JEWEL might not have survived that first blizzard had it not been for Pete . In all the storms of the hard winter which she spent with Thunderhead 's band on the plains between the Buttes and the Snowy Range , Pete was her protector . As soon as the first blizzard had ended and also the terrible ground blizzard which followed it , Thunderhead led them south into the open . Here , ground would be bare of snow because of the wind which incessantly swept it . There would be grass , dry and brown but extremely nourishing . There would be shelter enough and water enough in the little draws and depressions of the plains . Elk and antelope and deer were on these plains for the same reason . Jewel was a comical picture of surprise when she first lifted her head from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group of these strangely shaped animals sharing her pasture . But it soon came to be a natural and a pleasant thing . Occasionally , moved by irrepressiblecuriosity , she approached them tentatively . Sometimes , equally curious , they would come hesitantly to meet her and stand at a little distance , staring , stamp a hoof nervously , whirl away , run for a few seconds , then calm down and begin grazing again . Sometimes the deer and horses grazed together , paying no attention to each other . On winter days of true Wyoming gloriousness , when the sun , in a cloudless sky of deepest blue , blazed down through crystal air and poured its heat and energy into the hone , like charges of electricity , Jewel was almost bereft of her senses with excitement and happiness . Nothing like this had ever been known by her before . She frolicked like a yearling . She bucked and frisked and tossed her head , stood on her hind legs and pawed at nothing . The little group of yearlings a few miles away could easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to make friends with them . Thunderhead , without even lifting his head kept an eye on all they did . Jewel returned . She always returned now . She had learned her lessons and got no more bites in her haunches . Shep106no longer feared Thunderhead except for a seemly attention to his wishes . Once she found herself grazing close beside him . They moved slowly , almost keeping step , their sharp teeth jerking left , then right , another step , and with a full mouth , the stallion raised his head high tossing his eves in a wide circle , a glance which took in every moving thing within a radius of many miles . All 's well  --  and he lowered his head and again went step by step along with Jewel , their muzzles almost touching . He was not greedy . He willingly left her the good tuft of grass they were approaching . She came to feel a confidence in him . Sltc knew that when he watched and stood guard , he stood guard for the whole herd . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herd but accompanied it wherever it went , remaining always at the respectful distance of a few hundred yards . Most of the time Jewel was with him . ' Thunderhead had now accepted this friendship . In wintertime , when the mar es arc with foal , there is not so much to fear from an intruder . Besides , Pete was a gelding and not young , either . It is the young stallions a herd leader fears . So the formation of horses was like a constellation , Thunderhead the central sun with the mares his close satellites , Pete and Jewel moving on an outer circle , Ishmael all alone on another ring , the yearlings on the farthest ring of all . Still farther , but out of sight of this band , were other groups of honer , many of them the inbred small " wild " horses which are to he found in all the mountain states . But the centripetal force emanatingfrom Thunderhead and binding his constellation together did not reach to these others and they ranged free of his control . Jewel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had before . Her lungs deepened and gained in power . She grew taller , longer ' card . The luxuriant growth of her mane and tail and her thick fur made her look , at first glance , like a wild horse of the plain , hut at second glance , there was that superb head of anEnglish thoroughbred , the fine sensitive ears , and four most perfect black legs . ' flue only white mark upon her was the diamond and pendant upon her forehead. ' 1 he winter was long . The mares grew thin , their bellies were low , there was a sag in their backbones . The storms continued with lengthening periods of good grazingp107weather between . Sometimes there was a day when the air was balmy . As spring approached the snow melted quickly after storms . Thunderhead changed his pasture constantly . He was approaching the foothills of the Snowy Range , country that was new to him . He investigated every rock , every hill , every little hollow , really surveying the land like an engineer , so that when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he knew where to take them . If they had to be concealed , he knew draws in which they could be invisible to anything moving on the plains . He spotted each rise where he could stand and see the country for miles around . Wherever he went , his entire constellation went with him until one day when Jewel , looking for the yearlings , could not see them . They had drifted away to a farther range . The bond between them and the mother-herd was cut . But Ishmael , now a magnificent two-year-old , still clung to his orbit , still stood at night with his head turned and his ears pricked toward Thunderhead 's band . Thunderhead eyed him with increasing disfavor . This could not be tolerated much longer . But Ishmael was fast on his feet , and Thunderhead knew it . With the approach of spring , Thunderhead 's temper became short . Stallions would soon be roaming . Spring would put wanderlustinto their feet . They would be looking for mares . Sex was awakening in hint and brought its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was as if through the sexless wintertime , he had enjoyed a period of peace , his care of his herd having a quality of father-love and protection . Now he watched ceaselessly for rivals , for the scent of a mare to be found and bred and appropriated , for someone to pick a fight with . He trotted around his mares , erect from his springy hoofs to his high , sharply pricked ears and uplifted tail . Savagely he drove the colts out of his herd . These were yearlings now . The forlorn youngsters went through the usual period of agony before they accepted defeat and formed their own little band a few miles from the mother-herd . For hours at a time , Thunderhead stood on his high point of vantage , looking for trouble . No challenger came , but there was still Ishmael . One day Thunderhead 's anger crystalized . He shot out of the herd , a bolt of fury aimed at the white two-year-old . This time hep108would have his way and punish the youngster so he would never return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was off and a mile away before Thunderhead reached the spot where he had been . From that day on Ishmael no longer clung close to the motherherdbut neither did he join the band of his fellows , nor any other band . He found a new range for himself , a range which had a high peak from which he could sec ' T'hunderhead 's band of mares . If the wind were right , he could smell them ; now and then , he could get the whiff , or at least the sense , of his dam . This was all of life for him . Here he was safe from Thunderhead , could watch , move as they moved , keep his distance , vet have them within sight . There cane a day when Thunderhead , incessantly on the lookoutand shilling the messages brought on the wind , got notice of some mares in the neighborhood , one newly foaled , open . He left his hand and trotted away , his high-held muzzle undulating from side to side , playing with the scent , feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his feet stepped high . When he returned with two mares , one with a foal at foot , Hagar had vanished . Well he knew what had happened . In his absence , Ishmael had swooped down on the herd and stolen his mother . ' T'hunderhead 's nose made a careful survey of Ishmael 's hoof prints and of Hagar 's . He pawed at these . Furious snorts rippled from his nostrils . He came upon a pile of dung . It still smoked . Thunderheadmoved a step or two forward and covered it with his own . Then , following the scent with his nose , he went in pursuit . When he came upon them he went first for the mare . A few vicious chops separated her from her son and turned her backward . Then Thunderhead snorted his challenge to Ishmael . Ishmael stood up to him and faced him bravely , twenty feet or so away . Thunderheadpawed the earth , raking up clouds of dust , Ishmael did the sane . His proud young crest lifted , his chin was dragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never fought before . When Thunderheadlifted a foot and took a step forward , Ishmael did likewise . They neared each other slowly , deliberately , the breath coming loudly through the flaring nostrils of their drawn-in muzzles . Just as they were about to touch heads , Ishmael swerved , reared , wheeled ; and , as Thunderhead faced about and lashed with his heels , the young stallion fled away . Even as Thunderhead , when a year-P109ling , had fled from the Albino , now Ishmael fled from Thunderhead . Not yet could he engage such a warrior . Thunderhead pursued him . The two horses flew over the plains on wings . Was Ishmael the faster ? Or was Thunderhead halfhearted in the pursuit ? The distance between them grew wider , at last Thunderhead turned in a short circle , abandoned the pursuit , headed for Hagar who was nibblingat the grass as if she had never had such a thought as an elopementin her head . Reaching her , Thunderhead gave her a few mean chops which put her into a gallop , then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the band of mares , the two " new girls " were already being hazed by the other mares . Jenny , and Jewel did their part .   AT LAST the mares began shed their winter coats and drop their foals . To make sweet , nourishing milk , high in protein content , they needed grass  --  fresh , voting grass , green and luscious and tender and new . Tiles . needed an abundance of it . It showed first as a soft tint on the southern slopes , then deepened until it was like emerald velvet . It covered the world . The history of the state of Wyoming is the history of its grass . First the buffaloes had it and the Indians and the wild mustangs . Before Wyoming was a state there had come to it large numbers of English and Scottish younger sons to make their fortunes . And they made not only fortunes but a most picturesque period of history . There were hunts , with the coyote and timber wolf taking the place of the red fox . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Normandy and the Cosmopolitan , where fine old British names were spoken across thc bars . There were handsome homes on the great ranches and much visiting back and forth in huge coaches drawn by four or six horses . There was afternoon tea drunk out of beautiful old china , there were heavy English puddings on the dinner tables . At Yuletide , clear , sweet English tenors sang the Carols ; sang , as often as not , on horseback . And from that custom , to this day , the cowboy Carol singers ride out on Christmas Eve , breaking the silence of the frozen plains between ranch and ranch with the joyful ringing of the hoofs of their galloping horses ; and , arriving at some sprawling huddle of dark walls and snow-laden roofs , announce in " close harmony " that , ! lark ! the herald angels are singing , and that , Oh , little town of Bethlehem , the hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight . There were no fences in those days , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their thundering herds of beef upon it . Red Hereford cattle , with their distinguishing mark of the white face , GREEN GRASS OF WYOMING I l lP111were imported from England and became the standard beef cattle of the United States . When sheep were introduced , there was enmity between those who ran beef and those who ran sheep . The cattle were there first . The sheep nosed in . " Firemouths , " they were called , from the way they nibbled the range close . In spite of many and bloody conflicts between beef owners and sheep owners the sheep were there to stay . It was finally understood that they did not spoil the range for beef , they ate a different grass . They liked sage and gamma grass , not the native hay or buffalo grass which was the preferred feed for beef cattle . Eventually there came to Wyoming the dry farmer with ploughs and fences . For a few years these dry farms existed as a camel lives off its hump , feeding on the accumulations of moisture that the green grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut and divided the sod , turning the roots up to the sun . The usual periodical drouths were more severe . Dry winds swept the plateau country and there was nothing to resist them . Moisture went out of the soil , springs and streams vanished , rivers became trickles . The range dried up and blew away . The dry farmers starved . They packed their families and beds and stoves and pots and pans and mattresses in and on the tops and sides of their rusty , ramshackle lords , and fled from the murder they had committed , joining the processions of dustbowl refugees that rattled along the highways of the country . The whole story was told by the gaping , windowless walls , the sagging roofs , the banging shutters of the abandoned farms . Weather beat them into insensibility . They yielded themselves to the tumbleweeds and the tin cans . The general calamity threatened to engulf the stockman as well as the farmer . Hundreds of thousands of cattle were slaughtered to leave more of the dried grass for the few that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal and state governments and certain public-spirited citizens in reserving almost one-third of the state of Wyoming for national forests , the watersheds of the United States were protected from the ignorance and rapacity of man . There was still grass in the mountains . And the surviving herds were trailed higher and higher , following the receding snows . II2 GREEN GRASS OF WYOMINGP112The lakes , mountains , snow-covered peaks , dense forests of the national reserves saved the remnants of the herds . The eternal threat and seduction of the desert , which had almost had its way with the grasslands , could not creep beyond the foothills . The lesson was learned . Grass ! Oh , for grass again ! A country halfway between tillable farm land and desert is cattle land . Heal the ugly scars by planting grass seed on the ploughed fields . Coax the prairie to put an end to the dust storms by creeping back over the gaping earth and Living over it a luscious cover of greensward . Give it to the cattle and sheep and horses who enrich it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , when spring comes in Wyoming , the children in school ask each other . " ! lave you got green grass yet ? We have ! " And there are jubilant answers , " We have ! We have , too . " It is an event . Newspapers publish it . The whole tempo of life and business throughout the state changes . Now the mortgage can be lifted or a new one procured . Grandmother gets out of bed . Children get well of their winter ailments . Old quarrels are forgottenand forgiven , new ones start . On the range , every living thing , small and large , knows that the world is new again . Clouds of bluebirds swing over the land , migratingto their northern summer homes . Rabbits and ermine change their winter coats of white to fawn and amber . The little lambs frolic in clusters and make abrupt jackknife dives into the air . The fleet wild mares of the plains gallop with loose jointed , gangling foals beside them . The slow-moving Hereford cows drop their chunky white-faced calves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world is filled with faint innocent bleatings and cries and moos and whinnys the like of which has not been heard for a year on the plains or in the mountains . The grass thickens and lengthens until it is a lush green lawn of unbelievably vivid color as far as the eye can see . There are patches of pink and blue and lavender made by the forget-me-nots , mariposa bibles , bluebells , larkspur , delphinium . Over all , the heavens deepen into cobalt and are cupped like a bowl . The big , sculptured , white ships of thc sky take shape far off in unseen caves , come drifting up from the western horizon , sail slowly across and slide down the eastcrnslopes . The heavens are patterned with them from north toP113south and east to west , . and the soft wind blowing steadily , but sweet-tempered now and smiling , keeps them ever a-moving . The clouds cast their shadows upon the prairies , mysterious pools of amethyst color . They wander , they drift slowly eastward , their shapes are distinct and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are grazing side by side , two red Hereford cows , one inside the edge of the shadow , one outside . The one within is dark and cool looking , the one outside is brilliant and bright , its hide flashing with glints of fiery color . There is a windmill upon the horizon , squat brown shape , with sturdy arms that wave and posture against the sky . There is nectar in the cool , steady wind  --  nectar of sage from the hillsides , of wildflowers from the gulches , of snow from the mountains , and of miles upon miles of young greengrass . The great mountain ranges , the Neversummer Range in the southwest , the Snowy Range in the west , the Buckhorn Range in the south , are still snow covered ; the peaks , rearing up , are still as dazzlingwhite as the clouds they touch noses with , but the snow line is higher . Here and there a bare , brown ridge runs clear to the top . They are far away , ringing the world . Thunderhead often stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those far mountain peaks , aware of all the life that moved , openly or hidden , between himself and them . he wanted inure mares . For a young and kingly stallion his hand was short . Occasionallyhe made a foray and captured another , and once again men began to talk of him and look for him and to pass the word if anyonecaught a glimpse of him . And so the news came to the Goose Bar that the stallion was somewhere near the border of Wyoming and Colorado . Rob McLaughlinsent Buck Daly out scouring , and a week later wrote Beaver Greenway that Buck had picked up the trail in Fox Park and was following it south . P114IT WAS SATURDAY , the twelfth of June . Ken McLaughlin was out on the Saddle Back filling his eyes and his nostrils and his lungs and his heart with sky and plains and wind and grass . On the peak of a ridge they stood in silent companionship , the tall , thin , seventeen-year-old boy and his mare , Flicka . He had dismountedand was leaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last fifteen minutes . They were just looking around . The look reached to the rampart of snow-covered mountains across the state holder fifty miles south ; and to the gilded dome of the State Capitol building thirty miles east and two thousand feet down ; and to the long , level , sun-blinded plains to the west , pathway ' of the prevailing winds . All this he had seen since he had been born , every summer when he came home from school , and in the winter vacations . Never did he come back to the ranch after the long wintcr 's schooling without going through a strange state of consciousness , blissful but dislo , cated , unable to find his place . The young do not know that this sense of strangeness is a universalfeeling . It wears off . They think , almost with despair , that they have come to the end and their misery will be forever . Flicka turned her head and pricked her cars . Ken heard the faraway thunder of hoofs and looked alertly in every direction , until Flicka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south , gave him the cue . Concentrating on it , he saw the little " pecks , like ants , running along the crest . Just a bunch of wild brunt's. he would not have seen them , but for Flicka . He realized , this morning , he had not really been looking . As a small boy Ken had been an addict to daydreaming , one of those children who , when they are preoccupied with their thoughts , can walk through their days seeing nothing , knowing nothing of what is going on . In fact , the filly , Flicka , had been given to him in the hope that her reality would overcome his love of the unreal . P115And it had . Ken could be wide awake enough now when he wanted to , but he could still dream . Today he had just been dreaming . There were two ways you could look at things . One way , you really saw nothing at all , because you looked at it as one whole thing and just drifted away into it and forgot everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at everything separately and then it came to life . Now he looked around and took it apart . The stones turned into squat grey bunnies almost underfoot . Those nubbly points on top of rocks were whistling pigs standing on their hind legs and looking searchingly out of little , old men 's faces . Those big tufts on the wild currant bush were two hawks watching for gopher . The twist on the top of the trunk of the big pine was an eagle . All this was familiar . All this was home . In his looking and searching , there was also the wonder of what was not yet to be seen but might show up at any moment . The sheep , for instance . There was not a sign of them . His father had given him a message to deliver to Jeremy , the sheepherder , camping near Section Twenty-seven water hole . Ken searched the hill above the water hole some miles to the east , but it was bare of life . His eyes wandered away again , losing their focus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overhead aroused him , the steady , distant drone of an airplane . He searched the deep skies . They were partly obscured by processions of clouds on their slow way across the zenith h . He found no plane , only a hawk that wheeled with a harsh , sad cry , and the lovely iridescent broken-off piece of a rainbow , hanging inexplicablyin clear blue . Left behind , he thought , from the last storm . He counted the colors . Pink and mauve and gold and green . Then an exciting smell made him turn . It was the metallic smell of rain and of dust on the wind . Down southeast a storm was boilingup . The tangle of blue-black thunderheads seemed on a level with him . Lightning split the blackness again and again , and he could see the clouds colliding and wrestling with each other , and curtains of rain falling . It was not coming toward him . Up here in the sun , with the gentle breeze and the drifting clouds and the hanging ribbon of rainbow , it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Again he turned his eyes to theP116barren hill above the water hole and in spite of its apparent emptinesshe kept on looking . There were two small black bushes on the hillside near the top . Suddenly they moved . One made a dash . They were sheep dogs . Then it looked as if a wave of grey water washed over the hill and rippled down . The sheep . Three thousand . of them . The whole band . He mounted Flicka and rode slowly toward the water hole . Jeremy , hungry , as all sheepherders arc , for a breath of the outside world , was standing out in front of his wagon , eagerly awaiting his visitor . Greetings were exchanged as Ken dismounted and threw the reins over Flicka 's head . Jeremy 's eyes went to the saddle upon which several packages were fastened . " Did yec bring me any magazines , Ken ? " " Sure . And sonic candy and a couple of records . " Ken took the bundle off Flicka 's saddle and handed it to Jeremy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff . This one 's a Western . " The herder took the two records in his hands and looked at the writing . " The Western , " said Ken , pointing , " it 's about  --  all this . " He swung his arm wide . " All what ? " " The grass . The greengrass . See the title ? Green Grass of Wyoming . " Jeremy read the title slowly aloud and stood thoughtfully looking at it while Ken , stretching himself , gazed around with his far , dreaminggaze . " Must have been a guy that saw all this  --  the greengrass , and so much of it  --  and wrote that song about it . " " Grass is awful plain stuff to write poetry and music about , " said Jeremy thoughtfully . " Still and all , come to think about it , we live on it . " " Not us , " corrected Ken . " The animals do . " " Well , the beef eats the grass and we eat the beef . " Ken laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I know why he wrote about the grass . " Jeremy looked up . " It kind of  --  gets you , " Ken explained . " I always feel that way when I 've been off at school and then come back . It 's so awfully big , so awfully different from anything else in the world  --  and yet , it 's  --  just grass . " " Wait while I play it , " said Jeremy and went into the sheepwagonand put the western song on his little phonograph . Kenstood outside listening . " Oh ! It 's the green grass ! On the hills , in the spring , that keeps me a-roaming , Ridin ' all day on the prairie , On the green grass rolling range of Wyoming . Lonely plains , Wide and stillOn the skylineAn old windmill ! Oh ! It 's the galloping hoofsOn the green grass rolling range of Wyoming . " Oh ! It 's the west wind ! It 's the wind that sweeps the grass of Wyoming , Scented with snow from the mountainsAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Winter 's done ! And I 'm trailin ' The settin ' sun . Oh ! It 's the galloping hoofsOn the green grass rolling range of Wyoming ! " . " You can keep it if you like , " said Ken as Jeremy shut off the phonograph and came to stand beside him . " You can give it hack tome when you come down for the shearing . " " There 's gon na be a good clip , " said Jeremy seating himself on one of the steps of his wagon and taking out his pipe . " Any news down at your place ? " Ken threw himself full length on the grass . " Well , I came up to tell you , " said he , " that Dad 's got Garcia and his men for the shearing . It 'll be about in two weeks . He wants you to keep the sheep where they are until then if there 's feed enough . " Jeremy took a deep pull at his pipe . " There 's plenty grass here yet  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too ? "  --  Copyright , 1946 , by Sam Fox Publishing Co. , New York , N. Y. Used by epecial Permission . PII8 " Sure . Say  --  did you know Howard passed his exams and is ordered to report at West Point on the Fourth of July ? " " That ai n't no news ! He took them exams last January . He got the notice he had passed in April , the wire to your Dad came through the telegraph agent over to Tie Siding , an ' he spread the news  --  I bet I had it afore your Dad did . And I kin tell you somepin ' else too . Your Dad went into Cheyenne and painted the town red . Waal , he ended up at the Post , and the Army officers give him a dinner of congratulation , and they did say your Dad got tight as a tick . But , say ! Who 'd blame him ? Sixteen thousand dollars ! That ai n't a minnow  --  that 's It good big wad of dough . " " Sixteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ givin ' me ? " " Sure . That 's what it takes to put a boy through West Point . Mien Howard passed them exams he put sixteen thousand dollars in your Dad 's pocket , or words to that effect . Say , Ken , any other news down at your place ? " Ken thought hard , then shook his head . " Your baby sister baptized yet ? " " Nope . That 's comin ' off soon , though . I Toward and I are going to be godfathers . " " I heerd yore Maw was set to have it clone last summer an ' yore Paw did n't git around to feelin ' ready for it and yore Maw was real mad . That so , Ken ? " Ken looked a little worried . " Something like that , " he said . " Any other news , Ken ? " Ken shook his head . " What about that Pearl woman ? " There was always news about Pearl . Ken told how she had gone to town for her day off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jail as usual . Told the Sheriff to leave her there for two days more , till she was good and sober , then he 'd come for her . " And I het , " chuckled Jeremy , " the Sheriff was glad to oblige . E  --  yore Maw and Paw did n't keep her here on the ranch the state would have her board and keep to pay at the I louse of Correction . " " Sure , " said Ken . " That 's The luck of it for us . Zowie ! the pies and cookies she makes ! " " Fond of cookies myself , " said Jeremy , smacking his lips . " Did she sober up all right ? "   " Sure . They took her out of jail and put her in Dad 's car and he brought her right to the ranch . " Jeremy chuckled . " Did n't give her no chance to cut loose again . Say ! I wonder how many times your Dad 's done that ! " " Plenty , " said Ken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we 've got company coming . " " Company ? " Jeremy pricked up his ears . Company at any ranch was a good news-item . " Carey Marsh , " said Ken importantly . " Say ! Ai n't that the leetle gal was nearly lost in the blizzard last fall ? " " That 's the one . " " Daughter of Beaver Greenway ? The fellow owns the race track over to Saginaw Falls ? " " Not daughter , grandniece . Mother wrote and asked her to come down to visit us and she 's coming tomorrow . " " And wot about that horse of hers got lost in the Badlands ? The English race horse ? Milt Norcross was over here yestiddy asking me was you going out again this summer to hunt her ? " " Sure we are . And this time we 'll get her . And my stallion , too . Dad sent Buck Daly out two weeks ago to locate them . " " Locatin ' a little band of horses somewhere in Wyoming , Montana , or Colorado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know about where they arc . A lumber outfit over in Fox Park sent word to Dad they 'd seen them over there near the North Platte . That 's where Thunderhead was a year ago when I toward and I trailed him . It 's one of his hangouts . " " If anyone can trail him , it 's Buck Daly . As good as an Indian scout any day . " They continued to talk until the light changed . Most of the sheep were drawing nearer to the fold for their evening feed of cottoncake . Ken slowly got to his feet and stretched again . Jeremy stood up and walked out from the wagon to look at his sheep . A mile away a group was lingering in the valley . Jeremy turned to his dogs . Ken saw how both collies had their eyes on their master , waiting for orders . Jeremy pointed toward the sheep and made a gesture with his hand . The two dogs shot down the slope , ran across the fields and curved around the sheep . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WYOMINGwith their smooth flowing motion , rippled across the floor of the valley . But there were still some which the dogs had not seen beyond a shoulder of the hill . The two collies , glancing at Jeremy for orders , received this information from a few free gestures of his hand . They investigated behind the hill , rounded up the sheep and brought them to the others . Jeremy waved his arms again , telling the dogs not to hurry the sheep , let them take their time coming in . The clogs lay down , panting , and turned their faces away , and the sheep quieted , grazing slowly as they approached the fold . When Jeremy came back , Ken said , " I 've got to go . " He put his hand in his pocket and took out a small paper . " Here 's the receiptfor the letter Dad took to town and had registered for you . " The herder took it and rummaged in his pocket . " I owe your Dad fifteen cents for the registration fee . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Here 's two nickels and three pennies and a two cent stamp . Sorry I have n't got it all in cash . Do n't lose it . " Ken put the nickels and pennies and stamp very carefully in his watch pocket and mounted his horse . " So long , Jeremy . " " So long , Ken . " The old man stood watching the boy ride away , then went into his wagon and played the Western again . CKen heard it as he rode slowly along the crest . The music had a poignant wistfulness , drifting to him across the space . Before he turned Flicka down the slope he drew rein for a last look around up here on the Saddle Back . Quite close were two antelope , running along the antelope trail which led from the water hole . Seeing him they sheered off to the south . They so perfectly blended with the colors of the range that Ken would not have seen them but for the white , heart-shaped shields which were their rear elevations . An ermine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , undulated over the grass and disappeared into a hole near a rock . This small aristocrat of the plains was a rare sight and Ken kept his eyes on the hole , hoping to catch another glimpse . Presently he saw the head and long neck come up , stare at him a moment , then pop back in again . Ken looked for the storm , the rainbow , the ridge runners , the airplane  --  allgone now . And the world had changed because the lightPI2Iwas changed . There were long shadows . Every outline was soft and mysterious . The colors were richer . There was a new exciting coolness in the wind . Ken drew a deep sigh , but it was not of sadness , it was of emotion . Because Carey was coming , because his life trembled on the brink of this exciting event , everything was significant , everything was important . There drifted to him , from far away , the deep belching roar of the bull . . . . Milking time , and Cricket acting up , as usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive the cows in . A good thing they 'd put the ring in old Cricket 's nose ; fastened him with chains out on both sides of his head and down to a big bolt in the floor of the barn . Could n't move anyway but down . And then Gus had opened the big copper ring on its hinge , and driven the two points through the cartilege of the bull 's nose . Cricket had squirmed and roared , gone down on his knees and rubbed his nose on the ground . But that hurt ! He got up again pretty quick , Gus greased the nose , kept turning the ring in it , then undid the chains and led the bull away , squealing , but as obedient as you please . That roaring ! Just a lot of bluff , now .... Ken touched his heel to Flicka 's side and turned her down the slope . P122EASTWARD ROUND Number Twenty-One roared into the Cheyennestation at 6:45 P.m . The McLaughlins , with the exception of Nell and Penny , were on the platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Englishtweed suit , 1 coward in striped blue flannels and a sport coat , Ken in his best suit of grey French flannel . The two tall , sunburned boys were bareheaded , their dark hair a little rough , their collars opcti , their blue eves eager . The train slowed down and the white-coated porter stepped off and swung luggage down . Carey was the first passenger to be seen . Ken had n't dreamed that he was going to feel like this when he saw her . His heart hit him a thump under his throat . He felt that he would choke if lie tried to say anything . With one look he took in every detail of her as she came down the steps . There was that grave smile , as of a child being very sure to he correct and remembereverything she had been told . It pulled her full lips together in the middle and drew them up at the corners . 11cr dark eyebrows tilting up over her temples made her grey eyes look questioning . A wide-brimmed Breton sailor hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair fell like a mane to the shoulders of her white linen suit . Yes  --  there was the child . Ken was glad she had n't changed . Sometimes , from one year to the next , girls and boys changed so you could hardly know them . He realized vaguely that she was very smart . What was it about the suit ? The jacket was short and the blouse , dark blue . There were the same lovely long legs , slim and brown and smooth . " I low 's the girl ? " cried Rob helping her down and giving her a kiss . " Hello , Mr. McLaughlin . " " Hello , Carey . " " Hello , Ken ; hello , Howard . " " Hello , Carey . " They all shook hands . She gave the porter the tip she had rcady , the boys grabbed her suitcases and there was the usual  |p123scramble  of talk which said nothing and made Ken feel both uncomfortableand excited . Rob McLaughlin took her by the arm and steered her across the platform . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hotel . " " Mother did n't come , because she did n't like to leave Penny , " said Howard . " She sends her love . " " How is the baby ? " Carey addressed this to Ken , looking over her shoulder at him . " She 's okay . " He tried to think of something else to say . " Gee , Carey  --  " It seemed inadequate and ridiculous , but Carey gave him a glance , and it went through him and warmed him . Perhaps she knew all that " Gee , Carey " meant . The hotel dining-room was crowded . They had a round table in the middle of it . They asked the correct and formal questions of each other at first , little by little gathering up the threads of each other 's lives and beginning to feel at ease again . Then Carey wanted to know if they had had any news of Buck Daly ? Had he located Thunderhead and his band of mares ? Had he seen Jewel ? Rob explained that he was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but might at any time , and asked , " What races are you going to put her in , Carey , when you get her hack ? " " First , the American Grand National at Belmont Park , in November , " said Carey calmly , and Ken gasped . Rob laughed . " Two-and-a-half-mile steeplechase ! " That 'll be some going for a youngster . " " That is , " said Carey , " if she 's in condition . We do n't know if she 's been hurt . She might n't be able to run . " " You do n't need to worry about that , " said Rob . " She 's been in charge of a range stallion , remember , and she 's on Wyoming green-grass . " " Wyoming greengrass , " murmured Carey , feeling the lilt of the words . " It sounds like something magic . " " It is , believe me ! " said Rob . " This country up here does something for horses that is out of this world . Gives them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewel will be in better condition than she has ever been in before . " " Oh , it 's the green grass ! " sang I loward softly . Ken opened his mouth to say that Jewel , in all likelihood , was about to become a mother . He glanced around , thought better ofpI24 it and shut his mouth again . Carey was telling Rob of the other races her uncle was thinking of for Jewel . Jewel was to be entered in all the big stakes . Some Army officers whom Rob knew came by and stopped to speak . The boys got up and stood . Again , the talk was of Jewel and the expedition which was to be sent out to get her and of the races she would run in . Her faille , and the interest of her story , had gone all over the state . The officers asked who was going out to get her ? all of us going , " said l Toward . Colonel Harris looked at him . " This is the Cadet , is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . My last vacation here for two years . " ColonelI lards shook hire warmly by the hand . " Welcome to our midst , I loward . Rob , could n't you find a better fate to wish on him ? " Rob went over to their table for a few minutes and now the boys talked more freely . They wanted to know about last fall , after the blizzard , when Carey had left the ranch with her Grandma and uncle . Had she got an awful bawling out from her Grandma for having gone with Ken in the pick-up to the . Monument ? Carey shook her head . Her face was contrite . " Oh , it was n't like that , it was just that it made Grandma ill , she was so worried aboutme . I should n't have done it . " " Is she coming down here with your uncle when we go out afterthe horses ? " " Of course , " said Carey , " your mother has asked her . " The boys looked at each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you go along with us ? " Carey looked doubtful . " I do n't think Grandma would ever let me do that . There wo n't be any other woman along . " " But Dad is going this time ! And your uncle ! " " Look what happened to me last fall . She 'll never get over that . " " But that was because of bad weather . Now it 's summertime . It 'll just be like going off on a summer horseback trip with a lot of fun and excitement thrown in . " Carry heaved a deep sigh . " Oh , I wish I could ! I 'd give anything to ! " Howard said firmly , " There is n't a reason in the world why youp125should not go . Any other girl would  --  any other girl 's mother would let her . You ought to show a little spunk . If your uncle says you can go , then just take a stand ! " " But it might make her ill ! " The two boys looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick every time you did anything that was fun ? " Cripes , Carey ! " said Howard , " You 've got a problem child on your hands . I do n't see how you can take it ! " Carey 's wide grey eyes took on a worried expression . " Well , but Howard , " she said , " you obey your father  --  and your mother too ! " " But they 're reasonable ! " exclaimed Howard . " Your grandmother treats you as if you were a little girl . " Ken said persuasively , " Mother says that everyone in the world has a special problem to solve . I guess she 's yours . I do n't think you ought to knuckle under when there 's no sense in the things she makes you do . " " But she 's not well , " Carey staunchly defended her . " I think she just puts half of that on to make you do what she wants ! " Carey looked doubtful . " That 's what Uncle Beaver thinks . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assert myself . I would like to go to college . " " However did you get to come down and visit us ? " asked Ken . Carey laughed . " Well , it was just hick . You see , when your father wrote to Uncle Beaver to tell him he had sent Buck Daly out to locate the horses he said at the end of the letter that your mother was writing inviting me down right away for a visit . And that same day my Grandma received the letter from your mother , inviting mc . Grandma was writing to say I could n't go until they all went . But Uncle Beaver wired your mother and said I could come , and then told Grandma what he had done . So there was n't any use in her finishing her letter . " The boys laughed loudly . Howard seemed to have a morbid interestin the strange psychology of Mrs. Palmer . " Was she mad ? " he asked hopefully . But Carey would give him no satisfaction . " She did n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner . " Gee ! I 'm glad you came , " said Ken . " So 'm I. " Carey 's eyes were on her plate.  | " We 'll have a lot of fun ! " said Howard . " I want to do everything different from what I do at home , " said Carey . " I do n't want to be wrapped up in cotton wool . I want to wear pants and groom my own horse . And bathe Penny . And cook and make dumplings and doughnuts and strudels , and have a pair of pliers in my pocket and everything . " " Howard and I arc training four spring colts , " said Ken . " You can help us do that . " The boys explained how this was done . Carey listened , her eyes shining , feeling as she had last year , that she was being taken into a new world . Rob returned , they finished their dinner , and got into the Studebaker . Rob stopped at the Creamery for some ice cream to take hone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat behind , between the two boys , and asked them shy the officers had called Howard " the Cadet . " They explained . Catty looked at I IoW and almost with reverence , then gravely shook his hand and said , " Congratulations , Cadet Mc-Laughlin . " Ken writhed inwardly . Was it going to be like this ? Would 1 toward be the one she looked at and admired ? It was tough having your girl see you always with your elder brother who was handsome and full of teasing talk and funny ideas and would soon have a West Point uniform on . " He 's got a girl , " Ken blurted out . " Oh , has he ? " " Hey ! What are you giving us ! " exclaimed T Toward . " Yes he has , her name 's Barbara Bingham and he 's got her picture in a case in his pocket and a big one in his room and he gets two or three airmail letters from her every week . " Ken got all the evidence out before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He winked at Carey and said , " So what ? " Carey kept looking at him smilingly and wonderingly . Ken leaned back in his corner and sat silent and glum . At the ranch , Nell took the girl into her arms and gave her a warm embrace . Carey had fallen in love with Nell the summer before . To be taken in her arms now and hugged and then kissed on both checks , with Nell 's tender , dark blue eyes smiling a welcome , almost made a lump come into her throat . This was the way mothers were . P127She felt her own loss as if it had just happened . She could have put her head down on Nell 's breast and cried because she had no mother and had never known one . Just think what these boys had ! " Come out to the terrace , " called Nell , " when you have put your things away . " " And we 'll have some ice cream , " added Rob . Nell sat there with Rob , while Howard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , opened the closet doors , and then left her . It was the same bedroom in which Carey had slept with her grandmotherthe year before . Carey stood in the middle of the room sniffing . The room had a smell . Every room has its own smell . This seemed to be of wood and something spicy that hung around the big mahogany bureau , and a wonderful freshness and sweetness that came in the open windows . Associated with it were thrills , excitement , fun . It was definitely a smell of happiness . Carey looked out . There was still a soft twilight . She could see the undulations of the plains , the point of a timbered hill running down to the road across the stream , the mountains so far away , the bluish misty color of the sky above the horizon , three faint new stars . A soft wind blew in the window , billowing the curtains , the same chintz curtains with tiny bucking broncos printed on them that had been there last year . That night , when Carey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoot owl calling plaintively . The next moment , it %rented , she rolled over and stretched her arms , yawning , and the **26;1544;TOOLONG sleeves of her pajamas slid to her shoulder , and it was morning , and there was a different smell , smell of coffee and bacon , and the faraway sound of a bull roaring . P129He 's SIMPLY ! curs about her , " said Howard at the end of breakfast , as Carey and Kcn left the room together on their way to the stables . " Ken , you must remember , has n one-track mind , " said Ken 's father . " He 's a lad of one idea . He takes hold and he ca n't let go . " Rob pushed his plate away and gave his undivided attention to Penny who sat on the table just to the right of his water glass , her familiars , position at breakfast . He took hold of her tiny waist , his big hand almost ringing it , and squeezed a little . Penny chortled and grabbed his fingers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Nell . Rob said dryly , " fudging by the way he is crazy about horses , it would be : quite something to sec ! Ken crazy about a girl ! " Nell said , " ' Chat 's just it ! It 's time he knew there was something in life to fall in love with and dream about besides horses . " " I lave a heart , Mum ! " cried Howard . " You know Ken ! If he really falls for a girl , he 'll be all the way loco , not just halfway . " " Ken is possessive , " said Rob , " far too possessive . " Nell glanced at him thoughtfully as she refilled her cup with coffee and placed one elbow on the table . Howard looked from one of his parents to the other . " Possessive ? How do you mean ? " " Whatever he loves or wants , " explained Rob , " has to belong to him completely and exclusively . " " That 's right ! " exclaimed Howard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Flicka ? " Nell remembered . When she had asked Ken why , when he could ride any horse on the ranch , he was so set on his father 's giving him a colt , he had answered , " Oh , Mother , it is n't just the riding . I want a colt to be mine  --  all my own . " She said aloud , " And do you remember how he was about the canaries ? " " ' The canaries ? " " Perhaps that 's too long ago for you to remember , Howard . " pI29But Rob began to laugh . " Ken and his freemale ' ! " he said . Nell explained . " It was the canary year . At the little school you both went to , they were raising canaries , so then all the children wanted to raise canaries at home . You were seven and Ken was five . Ken heard all the talk about males and females and began to beg , But I want a little freemale  --  could n't I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . Howard said , " I bet he got his little freemale . " " He did , " said Nell . " We raised canaries . Did we raise canaries ! They were all over the house . " " And then he wanted another little freemale , Flicka . " Pearl came in and started to remove the dishes . Rob got to his feet , and lifted Penny in his arms . She seized his nose and squeezed it as hard as she could . " Ouch ! " he said , ducking his head against her . She gurgled and grabbed a fistful of hair . " Hey ! Just a minute , " yelled Rob , and the baby burst into one of her hearty laughs , so infectious everyone had to laugh with her . " You 're going to wreck me ! " He carried her to Nell who took her on her lap . As Rob and Howard left the room , Howard turned at the door to look back with a grin . " First the canary , then the filly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when they had gone , sat stirring the sugar into her coffee , thinking .... For all that they say about possession and possessiveness , who is there that is n't ? Who that loves , really loves , would be willing to share ? If they were willing , it would mean that they were lukewarm and indifferent . The possessive ones arc the ardent ones , the all-out ones ; the ones who can give themselves wholly , utterly . Possessiveness is the sweetest part of love , and it 's all of sex ! All the same  --  her face became grave as she remembered how deeply Ken , the ardent , the possessive , had suffered , and would stiffer again . Her thoughts ran ahead to the future . She thought of Carey as Ken 's wife , as her own daughter . Of course it would be years yet , but so often the love of young people is intense , wholehearted , pure , deep and lasting . Many a man marries his first love . Nell had turned over Redwing for Carey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own riding clothes . They were all unpacked , and hung neatly with her other things in the pine-scented closets of her room , with her boots and shoes in a row underneath . In the mornings , with riding and stable work ahead of her , she wore bluejeansand a cotton shirt . In the evenings , she would put on one of her ruffled summer dresses and win an approving smile from Rob . Carey was not only happier than she had ever been in her life , but she knew it . Every day was packed with interest and fun , the more precious because , when her grandmother arrived , the fun would be over  --  unless she screwed up her courage  --  as Howard was always urging her to du  --  and took a stand ! and insisted on being allowed to go on the expedition With the others . If she did n't  --  her mind envisionedthe departure of the expedition  --  on horseback or in cars ; the boys riding away ; herself kit behind with her grandmother and Nell ; and the baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she made the most of this interlude of freedom and did the things she had always longed to do . Shc helped Nell give Penny her bath and dress her . Shc put on a big apron and , under Pearl 's direction , Made an excellent batch of doughnuts . She made acquaintance with all the animals and learned their histories . A cocker hitch had been procured some time ago as a mate for Chaps , and now the pups were six weeks old , as beautiful a litter as could be desired , with soft , curly hair all over their bodies and sweet little domed heads from which depended long silky cars . Daisy , the bitch , was not in favor . Recently she had dug a hole under the fence of the chicken yard and devoured eighteen baby chicks . For a bird dog , there was no excuse . Stern frowning looks were Daisy 's portion . No such thing had ever happened before on the Goose Bar Ranch and it was a disgrace . Daisy knew it . She had formed the habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casting hang-dog looks at her master . Rob did n't feel it was good for a dog . Nobody knew what to do with such a dog as Daisy . There were stories for Carey to hear about the cats , too . Cats , it seemed , both wild and tame , inhabited the woods , and appeared without notice at the door of a ranch house when they wanted a little domesticity . A gentle , grey tabby cat , white-breasted , who looked like a stuffed cat to be set on the mantelpiece , had appeared from nowhere one day . They called her Susie . She got a litter of kittens about the same time Pauly got hers , but Susie 's were born dead . Nell decided that Pauly could spare a couple of her five husky kits to assuage the pangs of disappointed motherhood in poor littleP131Susie . So she fixed up a box for Susie and gave her two of Pauly 's kittens . But that was n't enough to suit Susie . One by one she stole every one of Pauly 's kittens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them back again . Then Susie stole them . It was all they did  --  carry those kits from box to box . At last , one morning , they had worked it out . Pearl had found the two mother cats and all five kittens in one box together . They brought them up in partnership , both nursed them , both licked and washed them , both hunted for them and fed them . The boys were training four colts . Carey helped them . They spent the morning doing this , halter-breaking the foals , teaching them to lead , to obey orders , to eat oats out of the hand . Then , at noon , they would go into the swimming pool which was really a reservoir for the irrigation ditches . Carey loved this . To float on her back staring up at the deep blue sky , watching the clouds moving so slowly across the heavens , the hills going up around her so that she seemed to be at the bottom of a cup ; and she would muse about these new friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  what was the matter with Nell ? You never seemed quite to get at her , as if she was shut up in herself with some secret . Carey 's reverie was broken by a vigorous splashing as the boys tore past her  --  just showing off . They rode their horses down to the pool , bareback , in their bathingsuits and rode them back again , soaking wet . More than once they put the horses into the pool and made them swim , time They took long rides over the plains , or to do errands for Rob , or to inspect the fences . They gossiped with the men and heard of all that was going on in the country . The evenings were long and light . It seemed as if , in the gentle twilight hours , the fruit of the day was gathered up and eaten . Sometimes Nell and Carey played ducts . Sometimes they all sat on the terrace and talked while the animals hung around , turning their curious and affectionate eyes upon the different members of the family . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the meadows to Castle Rock . Carey glanced around . She was sitting on the steps of the terrace , watching the puppies playing .   Nell was indoors at the piano . Rob was near by , occupied with Penny , a highball on the table beside him . He had drawn the baby between his knees , her tiny hands were busy with the buckle of his belt and there came from her lips a stream of talk without intelligiblewords but of so pure and birdlike a tone , so innocent , so mindless , that Carey wondered at the sweetness of it . " I low about it , Carey ? " Carry had heard about Castle Rock . The boys had told her of the finding of the carcass of Rocket 's foal there , half-devoured by the wildcat , and of all the other skeletons and grisly remains in the caves under the rock . She would like to sec it . And an evening walk alone with hen through the meadows  --  the thought slightly quickened her pulse . Still , there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she was reluctant to leave it . I lows aril , chinning himself on one of the poles of the pergola , said , " Whs. do n't you take your gun ? I 'll come along and we 'll get some cottontails . Nell was coming out the door . " Do n't shoot any cottontails today . We have more meat on hand than we need . I want to talk to you , Howard . " Nell sat down in the hammock and Ken and Carey started off . Howard stood looking down at his mother questioningly . Her face was merry as she looked back at him . There was a little teasinggrin . She patted the hammock beside her and he fitted himself in , flung his arm around her and pulled her against his shoulder . " Why , " she said , taking hold of his hands which were clasped across her chest , " do you want to cut out Ken with Carey ? " " Wha  --  a-at ? " exclaimed Howard . " Why , Mother ! " " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pull out of his arms , but he held her tight . " I 'm on to you . But what I really want to ask you about is Barbara Bingham . " All her senses were alert , and clasped against his chest as she was , she could feel the slight reaction of his body to this name  --  a tension , a waiting . " Howard , you are so secretive ! " she cried . " Why do you make . r mystery about this girl ? " " I do n't make any mystery . " He rubbed his chin on her hair tenderly . " Yes , you do ! All these important-looking letters coming ! Air mails ! Special deliveries ! Although who could specially deliver aP133letter to us here on the ranch I can not imagine , unless a coyote or an eagle . " Howard laughed , but even though Nell waited , he volunteered nothing . " Is she the girl , Howard ? " " Well , I guess she is , Mother . " " More than Carey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I like Barbara 's looks , judging from the pictures of her you have around , but if she is to be my daughter-in-law , I 'd like to know it . " Howard made no answer to this , and Nell muttered impatiently , " Oh , you make me tired ! " She struggled to free herself , Howard releasedher , stood up , then stooped , gave her a quick kiss and leaped off the terrace . He walked down to the cowbarn . Nell sat , touching her foot to the ground , so that the hammock swung a little . Now and then , her eyes rested on Rob and the baby . She felt something moist and warm on her bare ankle . Looking down she saw one of the curly-haired cocker pups . The little red tongue was licking her ankle . She picked it up and held it close . The puppy thrust its nose inside the collar of her dress and heaved a deep sigh . They were very sweet , she thought , but there were too many of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were old enough to be given to their new owners . We will keep one , she thought , perhaps this one , little Willy . There came a deep roar from the corral of the cowbarn . Usually , after evening milking and feeding was over , the bull was quiet . Sometimes he went out to pasture with the cows , sometimes , even when the cows had left him , he remained in the corral where he had received his feed , standing there motionless in one of his dark meditationsupon the primal joys of blood and lust . He appeared to live in a chronic state of smoldering fury , viewing any person , any movingthing , any life outside himself , as something which it was his duty to put an end to . Even the calves were not safe with him . Only the cows . " Rob , " said Nell , " I wish you 'd sell Cricket , or have him butch-ered . " Rob made no answer . He was absorbed in trying to discover what Penny had , shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wee fingers . She resisted him and squirmed in his grasp.  | " Rob ! " said Nell . " Oh , he 's all right , " said Rob , " now that I 've put the ring in his nose . It 's Howard he 's yelling at . " He raised his voice . " Howard ! " he shouted . " Cut that out ! " " I 'm not doing anything , " Howard shouted back , then wandered up from the cowbarn to the bunkhouse . The men were sitting outof-doorson the wooden benches which flanked the front door . Here they gossiped the long evenings away , falling into silence when music came from Nell 's piano . Howard joined them . Cricket ceased his bellow lugs . And Nell 's foot touched the ground , and gave her hammock a In tic push , and another , and another . . . . She wondered where Pilgrim was and her eves wandered , searching . She knew he gas looking at her from some hideout , from the grass behind the spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of the path Trading tip to the barn , but she could see no sign of him . She put Willy down . Willy picked up a leaf , lifted his head proudly and trotted down the terrace carrying it with an important air. bevond the flower border a strange performance was going on . Dairy , the mother cocker , had conceived a maternal passion for Pauly . She took the cat by the neck with her delicate spaniel hold . She dragged her and carried her as she had carried and dragged the puppies whom she no longer permitted to approach her . And Pauly furled all her talons and curled in her paws and went limp , her eyes half closed with the ecstasy of returning to the helplessness of her kittenhood . There was a movement farther away on the Green . It was the black cat who , one day last summer , had suddenly emerged from the woods to pay court to Pauly . But Pauly already had a lover in the person of the large yellow cat who had been named Matilda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a night of terrible feline screams , there was silence , and thereafter Matilda came no more but the black cat came instead , the battle on the cliff opposite the house had been guessed . The boys named the newcomer Bagheera , after Kipiing 's black panther . They all wondered if Pauly had been watching while the two tom cats fought for her . She might , thought Nell , have been lying stretched out on a rock in the moonlight , relaxedand pleased , purring , casting only occasional glances at her suitors while they tore each other to pieces . After Matilda had been eliminated , Pauly and Bagheera had fallen in love and would lie look/ing at each other for hours at a time , about ten feet apart , their paws tucked in , all the world forgotten . Bagheera , now , was creeping with silent panther steps toward a little pile of fresh dirt on the lawn which marked a gopher hole . Willy caught sight of him , dropped his leaf , burst into blithe yappingsand frolicked forward to have a game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bagheera , batting his paws in the air . With glaring eyes the black cat rose up , delivered a flurry of lightning swift slaps on the puppy , then turned his dignified back and slowly walked away . Willy rolled over , unhurt , but puzzled , twisting his head first to one side , then the other . While Nell swung gently in the hammock and watched the intelligentplay of the animals , her thoughts wandered . . . . Guests coming before long . . . rooms to get ready ... long talks with Pearl . . . how was the old lady going to behave . . . Ken .. . Howard ... Fourth of July ... .
