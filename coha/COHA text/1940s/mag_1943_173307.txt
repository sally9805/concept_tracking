In a high-ceilinged study of the Spazzo House in Moscow , a group of correspondents heard their host , U.S. Ambassador William Harrison Standley , say that the Russian people were not being given the full story of U.S. aid ( TIME , March 15 ) . <P> Element of Frankness . Most people wanted to know whether the Ambassador had been instructed to say his piece . Said Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles , " Whatever was said in this reported press conference was said without prior consultation with or reference to this Government . " In effect : pipe down , Admiral Standley . <P> The President saved himself some talking ( and caused some ) by canceling his press conference the day after the Standley remarks were published . When he was questioned later about the " element of frankness in the character of our admirals , " the President replied evasively that sometimes they were too frank , sometimes not frank enough . Mr. Roosevelt certainly knew how Admiral Standley felt on the subject . When the Ambassador visited Washington last October , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly on military matters . <P> Answer to Frankness . The Russian reaction was prompt and compliant . Izvestia printed recapitulations of U.S. aid to Russia recently made by Lend-Lease Administrator Edward Stettinius Jr . A Moscow radio announcer broadcast similar material at a convenient speed for stenographers to take it down-a tip-off that provincial papers were expected to print it . Ambassador Litvinoff in Washington said : " Supplies received through Lend-Lease have been an enormous help and as such deeply appreciated by the people of the Soviet Union , who are fully aware of its extent . " <P> There undoubtedly were reasons why the Russians had made no effort to stress U.S. aid in their home press . Russians , after the Japanese , are perhaps the most suspicious and secretive people in the world . The lack of a European second front still angers them , and last week they resumed their storming for one . When thousands of Russians are being killed every day , they can not go into ecstasies over U.S. planes and tanks . They have , moreover , a profound dislike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Airplanes . Without official reminders , Russian pilots know when it is U.S. planes they are flying , soldiers when it is U.S. shoes they wear , housewives when they use U.S. flour , sugar , lard and canned meats . New York Times Correspondent Ralph Parker went to a Moscow " gastronom " where the grocer told him : " Of course , we have had the American goods here . Not a lot ; I should say about 10% of the total over six months . " <P> " How do you know the goods are American ? " <P> " By the marks , of course . " <P> At lunch with a Russian family , Correspondent Parker 's hostess said : " Hope you will like the sausages . We have some American ones today . " He asked her how she knew . <P> " By the can , " she said , " but do n't you think we Russians know our own sausages ? "                    @
