The management of U.S. industry was filled with the comforting thought that it had done its duty . By granting pay raises which labor unions felt they could accept , management had shown a degree of economic statesmanship . But had it shown enough ? <P> The wage raises , which had brought peace to heavy industry , would help keep up the purchasing power of many union members . To that extent , the boosts would lessen the effects of high prices and the dangers of a slump . But the benefiting unionists were only a small minority of consumers . The No. i problem for the U.S. was still to keep up the purchasing power of the majority . This could be done only by lowered prices . Was it not time that management showed a high degree of economic statesmanship-and lowered prices on a broad scale ? Were not profits so high-despite wage increases-that businessmen could afford to lower prices ? <P> Last week , businessmen were told " yes . " This time the telling was done , not by unions or other outsiders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business committee . On it sits such industrial brass as Macy 's Beardsley Ruml and General Electric 's C. E. Wilson . Said N.P.A. in the bluntest warning business has yet received about its price policies : regardless of the reasons for the dangerous price situation , the responsibility for correcting it was " squarely up to businessmen . Other economic groups must cooperate . But it is to the risk-takers of our system that the public logically looks for risk-taking . " Consumer prices have outrun consumer purchasing power and " price increases , with some significant exceptions , also ran ahead of costs and thus brought a sharp expansion of profits in 1946 and through the first quarter of 1947 . . . . Abnormally high earnings such as these can not last . Many prices today are badly out of line and must be brought down . If orderly price reductions do not become more general , business must share the blame for the slump that is sure to come . "                 @ @ @ @
