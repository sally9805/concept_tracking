This month 31,566,000 U.S. citizens , big &; small , go to school-160,000 fewer than last year . Despite this record decline in total school population ( resulting from the declining birth rate ) , school officials in Washington last week bemoaned the worst overcrowding of schools in U.S. history . Reason : a major shift of the population to defense-production centers . <P> Cases in point are Omaha and the District of Columbia . Omaha schools have a seating capacity and normal enrollment of 6,000 ; this month , thanks to a new Glenn Martin plant , they have 7,778 additional pupils and no place to put them . Washington has at least 7,000 newcomers . If they were spread over the city , there would be plenty of room , but they are concentrated in the southeast section , near the Navy Yard . Result : school officials last week planned to teach in storerooms , gymnasiums , basements , nine old portable schoolhouses resurrected from World War I. They also decided to run schools in morning and afternoon shifts , cutting short each pupil 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. , some 329,000 children were in a similar fix . The Federal Office of Education estimated that 200,000 would crowd into present or makeshift classrooms . The remaining 129,000 would have to get their education in tents or portable houses , or go without schooling . <P> Besides the classroom shortage , there was a teacher shortage in defense centers . In Washington , confusion was further confounded by a shortage of school janitors , many of whom had quit for defense jobs . <P> Anticipating this crisis , Congress had passed the Lanham Act , appropriating $150,000,000 for schools and other public facilities in defense centers ( TIME , July 14 ) . But the schools ran into all sorts of priorities and bottlenecks . The Federal Works Agency , in charge of the fund , gave first call to water and sewers . Of 600 emergency schoolhouses applied for , only 29 had final approval last week and none was yet under construction . <P> Screwiest mixup was in Baltimore , where the voters had authorized a $10,000,000 bond issue for new schoolhouses in May 1939 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than $100,000 of it , seized upon national defense last week as a pretext for halting school construction altogether . His excuse : building costs were high ; labor and steel were scarce ; it would be better to spend the $10,000,000 after the emergency to relieve unemployment . Informed of the mayor 's action at a press conference last week , youth-minded Eleanor Roosevelt exclaimed : " Horrible ! " <P> Meanwhile , without batting an eye , Mayor Jackson admitted that although he refused to spend the city 's money he had applied for $875,000 under the Lanham Act to build schools .
