WE DEBATED whether the daps would strike again , and if so , when . But all doubts were resolved for us that morning  --  at 11:45 . December ninth , Wake time . At that moment , twenty-seven unwelcome visitors appeared overhead to pay their party call . They knew there was no hope of repeating the surprise attack of the previous day and , having evidently decided to take as few chances as possible with our antiaircraft batteries , came in at a very high and respectful altitude . This time we had a brief but useful advance notice of their coming  --  one that saved a lot of lives . I was near the woods and I bolted into them . By the time the enemy squadron arrived , I had run through the scrub along a trail which brought me out on the beach near a huge coral boulder . I reached it safely and snuggled down at its base . Here I could count on as much protection from bullets and flying scrap as the island afforded . Today , the twenty-seven bombers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their attack on civilian Camp 2 . The heaviest explosions I heard came from that direction , when I could hear them at all over the roar of our near-by antiaircraft guns . Although it seemed to last for hours , the raid was over in a few minutes , and 1 hurried back through the woods to the airport , afraid of what I might find there . ? We had escaped scot-free , but while I was still feeling thankful for that , the news from the Camp 2 area came in . The naval radio station and the temporary offices had been knocked to pieces . The civilian barracks had been hit by bombs and strafed by machine guns . More than fifty civilians had been killed and there were many wuunded , but harder to take than anything else was the fact that the.naval hospital had seen bombed and several patients killed . A Tally for Our Grummans THAT was the crowning infamy . After the demon ! . stration they had given us on the first day , we no longer questioned the accuracy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had deliberately bombed the hospital , where they knew their shrapnel would find wounded men crowded together and helpless in bed , unable to run for shelter . I swung aboard a truck that was leaving for Camp 2 , wanting to see for myself if things could be as bad as reported . They were . The whole area was simply one God-awful mess . Young Spider Webb , of Oxford , North Carolina , had had a curious experience . Lying on his cot , semi-delirious from fever , he had been calling for water just as the alert sounded . A metal pitcher was rushed to him and placed on the low table beside his bed . He was reaching for it when it suddenly began to spout water from holes in its side . A burst of machine-gun bullets had swept through the ward and punctured I stayed there , helping to restore some semblance of order , until my watch warned me dusk was approaching and I 'd better get back to my own bailiwick . By that time the wounded were already being transported to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up in the two heavily concreted , bombproof powder magazines . The naval hospital itself , besides being exposed to further attack , was no longer usable . Worst of all , a great deal of its surgical equipment and medical stores had been destroyed . I found an air of grim satisfaction pervading the port Our four Grummans had dropped from the sky upon the twenty-seven raiders , and before things got too hot for comfort they had cut out a stray bomber and sent it flaming into the sea . Everybody was feeling bucked up by the exploit . Wake had struck back . Immediately after the first air raid , we had realized the vital importance of getting underground . Everybody got hold of shovels and picks  --  some even used plain wooden boards  --  and dug or scooped out holes . I passed that night in a small foxhole which I had managed to construct for myself near the shore . It was just large enough to hold a General Issue ( G , I. ) pad , my equipment and myself . I slept there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wake Island rats , who seemed to think I had made it as a home-from-home for them . Then water began to come in at high tide . I might have stood being flooded , but the rats could n't . They took to sleeping on me to keep their feet dry , and that was too much . I moved to more spacious quarters behind a pile of loose coral . This second foxhole was lined with sandbags . rigged up a lean-to of sticks and made myself a rainproof roof out of un old poncho . For interior decoration I had my other pair of shoes and pictures of my wife and daughter , reclaimed from my wrecked tent . I kept house quite comfortably for another three days , till once again I was driven out by a new horde of lazy , slow-moving , bearded rats . What that island needed , I decided , was a shipload of terriers. dead and saw crimson . When somebody told them I was a duly qualified recruiting officer , it was all they needed . They came from across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even a single recruit is a cherished prize to a recruiting officer . Imagine my feelings that day when I had to turn away , by actual count , 186 potential U. S. marines , fine , strapping men who pleaded with tears in their eyes for permission to join the corps and have a crack at those Japs . It could n't be done . Technically it might have been okay , but we did n't know just how far we could count on the Japs to respect a technicality . Suppose some of these men should be taken prisoner ? The Japs would call them armed civilians , or bandits , or guerrillas , and they would be fodder for the firing squad . IL would n't do . It 's not easy to explain to an angry man that the Geneva Convention wo n't let him fight for his life . I tried it that day , 186 times . We did make jobs for eleven of them by accepting their services in strictly nonmilitary capacities . These were older men  --  expert mechanics , carpenters , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I. After that , we had to watch ' Feeler 's crew . We did n't dare put down a rifle or a pistol if there was a civilian within ten yards or he 'd be on it in a flash . Our marines found a lot to interest them in the bits of shrapnel they were gathering up from our bombed area . Some of them were recognizable fragments of American manufacture , such as scissors from ? well-known make of sewing machine or fragments of farm machinery . One of the boys had two radiator caps of a style once very familiar . They were not pleased , these men , and they gave their opinion , in pungent phrases , of a policy that included selling scrap to a probable future enemy . Some of the more irrepressible spirits got a wry laugh out of their souvenirs . One skinny , bright-eyed private told me solemnly that he was collecting only automobile parts , hoping to get enough to assemble a complete new car . Another confessed a boyhood crime . He and some other kids had once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an abandoned smithy and sold it to a junk dealer . Now he claimed he was gravely worried . " Jes goes to show how retribution will catch up with a sinner , " he said in a slow Southern drawl . " I reckon I 've only got to stay here awhile an ' someday I 'll look around to see that anvil comin ' straight at my haid . " Just then three pistol shots cracked in the distance . " Mebbe it 's comin ' now ! " he concluded . The words reached me only faintly , for he was streaking for his favorite foxhole while I was racing for my coral boulder on the beach . As on the previous day , the Japs had sent us twenty-seven bombers . Fortunately , this time the results were different . A few bombs landed in the lagoon . There was no damage nor any casualties . The three pistol shots were an alert . Regulations now were that the first person to see a Jap plane should signal neighboring units on the island by yanking out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alarm to be repeated down the line by others who heard it . As a further precaution after hostilities broke out , everything at night was done in a total blackout . The need for that precaution presented a problem in the servicing and repairing of our planes . So an underground hangar , as light-tight as human ingenuity could make it , was hastily built , with civilian aid . Jimmy Devereux spent a lot of his time thinking of all the stunts the Japs might pull and devising better stunts to beat them . They might , for instance , try to glide down on the runway by night , landing machine-gun units and ton:Inv gunners to knock us off . To prevent this , every evening at dusk heavy pieces of transportation were run out onto the strip and parked there . The airdrome itself ( Continued on Pogo 37 ) ( Continued from Page 291 was mined with heavy charges of dynamite buried at intervals of 200 feet . The-se were wired to three different batteries . for good measure . and in the event of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rush surface craft through to the lagoon , so we blacked the channel entrance with our largest lighter . The barge was loaded to the gunwales with massive concrete blocks , and a very heavy charge of dynamite , wired for instant use , was tucked away in her interior . I found an opportunity at last to walk over to Camp 1 and take a look at the wreckage of my original tent home . An incendiary bomb had apparently scored a direct hit , landing smack on my pillow ; it had passed through the mattress and cot and through the wooden deck to the ground underneath , where it burned itself out . It had partially fired the whole tent , destroying my one remaining bag and my toilet articles . The bag contained all my clothing except what I was wearing and the underwear which I had bundled up to be laundered . I poked through the debris till I found the pictures of my wife and little girl . They wen. scorched , and stained by the pelting rain which had fallen on Monday night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could be cleaned up a bit and would lend a homelike atmosphere to my rat-infested foxhole . A dissolute , rakish air was added to the scene by a couple of cans of beer which had been lofted through the air from the officers ' club and dropped on my bunk . I had the most pleasant recollections of that club . though I had enjoyed its comforts for only a few days before the war . Those days already seemed remote , though it had been hardly more than fifty hours since the first bombs fell on Wake . The club had been a cheerful spot , especially in the evening , when nearly everybody dropped in . It boosted a few bridge tables , with varicolored fabric covers to give the room a homey appearance . Decks of cards and boxes of poker chips were available for the convenience of penny-ante enthusiasts . Private Baths de Luxe The bar was a rough wooden plank stretched across one end of the room . A stack of voucher cards always stood on it . During the day the oasis was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted in the way of beer and signed a chit . In the evening a young lieutenant who was treasurer of the club took his stand behind the plank and obligingly dispensed highball/A . Since then , some Jan bombardier had taken over the dispensing job ; bottles of liquor were strewn all over the place , many of them unbroken . I salvaged a quart of bourbon to take to my dugout , thinking the rats might like it . Sometimes , if enough of us wanted to , we would turn out the reconnaissance car , hitch a trailer to it . and go careening through the black night to Dan Teeters ' motion-picture show . Sometimes we would have noisy arguments , which we flattered by calling debates . Hank Elrod , of Thomasville , Georgia . Paul Putnam 's executive officer , always shone in these . He would toss some provocative statement into the conversation , then defend it tooth and nail against criticism and attack . Elrod was a strong , well-built fellow who liked to take his pleasures the hard way . As we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mountain , Mississippi , reminded me of the night when Hank and big McKinstry put on a wrestling match . They went to it , half naked , on the bare wooden floor , which was rough and splintery . Both men emerged with scratches and abrasions from stem to stern . After the club shower bath became a relic of departed days , baths became a problem on Wake . We worked hard for endless periods of time , until we were tired and hot and sweaty . But now there was nothing to do about it except take a plunge in the lagoon or a trip to the beach . Nature at least had done her best for us . There were innumerable shallow potholes in the coral shore which provided each of UR with a private tub . The water would be punctually emptied and replaced by the action of the tide . During the day , the sun would heat the baths to just the right temperature . It was a joy to lie down in one of those things and relax  --  always keeping an eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning of Thursday , December eleventh , a terrific crash that seemed to shake the whole atoll brought me to my feet . 1 sprang erect from my sleeping pad , blanket and all , an abruptly that I dislodged the roof of my fragile lean-to . The whole sky was lit up by a series of vivid orange-colored flashes , like the flickering of lightning . I could hear the howling of shells as they swept across the Leland , the cramp-trump-trump of their explosions as they struck the bench , the woods and the airfield area . Meanwhile I was buckling on my gun , getting my tin hat Rattled and stamping my feet into boots . My one thought was to get to the command post and learn what was happening . I could tell . from the direction of the firing , that Wake was being attacked from the sea , but that was all I knew . I sprinted on a beeline in the direction of the command post , jumping boulders. skirting old bomb craters , leaping over somebody else 's foxhole , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again suffused the skies . If a chunk of shrapnel should buzz up and want the space my body had been occupying , I was n't going to argue with it . A thumbnail sketch of my progress toward the command post would read like this . Flare . . flop . . interval , . sprint ! Flare . . flop . . - interval . . sprint ! But it was n't so amusing as it sounds . If the Japs had been firing at will , I never could have made it . The fact that they were firing in salvos , with precious seconds between , was a break for me . When I tumbled into the command post I could hardly believe I 'd come through alive , let alone unscathed . Paul Putnam was there , and helping him was Staff Sgt. Robert 0 . Arthur , of Sacramento , California , temporarily attached to Aviation , and a pilot in his own right . ' . Paul brought me up to date on what the shooting was about . The dawn patrol had hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full speed for the southwestern quarter of Wake . The Grumrnans dropped low enough in the dim gray Light to identify a light cruiser. gunboat , several destroyers and a ouple of larger ships that might he either transports or supply craft . The patrol radioed the alarm . Seeing themselves discovered , the Japs opened up with antiaircraft guns . The planes answered with a pair of 100-pound bombs apiece , then turned and headed for the base for a fresh supply . The Japs Came In for the Kill Jimmy Devereux ordered the men to battle stations . A second order followed swiftly . Every man not assigned to some definite activity must seek cover . Between telephone calls from all over the island , Paul and I set ourselves to read the enemy mind . We did n't find it too difficult . For three days in succession , their bombers had subjected us to a softening-up process . They had dumped torte of high explosives on a very small area of ground . They had flown so low the first day that they could see our grounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke from oil and gasoline tanks . They must have assumed  --  and they had come close to being correct  --  that their bombing and strafing had killed or wounded a considerable percentage of our cattail defense force . No doubt they knew we had four planes still able to fly , but what of that ? As they saw it , they could count on their antiaircraft fire to keep our Grummans at a distance . They thought they had crippled us ; now they were coming in for the kill . They would expect it to be a wsrl kover . To upset their calculations , we had only one battery of 5 ? inch guns , four planes of doubtful value , and less than 100 United States marines . On the credit side of the ledger , however , we had two Resets ; both important  --  the guns would be well handled and the marines were fighting mad . As soon as they got Wake within range of their big guns , the Japs had opened with those salvos which had snaked ini ? out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he island from end to end and from side to side as they drew nearer the bench on which they meant to land . Our four planes were up there , doing some useful methodical stuff of their own . The Japs had no aircraft , carrier with their armada and they were much ton far from their base to use fighter planes , so our Grummans had the air to themselves . I could see our boys take off into the wind , then disappear in the direction of the battle . Thereafter , I could keep only uncertain track of their activities by the occasional fragments of interplane conversation which came to my ears over the ground-air radio . The reports were usually flippant , and the chitchat was decorated with plain and fancy profanity . Listening to all that language , I felt a little like God . Mr. Elrod , speaking to his side-kick , Mr. Tharin , of Washington , D. C. : " Hi , EVENING POST Duke ! See that big fat rat straight ahead ? " " I see him . Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sashay off to the right and come down on him from your side . I 'll do the same from mine . That way we 'll divide his fire , anyhow . All set , kiddo ? " " Whenever you say , Baron . " " Hold on ; duty before pleasure . Got to report . " " Tell ' em to have a couple of D.F.C . ' s waiting for us when we get back . " " The hell with ' em ; I 'll settle for a cuppa cawfee . . . . Come in , command post . Pilot Elrod calling C.P. Pilot Elrod calling C P Hi , Walt , are you listenin ' ? " Was I listening ! " Pilots Elrod and ' Main , only two-man squadron of the skies , about to attack eneriy for umpty-umph time . Hope some of you are keepin ' count . I lost track long ago . That 's all , C P Hi , Duke , how about it ? " " I 'm cravin ' action . Keep away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew on her nearly shot away my pants last time I went over her . " " Thanks for t he tip . pardner . Now , let 's go ! " Sometimes the voices would stop and I could hear the wind screaming past the planes and the roar of their engines as they went into a power dive . There 'd be a few moments of breathless suspense , then the sharp rattle of machine guns as they opened fire on the enemy deck . I could n't hear the bombs being released as they pulled out of their dives , swcp over their victim and tore away . Rut I heard a shout from Elrod " Duke , you hit him ! You hit him wit your second ! " " Yeah ? I was travelin ' too fast t .. notice . " " You hit him ! . . , Hi , Walt ! Duke hit a big baby smack on th ' snout ! She 's afire forrard ! Looker the smoke ! " " You did n't do so bad yourself , Baren That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivets . " " C'mnn . Le 's go back for nourishment . My gas is low an ' 130.8 my ammunition . . . . Whoa . Look over there . Duke . . . two points off your starboard haw ! What 's that ' ? " " I see . Weill I get my glasses on her . nh-oh . She looks like  --  yes , sir , that 's light cruiser Wills ' along ! " " Cripeg ! Are we sittin ' on top of th ' whole Jim navy ? " April lu , IY.71 " Jeez ! " In this case , a four-letter word meaning just pure ecstasy . " Would n't that be wuritierful ? " Four little fighters on top of the whole Jap navy . " Wunnerful " was the word , I thought . The only word that came anywhere near summing up the high spirits , the courage and the morale of those youngsters . In a few minutes they would come gliding down and make smooth , competent landings on the coral strip . Shells might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do about that , and they did n't let it bother them . A bump or two , and then their wheels would be churning up clouds of white dust as they taxied to the rearming pits . If there was not much servicing to be done on a plane , the pilot would wait beside it , pacing restlessly until he could jump in the cockpit and be off again . Sometimes , if the armorers ' hurried inspection revealed the need for a more extensive job of tinkering , the boys would hustle over to the command post for a cigarette , a drink of cold water , hot coffee or an exchange of bulletins . Paul Putnam was busy enough running his end of the show . He was riding the armorers ruthlessly , ordering them to have more and more bombs ready and more and more loaded belts of machine-gun ammunition . To lighten this labor , I rushed over to the foxhole where my stuff was stored and dug up a small handcart which I contributed to the cause . Meanwhile where were our guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that question . The Japs were not yet within easy range of our 5-inchers , and Jimmy Devereux , like a good artilleryman , was holding his fire till it would be 100 per cent effective . To blaze away now would give away their position and enable the enemy to stay out of range while his heavier guns made a leisurely business of knocking out our one battery . Then a phone rang , and I saw Paul 's eyes brighten as he took a message . I whipped my earphones off as he turned toward me . " That was Devereux . " he said . " He 's going to give the order to commence firing , and he wants our fellows to observe results and report . Pass he word aloft , will you ? " Three of our planes were up . The fourth was in the rearming pit for what Baron Elrod had termed " nourishment . " Paul ran out to give him the order while I passed the tidings along to the topside ( Conionued on Page 40 ) Cost:sisal from POP ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy , sounding like a litter of hungry pups when mamma turns up with supper . Then I heard Tharin 's speculative voice , " So we 're to observe results , eh , Baron ? Now what would you say 's the best way to do that ? " " Why , Duke , I 'd say the best way to observe anything is to get close to it as possible . Mebbe we ought to do that , huh ; ? , " I reckon we ought . If were goin ' to be observers , we would n't want to miss anything , would we ? " Sergeant Arthur looked around to see i why I suddenly laughed nut loud . 1 told him what I 'd heard , and he grinned . The t two-man squadron would wait till the battery selected its target and then go tearing down to smokestack level , taking advantage of the confusion to wham home a pair of bombs apiece . Then it came . All six guns let go at the , ..... anme moment only a few hundred yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through to me , " Hi , Walt ! They it her ! The gunboat ! Every shot hit er close to the water line . Walt , yo hnuld ' a ' seen her ! She jumped ten fee n the air , an ' now she 's listin ' like n y 's business . I got in a bomb  --  righ in the skipper 's lap  --  and so did ? ' So did Baron Elrod , I guess he meant , but the name was drowned out by a second salvo from Peacock Point . Carne Tharin 's exultant voice again , - That finished her . Walt ! . . . Oops ! There goes her magazine ! She 's sinkin ' . " He added ruefully , " Dammit , why did I waste that bomb ? I should ' a ' stuck to ohservin ' ! " I told him bitterly he deserved to be down in this C.P. hole , missing all the fireworka . The . laps prnmptly fired at the flashes from Peacock Point , but Tharin reported that their marksmanship was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whoop of delight from him . c- " Write nff one ' Tap destroyer , Walt ! Cripes , those things are just tin cans , are n't they ? She 's damn near under already ! " His voice went flat abruptly - 1h disgust . " Oh  --  oh , hell ! " " What is it ? " I demanded . " She riming up again ? " " Nn , but th ' big fellers are Isheerin ' off ! Good gosh . do you suppose they 'll heat it without ever c.omin ' into range ? " Considering what they had seen of Ne. 1 Battery , I thought even a . lap might have sense enough to stay out of range . I was explaining this to Tharin and telling him it was too soon to be optimistic , when two more salvos in swift succession caught the second destroyer smack in the torpedoes . The remaining 4 ships of the battered armada drew off as if to lick their wounds and figure out a new plan of attack . Tharin and Elrod returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they had something on their minds . When a shout from the pits told them the planes were rearmed and ready , Elrod glanced at Paul Putnam and cleared his throat . " Sir , " he said , with unwonted formality , " there 's a Japanese cruiser out there . We think she must be the flagship of the outfit , because she 's been hanging back and keeping out of range while shelling the island . " He cleared his throat again . " Duke and I have been thinking of attacking her if  --  if it 's okay . " Paul looked startled , and I guess I did too . It was n't according to Hoyle for two small fighter planes carrying only 100-pound bombs to attack a cruiser . Then the skipper glanced at Elrod 's face and nodded . " All right , Captain Elrod ; you may attack , " he said and added , " Bear in mind , though , we 're rather shy of planes . Keep reasonably high , and make a point of dodging the antiaircraft . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . " C'm on , Duke ! " " Coming , " said Tharin promptly , but looking mildly doubtful as they headed for the door . " Y'knov.t , Baron , I 've heard it said it 's impossible to sink a capital ship with small bombs . " " Oh , yeah ' ? " retorted Elrod . " Well , if it 's impossible , it 'll take a little longer , so let 's get started . " They departed for the pits , and Putnam and I stepped out to see them take off and watch the planes zoom upward at an angle which would give them plenty of altitude by the time they were over the Jap cruiser . Glancing sideways , I noticed Paul Putnam was staring at the diminishing specks with an odd bleakness in his eyes . I knew what was biting him . A man of action , he was resentful of the duty which kept him chained to the command post . He was fiercely jealous of Elrod and Tharin 's good fortune . We went hack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table between us and waited for returns from the ringside . They came remarkably soon , a brief exchange from plane to plane , advising us ( Confinved on Pogo 42 ) ( Confirnrd from Page 40 ) that the boys were above the target and preparing to dive . We heard a short burst of firing as Elrod tested his newly overhauled machine guns . Then there was silence , broken by a howl of rage from Duke Tharin . Now it was his turn to have his guns jam , and he devoted several seconds to a bitter summing up of machine guns in general and armorers in particular . " I 'm going down , anyway , " he ended . " I 'll feint a frontal attack and draw their fire while you come in from the side . " " Hell , " muttered Paul admiringly . " What 's the fool trying to do  --  be a hero ? " We heard the planes go roaring down . We heard Elrod 's machine guns chattering . We stopped holding our breath , then refueled our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and knew they were safely out of their dives and heading for home . They sounded querulous . Apparently of the four bombs dropped , only one had scored a hit . They spoke caustically of contrary bombs that would n't go where they were meant to , and Tharin swore he was going to dedicate his life after the war to perfecting a bomb that would find the mark for itself . He was fiddling with his jammed guns , and , mysteriously , they came to life . We heard a three-second burst , and a dry suggestion from Elrod , " If it 's Wake you 're shootin ' at , try to pot an armorer . " We were out to meet them as they bit the runway and taxied to the pits , They did n't leave their ships , but waited while a horde of armorers flung themselves on masse on the two planes , racking fresh bombs and feeding in new belts of bullets for the guns . The work was done at lightning speed , and the men sprang clear . Upsy-daisy ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 'll get her yet , sir ! " They flashed away , and this time the first word back from them was the news that victory had perched definitely on the banners of Wake Island . It was Tharin , surprised and excited , who reported our triumph . " Say , Walt , the Japs are high-tailing it with their fails between their legs ! " Those kids made four separate return trips from the airfield to the scene of action . They dived four times through a swirling hell of antiaircraft stuff and tilled out of it untouched . They sprayed n enemy deck with thousands of rounds f machine-gun ammunition . They ropped sixteen bombs all together , of which eight scored direct hits . And the end of it , a Japanese cruiser was ablaze from stem to stern , the flames kicking at her magazines and her crew going overboard in headlong flight . Tharin and Elrod called it a job . They came home , got their vocabularies under control and wrote decorous , seemly reports of their work . They did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war to sink a big Japanese warship or mention that they sank her piece meal with small bombs from land-based fighters . Except for the Duke and the Baron and Jimmy Devereux , who had won the first round of the battle by coolly holding his fire till he could send a gunboat and two destroyers to the bottom off Peacock Point , the decision might have gone the other way . The Jap cruiser certainly carried 6-inch guns , if not larger . It is quite conceivable that she would have stayed out of our range and combed the point with shells till , in the course of time , the battery was reduced to scrap . Then Jap landing parties would have attacked at widely separated spots . We shook hands all around , patted one an-other 's backs and our own , smirked a little and guessed we were n't the world 's worst fighters . We were confident now that we could hold out easily till relieved . Then , somewhere , a man started running . Somewhere a guy started waving his arms . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air . We had forgotten all about the daily raid , but it had n't forgotten us . It was noon , and what we had begun to call the Tojo Express was arriving right on schedule . We did n't wait to look at it . A few seconds of wild activity , and we melted into and under the scenery . Editor 's Note  --  This is the second or three articles by Colatte Sevier and Mr. Carnes .
