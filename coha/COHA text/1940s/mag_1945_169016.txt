Helping us pick the Man of the Year for our first January cover has become quite a tradition with subscribers-so you might be interested to learn that the whole thing began because the first week of 1928 was so dull . <P> No one had done anything newsworthy enough to put his picture on TIME 's cover , so somebody suggested we stop looking for a Man of the Week and pick a Man of the Year . This was an easy choice : Charles Augustus Lindbergh , who had soloed the Atlantic in only 33 hours and 39 minutes , was the hero of 1927 . <P> The Man of the Year idea caught on with a bang and , somewhat surprised , we decided to make it an annual event . The choice is in no way an accolade , nor a Nobel Prize for doing good . Nor is it a moral judgment . ( Al Capone was runner-up in riotous , bootleg 1928 . ) The two criteria are always these : who had the biggest rise in fame ; and who did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1942 ) or for worse ( like Stalin in 1939 , when his flop to Hitler 's side unleashed this worldwide war ) . <P> Fifteen different men have been chosen in 18 years-with one man picked three times and one man twice . <P> For 1928 we passed up Herbert Hoover , just elected President , because that year was the businessman 's year and Walter P. Chrysler was his symbol . When Business crashed in 1929 we passed by Hoover again , skipped over Explorer Byrd and Peace-Pacter Kellogg in favor of Owen D. Young , back from Paris with his plan for settling Europe 's troubles under his arm . <P> We turned down Bobby Jones , Joseph Stalin and Adolf Hitler ( who had just mobilized an unexpected 6,401,210 Nazi votes in Germany ) to make Mohandas K. Gandhi Man of 1930 . He was in jail when his selection was announced in TIME-for launching civil disobedience to get the British out of India . Next year was " a lean year for everybody , " as old Ramsay MacDonald put it : Man of 1931 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through 12 months which had meant breadlines in almost every other land ( Laval has n't had a good year since ) . <P> Franklin Roosevelt was picked in 1932-for winning a landslide election on a program of government economy . He was Man of the Year again in 1934 , but not for economy . ( That year Mussolini , Harry Hopkins and Huey Long also rated high in reader nominations . ) In 1933 came NRAdministrator Hugh Johnson-then flying high with the Blue Eagle . <P> Man of 1935 surprised some . We picked him because that year he had " carried his country into brilliant focus before a pop-eyed world . " He was Haile Selassie , Emperor of Ethiopia , Power of Trinity I , King of Kings , Elect of God , Light of the World , Conquering Lion of Judah . Man of 1936 was a woman-Wallis Warfield Simpson-and 1937 's choice was a couple : Generalissimo and Mme. Chiang Kaishek . <P> No one but Hitler could be Man of 1938 , but despite Hitler 's victories Winston Churchill proved himself Man of 1940 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1941 , after Pearl Harbor made him America 's sixth wartime president . And maybe you 'll remember that General George C. Marshall held the place last year , as the man who , more than anyone else , could be said to have " armed the Republic . "
