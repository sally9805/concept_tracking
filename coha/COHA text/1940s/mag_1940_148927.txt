In 1928 , Emmet Kennard Knott , a Seattle physicist and X-ray dealer , began to experiment with the effect of ultraviolet rays on the blood of dogs . In a local veterinary hospital he infected dogs with streptococci and staphylococci , withdrew a large amount of blood from their veins , irradiated it under an ultraviolet lamp , and put it back in circulation . Theoretically , the rays should have killed the germs . Instead , they killed the dogs . <P> One winter night , after several months of this kind of thing , stubborn Mr. Knott went down to the dog hospital with a doctor friend . The veterinary was busy , and sent Mr. Knott out to a shed to do his work . The dog was violently ill , the shed was cold , the light poor . So Mr. Knott irradiated only a small amount of blood , bundled up the dog , went home . <P> When he came back several days later , he was amazed to find that the dog was well . As it must on all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been giving his dogs too much irradiation ; ultraviolet rays in large amounts are deadly , in tiny amounts have natural curative power . Hotfoot to the dog pound for more dogs went Mr. Knott . <P> Scarcely had he settled to his task when his doctor friend begged him to come and irradiate his sister , who was dying of septicemia . Since the case was hopeless , the other physicians in the case consented . Mr. Knott irradiated the woman 's blood ; she recovered . Today she is strong and healthy , the mother of a husky child . <P> Dr. James Tate Mason , onetime president of the American Medical Association , heard about this case , encouraged Mr. Knott to go ahead with his experiments . But Dr. Mason soon died , and for five years Mr. Knott could find no doctors who were willing to try so radical a procedure . <P> In 1933 Dr. Virgil Kinney Hancock , noted Seattle obstetrician , began to try irradiation on hopeless streptococcic and staphylococcic bloodstream infections , with great success . Several years later , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Alfred Barrett of Manhattan . Last year , after they told him of several thousand successful cases , Dr. George Miley of Philadelphia 's Hahnemann Hospital began to put in full time on irradiation , working up case histories , preparing careful fever charts , blood-count tables . <P> Last week , to the A. M. A. meeting in Manhattan , Mr. Knott took his latest model irradiating machine , an oblong box of stainless steel , about two feet long . All week long , young Dr. Miley , aided by his associate Dr. Alfred Tuttle , demonstrated the machine to thousands of curious doctors , showed them a sheaf of experimental records from Hahnemann . Of 27 irradiated cases of septicemia ( bloodstream infection ) , said he , 22 recovered ; 71 irradiated cases of other bloodstream infections , including peritonitis and septic abortion , all recovered .
