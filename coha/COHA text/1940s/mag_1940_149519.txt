In December 1938 , Prince Fumimaro Konoye , then Premier of Japan , made a famous speech in which he proclaimed that Japan 's aim was the creation of a New Order in East Asia . Ostensibly this meant that the Orient should be for Orientals , working in cooperation with each other ; actually , it developed , it was to mean an Orient for the enjoyment of Japan . Recently , after a year and a half 's retirement , Prince Konoye returned to power at the head of a quasi-fascist Government . Like a poor but ambitious woman who cocks a new feather on an old hat , his new Government revised his threadbare slogan to read : New Order in Greater East Asia . <P> The tacitly understood boundaries of Greater East Asia include Japan , Manchukuo , Inner Mongolia , China , French Indo-China , Thailand , the Malay Peninsula , The Netherlands East Indies . The next step , about which many young Japanese speak frankly , is to delete the word East : establish Japanese hegemony over Greater Asia , meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategic problem of attaining the first of these objectives appears on the map which occupies the following two pages . <P> The military defeats of France and The Netherlands and the desperate extremity of Great Britain have recently caused Japan 's amateur imperialists to clamor for , and her professionals to prepare for , an adventure toward the equator . If the Japanese were to accomplish their much-vaunted New Order in this area , U. S. economy might be severely dislocated . Materials for a range of products all the way from tires to electric-light filaments , from tea to teak , from tin for canning to quinine for malaria , would become drastically scarce in the U. S. until substitutes could be produced in sufficient quantities . What the U. S. can do about it is limited by the fact that the East Indies lie some 2,000 miles outside the arc of effective U. S. operations . Furthermore , if the U. S. at this juncture tried to press home the recent halfhearted embargo on scrap iron , steel and oil , doing so would probably drive Japan to desperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternate supply of oil and some iron .
