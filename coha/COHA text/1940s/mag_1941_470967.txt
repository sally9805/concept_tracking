1926 I married an American . It seemed a pleasant thing to do at the time and not at all difficult . I still find it the most pleasant thing I know but I have had to revise my opinion about its difficulty . I was born in Canada . That was my first mistake . The second was in marrying an American . The third was the desire to live with my husband wherever his business took him . Apart from these three basic errors I have been a fairly average sort of person . Besides being born in Canada , I was educated there and abroad . My father occupied a responsible government post and my position was always more or less a semi-official one because of my mother 's early death . When the time came to marry , my fiance and I both wanted a quiet , simple ceremony . To escape the big and expensive wedding that seemed unavoidable at home we were married in New York . We continued to five in Canada , although my husband 's work took him frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks on end , sometimes for only a few days . Sometimes I would go with him or join him when a visit grew prolonged . Sometimes I remained in Canada . Sometimes we traveled back and forth by motor and sometimes by train . For five years we remained international grasshoppers and then , in the early thirties , we decided to make New York our home . Because my father was growing old and lonely , I made frequent tripsback to Canada to visit him , and always we tried to spend our summer holidays up north where we owned a lovely place in the Laurentians . During all those years I crossed the border as freely as I crossed the street . Oa the dozens of trips I made I always met the same courteous treatment from American border officials . Their questions were simple , almost perfunctory . Did I have anything to declare ? Where was I born ? Where was I going and for how long ? " I was born in Canada and I am returning to New York to join my husband . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was the invariable response . I liked living in the United States ; so much so that I felt compelled to write about it : the vitality of the country , its eager quality , its beauty , and enthusiasms fascinated me . By one of those happy accidents that happen nowhere but in New York , I fell into the hands of a kindly editor . With a generosity I have come to think of as peculiarly American , she took an interest in me . With luck and her careful guidance , my first book sold to the movies . Other books and stories followed . I found myself making a modest income , and my earnings , added to my husband 's , made feasible many things that had been no more than vague hopes before . One was to build ourselves an all-theyear-round house on our place in the Laurentians . Our idea was to have a very simple and practical place where I would spend the summers , and my hus- My indignation was unbounded . " I am the wife of an American , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openly . No one ever attempted to stop me . No one ever told me that I was entering the country illegally . I have been living here off and on for fifteen years ; for eight years permanently . I am self-supporting . I pay taxes . I have no wish to break the laws of the United States but I do want to be able to go to my place in Canada and return here as freely as I have always done . How can I get out of this mess ? " II There were only three ways in which my " position might be regularized ! ! The first was difficult and expensive ; my husband would have to find some Senator or Congressman who would introduce a private bill into Congress making me an American citizen . I was told that the customary cost was $5,000 in extra counsel fees . The second method was for my husband to petition the State Department to have his alien wife pre-examined for entry into the United States . What it meant was that I could go to Ellis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The advantage of pre-examination was that I should be absolutely certain of getting back in the United States . The great disadvantage was that it involved correspondence with the State Department ; and the State Department , I was told , was notoriously slow in answering letters . The third and last method was for me to apply to an American consul in Canada for entrance into the United States as a non-quota immigrant . ( I was non-quota on two counts , it seemed : as a native-born Canadian and as the wife of an American citizen . ) The attorney advised me to try both the second and third methods . He also urged me to find out all I could about the different American consulates up north . " A consul has absolute power to detide who can be admitted to this country , " he explained . " Try to pick the best one possible . Otherwise you may have a disagreeable time . " Whether my husband petitioned or I petitioned , I had to have a passport . Without a passport there would be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not be admitted to the United States . My lawyer thought that Canada had made some provision to care for orphaned nationals like myself and said he would look into the matter at once . In the meantime there were a number of documents which I had to have . I have the list as I wrote it down that morning . " But who wants all these things ? " I demanded . My lawyer explained that a consul has to satisfy himself that anyone applying for admission to the United States is entirely desirable from every conceivable point of view . " All these documents may be required and they may not be , " the attorney said . " There is no way of knowing , for one of the odd tricks about this game is that been published . After a long search an item was finally located . It mentioned the important fact that a daughter had been born to Mr. and Mrs. G. , my father and mother . The item also gave the name of the attending physician . For a brief interval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor had been dead some years . It began to look as if I should never succeed in getting myself even legally born . Then , by a stroke of luck , I found that the Archbishop who had christened me was still alive . Another exchange of letters followed , the old gentleman providentially remembered the occasion and , forty odd years after the event , had himself taken down to the Bureau of Vital Statistics to register my birth . The gods who sit in the consular offices could be satisfied at last . The search for a birth certificate began on June 7th . It was concluded on September 29th ! The correspondence , legal and personal , filled a good-sized file , for I have passed over the dozens of letters I exchanged with friends who had known me from childhood . Contemporaneously , I had been attending to numerous other chores . I wrote to the chiefs of police of the places I had lived , and obtained , for varying fees , statements that they had never heard of me . I had myself fingerprinted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any recorded crime . My marriage certificate was somewhat easier . Because I had been married in New York a duplicate was less troublesome to obtain . It took only about a week 's time , more than twenty telephone calls , five letters , a chat with the mayor 's private secretary , and a fee of three dollars . I had myself gone over by my doctor and was declared without contagious disease and generally as healthy as a horse . But such things as birth , marriage , and health certificates were simple and straightforward . Besides these , I had to furnish photostat copies of income-tax returns , royalty statements , affidavits of the value of the real estate I owned in Canada , statements as to my education and social standing , proofs of my affiliations with societies , including a letter from the head of the University which I have the honor to serve as a member of the Board of Governors . Those might seem sufficient references ? but apparently not . I had to produce also proof as to future earnings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also testimonials as to my good character and general dependability . For the record , I might note that each and every item required letters , telephone calls , interviews and , invariably , another meeting with my lawyer . I was not the only person in our family whose summer was given over to assembling documents . With the exception of health and marriage certificates , my husband had to furnish practically the same information . There was one difference : he had to provide his data twice over , once in support of my application and once in support of his own petition . Like myself , he had trouble with his birth certificate . It was unobtainable but he had been an officer in the United States Army and to receive a commission had had to furnish satisfactory proof of birth . This was on file with the Adjutant General of the War Department . Photostat copies were obtained but they were not sufficient for the Consul . And so my husband had to go to the trouble of getting new affidavits from the very same persons whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years before . But such irritations were commonplace rather than exceptional . In August , for example , after repeated inquiries from my lawyer , the State Department notified us that the documents accompanying my husband 's petition could not be located and would we submit a duplicate set forthwith . I thought of Alice in Wonderland and half expected the Red Queen to join us any moment . We met no one , however , but various clerks and officials , none of whom could do a thing for me because of " regulations . " Little by little we rose higher in the building until we finally reached a senior official . He listened to my story , thought for some time , and then called an assistant to him . " Take this lady upstairs to Mr. A. , " he said . " Ask him to watch her while she registers and is fingerprinted . When she has done so , ask him to write me a letter to that effect and sign it . Tell him to bring it down to me himself . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see me on your way out , " he said . Upstairs I was registered and fingerprinted and heard Mr. A. dictate a letter saying that he had seen these things accomplished . I called on the senior official again and curiously enough he dropped the letter just where my lawyer could pick it up and slip it in his briefcase . Apparently , this involved maneuver was the only way to place in my hands proof of regislration . The letter was duly photostated and sent on its way to Canada . In due course I received word that my papers appeared to be in order and that it would be proper for me to present myself at the Consulate in Canada any day ( except a legal holiday ) from Monday to Friday between nine A.M. and twelve noon . October was drawing to its close . The autumn leaves were falling and from the Laurentians came news of the first heavy frosts . All reasons for going to Canada having bang since been eroded from our lives , my lawyer suggested that I might as well postpone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department might yet get round to answering my husband 's petition to have me pre-examined . My attorney wrote again to Washington and telephoned Ellis Island . November arrived and still I waited . The middle of the month came and went . And then , finally , there came a moment when the whole preposterous business got on my nerves , " Let 's forget Washington and Ellis Island both , " I said , " I 'm going . " IV On November 18th , armed with my British passport , I set out for Canada . As the plane lifted from La Guardia Field I had an awful moment . Nine pounds of documents had preceded me . I knew there were influential friends on both sides of the border I could call on in an emergency . But I had heard so many stories of the things that could happen to entirely innocent , unobjectionable people that I was terrified that something might go wrong . Perhaps some document had been overlooked . . . perhaps some clerk might take a dislike to me as government clerks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . perhaps . . perhaps . . . At eight-fifteen the next morning I arrived outside the door of the American Consulate in a Canadian city . There were twenty persons ahead of me , standing in the corridor in a single line . By nine o'clock there were dozens of us . We all seemed to wear the same half-anxious , half-hopeful expression ? such as I imagine one would see to-day on the faces in the queues of Europe . But this was not Europe . This was no place more fearful than a corridor leading to the door of an American consular office in a Canadian city . The door finally opened . A young , well-groomed man stepped into the hall . " Good morning , " he said pleasantly . With one accord we flocked round him , clamoring to be heard . I was surprised to find myself screaming louder than anyone . " My name 's so and so , " I yelled . " The Consul 's expecting me . I have an appointment with him for nine o'clock . " " Quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you take the first chair over there ? " There were indignant mutterings from among the twenty who had I did . What next occurred verged on the miraculous . Mr. J. rose from his desk and smiled . He had read one of my books and liked it ! " This lady is her own employer , " he said . " Put her down as ' self-employed . " I crossed over to Mr. j. ' s desk . " I refuse to continue with this girl , " I said . " Not even to enter the United States should one have to submit to such behavior . " He was very nice about it . He apologized for the stenographer 's manners and finished the papers for me . I was taken to other officials , all of whom now treated me courteously . I was finally turned over to the doctor . He was a young man of good address and professional skill . The examination over , the nurse took me to Miss X. again . There was more questioning and more typing . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desk but Miss X. never referred to it . No new question was asked me . Beyond the medical examination and the presentation of my British passport nothing took place that I had n't been through before . Miss X. asked me to take a seat in the outer waiting room . My papers had been found to be in order and I was to receive my visa but there would be a slight delay . As I was leaving this office , a delightfully mannered gentleman greeted me . It was the American Consul himself . He recalled mutual friends who had been in touch with him about me . He hoped everything had gone satisfactorily . He wished me a happy sojourn in the United States . As I waited in the outer office for my final papers , a young housemaid sat near me , telling her beads with nervous fingers . " Hail , Mary , full of grace , the Lord is with thee . . . " she kept saying over and over again . Once she turned to me . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think they 'll let me in ? " The Scotch American reappeared with his wife and his solicitor . The lawyer was imploring his client to be less voluble . The Scot was angrier than ever : " I 'll be damned if I 'll keep quiet , " he shouted . " I 'm an American citizen and a taxpayer . I 'm one of the poor ignorant fools that supports this preposterous and abominable nonsense . " Inside the railing behind me two stenographers gossiped as they worked . One fragment of their conversation remains with me . " I 've written this dope three times , " one said . " Why the hell should I bother with him any more ? The man 's a sap and I 'm going to tell him no . " A young doctor , an applicant like myself , sat down beside me . He said he had to talk to someone because he was slowly going crazy . His case was just the opposite of mine . He was a Canadian who had married an American girl . Like myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had been at the Consulate three days . His wife was having a baby . His practice was being shot to pieces . He was trying to get a visa but nothing had happened , nothing was happening . A second man joined us and related a story about a girl , a Canadian friend of his , who had been married to an American in another part of the Dominion . She had been admitted to the States before her marriage and had met her husband there . For personal reasons they had been married in Canada , but to return to the U.S.A. for permanent residence as a married woman she had to have a visa . She presented herself at the local consulate ? not the one we were then in ? with her passport and her original papers of entry . The bridegroom , a doctor , explained that his wife was delicate and could not stand the heat . He was told that his wife would have to wait her turn . " Could no exception be made ? " the worried husband asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few hours ' waiting at the height of a July heat wave and the girl fainted . The consulate staff were annoyed and sent her home . She returned the next day with a trained nurse and the two they have n't been printed yet I 'll go down there and see them for myself . " But I shook my head . " You need n't bother , " I said . " Pm through . If the United States ever wants sue as a citizen they will have to come and get me . I 've spent six months doing all the American government demanded of me . I have spent over one thousand dollars in a decent effort to obey the laws of this country . But now I 've had enough . I 'm through . " Mr. Z. went on reading the sports page and that 's how it all ended . Not quite all , for two months later my husband received a notice from Ellis Island saying that I was to report there . His petition for pre-examination had been finally granted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not entitled to any feelings . As a non-quota immigrant it may not be any of my business what the attitude or behavior of American officialdom is toward its potential immigrants . But as the wife of an American , who has come to have a deep affection for this country and its people , I feel that I am under an obligation of friendship to let them know how they are being represented . And as a Canadian perhaps I can be granted one bewildered protest ; that is of course if half the " good neighbor " talk we hear so frequently is anything more than platform and microphone oratory . The President and the Secretary of State have expressed their devotion to the good neighbor policy so many , many times . I wonder if they know the extent to which it is honored in the breach . I wonder if they realize the terror that enters the heart and mind of an applicant for a passport visa to enter these United States . Such applicants are soon made aware that they are in the absolute power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to contempt , indifference , and negligence . They may be subjected to arbitrary decisions which seem as often to be guided by whim andprejudice as by common sense and reason . If an applicant gives the slightest trouble , if he begins to appear " difficult , " he may be penalized or browbeaten into docile obedience under the veiled threat of being denied admission to the country . And when I speak of applicants being terrified I am not referring to those tragic souls caught in Spain or Portugal to whom an American visa may mean the difference between life and freedom and the horrors of a concentration camp . I am referring to persons like myself ? commonplace , middle-of-the-road persons whose character and respectability can be readily ascertained from scores of other respectable citizens . Perhaps I could have used influence , but I chose to obey the laws of this country rather than evade them . The result was that I had to pay one thousand dollars for lawyer 's fees , traveling expenses , telephones , telegrams ( and an infinitude of other items ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived here eight years as the wife of an American citizen . In addition , I lost the best part of a summer 's work at a rather critical point in my professional career . It still seems to be a shocking , stupid waste of time , money , and nervous energy . I do n't know where the fault lies or who is to blame . I do know though that in the business world good public relations are considered a first essential of survival . In the hotel business the guest is always right . Department stores , the telephone company , oil and service stations are staffed with courteous , friendly , agreeable people with whom it is a pleasure to do business . These are commonplaces of Americ an democracy . Why should the American government , in its dealings with immigrants , offer such a shocking contrast ? I think that Americans ? the helpful , kindly , generous , democratic people who are so greatly in the majority ? should know that in their name exists an administrative cult that is as stupid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
