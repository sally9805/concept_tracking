The Razor 's Edge ( 20th Century-Fox ) dawdles away several million dollars trying to make a great philosopher out of W. Somerset Maugham and a great actress out of Gene Tierney . Result of all the costly , unsuccessful straining is an earnest , overlong , impressively glossy , frequently dull movie . Novelist Maugham remains an accomplished old storyteller who is not at his best as a camp-meeting evangelist . Miss Tierney is still a toothily pretty young woman who displays fancy clothes with far greater assurance than she displays simple emotions . <P> The movie tiptoes as respectfully close behind Maugham 's 90-day wonder* as if it were stalking Holy Writ . Tyrone Power , back in Hollywood after 3 years as a marine , is the introspective young man who returns from World War I full of questions about the spiritual meaning of life . Rather than marry Miss Tierney and settle down to bond-selling in the fleshpots of Chicago , he runs off to Paris to examine his troubled soul . Miss Tierney , plainly a non-spiritual type , sullenly marries wealthy John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yearns for Tyrone . <P> In the sluggishly melodramatic Paris sequences , Clifton Webb is an amusing old expatriate snob , Herbert Marshall plays Mr. Maugham himself and Anne Baxter is a frantically unhappy girl who takes to drink in low Apache dives . Elsa Lanchester is refreshingly expert in a tiny comedy bit . <P> Dragging the audience along in his search for spiritual peace , Tyrone eventually goes on a pilgrimage to deepest India , where he picks up an interesting yoga trick that will cure headaches . Against an improbable Himalayan backdrop , he also receives from a holy man a number of fine platitudes , including the one that gives the story its title ( " The sharp edge of a razor is difficult to pass over ; thus the wise say the path of Salvation is hard " ) . <P> Assigned the razor's-edge task of filming a story that was blatantly unsuitable for a big , star-spangled screen entertainment , Director Edmund Goulding ( Grand Hotel , Claudia ) did his thankless work with considerable taste and polish . <P> Pretentious thud that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applause for trying to be a movie with an Idea . The real trouble in this case : the movie technicians-including the director-are far too clever and too efficient for their material ; it has become dangerous to let them kick an Idea around-unless it is a very , very robust Idea . By the time 4.000 competent craftsmen have focused their cold lights on Mr. Maugham 's little sermon , pulled it through 89 dressy sets , photographed it tenderly from every possible angle and spiced it up with a thrilling musical background , it stands revealed as a rather small , shivering , indecently exposed banality . Hollywood 's cameras , always rudely frank about a misshapen nose or an inept gesture , have everlastingly proved that they can be equally ruthless and revealing with a fuzzy idea . <P> <P> - " The average age of a novel , " said Maugham , " is 90 days .
