A few hours after Franklin Roosevelt made his speech declaring undeclared sea warfare ( see p. 11 ) , trumpet fanfares interrupted German radio programs and an announcer read Germany 's answer : " Submarines in the North Atlantic attacked a large convoy ... of more than 40 ships . After heavy fighting , submarines have sunk , up to now , 22 steamers of 134,000 tons . . . . The enemy convoy is still being further attacked . " This was an answer not calculated to turn away wrath . It reminded Americans that the Battle of the Atlantic was still very real . Before long the Germans revised their claims for the kill upward to 28 merchant ships of 164,000 tons and three escorting warships . <P> The British answered this answer in two ways . They announced that a convoy , after struggles with inimical gales , submarines and planes , had reached England minus eight of its ships . If this was the same convoy ( which the British did not claim ) , the German retort discourteous was not quite so bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other British answer was action . In the Mediterranean the Fleet Air Arm and the R.A.F. caught and broke up a convoy . " Seven or eight vessels " were sunk , halted , or hurt . Earlier in the week the British had hit two ships in another convoy . Of the two British answers , this was by far the more effective . It underlined a significant claim in Winston Churchill 's cheerful speech to Parliament ( see p. 28 ) : " . . . Sinkings of British and Allied shipping by enemy action in July and August , added together , do not amount to much more than one-third of German and Italian tonnage we have sunk . . . . "
