Edward Kennedy ( " Duke " ) Ellington and Benjamin David ( " Benny " ' ) Goodman are the ablest U. S. jazz band leaders now shaking a stick . Both are hard-working and musicianly ; both are money-making veterans . Last week the Duke and Benny both made off-beat appearances . <P> &gt;Duke Ellington , with his 15-piece orchestra and two singers ( Ivie Anderson and Herbie Jeffrey ) , played for two and a half hours in Colgate University 's Memorial Chapel at Hamilton . N. Y. It was the first time that a major U. S. college had ever put a jazz band on its official concert course . Colgate made some pretence that the Duke 's performance was-ah-cultural . But to 1,450 students , faculty members and townspeople who crowded the chapel , no such excuse was necessary . The audience would have rocked the joint , had not the Colgate Maroon warned beforehand that stamping might jar loose the three-and-a-half-ton ceiling of the chapel . <P> &gt;Benny Goodman made a long-heralded appearance in Manhattan 's Carnegie Hall as clarinet soloist with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Major , Debussy 's First Rhapsody . No one should have been surprised . Trained in his youth by a Chicago Symphony clarinetist , Franz Schoepp , Benny Goodman can tootle with the two or three best in the world . Critics could find little fault with his playing of Mozart and Debussy-unless it was a slight excess of refinement and dignity . <P> Benny Goodman wants to commission clarinet works by such contemporaries as Prokofieff , William Walton , Aaron Copland . But last week he was busy with his new orchestra . When he was ill last summer with sciatica , for which he underwent an operation at the Mayo Clinic , Goodman disbanded his men , starting rumors that he was through . The new 15-man band , now to be heard on Columbia records , has a new , richer style , which Benny Goodman says is not swing . But it is still Goodman .
