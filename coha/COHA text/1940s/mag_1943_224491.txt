FORTUNE in its December issue , pictures an almost fabulously frozen postwar future for the average citizen . Some of the possibilities : Manufacturers expect to put electric refrigeration into practically every one of the nation 's 40,000,000 housing units ( v. <P> 19,400,000 installed by 1942 ) . <P> They also dream about putting two refrigerating units in a lot of homes-the second one a " home freezer . " Food can now be cooked , frozen and reheated with no effect on taste . <P> This fact has caused some restaurateurs to make startling plans for national house-to-house distribution of centrally cooked foods after the war . A Chicago freezer manufacturer talks glibly of delivering frozen delicacies from New Orleans ' famed Antoine 's , is " sure the day will come when housewives can carry on for weeks without really cooking anything . " Concludes FORTUNE calmly " Eight hundred million beefsteaks a year might be broiled in or near Chicago , quick frozen , and eaten any time from a day to six months later , anywhere from Maine to Mexico .
