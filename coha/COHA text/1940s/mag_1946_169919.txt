The iron curtain across Europe parted a little last week . Escorted by Russian officers , seven U.S. newspapermen , among them TIME Correspondent Jack Fleischer , toured rich , lightly war-damaged Thuringia , southwest of Berlin , in the Russian zone . When they returned to Berlin , Fleischer reported this conviction-that the goal of Russian occupation policies is a socialized Germany . <P> Politics . The Russians , Fleischer cabled , are fighting for socialism by shotgunning the Social Democratic party into a wedding with the Communists . Politicians , German officials , Russian officers conceded that for all practical purposes the merger had already taken place . The leaders were acting in concert . The rank &; file had not been consulted . <P> Blandly the venerable , white-Vandyked Dr. August Proelich , Social Democratic leader and onetime Prime Minister of Thuringia , told the startled newsmen : " I do n't believe it is wise to permit the rank &; file to vote on such an important issue when an organization is as young as the present Social Democratic party . " <P> Propaganda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reporters listened to a nearsighted Communist professor , who might have mistaken his visitors for Soviet newsmen , lecture a training class for new teachers . He argued that Britain and the U.S. had " only formal democracy , " struck at the British Labor Government , told the class : " Democracy is not the goal but the way to achieve the goal . As I have repeatedly said , the goal is socialism . " <P> Production . The nearsighted professor 's ideas , in muted form , were everywhere in Thuringia . Farmers were tackling the problems of shortages , tractors , horses , oxen , fertilizers and seeds , not individually , but in collective groups and according to plan . Workers ' advisory councils functioned in the factories , conferring with commercial and technical directors on all operations . <P> Proudly Thuringia 's potbellied Prime Minister , Dr. Rudolf Paul , told the newsmen that the province 's industrial establishments , operating at 30% of normal last July , were now at 91% . Fleischer saw some of them . <P> The Bayerische Motoren Werke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning out eight passenger cars a day against a prewar total of 45 . August production goal is 250 cars : 200 for Russian reparations , 50 for Soviet and German zonal administration . <P> The Bessler textile factory in Gera , managed by 46-year-old Willi Huhne , who held the same job through the Nazi era , was turning out from 2.4 to 2.6 million yards of cloth as against 3 million yards in prewar years . Sadly Huhne watched a machine turning out cloth with Stalin 's picture on it , said he still favored private enterprise . <P> Wherever their cars stopped , reported Fleischer , a crowd of Germans collected . Some grumbled against the Russians , asked when the Americans were coming back . Said one Hausfrau : " The sunshine left with the American troops . " But it was hard to see what they had to complain about . Cabled Fleischer :
