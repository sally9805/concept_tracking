For half a century , New Orleans ' fantastic Mardi Gras balls were strictly for the upper crust . Nobody without money , blue blood , or both gained membership in the secret men 's clubs or " krewes " * which staged them . Before 1900 there were only five clubs : Comus , Momus , Twelfth Night , Rex and Proteus . They culled guest lists with pernickety care , asked only the fairest of debutantes to serve as carnival queens . But times changed . The socially ambitious began forming their own krewes . <P> In 1928 New Orleans had 16 Mardi Gras balls . In 1946 there were 36 . This year , a record-breaking total of 49 are being held . Last week , with Carnival Day ( Shrove Tuesday ) fast approaching , New Orleans ' social whirl had assumed the proportions of a maelstrom . <P> Everybody Dance . The new krewes cut across a dozen social strata . There are Italian krewes , Irish krewes , German krewes . There are krewes for college men , businessmen , professional men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are even krewes for women . Each seemed determined that its ball should be as lavish as the next . Queens of new krewes were not always debutantes , but all-like pretty Shirley Ray Toups ( see cut ) , who reigned over the Bards of Bohemia ball-were gorgeously gowned . <P> New or old , Mardi Gras balls all conform to a traditional pattern . They open with a tableau or pageant , followed by a grand march led by a costumed king and queen . Then masked members of the krewe dance with women summoned from the audience . Finally formally clad guests who have been watching from the galleries join in the dancing too . <P> This Oriental splendiferousness is extremely expensive . A newly formed Italian-American krewe spent $50,000 for this year 's ball ; the cost of all 49 would total half a million dollars . Supper parties for 49 carnival queens-one of whom wore a costume worth $3,500-would come to another $350,000 . Merchants guessed that New Orleans women would spend three or four million dollars for clothes and trips to beauty parlors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Next week all of New Orleans will quit work , put on a-million dollars ' worth of costumes , and spill noisily into the streets . There will be 13 parades with bands , torchlights , and scores of magnificent floats . On Carnival Day a million people will jam along Canal Street , jostle , throw confetti , sing , and , quite possibly , get more than slightly tight . <P> For many a New Orleans citizen there will be little rest even after all this uproar quiets down . It takes a year to plan a Mardi Gras , and 1949 would be along before you could say Comus Momus . <P> &lt;footnote&gt;*Old English for " crew . " &lt;/footnote&gt;
