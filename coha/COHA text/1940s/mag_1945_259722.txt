In a Chicago department store , a couple found a tricycle for their son 's Christmas . But they balked at the price : $47.50 . While they discussed the matter , a shabbily-dressed man pulled out a roll of bills , bought the tricycle , commenting loudly : " You ca n't take it with you , brother . " <P> Most Americans seemed to agree with the loud man . In stores from coast to coast , they bought anything that was for sale , in the last splurge of Christmas buying , boosted retail sales to the highest ever . <P> The Detroit branch of Saks Fifth Avenue could not get enough $5,000 mink coats to satisfy the demand . Other big sellers around the country : " Plenty of Nothing " black lace panties for $25 , alligator handbags for $150 , negligees for $65 . <P> Despite acute shortages of hard goods , and shoddy merchandise in general , sales were 10 to 15% higher than last year . Gimbel Brothers , Inc. , reported record sales in its eleven stores of more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manhattan 's R. H. Macy &; Co. passed the $1,000,000 mark for the third time this month ( fourth time in Macy 's history ) . San Francisco 's Emporium , which did an $18,000,000 business in 1941 , will top $36,000,000 this year . <P> But even these figures did not fully reflect the wild spending of the nation 's buying spree . Said one Los Angeles retailer : " God knows what would happen if we could get everything we could sell . "
