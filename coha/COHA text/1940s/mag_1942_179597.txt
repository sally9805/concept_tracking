Night raids on Germany were not enough . The R.A.F. had found daylight raids both necessary and feasible . Necessary because the wait for light cloud-covered bombing nights grew too long while the sands of the Red army trickled away and shipping off the U.S. took a terrible licking . Feasible because Britain 's newest four-motored bombers , snub-nosed Lancasters , could get up enough speed , carrying several tons of bombs , to raid Germany and return with conservative losses . On three successive days last week Lancasters and slower , longer-ranged Sterlings swept over the Ruhr to paste steel mills , factories , electric plants and other industries that feed Hitler 's armies . Bombers flying singly made the first two raids ; a mass of bombers in formation made the third . <P> The industrial wellsprings that supply the German army in Russia were targets ; but the raids were part &; parcel of the Battle of the Atlantic . Since March , when U-boat marauding in the western Atlantic grew intense , the R.A.F had blasted a pattern of destruction through German submarine-building cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among them were Augsburg and Cologne ( diesel engines ) , Essen ( plates and torpedo tubes ) , Emden and Bremen ( assembly yards ) , Warnemnde ( U-boat training base ) , Wilhelmshaven and St. Nazaire , France ( operational bases ) . <P> The Nazis were known to have dispersed their U-boat industry throughout the Reich and occupied territory to evade the R.A.F. , breaking up such pre-war building centers as Hamburg , Kiel , Bremen . Relentlessly the R.A.F. has searched out new plants and plastered them with explosives . <P> But the U-boat problem still was far , far from licked .
