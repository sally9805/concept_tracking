The only sound near the top of 10,000-ft . Mount Alagi one morning last week was the chink of a chisel on stone-two workmen were carving a name into a crude headstone . Most of the graves were marked only by rough wooden crosses , hacked from ammunition boxes ; beside each cross was a half-buried wine bottle , with the deceased 's identification papers crammed in . The workmen , glad to be alive , chipped somberly among the graves of men who had done their brave best . <P> A tall young man stepped into the sunlight from the cavernous door of Fort Toselli above the unfinished cemetery . He was Prince Amadeo di Savoia , Duke of Aosta , Governor General of Italian East Africa , Viceroy of Ethiopia , and he had spent the night all alone in this echoing fort deep in the mountains of the Empire Rome had sent him to rule . <P> His 7,000 Italian troops , harried from position to position by the British all spring , were a mixed lot to look at . There were aviators who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had swum ashore from battered battlecraft , Alpini swinging their mountain picks , Bersaglieri with un-cocky cock feathers on their steel helmets . <P> They had all marched down the mountain the day before to surrender to the British . <P> The British had let them march down carrying their weapons : a tribute to the stout hearts which even the enemy knew they had shown . <P> The Duke walked slowly down to the patch of graves . He looked at the letters the soldiers were chiseling : Volpini , a friend . The Duke took off his hat and bowed his head . <P> He had spent so many years hoping and groping for a world of reason and self-respect . As a boy he had made many friends on the playing fields of Eton . As a 17-year-old soldier he was decorated for valor in World War I. Then he had worked hard as an agent in the expansion of the Empire , in the Congo and in Libya , where he sadly disapproved of General Rodolfo Graziani 's ruthlessness . At home in Italy he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ethiopia he wanted to simplify the Italianate bureaucracy along British colonial lines , and just before assuming his duties in 1937 he visited his old friends in England . <P> Then war came . When the British drive began last winter he saw the hopelessness of the situation ; his heart was not in fighting his friends . Month ago he asked his boss Benito ( " War is the Normal State of the People " ) Mussolini whether he might make peace . He was ordered to continue . And so for a futile month he did his best and his men fought and died . This was the end of Aosta 's young hopes . <P> Amadeo of Aosta stooped , laid the bare palm of his hand flat on the soil of the Empire which was no longer his to rule , stood again , and walked quickly down to the British staff car waiting for him .
