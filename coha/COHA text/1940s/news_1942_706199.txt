txt Mayor La Guardia declared yesterday that the question of a fare increase on transit lines owned and operated by the city was strictly a local issue in which the Legislature should not interfere . " I would resent any interference from Albany , " the Mayor said in an interview at City Hall , commenting on pending bills that would require a referendum vote of approval before any fare rise could be made effective . One such bill introduced recently by Senator John J. Dunnigan , Bronx Democrat , was reported to have strong support 1 among both the Democratic and Republican members of the Legislature from New York City . The Mayor 's remark on the pending bills was made after he had been asked to comment on the proposal recently made by the Committee of Fifteen , headed by Paul Windels , former Corporation Counsel , recommending a fare rise on the subway and elevated lines on the basis of two rides for 15 cents , using tickets or tokens , or a single ride for 10 cents . Question of Policy Seen " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the proposal . " There have been plenty of higher fare proposals in the past . It is just a simple matter - of arithmetic . The lines cost so much to run , so much to support and they bring in so much revenue . The question is whether the difference , the deficit , should be carried in the budget or made up out of increased revenues . It is strictly a local question for the city itself to answer . It is a question of policy that must be settled . " The Mayor then commented on the referendum proposals pending in Albany and indicated that such a referendum vote might be of value under some circumstances . " I can see where a referendum might help in a year in which a Mayor is being elected , " he said , " but it should not be held in a year when a Governor is being elected . Nor is this a State matter . If a referendum is desired there are ways to have one without interference from Albany . The City Council can provide for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAYOR DECLARES I Would Resent , Interference From Albany , ' He Says of Referendum Bills DECISION ' ON MERITS ' SEEN But La Guardia Refuses to Give Opinion on Proposals of ? Windels Committee FARE RISE IN CITY HELD LOCAL ISSUE // or orie may be obtained through petition of qualified voters . " The unification law , under which the citx became owner and opertor of its present transit network , placed sole power and responsibility for any change in the rate of fare in the hands of the Board of Estimate , the Mayor noted , recalling that efforts to subject to referendum the plan itself or the rate of fare were rejected by the Legislature in 1940 . The Mayor 's attention was called to the estimate of a $35,000,000 rapid taansit defict for the coming fiscal year , made by the Committee of Fifteen . " I 'd rather take Mr. Delaney 's figures , " he said , referring to John H. Delaney , chairman of the Board of Transportation . " We do n't have to rely on outside estimates . We can figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fare rise , the Mayor indicated , now can be considered on its merits . In the past , he said , there was no division of opinion on the fare issue , because " every one was , politically speaking , for the five-cent fare , regardless of their intellectual viewpoint on the question . " Although the Mayor throughout the interview refrained from voicing an opinion on the merits of the plan proposed by the Committee of Fifteen , he did indicate strongly that the city would need every cent of additional revenue that it could get and that his mind still was open on the fare question . " We have n't unlimited taxing powers , " he said . " Budget appropriations for the current fiscal year will have to be pared . In ? times like these expenses of government always run higher than usual and revenues drop . " Last year the Mayor , discussing the need for additional transit facilities , hinted strongly in his annual message to the City Council that they could not be obtained unless a higher fare was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the obstacle of Federal priority requirements on materials has made it doubtful that such facilities could be constructed even if the necessary funds were available . In his message to the City Council two weeks ago the transit problem was not mentioned , the message being devoted almost entirely to the war situation . The plan proposed by the Committee of Fifteen was opposed by the American Bureau of Urban Transportation , 274 Madison Avenue , whose director and counsel is Harry S. Fischer , formerly an assistant counsel for the Transit Commission . Mr. Fischer predicted that adoption of the committee 's proposal , which he termed ill-considered , vague and unsupported by evidence , would result soon in a flat 10-cent fare on all transit lines in the city , including those privately operated . Mr. Fischer noted that the membership of the committee included no transit experts , that the plan gave no rational formula for future readjustments of the fare , especially downward ; that it failed to point out , when referring to higher fares in other large American cities , the fact that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twenty-five listed had subways . Until a scientific plan is brought on for consideration , Mr. Fischer said , the present rate of fare should be maintained . Approval of the committee 's plan was voiced by the Chamber of Commerce of the Borough of Queens in a letter sent to the Mayor by its president , Arthur A. Johnson , who is a member of the committee .
