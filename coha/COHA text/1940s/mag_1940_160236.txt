When the American Federation of Musicians elected James Caesar Petrillo its president ( TIME , June 24 ) , U. S. radio and phonograph men thought nervously of Chicago . As longtime boss of the Chicago musicians ' local , Jimmie Petrillo has nourished a violent and magnificent dislike for anything that keeps his musicians from getting jobs . Or , at least , from getting pay checks . <P> Chicago was a pioneer with the " standby " system , by which outside union men playing in its radio stations must either join the union local or pay a thumb-twiddling local musician to stand by . Jimmie Petrillo forbade Chicago men to make phonograph records which might be broadcast . He saw to it that political campaign trucks resound with live musicians , not recordings . When a giant panda was to be welcomed by a troop of Chinese Boy Scout buglers , Petrillo demanded that eight union men be hired as well . Italian as were his sympathies , he hit the ceiling when the Italian Consul arranged for amateurs to play at an Italian celebration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office as A. F. of M. president , Jimmie Petrillo was laying about him with Chicago vigor . In an attempt to bring two radio stations to heel , he cracked the whip over the three major networks . The stations were St. Paul 's KSTP ( NBC affiliate ) , Richmond 's WRVA ( CBS ) . Each was embroiled in a local musicians ' strike , because it declined to pay a minimum yearly sum , or guarantee a minimum number of jobs , to local musicians , whether needed or not . <P> Most union musicians on the radio are paid by networks or sponsors . But many of Boss Petrillo 's men play without extra pay in the dance bands picked up , usually after 11 p.m. , in hotels and nightclubs , and fed to the networks as " remotes . " Last week , after NBC and CBS refused to deprive KSTP and WRVA of these remotes , Boss Petrillo instructed dance bands not to make such broadcasts . MBS came under the ban when it helpfully piped its remotes to the other networks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead of their accustomed Gene Krupa , Eddy Duchin , Tommy Dorsey , et al. , a new crop of studio musicians-trios , quartets , unknown bands , variety shows . No one liked this much , but at week 's end no one had moved to break the deadlock .
