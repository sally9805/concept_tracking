The U.S. has a lily boom , and a brand-new industry . On the West Coast , in Louisiana and Florida , people who never grew anything in their lives are now raising bulbs . The reason : the war cut off the 22 to 25 million lily bulbs which the U.S. <P> imported every year from Japan , which virtually had a world monopoly . By last week the price of lily bulbs had shot up from 10 to $1 and $1.10 . <P> Typical of those busily sprouting bulbs into a big business is Tony Cefalu ( pronounced sefi-allo ) , 50 , a roly-poly , Sicilian-born ex-tavernkeeper . Like most of the others , Tony is growing the Croft , a white , sturdy , strong-stemmed Easter lily that multiplies at the rate of 150 bulbs from one bulb a season , will grow 20,000 to the acre . Although now well on his way to becoming the Lily King of the North west , Tony almost muffed his chance at the throne . <P> In 1940 he bought six Croft lily bulbs for 60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortune . Tony was a forgetful windowsill gardener ; he put the bulbs in coffee cans , forgot to water them and the plants withered . Disgusted , Tony threw the bulbs across the street into an empty lot . Later he found them revived among the weeds . He poked them into the ground between garlic plants in his garden because " garlic keeps da boogs away . " Next season he was rewarded with 41 bulbs and bulblets worth $4.10 . Then Tony heard the cash register ring . <P> In 1941 , he cleared two acres of jack pine and brush , near Grays Harbor , Washington lumber port , reinvested his bulbs . By 1943 he had 10,000 , will harvest 50,000 this year . He will sell 10,000 to nurserymen at from 20 to $1 each ( eight different grades ) and replant 40,000 . <P> No Croft scoffer now , Tony looks with disdain at a " motor villa " he also owns . " Viva Tony , " he shouts , " two more years da bulbs , you can have da joint . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of Agriculture estimates this year 's lily-bulb crop at no more than 3,000,000 . At the present rate of expansion it would take about five years , with careful cultivation , to meet the demand , and bring prices down . Even then , bulb growers believe that Japan will never regain her monopoly of the U.S. market .
