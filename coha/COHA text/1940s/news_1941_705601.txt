txt In Defense of Norman Thomas Every now and then there pop up in various parts of the country groups of former Socialists announcing themselves to be " Social Democrats , " renouncing socialism and denouncing Norman Thomas . The latest of these mavericks to receive considerable publicity came from California , but their complaint is the same as that of the New York group  --  i. e. , that Norman Thomas in his fight against our active participation in the war is betraying the tradition of Eugene Victor Debs . Now , I happen to have known Deb* , I was once jailed for speaking for his candidacy and I have written his only full-length biography , and I am here to say that Norman Thomas is speaking the language that Debs would have talked had he been here today . Because he spoke out against our participation in the last war Debs was put into Atlanta Penitentiary . It takes courage to take that same stand today , and no one , not even " Social Democrats , " will deny that Thomas has courage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Socialists who have stuck by their guns but of hundreds of thousands of nonparty members who now regret that they did not vote for him at the last election .
