txt " Why , if there is such a huge surplus of potatoes that all this good , wholesome food has to be dumped at its source , do we  --  here . in the city  --  have to pay as much as 55 cents for a measly little 15-pound hag ? " That 's the $64-and-up question which today tops the list in many , households , despite the hundreds of times the answers have been given . These answers  --  Federal subsidies and Government support prices  --  just do n't put potatoes on the dinner table , consumers retort heatedly , in spite of all the plans are supposed to do for the potato growers . " There 's something rotten somewhere , " they cry , " and it is n't only potatoes ! " Branded ' Disgrace ' " The most disgraceful situation that the food industry has been faced with , that such a price-support program should be carried on at a time when the wholesale price of that commodity is so high that there is absolutely no justification for holding it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Massachusetts Retail Grocers and Provision Dealers Association . " There is no justification for grocers having to pay up to DO cents a peck for potatoes at a time when we see pictures of food being dumped in such tremendous quantities , " he added . His position as a representative of the corner grocery which has to charge consumers the current high prices for spuds is backed in the potato-growing State of Maine by its Governor , Horace A. Hildreth , and by Lee C. Good , Executive Councilor and former Legislator from Aroostook County . Federal Method ' Hit Both deplored the payment of big Federal subsidies to growers who had to dump surpluses . Mr. Good advocated Federal control of production , instead of support prices ; declaring that potatogrowing states would not co-operate in State control programs . " We need to be told ' how much to produce for the market so that we wo n't have too much or tuo little , " he asserted . Any lowering of wholesale or retail , prices at this time  --  in addition to creating still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices out of potatoes altogether , those close to the markets say . Along with this current situation of extreme surpluses , they point out , the consuming public has been buying about 15 per cent fewer potatoes than ever before , using more fruits and vegetables , and consuming more potato substitutes . Growers , they add , will simply have to cut their acreages still further . Wartime Law Cited During the war , the agricultural experts point out , in order to obtain potatoes for the armed forces in sufficient quantities gto meet the greatly increased demands , the Government had to get behind the growers and guarantee a price that would induce the farmers to plant spuds . That support price , under the law , . must continue for two years after the war emergency is over , to give the farmer sufficient time to readjust himself . The nation still is within that two-year period following the end of the emergency , and the support prices under the law , must still be paid by the Government . Meantime , it looks as though Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have to face the present high price for spuds , in spite of the millions of bushels that have been dumped this winter .
