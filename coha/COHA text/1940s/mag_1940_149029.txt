One of the most popular men in Washington is red-faced , white-haired John J. Dempsey , New Mexico 's lone Representative in the House . Onetime water boy on a railroad , hard-working Jack Dempsey fought his way to success , then , with the profits of some Oklahoma oil , went to New Mexico to retire . Instead , he got into politics up to his neck . He first entered Congress in 1935 . In six years , he saw 99 of his bills become law-a legislative record . <P> Last winter , the Senate passed Hatch Bill II , prohibiting political activity by State employes who are paid in whole or in part from Federal funds . Many a Senator voted for it , for the simple , political reason that he was confident it would never pass the House . Experts gave the bill no better than a 10-to-1 chance . At this point scrappy Jack Dempsey stepped in , told his friends : " I 'm going to pass that bill . " <P> The Hatch Bill never had the support of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the House . Its most formidable opponent was Texas ' old , respected Hatton Sumners , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , where the bill reposed . The Committee , horrified by the bill 's proposed reforms , held a secret ballot , announced a vote of 14-to-10 to table the measure . Congressman Dempsey thereupon raised Congress ' roof by announcing that 13 members told him afterwards they had voted for the bill . He started a petition to extricate the bill from the Committee . Embarrassed Congressmen stayed away from Mr. Dempsey 's petition in droves . Back he went to the Committee members , wheedled , cajoled and bullied them for almost a month . Finally , by an open vote , the Hatch Bill passed the Judiciary Committee , 16-to-8 . <P> The fight was not yet won . Dempsey had to get the measure through the Rules Committee before it could reach the floor of the House . To Rules Committee members he said : " I 'm a member of this committee and I want you men to give me this rule just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ votes , and at last the bill was sent to the House . There Hatton Sumners made a final , vitriolic attack on it . With unfading zeal Mr. Dempsey stuck to his guns . The bill passed , 243-to-122 . At week 's end the Senate concurred , without debate . The final bill as approved by both Houses limited expenditure by a political party to $3,000,000 in a single year , limited single campaign contributions to , $5,000 , prohibited fund-raising devices such as the Democratic yearbook . As soon as the President signs it , the bill will become a law . <P> Having jacked his legislative score to an even 100 bills , Jack Dempsey , hale &; hearty at 61 , indicated that he would leave the House , run for the Senate in the fall . His opponent : New Mexico 's Senator Dennis Chavez , whose relatives were once involved in a WPA scandal ( they were later tried and acquitted ) , thoroughly disapproved of the Hatch Bill from the start .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
