Like Russian Ambassador Maisky , Norwegian Minister Erik Colban was kept busy in London last week hot-footing it around to the Foreign Office to protest fresh indignities suffered by his country at the hands of Great Britain , in her course of trying to throttle Germany . British aircraft had flown over Norwegian territory scouting for German ships using Norway 's coastal sea lanes . British warships had entered Norwegian water to sink German ships . One of them fired a shot across a German 's bow and the shell landed ashore , albeit unexploded , near the Varhaug railway station on Norway 's southwestern tip . Norwegians muttered that if British intrusions did not stop , Norway might stop leasing much-needed tankers and freighters to Great Britain . <P> Blandly the British Foreign Office took note of Minister Colban 's protests , but did nothing about them . Last month Britain announced she would disregard the juridical role of the World Court at The Hague . Instead , she now recognizes the rule of reprisal : if Germany breaks a law , Britain will break one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torpedoing even neutral merchant ships without warning , but Britain let it be understood that she would not be stopped by technicalities of international law so long as no neutral lives were endangered . And last week the Allies ' chief spokesman to neutrals , Winston Churchill , phrased Britain 's new policy toward Norway and others thus artfully : " When we are asked to take as a matter of course interpretations of neutrality which give all the advantage to the aggressor and inflict all the disadvantages upon the defenders of freedom , I recall a saying of the late Lord Balfour : ' This is a singularly ill-contrived world , but not so ill-contrived as that ! ' " <P> So British destroyers , heavy and light , and cruisers and submarines too , continued prowling in force along the three-mile sea limit of Norway , Sweden and Denmark . Germany as well as these neutrals was made to feel that they would not hesitate to dash in if they sighted a German warship . One German submarine , a 250-ton U-21-type with a boyish crew of 28 aboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she went aground off Mandal , Norway 's southernmost town . Her captain presented a huge sausage to the first Norwegian fisherman who came along , asked him to pull the U-boat free . The fisherman , after consuming the sausage and praising its quality , notified the nearest naval station and the Nazis were all interned at Horten , with a fine show of strict Norwegian neutrality . <P> &gt; Norwegians fumed last week when the motorship Cometa , bound from Bergen to neutral Argentina , was reported torpedoed by a U-boat right in Kirkwall , Britain 's contraband control port in the Orkney Islands . The Admiralty quickly denied responsibility , said the sinking occurred " hundreds of miles " from Kirkwall in the North Sea . <P> &gt; Despite the Allies ' tighter grip on the Skaggerak and Kattegat , into Kiel last week steamed the German prison ship Altmark , safe home after being grounded and robbed of her prisoners by the British destroyer Cossack in Jsingfjord ( TIME , Feb. 26 ) .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
