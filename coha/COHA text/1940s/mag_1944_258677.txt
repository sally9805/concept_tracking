Common Sense has published a remarkable document - five letters exchanged between Mohandas K. Gandhi ( then a political prisoner in the Aga Khan 's palace at Poona ) and India 's Viceroy , Viscount Wavell . In his foreword Newsman Louis Fischer , who made the letters public , claimed that Gandhi 's recent conciliatory proposal to Wavell for Indian independence ( TIME , Aug. 28 ) was a " sequel " to this correspondence . That might or might not be true . But as historic and human documents , the letters were unique . Each of the correspondents was an arch-type-Gandhi of the saintly man turned political crusader , Wavell of the worldly , disciplined , cultured proconsul . Each was highmindedly and absolutely convinced of the rightness of the cause he typified . The result epitomized the present phase of the problem of India and Britain-deadlock tempered , in this case , by Gandhi 's and Wavell 's deep humanity : <P> Gandhi to Wavell . <P> Dear Friend : <P> Although I have not had the pleasure of meeting you I address you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked upon by representatives of the British Government as a great , if not the greatest , enemy of the British . Since I regard myself as a friend and servant of humanity including the British , in token of my good will I call you , foremost representative of the British in India , my " friend . " . . . <P> I distinguish between the defeat of Japanese arms and Allied victory . The latter must carry with it deliverance of India from a foreign yoke . The spirit of India demands complete freedom from all foreign dominance and would therefore resist the Japanese yoke equally with the British or any other . . . . British promises for the future are valueless in the face of a world struggle in which the fortune of all nations and therefore of humanity is involved . Present performance is the peremptory need of the moment if the war is to end in world peace and not be the preparation for another war bloodier than the present . . . . <P> I have done . I thought that if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , nothing should deter me from sharing my deepest thoughts with you . <P> Wavell to Gandhi . <P> Dear Mr. Gandhi : <P> I thank you for your letter of February 17 . ... <P> I expect you have seen in the paper reports of a speech I made to the Legislature on the same day on which you wrote that letter . This states my point of view and I need not repeat what I said then . I enclose a copy for your convenience if you wish to read it . <P> I take this opportunity to express to you deep sympathy from my wife and myself at the death of Mrs. Gandhi . We understand what this loss must mean to you after so many years of companionship . <P> Gandhi to Wavell . <P> Dear Friend : <P> ... At the outset I send you and Lady Wavell my thanks for your kind condolences on the death of my wife . Though for her sake I have welcomed her death as bringing freedom from living agony , I feel the loss more than I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary . It was in 1906 that by mutual consent and after unconscious trials we definitely adopted self-restraint as the rule of life . To my great joy this knit us together as never before . ... I now come to your address which you delivered before the Legislature and of which you have kindly sent me a copy . . . .
