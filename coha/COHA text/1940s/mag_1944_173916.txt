To the A.P . ' s Joseph Morton , King Mihai last week told the story of his dramatic palace coup which flip-flopped Rumania from the Axis to the Allied camp ( TIME , Sept. 4 ) . <P> Seven times since early 1942 the young King and his young aides had planned to overthrow old hatchet-faced Marshal Ion Antonescu , the Nazi-loving dictator . Seven times they had to call off the plot . <P> On Aug. 23 , after a late lunch , Mihai sent for Antonescu . The dictator , following his practice of keeping the King waiting , arrived an hour late . He left his bullet-proof automobile , with glass an inch thick , a gift from Hitler , in the courtyard . Several other automobiles loaded with armed bodyguards parked behind it . <P> The King waited in his palace study . <P> Beside him was his aide-de-camp , now Premier , General Constantin Sanatescu . <P> In an adjoining room sat his Marshal of the Court , Baron Ion Mocsonyi-Styrcea , his good friend , now Foreign Minister , Grigore Niculescu-Buzesti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , an officer and three members of the King 's Palace Guard waited his signal . <P> When Antonescu came in , he and the King shook hands . Then - <P> Mihai : I have a wire from the front and the situation looks disastrous . What are you going to do about it ? Are you or are you not going through with the armistice ? <P> Antonescu : I am going through with it but there are some conditions to be met . I want a guaranty from the Allies that they will land in Rumania and guarantee it for us against the Russians . <P> Mihai : That is so absurd it is not worth discussing . How do you expect the Allies to guarantee us against their own Allies ? <P> Antonescu : I will not move . If necessary I will retire to Transylvania and fight there . <P> Mihai : You will have to make an armistice or resign . This time you have gone too far . <P> Styrcea and lonnitiu , both excellent shots , took pistols from their pockets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mihai : I am very sorry , but I have explained the situation to you and you must make a choice . <P> Antonescu : I will not resign and will not leave this country in the hands of people that I am not sure about . <P> The King reached with his foot for a pushbutton hidden under the carpet to summon the soldiers . Before he could reach it , however , they tramped in . <P> The soldiers silently forced Antonescu up the stairs to a small fireproof vault King Carol had built to safeguard his stamp collection . There they locked him in . <P> Antonescu 's bodyguards were invited to come inside for coffee . As they lifted their cups , servants slipped the pistols from their holsters , took them prisoner . <P> Meanwhile , the King 's fellow plotters set a trap for Antonescu 's leading collaborators , summoning the first by telephone and forcing him on arrival to call up another . Four or five arrived and made calls , among them the War Minister and the Prefect of Police . All were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rumania 's surrender to the Allies and the overthrow of Antonescu . . . . <P> Meanwhile , the King 's mother , Queen Helen , notified of events by telephone , sped from the royal family 's summer home at Sinaia ( northwest of Ploesti ) to a rendezvous with her son . All through German-held country she clutched a small pistol , determined to shoot the first enemy soldier attempting to halt her .
