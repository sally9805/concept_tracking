Not Ours <P> Sirs : <P> Somebody 's face is going to be red , brother ! <P> From LIFE , April 13 , page 33 , bottom cut : A group of marines are shown standing in a barbed-wire enclosure . The caption reads " Marines on Bataan line up for orders before wading into the jungle to clean out some Jap outposts . " <P> ( Now enter TIME magazine blushing . ) . . . Identically the same photograph appears TIME , April 13 but with another caption , which reads : " Marines have just cleaned out a Japanese hillside position ! " . . . <P> FRANK GRAHAM Columbia , S.C . <P> Sirs : <P> After more than 40 years service with the U.S. Marines I am a firm believer that no task is too great for that branch of our armed forces . . . . <P> In your issue of TIME , April 13 , and the issue of LIFE for the same date , identical pictures appear of a group of Marines said to have been taken somewhere on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they are about to wade into the jungle for the purpose of cleaning out some Jap outposts . TIME says they have just returned from what was presumably the same mission . <P> Is it possible that since I retired some three years ago the Marines have added another accomplishment to their bag of tricks ? Is it really so , that they are actually able to be coming &; going , both at one and the same time ? <P> Welcome , TIME &; LIFE , into the ranks of the true believers whose motto is " The Marines can do anything . " <P> F. L. BRADMAN <P> Brigadier General , U.S. Marines <P> Retired <P> San Francisco , Calif . <P> &gt; TIME 'S cover is red as usual but not its face . If the Japs had not already been cleaned off the neighboring hillsides , the Marines would not be standing around so nonchalantly. - ED . <P> Lost Generation ? <P> Sirs : <P> . . . Since the priorities system has greatly curtailed their activities and earnings , a large number of traveling salesmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait for the draft because of dependents and obligations . Most of these men have made lots of money in civilian life and $21 a month would drastically reduce their standard of life and they would not be able to return to it easily when the war is over . . . . Salesmen as a rule have a good education , are easily able to handle the public and their customers , are especially well versed in current affairs due to incessant reading of the newspapers . . . . Yet they are passed up by both services because of lack of specific knowledge . <P> As public relation officers or purchasing quartermasters , as post exchange officers , as intelligence officers , training camp instructors , as personnel officers and in the Navy as similar officers . . . as recruiting officers , as supply officers , and so very many other departments in which they are more qualified than many other ones who have been commissioned . Most salesmen know the service requirements and specifications for buying materials , know the best and fastest sources of supply , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group in America . I know personally that most of the post exchanges in the U.S. are not on a paying basis and could easily be if they had experienced merchandisers and buyers in charge .
