Georgia was getting more publicity than a two-headed calf-and seemed to suffer from the same ailments which harass such a rare beast . Each of Georgia 's heads wanted to go in a different direction . Each mooed incessantly . Each tried to butt the other out of the feedbox . Meanwhile , the animal proper did not seem able to eat , walk or cough up its cud , but simply stood disconsolately , enduring violent disturbances of the fourth stomach . <P> After two weeks in office , young Governor Herman ( " Hummon " ) Talmadge still held his favored position on the neck of state . But the constitutionality of his succession was far from settled . Lieut . Governor Melvin E. Thompson , who called himself governor and acted like one , kept crying that Hummon was a fraud . <P> Georgia reacted noisily . Hundreds of citizens gathered at impromptu meetings to attack Hummon . Two thousand students from eight Georgia colleges marched on the capitol , hanged Hummon in effigy , and bayed from the street outside . And the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white primary bill ; so many of his legislative backers left town one day that Thompson 's minority was almost able to vote a long recess . <P> " Coop de Tote . " Hummon was not abashed . He got the legislators together for a pep talk , gave them a piece of oratory distinguished mainly by his unique pronunciation of coup d ' tat . Hummon made it " coop de tate . " He went on the air to cry that radicals were plotting to " destroy the dominance of the white race in the South " - and to suggest that his followers mail in nickels and dimes to pay for the radio time he had used , a matter of $1,637.66 . To demonstrate his innate kindliness he even got himself photographed giving a dollar bill to a poverty-stricken Negro sharecropper . <P> Meanwhile each governor announced that he expected to get paid at the rate of $12,000 a year . Each appointed state officers . Hummon 's had the edge , since they were confirmed by the state senate . But the processes of government began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200 Georgia banks which handle state money did n't know which governor to recognize ; and one-the Fulton National Bank of Atlanta-prepared to institute legal action to find out who was really it . <P> It seemed doubtful that there would be any clear-cut legal decision for months , but at week 's end an Atlanta judge named Virlyn B. Moore expressed positive if indirect disapproval of the present state of affairs . A Negro bigamist arraigned in his court cried : " I caint see where it 's wrong for a man to have two wives when it 's all right for a state to have two governors . " Judge Moore just gave him twelve months in the cooler .
