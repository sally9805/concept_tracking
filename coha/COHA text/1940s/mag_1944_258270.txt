Farmer Franois Theron hates baboons . Some 1 , 000 of the big monkeys live on his sheep farm in South Africa 's Cape province . Says he : " They 'll rip off a sheep 's leg for breakfast and leave the animal to die . " <P> But medical service has come to the aid of Farmer Theron . The faculty at the University of the Witwatersrand has agreed to pay a pound apiece for all live baboons . <P> Says Professor C. J. Van der Horst : " The baboon is functionally so closely related to man that scientists in other parts of the world would regard it as a great forward step . . . if they could experiment on baboons instead of . . . cats , dogs , mice , guinea pigs and rabbits . " Science has already given the monkeys stomach ulcers , will soon use them for work on diseases of women and malnutrition . <P> Delighted South African farmers are now supplying this medical market with scores of baboons . Farmer Theron so far has shipped 203.  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
