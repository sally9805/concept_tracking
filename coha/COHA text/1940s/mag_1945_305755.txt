Outside , in Cairo 's dingy streets in the Citadel quarter , policemen with fixed bayonets ringed the court . Inside , British sappers had searched the courtroom from top to bottom for mines . On the crowded courtroom benches the red tarbooshes bobbed up &; down . The whispers of the perfumed mascaraed women rose to an excited buzz . Then the two handcuffed prisoners were ushered in-short , stocky , red-faced Eliahu Bet Tsouri , his arms defiantly akimbo ; tall , pale , black-mustached Eliahu Hakim , his slender fingers tightly twisted round the iron-spiked bars of the dock . <P> Not since seven Egyptian students had killed British General Sir Lee Stack in Cairo 20 years ago had Egypt been shaken by a crime like the murder of Lord Moyne , British Resident Minister in the Middle East . This time the killers were two young Palestinian Jews , political assassins of the Implacable Stern Gang ( TIME , Nov. 13 ) . The two men kept their eyes fixed on the five black-robed , green-sashed judges . <P> The proceedings were in English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any language but Hebrew . Because they distrusted the court interpreter , they later switched to English . Impatiently they admitted their acts . As Sternists and " sons of Palestine , " they had come to Cairo for the express purpose of killing Moyne , they said . Tsouri and Hakim had leaped on the running board of Lord Moyne 's car . Hakim had shot the Minister , Tsouri had stabbed his chauffeur to death . Then the prisoners began to expound the Stern credo of violence . They justified the assassination as an act of war against a foreign invader ( Britain ) . Austere Mahmoud Mansour Bey , the presiding judge , tried vainly to halt the torrent of burning words . At last he ordered reporters not to record them . The prisoners , he ruled , could not use an Egyptian court as their political forum . <P> The trial dragged on for a week . In quick succession the judges received letters from : 1 ) Arabs protesting the freedom of speech permitted to the prisoners ; 2 ) Jews protesting the censorship of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court if the men were condemned . <P> On the seventh day Hakim and Tsouri were sentenced to die by hanging . Egyptian courts can sentence , but can not directly order death . So the judges announced that the documents in the case would be sent to the Grand Mufti of Egypt , who has power to order death " in the Name of God . " Four days later he issued the order .
