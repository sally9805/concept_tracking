Last October Montana 's spare , slow-spoken Representative Michael J. Mansfield received a surprise summons to the White House . Said Franklin Roosevelt : " Mike , I want you to go to China for me . " <P> As a U.S. marine , Mike Mansfield had done a two-year tour in Peking and Tientsin 23 years ago . He had not been back , but as professor of Far Eastern history in Montana State University , and as a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , he had remained a staunch friend of China . Armed with a long , officially prepared list of pertinent questions , Mansfield set out on the Presidential mission . <P> This week , back in Washington , Mike Mansfield laid his findings before Congress in a 7,000-word report . Said he : " Conditions in China are really bad . . . . Chinese soldiers die of malnutrition . . . . China 's house has a leaky roof and a shaky foundation . Whether it can be put in order is a question mark . " <P> China 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt sure that China 's biggest problem was supply . He stayed long enough to change his mind . He rode the unfinished Ledo-Burma road , learned that supplies were being flown over the Hump at the monthly rate ( for November ) of 34,929 tons , and was told that trickle would be upped sharply with the road 's completion , expected soon . In Chungking and elsewhere he talked with U.S. generals , Chinese leaders . The more he saw and heard , the more Mike Mansfield was convinced that China 's gravest problem was the rift between the Kuomintang and China 's Communists , who govern 90,000,000 Chinese. * Said he : <P> " The biggest single problem today is the disunity within China itself ; The Kuomintang is disliked more every day , due to fear of the Army and the attitude of tax collectors ; this is proved by the revolts of the peasantry , criticism by provincial leaders , student revolts against conscription . . . . The Generalissimo looks askance at the Communists because he feels they are too strong and , if unchecked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Communists make their own laws , collect their own taxes , issue their own paper money . They are more agrarian reformers than revolutionaries but they are well disciplined . They have developed small cannons out of bored elms . For armament they use captured Japanese guns and when they have n't guns they use spears and clubs . The Soviets send in no aid to them . " <P> On the Other Hand . " Among their weak points is their spirit of sanctimoniousness ( they look on themselves as pious crusaders and do-gooders ) ; their knowledge of the outside world is primitive ; there are social distinctions among them and they are totalitarian in their own way . Their points of strength are that they have a good military force , estimated at around 600,000 , * and there is more democracy in their territory than in the rest of China . . . . <P> " Communist and Central Government troops that could be used to fight the Japanese are being used to blockade one another . It appears to me that both the Communists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties at the present time , and have been for the past two years , than they are in carrying on the war against Japan . Each party is more interested in its own status because both feel that America will guarantee victory . "
