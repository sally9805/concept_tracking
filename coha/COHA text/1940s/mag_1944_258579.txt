Kweilin , the " Paris of China , " was close to panic again . Panic had struck first seven weeks ago when the Japanese , poised in Hengyang , had seemed headed for the battered but glamorous Kwangsi city ( pop . 100,000 ) , whose holiday habits and friendly girls have made Kweilin 's name blessed among U.S. airforcemen on pass . <P> That time the Fourteenth Air Force 's big Kweilin base had been stripped and partly scorched . But the panic had died in a crackle of firecrackers when the Chinese Army and the Fourteenth 's airmen had checked the enemy at Hengyang . This time the threat to Kweilin was more serious than before . <P> The Japs had taken stubborn Hengyang , key point on the Hankow-Canton railroad . Now , instead of continuing directly south toward Canton , they flung 120,000 troops southwest along the spur line toward Kweilin . An underprivileged Chinese Army , ill-nourished , ill-armed , ill-clad , stood before them , the Fourteenth 's flyers hammered them desperately from above . <P> Reclaiming Lost Legions . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staging a diversion far to the north , around Ichang on the Yangtze River . But Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek knew that something more than a diversion was needed . Even as Hengyang was falling , he had put the finishing touches to a plan for Army reform which would doubtless meet opposition from vested military interests , a plan whose terms proclaimed that all was far from well in China 's war-worn Army . Its chief points : <P> 1 ) Separation of political and military powers ; war-zone commanders to be barred from functioning as provincial governors . <P> 2 ) All troops to be thoroughly trained . <P> 3 ) Feeding and medical care to be markedly improved . <P> 4 ) Number of units to be reduced , and remaining units to be brought to full-roster strength and physical fitness . <P> 5 ) Conscription of secondary-school students and graduates , hitherto draft-exempt , to form student brigades . <P> End of the Blockade . These long-overdue reforms , if implemented in time , could rejuvenate the wearied Chinese Army . So could U.S. artillerymen who , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds . But the Chinese would still need supplies from the west . To open a supply route , their tattered Chinese divisions fought harder last week up &; down the heartbreaking , jungle-clad ridges of the Salween River front , aiming to join with General Stilwell 's army pushing east from Myitkyina . <P> That juncture would give China a corridor to India . It would bring in trucks to replace the worn-out jalopies on which China now relies . It would bring a pipeline , with gasoline for Chennault 's planes . China 's troubles still would not be ended , but they would be very materially lessened .
