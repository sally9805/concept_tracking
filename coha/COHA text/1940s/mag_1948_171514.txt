From Finance Minister Douglas Abbott , Parliament got a preliminary tally on Canada 's foreign business in 1947 , found no comfort in the figures . The Dominion had spent $1,155,000,000 more in the U.S. than the U.S. had spent in Canada . Counting other deals ( e.g. , a $74 million subscription to the International Monetary Fund ) , the Dominion 's deficit in U.S. currency was $1,395,000,000 . Because only $652 million came in from Britain and other hard-up customers , Canada had dipped into reserves for $743 million .
