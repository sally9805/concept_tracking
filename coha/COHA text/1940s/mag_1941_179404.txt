Some 60,000 of Glasgow 's Clydeside ship yard workers went on strike last week despite the pleas of their union , the laws of their Government . It was only a 30-minute strike . But it was the first of a threatened series of " token " strikes brought on by the failure of the Engineering Union to speed up negotiations for higher wages . <P> Conferring in Leicester on wage increases for 2,500,000 workers , the Engineering Union begged for wartime solidarity , opposed all strike action , said union " reestablishment " could await the war 's end . <P> Labor Minister Ernest Bevin , who last year outlawed strikes and lockouts for the war 's duration , gave no hint of possible action . He had for some time been under fire for failure to deal more strongly with labor upsets . But when 60,000 vitally important producers earning $14.50-$19 a week ( better pay in Britain than it is in the U.S. ) felt strongly enough to strike against King and Union , the wisest answer was not necessarily " strong " dealing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
