From Sicily to the North Cape of Norway , the first days of spring brought clearing skies to Western Europe . Snow ( enough for good skiing ) lingered in northern Sweden , but in Stockholm people lounged at noon on steps and benches , tilting their faces to the new sun . One spring night last week at Josefsberg in the Russian Zone of Austria a Red Army soldier had a quarrel in a nightclub ; he came back later with a Tommy gun , sprayed the dance floor with bullets , killed the band leader and a customer , wounded more than a dozen . In Britain , country fields shone dazzling green in the clean light , and London shop girls carried home small bouquets of daffodils in the Underground . <P> In Paris , sidewalk cafs were lined with customers sipping aperitifs or spooning sweetened ices ; children sailed toy boats in the stone-rimmed pond of the Luxembourg Gardens . In Italy , peasant women remarked on the number of hens laying two eggs a day ; perhaps it was the warm weather . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and greyest winters in 20 years , the sun was shining again , fitfully , but shining . <P> Spring brought work as well as play and immemorial festival . It also brought , as always after the cold days and long dark nights , a mood of revived hope . Europe needed it . For the mood of Western Europe was a mixture of anxieties as much as hopes , of discouragements as much as resolution . A great deal of the European mood was apparent in what people did and chatted about ; something more became clear in the answers they gave in simultaneous surveys* of what they thought and expected . <P> In what they did and thought the people of Western Europe displayed a similarity of hopes &; fears , of cherished habits and guarded optimism about the future . Differences existed , and some were striking . But , looking back on ' 48 , historians might find the differences less important than the likenesses . Outside the Iron Curtain , Europe , for better or worse , was one . <P> " Compared with last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now better off , worse off , or about the same ? " <P> Europeans find little to cheer about . Thirty-four months after V-E day , recovery has come so slowly-so much hope has been deferred-that few can bring themselves to say they feel better off ( though engaged couples , newlyweds , and young lawyers busy with their first cases nearly always do say so ) . In Sweden , in Switzerland and in Italy most say that their condition is " the same . " In Britain , France and the U.S. Zone of Germany , most say " worse " : <P> Better Worse Same Undecided <P> Britain 17% 46% 36% 1% <P> France 9 59 31 1 <P> Sweden 27 18 53 2 <P> Switzerland 26 24 45 5 <P> Italy 33 30 36 1 <P> U.S. Zone 10 54 36 - <P>
