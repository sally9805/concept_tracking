Into Manhattan 's big , plushy Yale Club last week went the New York Daily News 's Inquiring Fotographer Jimmy Jemail ( TIME , July 21 , 1941 ) to ask a strange question : what would you think of a swap of Churchill for Roosevelt ? <P> Four said they thought it would be an excellent thing . Only one said it would not do . Said a sixth : " It would be better than a swap of Roosevelt for Stalin . " None got around to asking how it could be done . Neither had Jimmy 's boss , Yaleman Joseph Medill Patterson , editor of the Daily News , who mortally hates and fears the President .
