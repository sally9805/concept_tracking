Least arty of all arts is the Hollywood cinema . But many a famed movie star , toiling under the burden of Hollywood 's glamor and high salaries , has cursed a secret craving for the higher things . How great this craving has grown was made evident last fortnight when Los Angeles Art Dealer Robert Gump put on an exhibition of paintings , sculpture , photographs and ceramics by celebrities of Southern California 's social and cinema world- " important contributions to the Fine Arts by 30 outstanding personalities whose significance in their avocations is little known . " Most presentable piece was a craftsmanlike etching , San Pedro , by Cinemactor Lionel Barrymore . Other items : <P> &gt;Scorpio , purple-shaded portrait of Cinemactress Hedy Lamarr ( Ecstasy , Algiers ) , complete with a horsewhip , a rose and tinted toenails , by Comedian Reginald Gardiner , painted in the days when Artist Gardiner was her most devoted escort . <P> &gt;A drawing of Cinemactress Maria Ouspenskaya by Ginger Rogers . <P> &gt;The stream-of-consciousness street scene by Gracie Allen entitled Dogs-Gather-on - Street - Corner - to- Watch - Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Levy Gallery ( TIME , Oct. 3 , 1938 ) . <P> &gt;Sculpture by Anna Sten ( Nana ) and Vincent Price ( Victoria Regina ) . <P> Opening-day visitors found all this art pretty impressive . Critics were less polite . Growled the Los Angeles Times 's Arthur Millier : " Famous actors and actresses can be very bad artists . "
