" Tell me the sort of agreement that the United Nations will reach with respect to the world 's petroleum resources when the war is over , and I will undertake to analyze the durability of the peace that is to come . " - Harold L. Ickes . <P> Honeymoon 's End . This statement by the U.S. Oil Boss was still freshly inked in the current issue of the American Magazine when the whole problem of what the U.S. should do about oil came sharply into the foreground . The gist of a special report on the all-important subject , made by Ickes ' Foreign Operations Committee of 13 U.S. oil executives and two British representatives , leaked out , via the New York Times . Then Honest Harold released the full text , which he had not yet read . With a bang , the honeymoon between Ickes and the oilmen was over . <P> On three important preliminary points , the Oil Czar and the oilmen agreed , 1 ) The U.S. is drawing on its own reserves so heavily that it is on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) As Ickes put it in the American : " The capital of the oil empire is on the move to the Middle East . " 3 ) The U.S. had better get into that empire in a big way , and fast . To do so the U.S. must find its postwar oil policy right now . <P> Stumbling Block . The policy is the stumbling block . Ickes ' mind is not yet made up , but his words &; deeds clearly indicate that he wants the U.S. Government to get a big piece of the world oil reserves . Last month California Arabian Standard Oil Co. ( half owned by Texas Co. and half by Standard of California ) attempted to get Government funds for a $120,000,000 expansion in the Middle East . This blew up because Ickes-plus the U.S. Army &; Navy-wanted a direct Government stock interest . <P> The oil industry agrees with California Arabian : there should be no Government managerial interest in world oil . In a sense the industry wants to have and eat its cake . The report last week called for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests negotiate . <P> Mr. Ickes ' Foreign Operations Committee avers that private enterprise is the better means to insure U.S. participation in world oil because " private enterprise can operate with a minimum of political complications . " Mr. Ickes maintains just as stoutly that no foreign nation would dare to toy with a U.S. Government interest , as it might ( and has in Mexico ) with privately owned corporations . <P> Both sides also have case histories to cite . In Saudi Arabia , U.S. companies got hold of major interests between 1933 and 1939 , despite much higher bids on the part of other world powers . They were successful precisely because their interests were obviously nonpolitical . But the Ickes side argues that most nations of importance have long had a **29;10167;TOOLONG combine in the world oil fields ( Great Britain , The Netherlands ) .
