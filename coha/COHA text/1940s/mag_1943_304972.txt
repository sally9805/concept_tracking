The fall of Orel and Belgorod last week prompted the Russians to raise again the question of a second front in western Europe . Thirty divisions of Germans diverted from the Russian front , they thought , could so weaken the Wehrmacht 's line that the Red Army could clean the Germans up in 1943 . So once more they needled their Allies : <P> &gt; Said the Russian communiqu on the victories at Orel and Belgorod : " More favorable conditions are created for the development of active offensive operations by our allies on the Continent . " <P> &gt; Said Pravda , official organ of the Communist Party : at Casablanca President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill agreed on " an exhaustive plan of action to be applied in the next nine months . " The nine months , Pravda reminded , are nearly up . The Allies have a choice : " The opening of a second front in 1943 means the war will be ended quickly or become a war of attrition.
