SAVORA 'S A STORY BY SYLVIA THOMPSON W HEN you wanted to dine exquisitely in a muffled and luxurious quiet you went to Savora 's . There is no gourmet , no expensive woman who does not know that olive-green door a few steps off Piccadilly . At Savora 's there was the first asparagus , the earliest mimosa , oysters just out of bed , the cornice pear in its second of perfection . If Savora gave you a rose from the vase on your table it lasted three weeks . An indiscreet couple , lunching in that hushed atmosphere ( always very faintly fragrant of pineapple and gardenias ) , were spun into a kind of cocoon of discretion whose invisible substance emanated , I think , from Savora himself ; so that the most flagrant love affair in the shaded light of those silver sconces became a delicious diplomacy . Savora himself had the face of a domesticated bandit . He was a little man in the sense that Bonaparte was a little man . That is to say he had a bow stomach and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never was a good restaurateur who could not traverse miles of carpet in a day . ) But here the Corsican resemblance stops except for the complexion . For Savora 's black eyes were not brooding ; they were bright , clever , and quick-moving and greedy ; and , when one got to know him , they could be gay or excited or deeply sentimental . And his sense of his own greatness was ebulliently extrovert . Savora first observed me when I dined there with what I was later to hear him categorize as " a courtesy-title Lorrd . " Next time I was with Elgar Shane , who has painted every woman that Savora has fed . Savora came springing over to talk to Elgar . At first I had the impression they were exchanging inside information about duchesses , movie actors , business magnates ; then I realized that Savora was only receiving information and giving little thoughtful nods with those exclamations that Latins make , some inhaled and some exhaled . " She 's gone to Antibes now ? " said Elgar ; and that glossy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shone as he nodded , his brown chunky left hand resting on his hip , his right thumb tucked behind the right lapel of his coat just below the red carnation . The next time I went he came over to my table , giving my name distinction as he spoke it , and hazarded a passing " miladi " to my companion . ( He was to check her up later ; " that lady in naveeblue who was with you in Aprile last year , who was she ? " ) He recommended a wine to us and told me he had seen a photograph " in the noospaper " of my children . He added that they were " beautiful children ! " Next time he asked me at once if the children were well , with a warmth of interest which I tried vainly to believe was just professional . I asked him if he was fond of children . He told me that he had some of his own and came back from a vivacious greeting of a Personage , to inform me that his eldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and that his youngest was a little girl of four ? " Graziella , " he said , the radiance of a young mother on his smooth bandit 's face . He moved away again with a skating walk . But our waiter placated my interest by the timidly offered information that the children of the patron were " verree nice indeed . " I had noticed this waiter before because of his likeness to a little monkey . His eyes seemed dark with the unshed tears of exile , and he was as clearly stamped with a sad little destiny as Savora 's resilient astute personality was marked for satisfactions and rewards . In fact , this little grizzle-headed man would have seemed usual in a cheap restaurant in Soho ; and was so unlike Savora 's other waiters , all sleek , young , acrobatic , that I wondered at his being there . Savora returned later during my luncheon , to respond to a murmured inquiry from my companion by whisking out a piece of card and scribbling " His Excellency the German Ambassador " ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a little jerk-up of his head , suave in its discretion , yet in its restrained vigor implying that he let the quality of his clientele demonstrate that there was nowhere better than Savora 's . The short cut to my friendship for Savora was of course the subject of children . Not that he ever thought of it as " friendship . " Perhaps friendliness is the better description ; he called it " my kind interest " and , I think , explained it by my being a writer . He said to me on the day when he invited me to visit his family , " Naturrally a writer must see all sorts of peoples " ? his manner a mixture of deference and cordiality . He told me he had discussed the invitation with his wife , and what an honor she would find it ! And at last  --  here pride expanded his face until the shrewder lines vanished  --  at last he would be able to show me the children . I asked him if his wife was pretty . " My wife ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing-off child . He twisted a corner of his lips . " She is n't too bad , I must say it if I should n't , Signorina . " He always used " Signorina " to me , assuming that I liked to be addressed by my pen name . If I telephoned for a table and he himself came to the telephone , it was always , " A table for the Signorina . . . . " It was arranged that he should drive me to his home at Putney for tea . He added , to the obvious reason of this being his free time , the remark that his wife liked best to have a tea-party . Next day as he drove me to Putney I thought that in his black Homburg and black jacket and pin-striped trousers and gray spats he looked surprisingly like any Italian commercial traveler . I had been lunching at the restaurant and watched him , when the last client had left , retire through the swing door still in his grandiose manner and re-emerge , oddly vulgarized , tan gloves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As we were getting into his car , a Fiat , for whose shabbiness he made excuses , my little monkey waiter appeared and got into the back . I think it was on that drive that Savora talked about his childhood in Florence . His father had a retail glove shop ; " We lived over a little square , off the Via ? " ( I forget which street . ) We entered a semi-circular drive before a gray-granite villa of unusual height , its front door painted glossy olive-green . A wire basket of pink geraniums hung below the portico and every window was bridally festooned with thick white lace . Savora sprang on to the flight of white steps , black Homburg in hand , making little bows while he repeated boastfully that here was his humble home . The little waiter had climbed out after us and I saw him efface himself into a side entrance of the house . I will not catalogue the contents of Savora 's home . The majolica umbrella stand , the false Watteaus , purple-velvet portieres , exquisite Aubusson carpets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were only a background for the family Savora  --  that smiling rigidly posed album group , entirely dressed in white . Mrs. Savora rose from a sofa to welcome me . She was in a white serge costume , her blouse had a white satin jabot , her shoes were white . She looked like an opera singer dressed for yachting ; it seemed as if at any moment her smile might change to the richest contralto singing . Savora presented , rather than introduced , them all ; his satisfaction spotlighting in turn Graziella , a Correggio angel vulgarized by a big white-silk hair bow ; Carmen , aged eight , with a curranty stare and brilliantined ringlets ; Angelo and Benedetto in white sailor blouses , one curly , one glossy-haired , and both with brown velvet eyes ; Vittoria , a beauty aged twelve in an Irish-lace blouse and a white pleated skirt ; Andreana , a thin fifteen-year-old in similar clothes with a fuzzy head and spectacles ; and Alberto , aged eighteen . Alberto 's black trousers and Andreana 's black patent shoes were the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her glowing skin , and looked contented and pleasure-loving After the first moments of introduction the stiffness was gone  --  as if the photograph had been taken . And with " Thetis , look after the Signorina , " Savora vanished muttering the phrase " Washandbrushup . " Mrs. Savora urged me to sit down and handed me a plate with a folded lace napkin and a gilt teaknife and fork , and told me that she was " ever so pleased " to see me . She spoke a suburban English enriched by her Mediterranean accent . While I ate my first sandwich she told me , with smiling contented glances , about the injustice of Alberto 's examination papers , Andreana 's constipation , the bargain she had made yesterday for an ermine scarf , about her mother 's recent death in Athens , and the details of her last confinement , when Graziella was born . Everything she said was filtered through her smile . The tea was of the kind caterers produce for weddings , plates of fragile sandwiches , cream-filled cakes , Eclairs , pastry flans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tucked in below their chins , their plates on their knees , holding their gilt knives and forks . One of them , I think it was Angelo , fetched a tray and Mrs. Savora put on it a kitchen cup of tea , and cakes and sandwiches . As the little boy went out of the room , she explained that it was for the " povero Enrichino , " and I learned that my little waiter inhabited an attic room . She told me , with an affectionate placidity , of his troubles : how his wife had died last year , and it was Mr. Savora 's idea that Enrichino should live with them . She said , " Mr. Savora is very charitable . " I wondered if they had deducted his rent from his wages , and tried to imagine him , upstairs , eating those gala cakes before returning to Mayfair to serve an incomparable dinner to the French diplomat , who , Savora had hinted during our drive , had ordered a table for to-night . Before the child returned Savora himself came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hyacinth-blue shirt unzipped at the neck to expose a plump brown bosom garnished with tendrils of black hair . Round his waist was a belt of emerald and violet stripes . He sat down , clapping his hands genially , his knees apart , his stomach comfortably bowed out , smiling with that flashing automatic sweetness of the Italian in a good humor . He asked , " The Signorina is enjoying her tea ? " While his expression demanded with superb complacency , " What does the Signorina think of my family ? " ( His inquiry as to my pleasure in my tea had inevitably the cadence of " Miladi likes ? Your Excellency is enjoying ? " ) Mrs. Savora sent another child to ask " Meesesclarrk " for more hot water , and turned to me to complain archly , her red lips drawn back over her teeth , that Mr. Savora would not allow her " to have a parrlorrmaid . " Then she gave him a rolling , flirting glance from under her eyelids , and he , stretching out his capable hairy arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw her back a humorous lustful glance , and remarked , " Parrlorrmaids are damnonsense . " This was evidently his habitual ruling in the matter and caused a perfunctory " Notty Boy ! " while the children turned their toffy-brown munching faces to one another , and their white teeth shone . Mrs. Clarke herself came in with the hot water ; a bony woman in a stained high-necked apron , bringing an aroma of mutton that contrasted with the perfume of Quelques Fleurs emanating from Savora since his washandbrushup . When she had gone again Mrs. Savora said , " He wo n't pay " ( she pronounced it " pie " ) " for a uniform . You know " ; she patted my hand confidentially , " you know , Signorina , a nice afterrnoon black and cap an ' aprron , eh ? But he do n't mind to spend twenty-five pounds on a sofa , eh ? " She patted the sofa on which we sat ; " it was covered in deep-rose brocade . " Upholstery must be first-class , " pronounced Savora . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He drew the child into the crook of his arm , " Eh , Graziella ? " As he gazed on her swarthy cherub face his shrewd eyelids had the tenderness of a Madonna . Then he began a lazy amorous bickering with his wife , the question of upholstering giving rise to other instances of spending and saving . I remember that she asserted that it was she who had first had the idea of Savora 's ; the early Savora 's in Dean Street , Soho ? " a cheap place , but with a cachet , ? you know , Signorina ! " From wartime , looking-back , the years of peace seem to lose perspective , telescope up , and then widen out into a glowing commemorative fresco . When I recall that tea-party in Putney I sec the hyacinth-blue shirt , Graziella 's cherubprofile , the opulent whiteness of Mrs. Savora on her rose-pink sofa . I was n't in London during the first eight months of the war ; during that winter of dull , queer suspense , and that spring of serene loveliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . I had expected a change of atmosphere there ; that some way the war must have infiltrated and tarnished . There was a change . I saw and felt it the minute I got in ; the minute that deep carpet was under my feet , and the warm fragrance of gardenias and pineapple in my senses . But the change was in kind not in degree . The peace smartness had become a war smartness . Mascaraed eyes were shadowed by peaks , masculine shoulders were exquisite in khaki , well-known gourmets ' stomachs were zoned by Sam Brownes , air-force uniforms were steel-dark under the glow of the silver sconces ; Admiral X was dining in a corner with his son , a boy in battle-dress ; Savora 's most faithful duchess was there with one of the few men in mufti , a rosy star of the Ministry of Information . I noticed a couple of French officers in stained uniforms ( Dunkirk was twenty-four hours ago ) . Savora led us to our table . ( I was with a journalist back from Paris that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He mentioned the obvious difficulties of wartime catering . But he was in high spirits . I do n't mean gay spirits ; high-grave spirits . He spoke of the " miracle of Dunkirk " with reverence , and tears in his eyes , and I remembered that he was a Catholic . He said , his look brooding and defiant , his chin thrust forward in his Bonaparte manner , " But we shall win , Signorina ! We shall win " ; and I saw that he had forgotten his own nationality . I watched him go from one table to another , his vivacious murmur to a girl and boy , a couple ( I recognized them , just married and both in khaki ) ; I saw his quick passage of humor with two staff officers , and his response to the grunt of cordiality from Admiral X in the corner . And as I watched I realized a new aspect of Savora 's , and of Savora himself . I realized that what he was giving and getting was not just an exchange of obsequiousness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for which I ca n't find a better word than affection . It was mixed up of course with all those specious motives that make restaurateurs over-courteous and their patrons lavish . But the affection was there . He was giving and getting it , and with it , the sort of lift of loyalty that gets into ordinary peacetime associations in wartime . To his clientele that night Savora 's was part of London ; their London that they were quite ready , after dinner to-night if necessary , to die for . And Savora himself , whom they had known in all the good easy years , was here with them now , in this bad time , so that they felt to-night , sipping his cognac , that his black-padded shoulder , red carnation in the lapel , was lined up next to theirs . As I was going Savora came up to me at the door . I asked him about his children . He told me he had wanted to take a house for them in a safety area , but Thetis had refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He added , " They do n't like to leave me , " beaming a momentary conceit and tenderness . Enrichino hurried to whisper something ; a lady was displeased . I recognized her , a full-bosomed caryatid of the A.T.S. " Excuse me , Signorina . " As I went out Savora was bending over her , his fingertips pressed together in concern , his features shadowed in attention . Two days after Italy came into the war , I read Savora 's name in the list of well-known restaurateurs interned . I felt a jolt of dismay and sympathy . There was nothing I could do . But I kept being haunted by the thought of Savora , wrenched away from his family and their beloved bedizened Putney'home . I seemed to see all their smiles switched off , like footlights . And I wondered also about Enrichino . The torpedoing of the Arandora Star was announced on the nine o'clock radio news . No names of course ; just the summary , and in its few hideous indications the brutality of that stampede of Germans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims several well-known Italian restaurant proprietors . " Savora 's name was in the List of victims published ten days later . I wrote to Mrs. Savora . After a delay I had a note from her , thick black borders round envelope and paper . She thanked me for my " very kind sympathy " ; she would be so pleased if would visit her any time . The fa  --  ade of the gray Putney villa had the sardonic unchangedness of the inanimate things in tragedy . The windows displayed a bridal freshness ; the geranium basket hung below the portico . I pressed a bell button in its polished brass plate , and the door was opened by  --  I realized it was " Meesesclarrk " transfigured in a black dress and white cap and apron . She said " Madam 's in the drawin ' - room . " I am inaccurate in saying the windows were unchanged . As I entered the drawing-room I realized that all the blinds  --  ivory yellow blinds with wide bands of filet lace across the bottom , were half-down , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer afternoon . And in this amber light was Mrs. Savora in black , as completely in black as she had formerly been remarkably in white . Black-serge dress , high to the throat , black widow 's veil cascading from a hat of black straw , black stockings , black patent shoes and black kid gloves  --  a solid monument of Latin , or Levantine , widowhood , that would have struck me as caricature if her grief had n't been so striking also , her eyelids so swollen and stained , her mouth so piteous . " Ah . . Signorina ! . . . Signorina ! . . " We sat together on the rose brocade sofa , and her black kid-bound fingers kept gripping mine while she told me , the thickened contralto notes tumbling into the museum stillness of the room , how she had heard the news . " It was the 9 o'clock news . . . I sit here , with the children . . . only not Alberto , Alberto is in Italy . Did you know , Signorina , Savora sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He must be in the army . " . . . When she had pushed the handkerchief back into the black crocodile bag on her knee she told me how , suddenly , she had realized the words " torpedoed " ? Germans and Italians . At once she knew ! But the children only understood when they heard her scream out . She said , " I knew that there was no hope . . I see him drowning ! " She repeated these phrases and others , her tears flowing , her underlip shaking . " When the children underrstood they begin also to scream . Graziella , she is like me , she had hysterics , no one could quiet her , she scream and scream and I was the same , and Andreana , she telephone for the doctor . " At this point she broke off to get up and go to the door and out into the hall and shout up to the children to come downstairs , and I could hear her raucous honeyed scolding , " Did n't I tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They came : the negative of their former photograph ; in black , even to the pleating of Andreana 's and Vittoria 's skirts . The little boys ' black sailor blouses had white stripes on the collars ; Graziella 's hair bow was black . They came each in turn across the parquet to shake hands and offer me their muted smiles . Their mother had returned to her place beside me . When they had gone out she once more let her grief have its way with her , expressing it with more . tears and more narration , telling me , without chronology , the whole story of Savora 's internment : " the police coming that night , it was the Wednesday nightand they come right in here into the drawing-room , imagine it ! Savora he keep saying he will come back soon and warr will be over soon . He kiss us all so many times . He is so upset . But upset ! You should have seen him , Signorina ! And the children ! " I saw them . . . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helena . I asked her if they had taken Enrichino at the same time . " Si , si . " I envisaged his sad , lined little face as he followed his patron down the white steps , his last look over his shoulder at the patron 's wife and beautiful children . Mrs. Savora opened her bag and took out a folded sheet of thin paper . " The letter of Enrichino , " she said . She handed it to me , and I asked if he had been on the Arandora Star also . She nodded , staring in front of her . " Yes , yes , read , Signorina . " The writing was spidery , the description brief from evident lack of the power or habit of description . It was in English . It began " I am so sorry . " There are two passages that I remember . " A German gentleman pushed over Mr. Savora when he was entering a boat . I call out to him but there was very big noise . I am in a boat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face in the waves . He is crying terrible . " I gave her back the letter . Perhaps she had read it so many times that the horror concentrated in its inexpert words had been assimilated in her general grief . Or , in spite of her personal loss , she may have been able to feel , as from an arena , the drama of that scene that , to me , was only sickening horror . Horror unredeemed by courage . Enrichino , cowering in a boat , staring in agony at the awful seething waters , the unresting wreckage , the wrenching , fighting figures in the water , and those other figures , rising and falling with the rise and fall of the wreckage ; and that distorted face in the waves , " crying terrible . " I thought of that proverbial last moment when a drowning man sees his whole life . Was there for Savora , be-tween those last beats of doomed terror , a timeless second when he saw . . . the " little square " in the Florentine sunshine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a London boarding house , and his own twenty-year-old face smooth in the stained bit of mirror on the window-sill : and London itself a challenge of lamp-mooned fogs and elegant summers spread out like crimson carpets before the feet of Society . . . . Crimson carpets . Society . . . . The earnest deft apprenticeship to and fro through baize service doors , tail-coat at noon , the flicked napkin , the names , the faces ; the manners of then famous maltres d'hOtel observed and practiced . . . The girl , a Greek , is pretty , plump ; sensible too . She knows how to do accounts .. . . Two rooms . She laughs but knows how to cook . And " round the corner in Dean Street , " she says , " there are premises to let . " . . . Dean Street , Savora 's . . . Savora 's , Mayfair . . . . " Bon jour , Comtesse ! " . . . " Good-morning , Lord ? " . . " Good-morning , Miss ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pear in its moment of perfection . . . . The blackout has made no difference . " Good-morning , General ! " " Bon soir , Monsieur le Capitain . " . . " We shall win , Signorina ! " . . . We shall win  --  in Mayfair , in Putney too . . . . Thetis she like Putney best . . . . Graziella 's cherub face , dark eyes , in our splendid drawing-room on the sun-gold parquet . . . . Or is it Graziella ? or is it . . . just one of the other children in the sunshine on the little square ? I asked Mrs. Savora , perfunctorily , if Enrichino was back in England . " In a camp , yes . . . it poverino ! " Shc added , " But we keep his room here just as he leave it and , do you know , Signorina , only yesterday " ? her voice thickened again ? " Graziella she put a red carnation just as he liked to wear it for a buttonhole in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass shelf above the basin . " Her thought had slid from Enrichino 's attic to Savora 's dressing room . " But after the warr he will come back ! " My look must have shown uncertainty of her meaning ; and as she realized this , her response was so trenchantly common sense as to sound like humor ( which it was n't ) . " I am referring to Enrichino , Signo-rina . " It was in this connection that she mentioned her idea that after the war Enrichino might start a little restaurant , in Putney  --  it might be possible for her to find perhaps a little capital ? " Quite a little restaurant , you know , Signorina , cheap , but with a cachet ! "
