Nazi tanks , crunching west through the mud and sleet of Luxembourg and Belgium last week , gave the U.S. two separate setbacks : one on the Western front , one on the home front . The size of the military defeat would be measured some day in American soldiers killed , wounded , captured . The shape of the home front defeat was already obvious . U.S. civilians would begin a not-so-happy New Year by paying penance for incorrigible optimism . <P> Suddenly , with the news of the German breakthrough , many U.S. preoccupations-even Christmas-seemed like luxuries . It was no time to scramble into a peacetime job , or to talk about manufacturing refrigerators . <P> Last week 's communiqus were a resounding vindication of those who had been denouncing overoptimism for three long years .

" He also threw a blunt question at Selective Service : what about all those 4-F professional athletes between the ages of 18 and 26 ? " They proved to thousands by their great physical feats upon the football or baseball field that they are as physically fit ... as are the 11,000,000 men in uniform . " <P> OPA planned to ration most of the foods which had become point-free earlier this year : meat ( including utility-grade beef ) , canned vegetables , fats . <P> OPA warned that a revised shoe-rationing system is coming up , since there is not enough leather to let everyone have two new pairs of shoes in 1945 . <P> WPB slashed the production of passenger car tires for the first quarter of 1945 by 1,650,000 ; junked all tire-rationing certificates issued before March , 1944 ; informed A-card drivers that they could : 1 ) try to find recaps next year or 2 ) get off the roads . <P> WPB , invoking some of its sweeping priority powers for the first time in the war , ruled that hereafter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to get 300,000 more workers into war plants , WPB may snatch away the offending company 's fuel , materials , transportation . <P> Selective Service upped the draft quota for January and February from 60,000 to 80,000 . <P> WPB froze until further notice , at present levels , all civilian goods production . <P> In an Order of the Day to his troops last week , General Eisenhower had found cause for hope that the enemy 's big gamble might be turned into Germany 's " worst defeat .

( " Cap " ) Krug : the U.S. must assume that we will still be fighting Germany in 1946.
