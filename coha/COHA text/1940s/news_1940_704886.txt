txt Eight years after her husband shattered the tradition of the non-appearance of Presidential candidates before the conventions which nominated them , Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt . in the same hall and on the same platform , established another tonight , the first wife of a President or nominee ever to address a major political party conclave . Her talk was brief , her word was not the last word by many thousands in the convention record . But the message she brought and the tribute she got , of sustained silence for an impressively delivered appeal for a united country , loomed as another peak in a turbulent evening . She was introduced at 10:30 o'clock while the State delegations were at fever heat over contests for the Vice Presidential nomination and before the President had addressed the assembly , because she was due to return East in a specially chartered plane tonight . She arrived just before sunset , in . a plane which left New York at 2:45 o'clock , with her son , Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. , as her only companion on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the . President to the convention in this city where he was nominated for the Presidency in 1932 . She brought the news to the delegates that the President , who sent word earlier that he " had no wish to be a candidate , " did not plan a campaign , due to the heavy burden involved in the conduct of the nation 's affairs during the world crisis . In her address she disclosed this important fact after a special tribute to Postmaster General James A. Farley , who met her plane at the Municipal Airport . Gravity Marks Interview An unusual gravity was reflected in Mrs. Roosevelt 's demeanor both during a mass interview to which she submitted immediately after her arrival in Chicago and as she stood on the platform facing the packed throng in the Stadium waiting for Chairman Barkley to complete his introduction of her . When she stepped off the plane at the American Air Lines hangar she told a press corps that she could not say whether she would speak at the evening session , " because I have just arrived and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She received reporters in an upstairs office of the air lines company , isolated from the union passenger station . The first question was : " Are you happy about the nomination ? " " Happy ! " she exclaimed , without a trace of a smile . " I do n't know how any one could be particularly happy about the nomination in the present state of the world . It is a tremendous responsibility to be nominated for the Presidency . " Requested to Make Trip " How did you happen to come ? " she was asked . " I came because a number of my friends asked me to come , " she replied . " Would you say who those friends were ? " " I 'd rather leave that to them to " Was Mr. Farley one of those friends ? " " I 'll leave that to him to answer , " she said , smiling at the Postmaster General , who stood near her ' shoulder . " But we asked him , " some one piped up , " and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Farley actually was one of the group remained a mystery as far as Mrs. Roosevelt was concerned . She was next asked to say when she made the decision to come and she replied that it was made definitely late last night or at an early hour this morning . " Was the President willing for you to come ? Did he wish you well ? " another reporter inquired . " I do n't remember that he wished me well , " she retorted , smiling again . " I suppose , of course , that he was willing for me to come  --  or I would not have come . " This statement was clarified later with the additional information that she did not volunteer to make the trip . " Were you surprised when the President disclosed that he did not wish to run again ? " the questions resumed . " Not at all , " she answered . " As I said before , I can not imagine in the present state of the world , why any one would want to carry such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the burden you carry for other people for the sake of the nation , but also because of the burden you carry in preserving that nation 's place among the peoples of the world . " " How do you feel about another four years in the " White House ? " " No one knows as yet whether there will be another four years , " she responded , laughing for the first time ; " so I can not say how I feel about it . " " Will you go with the President on his campaign trips ? " " His campaign trips ! " She repeated as though astonished . " Why , I do not for a moment think the President will make a campaign trip . Certainly a campaign trip would not be possible in view of the burden of duties which precluded even a visit to this convention . " " Did you know that your name was placed in nomination this afternoon for the Vice Presidency ? " another reporter put in . She laughed briefly , but heartily . " I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in dismissing the subject . Greeted by Farley on Arrival Mr. Farley was waiting with a large sedan , a motorcycle escort and a Chicago police guard of about fifty men as the big silver flagship Brooklyn of the American Air Lines swooped low over the airport , silhouetted momentarily against the setting sun . As it landed and taxied slowly up , the gangplank was rolled against the fuselage , and Mr. Farley was the first one up it to greet Mrs. Roosevelt , who stepped from the plane followed by Franklin Roosevelt Jr . The First Lady paused to smile and wave at the radio , police and press groups assembled to greet her , posed for photographers , and spoke briefly into the microphones held up to her across the rail . Her traveling suit was a tailored ensemble of navy cloth coat with long lapels of Eleanor blue , with a soft crepe dress beneath in the same shade . Her hat was a small one of navy straw in a modified beret type with Eleanor blue flowers topping the low crown . She carried a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stevens Hotel where she was taken for a short interval , she added a shoulder spray of white orchids to her costume . Asked whether she knew the contents of the President 's schedule for radio presentation later in the evening , Mrs. Roosevelt stated that it had not been completed when she left Hyde Park , and that while she knew " in a general way " what was in the President 's mind , she could not predict what the theme might be . " I know from actual experience that you never can tell what is going to be in a speech until it is delivered , " she added with a smile . She planned , she revealed , to leave Chicago on the same chartered plane on which she arrived , to make the trip back to New York and Hyde Park , later tonight . Text of Her Addresa Mrs. Roosevelt 's speech was as follows : " Delegates to the convention , visitors , friends : It is a great pleasure for me to be here and to have an opportunity to say a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I want to say a word to our National Chairman , James A. Farley . For many years I have worked under Jim Farley and with Jim Farley , and I think nobody could appreciate more what he has done for the party , what he has given in work and loyalty . And I want to give him here my thanks and devotion . " And now , I think that I should say to you that I am conscious , but I can not possibly bring you a message from the President because he will give you his own message . But , as I am here , I want you to know that no one could not be conscious of the confidence which you have expressed in him . " I know and you know that any man who is in an office of great responsibility today faces a heavier responsibility , perhaps , than any man has ever faced before in this country . Therefore , to be a candidate of either great political party is a very serious and a very solemn thing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary nomination in an ordinary time . We people in the United States have got to realize today that we face now a grave and serious situation . Campaign Is Called Impossible " Therefore , this year the candidate who is the President of the United States can not make a campaign in the usual sense of the word . He must be on his job . " So each and every one of you who give him this responsibility , in giving it to him assume for yourselves a very grave responsibility because you will make the campaign . You will have to rise above considerations which are narrow and partisan . " You must know that this is the time when all good men and women give every bit of service and strength to their country that they have to give . This is the time when it is the United States that we fight for , the domestic policies that we have established as a party that we must believe in , that we must carry forward , and in the world we have a position of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day what may come . This is no ordinary time . No time for weighing anything except what we can best do for the country as a whole , and that rests that responsibility on each and every one of us as individuals . " No man who is a candidate or who is President can carry this situation alone . This is only carried by a united people who love their country and who will live for it to the fullest of their ability , with the highest ideals , with a determination that their party shall be absolutely devoted to the good of the nation as a whole and to doing what this country can to bring the world to a safer and happier condition . "
