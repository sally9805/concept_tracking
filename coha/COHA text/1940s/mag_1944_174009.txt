Over Finland the long darkness of the subarctic winter nights had begun to close in . So had the political night . In Helsinki , an assassin fired five bullets at close range into the back of a Russian naval officer 's head . The assassin escaped . Near Helsinki 's airport a Finn , armed with a flatiron , attacked a Russian soldier . The Finn was arrested . At the same airport , a few days later , were found the murdered bodies of two Red Army officers . The shattered country was heaving and grinding like an ice floe . <P> The shaky Finnish Government of Premier Urko Castren , in crisis ever since the signing of the armistice with Russia last September , staggered out of office . In its place moved a new cabinet headed by Dr. Juho Kusti Paasikivi , 74 . Dr. Paasikivi was persona grata in Moscow . He had helped negotiate three treaties that ended Finland 's three wars with Russia-in 1920 , 1940 and 1944 . The national crisis was deferred , not ended . <P> Red Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hotel Torni , the plushy Societetshuset and the old Estonian Legation in swank Brunnsparken . They raced around Helsinki in Russian autos . Their boss was smart , rugged Colonel General Andrei Alexandrovich Zhdanov , Leningrad 's Communist chief and Stalin 's heir apparent . In the thick of last week 's crisis , General Zhdanov suddenly zoomed off to Moscow , then zoomed back , presumably bringing Stalin 's latest word to the Finns . What it might be Finns would soon find out .
