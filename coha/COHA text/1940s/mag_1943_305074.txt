<P> For three months Seattle 's Boeing Airplane Co. has been frantically hunting for 9,000 more workers to boost lagging Flying Fortress production ( TIME , Aug. 2 , et seq . ) . Scouts were dispatched into the Middle West to lure workers to Boeing ; the War Manpower Commission asked Puget Sound shipyards to lay off some 14,000 men ; patriotic Seattlites went from door to door begging housewives to take jobs ; a giant rally was held in the University of Washington stadium . Result : last week Boeing was swamped , had to turn job-seekers away . Boeing still needs some 5,000 to 6,000 workers , but job-seekers simply poured in too fast for assimilation until certain job classifications are built up and new production schedules go into effect . Thus Boeing was in the excruciating position of a starving , toothless man being offered a thick steak .
