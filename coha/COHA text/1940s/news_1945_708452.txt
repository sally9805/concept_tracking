txt So many requests are being received about the terms of the Halpern Dog License Bill that a brief explanation may be helpful . The bill has for its purposes the elimination of the A. S. P. C. A. and other animal welfare societies in New York City from interfering with a proposed monopoly by the municipal government in matters relating to lost , strayed , homeless , abandoned , improperly kept or even unwanted dogs or cats . This involves transferring the doglicensing function entrusted to the society by the State Legislature in 1894 to the municipal government . Since the law became effective every penny above the cost of collecting , recording and distributing the licenses has been devoted entirely to care and protection of animals  --  a situation which is almost unprecedented . The five large shelters of the society and the administration building were erected at a cost of more than a million dollars , none of which came from license money . The society has been willing to continue the administration of the license law because it feels that it can do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That intangible , heartfelt interest in the kindly and intelligent care of animals is more likely to be found in those whose sole function is animal protection rather than in a city department with ever-changing administration . The eighty years ' experience in handling unfortunate animals would be lost and the organization that started the entire humane movement in this hemisphere would be outlawed . Perhaps the bill was introduced ' because of a mistaken notion that the society profited by the dollar or more a day charged by private veterinarians for quarantining dogs under the very drastic quarantine resolution of the Board of Health . The society has nothing to do with fixing or collecting that fee . The society set up quarters in a city building in the Bronx for such quarantining and charged 10 cents a day , admitted dogs free when people could not pay , until the building was taken away and the Mayor declared no other city building could be used for that purpose . It is taking dogs up to the limit of its facilities for quarantine now at 10 cents a day from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not locate buildings where several thousand dogs could be housed , even if it could obtain the equipment and the manpower . But it has and will continue to work for the " poor kid 's dog " and thus help to correct the discriminatory provision in the resolution of the Board of Health which favors those who have funds to pay a veterinarian . In his letter in THE NEW YORK TIMES Arnold Whitridge criticized the Greek patriots of Earn , who fought the Axis effectively for the last three years . His letter added nothing new to Mr. Churchill 's well-known arguments . He asserted that in the recent events in Greece " the issue was not enlighten/vent versus reaction , " that " the King was not an important factor in the revolt , " that Elas wanted to seize power by armed force , and so on . All this is history . The Varkisa agreement signed by the Greek Government and Earn on Feb. 12 is the best evidence that Earn is an important factor in the present and future political life of the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is your correspondent 's insinuation that " any story " favorable to Earn " is antiBritish . " The fact is that Eam sympathizers in Greece and in this country , though strongly disagreeing with Mr. Churchill 's Greek policy , are the real friends of Great Britain and in line with the opinion of the overwhelming majority of the British people , as reflected in a recent article of The London Economist ( Dec. 23 , 1944 ) , from which I quote : " The second Commons debate on Greece was disappointing . Few people spoke . The attendance by no means reflected the concern in the country , and the Labor spokesmen * * * failed to clarify the issues and call from the Government an acceptable statement on policy . * * * The two weeks of fighting and negotiating have exploded the false picture of the Greek situation given by Mr. Churchill in such unfortunate terms in the first debate on Greece . The Earn is not a band of ruffians and brigands . It is a large , popular movement . The Earn as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts ) certainly did not plan a Communist coup d'etat. * " Finally , the real issue is not communism at all . It is the monarchy . " It is unfortunate indeed that irresbonsible talking and writing in this country tends to defame those who sacrificed their all in this war for the cause of freedom and democracy and to create disunity among the Allies , unity being impossible without truth and understanding . It usually takes the form of a story about an American couple who visit Canada , purchase butter without ration points and return to the United States to find the butter marked " U. S. Lend-Lease . " The story , like so many of its kind , is completely false for the following reasons : 1 . Canada receives no lend-lease aid of any kind from the United States ; on the contrary , Canada herself lend-leases her own war materials on a very large scale . 2 . No United States butter of any kind is on sale in Canada . 3 . Canada rations butter , currently at the rate of six ounces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anniversary of Korea 's Declaration of Independence . While Korea has yet to achieve freedom , her 26-year-old declaration remains a historic document , written , as it were , in blood and expressing the will and the faith of her 26,000,000 people . The more I study the tragic history of the Korea of this past twenty-six years , the more I am struck by America 's influence upon Korea 's will to win : First of all , America has helped Korea to become freedom-conscious through her missionaries . Throughout the years of Japan 's brutal misrule these missionaries did their utmost to . stay out of political activities . But when freedom of worship was at stake , they fought for it with characteristic stubbornness . This has taught the Koreans that freedom is worth fighting for . Secondly , and of even greater significance , is America 's contribution through the education of Korean youth . Modern education at institutions in . Korea was initiated by the Americans . America has opened her arms to Koreans seeking an education within her borders . Although the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own countrymen was immense . The man who is now universally recognized as the " father of the reform movement in Korea " received his education at Johns Hopkins University . Korea 's first Provisional President received his degrees ' from Harvard and Princeton . America 's historic good-will is very much in evidence today . The issuance of Korean stamps by the United States Government as a tribute to Korea 's heroic stand against Japan ; American participation in the Cairo Declaration , which stated that Korea should ultimately become free and independent ; the recognition by the American press of Korea 's indomitable spirit of independence , and the readiness of the American people to assist Korea in maintaining an independent existence when her freedom is restored . The recently organized American Foundation for Korean Education is a fine example . Shortly after the Cairo Declaration in 1943 , a group of distinguished American educators met in Princeton to discuss ways and means to help the Koreans rebuild their devastated country when Japanese tyranny was brought to an end . Subsequent conferences led them to the conclusion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many Korean young men and women as possible in technical , medical and other scientific fields , so that Korea , in the post-war period , may have the benefit of their services . As a result of these conferences , the American Foundation for Korean Education was organized early this year . As the Koreans gather together again in this free nation on March 1 of this year to observe the day , and we hope this will be the last time before our enemies are brought to their knees , they are conscious , as never before , of American good-will and America 's hope for a speedy return to their freed land . Those of us who attend matinees in town and travel by bus would welcome a change in the hour for the curtain . Why not go back to the old time-2 or even 2:15 ? Then we would be able to get seats in buses and not conflict with commuters , who should have the first right to be accommodated . This would move the hour of the evening performance forward , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over in time for a night club even with midnight curfew . And I am sure all those connected with the theatre would welcome a few more hours of sleep .
