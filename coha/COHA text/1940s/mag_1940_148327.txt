Franklin Roosevelt was in a jubilant mood as he received reporters for his press conference one day last week . Chuckling as he read from a memorandum written by Economic Adviser Lauchlin Currie-occasionally remarking : " The Republicans will have a hard time answering that one . " " This will come as quite a shock to some people " - he listed several highly mathematical reasons why the U. S. is not going broke . He repeated one of them three times , not from the memo but from memory . As unanimously reported by the correspondents present it ran : From 1932 to 1939 , decreases in State , county and local debts were enough to offset increases in Federal debt . <P> Next day Candidate Thomas Dewey claimed he had turned up a whopping error in the President 's figures . Quoting New Deal scripture ( an AAA study ) , he showed that , while State , county and local debts had fallen only $130 millions , Federal debt had increased some $21 billions . And even if the President had included the big drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still be making an error of $9 billions . <P> The President 's retort : As for those $9 billions , the AAA report had been mis taken , had made certain duplications . <P> Counting in private indebtedness , losses and gains canceled out . Of course , he had meant to include private indebtedness . If papers had not made that clear , it was the reporters ' fault . Mr. Currie 's memo proved it . Remembering how the President had wandered from the memo , the reporters thought but did not say : " That 's right , you 're wrong . "
