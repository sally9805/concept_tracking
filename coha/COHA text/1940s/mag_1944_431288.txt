Y ou automatically measure a book 's price in terms of your purse , but do you measure the contents in terms of your present and future needs ? Do you know your book size ? There are n't big books and small books . There are only well-fitting books . You alone can take the measurements . Behind the drawn curtains of your inmost thoughts , you can , without embarrassment , try on these printed garments . Do n't let the subtle salesmanship of public opinion intrude . You are the final judge . Keep yourself free to measure and choose . Take a look at the books on your shelves . How many of them actually fit you ? How many do you regret having bought , knowing what you know about them now ? If you are not satisfied with your average , it is good household economy to stop buying books until you feel sure of your ability to improve it . In buying a book , you are adding to the wardrobe of the mind . Why have a hundred unwearables taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless it fits . See the book , decide whether or not it is for you , and then , but not until then , buy it . Now to get down to those measurements , the discovery of your present and future book needs . Let us try on a few , keeping in mind that no two people are the same , that the size is in you , not in the book . Need and size are one and the same . Let us go into a bookstore in an average city such as Albany , Dayton , Des Moines , Salt Lake City , or Pasadena , and look around . Here on the first table as we go in is a pile of a current best-seller . The critics and your friends have praised it highly . Pick up a copy , read the jacket blurb , read a page or two of the text . Look at the price , two-fifty or three dollars . Put the book down . Move over to the shelves where you will find fiction reprints . These were best-sellers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to paper , binding , and typography ; in fact , they are the same , but the price is one dollar instead of two-fifty or three . You bought a few of them at the original price . Do n't get sore . There is a good reason for the discrepancy . The bookseller will be glad to explain this economic mystery if you want to know the technical details . You paid for Timeliness when you bought originally . If the novel amused you and kept you up on the latest literary event , you got your money 's worth . If you do n't think so , you did n't buy the book to fit . You could have read a circulating-or public-library copy . Then , if you still wanted to own the book , you could have waited till now , when you can have it for one dollar . The same goes for that novel we just looked at on the first table . If you must own it now , go back and buy it . But remember , you have made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiction but to current non-fiction ? the " quickies " produced by war correspondents , ambassadors , lady journalists , and planners of tomorrow 's peace . In making the measurement of Timeliness , allow for a margin of error . You may regret the purchase a year from now . Do n't . The hat you wore last year looked pretty good then . Now let us move along to the shelves of Classics . We wo n't find such a sign , but we will find a more or less complete collection of classics , old and new , represented in the Modern Library , Everyman 's Library , and , in some stores , the Oxford Classics and the Loeb Classical Library . These inexpensive editions , supplemented by stock items not in any of the series . constitute the source of selection for one of the major departments of your own home library . This is the Cultural department with a capital C.  | Your Cultural measurements are the most difficult to make . You have to do a good deal of soul searching here . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid disappointment . ( Remember , we are what we are , and that 's that . ) Let 's follow it out by the case method . Take as an example the Discourses of Epictetus . There is an Everyman 's Library edition , English translation only . The Loeb Classical Library edition has the original Greek on the left and the most recent English translation on the facing page . This description alone may have driven you away from the book forever . But examine the forces that are at work to make you want to own the book . AT SOME time in your life you may have read Arnold Bennett 's popular book , How To Live on 24 Hours a Day . It has been a source of inspiration to countless Britishers and Americans , who have pulled their minds out of the ordinary ruts of living . Bennett says that he never was without a copy of Epictetus close at hand . Epictetus appears on the much-publicized list of " One Hundred Best Books " prepared at St. John 's College in Maryland and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extolled by Mortimer Adler in How To Read a Book and by Mark Van Doren in his recent Liberal Education . If you came under the influence of any or all of these endorsements of the Discourses of Epictetus , you have been led nearer to a buying frame of mind . At any moment you may succumb . Let us say that you still are holding out . The very sound of the author 's name and the title of the book are formidable . But here we are in that bookstore in Dayton or Buffalo and you have in your hand a copy of the Discourses and Encheiridion of Epictetus , by Arrian . The words of Bennett , Van Doren , Adler , or some teacher you had in the dim past are vaguely bouncing around in your subconscious . You do n't really intend to buy , but you open the book anyway . You read a little of the text . It is not over your head , and you are surprised . You then turn to the introduction and learn that this book preserves the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonged to one of Nero 's bodyguards and later was set free . Epictetus himself wrote nothing . The book was written by his disciple , Arrian , and preserves the teachings of Epictetus , just as Plato preserved the teachings of Socrates . You begin to suspect that this may be good , sound , practical philosophy ; a philosophy that worked for others may work for you . If yours has been a rigid background and you have learned that you ca n't throw over tradition , you may respond understandingly when you discover that Epictetus was one of the great teachers of Stoicism . You feel that this book may fit your need for more roots in the past . Its antiquity may no longer prejudice you when you realize that it was written about the same time the New Testament was coming into being . Other considerations , known only to you , may enter in . You may hope that your husband or children will read the book if you have it around . In the end , you buy it . You have learned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the measurement of Permanence . This is the - measurement that has been made autcmatically for generations among those who buy the Bible or Shakespeare . Apply the test to any of the classics ? Home- . Aristotle , Pascal , Goethe , Moliere , and hundreds of others . Timeliness in the department of current books and Permanence in the cultural department are followed natural by Utility in the tool department . Her : we have the dictionaries , encyclopedia atlases , histories , books of science , home economics , sociology , government , coo ; : books , books of self-help , books of etiquette . You may have to stretch a bit - read some of the classics . You may have to put up with boredom to keep abreast of the current effusions you decide you need ; but a tool to do its work should be comfortable in order to be useful . If you prefer to read Junior 's elementary textbook on the history of the United States . by all means read it , and with apologies to no one . You want the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on from there . In the matter of encyclopedias , for instance , you do n't have to lay out a fortune to get one of the best . And you do n't have to wade through endless technical discussions to get at the facts you wanPerhaps a one-volume encyclopedia will do . This does not imply that the large encyclopedias will not fit your needs . One of them may be the very tool you wanKeep one important fact in mind , however , when buying : the subscription book : business , through which most multivolume sets are sold , usually operates with a provision of 20 percent of the price for bad debts and collections . That has its bearing on your budget . Remember . too , that there is a saying among subscription book salesmen that " books are sold , not bought . " The same goes for the pretty but expensive sets designed to make every American boy and girl a Quiz Kid , or King Solomons out of their fathers . . TO PRESERVE your freedom in picking a book that fits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy . You are freer to do this in a bookstore , or in buying by mail from a catalogue of many titles , than you are in buying from one man with only one thing to sell . - We are still in that store in Dayton at the reference counter . It might be a good idea to place all orders for books through a bookstore , if there is one handy . Either stop in and look around or order by mail after looking over catalogues and bookreview sections of the newspapers . Ask to be placed on your bookseller 's mailing list . It is his business to keep you posted and to get you anything in print . To preserve freedom of choice , develop a good , healthy sales resistance to all " canned sales talks , " whether they are directed at you verbally or in the form of mail-order copy .
