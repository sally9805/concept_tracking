You are about to enter Dogpatch , an average stone-age community , It nestles in a bleak valley , between two cheap and uninteresting hills . . . <P> On this low prefatory note , Comic-Stripper Al Capp introduced his glorified comic book , The Life &; Times of the Shmoo ( Simon &; Schuster ; $1 ) , published Dec. 2 . By last week , The Shmoo had sold 133,752 copies . It was far outselling the No. 1 nonfiction bestseller , Robert E. Sherwood 's Roosevelt &; Hopkins-which cost six times as much and was at least six times as hard to read . <P> The shmoo is a friendly , fruitful , gourd-shaped animal that wandered into Al Capp 's Li'l Abner last summer ( TIME , Sept. 13 ) . Its Life &; Times was simply a reprint of funny-paper strips , plus a weekend 's work by Capp on extra drawings to make Dogpatch only reasonably unintelligible to readers venturing there for the first time . Asking nothing of the world , the shmoo gave everything : butter , milk , eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , suspender buttons ( of shmoo eyes ) . Wherever shmoos went-and they multiplied like speeded-up guinea pigs-no one had to work any more . Capitalists thought this a menace , so Pork Tycoon J. Roaringham Fatback sent " shmooicide squads " to wipe out the shmoo . They succeeded , except for two shmoon ( pl. ) , boy &; girl , which Li'l Abner saved for Capp 's future use . <P> Super-Animal . The miracle of Dogpatch had become a greater national phenomenon than Lena the Hyena ; culturally it had surpassed even Sadie Hawkins day . To New York Herald Tribune Radio Columnist John Crosby , who thought he detected a likeness between the whiskered shmoo and a certain Chicago newspaper publisher , the book was " one of the finest satiric creations since Gulliver 's Travels . " ( No , said Capp modestly , that was overrating Dean Swift . ) To Dr. Frederic Wertham , a Manhattan psychiatrist who crusades against comic books , the shmoo offered " a solution of human problems on the same spurious level as Nietzsche 's superman or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ super-animal . " <P> Wrote an awed reviewer in the New York Times , with just a tongue-tip in cheek : " We should not be surprised to hear . . . that the intellectuals had discovered Mr. Capp 's opera , and that words like dichotomy , plangent and ambivalent were being thrown at him , wrapped in pages from Kafka and Dostoevski . . . The Life &; Times of the Shmoo is a cultural event of enormous significance . " <P> In his Boston studio , Cartoonist Capp , a sort of Rabelais in modern dress , pretended that these enormous implications were lost on him . " My first sensation , " he said , " was just the joy of having made the shmoo . Then came a feeling of annoyance . I 've been subjected to all the shmoo jokes in the world , like ' there 's good shmoos tonight , ' and I must n't say go-to-hell to anybody . Now I 'm delighted again , having read that the shmoo has all sorts of economic meanings . "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
