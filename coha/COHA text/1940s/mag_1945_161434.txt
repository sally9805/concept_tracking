The bite of a black-widow spider , which is common all over the U.S. , is seldom fatal-but the pain is well-nigh unbearable . The victim suffers from something called arachnidism . He thrashes around in agony for one or two days , hurts for several more . His abdomen becomes as rigid as a board . His legs draw up in a series of spasms . None of the 60 remedies so far recommended by the medical books gives very notable relief from the spider 's bite . <P> When a Negro boy in Charleston , S.C . was bitten , the doctors began running through the usual drugs . But 45 minutes after the injection of calcium gluconate , the boy still cried out with pain . After another shot he seemed to get worse . A slow injection of salt and sugar was no help ; pentobarbital sodium , codeine and Aspirin left him still twitching on the bed . Pentobarbital sodium was tried again , to no effect . <P> After six and a half hours , Dr. James E. Bell Jr . decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relax contracted muscles in polio and arthritis ( TIME , Jan. 15 ) and a shot of atropine . In 15 minutes the bitten boy 's abdomen began to soften , his legs relaxed a little . In an hour he was comfortable except for a slight headache .
