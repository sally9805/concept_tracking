There was no doubt that domineering , salt-crusted Patrick J. McHugh had tight control over Massachusetts ' fishing fleet . The 4,200 members of his independent Atlantic Fishermen 's Union manned practically every sizeable trawler , dragger and gill-netter that sailed out of New Bedford , Gloucester and Boston . The union had its own selling rooms in Gloucester and New-Bedford , and dictated who could and who could not buy there . <P> When prices dropped after the war , and with them the fishermen 's take-home pay ( based on a share in the profits ) , McHugh ordered each boat to limit its catch , in an effort to bolster the market . Crews that disobeyed were fined , or kept on the beach . The Federal Government refused to interfere , citing the exemption of unions from prosecution for trade monopoly under the Norris-LaGuardia Act . Then the union went a step further , ordered crews to refuse to sell fish for less than the former OPA prices . <P> Last week McHugh and his union found they had run hard aground on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was State Attorney General Clarence A. Barnes . Barnes , at 64 , still has the bearing ( and the crew haircut ) of a Yale athlete* ( class of ' 04 ) , still thoughtfully putts golf balls around his office when mulling over a problem . Twice married and the father of nine children ( the oldest , 40 , the youngest , two ) , he has had a distinguished career as a lawyer and a militant Republican . His bill requiring labor unions to account publicly for their funds was the country 's first to be approved by voters ( in a state referendum last year ) . <P> Determined to break Pat McHugh 's stranglehold , Barnes charged that the union constituted an illegal monopoly under the state 's laws . Superior Court Justice Edward T. Broadhurst agreed . The dispute , he found , was not a labor dispute between the union and employers , but a business matter between the union and the buyers .
