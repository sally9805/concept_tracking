txt Calling In the Law IRVING SCHWARTZ . DRAMA MAILBAG Calling In the Law To the Drama Editor : I AGREE that some action should be taken by the Commissioner of Licenses in New York to prevent actual deceit and fraud by box office treasurers , especially with mail orders . I have seldom received tickets by mail in a location I requested . Recently I ordered tickets for the circus before it opened , and requested a certain location , for any evening during the run of the show . I definitely stated that I wanted my enclosed check returned in the stamped , addressed envelope , if this location was not available . I received located several sections away . Upon returning the tickets with a threat to complain to the Commissioner of Licenses , I was sent the location I wanted , with a weak explanation about inefficiency of employes . I suggest that the Commissioner of Licenses compel theatres to display their seating arrangements prominently in the lobby . Also all orders for tickets , especially by mail , should be filled as requested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purchaser . This practice on mail orders . may actually constitute fraudulent use of the mails. "
