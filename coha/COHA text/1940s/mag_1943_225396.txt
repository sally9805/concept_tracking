To answer some of the questions our subscribers have been asking about how TIME gathers , verifies , writes and distributes its news . <P> How do you address an archduke ? <P> How many U.S. troops were in Europe on Christmas Day 1917 ? <P> Which way does a Sikh wind his turban ? <P> How many pounds of meat have been Lend-Leased ? <P> Where are most U.S. hops grown ? <P> How many rupees a month does an American soldier in India get ? <P> How many square miles of U.S. territory are now in enemy hands ? <P> How much did American investors lose on defaulted foreign bonds from 1919 to 1929 ? <P> How does the infant mortality rate in Quebec compare with that in Bombay ? <P> What is the gestation period of a cow ? <P> These ten questions are not a guessing game for subscribers or even an intelligence test . They are just a sample of the 1,300 questions a week that have to be answered for the editors of TIME , LIFE and FORTUNE . <P> One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trained researcher each of them has at his elbow-ready to dig out the added facts he needs to write confidently and to make his story tight and precise , without fudging points where his memory is vague . But our researchers would often be at their wits ' end for answers without the model reference library we have been building up for them over the past twenty years . <P> When TIME began in 1923 the library contained just three books-the Bible , Xenophon 's Anabasis , and the Iliad . The index was a set of scrapbooks into which a red-headed office boy pasted TIME 's news stories . And the " morgue " was simply a batch of clippings the editor carried in his pocket when he went to the printers each week to correct the final proofs . <P> The three books which formed TIME 's original library have grown to more than 20,000-and heaven knows how many millions of newspaper clippings , magazine articles and TIME research reports are now filed away in 300,000 folders in the morgue . Once we weighed a filing cabinet with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all some 23,280 pounds of news-facts stored away , including 250,000 biographical folders to help our editors tell the news in terms of the people who make it . <P> Every four weeks some 15,000 new items are added and 10,000 out-of-date ones are thrown away to keep the walls of the TIME &; LIFE Building from bursting . To save space we keep newspapers on microfilm-800 pages on a roll the size of a sardine tin . <P> Running TIME 's reference library keeps 33 librarians and helpers busy full time under tall Smith-alumna Virginia Smucker , who worked for two college libraries before she came to TIME six years ago . Her staff never ceases to wonder at the amazing questions thrown at them day after day-but day after day they take all comers in their stride . And so if you sometimes feel that the background facts in TIME 's stories are especially sharp and clear , I think you ought to know that these people ( whose names never show up in type ) should get a lot of the credit . <P> Cordially ,   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
