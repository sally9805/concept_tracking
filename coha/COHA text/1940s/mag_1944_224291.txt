One of the world 's brightest diplomatic stars , Turkey 's Foreign Minister Numan Rifat Menemencioglu ( pronounced approximately many-men ' - chaw- glue ) , went into eclipse last week . The latest play in Turkey 's shrewd neutrality game , which he had managed skillfully since 1942 , forced him to retire . <P> The Wily Turk . Throughout the war years , Menemencioglu has been guilty only of being pro-Turkish . To that endeavor , he brought his father 's knowledge of politics , the burning patriotism of his grandfather , Namik Kemal . <P> Namik Kemal was one of the leaders of the Tanzimatists , founders of the 19th-Century Young Turks , who first began modernizing their country and turning its ideas westward . <P> Namik Kemal 's son , Mehmed Rifat , a powerful politician , president of the Senate , and for a time Minister of Finance , sent his son Numan to a French lyce , then to Lausanne to study law . World War I was under way when Numan became third secretary of the Turkish legation at Vienna . <P> By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1929 as a departmental head , foreign attaches already knew this sick young man with an abscessed lung and deficient hearing as a cold , hard , calculating bargainer . When , 22 months ago , Numan 's gradual ascent up the Foreign Office ladder brought him to the top rung as Minister , no one was surprised . <P> To his people at home and in the Kamutay ( Grand National Assembly ) , he was already known as the hero of the Hatay . <P> The 1923 treaty of Lausanne , fixing the country 's borders , set up the small sanjak ( sub-prefecture ) of Alexandretta , between Syria and Turkey , as an " autonomous " region under French control . To the Turks , this Levantine Sudetenland , which they called the Hatay , was a symbol of humiliation . In 1939 , Menemencioglu used France 's fear of war and need of an ally to win back the Hatay for Turkey , thus forever endearing himself to all Turks . <P> As Foreign Minister , Menemencioglu did not always endear himself to opposing diplomats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lung ailment during diplomatic conversations , failing to hear what did not suit him , throwing tantrums in the midst of serious conversations , stalking away to " recuperate . " <P> Too often for his own comfort , these illnesses were not feigned . Nineteen times in the last 20 years , Menemencioglu submitted to surgical operations , thrice having platinum ribs inserted in his body . Even this hard-case record was chalked up against him by some adversaries who knew that his personal surgeon was a German , General Professor Ferdinand Sauerbruch . <P> The Squeeze . The curious fact is that Turkey did the Allies a great service in the early war years by staying neutral . A German invasion of Turkey , when Britain was barely able to hold Egypt and Suez , might have been disastrous . Last week , when Anthony Eden ( who reportedly dislikes Menemencioglu ) complained that German warships , disguised as merchantmen , had been allowed to cruise through Turkey 's Dardanelles , Ankara had to give in . Numan Menemencioglu took the fall , handed over his portfolio to Premier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for a very long count .
