This week 12,000 men begin ringing the doorbells of U. S. business , and , unlike book salesmen , they can not be kicked out . At the executives of great corporations as well as at flabbergasted peanut vendors they will fire their questions . What is your business ? Are you incorporated ? What were your total receipts during 1939 ? Cost of materials ? Wage payments ? How much did you sell on credit ? These snoopers are taking the business , manufacturing , mines &; quarries section of the Sixteenth Decennial Census of the U. S. The population , housing , and farm sections will be taken during April . <P> The curiosity behind all this snooping is not that of the snoopers nor even primarily of the Government , but of those who will have to put up with the snooping-businessmen . Advertising firms , mail-order houses , Chambers of Commerce , business analysts have long complained that there are no satisfactory figures on marketing , credit , unemployment , etc . Though production censuses have been going on since 1810 , the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholesaling , construction , service industries , etc. ) was conducted under Herbert Hoover in 1930 . The only ones since then , in 1933 and 1935 , were unsatisfactory because businessmen were requested but not compelled to answer the questions . When a census taker asks a question , a businessman answers or may be fined $100 and put away for 60 days . <P> For the 1940 Census , Director Austin and his bright idea-man Vergil Reed claim these improvements : <P> &gt; By a question , " date of original establishment of this business in this city , " the Census will determine the birthrate of U. S. business . <P> &gt; Manufacturers used to be asked merely for the number of wage earners engaged in production . This year 's census will also determine the number engaged in distribution and other activities , also their sex . <P> &gt; The Census will ask wholesalers for tabulations of all goods they have sold during the year ; among retail stores , which handle myriads of items , it will classify general categories . <P> &gt; Companies will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used plants , new and used machinery and operating equipment . <P> &gt; Instead of asking for inventories as of one date , businessmen will be required to state their inventories as of the beginning and end of the year , thus registering the year 's inventory change-a favorite plaything of statisticians . <P> &gt; The familiar and crude census of the " gainfully occupied ' ' will be made more searching by a long list of questions : during the week of March 24-30 were you employed , if so was it with private industry or Government agency ? If unemployed , since when ? Were you seeking work ? Have you had previous experience ? Was your unemployment due to vacation , illness , or strike ? <P> &gt; Housing , totally neglected in previous years , will get a thorough quizzing-age and condition of houses , materials used in their construction , persons per room , rent , mortgages , household appliances , number of privies . <P> &gt; Salaries and wages received by families as well as individuals will , when combined with house values and home-grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
