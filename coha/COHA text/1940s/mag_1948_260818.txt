No one knew how long the Berlin airlift would be needed . From the strictly economic viewpoint , the operation has been likened to carrying coal in a gold scuttle . But the U.S. Air Force last week took a step that was unmistakably businesslike . At the airbase at Great Falls , Mont. , it opened a replacement training school for airlift pilots . A " little corridor " will be laid out on the surrounding plains , matching the 20-mile-wide lanes into Berlin . Traffic controls and communications will duplicate those in Germany . Training will include night and all-weather flying . <P> The Air Force was missing no bets . In a deal with the airlines , it offered temporary jobs in the Berlin airlift to commercial pilots laid off during the slack winter season . It expected 100 to 200 experienced C-54 pilots to accept . It was also dickering for the return of 40 C-54s leased to the airlines at war 's end .                    @
