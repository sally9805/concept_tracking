" I was home eating my junior food , " said K. C. Adams , editor of the Mine Workers Journal . " It 's already chewed-lamb and vegetables , chopped liver and prunes and applesauce that looks like gunpowder . " Mr. Adams has a delicate stomach . " I asked Lillie Mrs. Adams to fix me some tea . She made it out of one of those little tea balls . " Mr. Adams made the motions of gently dipping a tea ball into a cup , " ' Lillie , ' I said , ' this tea with no leaves wo n't do me no good . I need the leaves and a gypsy to go with them . ' " <P> Mr. Adams had just got the news : the Supreme Court had decided that his boss , John L. Lewis , was in contempt of court . Mr. Adams and the rest of the U.S. could only try to divine , with or without tea leaves , what would happen next . <P> Appropriate Decision . Mr. Adams could remember clearly the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring , after a 59-day coal strike , the Government had seized the nation 's soft-coal mines and made a contract with Lewis . But six months later John L. decided that he wanted a better deal . When the Government said that the contract could not be reopened , Lewis said the agreement was off , threatened to strike . <P> Federal Judge T. Alan Goldsborough tried to restrain Lewis until the question of his right to call off the contract could be settled by the courts . Goldsborough ordered him . not to call the strike . Lewis called the strike anyhow , arguing that the Norris-LaGuardia Act took away the court 's authority to enjoin workers in a labor dispute . Obediently his miners , nearly 600,000 of them , walked out . Goldsborough convicted him of contempt and the case went to the Supreme Court . <P> Now the decision was in , handed down , surprisingly , on a Thursday afternoon . Monday is usually " judgment day " in the U.S. Supreme Court . But the opinions of the justices were written , and Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a watchful press . <P> Goldsborough had fined Lewis $10,000 . The Court upheld that . He had fined the union $3,500,000 . The Court reduced that to $700,000 , on condition that Lewis withdraw his new strike threat . <P> It was one of the worst blows a leader and his union had taken in the history of U.S. labor . In the case of John Lewis , who has ridden contemptuously over the Government , over the public , over his own labor colleagues and even over his own mine workers , the verdict was peculiarly appropriate . But the decision went beyond Lewis . It stirred up the tea leaves in all of organized labor 's cup . <P> The Interests of Government . A court which is not noted for its unanimity of opinion followed a fairly clear line on the main question of Lewis ' guilt . Justice Wiley Rutledge dissented . He belabored Goldsborough for his failure to draw a clear line between civil and criminal contempt-on both of which counts Goldsborough had held Lewis culpable . " No case in this Court heretofore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rutledge wrote . He and Justice Murphy both thought that Goldsborough should be reversed . <P> But the other seven justices agreed that Lewis was wrong in defying the district court , no matter whether or not the court had any legal right-under the Norris-La-Guardia Act-to order him not to strike .
