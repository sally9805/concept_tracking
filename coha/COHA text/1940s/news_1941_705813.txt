txt The arrests and executions in France evoke scenes from the Paris Commune of 1871 and the Reign of Terror of a century and a half ago . The very place names mentioned in today 's dispatches , the Eleventh Arondissement , lying just beyond the Place Bastille , impel comparison of the old with this new Reign of Terror . The original Reign of Terror was confined to Paris and a few of the French provinces . Today 's Reign of Terror has spread over the whole of Europe and reached into Africa and Asia . For the arrests and executions in Paris can only remind us once again of the true state of affairs in every city and land under the Nazi heel . They remind us that Hitler 's New Order everywhere rests on fear , and on fear alone . There is no real acceptance of it , no willing cooperation with it , among the masses of the peoples it enslaves . The only " collaboration " they give is the collaboration of the citizen who turns his money and watch over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackjack . In some cases , unfortunately , it is the collaboration of men who betray their friends in the hope of saving their own necks . The heads of subject states can no doubt be forced to talk constantly of collaboration . They may even believe that they achieve some temporary advantage not only for themselves but for their countries by playing this ignominious role . But their own statements reveal that the collaboration they advocate with their conquerors and azainqt their former allies is not supported by their own peoples . Marshal Pdtain has repeatedly admitted by implication that his course does not have this support . He declares that he " hopes to get it . " Meanwhile he is forced to announce that " either one is for me or against me . " He is forced to demand oaths of allegiance to himself , to threaten and order the arrest of those who oppose his policy , and to silence opposition by force . He has admitted openly that French " public opinion has not always been favorable " to the anti-British Admiral Dalian . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of collaboration can be put down only by the increasing use of force is a sign of the growing strength of that opposition . In Paris the German and French Nazis resort to their usual trick of attributing all acts of sabotage to Jews , and the reverse trick of calling all opponents of the regime Jews . In fact , the Eleventh Arondissement , where the bulk of the arrests have been made , is a radical district but not one with a large Jewish population . No doubt it contains Communists who were unwilling to fight for France when France was armed more than a year ago , but are willing to fight now because of the reversal of German relations with Communist Russia : Whatever else the Paris , arrests and executions mean , they prove once more , if proof were needed , that the unified Europe of which Hitler boasts is a myth . Wherever the New Order has penetrated it has brought impoverishment , hatred , disease and starvation . There will be revolt within it wherever there is even a glimmer of hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
