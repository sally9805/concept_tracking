In Washington last week war hung like a thundercloud over the 24th annual meeting of the American Council on Education . Representatives of the 534 schools and teachers ' associations were told about the effects of war on youth-as they have been in Britain , as they are developing in the U.S. , as they are likely to be when war is over . <P> The Story in Britain . Harvard 's gentle , alert President James Bryant Conant , who tripped to Britain last March for President Roosevelt , told what 19 months of mobilization had done to Britain 's universities . <P> &gt; Male enrollment in universities outside London was down 15% last year , this year dropped another 20 or 25% . By next year British universities will have less than 50% of normal enrollment . <P> &gt; Britain 's pool of trained men in " reserved occupations " includes some 200,000 doctors , architects , physicists , chemists and other university men , is replenished by allowing students in these technical categories to carry on with their studies . <P> &gt; All private research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So badly needed are scientists for war work that students get no more than two or three years ' training . <P> &gt; Britain still hopes to let nonscientific students ( social sciences , arts &; letters ) get a year at college to give them a taste of university life , preserve the liberal foundation of British civilization . <P> Students v. Draft . Francis J. Brown , the Council 's consultant on national defense , reported that in the U.S. : <P> &gt; If local boards follow the recommendation of Brigadier General Lewis B. Hershey , Deputy Director of Selective Service , they will give blanket deferment to all students above the class of sophomore . <P> &gt; Certain students in fields essential to national defense may , as in Britain , get occupational deferment . <P> Planning for Peace . Dr. Floyd Wesley Reeves , small , balding director of the Council 's American Youth Commission , director of labor supply and training for the Office of Production Management , raised the question : What will happen to some 4,000,000 young people from 16 to 25 who ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor in school when the war emergency ends ? Many U.S. youths of these ages are now either serving in the Army &; Navy or employed in defense industries . The Administration 's expected solutions of this post-war idleness : <P> &gt; Bigger Federal work programs to care for " several hundred thousand " young people leaving school each year . <P> &gt; Federal agencies to provide technical training for students , supplementing the general education offered by schools . <P> &gt; In addition to public works and conservation projects , youth may be kept busy producing goods for families on relief , building and operating community clubs and playgrounds for themselves . <P> Said Dr. Reeves dryly : " It is ridiculous to have youth unemployed while they themselves need goods and services .
