For 20 days , as Franklin Roosevelt relaxed at Warm Springs , Ga. , Washington D.C. seemed more &; more like an empty stage , its emptiness spotlighted by the news from Europe . Last week , back at the White House , the President faced newsmen , who arrived full of questions and left nearly empty of answers . The New York Times 's Arthur Krock was stirred to an annoyed essay on the House of Commons ' success in extracting information from Winston Churchill . But the President , rested and amiable , spoke his small news with a good-humored air . <P> Franklin Roosevelt had gained a few pounds , and he had more color . Also he had adopted a new word-contentious-and used it freely as he fended off questions on Greece and Poland , and a request that he restate U.S. foreign policy . When the request was repeated the President said , blandly , that the foreign policy was on the record . <P> Elizabeth May Craig , Washington correspondent of a string of Maine newspapers , picked the word up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contentious question , Mr. President , but I would like a serious answer . Are you going to the right or to the left ? " <P> The President said he was going down the old line , a little left of center . That was true eleven and a half years ago and it still holds . But was he going to change from Dr. Win-the-War back to Dr. New Deal when the war ended ? No , no , Franklin Roosevelt said , he was just going a little left of center . Then he laughed . That was n't much of an answer , was it ? Miss Craig agreed tartly : " No . " <P> The Christian Science Monitor 's smart little Roscoe Drummond fished for information on the Big Three Conference , and was told that his question was highly speculative . He cracked back : " I 'd like to eliminate the speculation , sir , and get to the highest source . " The President chuckled . So , he said , would he . <P> Diplomatic Ectoplasm . Then a reporter touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. President , did Mr. Churchill ever sign the Atlantic Charter ? " <P> Nobody , said the President , had ever signed the Atlantic Charter . Then where was it now ? Mr. Roosevelt 's face assumed a lecturer 's look . This is what comes of thinking in banal phrases and banal thoughts , he said . There is n't any copy of the Atlantic Charter . The nearest thing would be the notes given to the radio operators of the U.S.S. Augusta , and H.M.S. Prince of Wales* ( aboard which Roosevelt and Churchill traveled to the Gulf of St. Lawrence in August , 1941 ) . The agreement consisted of little scraps of handwriting . Some of it was the President 's , some Mr. Churchill 's , some Sir Alexander Cadogan 's , some Sumner Welles 's . Anyway it was signed in substance , and four and a half months later , 26 of the United Nations ( including Russia ) had endorsed it . <P> Rhymed Suspicion . This bland explanation disturbed citizens who had expected some day to see the Charter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence . The whole affair seemed very suspicious to such incurably suspicious journals as the Chicago Tribune . The isolationist Tribune published a frontpage color cartoon of F.D.R. fishing , with this jingle :
