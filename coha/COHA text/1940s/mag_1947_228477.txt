Digging up material for a New Jersey almanac , Author Harry B. Weiss ran across the 1818 report of famed English Radical William Cobbett , in A Journal of a Year 's Residence in the United States . Excerpt : " I have just dined upon cold ham , cold veal , butter and cheese and a peach pye ; nice clean room , well furnished , waiter clean and attentive , plenty of milk ; and charge , a quarter of a dollar . I had not the face to pay the waiter a quarter of a dollar ; but gave him half a dollar , and told him to keep the change . "
