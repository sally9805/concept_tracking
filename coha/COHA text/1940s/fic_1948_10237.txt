Mr. William Thomas , the son of a minister from Hill Town , Bucks County , to start a school for boys at Chambersbnrg were pledged forthwith . Captain Jack followed with an appeal that " his young mountain rangers " should continue to receive the tacit support of the frontier Masons as they always had in the past . All his rangers had always been sons of the widow . The promptness , secrecy , and freedom from government which they had enjoyed in the past , and which might again be vital should Indian troubles come , he asked to be continued . He made it plain that he was about to disappear from the scene . " My labours and my mission are o'er . " And if anyone could have doubted this , the halting eloquence from the now toothless mouth , which made his valedictory sound like language already half blown away by the wind , was in itself the proof of his theme . He ended by pointing out Salathiel as the one best qualified to re-rally the " FightingQuakers " , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely be upon us in the nigh and onrushing future . Amen , " said Captain Jack . " The mantle of Elijah has fallen upon you , Brother Albine , " said Arthur St. Clair . There was nothing for it , but under the eyes of Captain Jack and the whole lodge , Salathiel must rise and accept . And to Yates 's delight , he acquitted himself on this important occasion not only modestlybut very well . It was a solemn promise he gave . How reluctant he was to give it , he was at some pains to conceal . The obvious pleasure and affectionate gratitude of his old leader were his immediateand only reward . It was arranged on the side that evening that Captain Jack should accompany him in the wagon as far as Carlisle . The speech of the old partisan and patriot of the mountains was by far the most moving event of the evening , but not the most discussed . What was most immediately stirring and disturbing to the neighbourhood was the growing hostility of many of the younger men to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians , which they roundly denounced . Colonel Chambers complainedand warned of the growing lawlessness of the Black Boys . Captain James Smith , the Callahans , and others from Conococheaguedefended the " taking of necessary measures " , short of taking scalps . A number of members spoke bitterly of having their arms seized and their houses searched by " Captain Grant up at the fort " . His petty tyrannies were generally execrated . Nothing very definite came out of all this . It was not something which the lodge could entirely control . It was quite plain that Injun traders , whether licensed or not , were going to have to reckon with the Black Boys . Owing to the presence of Ensigns McNairn and Erskine from the fort , nothing more was said about dealing withP 201Wully and the royal garrison , except perhaps elliptically by MagistrateMcDowell , who spoke of the sins and the folly of rebellion against authority . Two emissaries from the emigrating congregations then on the way from Carlisle were next heard from , and certain plans for seeing them on their way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them through the winter were gone into . There were many Masons and their families amongst them . Certain letters could be written to lodge No. 12 at Winchester , but not in this case to Colonel Washington , who was sometimes inimical to communications from Pennsylvania , it was thought . The lodge was adjourned as usual , except for a prayer by Mr. Craighead addressed fervently to the common Father of all men , denominated by the minister as the " Lord God of Sabaoth " . It was late , after midnight , when quietly and with as little disturbance as possible the members dispersed themselves , either homeward or amongst the friendly houses of the brethren in the town . Meanwhile , to anyone of a full and sensitive apprehension , to someone with a poetic sixth sense , the feeling and meaning of the meeting might have been sensed from the outside by the sight of the deserted ark and trundler drawn up waiting in the deserted dooryard , and by the cracks of yellow light streaming through tightly closed shutters and gleaming like a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forbidding house . A sound of rushing waters , the steady drift of thin flocks of small white clouds across the face of peeping stars seemed to denote the passing of time in a given direction and from a mysterious source , while inside the sheltered house bearded and apple-cheeked men secretly deliberated . There was a hush , a silence , and a note of disturbance in the rising wind from the north . Southward-bound birds with thin urgent cries passed high as the cloud rack overhead . A change of seasons , a certain apprehensive expectancy was in the air . When Salathiel and Captain Jack finally emerged from the meeting , all this was evident to them and present in feeling , sensitive as they both were to every change and meaning in the weather of the wilderness and the hints in the atmosphere of any natural place . But it was so well understood , and so taken for granted , that neither of them saw fit to comment upon it . They were there ; certain things were going on . The world as always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretly astir . Captain Jack was to sleep that night in the wagon . Melissa and Bridget were tarrying with Ruhannah up at the colonel 's cabin . Women were not expected to be near-by during a lodge meeting , and Ruhannah had especially asked them to stay.  |p202So  , except for Captain Jack , Salathiel shortly after midnight , with the grim mansion finally lightless and deserted , found himself alone . Captain Jack went to bed gladly . He seemed greatly fatigued , indeed all but overcome by the effects of the meeting and the excitement of his farewell speech . After a few jocular comments on the luxurious headquarters bequeathed by the " little captain " , and the follies of fighting Injuns from a palace on wheels , he lay back on Frances ' pillow , swallowed a measure of old Cumberland rye gladly , and after only a few movements of his lips was asleep . Salathiel sat watching him intently by the dim light of a single candle . There was the same large frame outlined by the blanket , but as his sleep became deeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was possible now to look back through the mists of years and to surmise what Captain Jack must have looked like when a boy . It was a strange haunting of age by the lost ghost of youth . Perhaps here was the subtle outward evidence of some returning cycle of the spirit , of that ancient inner person which in sleep always deems itself to be immortal . Perhaps that was returning whence it came . Nymwha had often spoken of this return . He could overhear very old voices when he fasted , he said , speaking wisely of happy summers spent somewhere long ago . By the solemn and single light of the candle such things seemed possible , as he sat gazing at the old hunter 's face in deep silence . There were no traces of trouble there any longer . The countenance was smooth and bland , only a little pitiful about the mouth . Salathiel breathed deeply , which was as near as he ever came to sighing . He thought over the events of the long day . Finally , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do yet , before the day could be called finished . It was the hand . He walked down the row of Colonel Chambers 's sheds until he came to the smoke-house . It was empty , all but for a small pile of hickory chips saved for kindling in a dry corner . A few of these he now arranged in the square pit in the middle of the floor , placing some dry rags amongst them from his tinder box . He struck a few sparks with flint and steel and blew on the glowing patch . In a few minutes the pile of chips began to smoke and smoulder . A blowpipe made from an old gun barrel extended under the sill of the door to the bottom of the fire in the pit . This pipe he now stopped with some clay to regulate the draught until the pile smoked , burning at a slow rate , and exactly satisfactorily . Unwinding a moccasin thong , he suspended the hand by the wrist a few feet above , and directly over , the smoking pit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire-tinged darkness . Clouds of pungent smoke ascended like incense about it . Salathiel took a final look at it , and nodding his head in approbation , closed the door . Twenty-four hours of that steady heat and smoke , and the article would be " presarved " . He went back to the wagon , undressed , and lay down . " Hickory smoke , " muttered Captain Jack , turning over and sniffing . " Ye stink like a Shawanee . " But I 'm not one , thought Salathiel , for all that . Tomorrow I 'm going to the sermon with Frances and Bridget , in decent clothes , and like a Christian man . The smell of wood smoke shall not be upon me . In the smoke-house the hand continued to point downward into the pit.  |p204VERY  EARLY that Sabbath morning Frances and Bridget were back at the wagon . While Captain Jack slept peacefully on , Salathiel slung an iron pot over a small fire and prepared a breakfast of corn mush , roasted potatoes , and sidemeat . This was quickly dispatched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and each other for the great occasion of the morning sermon . Bridget , to be sure , was not much of a help to Frances , except as an ardent supporter and abetter of Melissa 's desire to appear more elegant than anyone else . Salathiel , however , was content for his own reasons to go along . He was pleased to find that not only was Frances not going to object to taking part in a Protestant preaching , but was apparently determined to make the most of it , at least from a worldly and visible standpoint . Of her motives for doing so , he could only surmise . As a matter of fact , they were rather complex , and she did not undertake to explain them . Despite her small chance for indoctrination in the orthodox Roman faith , she remained in her own mind an ardent Catholic . Almosther first certain memory was that of being baptized in The Church at Cork . Her instruction by the nuns there , brief and rudimentaryas it had been , had yet made a profound impression upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was to be persuaded to enter a Protestant place of worship . Above all , she feared listening to the reading of the King James version of the Scriptures . To the English Bible , as the source from which her Protestant and Sassenach oppressors of whatever sect all seemed to draw their strength and inspiration , Frances attributed a magic potency and capacity for ill . She regarded it as the wellspring of heresy and the prime cause of the downfall of the Irish . Besides the moral fascina/tion of the Book , which she had experienced while cogitating by firelightin front of Frazier 's hearth , there was the entrancing and convincingsound of its language . That wizardry remained indelibly in her memory , along with the conviction that she had committed a mortal sin in feeding upon forbidden poetry . To her starving and avid mind the Book had indeed proved a heady and confusing potion . But it was the only book in the cabin  --  and she had read it . Now , this morning , she was actually dressing and preparing to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . She had been caught in the net of her own vanities , perhaps . But she must get along in this world , even at the risk of trouble in the next . She must attain and maintain her respectability , or she was lost here and now . Also she must bring her fine husband along with her ; keep him in his town clothes lest he go back to the woods again . And now there was Bridget ! Bridget , that young limb and splinter of Presbyterian doctrine . She felt an inborn spiritual obstinacy in her already . She both sensed it and feared it . How would it be possible to explain to Bridget why she should not go with all the rest of the neighbours to listen to the Reverend Mr. Craighead this Sunday morning ? No , it was impossible . She must even risk her soul . Perhaps she could confess when she got to Philadelphia , and be shriven . There would be a mass priest in the City , please God ! It had been a long time since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make the best of it , the very best . There was one great and consoling circumstance , nevertheless . As yet there was no chapel in Chambersburg . The service was to be held in Colonel Chambers 's new mill , and the roof was not yet over it . Only the open framework of the beams was there . Therefore , strictly speaking , it could not be said that she was going into a Protestantchapel . Thus , with apparent equanimity , and saying nothing of her inner doubts , Frances continued her own and Bridget 's outer preparations to attend the preaching at the mill , while moving about quietly and whispering in order to avoid waking Captain Jack . In fact , to get herself up properly , she had left Ruhannah early and returned to the wagon , where all her means for primping were more immediately at hand . And if her preparations of the morning before for Colonel Chambers 's breakfast had been startling and effectual , the final results of her Sunday morning toiletring were little short of triumphant . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the danger of being suspected of working after Saturday sundown , she and Ruhannah had locked the door of their bedroom the night before , and while the lodge met , they had revelled in the purchases of the day and contrived between them to cover the bare bones of two new bonnet frames with rich yellow paduasoy , and a small one for Bridget with black silk . These , with the addition of blue-black ties and hemstitched bows , were such pieces of worldly millinery as had seldom swum before the eyes of the Lord in any congregation in Chambers Mills , or for miles about  --  and Ruhannah knew it . Alas , there had been no time to make new bodices . But the bonnets !  --  they would burst on the gaze of the faithful unexpectedly as meteors . Frances must still wear her dress of the day before , but flier ( ' was a new grey silk shawl and a neckerchief to match , Loth with long fringes . And for Bridget , Melissa had borrowed a pair of small clout slippers . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had 4 u t the hot curling irons , and everything else , for doing her own and Bridget'shair . Bonnets required bangs curled in front , small ones , tight little ringlets . So Salathiel had most of Johnson 's kit in full blast that morning . And it was his best blue woollen suit , good stockings , and no leather stock but a tied cravat that he wore . Short of powdering his hair , he was now willing and even submissive " in going the whole hog " in the proceedings , as he nicely phrased it . One reason for this was that he had been told that the emigrants were looking for a ranger to guide them south and west over the mountains , and that someone had recommended him to them . They were offering one hundred minds down and all found , Yates had said so ; and said it so that St. ( lair could hear him . That was all right , but he , Salathiel , was not going to turn west again , not now ! Not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . That he had to admit did entice him . l ; lit since it was a temptation , he would rather not have to meet it . So the less he looked like Iris old self , the better for a day or two at least . The emigrants would he looking for a tall man in fringed buckskins , nursing a long rifle . I , yet them look , then . He would pass them by in a smooth blue coat and silver buckles on his shoes . He finished by fastening on an old pair that had once belonged to the captain , and giving his small-clogs a polish . He also displayed the captain'ssilver watch and chain across his best yellow serving waistcoat . But he was mighty glad Captain Jack slept like a babe all through this dressing-up business . So far he had n't even stirred . It was half past nine almost exactly when Colonel Chambers , Mr. Craighead , and Dr. and Mrs. Colhoun came down the mill path on their way to the mill and the morning 's preaching . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the bare upper branches of the willow trees . Colonel Chambers wore the regimentals of the Pennsylvania line but without his small sword . Mr. Craig/head 's wig was newly powdered . From the black bag in which he carried his Bible and other books , the ham had been advisedly removed . Dr. Colhoun approached his Maker in a modest grey surgeon'scoat with cherry-coloured pantaloons , a black three-cornered hat , and a little beaver muff that hung from his neck on an amber chain . In this he kept his empty purse , a full snuffbox , and both his hands on a cold day . It was turning a little cold this morning , he opined , and sermons were usually too long , especially in November in an open mill . He took a small pinch of snuff in anticipation , and said " Pshaw " loudly , as he found himself just balked of a wholesomesneeze . A small brass bell began ringing down at the mill . The colonel 's party approached more rapidly . The Albines were waiting for them . They stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Colonel Chambers was especially well pleased . He would appear at preaching today with a most genteel and acceptable company . As the chief personage of the neighbourhood , and the landlord of many in the congregation , he felt properly complemented ; his example respectably supported . It was an important occasion this morning . Mr. Craighead had come over from Old Church especially to preach the morning sermon . He was much beloved , and people always turned out in large numbers to hear him . And then there was a certain announcementthe minister was to make , one which concerned the colonel deeply and the congregation at Chambersburg , too , for all time to come . The three new bonnets were a little gladsome . But then this was no Quaker meeting , and they were nothing to what even the Seceders were wearing in the City . Folks would just have to get used to a little style with a man of substance like himself as presiding elder . Sooner or later he would have in instruments for the psalm singing , too . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an organ ! There was Scriptural warrant for it in the last psalm . He would ask Mr. Craighead to announce that particular psalm for the benefit of Patrick Vance , Esquire , an elder much opposed to instrumental music as a modern innovation . " Good morning , " said Mr. Craighead , cordially , touching his wig reminiscently and gratefully to Salathiel . His eyes twinkled as he looked over the women in their new shawls . " Some of us , I see , are making the fringes of our phylacteries long , " he chuckled , and then led the way along the mill-race at a faster pace . For the bell had ceased clamouring , and he prided himself on being on time  --  whenever Ahaz would permit . Under the fluctuating shadow and sunshine of a swiftly passing flock of clouds , the well-satisfied little company made its way towards the skeleton of the new mill , whose bare rafters could be seen rising gauntly above the dam . It would be a pity if it came on to rain , thought the doctor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might snow , if it kept getting much colder . Perhaps the raw weather would hold off until the afternoon ? If so , it would still be comparatively comfortable in the sheltered valley below the dam . Indeed , there was a hush in the atmosphere of the place when they arrived there . A larger congregation than even the colonel had anticipated was awaiting the minister . At the far end of the new mill the elders sat before a table reared on saw-horses on the raw plank floor . The open work of the rafters in the rough Gothic joinery of the gambrel seemed to sketch airily overhead only the bare reminder of a church roof . Beneath , the congregation sat on plank benches or were gathered in close about the new building , as close as they could press on either side and still see over the heads of the sitters from the rising ground about . The curious and continuous alternating of cloud-gloom and bright sunshine was startling and impressive ; now everything was bathed in glory , then all was overcast and plunged iii gloom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought Mr. Craighead , as he walked up the narrow aisle between the benches and depositedhis black bag on the big table . Ile took out leis heavy Bible , leather-bound hymnal and psalter and arranged them carefully and somewhat dramatically , as was his wont . I le theta put on a large pair of square spectacles . Colonel Chambers sat down amongst the elders , facing his family and visitors , who were now seated honourably on the front bench . He noted with pleasure that Mrs. Chambers was there , just come in on time from Shippensburg . But ready to lead the singing as usual . She never failed him . Ile would like to have smiled at her if he could . But being presiding elder was no smiling matter . Mr. Craighead turned , faced the congregation , and announced the opening psalm . They began in gloom , but a drench of sunshine suddenly poured down on them . And it seemed to the minister that it was not Madam Chambers , but the river itself with a certain hint of eternity in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old tune . Two hundred voices filled the valley with song " Praise ye the Lord . Praise God in his sanctuary : praise him in the firmanent of his power . . . " Back at the wagon , Captain Jack knew the 150th Psalm when he heard it . Indeed , he knew a great part of the Old Testament by heart , particularly the more sanguinary passages dealing with . yengeance. ip209upon the heathen . He was up now , crouching over the remains of Salathiel 's breakfast fire , and roasting a bit of sidemeat on a long fork . " Praise him with the sound of the trumpet : praise him with the psalteryand harp ... " The singing of the congregation rose deep and clear , high and eerie over the roar of the distant falls upstream . The meat was turning brown . Captain Jack hummed the next verse with the congregation : " Praise him with the timbrel and dance : praise him with stringed instruments and organs ... " He had n't meant to go to preaching this morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the past he had heard a good many sermons . But the taste of the music was almost as strong in his mouth now as the taste of the meat  --  and he felt the better for both . " Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord . Praise ye the Lord . " This time he joined in with all his old-time vim . His voice echoed heartily against the face of the old mansion . He looked up to see Yates and St. Clair grinning at him through the yard gate . " We wondered who was praising God all alone , " said Yates . " We 're bound for the preaching ourselves , but tardiness always likes company . Wo n't you come along , sir ? " " Wait till I finish my pork and taters , " answered Captain Jack , a bit testily . " An old man needs his morning sustenance , Sabbath or no . " They came over respectfully and sat down by the fire to wait while he ate . Presently St. Clair produced his silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's better , " said Captain Jack . " I do n't git immedjit effect from my victuals any more . " He raked a roasted potato from the ashes , broke it , and put salt on it . " What surprised ye to hear a man praising the Lord all alone ? " he asked out of the blue . " Well , now , " said St. Clair , " since you ask me . Praise by a congregationdoes sound more convincing . At least to me , " he added.  | " That 's ' cause you 're a politician , Arthur , " said Captain Jack . " You think everything must be done by committees . That 's the way ever since thar 's so many settlers in these once lonely and decent parts . But if the chief end of man is to glorify God exceedingly , one God and one man is all it takes . Ai n't it ? " asked Captain Jack , poising his potato . " Do you glorify him most by faith or by works ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quibble with ye , mister attorney , " said the old man . " No doubt you 're better at splitting hairs in a circle than I be . But kin ye tie a knot in them before ye lose both ends ? And let me ask you this : as a man of reason , what did ye ask me to go down to hear the sermon this mornin ' for ? " " For your company , " said Yates . Captain Jack dropped his potato , and grinned through his gums . " That 's mighty well put , young man , " said he . " Still I suspicion , as a lawyer you 're lookin ' for direct evidence . If so , testimony , indirect testimony is all you 'll ever git . " " Then I 'll be curious to hear what Brother Craighead may have to say this morning , " replied Yates . The old devil , he thought . Who would have guessed there was theology in him ! To take for granted what he still had to prove ! We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brushing the ashes off his buckskins . He wiped his mouth off , too . " We 'd better git gain ' , " he said . " That 's the invocation now . " They set off for the mill together . " Brother St. Clair will feel better where two or three are gathered together , " said Captain Jack , a little too casually as they walked along . St. Clair turned pale and purple under- his stock . " But shucks , " continued the old man , " it looks today like we 'd do even better than that . It 's no rump caucus down there . " There were , in fact , too many in the congregation that morning to hold the preaching in the mill . Everybody shifted to a hollow , in the meadow near-by , a place that had frequently been used for fieldpreaching , weather permitting , long prior to the erection of Colonel Chambers 's mill . And there was good reason for this arrangement . For not only was the ground in the field of a convenient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was only one other pulpit in Pennsylvania that resembled it. * It was the hollow shell of a huge poplar tree , which having once sustained a bolt from At Hill Town in Buckingham County.  |p211heaven  a half century before , now contributed its convenient remains to echoing forth the divine thunders of the itinerant clergy . Some rough-and-ready but ingenious axe work on its massive and heavily rooted lower trunk had cut into the solid wood a short semicircularflight of steps leading to a floor within the tree itself . That in turn supported a rustic lectern . Above this the shell of bark still projected in a prolonged hollow oval and was tied together at the top with old rope and stoppered with tar . A few thin planks extending forward and upward had been inserted towards the roof as a sounding board and hung there by a rusty chain . Crude as this rostrum accidentally furnished forth by nature might appear to the ecclesiastically sophisticated , it was nevertheless curiously impressive and acoustically effective . For in it the minister stood ten feet above the crowd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was more important , within perfect hearing of all his congregation gathered in the hollow of the field before him . Furthermore , the pulpit itself , being what it was , served to confine those who used it to its own deeply rooted and earthy style . Any affected discourse echoed from its natural depths would inevitably have sufferedthe tragic fate of inadvertent comedy . Yates , Captain Jack , and St. Clair arrived just when the congregationwas shifting from the mill to the meadow , and in time to take their places amidst the others without arousing comment . A few open wagons were drawn up towards the side , where some of the farmers ' wives and children sat overlooking the heads of the majority , who now seated themselves on the bare turf or on what fragments of logs , planks , and shingles they could secure . After a short pause for all to get settled , Mr. Craighead , his black bag under his arm , and followed by all the elders , approached the wide-spreading roots of the old tree , and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notched steps into the pulpit , while the congregation sang " Farewell ye blooming youth . . . " This , if not precisely appropriate , was stirring and popular as the new field-preaching hymn that ran to the same tune as the " Ballad of CaptainKidd . " It was therefore familiar to all . Almost too familiar in fact , for Bridget could not restrain herself and was heard on the last stanza prefacing the " Amen " with " Farewell to Lunnon Town The pretty girls all round ; No pardon can be found ... "  | until Frances put her hand over her little mouth , meanwhile trying to stifle her own giggles . However , this too passed unremarked , while the elders took their accustomed places in various convenient coigns of the roots below the minister , and solemnly awaited the end of the hymn and Mr. Craighead 's opening remarks . Had it not been that an air of wisdom and dignity , even a certain lugubrious solemnity , were the expected and habitual accompiaments of Presbyterian preaching , the droll appearance of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a pair of large horn-rimmed spectaclespeering from his bark pulpit would inevitably have reminded people of an owl discovered in a hollow tree by daylight , more often than it did . As it was , from long familiarity his neighbours took his appearance for granted and saved their comments for N% hat lie might have to say ; and this in full confidence that it would not be as solemn as he looked . For it was not Mr. Craighead 's habit when preaching to " Draw a wrong copy of the Christian face , Without the smile , the sweetness , and the grace . " Nor ( lid he , like so many of his contemporaries , preach by rote from manuscript with a flowing hourglass set before hint . George Whitefield was his better original . He spoke by inspiration , tined himself by the mood of his listeners , and chase his text at the last minute by skilful intuition . Quite often , indeed , he would open his big Bible haphazard and preach from the first text that happened to catch his eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided t ) ) follow that morning . He rolled his eyes upward to take a glance at the now-threatening clouds  --  and prayed silently that he might be permitted to preach without interruption from heaven . Then he opened his Bible about the middle and found his text : " Thy people shall be willing in the dayof thy power , in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning : thou hast the dew of thy youth .. . Psalm One Hundred Ten , the third verse , " said he , and paused impressively . Mr. Craighead spoke with a clerical accent that had been acceptablesome twenty years previously in certain Calvinistic circles in Aberdeen , where the Scots think that excellent English is spoken . His a 's were flat but his tones were rounded ; his general utterance wasp213both strong and clear . Nevertheless , it is not to be denied that on this particular Sabbath he hemmed a little , although without hawing ; and hesitated , as it were , a trifle in his usual forensic stride . For the truth was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had blundered upon by divine guidance , taken out of its context , had no grammatical meaningat all . Now this , as any kindly body who will stop to consider a moment can see , was a very serious predicament for Mr. Craighead . For , unless it rained , he was expected to detain , nay , to edify and inspire the minds and souls of his two hundred listeners for two mortal hours at least with an uplifting discourse on a sub ject without a theme . Not only that , but both his reputation and his 1 iving depended upon it . Quite hastily therefore , indeed with all the speed of thought , he rearranged mentally the resounding phrases of his text , hopeful that the holy obscurity would clear and a human meaning emerge . But nothing of the kind happened . If possible , the result was even more impenetrable . And it was this which had given the good man to pause . At the same time Mr. Yates looked up from the wagon wheel against which he was leaning , with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes before , he had answered Captain Jack 's question candidly , instead of preventing it by courtesy- , Yates would have had to admit that it was for such moments of intellectual crisis as this that he came to listen to sermons . Alone among those present he fully sympathized with and realized the ministe is predicament , and it was his keen curiosity to see how Mr. Craighead might extricate himself that now caused him to gaze towards the pulpit with an all but burningintensity . Nor was Mr. Yates 's curiosity only an idle one . Between the practice of his own profession and that of Mr. Craighead he drew many valuable analogies . Both , he thought , harked back in essence to custom and authority and were dependent for happy results upon persuasive oratory and the turning of awkward corners by neat rhetoricaltricks . Such was , of course , merely his professional and tactical view of law versus theology . For their common grand strategy and difficulties in proposing to restrain the evil in mankind , he had nothing but deepest sympathy . Hence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minister , was in difficulties , while at the same time he hoped to profit professionally by observing the method of his way out . That it would take considerable acumen he had small doubt . For the text had undoubtedly been recklessly chosen . It was a perfect fanfaradol of mystical saying ; in short , a frightful religious stunner . No wonder Mr. Craighead had paused . The question was , how in the world could he ever go on ? But go on he did.  |p214Like  so many other essentially logical-minded people , Mr. Yates had simply underrated the powers of religion and professional habit . Besides himself , there was no one in the congregation who was aware that morning of anything more than a seemly pause and a little throat trouble on the part of Mr. Craighead just before the sermon began  --  nothing that a glass of water could n't cure . The pastor looked at his flock owlishly and benignly , while they quite patiently and expectantly stared back . They waited in faith . Only Mr. Yates leaned forward anxiously . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dew of thy youth , " said Mr. Craighead , and continued . How fitting were the words of the Holy Writ this morning and in this place ! This was a new country . There was a risinggeneration in it , young , bright with the dew of a new day , the precious pearls of God 's grace . The question was , would they wear them in holiness or carelessly shake them off ? They were the sons and daughters of a God-fearing people , who , to escape tyranny over body and soul in the old country , had made of their lives a living sacrifice to the Lord in the New World ; and this in order to attain that freedomof the spirit which only Christians can have . Yes , the older generation had braved the mysterious and stormy Western Ocean , the loneliness of the forest , ravening beasts and the strange face of nature far from home . They had suffered the wild painted savages more cruel and subtle than the children of demons in hell . And theirs had been an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it and found it good . I ! is people had prevailed . The new land and all that was iii it was theirs . Thus it was a Promiscd land , the landI of brightest promise in all the world under the sun and stars . Only within the past few years , in the memory of even the youngest who now sat before him , the cruel heathen had been vanquished ; the idolatrous and naughty French uprootedand banished forever from the land . But that was not all . They were living in the days of the triumph of His people . How complete and mighty was the fulfilment of God 's word ! In all the world from one climate to another , and on the land and on the sea , the Lord had sent forth His bright angels of victory to light upon the standards of Great Britain and her Protestant kings . This was God 's bequeathment , the opportunity of all ages since ancient times , the inheritance of the new generation . And the greater part of that inheritance , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . America ! Here in a greater Britain , a nobler Scotland , a happier Ireland , a vaster and wilder Wales lay the vineyard unto which the new labourers were called . America was like the lost garden that all nations had always remembered . But it was not a dream of the past , it was the hope of the future , a garden setp215apart from the beginning for the re-enfranchisement of man . What would the new generation do with this their inheritance ; how should they finally come to possess it ? In this vein Mr. Craighead continued for over half an pour , until he came to the second part of his discourse : " Beth : In the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning "  - -  Thuswas the land to be possessed forever , and only thus ; by righteous living that well befitted an undefiled and virginal continent . For such was the new Eden to which the Lord had led them , a place of new beginnings saved apart , a secret garden kept in the sweet morning of God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world had gone old and stale and lapsed into twilight and darkness , a new day might burgeon and gloriously unfold . Where in all of remembered time , save for the incarnation of the Son himself , was there ever such a gift , such a proof of God 's providenceand love for the children of men , as His merciful withholding of the Western world from the carnal knowledge of Europe and the wicked ancients , until in the fullness of appointed time the seed of the gospel was ripe to be planted , and the womb of the morning ready to receive it ? Was not this , then , the prime prize , the great inheritance of the ages for all the Adams and Eves , who by grace had won their way back to it ? Woe unto them that abused the gift . For there was a covenant to be kept concerning it . It was plainly implied and explicitly stated in the words of the Psalmist . What was to be born of the union of the New World and the Old , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning , must be brought forth in the beauties of holiness . Here in this garden , as in Eden of old , by disregardingthe covenant with the Lord , those who had been permitted to dwell in it might bring about another fall of man , and be driven forth by angels with relentless swords . By doing evil they might lose their inheritance . Arrived at this lofty level of flight , Mr. Craighead maintained himself on the wings of eloquence for some time . High in the rare atmosphere of Christian virtue , he towered like a condor and looked clown with passing notice on the heaps of evil carrion with which , he said , it was plain to be seen the garden was already defiled and bestrewn . Gradually he lowered himself to take notice of the more notable spots of evil in the immediate neighbourhood and of the familiar failings of friends . These he dealt with forthrightly , and finally lit with an indignant flutter of wings upon the errors of the new generation . But it would not do to remain too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again upon a rising whirlwind of morning . Yates had picked up the lame horse he had left at Fort Loudon some months before . It was in fine fettle again . But Enna would now have to be taken care of , and there was Captain Jack 's sturdy brown gelding , which the old man would not be able to ride back to Carlisle , if it continued to storm . Despite his protests , it was only common sense he should ride in the wagon , rather than expose himself to driving sleet . Finally , a solution offered by St. Clair was found to be the best way out . Captain Jack 's mount and Enna were to be driven as a third team for the wagon , and Jed was to ride postilion on Enna as far as Carlisle . Adequate harness and a drag pole for the new arrangementwere put together that afternoon . " Wisht I was goin ' along , " said Arthur several times . Ile looked wistful . " Wait till the summer , " said Salathiel . " I wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , or how long we 'll be tarryin ' at Carlisle . You 'll be much better off here at Somerfield 's . " " I suppose so , " replied the lad doubtfully . Suddenly Salathiel burst out , " Arthur , I jist ca n't take care of ye now . Thar 's no use talkin ' about it . And you 've got another year to serve with Somerfield , who 's your good friend . Also , ye have no idea what it means to have so many mouths to feed . I 'd be skeered to take on any more now . What with Jed want in ' me to buy him from Mr. St. Clair , you wantin ' to conic along , and your young cousin Roy beggin ' me to buy his time out from Mrs. McKinney  --  why , thar 's no end to it ! And between you and me , maybe Captain Jack will take a little lookin ' after , too . " " Roy ! " said Arthur . " That youug'tni ! Why , he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youngster , and our Bridget is much taken with him . " " Thought ye was jes ' tal:iii ' her to her granny , " mumbled Arthur . " So I am , " snapped Salathiel , " but I ai n't found her grandma yet , all I know about her is in a letter . And if I do find her , maybe she 'll be sittin ' at the hearth , too . You ca n't tell . " But , there now , " he continued , seeing the boy was much chagrinedby his irritated tone , " I did n't mean to take my troubles out on you . It 's jes ' that I 've been gittin ' a little worried lately about how the family does recruit itself . Tell ye what ye do . You patch up that old family fight with your young cousin . Have him down to the store now and then . Teach him to read and cipher a bit . Try to help him . And when I do git settled in the City , you kin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to your uncle Ed . You youngsters ought to stick together like cousins agin the world . Allp219the Davisons be fine people ! Do n't forgit I 'm mighty partial to ' em . " They finished the work in silence , but Salathiel could see that Arthur was turning it over in his mind . Before dark all was in readiness . Only a trip to the smoke-house remained to complete the last item . But the longer it stayed there in the smoke and drying heat , the better . He and Arthur went over to the colonel 's and everybody was there for supper that night . Ruhannah was delighted to find that Arthur was so solicitous about his young cousin and insisted on helping out with him . As for Roy , he was noncommittal , surprised , and secretly pleased . Never mind what my pa said to Uncle Will , he thought . " Sometime soon I 'll ride downcountry and see ye , Bridget , " the boy said as they prepared to leave the cabin that night . " Ye 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to go ridin ' in that canoe , " he called after her down the hall . " Yes , " said Bridget , and fled . She and Frances and Captain Jack came over to sleep at the store that night to be on hand for the early start next morning . Yates and St. Clair would ride later , but promised to catch up with the wagon before Shippensburg . The good-byes were brief but heartfelt . " ' Pears like you 've been here a month or more , " said Colonel Chambers . " We 'll be seein ' you all again , I 'm sure . Here 's some muster rolls I want ye to take down to Colonel Burd at Lancaster , " he said to Salathiel . " And I 've writ him a line or two about ye , wo n't do ye no harm . " When they left the hospitable cabin that evening it was already starting to snow . There were eight degrees of frost on Colonel Chambers 's London thermometer and it was getting colder . Salathiel went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horses , and retrieved the hand . That night the wind blew with an ever-rising crescendo . In the morning , it was shrieking through the bare branches of Somerfield 's maples with the authentic howl of winter , and no doubt about it . Captain Jack was quite content , although he did not say so , to let them hitch his gelding in the lead team with Enna and ride himself in the wagon with Frances and Bridget . Mr. Somerfield and Arthur saw them off by the light of two lanthorns . The six horses , with Jed hunching forward into the storm on Enna , jingled and jangled through the darkness along the icy road to Carlisle.  |p220How  They Passed God 's People ByTHE RUMBLE of turning wheels , the steely clatter of twenty-four hoofs on the hard-frozen road , billowing clouds rolling westward  --  that morning the whole countryside seemed on the move as they pressed on eastward in the direction of Carlisle . Weather gave the overpowering impression . The entire landscape appeared to be torn loose and flowing . Stripped trees waved their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines of brown , curling leaves scuttled and swung sinuously before the storm , rising here and there into swirling fountains to be instantly snatched upward and away . The clay brightened slowly into universal silver gloom . Along the road from time to time , moving with an all but military front and precision , battalions of sleet and snow advanced swiftly down upon the wagon  --  and struck . The icy needles of sleet pattered and slithered along the canvas , while dry flakes swirled . The horses neighed and snorted under the recurrent punishment ; shook themselvesuntil their new slip bells clanged and sang . Then the flurry would go by and the road open up before them again . It was a grand nor'easter that was marching down . At least that was what Captain Jack called it as he sat comparativelywarm and snug within the wagon talking , and smiling reassuringlyat Frances and Bridget with her grey kitten purring in her lap . The sudden patter of ice and half-hail would drum on the tight canvas overhead  --  and pass . Outside the two drivers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaned forward into the storm and raised their heads again only when the assault ceased . Jed , with a battered three-cornered hat tied ludicrously over hisp 221fuzz by an old knitted scarf , which covered his ears and flapped behind him with ravelling ends loose in the breeze , sat hunched uncomfortably on Enna , a tattered blanket bound with twine swathed heavily about him . Still he was cold . Riding postilion for Marse Albine was not the fun he had anticipated . Snowflakes caught and lay melting on his upper eyelids . He looked forward despondently into the advancing storm , squeezing his eyes tight shut as the grim blasts swept down . The mare 's hard military saddle galled him . Between flurries he rode stolidly , half frozen , dreaming of the sun-stricken market square at Dahomey and its rustling palm trees . He gazed at the strange landscape ahead of him despairingly . Pennsylvania was beginning to moan and turn white under the lash of winter . What had become of his hot African town , of the camels lying in the shade of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool arcades , where little girls used to hide with small boys , smooth , naked , smelling of rancid butter ? Lawsy ! Under the wooden porch floors in Philadelphia it was hard scrabbling and dangerous going after curfew . Oh , Jedu-gawd , if only that fierce bearded Arab slaver had n't bought him from the chief  --  a twist of copper wire and a stinking old goat cheese for a thin little black boy . That was all he was worth . His sleek mammy had fetched a good deal more , he supposed . She might still be in Barbados . He hoped so . It was warmer there . Poor mammy ! Her new baby must have died . A half-frozen tear slid down his cheek  --  and then , the great bull whip was snapping about his head , cracking like pistol shots . He grabbed Enna by the mane and looked back fearfully . The big man on the wagon seat was laughing at him . Maybe he would buy him ? He was a good baas to work for . Marse St. Clair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Smack . It was the lazy horse with the yellow eyes that got it that time . They were moving fast now . No Dutch wagoner would ever drive like Marse Albine . He did n't seem to care if he killed a horse or two  --  or a man ! He was one reckless buckra . Jed started posting painfullyto ease himself as the teams tore forward down a long smooth declivity . Maybe the Albines would let him stay with them for a while at Carlisle , provided he could hold on long enough to get there . Gradually he managed to feel more cheerful , as the weather grew drier and speeding gleams of sunlight showed now and then hasteningacross the countryside . The snow flurries began to pass like clouds of light feathers as it got colder . But Jed 's difficulties were not so apparent from the driver 's seat ; on the contrary Salathiel was rattling along in high fettle and the best of good nature . He was more than content to be on the way east again so close to the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was almost there . No matter how St. Clair 's scheme for settling Ligonier worked out , it would mean only a temporary wait for him and Melissa at Carlisle . He was n't going to be balked of getting to the City now . At Carlisle he could lay plans for getting a toe-hold in Philadelphia . He might see Colonel Burd at Lancaster ; deliver that letter personally . Why , he could even talk to Buckey himself when he came through . The colonel  --  no , the brigadier !  --  would certainly remember him as " Ecuyer 's man " . Buckey had been so amiable to everybody at Fort Pitt . Now , why had n't he thought of that before ? Well , he would see ; wait for a while at Carlisle  --  pick up something in the meanwhile . He was well fixed to do that , if he could just get shelter somewhere . He 'd have to return the horses to Stottelmyer . But maybe that stout wagoner would not be back from Pittsburgh yet ; maybe he could still keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A hundred such alternatives and dim plans and hopes kept runningthrough his mind . The main thing , of course , was that with Frances being with child , he 'd just have to get her sheltered . They must settle-in before summer , but how ? Where ? And yet he was n't too worried about the immediate future . He had done well thus far ; laid in valuable stock and made friends at Chambersburg . And Frances Melissa was certainly one smart girl ; a clever helpmeet , if a man ever had one . Oh , they were going to get ahead . They were going to do well together . Most of his serious troubles lay behind him , he felt . By comparisonthe future seemed positively simple . He was escaping into it , he thought . He could n't help but feel fine about it . The future seemed so full of hope , of free movement , and of happy adventure . A little luck , a little more luck now , and . . . The whip cracked merrily . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How it did make the old wagon clatter along . They 'd be in Carlisle that very night . He would n't tarry for more than time-out for the noon meal at Shippensburg . In fact , as the day grew brighter and the wind keener , he felt more and more sanguine . He was warm in an old officer 's greatcoat with many capes . His beaver hat was tied down with a muffler over his ears . No one would recognize him now . Twin-Eyes for the first time was not beside him . She rode well greased in the sling on the ridge-pole in the wagon behind . Bridget was laughing and giggling in there again . But who would have thought that he should live top223hear Captain Jack sing ! Melissa certainly did have a way with her ! Yes , they were all going to be happy together for a while . It was a peculiar notion , he thought , but he saw the past lying behind him like a deep still pool in which only his own memories were clearly reflected . Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road . It was full of new sights and sounds , full of hope and movement . It flowed on smoothly into the time ahead . Five miles out of Chambersburg they passed the two empty Conestoga freighters going back to Lancaster from Somerfield 's . He fairly flashed by them , bells ringing , his three teams at a rumbling gallop . But getting on ! The sleepy drivers , who had left Chambersburgin the darkness hours before , scarcely had time to raise their whips in salutation and give a surprised yell before the big wagon went by , and they were looking at the little trundler flouncing and jouncing behind . Only when it seemed likely that Jed might be bounced clear off Enna 's back did he finally pull up again and walk the teams for a spell . A thick squall of snow came down the road , covered them , lifted  --  and they saw the long emigrant train on a crest afar off . Men , wagons , cattle , and horses in dark groups of toylike moving figures were crawling westward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reappearing through other snow-flurries ahead . He determined to push on straight through . He would not stop to hold a powwow with any of them . He would make them give way if necessary ! That was what he thought , until he saw they were strung out over a long mile of road , and still coming . He topped a gentle rise at a trot . In the swale below , in a bowl of meadows , lay a settlement , a few blind cabins stretching along the way . Two miles farther the advance guard of the emigrants , a small party of horsemen , were just beginning to come down the opposite slope . He pulled up for a moment to consider . The settlementlay between him and them . It would be just as well not to meet these people coming through the village . They would be most likely to pause there and want to talk . Then , either he or Captain Jack would be recognized , and they might try to strike a bargain about leading them westward , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a hurry . He turned to warn them in the wagon . " We 're goin ' to pass the Maryland Old Lights now , " he announced . " There 's a mighty congregation of them strung out along the road ahead . I do n't aim to confabulate . I 'm goin ' by fast . " " Jist as well , " replied Captain Jack dryly . " Reverend Alexander Alexander , their leader , is a powerful detainer and persuader. "  | " Alexander Alexander , the riverend ! " exclaimed Frances Melissa . " Him ! " She peeped out across the seat at the column of riders , carts , and pack horses now pouring down the crest ahead . " I told you so ! A big man with a beard , mounted on a piebald stallion . A long gun and the English Book in a black bag at his saddle-bow . He 'll be ridin ' like black Fate to an unholy weddin ' . Did n't I tell ye we 'd meet up with him and his murderin ' Sassenachs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I told ye so , " she kept saying . " I told ye so . " He thought little of it . Everybody had been talking about the emigrant congregations . " I told ye so ... " " So ye did , so ye did , " he finally had to acknowledge . " I did n't think they 'd be on the move so soon , and winter comin ' on . Well , here they be , and we goin ' t' other way ! " He held her hand and talked cheeringly . He knew that for some deep reason she hated and feared these emigrant Presbyterians . " Now sit ye down and hold fast . Do n't worry . I 'm goin ' right through . Just keep your head in . I want no wayside gossip . " She withdrew into the wagon willingly . " Jed ! " he shouted , " hold on ! Do n't let them step ye . Lead around if ye have to . Go ' round ! " lie motioned what he meant vigorously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He understood . But he was n't sure that Salatheil couid see what he saw . Just ahead the slope fell away suddenly and awfully into a hidden creek bottom . Oh , Lawdy , Lawdy !  --  they were off . The ears of the lead horses disappeared clown a steep banklike declivity . The wagon followed with ; i sickening swoop . The rounds of its rear wheels fitted snugly like coins rolling in a hoop into the curving fall of the road . They ground and crunched on the pebbly stuff of the stream-bank , while the trundler striking a boulder leaped into the air , its wheels spinning . Bridget left her little stomach hanging in air . Frances Melissa clutched her sides . Down , down , down .. . Jed wailed .. . Down .. . The teams were going like mad . They were running away from the wagon now , terrified . It threatened to overtake them . They laid their ears back and galloped , streaming ahead . It was the breathless moment of the journey . Everyone from Jed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy wagon and the clutch of panic made palpable by gravity. p 225They crashed through thin new ice in the shallow ford at the bottom of the hidden glen , a wicked rut that nearly wrecked them . And then luckily  --  luckily for them  --  since the teams were now making a frantic bolt for it , the road swung away gently , almost level , and straight before them . It led across flat meadows and on through the settlement . Down the gentle slope on the far side of the village , the emigrantswere beginning to pour in a steady trickle of men and vehicles . They flowed down the road as though a dam had suddenly broken somewhere behind them and its long pent-up flood was now released . For some distance Salathiel lost control of his beasts entirely . He was angry with himself . It was his own fault , he felt sure . He had let himself go wool-gathering in a fine daydream of the future while the present had slipped his hand . Minding God 's business was a dangerous thing . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses have their silly heads and gallop it out . Sooner or later the cumbersome weight of the ark behind them must begin to tell , and it was uphill not far ahead . Nevertheless , it was a mad quarter of a mile to the village ; more like the wild finish of a chariot race than the decent progress of a respectable wagon with a domestic load . The iron rims sang , the hoofbeats gathered themselves into a regular frantic rhythm . Flecks of foam worked loose from the ends of the horses ' bits and spatteredback against his coat . They drove down on the village like a small cloud on the forefrontof a gale . They fairly thundered through . Astonishment seemed to close in behind them . Half the houses were still empty . Only a few belated people ran out of doors to see . Even the dogs were too late . All but one hound . Driven into a frenzy by the thundering of wheels , it gathered itself , even as it coursed them , for a jump at the lead horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sprang . It rolled over and over , yelling . The wheels rumbled on . Captain Jack permitted himself a generous cut of shag to comfort his vacant gums . Jed opened his eyes and began to ride upright again . He was still in Pennsylvania ! They struck the beginning of the rise beyond the village . The whip cracked . Marse Albine was driving again . " Golly , golly ! " mutteredJed . He was going to take it out on the teams now and gallop them uphill too ! The reins tightened and slapped viciously . Jed and the horses settled down to business . Salathiel swore . Frances Melissa had just said something pretty hot to him under the canvas . A fierce word or two about murdering them all . That , under the circumstances , was annoying . As if it had n't been exasperatingenough that he 'd let the horses run clean away . That damned haw-haw in the road had certainly jarred his equanimity badly . But that was n't all . He felt an increasing sense of tension , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emigrants . It was quite unreasonable and mysterious . He even told himself he was being superstitious . None the less , his feeling of guilt kept growing . It was thisHe could not shake off an unreasonable impression that somehow or other he was going the wrong way . Swift as the pace had been for the last quarter of a mile or so , and absorbing as the business of restraining the horses was , he had none the less been thinking . And he felt the doubt of the direction in which he was going overtaking him as though it were something physical catching up with him from behind . Perhaps it was because the hidden dip in the road had suddenly and so violently disconcertedhis dreamful anticipations ; or perhaps it was Melissa 's wild talk and his knowledge of her terror of these Scotch-Irish that he now shared ? When you lived with a woman you came to sympathize even with her mysterious hatreds , to share her antipathies against your own will . You could n't help it , if you loved her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , it was all so surprising , so unexpected , as he whirled along over the next furlong of road . All his life , ever since he had talked with McArdle as a boy , he had been scheming and struggling ; hungry to get back to the settlements , to find himself and what belonged to him in the Dawn Country . And now ? Now , by God , he felt an all but overpowering impulse to turn around and drive back to the mountains again . .. . That wonderful summer , hunting homeward through the secret green-gladed forest back to ' led ford ; that paradise of careless ease and plenty beyond the Conemaugh , lonely freedom  --  would it ever be like that again ? Something caught in his throat . I le cursed ... . Why , he must be going crazy , thinking of turning back to live like an Injun again ! Hell 's jangling bells ! Who would have supposed he was not sure enough of himself to talk to a passel of Macs bound westward ? He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd drive right on through ! That was why the whip cracked again . That was why he seemed to be swearing at the horses instead of at himself , and why Jed felt a blast of hot fury pass close by over the back of his neck as the reins slapped angrily . Marse Albine was sure damn mad at somebody . Jed hoped he was n't mad at him . He leaned forward to take the coming rise at ap 227gallop and guide Enna through the oncoming horsemen just ahead . Evidently Marse Albine was n't even going to slow up . But those people ahead looked pretty grim and he hoped they would draw aside . He remembered he was only . . . only worth an old goat cheese . At that moment a blast of driving snow topped the rise ahead and swept down the road towards the wagon . Jed could just see through it , and that there were other flurries following behind , trailing long curtains of frozen misty weather . Patches of yellow sunshine like small round eyes began to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clouds above were examining this people curiously . For an instant the long caravan was spotted like a writhingsnake . Then the advancing flurry passed them and closed down over the wagon . Salathiel drove recklessly straight through it . When Jed opened his eyes again the lead team was galloping down on a party of horsemen , some in the road and some scattered out in a vague line advancing through the fields on either side , carryingrifles . They were the van of the caravan , young men , the chosen of both congregations , well dressed and determined looking . Gentlemen , gentlemen , gentlemen , pounded the hoofs of the six horses . Salathiel grinned , crouching low , and hurling the whip only once . It cracked like a breaking beam and the wagon and its hard-breathing horses burst out of the flurry ahead of the riders like an apparition , rumbling and coming uphill at them furiously . The young men in the road hesitated for a moment , and then rode aside hastily . They had never seen anything quite like this heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something royal and massive  --  yet swift . They shouted a warning after it as it plunged on up the slope . There was a child mildly looking out behind . Another billowing curtain of cloud came sliding down the hill . It passed .. . Just ahead now Salathiel could see a company of sturdy horsemen , six or eight of them . From their mounts and their clothes , there could be no doubt but that here were the leaders o f the congregations . Good horses , long blue cloaks , Bible bags , and a couple of ministers among them with wide felt hats . The elders and clergy of the following host rode as the leaders of God 's people should ride as they passed westward towards the Promised Land : sedately , grimly , determinedly . They shook the snow-flakes from their capes gravely . In the unearthly racing winter weather of alternating and mysterious gleams and glooms , fingers of sunlight burst through from overhead and played wantonly with the rolling cloud of mist and whirling snow-flakes passing down thep228road just before them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dim white flames and silver smoke , on fire inside . The leader of the host pointed proudly at the phenomenon , and smiled . There was no one in the group behind him who was not solemnly aware of the apt Biblical reference in his gesture . Out of the pillar of cloud the wagon burst suddenly upon them . It was going like hell . The Reverend Alexander Alexander held up his gauntleted hand . This strange , rocketing vehicle must stop . It was coming out of the west and he would have speech with its driver about the state of the roads ahead . He now held his hand up higher , spreading his leather-clothed fingers out like a yellow star on the end of his arm . Neither he nor his elders ceased to advance along the highway or meant to pull aside . He had held up his hand . Like Moses , he was used to being obeyed . In the amalgamated double congregations marching behind him were three hundred and thirty-odd souls . Auld Lichts , sons and daughters of Calvin and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dour personage of the Reverend James McTain , an Aaron rode just behind him . A faithful man , a tried servant of the Lord God of Sabaoth . The Reverend Alexander Alexander stretched forth his hand . " Go ' round , Jed , " roared Salathicl , and gestured , standing up to handle the whip and reins . The Reverend Mr. Alexander and the Reverend James McTain both thought he was going to pull up . The hand sank back to its ponunel . Frances Melissa could not resist peeping out under the canvas . What was it they were going to drive around ? There he was ! She saw him now directly ahead . Just as she had seen him before . The terrible man ! His beard flowed down over his breast , spotted with snow-flakes . Under his wide-brimmed hat , which flapped back flat against his forehead , his eyes blazed a cold and horrid blue . He was tall , straight , dour . A grim Jove of a man on horseback . No smile could bend the iron level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Its knee action seemed to devour the road ; to push the very landscape aside . Oh God , thus and thus had Cromwell rid . Mother of God , have marcy upon us ! She began to mutter and to pray . She saw a look of swift surpriseturn into a blaze of red anger on the minister 's face . She was that near . But the wagon was not going to stop . She sank back against the side boards , one hand at her pounding heart , white-faced. p 229 " Jedu , " muttered Jed into Enna 's ear . " Jedu come an ' ride wid me on this hyah hawse . " Jed no longer remembered the secret African name of his native duppy . A kind Quaker in Philadelphia had taught him to read a little and to say his prayers . There was the Great Snake , of course ; but far away , long ago . Not in these cold woods . Jedu would help . " We 's gwine ' round , " Jed informed his new white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And with that he pulled Enna 's head violently to the right and guided the column of galloping horses and the wagon after them off the road and out into the open meadows at the side . It was a shallow ditch  --  thank God ! They described a wide half-circle about the horsemen in blue mantles , and then , with only a minor jar , were back on the road again still going , still going like hell uphill . Someone in the wagon had screamed . Marse Albine was laughing . The Reverend Alexander and all his elders stopped . They had watched the wide avoiding sweep of the wagon as it hurtled past them , with astonishment . They were not used to being treated so cavalierly . The chief minister was indignant . He turned around to get a good look at the affair . Who was it that had been standing up , driving like Jehu ? Up the road the caisson seemed to wag its tail at him , and he saw there , still visible on the box , the fading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then . But he gave an indignant snort as he turned westward again and sternly resumed his way towards the wilderness . For as long as he could remember , he and his fathers had been at either physical or spiritual odds with the royal authority . James or George , it was all the same ; Penn or Calvert . In the Promised Land , somewhere in the rolling mists ahead , he and his people should soon be free of all earthly authority whatsoever . They would go beyond such malignanciesand live according to Holy Scripture . " You may be king , Alec , you will be king , " whispered an unseen voice . " Get thee behind me , " muttered the minister , and began to pray that he should not be led into temptation . The devil might follow , but it was a long , long way . And he would wrestle with him ; wrestle in prayer , even as Jacob , on the headwaters of the Cherokee River . Captain Jack had observed the passing events of the last few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As he saw it , these people were fleeing westward . Their rifles were badly needed in Pennsylvania . They were piously deserting their country . As the wagon swung back on the road violently , he comfortedBridget , who had given a startled scream . Frances , he saw ,  |p230was  sitting in the forward corner , the colour of new wool and looking drawn . " Now , now , " said Captain Jack , " there 's nothin ' about the ReverendAlexander and his moss troopers to be so skeered of . Besides , they 're takin ' themselves clean out of this province . They 've bin called by the voice of God into the nether parts of Virginny , or so Mr. Alexander avers . Maybe it was another noise , maybe it was jilt the voice of the governor of Virginny they heard . I see by his last proclamation the governor 's kind o ' assumin ' the Almighty . We , the Governor '  --  wonder what it is makes a man feel so durned plural as all that ? Might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say , but mawt be . " He rose and ejected a long fan of yellow tobacco juice out of the rear of the wagon in the direction of the fading horsemen . When he turned again Frances was smiling . His old eyes slyly twinkled at her . He and she enjoyed a little turn of wit together . She was a good gal , he thought , a mighty fine piece out of old Ireland . But it would n't do for him to linger too long with these young folks . They made him remember what he had to forget  --  or die of the memory . " Thar 's nothin ' but wagons and cattle ahead , " lie remarked casually , poking his head out , " but we 'll git to Shippenshurg shortly . And  --  1 think 1 ' 11 lie quilt in ye there . I 've bin thinkin ' it over , " said he . Frances began to try to persuade him not to leave them , not realizing that it was she and Hie child that had started him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden longing on him to be alone in his cabin by his own hearth , where there was no one at home but himself and the fire . He would not answer her protests , but kept talking about the wagons they still had to pass . " ' They 're cumin ' on , " he said , " and we ai n't goin ' so fast now . " he was right about that , and she came to look out behind . Dragging the big wagon uphill had finally taken the tucker out of the horses , and they had been glad to fall back into a trot at the first restraining pull on the reins . In fact , they would have walked if Salathiel had let them . The rest of the caravan proved to be about a half mile behind the leaders . The reason for this was soon apparent ; a great many of the wagons and carts were being pulled along by oxen . However , the first group of vehicles they passed must have belonged to the more prosperous among the Marylanders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newly purchased for the remove westward , and still gay with fresh paint , new leather buckets , and white canvas . These wagons were all drawn by horses . But thep 231nags were of all kinds and descriptions ; farm and draught animals of somewhat plaintive dispositions , to judge by their pace . Here and there , mounted on more mettlesome and respectable chargers , the fathers of families rode beside their wagons , many of which were being driven along by women or young boys . Yet the string of ten new Pennsylvania wagons indubitably did present a prosperous and impressive appearance . They might at a little distance have been taken for a regular convoy of freighters had it not been for the piles of furniture  --  chairs , beds , chests , and spinningwheels loaded behind at all angles and in an unconvincing way  --  or for the crates of drooping half-frozen fowls , lean dogs running underneath , and an occasional favourite milch cow or promising young colt hitched behind and towed along , always , it seemed , with a taut rope kept at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and childish voices singing softly penetrated through the canvas to Frances and Bridget as they pulled past . Children and drawn-faced women , their heads in shawls , peered out through chair rungs , swinging lanthorns , and domestic sundries from the oval canvas opening over the tailboards . They waved to Bridget and Captain Jack , or called some message after them ; something which could not be heard over the grinding of wheels and the shrill squealing of axles . Squeals , indeed , were the last thing they heard from the Conestogas , and such eminent and heart-rending squeals . The final wagon towed behind it , on a pair of old cart wheels , nothing less than a heavily barred pigpen bolted to a wooden floor . Confined in this dripping coop , a dilapidated sow and her numerous young family lamented in a lively chorus of squeals and contrapuntalgrunts their involuntary transit to the western wilds . Punctuated by the violent bumps of their mysteriously moving penitentiary , the pigs ' Miserere at times achieved a shrill fife-like harmony of terror that blent with the piping of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees . Then it would die down into a wheezing undertone of tired umbilical melaucholy , but never while on the move did it entirely cease . As the two wagons passed each other , three red-headed little girls looked out of the oval canvas-frame of their house-on-wheels , waving violently to Bridget . They jumped up and down , joining her in a gale of high silver laughter in mutual appreciation of how humanly funny is the audible sorrow of pigs . Captain Jack also was drawn into this humorous understanding and came to the rear of the wagon to look out . Just as they passed , the tragedy of pigdom found its perfect voice . Moved perhaps by the sight of the east-bound wagon returningp232towards her old Maryland home , the huge tit-draped black and white sow thrust her conical clownlike countenance halfway between the stakes of her prison , and while her pink muzzle smoked in the frosty air , she achieved for a lyrical interval complete prima donna status as the Calliope of Hogdom . Nor was her expression of sorrow rendered any the less poignant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supreme tragedy , her family fell upon her from behind to seek nourishment . The noise of her maternal indignation carried far . If there were any bears hibernating in hollow trees in the neighbourhood , they must have turned over in their dreams , while their mouths watered . At any rate , Captain Jack had not laughed so heartily for twenty years . " I do aver , " said he , wiping the beads of humour from his eyes , " the old gal has more sense than most of the leaders in yon fawncy caravan . She 's the most eloquent prophetess of the hul company . It 's predestination she 's complainin ' about , and she 's a firm believer . She knows she 's got her feet on the downward path and is headed the wrong way . " " What 's that ? " inquired Salathiel , sticking his head back into the wagon  --  " what 's that about their bein ' headed the wrong way ? " Frances and Captain Jack laughed at his serious and anxious expression . " Nothin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . I was jist commentin ' on the wisdom of ntixin ' a little hog sense with religion . " He grinned . " Dist keep on drivin ' , Sal . You 're ( loin ' all right . Jist stick to your last . " From this , since he had not been iii on the beginning of the conversation , Albine derived considerable unexpected comfort . Maybe he was going the right way a her all . The emigrants were certainly headed for a forest of troubles , and he noticed that not many , even of the outriders , were carrying rifle-guns . What kind of people did they think they were going to meet ? Quakers ? The shrill lament of the emigrant pigs died away sadly into the distance . A thick gust of winter concealed the white tops of the Conestogas in a pall of snow . Bridget stopped waving . Salathiel drove on . Half a mile ahead he struck the main body of the people of Israel advancing towards the Promised Land . Nevertheless , they were still in wagons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foot pace . Most of them were pulled by oxen , the first in yoke-span Salathiel had ever seen . There were some old army wagons evidently recently purchased from the militaryauthorities at Carlisle , for the king 's mark was still on them . Beside them , armed with tall goads and switches of stout hickory saplings , the fathers of families plodded along patiently in cowhidep 233boots , their frosty breaths and those of the oxen intermingling . There were innumerable old farm vehicles too ; frail , heavy , fourwheeled , and otherwise , laden like Noah 's arks , piled up and obviouslyoverwhelmed with everything that would ride and not disintegrate . For the most part these sorry carts were covered with old sails or linen mangoes held in place by an agony of amateur knots and tackle , with crazy quilts as often as not stuffed into cracks and rents . Here , in dismal corners and hollow places amid their sorry chattels , women and children , old people and babies faced westward , freezing but patient ; comforted by what small helps their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their hope of Beulah land and their firm faith and prejudices ; cheered along by prayers , songs , hymns , a fife or a solemn flute . But above all , they relied on everlasting gossip and the constant din of their own progress . That indeed was considerable , both human and otherwise . Yet there was a certain soothing and eternal tone about it , too . Ducks quacked , geese honked , and children chattered ; cows bawled and the oxen from time to time lowed softly . A few cherished pigeons in small cages occasionally cooed . Only the wheels and the surging and creaking furniture , only the grating of iron implements and the chains of the harness jangled or complained . All that was living , except the doomed pigs , passed westward with a kind of invincible and visible assurance that hope lay in the direction in which they were bound . It was as if the sun itself , hidden by clouds though it was that morning , was drawing them after it by some magnetic influence rained down from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had made Salathiel so uncomfortable . He seemed to be pulling against it . He felt the tension as he passed . What , thought he , suddenly moved to a bit of classic reminiscence  --  " What ! will the line stretch out to the crack of doom ? " It seemed so . Out of the weather still darkling behind them , an interminable line of vehicles continued to come . It was not often , he reflected , that he would meet a whole colony on the road . He wove carefully in and out among them now , passing them on either side of the road , how and where and as best he could . Or at a walk perforce , or with his tired teams steaming , he waited for them at times to pull aside , which they did contentedly , meanwhileexchanging many a cheerful greeting and kindly salutation with him as they passed . They were a kindly folk , hearty , but too decent ever to betray their curiosity . There was never a loud laugh or a curse . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rang in his ears . Frances was calling and nodding now to the eager women from behind . She had takenp234off her bonnet . So it was not at it that they smiled , but at a sister 's fair face , and with womanly sympathy . Now , at last , they were down to the two-wheeled carts , and the strange and ramshackle contraptions on wheels of all kinds that brought up the rear . Ancient scarecrow steeds and sway-backed dobbins imparted what motive impulse they still had to spare to that which followed them behind . Bony hips and knotted and twisted tails stalked slowly forward . There was even a dilapidated post-chaise , some social derelictof time , drawn by a team of an old mare roped in with a cow . A young boy drove this proudly , his sister , her face swollen with toothache , sitting beside him . " Now , sis , " he kept saying , " now , sis , we 'll soon git to Colonel Chambers ' . " Behind him were several familieswhose draught cattle had perished or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some who dragged a light cart after them by hand , desperately but as confidently as they could . Only they had nothing to say as the wagon passed , and were too tired or preoccupied to gaze after it . This must be the end , thought Salathiel . This is all that anybody can do with wheels . And in that he was right . But he was not quite to the end yet . A quarter of a mile farther on he passed the bell . It was not a big bell , but it was bronze and it was heavy . It was slung from a log tripod on a stone boat dragged by two white oxen . The clapper was roped and muffled . Mill , at certain angles , it had a slight play . Now and then when the sledge struck a rock or a deep hole in the road , the clapper swung and the hell hummed , whether reminiscently or expectantly it would be hard to tell . Its strange melodic murmurs reverberated and died away through the astonished woodlands . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a younger brother , an urchin with a bow and arrow in his hands , rode upon the sledge with the bell . Out of sheer curiosity Salathiel pulled up the teams to see so strange an object going past . " Londinium MDCCXI " ran the inscriptionaround the rim of the bell . There was something cast on the other side that he could not see . " It 's from our old chapel at Munster , sir , " replied the tallest boy in response to Salathiel 's inquiry . " We 're takin ' it along with us to hang in father 's new church at the south . " " It calls the people to say their prayers , " piped up the urchin on the sledge , and made a steeple with his hands to illustrate . His fingers looked blue with cold . " Here 's a pair of old mittens for ye , son , " said Salathiel , much moved by the child 's earnest little face . " Liken they might fit . " Hep 235reached under the seat-box and pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossed them to the little boy . They " fitted " halfwayup his arms . " Judas priest ! " shrilled the child . " Bind your blasphemous tongue , Donald , and thank your benefactor , " growled his brother . " Thankee , sir , oh , thankee kindly , " cried the little boy , wiggling his new paws violently . Even the older brother laughed . Salathiel waved his whip and drove on . " Mind the cattle , " screamed the youngster . " There 's bad hulls among ' em . " Another wave of the lash and its sharp report over the backs of the horses replied . Weavingthrough the caravan had consumed considerable time . Bridget crawled out on the seat beside him now and put a small arm over his shoulder consolingly . " I 'm comin ' to sit beside ye , " she said encouragingly . " Did ye hear what that little boy said ? Well , ye do n't need to heed him . There 's always more cows in a herd than bulls . And I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the brown rabbit one . " " Liken we can git along , then , " said Salathiel gravely . Nevertheless , they came across the herd unexpectedly . It was in the middle of a patch of half-open woodland , when suddenly there was a dismal bellowing and the sound of cow horns being blown ahead and on all sides , with a constant barking of dogs . Stray cattle began to pass them , running ahead of the drove through the trees . Here and there an outrider could be glimpsed heading them in , with a dog dashing back and forth frantically . A heavy fall of sleet suddenly dimmed the scene before them , coursing in long white lines past the black boles of the trees . The wind moaned and seemed to answer the braying of horns . In the midst of this , and in a cloud of flying snow , they met the main herd , which appeared to be stampeding away from the storm . A mass of black cattle loomed up on the road on the run , moving solidly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The moving mass flowed around the white wagon as if it were an island in a stream . For a moment or two they looked down on a forest of passinghorns , lines of black backs streaming past , the inflamed whites of startled eyeballs rolling up at them . They were little cows , a few motleys and some dun-coloured , but black mostly , dead black . They drove past muttering in a constant dismal lowing with here and there the deep bellow of a bull . The horses stood and sweated while Jed looked into the faces of a legion of black-horned devils . Their horns passed terrifyingly near his shanks . He drew his legs up gingerly and sat his saddle squatting like a Turk . Then there was a tempest of bleating and begging baas ,  | and for a minute the wagon seemed to be inundated by a flock of sheep . Five or six busy dogs , and as many horsemen , sounding what amounted to a kind of fierce fugue on cow horns , brought up the rear . They moved onward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unspeakably grateful , as the wagon still stood waiting , resumed . " I guess most of what them settlers own is cattle , property that can move on its own legs , " mused Bridget . " Reckon that 's about right , milady , " agreed Salathiel , unable to keep an entirely straight face at so unexpected and practical a comment from one so small . It was not an observation which he would have thought of making himself . " But I like sheep best , " continued Bridget . " I like ' em when they 're little e-we lambs . " " Giddap , " barked Salathiel. ... lambs , eh ? He remembered the wolves hunting the elk only a few days back beyond the ridges . I wonder how they 'll fare , he thought . He stood up and looked behind him over the roof of the wagon . They were out in the open now . The last flurry of thick weather rolled down the road behind him . The wind came keening and clear , piping out of the northeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches rose from the edge of the road down which the herd had just disappeared . It slanted forward in a cloud westward , seeming to he following them . Now and then a distant barking , a solemn bellowing , or an eerie note on a horn broke through . " Then the soul UI of the wind swallowed all . The cloud rose higher , the sun looked through . God 's people had passed . He sat down and handled the reins again hopefully . Now that they were past , he was glad to be driving cast again . He put his arm about Bridget and drew her closer to hint . Jed looked back and took courage from his smile . A mile or so over the distant fields and scattered woodlands , the wood smoke from the chimneys of Shippensburg made a blue hazy patch in the winter air.  |p237Swan  Song on a HarpsichordOUT OF THE DARK weather retreating into the distance behind them , St. Clair and Yates came posting down the road and overtook the wagon just as it was entering Shippensburg . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yates flashed past without drawing rein . Evidently the two riders were making a race for it ; both fine greys paced each other neck and neck down the long muddy vista of the single street of the town . As far as Salathiel could see , they turned in at the same place precisely together . He watched them dismount and tie their horses to the hitching bar before a stone building , where a cumbersome canvas-covered wagon , its teams lacking , was standing forlorn in the road . Leaning over a fire that had been kindled directly beside it , a man in a black cap was very busy about something . Except for him , there was no one in sight . A light , patchy snow covered the village , and had it not been for the smoke rolling from numerous chimneys , it would have seemed desolate . Certainly it was unkempt . But there was good reason for that , Salathiel reflected . Most of the inhabitants must have fled to Carlisle during last year 's troubles ; probably the majority had only recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ log slabs . Still , it was the largest town he had ever been in , also the longest . It stretched out for a mile or two ahead on either side of the highway in a loose congeries of buildings , mostly log cabins , but with gardens , barns , and an occasional stone or brick house of pleasant proportions . Decidedly it was a town and not a settlement . It had been there for a long time , he supposed . Indeed , his nose , if not his eyes , assured him of that . Even in winter there hung about it something of the stale reek of Fort Pitt during the siege . Too many people have lived too close together here for too long , his nose said  --  white people and horses ; a stale odour mixed with wood smoke , faintly rancid and sweetly sour , when the fresh wind stopped blowing in from the fields . He sniffed it and remembered . Possibly so keen a nose-sense was going to be a considerablecross to bear . As for letting people know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ! But he did , he could  --  he laughed . There was a certain advantage to it , too . When that thief had stood so close to the wagon the other night , for instance . They were passing a rocky mound on the left of the street now , with the remains of a considerable stockade on it . Old Fort Franklin perhaps ? He 'd heard of it . But it had been abandoned not long after Braddock 's time . Where , then , was Fort Morris ? That must be Mr. Ed Shippen 's mansion they were passing now ! The finest house he had ever seen : red brick , tall windows and a fanlight doorway , glass , glass everywhere . He whistled and pointed it out to Bridget . " Shippen 's , " he said . She took it quite calmly . " Marse St. Clair say pull in here , " shouted Jed . He pointed to a low stone building with a parapet , and embrasures in the walls instead of windows , on the same side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yates 's mounts were hitched before it . He now saw that the wagon standing in the street had only two wheels . The rear wheels were off and it was propped up . A lot of household stuff had lately been spewed out behind . Sonic smashed furniture and pieces of china still littered the road . Feathers had cone out of a pillow and were still blowing about . The man in the black fur cap -- and leather apron  --  was putting on a new axle . I he had some thin iron rods heating in the coal fire near-by to bore rivet holes in the wood . " They 're watchin ' fer ye in Char , " said lie , looking up from the ground where he was lying underneath the wagon , and pointing with his hammer . " Tell ' cm I 'm nigh finished , will ee ? " Salathiel allowed he would . I t was only as he was hitching the teams to the long log rail that he realized he was about to enter Fort Morris . The curious blind-walled stone building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " We 're here ! " he shouted . Captain Jack and Melissa came clown the rear ladder stiffly . The old man was carrying his hand-pack . " Hope Rutherford has a right hearty blaze goin ' , " he remarked . " It really does be turnin ' cold . " " What 's the pack for ? " asked Salathiel . " I 've got somethin ' valuable in it I would n't trust ye with , " grinned Captain Jack . " Let 's go inside . " Bridget was already fumbling in vain with the massive wroughtironhandle of the fort door.  | " That 's a tough one for young customers , " said the old man . " Better let your pappy snag on . " Salathiel leaned heavily on the lock before it gave . The left leaf of the heavy loopholed oak door swung inward , and they felt the welcome indoor warmth and smelled new whitewash . There was more warmth than light inside , however , and for a moment they stood in comparative darkness , trying to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Fort Morris was unique , almost cavelike . The floor , the groined ceiling , and its walls were all alike of dressed stone . Inside there was a single huge barrack room , with one tremendous open chimney for the garrison 's cooking at its far end . Several ample stone platforms about three feet high rose at regular intervals along both walls , upon which small marine cannon had once been mounted . What windows the place had were deep embrasures let high in the walls like the ports of a ship . lint these openings were now in process of either being carefully boarded over or smoothly bricked up . The ceiling was comparatively low , but it was composed of a series of domes like those in a German wine cellar , and the first impression of the place was that of the flickering flow of shadows and lambent firelight which perpetually washed these inverted stone cups overhead and flowed downward , streaming away in grey waveringlines of luminous shadows along the whitewashed walls . So confusing was this dim home of shadows , after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could make out into what strange place they had come . Then , as their pupils widened , they sawThe fire , the warm leaping heart of the room ; a grey-haired woman in linsey-woolsey standing before it turning two fowls on a spit ; another woman standing beside her helping , in a shimmering blue silk dress ; the pointed ears and backs of two tabby cats solemnly watching the cooking . On one side , on the stone platform nearest the fire , sat St. Clair and Yates , a bowl of hot punch already steaming on the table before them . On another platform , immediately opposite , three tow-headed children leaned across a table staring fixedly at a cratelike object , as though they were mesmerized . And so on down the apartment , from the bright glowing hearth to the deep shadow by the door , where they were standing , there were four platforms arranged along each wall . And the platforms were something to see . On them had been piled anything and everything that had once furnished the fort . The entire impedimenta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform had turned entirely domestic . On it was a dirty canopy bed , unmade , and with a tossed trundle- cot beneath . Several broken chairs , a small table , old clothes , a cradle , a boot-jack , a wardrobe , and two covered jordans seemed to be having a smug gossip together over what had transpired the night before . This " bedroom " without walls , clatty as it was , appeared indecent by naughty contrast , for all the rest of the place was swept , garnished , and whitewashed . Obviously the fort was but newly domestically occupied . Just then , down the middle aisle between the piled platforms , they saw a tall lantern-jawed man in grimy butternut advancing towards them and about to speak . " Tut-tut , chuck  --  000eee " . . . an indescribably shrill whistle followed , echoed dully amidst the domes . For an instant they thought it must be the man was making fun of them . But he laughed at their natural confusion and held out his hand to Captain Jack . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big lodge night over to Chambers 's , " said he . " Glad to see ye ag'in . None the warse for the trip , eh ? " " Nary a bit , " replied the old hunter . " Here be some travellin ' folks I brought ye . But jist for the noon snack . They 're intendin ' fer Carlisle . " Wal , now , we 'll dish them out some kind o ' fixin 's . Thar 's possum stew awl praties , if they kin take it . My name 's Jim Rutherford , by the way , " he added . Ile extended his hand to Albine carelessly  --  andwinced . " Mr. St. ( lair warned me ye were comin ' . Some of the congregationers that jist passed through here was mighty anxious to have a talk with ye . They ' camped nigh us for four days , so we 're et out like rats in a corncrib. ' fleet 's why thar 's naught but possum stew . No , the fowls ai n't any o ' mine " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I lern , " he said . " That 's right . Her and her man hev tarried behind ' cause o ' wagon trouble . . . . Turkeyfithergentry ! " he whispered , and beckoned them towards the fireplace . That strange shivering whistle sounded again , and a raucous voice that seemed to be cursing itself swore like a sailor . Bridget dashed forward and joined the children peering into the object on the table . For an instant she seemed to be enchanted , too . Then she screamed , " Look , M'lissa , look ! " The voice began to chuckle wickedly . Out of sheer curiosity , it was Salathiel who bent down over the table and looked . Through the bars of a light iron cage with a brass ring on its top , a strange knowing bird sidled away from him on its wooden perch , blinking ; fluffing its feathers ; flexing one glovelike claw in the air thoughtfully . It was green as the scum on a stagnant pool  --  P241and smelt like it . It gave a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't .. . " Poor roll , poor poor Poll , " it said . He saw it talk . He all but fell down and knocked his head on the table out of sheer helpless astonishment . It could n't be true . It was like having one of Nymwha 's firelight beast tales come to life . Impossible  --  but a brutal , blatant fact . The bird talked ! All four children broke into screams of appreciation at finding a big man so obviously sharing their happy wonder . " See ! " said Bridget triumphantly . " Come on over , " whispered Yates to St. Clair , " this is bound to be rare . Our large friend is discovering something entirely new . " Everybody now gathered about the table with the cage on it . The parrot , however , was not entirely pleased at being the centre of so much concentrated attention . He sidled back and forth on his perch , making deprecatory noises . He looked askance . At that moment , as the devil would have it , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small bit of bread to the bird , too confidently perhaps , and chirped at it . Poll now began to strut like an admiral on a quarter-deck during Sunday inspection . He assumed a lofty , aloof , and condescending air . " Walks like ye do , " said Bridget to St. Clair . Mr. Yates chortled . The bird mocked him . Then it cocked its head at St. Clair and winked , " ' Ow now , guvnor , ' ow now ? " it said . " ' Ow 's your ' andsome bowsprit ? " Mr. Yates convulsed , silently this time . Mr. St. Clair beat a hasty retreat to his table and hid his face in the punch bowl . His had been a terrible surprise and shameful repulse . It took two noggins of the best hot arrack to restore his equanimity . At least he was left alone to recover . The bird still continued to be the centre of rapt attention . They were all waiting to hear what he might have to say next . " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear , femininevoice , causing them all to look up . It was the lady in the blue silk dress . She had come over from the fireplace and was standing close beside the table , holding fire tongs before her with something in them that glowed white hot . She was hardly more than a girl , with a grave mouth that threatened to smile at any moment . Her dark hair was a mass o f ringlets and short curls . Her blue eyes shone with a tearful lust re , but the lids were red , either from the fire or from recent weeping . She stood very straight and slight , holding a piece of gleaming stone before her . She was pathetically attractive . They all felt it , and gaped at her .   " Would you mind letting me give Poll what he needs ? " she asked gently . It was Yates who first guessed what she meant . He pulled two of the children away from the cage so she could approach it . Coming closer , she reached forward with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , into a small iron receptacle like a box fixed in the bars of the cage under the perch . The parrot moved over and began to fluff its feathers and stretch out its wings in the grateful glow . It croaked happily . " Well , I 'll be double-damned , " exclaimed Captain Jack . " Hush , " said she in alarm . " You 'll start him swearing , and he'sjust the profanest old  --  " She put a hand over her mouth . When it came away there was a smile there like a gleam of moonlight , and her eyes danced . " He 's very very naughty , but I just love him , " she whispered . " An extremely fortunate old bird , ma'am , " replied Yates , bowing ever so slightly . He might have proceeded further , but the big door at the end of the room opened , and he saw the girl 's sensitive features freeze . A thin middle-aged man in the primmest of black suits came walking down the room . He had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Ile glanced at the group around the parrot 's table indignantly . " It would be much better , madam , if you would give your undividedattention to hurrying the cookery , instead of gossiping idly with these doubtless  --  ah -- very worthy persons , " he added , running his eye over the company . smith in forms me he has all but completed his repairs . As it is , the delay already ... " " Can we take the things with us ? " she interrupted . " Impossible ! " he said icily . She closed her eyes for a moment and stood perfectly still . Only the sound of the chimney draught was audible . Then she turned obediently and went back to the fire . The fowls were done . Her husband stood looking after her for a moment . His mouth tensed . " How do you do , Mr. Preston , " said Yates . " How do you do , sir ? " replied the man , without looking at him . Then he went forward and dragged a small bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back to the company , and awaited his wife 's serving . " Friend of yours ? " inquired Captain Jack sardonically . " Apparently not , " replied Yates . " But I know him . " He shrugged and led the way back to St. Clair 's table , where Jed , who had appearedfrom a dark corner , was hopefully helping set the board with wooden plates and spoons for all . After the potatoes and meat hadP243been piled into one big earthen bowl , and the punch renewed , Mrs. Rutherford and her husband joined the company , while the children held a noisy revel gall their own . Despite that , the parrot went to sleep . The meal began . " Wal , how 's your new venture here afarin ' ? " demanded Captain Jack , addressing the innkeeper . " Tolerable good , considerin ' the fact that most people ai n't acquaint ' yit with the fact that Fort Morris 's now an ordinary , ' stead of a barrack with a garrison . 0 ' course , thar 's feelin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left almost before the Injun war-whoops died away . Still , that ai n't my fault . Them that really knows will blame Shippy . You ca n't beat the Shippens . They 're right in on the council and blood brothers with every governor . The bargain they made when they built the fort was that as soon as the province ceased to garrison it the building and land was thcirn ag'in . And I declare it war n't more than a month after Bushy Run when old Bill Shippen 's son-in-law , Colonel Iiurd , put it up to me about takin ' a lease here . We did n't think much of it at first . Me and the missus like Lancaster . But when the colonel himself ordered the militia out , I seen the light . Naturally , we ai n't doin ' so slick as the widow up the street in the old stone house whar the court usen fer to sit , but we 're comin ' on , and when the childer get bigger and kin help , we 'll jist hum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand down on his wife 's back with enough emphasis and enthusiasm to cause her to lose a half a potato , and to sputter . " Liken we will , " said she finally , putting the potato hack , " with our three girls . And them Old Lights goin ' west was a mighty wind-fall . " " Three hunder and two and thirty of ' em ! " exclaimed Rutherford , " not countin ' the lovin ' couple you see cooin ' together at you table before the fire . They 're goin ' to have to leave a raft o ' fine heavy stuff behind , " he added , lowering his voice . " Weak axletree . I 'll git most o ' it yit , you see . The old boy 's in a fix . His young wife do take on . She wants the parrot and all . Lordy ! But say , do tell me now , Mr. St. Clair , you an ' Mr. Yates ought to know , what be the authorities doin ' to let so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congregationers leave the province ? I thought the Penns wanted the Scotch rifles on the frontiers ? " " Oh , that 's another story , Rutherford , " said St. Clair . " The people that just passed through here are n't Pennsylvanians . They 're a peculiar folk . About a hundred years ago one of the Lords Baltimorebrought their grandfathers over from north Ireland and settledthem in to keep the Quakers and other Pennsylvania people from coming down into Maryland . They settled at a place they called Munster , not so far west of New Castle and the new town of Wilmington , a little back from the Swedes on Christiana Creek . It was like the old border troubles between England and Scotland before the Union . These people were to be a kind of frontier garrison , moss troopers ' for the Baltimores . But Mr. Yates can tell you the rest . He knows all about them . He 's tried to collect rent from them for the Penns , have n't you , Ned ? " " Unhappily , yes , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regiment of dragoons and the lord chancellor himself to collect even a widow 's mite . You see , these people were Church of Scotland , Covenanters , right out of Cromwell 's time . They had n't been settled so long in Ireland when Baltimore brought them over to keep the marches of what he claimed was Maryland . They did that , but they had small use for the Catholic Calverts , and they despised the snivellingQuakers even more . The result was that Munster , and the pleasant valleys about it , became a fine little Presbyterian realm all of its own . Other Scotch-Irish , all stout Church of Scotland , Old Lights ' , as they call them now , joined the first corners from time to time . In a way these folks at Munster were lucky . The Calverts let them alone so long as they did free fightin ' for them and would deny the authority of Penn and his heirs . The border dispute waxed and waned for hal f a century . Nobody really knew in what jurisdictionMunster lay . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The result was , they accepted no earthly rulers . They had none . The only authority they recognized was the voice of God as proclaimed by the minister and by that bell you saw gain ' west today . It was a royal gift from Queen Anne . But after good Anna died , they had no sentiment of loyalty left for the new dynasty . Monarchy was conveniently confined to heaven . " No , that place was an anomaly , " continued Yates , shaking his head in a kind of speculative legal dream . There were no taxes at Munster , only voluntary church tithes . I f the ghost of old John Knox had walked down the village street in M unster five and twenty years ago , he would have seen the Scotland he hoped for in full blossom , and not a malignant for miles around . God 's people alone abode there , presarved , pickled in their own holy vinegar . " About the only bad trouble they had was too many children . Their congregation increased mightily , and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Munster was like a hive that sent out new swarms with ministers for queen bees , if you 'll take the mixed figure . No drones , they ! Half the Scotch-Irish you meet in the colonies seem to hail from there . Maybe it 's a portent . I 've given much thought to it . Theocrats , y'know . Dangerous ! Farmers and warriors with John Knox 's God . Whew !   " Lately the Penns have tried to persuade them to the frontiers to drive back the savages , and then move German farmers in behind them . It 's not a bad policy , but last year the Scotch-Irish frontiersmen came back and nearly overthrew the proprietaries in Philadelphia . If it had n't been for honest Ben Franklin ! Yates shook his head and continued : " What finally moved the people we met today was the settlement of the border case and the new south boundary line agreement . They found they were indisputably in Pennsylvania . They would have to pay quit-rent . My first legal task in this colony was to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a hard bare bone on which I was set to cut my new milk teeth . Bein ' a born Scot , I escaped violence . But hardly . And I brought no shillings back to Philadelphia . The rents are due for nigh a century back . Now they 've gone where no rent will ever be collected by any of the Penns . They were offered lands in the Wyoming valley , if they 'd go there and keep the Yankees out from the New Hampshire grants . But no . The quarrel came to a head at Lancaster , and they took the Virginia government 's offer to go down south to the headwaters of westrunningrivers  --  over the hills and far away . Virginia claims from sea to sea , you know . But I opine where these people are wending few writs will run for a long time to come . They can ring their own bell and let the mountains echo it back again , without any courts to tell them what it means . " " Kind o ' gits ye , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " these poor folks escapin ' from sovrains and lawyers and all that . Wal , thot 's a lawyer 's way o ' lookin ' at it . But you 've pretty nigh left out religion in your legal story . Now , what I know is that the Reverend Alexanders have been preachin '  --  two generations of ' em , father and son  --  since I was a boy , exhortin ' God 's people to h'ist the yoke of Phar-a-oh off their galled necks and prepare fer the journey through the wilderness . They 've got only one book and they 've read it so hard , and had it dinned into their ears so long , that they 're jist livin ' the story o ' comin ' up out of Egypt over ag'in , until they 're more Hebrew than Scotch-Irish . " Of course , it is kind o ' ridiculous tryin ' to make the Penns out to be Phar-a-ohs , they bein ' quiet gentle people mostly , but thar 's always the king to lay it on . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moses , and he 's takin ' the tabernacle and the ark o ' the covenant and the bell along with him to the land of milk and honey . And the Injuns will be the Jebusites and the Malekites and the Blatherskites , and all the other heathen tribes that once infested the Promised Land . Thot 's his story , and they believe him . They are God 's people in their own heads . And what I say is , somethin ' powerful unexpected is liable to come out of sich divine play-actin ' . It 's right ticklin ' to me , sometimes , to think how all the gintry in the City busy themselves bein ' Greeks and Romans , even gettin ' republican in their oratory , while the Scotch on the frontiers be carryin ' on like the hosts of Joshua . Jove and Jehovah !  --  what readin ' books kin do ! " Captain Jack shook his head lugubriously , too , and took a drink out of Mr. Yates 's punch mug . " Bein ' as all this is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , what teched off this particular gang fer to leave the land of bondage was a schiz-izzm in their midst . Yes , sirree , the New Lights ! They do n't hold so strict to not pleasurin ' themselves any as the Auld Lichts do , an ' they 've even durst set up a synod of their own over at Philadelphy to deny the authority o ' the Kirk o ' Scotland in the colonies . Why , only last year , the Reverend Alexander 's favorite daughter , Sarah , up and married her a New Light husband . Her preachin ' father caw n't bear to think on it . So he 's goin ' west , where no more of the children of his loins will be snared into burnin ' forever in hell 's fire and hev to cry to God in vain out of the tarnal furnace . Oh , to be an Auld Licht , to be an auld Auld Licht ! You gentlemen with your reasonable new ways , you forgit . Maybe the forest will quench the auld licht and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye somethin ' , it 's a huge land they 're headed fer . " Not so many moons ago came a young man to my cabin to spend the night . On his way south to Car'lina , lie was . Man by the name o ' Boone from old Uerks ( ' cnmty . I lc said Ien Franklin once arranged a mortgage on his pap 's farm. * As fer him , he was clanged tired of such lawycrisms , seein ' thar 's so much empty land no parchmentscover , and all he needed was a rifle-gun to foreclose . He 'd bin way down the Ohio gittin ' hntIalo lucks , hum in ' all summer . Then in the fall the Shawanees took ' cm all off him . He kind o ' wanted a little advice from me about dint . Well , we talked as long as the pine knots lasted . He sez the land 's wait in ' thar west of the mountain , big as the full moon , swarming with critters , a dark forest with limestonesprings , glades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivers thar , too . It 's the loamy Eden of God 's fresh creation , vargin , wonderful ! And he knows a gap through the rivers in Car'lina handy to option .

I sez , Do n't ruin yer eyes with no fine print , jist keep ' em bright fer gittin ' the beads of yer Pennsylvania rifle-gun in line . An ' do n't let the Injuns holler ye out o ' them hills neither . Git the people started , and in one generation we palefaces will outfornicate the redskins five to one . You 'll be seized and entitulated into that land by pure force of gism and a Nolan , J. Bennett , " Ben Franklin 's Mortgage on the Daniel Boone Farm . "   little gunpowder and lead . ' Thot 's what I laid down to young Dan ' ! Boone , and I wisht to the Lord I could live to see the day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an even better country . " ' Suddenly , Captain Jack shut his mouth like a clam . St. Clair smiled into Yates 's single eye . " I 've made that myreligion , too , " he said . Let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments , ' " murmured Yates . " Oh , the devil with all that rantin ' stuff , too , " snapped St. Clair . " Look , it 's nigh half after one by my watch , " interrupted Salathiel , displaying his timepiece proudly , " and it 's three longleagues into Carlisle . For myself , I 'd like to be gettin ' on . " flFrances was only in partial agreement with him . While the menI had been talking , she had been listening to what snatches of conversationfrom the couple dining before the fire she could overhear . It was not much , but what she had heard confirmed her in her sympathy for the young wife in the blue silk dress , and she wanted to heart more . Still , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had it not been that everybody else 's attention was suddenly focused in the same direction as Melissa 's . Mr. Preston had risen from his chair , evidently in grim anger , and he now announced in a voice that reverberated dismally , " Woman , if I 've told you once , I 've told you a score of times , we I , canna take the bed with us ! That bed ! It may be rosewood and cedar , or it may have been Grandma LeTort 's bridal bower and death couch too . But ' t is too massive a piece for the axles of the wagon to bear . ' T is a catafalque with urns carved from massive shittim wood , a four-cornered hearse that needs wheels in its own right and six horses dight with plumes to draw it . " Mr. Preston wiped his mouth , and looked at his wife . " But the spinet , my poor little harpsichord ! " pleaded the girl , now openly tearful . " It 's light , it will ride . " See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mollify the marble . " Look ! It 's very light . " In her desperation , she went over to the wall and dragged a small spinet out from a pile of furniture , putting it in the firelight where all could see . Its wires sang faintly . They seemed to sigh . " Hear ? " she said . " How can you still listen to it , Andrew ? " " Felice , " said her husband icily , " I 'll have no sich godless instrument in the hoose . The meenisters will not permeet it . Your profane bird is the only conceesion to balladry I 'll make . " " I 'll have a last song then , " she cried desperately . " And will ye stay to hear it , Andrew Preston ? Durst ye listen to a swan song ? " " Aye , I 'll hear ye oot , " he replied , and folded his arms stoically.  | " Candles , madam , candles , if you please ! " the girl cried to Mrs. Rutherford . Meanwhile , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a more central position before the fire , and with the fierce energy of anger . Two candles were brought her by the puzzled Mrs. Rutherford . These she took with shaking hands , lit them at the hearth , and returning , placed them in two small sconces on either side of the instrument . A tense drama of protest informed every motion of her body . Unconsciously , she was making a ritual to express what she durst not fully say . There was no one , not even her husband , who was not now intensely aware of this . The children stared and were suddenly quiet . Yates and St. Clair stood up the better to see . She sat down at the instrument , with the firelight behind her and the twin stars of the candles gleaming beside her face . She tossed her curls back , opened the spinet , and looked at Mr. Preston fixedly . To Salathiel , who had not the slightest idea what the instrument was for , the ivory keys grinned as though a horse had skinned its lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck swept him with a shock of overwhelming amazement . He was caught as though in the undertow of a wave and swept into an unsuspected sea of melody . The quills striking on the little wires rang charmingly with small twanging echoes iii the inverted cups of the stone ceiling . He sat there drowning in lovely sound . Music finally closed over his head .. . She ranged slowly upward on the chords of an octave , her voice gaining smoothness and power as it rose . A little husky at first , it was soon clear and lovely again . It was plain to St. Clair and Yates what she was doing . She had lost herself in memory and was practisingon the keyboard as a child . Presently she hummed a brief nursery rhyme , accompanying Herself . " Then quickly , after the ripple of a merry prelude , came the full tide of a song . It was something about a famous general who always rode a-cock-horse before going to sleep in his mother 's lap . In the next stanzas he grew up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wars to his bride . She soared now into the last verse , her voice ringing liquidly , with a little harplike banter on the upper keys  --  as the soldier 's bride replied " And who so very boldWhen battles ' round him rolled , But that he would that heWere even now as weAre now , my love , in arms , In arms , in mutual arms , Away from war 's alarms ? "  |p249The  voice ceased ; the music went on quietly , seeming to relate a wordless tale of ardent melancholy . In the candlelight the girl 's face became languidly composed and grave . Her hands slowed from flashing whitely , paused , and roved gradually down the keyboard into the sad minors of an ancient hymn : " Sun of My Soul , arise , arise , Display thy glory to mine eyes ; Star of My Life , what e'er betide , Lord of My Life , abide , abide . " She closed the harpsichord softly , as though she were saying amen with the covers , and then stood by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tears traced down her cheeks . She leaned over and kissed the dark wood that dimly reflected her . She blew out the candles . He stood there waiting for her . " Do you remember ? " she asked in a low tone as she passed him . " Do you remember , Andrew , how it was when you first came to the old house at LeTort 's Springs ? " " Yes , " he said , " but why will ye ' mind me of those pretty times now ? " " Because , " she replied , " because . . . " She hesitated for a moment  --  and then , going over to the children 's table , slipped a flannel cover over the iron cage and , taking it by its brass ring with two fingers , stood waiting for him resignedly . " Come , " she said , for he still looked at her with some doubt . " Ca n't you see I 'm ready ? " IIe came forward then and offered her his arm . " At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me , " she added . He let her have the last word . She laid her hand over his arm , and they walked down the long room together , her shoulders beginning to droop . Neither of them looked back . " Poor Poll , Poll 's a-cold , " croaked the parrot , as the door swung open revealing the bleak street beyond . Then it closed firmly behind them . There was a moment 's utter silence before they heard the rollingsound of iron wheels commence and then diminish down the street . " The poor darlint , oh , that poor , poor darlint ! " exclaimedFrances , springing up and going over to lay her own hands on theabandoned spinet . " And him like an old dry pipe stem . Oh , Mr.Rutherford , will ye not be takin ' the best care of her pretty things ? " " For a year and a day , ma'am , " replied Rutherford . " For that , P250I 'm to be paid . Afterwards  --  who knows ? Mr. Preston is a hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's plunder when he will not house it himself . " The landlord of Fort Morris turned away to collect his reckoning for the meal  --  3s 6d , which Captain Jack paid , and 3s for St. Clair 's punch . Captain Jack said nothing , but continued to wait quietly at the table while the company broke up . Presently he beckoned to Frances and began to explain to her that she was to say nothing to Salathiel about his staying behind ; and that his horse was to be driven on to Carlisle . He 'd made arrangements for sending for it later . " No use of havin ' a big set-to now , " he said . " I ai n't in a mood to take it . " All indeed was now in full bustle for the final departure for Carlisle . Jed was taking the nosebags off the horses and tightening the girth of his saddle . The women went to the jaques and the men to an intimate corner against the rear wall outside . Incidentally , the recent departure of Mr. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of departure for foreign parts , remarked Yates . " Ifen you 're movin ' west over the mountains , you ca n't carry all your heavy furniture along . It just stands to reason , " grumbled Rutherford . " Mr. Preston is leaving behind a good deal more than his furni-ture . " " Ile is , " agreed St. ( - lair . " I 'd like to bring the serpent to his knees . " " That would involve you in a coil of difficulties , Arthur , " laughed Yates . " Besides , the mans an attorney , and a good one . He has represented the Minister congregations for years . I heard him argue the quit-rent case before Justice Allen . In fact , I was representing the proprietary interest then myself . " " And won ? " " Yes , but as you see , it was a Pyrrhic victory . " " He married him his wife just recently , " volunteered Rutherford . " Reckon he needed a young partner for the western wilds . She 's a Huguenot lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first settled-in at LeTort Springs fer fur tradin ' . You 'll hear about them at Carlisle . Guess it was mostly her old family stuff he 's left behind . " " I 've no doubt , " said St. Clair . A general buttoning-up followed . Just then someone passed at breakneck speed riding up the town street at a furious gallop . " Sounds like an express , " remarked Rutherford . " They often go tearin ' right through here for Carlisle . P251Say , did ye hear they say Buckey 's started marchin ' from Fort Pitt ? Might be at Bedford now . " " They say , ' " quoted St. Clair scornfully . " What do n't they say ? The last I heard , Bouquet was due to march east by April at the earliest . " " Ye ca n't be sure , " mused Albine ; " now that he 's been promoted , maybe he 's in a hurry to wind everything up . " But none of them thought any more of the rumour . It seemed unlikely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the winter . besides , they had more immediate affairs of their own to consider . While St. Clair stood in the street before Fort Morris , giving final instructions to Salathiel about waiting for the expected Ligonier emigrants at Carlisle , Frances and Bridget were inside , saying goodbye to Captain Jack . The old hunter was going home to his cabin on jack 's Mountain . He would not be moved by any argument . He wished no fuss to be made about it . " It 's jist come over me again , " he said , " I must be alone . Tell yer young man I 'll send fer him at Carlisle if I ever need him . Rutherford 's bound boy here knows the trail to my old mountain shack . Now , git along without worryin ' Sal any about me . Keep the horse till I send for it . ' Tai n't any use havin ' Sal arguin ' with me at the last . Good-bye , and God be forever with ye , my dears . " Bridget threw her arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instant or two he showed any emotion . They left him sitting at the table filling his pipe . When they hurried out , Salathiel was already in the seat , waiting , and the wagon drawn out into the street ready to move . St. Clair and Yates had ridden on ahead . They were going to the land office at Lancaster and were in a hurry . Jed was sitting on Tina , round-eyed , expounding something to Salathiel . " Yas , sah , it was sure him , de pastor what preached at ( liambers Mills yesterday . He done pass through hyah on his big jack mule like hot spit through a knot hole . And he hollers somethin ' out to me real loud . Somethin ' about a Marse John Gilpin . When I tell Marse Yates that , he jes larf like hell . He say he Link de reverend 'll sure git to Carlisle fustest . " " All right , Jed , " smiled . Albine , " I guess Mr. Craighead 's mule has decided to go back home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way , if you want to get to Carlisle , too . " " All right in the wagon ? " he called back . " All set and comfortable , " replied Melissa 's sweet voice . " Please drive easy , Sal . The horses be tired . " He had no idea Captain Jack was not in there with the women . He slapped the reins . The yoke bells chimed faintly , and they rumbled off up the long street of Shippensburg , bound for Carlisle . It was the last leg of the journey , the final stretch of the western military road that lay before them . He thought of that with a satisfactionimpossible to exaggerate . The forest and the fort on the Ohio , where he had begun the journey " long ago " with Captain Ecuyer , lay actually only two hundred miles westward , and on the calendar not so far backward in time . And yet , measured in terms of fruitful experience and the span of his own lifetime , the country behind the mountains and all its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than aeons behind him . Certainly in terms of his own personality , an entire age away . He had left old Kaysinata standing in the moonlight on the banks of Beaver Creek . Then he was a callow and savage boy . The Little Turtle had left the Big Turtle behind in the wilderness . He had been given an axe that evening and warned never to eat turtle meat . This afternoon it was Salathiel Albine aware of himself and his shortcomings as a white man ; aware of the past and the future ; of God ; of the world about him , and of heaven and hell . He could not help thinking of it that afternoon as he approached Carlisle , with surprise , and perhaps a certain justifiable satisfaction . From Yellow Breeches ( ' reel : that rolled to the Susquehanna through the valleys only a few miles before him to the westwardflowingOhio was scarcely fifty leagues measured on paper maps . But the mountains of a might y frontier lay between . He had crossed them from boyhood into manhood , from darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaysinata and enter into the inheritancebefore him . Almost he had been disinherited . All this , in a kind of grand symbol stamped upon the face of the landscape itself , seemed to be made visible to him that afternoon as he looked north and westward to the twinkling ranges of the Blue Mountains , whose crests rolled like a school of enormous fish leapingalong the horizon . They were not really so far away , but in the blue haze of the dying winter daylight they seemed to be withdrawingthemselves , travelling away from hum , into an incredible distance and a remoter time . The southmost of the big school of fish was the one they called Jack 's Mountain , alone , detached , high and forbidding . Some low clouds dragged across it and concealed its crest . That was where the old hunter had his cabin . Pretty soon Captain Jack would be seeing his last sunset up there  --  but he , Salathiel , would not think of that yet . They might still have some happy and peaceful days together at Carlisle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After Carlisle he would not see the mountains any more at all . They were marching away from him now . They would soon be lost behind the horizon . They would become mountains of mysterious memory only , mountainsof the moon . He said a brief silent prayer of thanks and hope . He pulled the horses up and lit his pipe in the face of the winter wind , and tossed Jed a twist of shag to chew . He liked that genial and simple-hearted character . He needed his ever-cheerful help . He was glad St. Clair had agreed to leave him behind for a while longer . In a way it was palming Jed off for his keep , but in the end St. Clair had been decent enough . He had given him ten guineas as a retainer and pay for the time he might have to wait at Carlisle . If no settlers showed up for Ligonier by the end of two months , the arrangement would be cancelled . That was the bargain , and so far good enough . Hard coin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a bit tired after the morning 's pace . But what was the difference , they were almost there now . Anyway the family would have to sleep in the wagon that night . Yates said there was n't a house or a hut to be had at Carlisle , not for love , money , or influence . Oh , well . . : But he would miss Yates . He hoped he would catch up with him again soon . Clear and ever colder the wind swept down out of the northeast . The road , badly rutted by transport , led away straight and steadily over low rolling hills of mixed woodlands and cleared farm lands . The land was bleak , deserted , and desolate . They passed no one coming west . They stopped only once . It was to retrieve a white object caught in the limbs of an old pear tree that leaned low across the road . It was a clerical bag wig , hung there by its ribbons like a deserted oriole nest . This time it would take considerable repairing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed and passed it back to Bridget to lay away . Then the patient teams began walking forward again . As the early November twilight dimmed rapidly into the smooth darkness of a low cloud-hung night , a deep red glow burned brighter and ever more widely across the sky above the black outlines of tumbling forest . By eight o'clock they seemed to be approaching an immense conflagration . The clouds ran and slobbered with scarlet . It was the reflection of a thousand campfires , the united glow from the greatest military base in the colonies and the rallying point of the western frontier . Carlisle . At half past nine they pulled up in the broad open town square , drew water from the king 's well , had a brief bite of supper , sent Jed with all the horses to Stottelmyer 's stables , and turned in for the night . The journey was over . But Salathiel longed for morning . He was impatient to see what the dawnlight might have to reveal . P255A Beautiful Whip Changes Hands " SIX O'CLOCK of a clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagons , fifteen to report . " Thus chanted the sentries of the garrison at Fort Lowther and the cracked voices of the two old codgers of the Carlisle town watch , seeming to mock one another in chorus . The watch rattled their staffs and passed on towards breakfast and their senile mendacities about Queen Anne 's War , over small beer and scrapple . It was still dark , but Salathiel bestirred himself . He slipped into his old buckskins more out of habit than design , and popping an iron saucepan on a spider over a charcoal fire , busied himself preparing a hot morning stew . The bag of charcoal in the side-chest with the smith 's tools now came in unexpectedly handy . All about him in the starry darkness numerous invisible people were hunting or trying to borrow fuel from one another  --  anything , old worm-fence , even the splintered hickory spokes of a broken wheel would do . Obviously the " ark " was not the only wagon on the square , the outlines of which were gradually becoming visible in the oncoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stir and talk in sleepy voices behind the canvas . It seemed strange without the horses and no work to do . It was lonely without Captain Jack . Doubtless , Jed would show up soon for victuals , and with news . He could always be depended on to do both . While he stood , still a bit sleepy , watching the coals glowing under the pot in the morning darkness , he turned over in his mind the possible reasons for Captain Jack 's unexpected decision to remainbehind at Shippensburg . He had been not a little nettled and disconcerted last evening , when he first discovered that the old hunter was not along with them in the wagon . Frances ought to have told him , he insisted . He did n't relish being fooled like that . But as he listened to her explanations , he finally had to admit that she had probably acted for the best . It would have done no good to have had a painful parting yesterday at Fort Morris . And that was what it would have come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Half-Indian . His obstinate whims and moods were his law . Besides , Salathiel knew better than anyone else that when the necessity to be alone overtook Captain Jack , nothing could move him . All he hoped was that it was n't the " scalp-fever " running in his veins again . But probably not ; not any more . No , it must have been a deep longing for the refuge of his lonely cabin that had suddenly seized upon the old man . He could n't support lively companionship for any length of time . Certainly Captain Jack must have wanted to get away awful bad , when he had just let them drive on , and told Melissa to keep his horse until he sent for it . That was surely a sign he meant to keep in touch . Well , he would use the old gelding carefully . He 'd take care of it as a trust . Later on he might pay the old man a visit in his mountain eyrie . But , my , how he 'd miss him ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him at Carlisle . How unexpectedly things turned out ! Maybe the old hunter just wanted to die in peace . And a body was entitled to do his own ( lying , he supposed . But he did n't much relish that idea . Ile sat staring into the fire fixedly for a spell , while the grey light slowly dawned in the east . Finally , he shook himself clear of such doleful speculations and looked up . Sunrise was late that November morning , and yet the dawn , when it did begin , seemed to come swiftly . The details of the scene surrounding him emerged from a mist of wood smoke and fading stars into a firm , clear background of houses , people , roads , and streets . He was in a wide-open town square , ( lotted here and there with wagons camping overnight like liiuisclf , and surrounded on three sides by dwelling houses ; some of them of two or more stories , built of brick , stone , or logs , with ample yards and gardens between . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were a log courthouse with a strong jail , an unfinished town hall already of promising proportions , and churches . About these buildings , especially at the south end of the square , there was already a considerable passing to and fro of people , a gradual assembling of horses and vehicles , as the business of the day got under way . An incessant barking of dogs and a rumbling of wagons , the lowing of cattle , and the spreading cry of crowing roosters combined with distant shouts , all in crescendo as the dawnP 257intensified behind the eastern wall of the forest , gave the impression of a far-flung and teeming neighbourhood rousing itself eagerly . The atmosphere was clear . The storm had passed on . A light powdery snow , smoking whitely now and then in the winter breeze , lay in scattered patches on the roofs and ground . Ranks of brick chimneys curled forth blue smoke leisurely . A convoy of white-topped wagons , lanthorns still glowing yellow in the grey morning light , came down the Lancaster road and gatheredwaiting before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiming faintly . Here and there a sow and her brood emerged speculatively into the open square . Somewhere an anvil began to clang . A woman called shrilly and banged a house door . He stopped stirring the pot and stood up to look eagerly about him . His nose wrinkled . A faint underlying fetid odour and a smell of communal cooking and wood smoke both tainted and savoured the air . He smiled slowly . To him , at least , the general impression of Carlisle was overwhelmingly metropolitan ; almost everywhere he looked there were people . And yet , there was something uneasy and confusing about it . He felt that from the very first . The east end of the square , however , was quite another matter . There the familiar aspects of the western frontier still held sway . In that direction the public square was half pre-empted and solidly occupied by the broad front of Fort Lowther . Its stockaded log walls , over twelve feet high and two hundred feet long , extended across the eastern vista with squat-roofed rifle towers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still blindly closed . The small postern beside it , however , already swarmed with a gathering crowd of leather-aproned workmen carrying their tools and awaiting admittance . Officers of the Pennsylvania line in green and regulars in scarlet regimentals began to emerge from their various boarding-houses and ordinaries about the square and to stroll across it towards the fort , buckling on their side-arms , laughing and talking , while the sky lightened overhead . Behind the stockade itself a tentative humming of drums and a muffled tootling of fifes preluded the formation for morning roll call . As the sun rose suddenly out of the forest mists some miles away , a field piece boomed . The shrill music of the reveille squealed and rolled . A prolonged pulsing of drums shivered the air as the Union Jack unfurled into the sunlight . The lanthorns went out . The portals of the fort rolled backward , and the waiting crowd and wagons rushed in . All the town noises suddenly heightened and became more confident . Horses began to trot , and men to walk faster . The day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wagon to come out and eat . And while the music played " The World Turned Upside Down " and the hoarse shouting of many roll calls filled the air , they had breakfast together under the open sky in the public square . It is a fair surmise that there were not many other people in the world that morning enjoying their breakfast so thoroughly as Salathiel . The victuals were a plain example of hard-boiled simplicity , but the mood in which they were eaten provided a sauce piquante with an ultimate satisfaction that no culinary artifice could have contrived . Circumstances themselves seemed to have melted together into a smooth wine gravy which blent perfectly with his every bite . The tense apprehension of lurking danger had gone . In its place was a calm sense of safety and pride in its achievement . Instead of the doubtful silence of the forest , on every hand now was the confident early cheerfulness of the town . Its morning noises had a bell-like quality of silver and crystal happiness about them . Salathiel filled his pipe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose . His eyelids drooped half over his pupils , and he sat looking down like an Indian lost entirely in the present , immersed in a sheer complacencyof well-being . After a few minutes , he aroused slowly as the hell before the courthouse began with its insistent clamour to proclaim all 's well , all 's well . He smiled as Frances looked at him happily , her eyes wide and calm . A few moments later Jed shoved up , covered with stable straw , and looking serious and much cast down . The wagonmaster at Stottelmyer'shad refused to release the horses to him when he had asked for them that morning . Ile had had an argument with the man , who had struck him painfully with a hull whip . Ile ate his mush and bacon slowly , with tears in his eyes . Marse Albine did n't seem to make much of it . Jed supposed he would just have to take it . That 's the way things went in this mad world . Marse Albine even seemed pleased . He grinned at everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granny . " Afterwhile , " said Salathiel  --  " afterwhile . It may take a few hours to find your grandma . " To Frances ' eager questioning as to where they were going to find shelter , he had the same laconic answer . They would find a house " afterwhile " . His satisfaction in both appearance and expression was infractible . He ate heartily and was not to be hurried . They had come a long long way . " Afterwhile , " he kept saying  --  " afterwhile . " Afterwhile  --  he rose and entered the wagon . So ! They had begun by striking poor Jed with a whip ! Well , he knew how to deal with people like that . Doubtless Stottehnyer hadp259not yet returned . It must have been someone in temporary authority . But  --  he looked at Twin-Eyes in her sling , and considered . He decidedfinally to let her rest . Then he slipped Kaysinata 's axe in his belt , set his coonskin cap at a truculent angle , and stepped out . When he got Enna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fixins . Meanwhile , his present rig was more suitable for what he had in mind to do . Just to make sure of it , he reached down into the ashes of the breakfast fire and smeared his face thoughtfully with a bit of charcoal . Frances rose with anxiety and laid a hand on his arm . " You be careful , Mister Albine , " she said . " This is no place for war paint . " He nodded and laughed . " Just a bit of funnin ' , sweetheart , is all I hev in view . Now do n't worry , I 'll see you under a roof tonight , or I 'm a son of a gun ! " " Big man , " said Bridget , looking at him doubtfully , " Grandma Lamed 's a lady . I know she is . You might be mistook in a dirty face . " " I 'll sure gentle her , " he said . " Now help your ma to look after the wagon . I 'll be back  --  afterwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the square towards the town hall , with Jed toilingafter him , the burn of the whip stinging across his shoulders . The two women stood looking uncertainly after them . " Now what the divil 's got into him ? " mused Melissa . " He looks like a Black Boy renegade . " The fifteen wagons that had been called for that morning , and a half score more , were crowded about the new town hall , of which so far only the lower story was in use . Twenty-five competing drivers were trying to crowd at the same time into the bureau of the provincialcommissary , a small room off the main hall . In there John Byers , Esquire , the wagon commissioner , was bargaining like mad for his king and country with eight Pennsylvania Dutchmen at once , and enjoying it . A convoy was making up to fetch barrelled beef from Baltimore by way of York . It was eight o'clock already , and so far nobody had been hired . Mr. Byers was masterfully roaring them down . His voice was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened for a moment with amusement . Well , if anybody knew what was going on at Carlisle , it would be Mr. Byers , the wagon commissioner , he judged . But the present thunderous moment was not entirely auspicious for questioning him , he felt . He would wait . He then gave himself over to reading the innumerable notices , old proclamations , orders , and handbills pasted on the walls of the vestibule . P 260No wonder Mr. Byers had his troubles with wagoners . Just look at that  --  and an old notice , too , half torn off and fluttering in the wind : The order dated from Brigadier General Stanwix 's time . Underneath it was pinned an old certificate of the finding of a court-martial , signedHe stopped for a moment and bowed his head before that fingersmeareddocument . How was it that a mere piece of paper could continue to exist  --  while the captain . . . ? Oh , where , oh , where was he ? Presently his vision cleared , and he resumed reading .. .

The sad loss of Monsieur de Molyneaux seemed trivial in view of the contents of some of the other notices . This business of keeping slaves , too  --  there was something unchristian about it , a lazy fancy , he thought . At any rate , he would catch up with the bully who had lashed Jed . A fine lout , no doubt .. . The rest of the wall was covered with rewards , and pathetic appeals in script , attempts to get news of or some word to those captured by the Indians . Hope , tragedy , and despair fluttered on the wainscoting , fading , being blown away and trampled underfoot . And here was the latest printed list , evidently quite a recent oneLIST of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones , the homeless , over two hundred . He stood pondering this list of names long and carefully . He checked it against the roll that sang itself in his own mind . Yes , most of them were there , but some were absent . There might be several reasons for that . But it would do no harm to recite those lost names again to the brigadier . It might mean the salvation of some poor soul , some " adopted " victim . By God , he would see the general . He 'd sing him a pretty tune , even if he had to stand in front of his tent before reveille . And what had McArdle done about it ? he wondered . Just then a mass of wagoners rushed out of the commissary bureau , pursued by the admonitory roars of Mr. Byers ; snapping their whips joyfully  --  hired ! Jed cowered on the outside steps as they passed . The unchosen also departed , but sullenly . Silence resumed its reign unharassed by Mr. Byers . Salathiel strolled into the commissionei 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot o f papers into a handle-box , evidentlypreparing to leave . " Well , sir , what the devil can I do for you ? " said Mr. Byers , looking up at last . He then saw fit to clear his throat respectfully . His visitor rubbed a bit of charcoal off his chin . " Mr. Byers , can you remember names ? " asked Salathiel . " B'God , I 'm ravished in my vargin sleep by ' em , " rumbled the commissioner . " Come midnight , a lisle-tailed St. Cecilia sits by my pillow and treacles my ears with the dulcet Dutch cognomens of half the blasted wagoners in German Pennsylvania . Arbeleist , Bendendorp , Reinhold , Hogendorper , Weisenkrantz , Schimmelpfennig  --  the damned burly ruffians , never a decent English syllable or native virtue in the lousy lot . God save the mark , his Majesty , and me ! "  | " Amen to all that , " added Salathiel . " But did ye ever hear of one Campion Honeywell "  --  he drew Mrs. Larned 's letter from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in the square here at Carlisle ? " " On the square , and on the level , I never did , " mused Mr. Byers , looking at his visitor meaningly . Salathiel gave him the sign . Mr. Byers replied by producing a jug . " Are ye one of Buckey 's new Virginia rifles ? " he inquired , after his turn at swallowing . " Nope , I jist range the woods private with Captain Jack , doin ' what good I kin in leafy places . " " Oh ! " said Byers , looking a bit startled , " of that doughty brotherhood , eh ? Maybe you carry a twin rifle-gun , brother ? " " Happen sometimes I do . " They both laughed . " Now , that 's curious odds , " continued Byers . " The Reverend Mr. Craighead was talkin ' about you and Captain Jack only last night . Better let me see that letter , I guess , " he added , reaching out over the table . Salathiel handed it to him . Mr. Byers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to time . " Seems maybe the old lady got some of her Boston names confused in this , " he remarked finally . " I know of no Honeywells at Carlisle . But , tell ye what , the rider that carried that letter to Lyttleton will know . The old lady must have given it to him . And he 's here . " Stepping to the door , Mr. Byers roared , " Fergus , Jim Fergus ? " in the tones of an irritated lion . " Presently , sir , presently , " replied a pleasant voice . In another moment a bow-legged little man in a semi-military riding rig came into the room , his spurs clanking . Salathiel recognizedhim instantly as one of the intrepid express riders who had carried letters between Bouquet and Ecuyer during the siege at Fort Pitt . " The unsung heroes of the frontier , " the captain had called them . The recognition was mutual . Fergus nodded pleasantly to Salathiel . " What do ye lack , Mr. Byers ? " he said , his eyes twinkling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his meat . " Mr. Byers relented . Express riders were privileged people ; the survivors among them , few . " Our big friend here wants to know if ye can recall a certain old widow woman , a Mistress Theodosia Lamed from Boston town . Here 's the letter she gave you for Patton 's some time ago . " Fergus looked at it and the superscription briefly . " Why , sartain , sure , " he said , " precious old Yankee grandma with nice bright silver hair . Neat as a new pin . Do n't tell me you 're bringing her little grand-daughter ? She 'll be transfigured into Glory at the sight of her . Could n't talk about nothin ' else , poor soul . When I gave her Mr. Patton 's reply back from Lyttleton , I thought she 'd melt in her own eye-water . Last I talked to her , she was fixin ' to go to Manoah Glen 's mill at Bilin ' Springs in the mill wagon . Not a nook or cranny for her here . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Glen 's mill . Ye know , I 'd clean forgot . Thar 's so clang many troubled ones hereabouts keep pesterin ' me for letters . " For a moment he looked troubled himself . " I 'd try to find her today , ifen I was you . Ye kin , ye know , ' tai n't far to Bilin ' Springs . " " Just drive east past LeTort 's old stockade , and take the south wending trace at the first forks , " said Byers . " The Springs be about eight miles from there . Ye ca n't miss the big mill at the ford  --  and all . " So Mrs. Larned knew they were coming ! Still Salathiel hesitated . Then he decided to tell Mr. Byers about the predicament over having the horses detained , and the probability of Stottelmyer 's still being away . He did n't want the stable-boys to raise a hue and cry when he came to take them . " Stop thief "  --  it might be awkward . He explained at some length . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The stable-boys do n't own the nags . And I judge you be entitled to ' cm until Stottelmyer returns . If they make any trouble out at the stables for ye , tell ' em I said the province has hired ' cm . I 'll put the two wagon teams on the special emergency roll . No use splittin ' hairs about it now . ' T is an errand of marcy you 're on . " " That 's mighty damn civil of ye , " replied Salathiel . " ' Tai n't much , " replied Byers , carried away by his own generosity . " Stottelmyer 'll probably be back in town with Bouquet in a few days ' time at most . Jim here just rid in with the dispatches . They 've marched from Fort Pitt . " " Might be pulling out of Bedford now , " added Fergus . " You do n't say ! " exclaimed Albine . " Now , that is news ! " Mr. Byers looked embarrassed . " So it is , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see . I 'll have to ask you to put the seal on it . If it gets out too soon , the confusion here will be thrice confounded . There 's nigh three hundred strangers waitin ' to claim their kin . And crowds of other gentry , none so savoury . Do you see ? " 1 " I 'll button my gab tight , my word on it , " Salathiel assured him . " Now thank ye ever so kindly , and give my regards to Mr. Craigheadtoo . Tell him I 'm nigh , and I 'll be returnin ' his wig directly . I.4 found it hangin ' on a pear tree . " " Now did ye ? " guffawed Byers , slapping his breeches . " That 'll pleasure him . His temper 's as bald as his pate at losin ' it . Come overP265and see us when ye kin . It 's the small stone house , third down the west walk on the square  --  have another ? " " No , thanks , " answered Salathiel . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear war-whoops up at Stottelmyer 's stable , do n't turn out the garrison . " He winked , and they shook hands cordially . " Whoop away ! I 'll just hold my hand on my hair if I hear ye , " said Mr. Byers . " All right , Jim . Thanks . " They went out together while Mr. Byers returned to packing up his papers . " Here 's a little somethin ' I maunt tell ye , " said Fergus , as they walked out . " Thar 's an old Injun and his family sort of lurkin ' fertivelike on Yellow Breeches Creek nigh the Glens ' mill . Doctor Scarlet they call him . He 's an old yarb gatherer . Digs mandrakes and sich for the Chinee trade . Harmless . One of the convarted . Thought I 'd jist mention him . The magistrates are all in a tither since the Lancaster jail massacre , you know . And poor old Doctor John was took off here not so long ago with horrid consequences . So I 'd jist say how-how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' sang , or buy a little rattlesnake ile off him for old sake 's sake , like . It 'll make smoother rubbin ' fer ye here , ifen you do . " Fergus looked quizzically at Salathiel . " Makeum heap good medicine , " promised Salathiel . " And if anythinghappens to Doctor Scarlet , do n't blame me . I 'm not warrin ' on the Moravian convarts . All my scalps are lifted clean and honest , west of the proclamation line . " " Sure , sure , " said Fergus , " I was jist talkin ' in case . Say , do ye ever wrestle like ye used to at Fort Pitt ? I seed ye there when ye was dandying the little captain . Guess ye miss him , like we all do , eh ? " " Mighty much , Jim , " said Salathiel . " You might ride over and have a snack with us when we git to Glen 's mill . Reckon I might stay there if I find the old lady , and the miller could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warse , " said Fergus . " Shelter 's mortal scarce in Carlisle . And you kin be quiet at the mill . I know you woodsmen like to be private . I 'll track ye down at the mill shortly . J ist now I 've got some dispatches for Colonel Burd over at Lancaster . " " Now , have ye ! " said Salathiel . " Maybe , then , you can take this letter from Colonel Chambers to Colonel Burd ? When ye git back I 'll look for ye at the mill . " Jim took the letter , and they shook hands warmly . Salathiel had taken a positive shine to the man . Now to the work at hand at Stottelmyer 's stable . He meant to have the use of the horses . And the sooner he got to Boiling Springs that morning the better . " Come on , Jed , " he called . " We 're goin ' clown to Stottelmyer 's stable , and I want ye to pint out the bugger that lashed ye . "   and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrels , and axes , all arranged by kind in blocked heaps and piles , took up at least twothirdsof the room with aisles between . Here and there rough open stairs and ladders ascended through the gloom into the loft above . At the far end of the place , however , a narrow glazed window ran clear across the end wall near the ceiling , and the lighted floor space under it had been kept relatively clear . There in fact was the office of the establishment , furnished with rude pine desks and tables and several bookkeepers ' stools . These were vacant now . But standing with his back to the light , and leaning over a table , with a quill pen in his hand , an open ledger and stacks of small coins before him , was an elephantine , moon-faced individual . He was arranging coins in various amounts and checking the ledger , diligently . Projecting downward near-by on a ladder from the ceiling were the legs of another man . He was evidently busy shifting something about on the floor of the loft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Salathiel looked the prospect over carefully , and rapidly elaboratedhis strategy . The part of the room with the equipment piled in it was comparatively dark ; the portion where the two men were working , relatively bright . Doubtless the man at the desk was Stottelmyer'swagonmaster , Hans Schmidt . Salathiel had heard rumours of him at Bedford . I lis name was a byword . Ile bore a hard reputationeven among wagoners , who were not a gentle folk . Salathiel beckoned to Jed to enter and pointed out to hint the man at the desk . " Dat 's de man , lot 's him ! " whispered Jed , instinctively shrinking back against the wall . " 1 lira got a bull whip two rods long ! " If so , Salathiel could n't see it . Perhaps Herr Schmidt had temporarily abandoned the whip for the pen ? Nothing else about him , however , appeared to be clerical . He was pumpkin-shaped , with a broad rawhide belt for an equator , and colossal arms . He appeared to rest on a pediment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and then lowering his head and looking up again , it was hard to tell whether it was his moon-shaped visage or the fringed top of his bald head that comprisedhis countenance , so double-faced was the effect . Nor did it much matter , for both faces conveyed essentially the same vacant , brutal expression ; that of a malignant baby . Obviously , here was a bearlike specimen , one with whom verbal remonstrance would be labour lost . Surprise , terror , and threats were called for ; wrestling to be avoided . And it was along these lines that Salathiel decided to proceed . " Jed , " he said in a low tone , " will ye trust me ? " " Yas  --  yas , sah , " mumbled Jed , backing a little closer to the wall . P 269 " All right . Now take hold of yourself . I want ye to walk down there to the other end of the place , show yourself , and tell Schmidt your master sent you to git his horses . Be pert ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t'ing , Marse Albine ! " " Sure he will . But do n't let him collar ye . " " Jedu , no ! " " Run this way . Run back into the shadows . See ? Ye kin dive in and hide amongst the plunder  --  and then I 'll take care of Mr. Schmidt . Ye kin jist lead him on and leave him to me . " But still Jed hesitated . He was ashen-grey and sweating . " De whip , " he muttered . " Him cut dis feller clean in two . " " Not this time , " said Salathiel . " Try it , Jed ! Be a bold boy . " " Yas , sah , baas , I 's gwine . I 's gwine fer to go "  --  and with that Jed actually stepped out with a swagger , although his hands clutched convulsively in his sleeves , as he walked down the long room . He threaded the piles of materiel on tiptoe , until he came out into the lighted space and stood before the terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away he stopped . He stood there , but he was quite unable to say anything . Hans Schmidt was finishing his payroll . He was deducting small fines and collecting his rake-offs . And it was a full minute before he looked up . His piggish eyes rested incredulously on the shivering blanket-draped figure before him , and finally focused to a gimlet point of rage . He rose slowly , one hand still on the table . " Du kleiner schwarze Teufel du ! " he shouted . " Vas ! Haf I not tolt you I vil haf no black turds mixen mit mein good stable manure here ? Raus ! " Jed cleared his throat tremulously , " Baas-man say he want dem same six hawses now . And wid new hawness , " he added , with a certain impish twist of delight at his own inventive daring . " Du Lieber Himmel ! Zo ! Der vip haf nicht gelehrnet you . Vell , dis time I pop your gottam eyes out . " Schmidt came ponderously from behind the table , his thumbs twisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backed away slowly . The man followed . He seized a stool and dashed it at the Negro 's head . Jed dodged , and darted back into the shadows , running zigzag like a rabbit between the piles of plunder . He disappeared . Herr Schmidt followed breathing heavily , waddling alertly on his square toes with ponderous stealth . He knew he had his victim cornered . He hated niggers with an insane animal animosity , such as a gorilla might feel for a chimpanzee . His lips worked and hisP270eyes wrinkled his fat cheeks as he peered myopically into the shadowy gloom of the piled warehouse , trying to spot his dark fugitive .. . There he was !  --  just behind that great pile of tarpaulins . Blut and Tod ! Der verschreckende Hund . Now . His arms tensed , and he groped forward . And then his hands fell back to his sides . Something  --  something was curiously wrong , and yet vaguely and terrifyingly familiar . Even in the shadows and twenty feet away , he could see that Jed had turned into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ja ! The figure crouching before him was an Indian . He was leaning forward with an axe in his hand . Gott ! It was even more terrible than that . It was the worst thing that could possibly happen . It was the wild man from Bedford , who had killed men with a table . He had seen him . He was here ! Impos-sible  --  true ! The terrible man stood up ; towered . Schmidt 's breath sucked inward with the sound of an unprimed pump . The axe glinted . " Murder ! " The man was after him . " Wa-waw-wa . . . waw ! " The shivering scalp halloo of the Shawance rang iii Schmidt 's cars and unsocketed his soul . He was lunging like a bogged elk now . ' ncc door , the office door ! Lieber Jesu , the door ! he tripped over the stool he had thrown at Jed , crashed , and blundered on . Disemboweled ? Nein . Castrated ! I Ic rolled with the pain , but he rolled towards the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the yell burst out just behind him again . He surged forward , plunging . The man falling from the ceiling struck him down like a bag of grain . That fool had the advantage of him . He had started running while he was still in the air . The door opened . Whiff  --  the fellow was gone . The door closed . It banged in his very face . The bar fell down . But he crawled , he still crawled for it . And he was just reaching up to . . . when something whizzed , smacked  --  and he saw the axe standing in the wood , holding the bar iii place . Trapped ! Life was all  --  and he was so young yet . He caught his last breath , and puked a little . " Get up , Schmidty , " the voice said . " Get up , you big fat bowwow , so I can tell yer face from yer behind . " Oh , no , he would never do that . He would just stay on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would make the most of it . He startedP 271to crawl slowly on all fours towards his tormentor . The man was standing there with a scalping knife in his hand . So ! He 'd often wondered : to be bald and to be scalped . How would it be ? Ach , Gott ! He put his head down on the floor , with one hand patting his bald spot , his pudgy fingers spread out over it protectively , feeling the beautiful unspoiled smoothness of it . " Gnadiger Herr , " he murmured , " let your august eye-shine rest mercifully upon me , lieber gnadiger Herr . " " I 'll knot yer hair fer ye , good and right , if ye do n't get tip , " said Salathiel . " Get up ! " he roared . The double-faced effect seriously annoyed him . Schmidt got his hands on a table-top eventually , and after feeling it tentatively , managed with the assistance of his arms to rise and plant his fat fundament on a stool . He was still too shaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or resentment . Never , never under any conceivable circumstances would he ever , ever annoy the terrible man who now sat before him with his arms on the table , looking at him , grinning , with the big knife stuck uprightin the wood still teetering back and forth a bit on its point , vibrating with disappointment , as it were . " Look , Big Little-guts , " the man was saying , " you struck Mr. Arthur St. Clair 's servant with a whip this morning . Do you know who Mr. St. Clair is ? Do you want to spend the rest of your goddam life in the jailhouse ? " " Ja , " gasped Schmidt . " Ja wohl ! " Under the circumstances , so sheltered and permanent an existence as a whole lifetime in a safe prison , where thieves would not break in to steal nor Indians to scalp and slay  --  why , it was positively alluring . But horrors ! No  --  it had been the wrong answer . Himmel ! Of course not , if he 'd only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never again would he use the whip ; never again , without finding out first whose nigger it was . Now he 'd had his lesson . He 'd remember . And , oh , blessed thought , he was going to have time to remember . " And , " continued the man , " when I sent the coloured boy to fetch the horses this morning , the horses Mr. Stottelniyer lent me , and my own mare , you were going to whip him and keep the teams . And to think that I 'm still going to let you live ! " The wonder of this , the sheer gracious restraint of it , was too much for Herr Schmidt even to try to comment upon . He sat there in silent amazement . He trembled and he twitched , one great shaking jelly of abject gratitude .   Salathiel could stand it no longer . Some way or other he must return the quivering oaf before him to some semblance of a man . Already the whole place stank with the sour smell of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded . Unable to get the jug himself , Schmidt pointed it out . It was brought to him , and he drank . He gurgled . He set it down at last , and sat feeling the genial warmth course along his limbs ; watching the wavering grey outlines of the world gather themselves together . The pain in his groin was becoming bearable now . His hands stopped twitching of themselves . He could even think , a little .. . What could he do for his benefactor ? How could he best serve him ? He began to purr in a weak , relieved voice , while he rubbed the bruised spot under his belt  --  " ach "  --  that verdammte three-legged stool ! He listened ... ach , what kindness ! He would be permitted to ready the two teams that had been left with him . But immediately , and with new harness . He could groom and saddle the roan mare , tie a bag of oats on each wagon horse with three days ' rations , and look after the extra little gelding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was that understood ? Ja , all of it , down to the last buckle , precisely . But was n't there something else he could do ? Some special token of his everlasting personal regard ? Salathiel looked at him in amazement . Schmidt really meant it . He seemed scared into permanent gratitude for being left alive . Well , then , yes , there was something . Ile could give the whip , which he had dared to use on M r . St. ( lair 's servant , as a present . He could lay it very gently in the black boy 's hands . " Now , get up and get out , and give your orders . I 'll write a letter to Mr. Stottelmyer here while I 'm waiting , but I wo n't wait long . " No indeed . Bitte , it would be but a few moments , the mere swish of a mare 's tail . Only the pain in Schmidt 's groin prevented his bowing . He waddled stiffly to the door and shuffled through it . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began with a note of chastened authority to give his orders to the stable-boys in the yard . Only the whip , his marshal 's baton as chief wagoner , stuck in his craw . It was such a pee-u-tiful vip . A monstrous black bull 's pizzle with an elk-hide lash on it , a silver mounted handle and a wampum beaded thong . Aber , it would be best to deliver himself from temptation and give up the whip , for he , Hans Schmidt , was a terrible uncontrolled fellow , dangerous when he was enraged . He called a little more confidently now . Inside , Salathiel finished his note to Stottelmyer rapidly andP 273sanded it at Herr Schmidt 's table . When he looked up Jed was standing before him , just where he had been standing a few moments before . They grinned at each other , man to man . Jed put his hand respectfully over his mouth . His smile might perhaps be too wide at the discomfiture of a white man . " Now get out there , " said Salathiel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schmidty hands ye that whip , do n't ye be skeered . Crack it , and drive the four horses back to the wagon in the square . I 'm goin ' to ride Enna this morning myself . And do n't ye call me ' master ' any more . See ! " " Yas , sah , " replied Jed . He walked confidently to the door . Salathiel watched him . " That 's better , " he said . Lord , he was tired of all this slave business . It made cowards out of everybody , master and man . It was no good . If anybody was going to work for him , they 'd have to do it the way he had worked for Ecuyer . By God , if they did n't , he 'd murder them . Outside , he heard the yoke bells of the teams begin to chime gaily . A whip cracked . The teams departed . He walked out and mounted Enna . Schmidt was holding her , but said nothing . " Now keep on lookin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him no more liken ye did this morning , " said Salathiel . Suddenly , as an afterthought , he reached down and crushed the man 's hand in his own . Herr Schmidt stood looking after him and gazing at his puffing fingers . Even that man 's friendship was painful . Had he really meant what he said ? He thought so . He did n't dare to doubt it . Anyway , next time he would n't be so afraid of him , and he 'd sure let other people 's niggers alone . No more jokes that made the world turn upside down . The pee-u-ti ful vip was all  --  it was gone . Salathiel passed Jed at a gallop on the way back . He noted that Jed was managing the tough horse with the yellow eye . Also he was cracking the new whip . Experimentally , to be sure , but with a rapt look . As he cantered past the long sheds and loading yards of Boynton , Wharton &; Morgan , Salathiel rose in his stirrups and let the mare go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a fine clear day , frosty , but not a cloud in the sky . A perfect morning for finding anybody 's grandma . Now that he had the horses back again  --  five of them ! And it was only ten miles to Boiling Springs . P274The Mill on Yellow Breeches CreekTHE WAGON and the trundler , with the king 's arrow on it , fading so rapidly now under the action of time and weather , passed through the east gate of Fort Lowther without question and took the road for Boiling Springs . With good horses and Jed driving , a hard road , and only ten miles to go , Salathiel assumed that he might shortly arrive at Boiling Springs , following the directions given hint by his friend , Jim Fergus , the express rider , only a few hours before . At Boiling Springs he confidently expected to find Mr. Glen , the miller , and Bridget 's grandma , to wlionm the miller had so kindly given shelter . And , since Mr. Glen second to be such a hospitable man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to persuade him to give the rest of Bridget 's " fancily " at least temporary shelter at the mill . Anyway , that was his plan and hope for the immediate future ; and it seemed a reasonable one . He now felt more than ever limy important for many reasons it was to provide Frances with a decent and quiet place to settle down in , even if it were only for a short while . He 'd promised St. Clair to wait for at least two months over the business of the Ligonier settlers , and , whether any settlers showed up or not , St. Clair had retained him with hard money . He was bound to tarry until early spring . But meanwhile , he and Frances must live somewhere in the vicinity of Carlisle . That was the rub . For only one night and a few daylight hours in Carlisle had thoroughly convinced him that there was no lodging to be had in the town for love or money ; and that camping in the wagon in the public square , day after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be thought of . It would be an even greater P 275hardship than any they had encountered on the journey . Besides , it was high time now to put an end to haphazard wayfaring . What Frances Melissa needed now , with her child coming on , was  --  well , it was the shining little house he had promised her and that they had both dreamed about . They needed only a modest roof , but a warm hearth , and privacy  --  some place in which to try the great experiment of living together . What forest wanderers and cave dwellers they had been ! No , the next place , whatever it was , would have to be home . Frances would inevitably consider it so , with a woman 's sense of reality , and judge him as her provider accordingly . That was why he was so anxious about settling down now . He remembered the many small household articles and the cloth she had bought at Somerfield 's iii anticipation , five pounds ' worth ! He recalledher longing for pretty things ; how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stitching , embroidering , knitting . It would not do to put off too long the hope that all this implied ; it would be worse to disappoint it . The latter might be fatal . It would be like . . . oh , it would be like stopping a young dog from burying a bone by taking it away from him . A pup seldom went back to boneburyingagain , if he was balked . It prevented the natural habit , he supposed . When a young dog was sagacious , he gave it up . Maybe young women were like that ? Not squaws , of course . But Frances Melissa was no squaw just to do as she was told or to follow him about anywhere . He 'd better not keep on disappointing her . And so he was now fondly anticipating their arrival at Boiling Springs , and having Mr. Glen take them in . What could be better than that ? He could picture it all now . His and Frances ' kindness to Bridget would receive its just reward for bringing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Jim Fergus had said . Mr. Glen would be gratified at finding Bridget 's family to be such respectable people  --  Frances in a new bonnet , and all . So they could all settle down for a while together . Anything , a room or two in the mill loft , an old shed  --  oh , he 'd fix it up ! He 'd make himself invaluable to Mr. Glen . . . If not , he must go back to Shippensburg and hire Rutherford to take them in at old Fort Morris . That might do , but it would not be like Boiling Springs with Bridget 's grandma . Boiling Springs was the place . He just knew it . Ile could n't bear to think of giving Bridget up . No , Boiling Springs was it ! It just had to be . " Get along , Enna ! " He touched the mare with his heels and beckoned to Jed confidently . Certainly he could n't expect Melissa to settle down in a hole in the ground like these refugees , the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamentable huts and shebangs all about him . P278Carlisle to the DeTroit . And the fort , the town , and the extensive camps and " deposits " in the country around were vibrantly and hopefully alive . It had not always been like that , however . Again and again , Carlisle and its entire vicinity had swarmed and thronged ; positively undulated with the high tides of desperate military efforts and the reflex ebullitions of civil despair , during numerous expeditions and defeats . Now the place was in a preliminaryspasm of readjustment and rejoicing , a hectic period of bitter regrets and fond anticipations that so often follows closely the end of a long and only finally successful war . Bouquet 's great and unexpected victory at Bushy Run of the year before and his final subduing of the tribes on the distant Muskingum were an inexpressible relief to the long-suffering inhabitants at the base of operations . The intoxication of victory was , to them , somethingnew . For ten years past there had been few extremities of terror and misery which the patient but determined permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the midst of continual flux and counterflux they had persisted admirably . Some of them indeed had attained , even at the very centre of lamentation and confusion , to a certain degree of affluence and the sordid reputation of being able to wring excess profits from the clammy hands of Defeat herself . But this canny trait was undoubtedly more grumbled about than the facts warranted . The majority of honest folk and hard-working artisans of the place  --  if a contemporary military chronicler of their virtues is to be believed  --  were sustained iii their hope of a peaceful future by a prophetic quality of stillness iii the countryside , one that needed only a brief piping time of peace to dance with fertility  --  we are assured  --  and " by those Monuments of Eternity itself , the Blue Mountains of the western distances , " which , according to the local bard , " contemplated , over the shoulders of the horizon , with a constant equanimity , the modest navel in the belly of the forest that constituted Carlisle . " That , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way for respectable Monuments of Antiquity to carry on . Yet that , and nothing less than that , according to the rhymed and faintly amorous diary of Lieutenant Eustace Pomeroy of the Pennsylvania Light Infantry , was what he caught the mountains about Carlisle doing on the morning of November 8 , 1764  --  and the evidence of a light infantryman is not necessarily lightly to be set aside . His verisimilitudemay , in all conscience , have been less irregular than his verse or the manoeuvres of the quite irregular unit in which he served.  |p279But  conceding that Lieutenant Pomeroy of the Light Infantry must have had his contemporary moments , then it is all the more the pity that he did not keep his eyes about him in regard to the conduct of the rivers as well as of the mountains near Carlisle . The lieutenant , it seems , was much given to feeding his diarial muse with small scraps of geographical erotica ; and yet not a crumb of scandal as to what the Yellow Breeches might have been doing with the Conodoguinitabout the same date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet , undoubtedly , here was a spritely confidence ready for his diary that our military poet missed . For the rivers about Carlisle are as provocative as the mountains , and both the Yellow Breeches and the Conodoguinit are fast little streams . They play around with each other a good deal without ever quite deciding to come together , kept apart perhaps by a prudish lie of the land . And yet they take every opportunity to fall . Now , surely here was a pastoral situation , just the kind of prankish aquatic flirtation going on in the landscape before him , which the classical pen of a Pomeroy might then have so fashionably limned . But not a whisper of all this got set down in our poet 's couplets , not even an innocent aside in his commonplace-book . Perhaps the lieutenant was promoted  --  many a martial song bird has thus been inadvertently translated to higher things . Or he was evacuated too soon  --  inspiration is so often like that . At any rate , only the mountains , those blue mementoes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November the 8th , got told on . For more prosaic yet equally pungent news about the rivers in the vicinity of Carlisle , we must turn elsewhere : Very early says an old historian the country about Carlisle and LeTort 's Springs was penetrated by unauthorizedbut observant and self-seeking persons . Unknown to the Proprietary , and careless of any interest but their own , they soon pre-empted most of the more desirable mill sites along the Yellow Breeches and the Conodoguinit branches and disposed of the Indian families , hitherto resident in the vicinity , by methods more salutary than those originally advocatedby William Penn . Once in firm possession , they flourished both by diligenceand ingenuity . The hitherto friendly and sportive little rivers found the virgin transports of their headlong currents restrained . And the wild nymphs of the heady springs of the district were soon , for the most part , tamely fully , they kept their two young German redemptioners fast locked up at night in the mill . It was lonely and dangerous , but as far as living went  --  more than usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own work to do . Prophecies and bets as to their approaching end had not been spared them . But their eventual reward for this " piece of foolhardy bravado " , as their quondam neighbours had called it , was to be given a contract to grind flour for the garrison by Colonel Bouquet , and to possess their house and mill in peace and quietude . For they never saw any Indians whatever , except for poor old Doctor Scarlet and his sorry Delaware family , who settled down on the banks of Yellow Breeches Creek near-by to gather ginseng , sing Moravian hymns at twilight , and beg a little corn meal from the mill every Sunday for " the love of God alone " . The wrinkled old " chief " , the escort with a covered wagon from the camp , when a run of the mill was necessary for the garrison  --  these were all the people and only signs of human life the Glens saw for many a long day . It was only an hour 's easy ride to Carlisle , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deathly silence that had fallen upon it , they might as well have been on a bayou of the lower Mississippi . Nevertheless , they made the best of it . They worked hard , kept watch , and stood their ground . Thus primeval peace returned to the small hole-in-the-woods by the ford on Yellow Breeches Creek in the midst of war . The Boiling Springs branch rolled musically over the mill-dam , the blind buildings clustering about the mill grew green moss on their shingles , the wary deer once more ventured out of the forest to drink shyly at the deserted ford . It was towards the end of t h i s epoch t of undeclared peace , during the early autumn of ' 64 , when the news from the west was so reassuringand glorious , that John departed to have new iron-work fabricatedat Conestoga , and , although he slid not say so , to woo him a wife . Martin , the other son , was at that time on the banks of the Muskingum . So , Manoah Glen was now left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay young wife . She , in the perfect silence of the deserted village , broken only by occasional wild snatches of belated bird song , seemed to the aging widower to be invisibly present , like remembered music , in the lonely rooms of his long empty house . He had a growing subliminal impression that she was there . Yet there was nothing disturbing about her unapparent return . In the evening , especially , she simply seemed to be near him again . And from this feeling of her quiet presence hep283derived merely a familiar comfort and a sense of sweet companionshiprenewed . Only an unusually plangent note from the falling water of the mill-dam caused him to glance curiously , if not expectantly , into the corner at her dusty harp . Otherwise , the pleasing monotony of his daily tasks engulfed him . His sons , of course , would come back shortly . That was the understanding . Their father was simply to hold the fort a while longer , until they , and more prosperous times , might return together . And this he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redemptioners . They were not exactly good company , but they did help him about the mill . They also milked a few of the neighbours ' abandoned cows that came wandering in , they cooked after a fashion , tended the two wagon horses , loafed , and grumbled together in guttural tones . That was the serene and quiet status of affairs for some time at boiling Springs , one that suited the mud swallows particularly well . For the mill had remained quiet so long that it finally fooled them . And they began to build nests in the drying blades of its motionless wheel . But as the clays of Indian summer commenced to wane , and there was no harvest with new wheat to grind , Mr. Glen began to be weary of himself ; of the constant sound of falling water , and the grave memories of his shadowy wife . He needed certain supplies , snuff in particular , and above all he longed for a word with his vanished neighbours and news of the doubtful progress of the war . And that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he hitched up the big blue mill wagon and , taking both the bound boys with him , set out for Carlisle . P284Manoah Glen Drives Over to CarlisleIT WAS A SCARLET and golden day . The tree-lined road wound through a canyon of blazing autumn colours , and the leaves drifted down singly from half-denuded branches , seeming to coast along the yellow shafts of sunlight that illuminated the forest floor . A few crows cawed through the echoing woodlands . There was no breeze , and it was quite warm . Mr. Glen drove leisurely . Karl and Johann , the two German boys , sat looking backward over the tail-gate behind , one of them playing a jew's-harp . Its monotonous melodic thrumming conveyed perfectly the sense of subdued contentment and mild lyric satisfaction that they all felt at going to town in such glorious fall weather . At a ford over a small stream a couple of miles from the mill , Mr. Glen had Karl lead the team over the water . It was a nasty place . There was an abrupt gravel bank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bark from a giant sycamore that stood on the south side of the ford . Horses reared up and carried on here . One of the flour wagons from the fort had been overturned and lay , wheels up , but bogged down in the water . Mr. Glen did n't know it , but it was only when horses were coming towards the mill that they reared up and carried on . He took no chances , however . The place bore a sinister reputation . Several farmers he knew had been thrown and injured . So he had Karl lead the team over the water , with a firm hand on the bridles . Both Karl and his companion , Johann Krautze , agreed with Mr. Glen . They knew for certain the little ford in the forest was " hexed " . Even the English knew that . Jenny Greentooth , the wrinkled old barmaid , who used to live at the ordinary at Boiling Springs , hadtold them so . And she was an old wise-woman with an evil cross-eyedP285squint . The south bank of the stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the thunder-smitten tree  --  and the smallest chip was an omen of bad luck that could sour cream or curdle a strong man 's blood . The jew's-harp stopped twanging , and both boys shivered as they crossed the leaping water . As they drove on clown the road , Johann , looking out of the rear of the wagon , suddenly saw what it was that made horses go crazy . And no wonder ! It was the great sprawling lightning blaze on the bark of the thunder-tree . It looked , in the shadows and sunlight shimmering through the trees  --  it looked like a ferocious white monster ; a griffin ; a ghastly hell cat ? Du lieber Gott , it was an unholy vampire about to pounce ! Johann pointed it out to Karl , as they sat tight-lipped and silent together . The devil had left the mark of evil at the ford . Ten minutes later they abruptly emerged from the wall of the forest and looked out across a haze of yellow dust that covered the cleared meadows , to the distant jagged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LeTort 's Springs , was a large military camp . White-topped wagons crawled across the vista along the streaks of dusty roads . Smoke from many fires curled leisurely upward . Over the distant town hung a dusty haze of activity . Lord , it was good to be out of the woods and into the cleared fields again ! The German boys started to sing shyly , the jew's-harp twanged away again , and Mr. Glen smiled . It was between three and four miles from the place where they had emerged from the woods to the outskirts of Carlisle . As Mr. Glen drove slowly along over the red-clay road , with the hovels and thatched " miseries " of refugees growing ever more numerous in the fields on either side , the miller felt inclined to congratulate himself that he had had both the bowels and the good sense to remain living at the mill . He had not been to town for nearly a year now , and the sight of such pitiful crowding , the squalor and slovenly confusion , was shockingly unexpected and profoundly disturbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of existence his father had left London to avoid ! As he drove on , his impression of unease gradually grew in intensity . Eventually it confounded him with surprise and a certain unexpected indignation . After his undisturbed sojourn in the quiet mill house by the ford , rude noises , so many blatant people , and the numerous wagons converging on the town ( lazed him . At LeTort 's Springs , a mile or two outside of Carlisle , the first complete sample of what the town itself might be like burst upon him .   pleasant green ran the old road to LeTort Springs , now used only for an exit . In the course of time the whole entrenched approach before the east face of the fort had gradually taken on the aspect of a small park . Marked by the regular lines of the old entrenchments , it presented an artificial , sequestered , and formal aspect . Here it was that the better and the more select , certainly the more pretentious people and personages of the town and garrison came to promenade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening , after the heat of the day  --  and in the autumn in the morning , before the hour of the midday meal . Winnowed out by the guard at the gate according to the understoodcustoms of the time and place , and by the strict standing orders of the commandant , not everybody might breathe the air in the " Artillery Walk " ; only those who dressed well and were socially entitled to escape from the unclassified rout and common mingling in the public square at the opposite side of the fort were admitted to the lawny precincts of the king 's artillery garden . Under the twinkling bayonets of the royal sentries high on the stockade platform , here in this green forum of adjudicated rank  --  gentility , wealth and distinction , sensibility and fashion itself , made a point of daily renewing its cherished conviction that elegance existed even at Carlisle , and of proving it . Now , it was about eleven o'clock that moaning when Mr. Glen was held up by the bears . The entrance to High Street was along the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look right over the crest of the old entrenchment into the artillery garden . Possibly two score couples , and hail f as many beaux and bachelors , were walking up and clown . Several clergymen in decent black and even a few Joseph-coated macaronis were present . The royal officers from the garrison with their wives ; foreign officers from the Royal Americans with their housekeepers and mistresses ; officers of the Pennsylvania line and their ladies of various degrees ; rich and well-dressed merchants , a few trim-suited Quakers among them ; some of the local landholders and gentry , three or four magistrates , and five or six well-known lawyers , all with their well-gowned ladies in hoops and bustles , shawls , reticules , kerchiefs , and big hats  --  strolled up and down , turned , stopped , bowed , curtsied , removed hats while white wigs shone , exchanged snuff , gossiped , and pleasantried with an air of gay decorum . Someone , Mr. Glen could not see who , had brought a sedan chair from Philadelphia . It was carried by four Negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a neat pyramid of piled round-shot not far from the sallyport . There was a couple seated in it  --  some great oneyers  --  possibly one of the governor 's council , anP 289Indian commissioner with his lady , or a great city merchant and his dame . At any rate , the chair was the cynosure of genteel attention , and its occupants were , in effect , holding court . There was an obsequious crowd that continually changed about the sedan chair . Everyone who came out of the gate hastened to approach it , bowed , was introduced ; bowed again , and passed on . The commandant and his wife stood next to it , talking . A thin young man , in bottle-green pantaloons , high-heeled red shoes , puce-coloured satin coat , laced-in until he somehow resembled a frog , hopped about in attendance , with the most minuscule of all three-cornered hats under his left arm . A large Chinese fan , his own or the lady 's in the chair , continually fluttered in his right hand . It was he who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal introductions . The other macaronis present merely basked in his reflected sunshine . But they also chattered , twirled infinitely slender Malacca canes , looked at their eyebrows and patches in small handglasses , and flew about gallanting everybody , like so many male midges dancing in a cloud of perfumed snuff . It was this dainty group about the chair that especially attracted attention . It seemed wonderful that with the rough log stockade for a background it could dare to exist . But there it was  --  gay , fragile , and very much alive . To Mr. Glen , at least , the fashionable agitation about the sedan chair , the chatter and goings-on of the several couples in the park , were of much greater interest and respectable concern than the rude shuffling of the two adolescent bears and the coarse shouts of their savage keeper . In fact , from where he sat , he could no longer see the bears over the tops of the other wagons now wedged in so hopelesslyat the street corner . Also , he had no doubt but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ursine blockade . Meanwhile , the human bear garden in the park was undoubtedly more instructive , even if somewhat disconcerting , for he found that he himself recognized many of the people who were putting on the select show on the green . With several he did business , and with others he was friends . It was the size of the rout and the presence of so many strangers , not all fashionable ones , that surprised him and gave him a hint of what a sad levelling of barriers was going on in the town itself . Indeed , to his old-fashioned and certainly conservative notions , there were quite a few promenading that morning who , to his mind , had small reason for being admitted to the walk at all  --  and this applied more specifically , he thought , to many of the females . Certainly the taste of the royal staff officers was flamboyant , and the dress of their female companions , exotic . Rouge , ribbons , and feathers ! Maybe that was the way fine ladies in the colonies dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and doxies who ... Well , it reminded him . And some of the females with the Pennsylvaniaprovincials were obviously not of the best provincial families . As for the many bachelors in mercantile rigs , doubtless they were minor merchants , the jobbers , contractors , ambitious clerking catchpennies and leeches which the hope of army business had brought to Carlisle . They must indeed have come from " all over " . Northern broadcloth mixed with the nankeen of southerners . There was a medley of high boots and plain buckled shoes . Some of the young men in straw hats , without wigs , looked to be scarcely more than aspiring artisans ! Mr. Glen sniffed . There was even a Frenchmanthere , a Creole , he thought . And he was gay as anybody . Good Lord ! He sat looking at them , not altogether approvingly . As time passed , he sniffed several times . Other people in other wagons , however , who also were being forced to observe the antics of their betters , were not confining themselves to quiet sniffs . The German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the macaronis , shouted obscene observations , and insolently roared . These evidences of contempt and disapprovalfrom beyond the slopes of Parnassus , as it were , were at first disregarded by the nymphs and demigods of the Artillery Walk . Or they affected to suppose it was all directed towards the dancing bears . But the din at last became so considerable , so pointed and prolonged , that the Olympians themselves about the sedan chair were finally touched to the quick . The annoyed gestures o f a gold-headed cane and a doeskin glove from the chair itself brought a sergeant of dragoons on the double from the gate . Mr. Glen now watched the proceedings about the chair with renewed interest . One of the smallest of the gentlemen 's extremely small hats was passed rapidly from hand to hand , the doeskin glove itself contributing . The sergeant , then , in his extremely neat black gaiters , strode off , jiggling the little hat , in the direction of the man with the dancing bears . An expectant and grateful silence instantly accompanied him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were going to be of some use after all . The ho ho humphing at the street corner suddenly ceased . " ' Ere , " said the sergeant , looking down from the top of the old breastworks at the red-faced man and the tired tongue-lolling bears just beneath him , " ' ere 's a ' ole bloody ' atful o ' swag for you and your un'oly libours . A ' ole bleeding ' atful ! " He held up the Lilliputianheadpiece for all to see. p 291The bear-master put his thumb to his nose , but removed it immediately as the sergeant extracted a new shilling from the hat as a fine for the gesture . " An ' if hi was you , me bahr-biten friend , " he continued , " I 'd tike them two ' airy pupils back to the kive of their hawncesters and crawl in after ' em . For Gineral Buckey , ee 'll be back hany di now , and ' e ' ites biby bahrs and halligitors and all sich pets like bloody ' ell . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poured the remaining pennies , pistareens , and picayunes into the bear-master 's eager hands . What the sergeant had said  --  the news of Buckey 's return  --  flashed down the line of waiting wagons like lightning . Men now handled their reins impatiently again . The bear-master dragged his cubs across the street into a bricked alley , and the pent-up flood of vehicles , suddenly released , streamed headlong , bumping and clatteringover the cobbles along the stockaded street amid a torrent of oaths , volleys of whip-cracking , and an infernal squalling of brakes that almost stopped Mr. Glen 's old heart . From doorways and upper windows , women screamed frantically to their muddy brats to get out of the gutter , as the whole medley of clanking wagons and scared farmers on rickety high-wheeled carts hurtled forward , and gushed out into the open square . Two minutes later the good miller , feeling faint and overcome , and with every thought of gentility swept out of his head , sat wiping the sweat of apprehension from his kindly old face , while he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie up his team . Every place seemed to be taken . Finally , he snagged onto a hitching post near the west gate of the stockade which seemed to be providentially vacated , and after resting awhile to settle a bit of nauseous vertigo , he stood up in the wagon to look about him : Godamighty ! What was the old town coming to ? Whatever could the authoritiesbe athinking of ? The place had sure got away from them ; the common people had broken loose . Look at it  --  just look at them ! Or , for that matter , listen ! The square seethed in blatant sound . Mr. Glen felt dizzy again , and had to sit down for a moment . " London bridge is falling down  --  falling down , " sang a shrillvoicedyoung slattern , tripping homeward , with a wooden pailful of beer that slopped over and foamed on her bare feet . She rolled her eyes up at the fat German boys in the wagon and gave the two girls an unpleasant wink , one that managed to cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by , with a twitch of one muscle in her eyelid . All the young people seemed to be in a conspiracy against him , he felt . Somehow or other the girl with the beer contrived to show a dirty chapped leg almost up to her  --  neck ! Mr. Glen turned away feeling his nausea renewed . It was so safe and private at Boiling Springs . The old mill house there had his wife 's furniture , her bed made up under a tester  --  just as she had left it seven years before  --  and outside there was the whisper of trees and the music of clear running water  --  oh , to be at home again ! He wished the two young hussies in the wagon would find their uncles . Maybe he 'd been a bit too kind . Anyway , they still sat in the wagon buck-toothed and dirty-faced , simpering at his two bound boys . What could he do with them ? He felt too faint to try to make them leave . And the boys , damn them ! For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . The weather was so much hotter than he had expected . It was hard at his age for a widower to put up with all this . But pshawhehad errands to do . He could find shelter overnight with some of his friends . He stood up again , looking across the stir and confusion to see how he could pick his way , and what to do next . Godamighty ! Over the familiar roofs of the houses on the opposite side of the square , far far away in the blue distance , the rounded tops of the leaping mountains seemed to he peeping down into the town , observing , perhaps , the navel of the public square . Mr. Glen 's view of the scene , while not so exalted , was even more intimate , and the effect upon the quiet and orderly mind of the bucolic old widower was disturbing to the last degree . In fact , the surprising concatenation of sights and sounds threatened to overwhelm hint . He stood upright again on the wagon scat , but his legs were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a noise was going on . For a minute he could hardly think without closing his eyes . Wheels rumbled like the sound of a constant ground swell before a storm ; this ground-shaking thunder of heavy wagons ceaselessly rolling underlay all else . A welter and babble of talk , loud , offensive and insistent , reverberated from every part of the square . English , Scotch , Irish , German , Dutch , and the harsh Palatinate dialects  --  Welsh , Flemish , and even a bit o f Drench relentlessly collided and were mutually misunderstood , until people took to shouting at each other furiously in bad English . Yet it was quite plain that this din , to so many frontier people tired of the grim silence of the forest ; and the rich confusion , to numerous vagrants from the eastern seaboard , sick of rigid customs , restraint , and orderly dullness  --  were equally delicious . At any rate , the square sounded delirious . It frolicked as though at the height of a carnival and seemed to be inp 293love with its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with a fearless , unrepentant , devil-may-care air . From the open windows of boarding-houses and numerous ordinaries came the fused noise of revelry within ; voices and the sound of various instruments blended . Fiddles squeaked and curious folk-contrivances of distant European origin and vintage wailed , squalled , and sweetly twanged . Zithers seemed to echo a bell-like melody from steeples in the Valley of Forgotten Dreams . Liquor flowed . Outside the taverns , people danced and sang , while others wept and prayed . No one paid attention to either , and noisy business swept about them all . At the fort drums were beaten and bugles blew from time to time , speaking out clearly from another country beyond the stockade walls as though military order might suddenly debouch from the gate and impose itself forcibly . But so subtle a threat went unheeded . The square rollicked on , happy in its new-found sense of freedom . Nothing quite like it , and on such a scale , had been seen in the colonies before . It was the aftermath of a long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and relief at emerging from the dangerous past . America was assembled , discovering itself , and enjoying it . Something new was being born , and was making a natal noise . Anarchy was in the air . The excuse for the occasion was morally satisfying and exciting . Everybody , in his own opinion , had come to Carlisle to help release the Indian captives , to do a good deed ( as profitably as possible ) ; and , incidentally , to celebrate the victorious return of Brigadier Bouquet . At the moment the square itself was a condominium of everythingcivil and military . It was a park for ordnance and surplus supplies . Mounted brass cannon and caissons , the heavier guns , that Bouquet had not been able to take with him , and which were not needed now at the frontier forts , since the French had gone , were disposed in reserved plots under guard . There were also piles of solid shot , shells , and new-cast carcasses , spare wagon wheels and axletreesready for transport , the product of the new factories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiarly crowded moment , at the dizzy height of activity for the day . Two divisions of empty wagons on their way back to Lancaster and Philadelphia and a newly laden convoy bound for Fort Pitt were trying to leave and cross the square at the same time . The place was therefore a maze of slowly moving wagon-tops edging outward , while the right-of-way was being vigorouslydisputed with German profanity and blacksnake whips . The dust and din were prodigious . P294A thief was being drummed out of camp by the garrison , and Mr. Glen was forced to get one of the boys to hold the horses , while to the shrill accompaniment of the rogue 's march , the culprit , his guard , and the jeering crowd accompanying them emerged from the west portal of Fort Lowther and swept past . Evidently neither courtsmartialnor the civil magistrates were idle . In the stocks by the jail a couple of wretches with bleeding backs and blood-caked ears sat groaning and enduring as best they might showers of filth hurled by a swarm of ragged youngsters tormenting them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the very shadow of sedate houses , booths and dilapidated marquees had been erected by the numerous quacks , raree showmen , and sellers of sovereign elixirs and " celebrated " nostrums . Here too were barberchirurgeonswith their bowls , a puppet show , card-fortuners , and sundry drawers of teeth . They were all prepared to decamp instantly . Meanwhile , they shouted , rang bells , and pattered a continuous litany of their own applause . Hard cider , apples , and doughnuts were being sold by ruddyfacedGermans from high-wheeled carts . Hawkers of tobacco , ginger confections , and pretzels ; pedlars and tinkers with pewter plates and copper pans ; a man with wooden Yankee clocks on his back and a tray of small cutlery and ribbons ; all wandered noisily and at will . Free Negroes sang and chanted the merits of hot pepper-pot and fried catfish . A wagon from Baltiniore was selling oysters , three a ha'penny , while it dripped stale sea water , and stank . Bargelike German wagons from Lancaster , painted with sprays of yellow flowers , covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wives and children , sold scrubbed vegetables , poultry , eggs , cheese , and butter from big brown crocks . These vehicles were strung with links of sausage and displayed loaves of rye bread covered with anise seeds , meat pies , and kitchen . There was a long line of these vending carts at the north end of the square , where a temporary free market had been arranged by the authorities , and everybody , from commissioners to officers ' servants , came to haggle . Prices were almost as high as the piles of green refuse that released captives , dressed in shabby remnants of Indian finery , constantly picked over for a bit of cabbage stalk , a beet root , or a sprouted potato to make soup . Under the shadow of the stockade , and as close to the guard by the fort gate as he could get , one Jacob Mois , a Sephardic Jew money-changer , come all the way from South Carolina , had erected his booth out of empty ammunition crates . He plied a busy trade in the worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and with such a variety of minor coins of foreign origin as only his delicate scales and the professional acumen in the tips of his fingers could evaluate . Jacob would also write letters , if time permitted , and his olive-faced , brown-eyed daughter Rachel would consent to help . All this , decidedly , was not the kind of world Mr. Glen had expectedor hoped to live to see . The possibility of personal refuge and decent privacy seemed , to have vanished from it . Rationally or not , he felt surprised , dispirited , cheated of his just expectations , and duly indignant . There were too many people here  --  too many kinds of people , and all free , unrestrained , absolutely on their own . What could have happened ? What was going on ? Unconsciously , the scene itself forced these questions upon him . For the moment he was stopped . He could only stand and watch . His sons were away , and how was he going to deal with so many people , and so many people of different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glen , as though only God were left to appeal to .. . Well , he would have to leave the wagon where it was and pick his way across the square to Mr. Williams 's house on the west walk . There he could at least sit on the porch for a while and recollect himself . He had forgotten exactly what it was he had come to town to do . And he would have to pick his way across to the porch carefully . Lord , he hoped the Williamses would be at home . He climbed down slowly by the wheel spokes and told Johann to take charge of the wagon and to wait . He did n't have the energy to get rid of the two girls . It might mean a row and their impudence . He turned  --  and dizzy with a buzzing confusion , began to grope across the square towards the other side . It was not easy . It was about the time when most people , not gentry , were going home for the midday meal . Artisans in leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fort gate . Officers and non-coms attached to the garrison , militia and regulars , in bright uniforms of bewildering variety , made hastily for their various quarters and ordinaries , and would not stop to be polite . Washerwomen and matrons officially attached to the barracks , who wore blue aprons and half-leather clogs , sporting the buttons of various regiments as ornaments and personal testimonials of their various professional abilities and female accomplishments , clattered back and forth between the banks of Bonny Creek , where their washingwas done , and the quarters and barracks , with bundles and baskets of clothes . They made way for no one and had savage tongues . A smoothing-shed for the officers ' linen just to the left inside the fort gate , provided with a half dozen sad-irons and a charcoal stove , was the cause of constant bickering amongst the washerwomen and the scene of frequent hair-pulling encounters over precedence in the waiting-line . Somehow Mr. Glen became involved with these viragoes and was bumped down the line . He emerged into a crowd of hawkers of pies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a Negro 's hay cart . He was aware now that something terrible had happened to him , that he was ill on the inside of his head . But he struggled on . The sky over the roof-line on the opposite side of the square had unaccountablyturned inky black . Underneath , the houses grinned at him like a line of bared white teeth . And yet , there , infinitely remote now , was the sure refuge of Mr. Williams 's porch . He could still see it . He blundered on , his feet unaccountably heavy , while he seemed to be burning up . White children chased scared pickaninnies back to the refuge of their masters ' yards . Coloured house servants of prosperous families , in bright turbans , proud of their masters ' colours , elbowed aside the miserably dressed and forlorn redemptioners , whom they despised . Pedlars , townsmen , a gang of chained prisoners under guard , hurryingshopkeepers , and leisurely merchants all flowed past him . A loose colt got in his way . " Godantighty ! . , A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of houses just ahead . IIe walked forward blindly . Somehow , somehow or other , he found himself at last staggering up the three white steps onto the Williamses ' front porch . I is sat down , the flies dimly bothering him ... He was sitting in a big chair fanning himself with his hat , and Mrs. Williams was fussing over hint and exclaiming . She gave him a good strong drink . Lord ! That was a relief ! He felt better almost immediately . The world cleared . Ile could fan himself and enjoy now the cool breeze he made that way . It was splendid to be among friends  --  and the Williamses were always so kind . Old-time neighbours . He must n't move , Mrs. Williams said . I le must just sit and make himself comfortable . No one had ever seen such hot weather , and November just around the corner . Good lack ! It certainly was hard on old people , and he 'd better sit still and cool off . Of course , he could stay overnight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She sent a young coloured girl with her baby out to watch him , while she went in to air out the side bed-chamber herself . Mr. Glen , the coloured girl , and the baby , who was sucking its thumb , all sat on the front porch and stared at one another . He didp 297feel better now , more at ease , strangely relaxed . He felt amiable once more .. . Presently an old friend , someone he had n't seen for years , came up on the porch and sat with him . It all seemed so perfectly natural . Campion Honeywell  --  he was down on a visit from Boston town , winding up the matter of a contract for army candles with the quartermasterat Carlisle . And a good thing , too . Campion Honeywell was as direct and incisive in his talk as he had always been . You would scarcely think that they had n't seen each other for eight years . Why , Campion did n't even know that Mrs. Glen had died . And he 'd known Marie so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the talking ; he managed to convey that he was pretty well off , and both his daughters had married well . Mr. Glen began to complain a little languidly of his widower 's loneliness at the mill . The boys were away  --  and all that . But he did n't feel like talking very much . But Mr. Honeywell 's face lighted with sudden interest . Maybe he could help make things less lonely at the mill , he said . He 'd brought a townswoman of his along with him from Boston , it appeared . A competent old lady , poor , but she 'd sold her house to get to Carlisle to try to find her captivated grand-daughter . And , in a way , Mr. Honeywell was interested . He 'd provided her a passage down , and more important , he 'd found her a place in Carlisle for a few days . But he was going back to Boston tomorrow , and he was worried about Mrs. Larned  --  Mrs. Theodosia Lamed  --  a nice old party , well connected in Boston . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he left ? Could Mr. Glen take her in ? Why would n't it be a good idea for him to take her back to the mill with him and let her be housekeeper there , while she was waiting for her grand-daughter  --  and the Glen boys were away . Mrs. Larned was respectable . She would like to earn her keep . Why not ? Mr. Glen thought it over . Not very clearly , to he sure  --  but carefully . He could see no serious objections and several advantages . And Honeywell was quietly insistent . He had a brisk Yankee way with him when there was something he wanted to get done . Mr. Glen was still a bit faint . But , why not ? Still , he would like to see Mrs. Larned and talk to her first . He could n't introduce just anybody into his dead wife 's cherished house . Naturally , of course not ! But Mrs. Larned was staying only four houses away down the street . Mr. Honeywell would go and fetch her . It would be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left fanning himself again , while the baby sucked its thumb , seated on the floor before him . The coloured girl had beenP298called in to help Mrs. Williams ready the bed-chamber . No one , least of all Mr. Honeywell , had any idea that the last pinch of sand in the bottleneck of Mr. Glen 's hourglass was running out . Presently , Mr. Honeywell was back again with Mrs. Larned . He also brought Jim Fergus along . Fergus had just delivered Mrs. Larned a letter from Fort Lyttleton , and Mrs. Larned held it in her hand , trembling , almost tearful , with joy . Her face shone with inwarddelight . Everybody was pleased . It seemed providential that the old lady 's grand-daughter had been preserved and that she might soon hold her in her arms . Mr. Glen became now simply a third party to aid Providence . He liked the old lady . He was even touched by her justified faith and preternatural neatness . While Jim Fergus sat on the steps , and despite Mr. Glen 's feeling of exhaustion , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking Mrs. Larned home to Boiling Springs . It was all quite simple . He explained he had had a touch of heat and would have to stay the night at Carlisle . But if Jim would find the wagon , " hitched nigh to the fort gate across the square " , the German boys could get Mrs. Lamed 's luggage and drive her back to the mill with them that evening . They would have to come hack for him with the wagon next ( lay . But after a night 's rest , he would be feeling much better , he thought and he could get all his errands done next morning . Meanwhile , Mrs. Larned could be making herself at home . The German boys would show her about the will house and tell her where the house keys hung . She might . keep a little eye on them . Would she ? Mr. Glen smiled . The two old people nodded to each other . He liked the way she brushed her bright silver hair back from her forehead . Their understanding was peacefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tell them ? " Why , sartin , " Jim smiled ; and said he 'd know now just where to direct the people who 'd bring Mrs. Larned 's grand-daughter to town . He 'd sure remember . " The mill , Glen 's mill at Boiling Springs . " Mr. Glen and Mrs. Larned shook hands . With a simple expression of deep gratitude , she departed to pack up the few belongings that she still cherished in this world  --  for Bridget . The wagon would doubtless call for her soon . Mr. Honeywell said he would see her off . For a few minutes Mr. Glen was left alone again with the brown baby . The excitement and emotions of the past few moments had been intense . He had admitted a stranger to his house . Too easily perhaps  --  but he was so tired of being alone . Alone , alone !  --  he sat pondering . The world seemed to be withdrawingto an indistinct distance . Alone ! Why , he 'd never felt sop 299completely alone as he did now ! He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserted vacuum , abandoned , left suddenly entirely to himself . It was hard to fill his lungs in this breathless silence . Lord , this was what he had worked all his life to prevent . To die all by himself , and not a soul to bend over him ! No one ! Where was Marie ? Where were the two boys ? Where was he ? Oh , the everlastingsilence ! All he could do was see now . The blood whispered in his ears . It made a noise like darkness coming on . He looked out into the light to the very last . The Negro baby squatted in a narrowing circle of sunshine before him . It was crying . Ile could see its face and mouth move . There were ants on its hands , and it was trying to lick them off . That was the way it was . Little things worrying a body . It was terrible , unbearable . Somebody must tell the baby . Why did n't its mother come ? He would call for her , cry out ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . Ile tried hard . The ants were still crawling . Let me out of here ! Let me go ! Jesus ! Enough .. . Godamighty .. . Mr. Glen 's tired face fell forward and rested on his quiet breast . P300The Sound of Flowing WaterTHE BLUE MILL WAGON and the German boys called for Mrs. Larned and her luggage , a horse-hide trunk and three pitiful bundles , about the same time that Mr. Glen was making his final observations on the irritating characteristics of ants . The two redemptioners , although outwardly respectful , were both inwardly quite sullen . For Jim Fergus , on finding them sparking in the wagon with the two girls in the public square , in a manner which he considered wanton , had withered the budding flower of a double romance with the black frost of his invective . I le spoke powerfully and directly . The girls decamped  --  and the wagon was at NI rs . Larned 's door almost before she could get the hairy lid of her scuffed portmanteau closed . Mr. Honeywell and Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair in the wagon for Mrs. Larned to sit on , with admonitions to the boys to return it promptly next morning when they called back for Mr. Glen . And after final instructions to Johann to stop upstreet at Mr. Williams 's and get his master 's last orders , they waved the old lady a cheerful good-bye and strolled across the square together for a pipe and a nip , with the fellow feeling of a good deed well done , and a charitable account edifyingly closed . Johann did exactly as he was told . He stopped at the Williamses ' door , and while Mrs. Larned and Karl sat waiting in the wagon , he went in to speak to his master , who appeared to be dozing on the front verandah . The baby had finished satisfactorily with the ants and was now quietly sucking its thumb again . But on approaching his master more closely , Johann stopped in his tracks . Something in Mr. Glen 's attitude told him that the good miller was not dozing , not dozing at all . P301This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not nervously betray himself . He stood stolidly pondering . He could not think quickly , but he was cunning . And it was quite plain , even to him , that here was an opportunity which , if properly utilized , might save him two years ' further service and cancel his articles profitably . He stood thinking over the situation carefully , item by item . Then he glanced at the wagon . They were just sitting there , waiting . Ja , py Gott , he would do it ! But he would have to be careful ; and what was even more difficult , be swift . Just to make sure , he bent over and spoke his master 's name . But there was no reply . The brown baby removed its thumb and looked up at him . Before it started to cry , then . He leaned down as i f be were carefully and respectfully listening to instructions from Mr. ( Glen , and detached his tasselled ring-purse that was wound twice about his leather belt . Then he backed away a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said quite loudly , " Ja wohl , sir , ve vill do it  --  ve coom back tomorrow . " Mrs. Larned was looking at him as he walked back , but he managed a bit of a swagger , as he climbed onto the wagon . Probably she had heard what he had said . He hoped so . He had never flinched , not even with the dead man behind him . He just climbed up on the seat with Karl and began talking to him softly in voluble German . The wagon rattled off rapidly in the direction of Boiling Springs , and Mrs. Larned with her bundles gathered about her , seated comfortably in the borrowed kitchen chair , began to enjoy the lateafternoonride . It would have been helpful if Mr. Glen had come out to speak to her again , she thought . But she knew he was tired , and there would be plenty of time to talk things over with him more fully tomorrow was n't that what he had said ? The bound boys on the driver 's seat continued to converse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the town behind them . They seemed shortly to have arrived at a satisfactory conclusionabout some important matter . Johann finally clapped Karl on the back . Once or twice they looked back at her . Doubtfully , she thought . Perhaps they wondered how she was getting on ? But she nodded reassuringly at them . And at that , they looked at each other and laughed . A half mile or so beyond the fort gate , they stopped to pick up a couple of barefoot girls picking their way along the road towards LeTort 's Springs . Evidently the boys knew them . There was some whispered conversation , giggles , a guffaw or two ; and then Johann explained in broken English that here were a couple of neighbours ' daughters , and he would like to give them a ride back home . Mrs. Larned had no objections , of course . She was even pleased at having been deferred to . The girls did look unkempt , slatterns , no doubt . But , then , this was Pennsylvania  --  and the manners of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the way to Boiling Springs with the German boys on the seat before her and the two girls sitting together , looking out behind . They never even glanced up at her . As twilight came on , she gathered her precious bundles closer about her . The mill must be farther out in the country than she had realized . The drive did seem to be a long one . It was twilight by the time Johann led the horses carefully over the water at the little ford , and black night fell as they trotted on down the road through the forest . Mrs. Lamed could see nothing at all . She had no idea now even in what direction she was going . At last they drew up in a starlit open space before a dim building . Karl went in to fetch a lanthorn . They sat waiting . No one spoke . The first thing she was aware of was the sleepy noise of continuallyfalling water . Insistently , the quiet music of the place began from the very first to sing itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a constant bubbling as though a great domestic kettle were forever boiling away , singing a lullaby to itself of hearth and home . Boiling SpringsWhy , this must be Mr. ( ; lea 's mill ! They were home ! Lights in the windows of the mill house began to shine . An approaching radiance poured out of f its open door . Karl came with the lanthorn to lead her in ; Johann handled her luggage . Afterward , when it was too late , she began to think that the behaviour of the two bound boys that evening was a bit strange . But at the time it all seemed , as far as she could see , right enough . The only thing that impressed her as being odd was that the boys seemed to be in a terrible hurry about everything Still , they took care to treat her courteously . And who was she to complain or to give directions in Mr. Glen 's house ? Doubtless , the boys knew exactly what their master wanted . Yet how they did rush about ! Karl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed her forthwith to what evidently must have been Mrs. Glen 's own bedroom . Karl had had to unlock the door for them . It seemed to have been locked and closed for a long time . The key worked with difficulty and the door complained . Had Mr. Glen really wanted her to sleep in his wife 's bed-chamber ? she inquired . " Ja , ja , " replied Johann emphatically . Mr. Glen himself had told him to take her there . Also to show her where everything was : thep303buttery , the storeroom , all the kitchen cupboards . She toiled after him . He unlocked them rapidly for her . Sometimes he took an article out and gave it to Karl . They were loading the wagon out there in the dark . She could hear the girls chattering . " Hurry , " one of them kept calling . " For God 's sake , you Dutch fools , get a move on ! " Yet the other girl came in and kindly built up the fire for her  --  between running in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larned offered to get supper , but the girl told her not to mind . This was the boys ' evening off , she explained . They would take both the girls home and spend the evening together . It was bellsnickelin ' time . They were in a hurry to get going , " before their off was all " . Mrs. Larned pieced this together as best she could . Well , she would get her own supper , then , after they had gone . She did n't exactly relish being left alone in a strange house . But it was natural , she thought , for the hired help to spend their evening together at the neighbour 's . She hoped they would n't bundle all night . But probably they would  --  and what could she do about it ? Nothing indeed  --  that was quite evident . The boys continued to load the wagon , probably for going to town tomorrow , she thought . They certainly had a heterogeneous assortment of articles to take back to Mr. Glen . At the last , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they carried out of the mill . Ah , probably that was it ! They were going to barter at early market tomorrow in town . Still , as moonrise came on , she stood in the doorway watching them doubtfully . Finally , they all clambered into the wagon together and drove off rapidly , without even saying a civil good night to her . They left her standing there in the moonlight , alone and listening to . . . what was it ? . . . oh , yes  --  the sound of flowing water .. . My gracious though , what was that ? Only some little owls ? She remembered them at home . They made a melancholy liquid bubbling sound , too . She shivered , drew her shawl closer ; and going in , closed the door behind her and locked it . As she stood watching the slow play of firelight on the walls and low ceiling of the room , and the black shadow down the hall from the single candle left burning in the bed-chamber , she clutched her old hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so deathly silent . It came upon her that she had been left strangely and fearfully alone . She stood listening , her heart pausing . In the breathless silence there was nothing ; nothing but a faint windy stir from the fire and an occasional crackle from the burning sticks , like a wicked chuckle .   And then , gradually , she became aware of it again . It penetrated the room from the outside . It seemed to saturate the log walls of the place , the mill house and the mill itself with an occasional dripping note from a subterranean harp and a low scarcely audible musical undertone ; secret , confidential , soothing . . . the sleepy noise of everfallingwater .. . She wakened slowly to hear the same music next morning . She scarcely knew where she was at first . She lay awhile like a child with her eyes closed , listening to the harp . It was a bit uncanny . Yet there were liquid runs on it that were positively cheerful . She smiled at her sleepy fancy that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , soothing her . She lay for a long while , resting . It had been a long journey . But she had slept so soundly , she felt renewed and refreshed . Also she had slept unconscionably late . It must be  --  why , to judge by the outside shadows , it must be well after ten o'clock ! Good heavenly gracious ! She wondered if Mr. Glen had come back yet . That would put her in a pretty pickle . Her first day as housekeeper  --  and she a sluggardlie-abed like this . She had n't slept like that for years . She sat up , listening . Except for some squirrels scampering over the roof , and the water , there was n't another sound . Yet it was cheerful in the daytime . The bedroom was cozy , dusty , to be sure , but the sun streamed in through a big window , reflected from the mill-pond . The light on the ceiling rippled . The house felt warm . She got out of bed , said her prayers iii gratitude , prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calmly to work . Work , in fact , hard work , was Mrs. Larned 's sovereign remedy and prime way of overcoming the difficulties of earthly existence . In her seventy-three years of experience , most of which she could vividly remember , she had seldom found work to fail . She had met reality in some of its more grisly aspects , previously , and was not easily to be fooled into a panic , even by an unexpected quirk of Providence . In short , she was prepared to carry on under almost any circumstances , so long as her body lasted . Nor did she at first regard the absence of the miller and his two bound boys as anything more than an unavoidable delay , one which their return would shortly explain . She simply turned in to make things ready for them . She had long been a widow , and being alone in the house was nothing new to her . Besides , the house itself was a positive delight . Outside , it was a substantial and ample log structure leaning up against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sealed with smooth chestnut boards , wall and ceiling , and it shone with a smooth grey silver light . Mrs. Glen'sP305old French furniture lent a lightness and grace , even a certain frivolity to the mill house , which was astonishing  --  to Mrs. Larned , almost immoral  --  yet pleasant . And there were hooked rugs on every floor , which at least displayed industry . Despite some inevitable qualms , she was soon forced to admit to herself that , log walls or not , here was a " hawnsome residence " within , and a pretty tribute to the dead woman who must have made it . For as she first went about the house that morning , Mrs. Larned everywhere came across dainty posthumous traces of the miller 's wife in every nook and cranny ; her thin white china on the painted shelves , her thick silky linens in chests , beautifully marked , and some ingeniously embroidered bedspreads bespattered with scattered spring wildflowers and gay , faded butterflies . Yet it was also equally apparent that no woman had been living in the mill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical and somewhat ascetic life of the miller and his two sons concealed as with a useful disguise of contemporary masculine disorder the original more fragile and exotic character of the establishment as initially arranged by Madam Glen . A leather hunting jacket hung from the gilded wreath around the portrait of a Huguenot ancestor , evidently a minister ; a porcelain shepherd and his shepherdess on the mantel had been pushed aside to make room for a bullet mould , clay pipes , and brown earthen jugs for snuff and tobacco ; a small library of calf-bound French polemics was buried under Philadelphia newspapers , Poor Richard 's Almanacs , and the tracts of the times . Here was a fertile field for Mrs. Larned 's earnest New England housekeeping proclivities . She saw that instantly , and set herself determinedly to putting everything to rights . She dusted , scrubbed floors , shined windows and the brass candlesticks and andirons . She turned the rugs , made up the beds with clean covers , moulding the bolsters like fine pieces of bakery . She hung up all the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closets where they properly belonged . Thus it was that the morning and the evening of the first day slipped away rapidly . Mr. Glen did not return . And then it was anotherday , and still another . The sound of falling water sang a soothing dirge for time . Mrs. Larned let the steeple-shaped clock on the mantel shelf stop . Between short intervals of preparing her own meals , which were essentially simple and mostly of a gruel-like consistency , for she had lost her teeth , she fairly flew about the house . 1s time went on , she planned her tasks to suit the brief morning or the long afternoon hours , and her own strength . She was conservative in her renovations , yet she was Yankily thorough about everything . In four days ' time , if Mr. Glen had returned , he would have found his mill house shining , restored within to the comfortable and quaintly elegant state of the early days of his French marriage ; but with a certain upright primness and sense of righteousness conferred upon it by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slack strings and all , Mrs. Larned still left standing behind the door , where she found it . When she swept the cobwebs off it , the feathers of her duster made it complain softly . But Mr. Glen did not return , nor the German servant boys either . Mrs. Lamed remained completely and entirely alone . Not even a wagon rattled past the door . Apparently not a soul lived in the neighbourhood , if neighbourhood there was . There was nothing all day long ; nothing but two cows that came home every evening to be milked , and the pervasive and interminable sound of flowing water . The cows were a welcome difficulty . Her old hands tired easily , but she managed to milk them . As day succeeded day , rapidly but monotonously , and still no one came , it would be idle to say that Mrs. Larned was not concerned about it . She certainly was , but she was more puzzled by the event than alarmed at its possible consequences . Undoubtedly , Providence for its own reasons seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways of the Lord were always mysterious , she reminded herself . And then , she was much too much a fellow-townswoman of both the Lord and Mr. I Honeywell to suspect either of them , even for an instant , of having collaborated in a joke . No , no , there was some entirely reasonable and serious explanation for her having been left alone that would eventually be vouchsafed her , probably by Mr. Glen himself . Patience rather than panic was called for . Panic and loneliness indeed were neither of them likely to prevail against Theodosia Larned . She had inner springs of strength that sang to her like the everlasting waters that flowed by the mill . Ever since the edifying , although apoplectic , demise of her husband during the late Great Awakening of only twenty years before , she also had been definitely convicted that she was one of God 's own elect . His Word , which she read every night , was always of infinite comfort to her as the inspired confirmation of her unavoidable salvation . Any worldly circumstance in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step towards assured heavenly bliss . And this faith , more than anything else , accounted for a certain simple complacencyof contentment in Mrs. Larned , even when she was in great adversity , which might otherwise have seemed foolish . Sustained by it , her lonely hours at the mill became , in fact , periods of grace in her own estimation , beads which she told , not without a certain penitential relish , on the stout thong of daily labour . And then , almost equal to the comfort of the Holy Word itself , P307pregnant perhaps with a warmer earthly hope , was Mr. Patton 's letter from Fort Lyttleton , which she kept in her Bible and read every evening , too . Bridget , the grandchild whom she had never seen , the last of her blood , was coming home to her arms . So the good Mr. Patton had written , and there was no reason to doubt him . Indeed , Mrs. Larned was now as much convinced of Bridget 's return as of her own divine election . The letter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She knew now , she was positively informed instinctively and directly , that Bridget would undoubtedly come driving up to the mill-house door , and that she had been sent there to prepare a place for her . That was what sustained her as the days went on . When , or whether , Mr. Glen and his family returned , or not , was merely an accessory circumstance before the miraculous fact of Bridget 's certain arrival . So  --  after the house iii general was all rid-up and even given an extra lick and polish in every corner , as she felt her bounden duty first required  --  Mrs. Lamed concentrated on getting ready for Bridget , and in particular on the bed-chamber where she knew the child would soon be sleeping . She cleaned it meticulously , wiping down the painted dado and the wooden walls . She disposed her own things there along with the presents she had long been preparing for Bridget , as favourably as possible . On a small dresser , which she took the liberty of removing from another room , she laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and toilet boxes before a small mirror not too much the worse for wear . There was also a neat sewing-case with needles , scissors , a child 's silver thimble , and skeins of bright-coloured thread . These were the chef-d'oeuvres of her offerings , things she had had bought in Philadelphia with some of the last shillings of her small stock of coins . On a marbled French table in the middle of the room she placed one of Mrs. Glen 's finest embroidered covers , a tall shining candlestick , and the Larned family Bible . She drew up a convenient rockingchair close by . The big bed in the corner she made up with double bolsters , after starching and smoothing the ruffled flounces overhead that had been drooping and turned faintly yellow front neglect . From underneath the big bed she pulled out the trundler , mended its saggingcords , and pounded its long-unused child 's mattress into shape . It could not be made soft or white enough to suit her , even with fine linen . Bridget was to sleep there , next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was on the trundle bed that she laid out the doll that had once belonged to her own daughter , ' Dosia , and an outfit of tiny dresses she had made for it . There , too , reposed the new clothes for Bridget ; P308dresses , knitted jackets , a red-ridinghood cloak , stockings , several petticoats , and small woollen underthings flounced with linen lace . All these she had made or restored herself with needles hard to thread ; with faltering but patient hands informed by love and the skill of seventy years . She arranged and rearranged them now , bedewingher handiwork with secret tears and the fond smiles of hope deferred . For the window that looked out over the mill-pond , the window that was always so cheerful in the morning , she washed and rehung Mrs. Glen 's fine lace fensters and tied them in with broad smiling bows . On the window-sill she placed her only and cherished treasure of the painter 's art , a small picture of a lamb done in tempera on olive-wood . It was carrying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coyly about it , while pausing on its other three , to baa , " IN HOC SIGNO VINCES . " The lamb , an eternal one , had been brought over from England by Mrs. Larned 's great-grandmother , and had survived , although with difficulty , for three generationsat Waltham , Massachusetts . There its Roman origin was Protestantly suspect , and the cross over the gonfalon had been carefullyerased . Nevertheless , Mrs. Lamed loved it . She and the Agnus Dei had innocently gambolled through the pagan meadows of childhood together , lost iu each other 's mild virginal dreams . And it was the lamb that now transformed and illumined the late Madam Glen 's erstwhile rather too worldly bedroom with his long-sustained ecclesiasticalgesture , so firmly fixed in tempera , and his mildly childlike but soft and comfortable Christian smile . Yes , it was the Lamb of God , strayed innocently out of the catacombsby way of a vanished British monastery into America . It had come almost as far west as it could get . Only the cross had been lost during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final . For the lamb was now the first thing that Mrs. Lamed saw in the window when she came into the room . And she kept coming back through the doorway again and again just to admire him , and to be sure that everything was ready to the last item for the child she should soon be leading in there by her hand . What would Bridget do ? Where would she pause to admire ? What would she say ? Mrs. Lamed clasped her aged hands in youthful anticipation . It did seem a long time that the Lord was requiring her to wait . After everything was ready , after she had explored and set to rights every part of the house , and even carried in some extra firewood , which gave her a lame back  --  still nobody came . Perhaps , if it had not been for the misery in her back and herP309painfully stiff limbs when it came to walking , she might have tried to get back to Carlisle . For after a week , or was it a week , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry was that she could n't be certain when the Sabbath day would fall . And even in a Pennsylvania town someone could tell her that . She had hoped her own marker in the Bible might still tell her . But she often read more than one chapterat one sitting , in the rocking chair , and she could n't be sure any longer . She might be three days ahead of herself in I Samuel now . A bad error , a lapse partaking of the fall of Adam , she thought . But when they came , she could rectify it . Certainly someone would come , sooner or later . Common sense insisted that the big mill and the mill house , all the furniture and all the property , could not be left abandoned for too long . No , someone must come soon . And yet -- how many days had she been there alone now , harkening to a dream-harp and the sad sound , the eternal whispering rush of ever-flowing water ? The evening before the weather changed and the storm came down , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the road . It was a sudden untimely impulse that had driven her forth , one which she soon began to regret . She could n't even rememberin what direction the town lay . It had been so dark that evening when they came from Carlisle . But she would try to see ; she would try to trace the wagon by its wheel ruts and hoof marks . There were many of these old wheel marks in the road , however , and they told her a confused tale . Afterwhile , it was nearing twilight , she came to a swift ford in a muddy river . It was not so far from the house , but it had taken her an hour to limp there . She now sat down to rest . To her terror , night began to fall . How foolish , how lacking in faith she had been to leave the house . Bridget might come while she was away ! And this was wild country , Pennsylvania ! She sat on a log waiting , waiting for something , she did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to herself again shivering and realized it was getting late . What should she do ? She was frightened now , frightened to the bone . The moon rose and those little owls began . Down the muddy river around its first but distant bend , firelight was glinting redly , reflected across the yellow water . A faint high singing floated on the wind . It was some time before she recognized , between the splashes of night-feeding fishes , the garbled melody of a familiar hymn . The firelight on the water became wider . Around the bend of the river stole the black shadow of an Indian canoe . Mrs. Larned got up from the log and fled wildly back to the house . She tottered through the door , all but finally exhausted , and forgot to lock it behind her . Thank God , the fire was still burning . SheP310had had her lesson . There were savages near-by . It was a sign . She must not go out of the house again . She must wait . Next morning a cold wind came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window-panes . She prayed anxiously for strength to endure . Winter had come , and she was all alone . Also  --  she was running out of flour in the kitchen crock . Well  --  at least there was plenty of that in the mill loft . Bags of it were stored on a platform between the rafters , high up away from the mice , she remembered . It was only a question whether she could climb the ladder . But probably  --  for flour she must have . She got a saucepan and a spoon from the kitchen , and hobbling back through the hall to the big door that led into the mill , she opened it with much difficulty , went up a few steps and peered into the place . It was comparatively dim there , a wide stretch of empty floor . The windows were small , and the arabesques of the mill rafters , beams , and wheel shafts crisscrossed the dusty gloom . But the ladder was there , just as she had last seen it , still in its place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flour bags lay like fat swine flopped on the planked platform between the beams of the loft . She could hear the water gurgling away under the mill floor and the mice scampering . A gleeful run of harp notes dripped under her feet as though a finger had netted the liquid strings . Gracious ! But she was no silly girl to he frightened by ... by mice ! She limped to the foot of the ladder and looked up . Finally , after putting the handle of the saucepan iii her mouth , and the spoon in her apron pocket , she began to climb . It was painful . But with both hands she held on hard , and resting between rungs , she slowly dragged herself up . The last rung now , all but one .. . It did seem terribly high up there . The shadowy floor lay miles beneath her . And how was she going to get the flour out of the bags ? At last she pushed the saucepan onto the platform with her mouth , and pulling the spoon out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of the nearest bag . Eventually a small hole appeared . She dug at it some more and flour began to stream out . She shifted the saucepan under it . It soon overflowed . My ! This was going to be wasteful . But at that instant her hands were frozen by terror ; the blood in her veins stopped . From the gloom of the depths below her a sepulchralvoice said : " Flow . " She poised there lightly , precariously clinging like a grey moth on a slanting leaf . Her flour-dusted skirt hung still and drooping behind her like a quiet wing . Her blood no longer whispered in herP311ears as she listened . . . listened . . . even the sound of flowing water seemed to pause .. " How , mizzy . " The guttural voice boomed dismally to crack the silence again . She looked behind her now . She looked down . In the shadows at the foot of the ladder stood an Indian holding up an empty bowl . . . holding up a pot . . . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gleamed . Mrs. Larned tottered on the ladder and lost her grip . She gasped , and threw up her hands .. . The flour reached the edge of the platform , poured over , and began to waste into the air . But Doctor Scarlet did not stay to fill his usual weekly bowl . He left instantly , flitting back through the silent house by the same way he had come . The door closed furtively behind him , and the mill house stood waiting . There was no one there now to tell whether the harp notes dripped in the silences or not . Afterwhile , the mice came out again to scamper over the wide millroom floor . Now and then a squirrel frisked across the roof . It was Sunday afternoon , but Mrs. Larned had forgotten . Only the sound of flowing water babbled on .   " Grandma That Art in Heaven " IT WAS TUESDAY morning when the wagon and the trundler passed through the gate by the artillery gardens without question and took the road for Boiling Springs . Jed drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were following the same road that Manoah Glen had covered in the opposite direction only a short while before . But , of course , Salathiel knew nothing as yet of the good miller 's fatal journey to town , nor of anything else that had followed . And it was this state of an as yet happy ignorance that had permitted him , as he rode along , to look forward with such confident anticipation to a prompt arrival at Boiling Springs . It had been part of a streak of his best luck to have run into Jim Fergus , he thought . Inside the wagon , Bridget sat wide-eyed but demure , swinging her feet nervously . She hoped her Grandma Larned would be like Mrs. McCandliss , soft-voiced , calm , lady-like . She kept putting her hand up to her new bonnet to straighten it . They were so near now . Frances was smiling contentedly . She , too , had hopes and cherished dreams of what Boiling Springs might be . But the possibility of her being parted from Bridget was not among them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often , she felt . But , as a consequence , and in less than half an hour , they were rumbling across the stout log trestle that carried the road over the branch at LeTort 's Springs . There they were forced to pull up to watch a heavy military convoy of four and twenty wagons turn off the highway for the camp at that much-frequented spot . The main camp of the garrison lay only a few rods down the stream below the log bridge where they were stalled . The engineers were busy there , he observed , filling in swampy places , a pet aversion of Bou- P313quet 's , and pegging new sods down on the bare glacis . There was a good deal going on at LeTort 's that would bear watching . " Get to it , men , " he muttered , not without a twinge of nostalgic envy . " Fly to it before Buckey gives you hell . " The camp had long been nearly empty of troops , but was being put in meticulous condition for the return of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some final spit and polish against his return . Its streets of white tents , the tall painted flagpole and new whitewashed barracks for the non-coms ; its bright brass cannon and precise entrenchments all seemed to have been laid out as an ironical rebuke or severe moral reprimand to the fiddling riot , squalid confusion , and frank abandon of restraint that went on day and night about the old stockade at LeTort 's Springs . Before that sorry place , the road to camp and the road to Carlisle parted , or joined , according to how you looked at it , and , by the passing and repassing of wagons , cavalry , artillery , farm vehicles and strings of pack horses , the cross-roads for a full half acre in front of LeTort 's were churned and rutted into a compost of halffrozenyellow mud . About this infernal tarn , a sad rookery of a village had grown tip . In dwellings that were compounded of everything not nice , those who wished to be as near as possible to the protection of the garrison had squalidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ souls in limbo , gathering in ragged , unkempt groups , these people picked the last shreds of meat from every bare bone of rumour that was thrown to them from the western wagons at the cross-roads . Immediately before the gate of the old stockade yard itself , and facing directly on the main road , one Ferdinand , a high yellow of West Indian origin , had set up a shack roofed with bark , old bottles on sticks , and streamers of flapping cloth . Every wind raised the hair on his emporium . Before it , an old kettle hung from a striped barber 's pole with a signboard beneath announcing in illiterate and drunken script the presence ofThe Barbadgeon ApathakerryFerdinand was sparse-bearded , had jaundiced eyes , and lived in a gentleman 's ancient red velvet dressing gown with a rampant gold crest on it . Apparently , there was almost nothing Ferdinand could not do for , or to , you if you would let him . Ile told fortunes by reading palms ; the future , with two coconut shags . He pulled teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mares , and bottled herb medicines for man or beast , etc. , etc . All this was not to be gathered from his sign . It was to be heard , however , if you could understand the strange gibberish in " Delaware-P314English " from the mouth of his old squaw and woman , who droned out from morning until night the gifts and merits of her lord and master , the father of her five children . They , too , helped loudly , and the combined sound was like that of wind through the knot-holes of a withered oak . It rose and fell . In the evenings , by the light of two pine-knots , a fiddler took the family 's place . Ferdinand 's was merry after the sun went down . In the day , though , there was nothing so efficacious to drum up trade as an ocular demonstration of the master 's skill . The convoy had made the turn into the camp , and the wagon had started to move forward again . But just as they drove by LeTort 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jed drew up by the kettle on the painted pole to let Frances and Bridget see . Salathiel turned back and waited . It was Ferdinand , the dentist , who now emerged from his den . He had a young white girl with him , wrapped in a meagre blanket . He rang a bell and began a talky-talk in " Spanish " . A haggard crowd rapidly gathered . The bell stopped . A pair of pliers emerged from the dirty folds of the red velvet gown . The girl screamed . The old squaw grabbed her from behind and hugged her like a squat bear . Ferdinand violently twisted out a tooth and held it up for all to see . The bell rang . The girl staggered over and leaned against the painted pole . The tooth was tossed into the pot . Ferdinand came forward and , bowing low before Frances at the back of the wagon , offered to read her palm . She shook her head violently . " ' Twill he an onlucky day for ye , me loin lady , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scattering mud and the crowd at the same time . She thought he had an Irish accent . But how , with such a yellow face ? She knew nothing of Barbadians . The wagon rolled onward . An English officer rode up and stopped to look at the girl sobbing convulsively against the painted post . Finally , he dismounted . " Here , you damned scoundrel , " he shouted at Ferdinand , " give me your forceps ! You 've drawn the wrong tooth ! " He opened the mouth of the girl , who gaped up at him . He pulled hard . Pus gushed out . She began to try to eat handfuls of snow , which rapidly turned scarlet . " That 'll do , " said the officer . I Le mounted , and trotted up the road to the camp . It was Surgeon Boyd . He was on his way back to England via Philadelphia . He was going to retire , and he was glad of it ; he was going to retire on a legacy . Ferdinand tossed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It clinked . The crowd laughed . It had been a good show . The wagon continued in its own direction . By such narrow margins do old friends fail to meet .. .  |p315They  were soon out in the very middle of the open fields between the town and the forest . On every side small hovels of sod , chinked logs , and fieldstone shouldered up like beavers ' huts above the weeds . ji ; Mud-and-stick chimneys leaked smoke . Yellow brush fires with forlornpeople gathered about their leaping flames dotted the landscape . Even in the fresh winter breeze , the place reeked . Here and there , men or women squatted shamelessly over shallow trenches . They were long past caring . A few thin cows , their bells clanging fu-nereally , grazed along the road . How many people were living thus in the ground , waiting dismally , it was hard to tell . There seemed to be miles of them . But all of these places were not inhabited . Scars and pits of former encampments pock-marked the fields everywhere . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salathiel was glad of that . It would he more decent when they came to the woods again . They took the south fork at the next cross-roads . In a few momentsthe forest closed over and behind them . The silence smelled sweet . The road to Boiling Springs was quite good , considering it had n't been used much lately . The wheels rolled silently now over deep leaf mould . The harness bells chimed secretly in the solitude . Salathiel felt better and rode straighter in the saddle . Just ahead the water of a small stream glinted through the trees . They must be coming to a ford . Probably a shallow one .. . Goddam . . . what the devil ... ? All the horses seemed to be going crazy at once . Enna reared and walked about on her hind legs , pawing the air . She " trumpeted " with nervous fright . The lead team of the wagon was trying to tear itself out of harness . The others backed and filled . They swerved violently , and the big ash single-tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all the horses playing merry hell . . . Judaspriest. . . where could he ever get another single-tree like that ? And Jed ? " Hey , Jed ! " Jed arose from a ditch full of leaves where he had been neatlycatapulted , but with enough sense left in his dazed head to snatch atthe lead team 's bridles and hang on . He began to batter them in theface with his old hat . Salathiel forced Enna to the rear of the trundler , tied her fast , and then racing forward on foot joined Jed inhis battle with the frantic teams . It was hard , swift struggling for aminute or two . Finally , he shouted to Frances to toss him out someblankets , which he wrapped around the horses ' heads . They stoodquiet at last , sweating and trembling , looking like a procession ofblind , bandaged invalids halting in the road , but breathing tranquilly . It could n't be something they had scented , then . It must have beensomething downwind , or something they saw . But what the devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He walked down the road cautiously . Damnation ! That was it  --  nothing but a white lightning blaze on an old thunder-tree . Horses were the durndest fools , and the single-tree was cracked . Then he saw what Karl and Johann had seen , and began to laugh . To think that that had nearly wrecked them . He ran forward , and leaping the stream lightly , began to cut some young cedars and pile them against the sprawling white blaze on the thunder-tree . It was not long before the thing disappeared . Only a stack of green trees stood there now . " Come on , Jed , " he shouted . " Just keep ' em blinded and lead ' em easy . There 's nothin ' to be skeered of but an old wagon , and it 's lyin ' wheels upward in the ford . " Nevertheless , he was quite relieved and happy when " the hul consarn " , including Enna , finally stood breathing easily as usual , safe on the other side . He took the blankets off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken it commendably well . Frances was more anxious about the cracked single-tree than scared at what had happened . Would the single-tree last , did he think , as far as Boiling Springs ? " Probably , " he answered briefly , after inspecting it , but Jed would certainly have to drive slow . He himself would ride ahead now , at quite a distance . The " tree " would n't take any more surprises . Mounting Enna thankfully , he trotted ahead . It was not long before he left the wagon well behind him . The forest road stretched before , curving away easily through the sunny woodlands . There were no fresh wheel marks , he noted . It would be hard to tell how lung it had been since the last wagon had passed . The storm had come that way recently . Presently , between the nervous clip-clop of  --  na 's hoofs , he began to hear a sound like a breeze stirring through the forest . Yet what autumn leaves remained hung stiff and listless . It was the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boiling Springs . Before him , down a stretch of smooth road covered with tamped river gravel , lay the open space in the forest that was Boiling Springs . A patch of sunshine glinted brazenly on the troubled ford at the far end of the vista , where Yellow Breeches Creek rolled through the trees . The noise of falling water now seemed to accentuaterather than to lighten the silence . The place seemed totally deserted , eerie with the absence of any human noise . On one side of the road stretched a shingled horse shed that ended against a log house . The house in its turn was part of a large mill , stone underneath , with logs in the story above . On the opposite side of the road , a considerable two-story dwelling slept in the cold sunshine , its porchp317sagging and covered with sodden leaves . A dry bush of many seasons past hung like the skeleton hand of dead hospitality withering above the door . A fox trotted across the road and stopped to look at him . Boiling Springs , eh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be complaining about something . The mill-pond trembled slightly , reflecting a wavering picture of the mill with icicles hanging from its wheel . The bare trees that surroundedit were upholstered in white rime-frost from roots to tips . There was no wind in this sequestered vale . A thicket of sumac blazing with red candles hemmed in the race . Enna stamped uneasily . There was only one sign of life , a blue haze hovered over the top of the chimney of the mill house . Salathiel rose in his stirrups . " Mrs. Larned , " he shouted . " Are you there , Mrs. Larned ? " There was no answer . Perhaps he should have called for Mr. Glen ? The wagon came in sight . Ile waited for it to draw up and told them to tarry for a minute . He 'd like to look the place over himself first . Bridget sat quiet but tense , holding her basket with the kitten in it on her knees . She hoped her grandma would like cats . She looked preternaturally neat and vividly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Salathiel said , patting her hand . Frances looked up apprehensively . He winked at her , conveying a sense of caution . " We 'll wait for ye , " she said . " Put the horses in the shed , Jed , " he ordered , as he tied Enna to a post and crossed the road towards the mill house . " Liken we 'll be staying here for quite a spell . " His remark encouraged Frances and Bridget greatly . They already liked the quiet of the place , the cheerful splash of the water . " Like home , " sighed Bridget . " You know , Lissa , I 'd almost forgot . " Her eyes shone . Frances put an arm about her . Salathiel walked over to the mill house and knocked at the front door . He waited . He knocked again  --  and then trying the latch , he found the door opened , and stepped inside . The door shut behind him . A small flurry of ashes lifted in the fireplace . There were still some living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hearth . The room was bright . Two large windows overlooked the millpondat its far end . The light reflected ripples on the silver-grey ceiling , and the whole place swam . But it was certainly comfortable . Alive . Mrs. Glen 's old-fashioned furniture , nicely covered with faded green cloth , looked luxurious to Salathiel . There were books on a hanging shelf . Jars for tobacco and snuff were arranged on a trayP318with several long-stemmed clay pipes . On the mantelpiece , a shepherd and a shepherdess smiled in gold and blue at either end . A small clock stood between them . It was silent . In a rocking chair , two bone needles thrust upward from a pile of new knitting were still caught in the last stitch . But the room was growing cold . He went over to the hearth and laid a few sticks of light-wood on the fire and stood waiting ... . " Mrs. Larned , " he called again . " Mrs. Larned , your Bridget 's here ! " A squirrel scurried over the roof ... . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the various rooms that opened off it . There were two rooms on each side . The first one was undoubtedly the old lady 's . An embroidered counterpane covered the bed in the corner ; and a crazy quilt , the little trundle bed next to it . No matter which way he turned , a silly lamb on the window-sill followed him with its smile . A bureau and a small dresser stood with feminine things , waiting . A small table with an embroidered linen cover held a big Bible . It lay open before a half-burned candle that had been neatly snuffed . It looked like an altar , he thought , but there was a rocking chair drawn up next to it . Ile walked to the table and glanced at the back of the Bible . Yes , there could he no doubt of it . . . the whole Larned family tree was there  --  and Mr. I'atton 's letter ! Very carefully he laid the Book back where it had been , still open at the sane place . It was somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was covered with things that , quite evidently , Mrs. Larned had made for Bridget . They were all too small for her , he thought . But pretty damn dainty , too . And there were some toy clothes and an old *loll . There was also a faint stale odour like old white people . I lc wrinkled his nose and backed out , closing the door . The other three rooms all had men 's clothes in them . One seemed to have been recently lived in . The miller 's own , he judged . A pair of wrinkled flour-dusty gloves lay on the stand . That room did n't smell so good , either . Mr. Glen , if it were his , undoubtedly took Swedish snuff . He closed that door , too . The silence of the house against the sound of water was suddenlyoverpowering . No one at home ! Maybe the old lady had gone for a visit to the neighbour 's to borrow something  --  or ? She could n't have been gone long . Well , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall , heavy and massive , closed . He walked to it and rapped . A scurrying of innumerable small feet onp319the other side came to him faintly . . . . It ceased . He opened the door and went up five steps . It was a big place filled with twilight from some windows high up , fogged with flour dust . He was in the mill itself . The half-visible shafts and wooden beams of mill machinery , the strange shapes of flumes and hoppers studded the darkness under the high roof . Mice squeaked , and the water gurgled away underneath the floor . Sometimesit dripped musically . Ile turned suddenly . Something dead was close by . There it was ! He first saw her silver hair shining in the semi-darkness . She was lying at the foot of a ladder that led up into a half-loft on the beams above , where many bags of meal were piled . There was a small saucepan at the foot of the ladder and a high cone of loose flour that must have run out of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her left side , her head twisted under her arm , her neck broken . " There were no marks on her that he could see . One thing now stood out above all else , the intensely neat part in her smooth silver hair . Her back comb was broken . She was cold , stiff . She had been dead for a long time , he judged . He went hastily and got a candle to see better . It was then that he saw the moccasin tracks in the flour dust on the floor . They led from the door , where he had come in , to the foot of the ladder . One pair of moccasins , one person . Whoever it was had turned around in them and walked back to the door again , stepping exactly where he had stepped before . He could see the faint double trace . There was no doubt of it . Whoever had come had gone some time ago , and through the house . There were mice tracks over the big trail . The saucepan was half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He climbed up . A spoon was caught in the threads about the hole . He thought he could tell now what had happened . Mrs. Lamed must have been standing on the ladder , digging into the bag , when she heard moccasins behind her . She must have looked back and seen an Injun . He could n't be sure of that . Other people wore moccasins . But probably , probably it was an In jun . And ladies from Boston were not used to seeing Injuns at the bottom of ladders . She had fallen ? Maybe ? He would have to go into that carefully . If it had been old Doctor Scarlet , it would not be so easy for him to keep his fine promise to Jim Fergus , just to say " how " . But he would have to look into all that later . He rose from his knees and blew out the candle . Just now there was Frances to think of first  --  and Bridget ! God ease her little soul ! He would have to manage itP320quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there in the wagon . He tied the mill-room door behind him with a thong and a knot that would have to be cut . It was the " death knot " that Kaysinata had showed him . When he got back to the room , the fire was blazing up brightly . It crackled and talked . That was what really settled the matter for him . He went to the door and called them . " Come in , sweethearts , " he cried . " The place is all warm and waitin ' for ye . Granny 's away , I guess . But she 's been expectin ' ye . Come and look ! " Frances ' eyes veiled with a mist of pleasure as she entered and looked about the room . The fire leaped cheerfully , the brasses glinted . " Take your bonnet off , " she said to Bridget , who had been rushing around examining everything and was now rocking in the chair before the hearth . " I want your grandma to see your pretty brown hair . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her man . She saw something was wrong . " Bridget , go into that room and see what Mrs. Larned has made for you , " he said . " She 'll want you to know . " The child got up and tiptoed to the first door down the hall to which he pointed . " Grandma , " she called . " Go in , " he said . They stood listening to the chill 's ecstatic cries . " The lamb , oh , the dear , dear land ) . . . " IIe took prances ' hands and held then ) tight . " Keep her close here . Keep her happy in this place until I can git back . " " What is it ? " she demanded . " Can you bear it ? " he asked . " Yis , " she said . " Is it so bad ? " " Terrible , " he whispered . She stood waiting . " Grandma fell off a ladder and broke her neck . She 's lyin ' stark and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can ye keep Bridget here until Jed and I can hide her ? " " Yis , " she whispered , and sank down in the rocking chair . The tears sprang out of her eyes now . " Mother of God , " she whispered , and crossed herself . She sat looking into the cheerful crackling fire , in misery . A few seconds ago it had seemed to be warming her heart . Now . . . " Look , Melissa , " he whispered , leaning down over her , " I 'm not goin ' to leave here for a while . We 've got no other place to go . And yon is the hearth fire she laid for us . I was just in time to save the flame alive . "   " Let it burn then , " she said . " ' T is God 's will . I 'll beguile the child . You go out and do what must be done , and say a prayer , " she said . " Do ye know one ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left her before the fire . Bridget was calling to Frances as he closed the door . " Bring two spades from the side-box , Jed , " was all he said . It took small time to dispose of Theodosia Lamed . He and Jed got her out of the mill by the back way . He picked a high dry site quite a distance back from the road . They dug a deep grave in the soft red soil , lined it with fallen leaves , and laid her in it , with her face looking east at the house . Jed was not badly frightened . It was bright daylight , and he thought of Bridget 's sad case , and wept copiously . Mrs. Lamed smiled behind a veil of autumn leaves . Her eyes were half open as though she were quite sleepy . He closed them with two silver shillings , and said a prayer . Jed said " Amen " over and over again , and then prayed himself . They covered her quickly and quite deep . Then they dragged some heavy logs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salathiel cleansed himself carefully and changed into his decent blue clothes before he went back into the house . He nodded to Frances and sat down before the fire . Bridget was nursing her new doll . The kitten lay stretched out , purring . He called to Jed to get some heavy wood for the hearth . Melissa had taken up the knitting where Mrs. Larned had left off . A sleeve on the little jacket was growing longer . She had even started the clock . Stolen time in another man 's house , he thought . He 'd explain it , nevertheless . He 'd make it right with the miller . Mr. Glen would just have to bear with them . Surely he must have a good heart , if he 'd sheltered the old lady . Surely he would understand . But Mr. Glen did not return . No one came . It would have been a hard afternoon to pass if they had not turned in to put all to rights in the wagon and the house for staying . Frances made much of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while . It was only as the late afternoon wore away towards evening that Bridget became subdued and silent . Everybody was hungry and eager for supper . They had it on a small table drawn up before the fire . There were three candles . And Jed was proud to show that he knew how to wait on them . He set three places with blue plates and a white cloth . Frances looked at it before she sat down , happily . Bridget went over in the corner and began to drag out another chair . " It 's for grandma , " she explained . Then she stopped . They were all so silent . She saw tears in Jed 's eyes .   " Ai n't she coming ? " she asked finally , and looked at Salathiel . He shook his head . " Liken she 's gone to be with Mrs. McCandliss , " he said huskily . " That 's the way it is . " He did n't know it , but it was the best way he could have put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath in sharply . She left the chair and came over and sat down , round-eyed . Salathiel said Colonel Chambers 's grace . They ate quietly . Melissa began to talk afterwhile about the fine things she was going to make , now that there would be time and a spell free from travelling . There would be a new dress for Queen Alliquippa , paduasoy , with a dash of royal scarlet . Bridget considered this . She listened solemnly . After supper Salathiel sat smoking before the fire , watching Melissa 's scissors snip at the cloth patterns she was laying out . Jed slumbered heavily in a corner . The cat walked about with her tail in the air . Presently , Frances took Bridget into Mrs. Larned 's room . She looked at him significantly as she went out . He heard them undressingtogether . Then there was a moment of quiet murmuring . He could n't hear what Bridget was saying . But Frances did . The child was on her knees and had laid her head in Frances ' lap as she always did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tightly closed eyes , but the tears cane through . " Grandma , " she began , " grandma , that art in heaven ... " Melissa comforted her as best she could . They cried it out together in the rocking chair . They went to bed afterwhile and left the candle burning . Frances held Bridget close . It would have been too much to try to go to sleep in the dark the first night . Not in the old lady 's own room . She looked at the lamb and crossed herself ... . Salathiel sat late before the lire pondering . He waited up , expectingMr . Glen . Time passed with the ticking clock and the sound of rushing water . He whittled , and did a good deal of thinking . He sure was in for it now . How mysterious things were , how unexpectedlythey turned out ! It was enough to daunt a man . Up there with shillings on her eyes ! Did she know ? Anyway , they 'd have to keep Bridget now . What was that ? Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did n't blame him . The house surely was kind of . . . kind of strange . He saw that the candle was still burning in the women 's room . Could it be that Mrs. Larned 's open Bible might have a message for him ? She might have meant it that way . The Word of God ! Well , he would see . At any rate , he would outen the candle before it burned to the socket . Ip323He slipped to the door of the bedroom and looked in . Melissa and Bridget lay asleep in each other 's arms . Melissa 's dark hair streamed down over her shoulders to mix with the brown locks of the child . They were both unearthly beautiful in the candlelight , he thought . White as angels . Oh , Lord , now who had done that ? Now was n't that just like the women ! It must have been Frances . The Bible on the stand was closed . P324The Triumph of Brigadier BouquetTHE MUSIC was coming clown the great western road , military music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marches that had marked the weary forest miles all the way back from the Ohio country still ticked off the final paces of Bouquet 's veterans returning to Carlisle , like a space clock , while the gaitered legs of the regulars swung in pendulum . But these single taps were only reminders now , heartbeats out of the embattled past that scented to return as memories will , with a plaintive throb between wild bursts of louder music . The skirl of bagpipes and the shrill whistling of fifes alternated , only to be overwhelmed by the rolling of massed snare-drums ; topped by the light high lilt of happy bugles . Mien the trumpets glinted in sound , sunlight seemed suddenly reflected from dark water . And then the single drum taps would resume . A warning gun boomed solemnly from Fort Lowther . The music was coming down the great western road , drawing nearer every minute , the music of l h-Brigadier General Bouquet . All Carlisle bestirred itself instantly . Like the Shawanese towns on the Muskingum , it , too , was being taken by surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to steal a march even on his friends in peacetime . He strove to be his own harbinger . It was good strategy at any time . It served to discover the incompetent and disconcert the complacent ones . It saved a deal of official tomfoolery . It amused him , and  --  after all  --  he was only ten hours ahead of himself today . However , that was the reason the commandant at Fort Lowther had fired an alarm gun . He was alarmed . Lieutenant Colonel Asher Clayton had had a beautiful plan to receive the general in right military style and full regalia , everyP325button , even on the goddamned militia , bright and in place . When the news of Bouquet 's having reached Shippensburg came in only the night before , he had immediately begun to issue orders . He had even conferred with the Reverend Mr. Duffield and Mr. Tilingham , the schoolmaster , about the erection of a triumphal arch of evergreenswith the general 's name and " Ante Tubam Trepidant " worked in with goldenrod and mountain laurel . Twelve little girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daisies , if there were any . And now ! Now , all this was spoiled , cancelled . The arch , the noble Latin sentiment , the twelve maidens  --  none of them would be there . The general 's music was coming down the great western road , and the devil was to pay . Boom ! Actually , it was only the commandant who was alarmed . Everybodyelse was delighted , and they could hear the music for themselves . The best Colonel Clayton could do was to line the square immediately on all four sides with the regulars of the garrison , and even some of his invalids , drawn up in single rank ; and to mass the militia by companies at the entrance to the square and down the great western road . And it was well he did so , for the brave news had spread like wildfire . The commandant might have saved the king 's powder . Long before the alarm gun was fired , some people had heard the music and begun to stream in from the fields and down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square . Soon there was a solid mass of them between the houses and the thin line in scarlet and white cross-belts that fenced off the rectangular open space kept in the middle of the square . People crowded every doorway and hung out of the upper windows . Even the low shingled roofs were packed with spectators , and the few scraggly trees that rose here and there from dooryards dripped with boys . The place reverberated with a clang of wild talk , shouts , and a resurgent hum of eager expectation . But to Colonel Clayton 's relief , the noise was all good-natured . It was a fine sunny , winter afternoon , and for once the crowd seemed inclined to govern itself . There was a rare feeling of common interest and enthusiasm abroad , a spontaneousundercurrent of satisfaction and loyalty . That was a novel experience for the colonel . It was the first , and , as a matter of fact when he came to recollect it long afterwards , it was the last and only time during his long service in the colonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  loyal subjects of the crown , as he phrased it  --  all at one with themselves . Even the backwoods characters in buckskins seemed less sullen than usual . They stopped pushing people aside rudely , and actually stood lost in cheerful talk ,  | waiting quietly , apparently willing to join the majority in giving Buckey a good rousing welcome . Whether it was Bouquet 's personal popularity , the thrill of victory , or the return of the captivated that most moved the various individuals composing the crowd made little difference . In any case , long-deferred hopes were about to be satisfied , and both citizens and soldiery were alike in their enthusiasm . The happy surprise of Bouquet 's early arrival was intensely gratifying . That , indeed , was the common interest and uncommon excitement which drew everyone to the square , for there were few residents of Carlisle who would not have some poignant private interest in the spectacle of the brigadier 's return . Everybody who was not an invalid , and not a few of the wounded , crippled as they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had poured itself into Carlisle . The hovels in the surrounding fields were left entirely deserted . The numerous employes and clerks of Boynton , Wharton &; Morgan and the other merchants and contractors had left their various posts and hurried into town . The lucky householders contended with their boarders and throngs of eager strangers for a place at their own windows , doorways , or front porches . Turbanned house servants , and the humbler coloured denizens of the place , even field hands , managed somehow to be inconspicuous , but present . Their excitement , in fact , was greater than anyone else 's and harmonically contagious , for from time to time they broke into shouts of " Glory be " , rhythmic shufflings , and snatches of gospel hymns . By the time the music coining down the road could be heard clearly , as the returning regiments emerged from the forest and approached the town across the open fields , the commandant himself was inclined to feel satisfied . The general 's reception seemed to have arranged itself by general consent . Authority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There would be no evergreen arches or female children in white scattering posies  --  but that was not his fault . And there must be between six and seven thousand persons present in and about the square , he figured , probably inaccurately . He and his staff , the mayor , the burgesses , Colonel John Armstrong , and other military and civil notables and worthies were gathered together waiting , either on horseback or on foot , as a kind of hastily arranged reception committee , before the west gate of the fort . On the whole , Colonel Clayton felt , the brigadier was bound to be pleased . But like everyone else , as the drums and music came nearer , his gaze and attention were soon entirely detained by the corner of the stockade wall and High Street , where the van of Bouquet 's column might now at any moment be expected to appear . To say that the centre and cause of all this excitement andp327interest , Brigadier General Henry Bouquet himself , was not interested in how he was going to be received at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not be accurate . Undoubtedlyhe was interested , but he was highly intrigued rather than deeply concerned . Being of an intensely practical and far-seeing , if not prophetic turn of mind , he was never indifferent to what properly , concerned him and his officers and men . But at the present moment , for various reasons , his thoughts were projected into the future rather than amused by the present or bemused by the past . In short , as he rode along with his tired adjutant and a couple of mounted messengers who comprised his modest staff , splashed with mud , and in a faded uniform frayed by a long campaign , he was not in that vainglorious and self-gratulatory frame of mind , which , it is said , has at times been known to accompany victorious generals returning home . Such a mood and such an attitude could not be entertained by a man of Bouquet 's genius and depth of character . Despite years of professional service under many flags , Henry Bouquet remained an essentially modest , kindly , and devoted man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outfaced both death and defeat in hard-won battles , and was therefore inclined to bear his laurels as he had borne intolerable responsibility , patiently , and chastened by an ironic sense of humour . Oval- and olive-faced , taller than most , he now rode forward about the middle of the column , upon a borrowed government nag , shaggier perhaps than was necessary , and with stirrups too near the ground , but competent and convincing withal ; a big man upon a little horse , whose choice of the best , if not the most impressive means of always arriving successfully had won him first the grudging respect and finally the devoted affection of all his veterans , regulars and colonials , who now trudged before and behind him . His and their immediate destination was a rousing and grateful welcome at Carlisle , he hoped , but that is not to say he was preoccupied or intended to be overwhelmed by it . In several ways things might , and in his own opinion , ought to have been even better than they were . The balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt , entirely too nice . His cup was full , but it had never run over . And it would have been gay , he thought with a Gallic grimace , to have been able to thank the gods lavishly by spilling a few extra drops even of sour wine . As it was , there was wine , but there was none to spare . He had won all his battles , but in the process lost his only lady love . His promotion to brigadier had arrived unexpectedly , for the crown was slow to recognize merit in foreigners , and how long , 0 Lord , how long , had he not sustained as colonel of the Royal Americans the condescension of cultivated British generals and the defence of the savage frontiers ? Now he was brigadier and the applause and affection of the Pennsylvanians and Virginians were his ; and now he would have to leave them all forthwith . For he had also been appointed to the command of the new Southern Department . Headquarters would be at Pensacola instead of at Philadelphia or New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At a little higher salary , he might soon become the Alexander of Louisiana , the conqueror of innumerable barbarian tribes , the Twigtees , par exemple . There would be fatal fevers , but no Babylons to die in . Heigh-ho , c'est la guerre ! " Oh , Richard , oh , mon roi ! " He whistled through a few staves of the old tune , his brown eyes wideningwith speculation on the future , and then narrowing with regret . Now there would be no settling down on the plantation near Frederick . Peggy Willing would not come home with him as a bride to be mistress there . Ecuyer was gone , that plucky little devil . No hands of whist and no bottles of Burgundy before the fire in the evenings together . Those capable of conversation always died first , exhausted by trying to explain the obvious . And he would have liked to talk it out with S. Ecuyer as a neighbour . In Maryland they might both have cultivated adjoining gardens . But silence would sit before the fire at Frederick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an uncomfortable premonition . . . . The Alsatian girl could have the place . The land he had lc it her ought to be enough to close her mouth , although she could talk in three languages . Land ! He had plenty of that . Land about Bedford , land in Maryland . What good did it do him now ? It was the fault of the War Department in promoting him and transferring him , too . Or it was the fault of English generals , red-faced , stupid , corpulent , spawn of the Horse Guards and a Hanoverian Bellona ; bellicose , pampered cupids sent to fight Indians ! Sacrcbleu , how had they ever prevailed ? It was inscrutable that the same country had given birth to Marlborough . A little more and they would lose what the great duke had gained . Probably he had lost Peggy Willing just from the necessity of having to correspond with them . It was a fatal epistolary style to acquire . He must have addressed her , that charming girl , as though she were an adjutant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amherst or to the late Duke of Cumberland . Name of a dog , that must be it ! No wonder she had n't waited for him . No wonder she 'd married her Philadelphia beau . Yes , his love letters had been fatal ! Nothing less than official  --  and soPeggy would not be waiting for him at Carlisle . She would not be watching for him when he marched in . None of her family , not even Ed Shippen , would be there . Colonel Burd , as a dutiful son-P329in-law of the family Shippen , would be dutifully sulking at Lancaster , glad of an excuse to stay away . A triumph  --  but no place to lay his head afterward , and no pretty head beside him on the pillow . Well , it would be headquarters again , a military family . But , by God , he 'd set himself up well in Philadelphia for a while before he left for Florida . He 'd get some help in that . He 'd hold his head high , despite Peggy . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they certainly deserved it . But the poor rescued captives would need something more sustaining than huzzas . And he 'd see the people he had liberated taken care of . They 'd remember him for that . Yes , he 'd look after them ; see that every last one of them , orphans and all , found work or a place they could call home . After that , for him  --  Pensacola . Ah , quelle in gnifique dispensation du ciel ! He brought the column to a halt and for the last time rode up and down it , with his hat off , while the men closed up . Another quarter of a mile and they would be entering the town . There was a certain military pathos in thus seeing an army , his small but victoriousarmy , all drawn up in familiar formation for the last time . Never again ! They understood . They began cheering him as he passed . It was good-bye . He sent the 42nd Highlanders forward . The honour of the first acclamations should be theirs . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bagpipes struck up " When All the Blue Bonnets Came Over the Border , " the drums danced . The column stepped out like one man . A thousand times they had all dreamed of this . In the square at Carlisle the crowd began to roar . It was due to sheer blind luck , and a little more , that both Salathiel and Frances were in Carlisle the day " Gineral Buckey " marched in . Jim Fergus had come back from Lancaster only the morning before , and , happening to meet Mr. Williams on the square , he had heard , much to his consternation , about the death of Mr. Glen . Mr. Glen had then been buried but a few clays , a hasty funeral attended by some friends but none of the fancily . For both the Glen boys were known to be away , and so far as Mr. Williams or anybody else knew , there was no one at the mill but two German redemptioners . " A sad case , quite perplexing and totally unexpected , " explained Mr. Williams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Williams went out and found him sitting there . " No , the wagon had not come back from the mill next morning to get him . Nor had Mr. Williams , or anyone else , had time yet to ride out to Boiling Springs . He and his wife had had their hands quite full . Something had to be done with a dead man pretty quick . Well , they had done the best they could . No one even knew where Mrs. Glen was buried . The commandant had " loaned " them a pine coffin , 330 TOWARD THE MORNINGP330whatever that meant . How could you " lend " a coffin ? Who would pay for it ? Mr. Glen had been a man of property . But where were his heirs , and who was his lawyer ? At least the interment had been Christian . Mr. Williams would not listen to what Jim Fergus was trying to say . He was out of pocket two pounds ten and was not to be interrupted . It was a serious matter for a small grocer like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high . He shook his head and , before Jim could make any further remarks , went on his way still looking puzzled . Beyond saying that at least one of the Glen boys would soon return with Bouquet , Jim Fergus had not been able to offer Mr. Williams much comfort . He thought he would not add to the good man 's perplexity by mentioning anything about Mrs. Larned , the Albines , and all that . But , good Lord , what had become of the old lady ? Doubtless , Mr. Honeywell had departed for Boston as he had said , and Jim strongly suspected the German boys had cleared out , too . Had they left the old lady alone or had they fixed her ? Had the Albines found her yet ? A hundred questions ran through his head . Jim was genuinely concerned . He was a good friend of the Glens ' . Also he 'd liked Salathiel . What an unexpected mess it all was . He was tired after the trip to Lancaster , but he 'd ride down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he could get his mare 's off-shoe tightened . So , ride down he ( lid , and arrived about suppertime . The Albines were there , and he soon heard all about Mrs. Larned , or all that there was to hear . It seemed had . Ile was inclined to blame the German redemptioners . Ile did n't take much stock in the moccasin tracks at the foot of the ladder . Maybe old Doc Scarlet had come in for some meal and found her lying there . Like enough , agreed Salathiel . But the doc had lit out for the mountains . He was n't camped on the stream any more . He 'd just naturally do that , insisted Jim . Well , there was no way of finding out immejit . They 'd have to wait and trace down the redemptioners . Maybe they could ? But it would take time . Meanwhile , the Albines were much confused and not a little embarrassed at finding themselves , and no one else , at home at the mill . Jim Fergus was not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a lucky happenstance for the Glens , he argued . Otherwise the mill and the house would have been left deserted . They 'd better stay on until one of the Glen boys came home . He 'd take it on himself to say he thought both the brothers would be pleased . Any drunken fool might come along and burn the whole place down . No , no , they must stay until they heard . All he knew was that either John or Martin would be back sooner or later ,  |p331and  that the old man had made a will by the advice of a smart lawyer . " A man by the name of Ed Yates , practises out of Lancaster , when he ai n't ridin ' the borders on Penn family affairs . " They could get in touch with him if they wanted to . Mr. Yates would be in Carlisleon a land case tomorrow , he 'd heard him say only last Tuesday up at Lancaster . Yates had asked him to get him a place to stay at the Williamses ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . He was that flustered when he met Mr. Williams , who talked all the time , that he had n't said a word about it to the old man . " Doggone it "  --  he smote his knee with vexation . " Well , I 'll be damned , " said Salathiel . " I 'll be double damned ! " He and Frances looked at each other . Frances laughed . " Sure , and it 's fate , " she said . " I 'll be after makin ' up one o ' the Glens ' bedrooms for ye , Mr. Fairgus . Ye 're the most welcome body with a soul in it I 've seen for many a long ( lay . And it 's a koind heart ye have , too . I was beginnin ' to think that the rest of the world had been destroyed intirely , sittin ' here listenin ' to the sound of fallin ' water . But it 's a snug , sunny little house , and Sal has shot a turkey for supper . Bridget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yer hair . We have company . " Jim Fergus was favourably impressed . The house shone . The supper was excellent . He listened to the murmur of prayers after Bridget went off to bed . Sal Albine had found himself a mighty spry young wife . The Glens were lucky . He 'd drop in this way again . The ford was a short cut to Shippensburg . He 'd remember . Poor old Mrs. Larned , what a fall she 'd had ! He yawned , had a nip , and went to bed . Next morning they were up bright and early . Salathiel put Enna in the Glens ' two-wheeled cart and drove off to town with Frances beside him . Jed and Bridget were left to keep house together . It could n't be helped . They hoped to find Yates at Carlisle and persuade him to come back with them . That , Frances suggested , might not be so hard to do . But what she needed was another woman iii the house . A lawyer would not be much help in having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove on steadily . Enna made a good cart horse , he observed . When they got to LeTort 's they heard the general 's music coining down the great western road . And , as if they did n't know it themselves , Jim Fergus kept riding up behind them shouting out what it was . They were caught in the crowd rushing to town , and if Salathiel had n't turned Enna off the road and driven the little cart directly across the fields , they might never have got into the square at all . As it was , they were stopped just at the corner of High Street and the stockade by a sergeant of the guard , an old Fort Pitter whomP332Salathiel recognized , and forced back against the wall . It was within a few feet of the place where Mr. Glen had tied up his wagon for the last time . It was Salathiel now who stood up and looked across the heads of the crowd , hemmed in by the lines of redcoats , and the empty space in the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few rods away to his right . Good enough , he thought . Luck was still with him . He could see the whole show from here . The sergeant , however , was by no means so well satisfied . A twowheeledcountry cart , begod , just where the column would have to make its first turn into the square , the first bloody thing the bloody general would see ! His remarks finally became too notable to be ignored . Being an Irishman , the sergeant involved the entire Holy Family in his profane view of the situation . " How be the Sweeney twins over at Pittsburgh , sergeant ? " asked Salathiel mildly . " Or do ye ever hear from there any more ? " The sergeant came closer , making his way through the crowd . " So , it 's yourself , " said he , " the little captain 's Injun boy turned country gintleman  --  and the captain 's mare , too ! " He looked at Frances appreciatively . He winked . " All right , keep your big mouth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye how it is ye 've lost an ear . " " Now , how did ye lose it , Sal ? " demanded Frances , throwing herself into the spirit of the occasion . The sergeant withdrew satisfied with the harm he thought he had done . Salathiel tied Enna firmly , child cd into the cart , and waited . Up the road the bagpipes and dramas ! woke out with " All the Blue Bonnets Came Over the Border . " The crowd roared and stared at the corner  --  where the cart was tied . The general 's music marched into the square first . The combined snare-drums of the returning regiments rounded the corner , rolling a wave of sound before them that drowned out the shrill fifes and squealing bagpipes behind them , and the roars of the delighted crowd . The drummers were ragged , hatless , and mostly boys , but they were veterans ; and they knew they were good . Their elbows all lifted together while their drumsticks shivered in a rhythmic mist . They stopped . The brass trumpets tossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd in the square was lifted clean off its feet . Some people began to try to dance and holler where they stood . Handkerchiefswere waved and fluttered at open windows all the way around the square . A happy breeze of feminine voices seemed to breathe through the place . Even little men began to bellow , and the staff horses pranced . The complicated rigadoon continued as the music ,  |p333drums  , fifes , bugles , and bagpipes , marched across the square to the south border , countermarched , and stood playing  --  more softly now  --  but ready to burst into new tunes and appropriate flourishes as each regiment or unit turned the corner of the stockade to march in review across the square . The massed weather-beaten , shot-torn , faded colours of the 42nd , 77th , and both royal regiments and Royal Americans and the flags of the Pennsylvania militia battalions appeared next . They were met by a respectful , but an eager and expectant silence , for everyone now craned his neck to see what came next . The drums flourished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees flashing , kilts and tartans flaunting , marched into the open space and passed before the commandant . The crowd cheered them wildly as one company after another flowed past to mass and ground arms at the north end of the square , where the music played . There were many people at Carlisle who remembered the highlanders , the forlorn hope of the frontier , leaving lonely and in the midst of terror and silence , with Bouquet at their head , only two summers before . The general 's complimentto the Highlanders was well understood and taken kindly . Even the backwoodsmen were vociferous , remembering how they had charged at Bushy Run . " What a pity it ca n't always be like this , " sighed Colonel Clayton , who had never found gratitude associated with buckskins before  --  " what a pity ! " It was only when the Highlanders began to march past them at the corner that Salathiel came fully to appreciate what a nice point of vantage accident and the Irish sergeant had conferred upon him . Sitting in the high-wheeled cart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces of the men in the marching ranks as they turned the corner . Now and then he recognized someone familiar . Ensign Erskine , a lieutenant now , and the four surviving Alexanders replied to his happy yell . Then the Royal Americans began to pass , the old companies from Fort Pitt . His hands and voice were kept busy . Even the captains gave him a pleasant nod . Well , well . . . they seemed to say , as they smiled and marched on . And now the general was coming . Yes , there was Buckey himself . He was riding a shaggy-looking little horse . He looked faded and war-worn . It was Captain Ourry who was acting adjutant . Bouquet must have brought him along from Bedford . But Ourry was never much on a horse , either . Why , the crowd did n't seem to realize who the general was ! Salathiel stood up in the cart and began to roar his name . The crowd caught on , the place rocked with cheers . Bouquet passed within ten feet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hat and roaring his name , with an amused smile . That terrible ragged ear  --  where had he seen it before ? . . . but yes ! His expression flashed into one of pleased recognition . He made a wide cordial gesture , he took off his hat and bowed in his saddle to Frances . The crowd began to cheer her . It was the proudest and happiest moment of her life . " Oh , Sal , " she gasped , " oh , Sal , he really knew ye . Yell be after takin ' me now to see him at headquarters , wo n't ye , Sal ? The grand , good man ! To think that we might have missed him ! Oh , I think I 'm really married to ye now . Now wo n't ye ... " " I 'll take ye , " he said . After that the rest of the procession was bound to be something of an anticlimax to the Albines , but not to the rest of the crowd . What they were most eagerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rods away , Salathiel saw Buckey being welcomed by the commandant . There was a deal of saluting and hatraising . People were stepping up to shake hands with the general : Colonel Armstrong , Mr. Craighead in a black skullcap , two or three other ministers , Mr. Arthur St. Clair , a string of well-dressed gentlemen , Mr. Edward Yates .... My , my , what a powwow ! Mr. Tilingham , the schoolmaster , pulled a paper out of his pocket and began to try to read a Latin address he had composed but had not had time to memorize , and against the bagpipes , too . Buckey finally patted him on the head like a big dog , and the committee and staff dissolved in laughter . The drums and bagpipes took over . The remnants of the 77th Royal were passing , veterans of campaigns from Cuba to the Ohio . But few people remembered that now . The big ovation , naturally enough , fell to the green-coated , brown , and buckskin-clad Pennsylvania battalions , especially to the Rangers , and the Light Infantry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the " country troops " . Only they were really coming home . Friends and relatives began to break through the line of redcoats that held the sidelines , and there was no stopping them . Wives , mothers , and sweethearts found their men . Lieutenant Pomeroy and his diary , his mother-in-law , and her daughter were there . But others were forever absent , and there were screams , cries of anguish mixed with cheers and laughter , and few dry eyes . With the return of the home troops the culmination was reached , and the military precision of the occasion began to disintegrate . At the corner of the square a hostile roar turned all heads in that direction , and rapidly bore down the din of cheering with a welcome of another kind . Three open ammunition wagons surrounded by a company of the 77th with fixed bayonets entered the square at a slow walk . A threatening silence gradually grew , and accompaniedp335them . Why was it , Salathiel wondered , that Indians in wagons always rode standing up ? But so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking straight ahead : chiefs , warriors , squaws , and a few children . Their eyes glittered . So did their beads and wampum finery . They held their coloured blankets close about them . There were a few cocked hats , red turbans , and turkey- and eagle-feather headbands among them , and these , together with their red wooden faces , all snapped forward or jerked backward together like turtle heads when the wagons jolted , stopped  --  and went on . A furious tempest of catcalls , laughter , jeers , threats , and imprecationsburst out from every side and accompanied the end of their stolid progress across the square . These were the Indians who would not be separated either by threats or cajolery from their beloved adopted captives . Despite all that Bouquet could do , they had followedthem and the army downcountry . Now , for their own protection , the general had loaded them into wagons , surrounded them by a hedge of bayonets , and was sending them to jail . Here and there lank-haired men in buckskins ducked under the arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wagons , yelling insults vociferously , and threatening to combine for mischief . But they were stopped cold by the hedge of bayonets . And the helpless contents of the wagons , despite roars of ridicule and protest , were safely lodged in jail . The grenadiers of the 77th immediatelysurrounded the building and prepared to camp there . Bouquet was taking no chances of another Paxtang massacre  --  and the renewal of the Indian war . Even at that , snatching so succulent a bone out of the jaws of the mountain wolves , as Bouquet put it , might have been a more serious matter than it proved , had it not been that there was no time left for the pack to gather about the prison , or for the snarling and growlingof those who considered themselves balked of their natural prey to gather head . The captivated now began to arrive amidst enormous tumult and excitement at the south end of the square . There was a universal rush in that direction , and the " children of the forest " were left temporarily forgotten to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in stony peace . A line of seventeen wagons interspersed with men , women , and children walking , or in a few cases mounted on the sorriest of nags , forced its way slowly into the crowd at the bottom of the square . They were preceded by the remains of Bouquet 's Virginia Rangers , whose use of rifle-butts on the toes and corns of the too curious , or frantic friends and relatives of the long expected Indian captives , caused them to be remembered vividly for many years  --  but also cleared the necessary space for the liberated to continue to breathe in , unload their dunnage , and encamp . The detachment of Royal Americansthat had marched beside them , a file on either side of the ragged and motley procession through the forests and over the mountains all the way from the western Ohio woods , was now withdrawn . But not without many tearful good-byes , blessings , and the clinging and howls of the young pets of the red-coated soldiers , many of whom had been " fathers " and " uncles " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rangers now took charge . The scene that ensued transcended the powers of several gentlemenof noble sentiment who afterward tried to describe it . Sentiment was not historically adequate ; basic emotions were involved and poignantly manifested . Ecstasy , pathos , tragedy , and dumb disappointmentwere epitomized . For a few poignant hours , about the seventeen wagons , all the emotions attributed to heaven , hell , or limbo found their genuine earthen mix . The long lost , the supposed dead returned . Children rushed screaming to throw themselves on the breasts of parents , whose features renewed themselves in life again out of the dwindling images of exiled dreams . Small daughters grown to be young women in the wilderness laid their cheeks darkened by far-western suns against the pale cheeks of their mothers and begged them to repeat the cherished music of their half-forgotten names  --  was it Jane or Annabelle or Sue ? The heloved tones of voices from the past renewed themselves . Shy orphans with scraggly feathers in their hair , their naked legs trembling under ragged blankets , were tearfully examined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were patted on the head sadly and left to stand waiting , trying to say something in English , muttering in Shawanee or Algonquin who they thought they were . Would Uncle Ed come ? Would Aunt Jessie know them ? What was the colour of mama 's hair ? " Me Smitty , me ' itty Yon Smitty , " one Saxon-looking child kept shouting . But none of the English Smiths , and , of course , they were there , knew him . Little Smitty eventually went home to the valley of Virginia with a big Ranger named Ed Tredigar . Old people , captured many years before , for the most part stood together . Time as well as war had lessened the chance of their being found again by kin . Most of their surviving friends they now saw amongst themselves . It was not likely that grandchildren would know them . And* Most of the Virginia riflemen who had accompanied Bouquet in the Ohio campaign had been dismissed at Fort Loudon and gone home to the " Valley " , taking many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " accompaniedhim to Carlisle , probably on account of difficulty in paying them off , an harassing affair for Bouquet . P337not many young people did stop to inquire . Only Lillian Johnson of Grand Island found her grandpa . She already had two children of her own holding onto her skirts ; but she had kept a small wooden fox grandpa had once whittled out for her . He hobbled off with her without looking back , a warm fireside before him and the cold misery of the forest behind . God , what a little wooden fox could do ! But the babies , the babies with Indian beads around their necks and small moccasins with porcupine quills in starry patterns on their small feet  --  there was a whole wagonful of babies  --  some standing up and some crawling around , under the care of two Scotch matrons and a couple of Shawano squaws . Bouquet had seen to that. * But the babies ? It was hard to know who and whose they were . Indeed , some of them never found out . There was a crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mothers . They had been scalped . Other women came around the wagon , crying , silent , talking together , wondering . People kept coming up and looking into the baby wagon , and then going away again . Some of the two- and three-year-olds were plausibly claimed . Gaunt women looked bloody death at the nursing squaws they envied , and walked away . All this for an hour or two in the late-afternoon sunlight , and then suddenly , for the fortunate , the era of captivity was over as early twilight came on . The claimable were claimed . They had gone on their way ; on their way home rejoicing . By twos or threes , by couples and families . Husbands and wives together again , strange with each other but shyly delighted , vouchsafed another honeymoon perhaps , or prayers again , kneeling down at the same bedside together . And there were lovers who walked away silently hand in hand , fond hope justified at last . A widow who had not found her husband came down off a porch on the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers into the hands of a slim girl dressed like Pocahontas . She was passing by on the arm of a young farmer , whose face was exalted with happiness . Mrs. Judith McCormick , the widow in the black dress , threw her arms about Marigold Cooper , the girl in deerskins , kissed her , and left the paper flowers in her hand . They were pathetic little fly-specked mantel blossoms . But they glowed there in the winter sunset , clutched in the fingers of lovely destiny , with the authentic radiance of undying fire . Up and down the tramped-out " streets " between the lonely wagons of the captivated that still waited glimmering whitely in the public square , those who had not found what they had come so hope-* These " matrons " were specifically allowed for in the general marching order for the organization of the expedition before its leaving Fort Pitt . Other women were excluded . The " nursing-squaws " were added as a necessity on the Muskingum . ... , ... M. :   fully looking for still stood talking together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could from one another out of desperate rumours of prisoners that were still to be returned from Canada or captives said to be gathering at the DeTroit . A few still wandered alone , or searched in desperate couples afraid to look at each other , hunting amid the wagons , peering into the faces of halfsavagechildren , asking questions , hoping against hope . A continual wailing now came from the baby wagon , one which was not easily to be assuaged . A number of forlorn-looking people , both men and women , stood about silently , crying dejectedly , watching . Captain Morgan now had the supper fires kindled and rations issued , after ascertaining that upwards of seventy people still remained unclaimed . He and his men , tall fellows in fringed buckskins , went about , unexpectedlyhelpful and gentle , carrying what comfort they could , and explaining with bashful embarrassment why it was necessary to tie up some of the captives , especially the younger ones  --  fist for the reason that as soon as yer back gits turned , they slip off like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Injuns that be waitin ' fer ' em .

He 's got the wilderness taste in his mouth and the forest look on his face . He 's jist plumb sullen . Ile wo n't he no good no more to nobody but himself , will ye , Tommy ? " The boy grunted . The Virginian passed on , the light irons and chains over his arm jingling . " Whar 's that sloeeyedgal now ? " He stuck his head inquiringly into a wagon . " She 's talkin ' to her buck over at the jail window , " replied a woman 's voice . " They 've allowed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to dance , and the shadows wavered on the wagon-tops . A Quaker brought two buckets of fresh foaming milk still warm from the cows , and gave them to an attendant squaw . " Thee will find it helpful , " he said . " Heap heap good , " grunted one of the nursing Indian crones . The babies began to quiet down . The Quaker stood watching the procedingsin the wagon contentedly . The small greedy noises he heard pleased him . The bucket yoke now rested lightly across his neck . There should be more milk in the morning , but he would take the two buckets home tonight . It was hard to get iron hoops in Carlisle . " A very sensible thing , Friend Tavistock , " said a quietly containedvoice just behind him . The Quaker turned slowly . Ile remembered just in time to keep his hat on . " Thee has a firm memory , Friend Bouquet , " he said .   " I seldom forget those who come to help the men in the hospitals , " replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to confuse me . It was at the City barracks in the Northern Liberties , if I rememberright . " " Yes , " said the Quaker . " Not many came to help there , ' t is true . But then the smallpox is always so catching  --  and that was many years ago . " " Nevertheless . . . " said Bouquet . They stood talking while Friend Tavistock waited for his buckets . The news that the brigadier was come amongst them spread rapidly . The unclaimed captives , the disappointed people who had not found their lost children or relatives , all who still lingered about the seventeen wagons and were waiting for supper , gathered about the big fire that crackled near the baby wagon , looking at the general , and the Quaker iii the brown coat he was talking with , curiously . The children and young people gradually edged forward . That was Buckey there , that was the great man who had brought them back over the mountains . They had seen the chiefs , the terrible fierce warriors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace pipe , squatting in the green arbours before him by the river-bank in the far Ohio woods . The long wampum belts had been laid across his knees while the soldiers stood behind him . Many fine speeches had been made . Buckey was strong and powerful . The king had sent him . But standing in the warm light of the dancing supper-fire he looked different . He looked tired and had a sad smile . Maybe he would help them now , if somebody would only ask him . Bouquet felt their eyes upon him , and turned . They were all looking at him . Bon Dieu ! Heaven knows he had not meant to make any speeches at Carlisle . Of Indian oratory and formal mouthings he had had a bellyful . For the past three months in particular , he had had to be nothing less than an oracle ; male Fate in a red coat . These people  --  he would have to talk with them . He beckoned to them to draw in closer about him , with a familiar personal word here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tomorrow , he said , they would all be moved out to the camp that had been prepared for them at LeTort 's Springs . I t had been a heroic march they had made over the mountains from Fort Pitt in the depth of winter . They had done well . Things would be better in the new huts at the camp . There they would no longer be exposed to the open weather . Let those who had not found their own dear people take heart . They might still find them  --  let them hope on and be patient . To those who had no place to go , and for the orphans , he would see that they were taken care of . There were many good people in Phila- delphia , at Lancaster , and in other towns and on farms , who would open their hearts and their homes to the captivated . Good men in the assembly and the governor himself had them in mind . Before he left the province he would promise them that everyone , great and small , should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had laid that upon his honour and upon his soul . For those who had been beguiled by their Indian captors and would return to the ways of the wilderness , he asked them to consider well what they were doing . They ought not to endanger their souls or repudiate their own people that way . Let them be patient and try to learn . He would ask them to do that for the sake of the brave men who had risked and lost their lives to bring them back . His voice ceased , but they still stood looking at him standing alone with drooping epaulets in the red firelight , the shadowy Quaker behind him . " Be ye goin ' to leave us , gineral ? " asked an old woman in a cracked voice , leaning on a stick . " The king hath commanded me to far southern parts , " he replied . " But I shall still be with you for a while . " A sigh went up from the circle . " God bless you , Buckey , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still they stood looking at him . It was indecently poignant , uncomfortable . What more could he say ? A five-year-old iii ragged deerskins and the fragment of a trade blanket walked out , sensing the feeling of general gratitude , and gravely shook hands with the general . Ile then presented him with his chief treasure . " Blow it , general . Now it , " the boy said , seeing the general was puzzled . Bouquet looked at his gift gravely . It was a long white willow whistle with two red-robin feathers t ied on little strings at the end . " It blows , " insisted the child . " Thank you , my boy , " said the brigadier . He put the whistle to his lips and blew hard . He puffed out his cheeks . A splendid squawkingsquall emerged from the thin tube . The red feathers danced forward in his breath . The crowd was delighted . They laughed and clapped happily and began to disperse for supper . The child retired , satisfied , and with the cherubic dignity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the firelight . What was that sententious phrase the schoolmaster had tried to repeat in his Latin speech , poor fellow ? A notable sonorous tag . . . Ante Tubam Trepidant . . . They tremble before the trumpet . A smile of exquisiteironic enjoyment twitched the great general 's lips . This , then , was the great moment of his triumph . P341He blew on the willow whistle long and hard ... . At the bare and quite unprepossessing headquarters in the camp at LeTort Springs , Captain Ourry already had all the marching orders for the regulars laid out on the table , ready to be signed . The Royal Americans and the 42nd were to march early next morning for Lancaster . Some of them were to go in wagons , and it was time to get the orders to the colonels . Also , it was long after suppertime . Captain Ourry was hungry . The clerks sat looking at him vacuously . Jesus , where in the name of the fifteen colonial governors was the general ? There was a rout at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there to answer the speeches . Under no considerationwas Ourry going to do that for him . At that moment the thin sound of a shrill whistle commenced to sound outside the barrack door . The three clerks sat up , and sat still like a lot of silly rabbits , with their plumes behind their ears , listening . The whistle continued . Now , there are some things which even an adjutant does n't have to stand for . Captain Ourry arose , upsetting his desk stool , and strode furiously towards the door . He flung it open indignantly ... . Salathiel and Frances had not joined the crowd in going to look at the captivated . For many reasons it would have been more than Salathiel could bear . Also he was afraid Frances might want to bring some babies home . They sat in the cart after the captivated passed and the crowd broke up about them , rather doubtful just what to do . It was in that way they saw what nearly everyone else had missed . Long after the rear-guard had passed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the square , a lone farm wagon appeared , pulled by a single sway-back nag . There were no less than five ministers seated in it . The Reverend James Mc Ardle and the Reverend Charles Puffin , the chaplain at Fort Bedford , were on the front seat , with the light of missionary inspiration playing about their devoted countenances . They looked over the heads o f the crowd in the square and into the future with a fixed and enthusiastic expression . Salathiel ducked . He found it necessary just then to be sure that Enna was firmly tied to her post . The wagon with its holy freight moved slowly forward and disappeared up the road on the other side of the square . Salathiel thought it just as well not to tell Frances who and what had passed . A few minutes later , while they were discussing whether to gop342back to the mill immediately or not , they were interrupted by the familiar voice of Yates , who stood with his hand resting on the side board and looking up at them quizzically . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim Fergus , " he said . " Do n't you think it would be a good idea to come across the square to the Williamses ' and spend the night there ? Mrs. Williams says she 'll make room in her own bed for Mistress Albine . You and I , Sal , can roll up in our cloaks in the back hall . It wo n't be so bad , and I really think you 'd better come and talk over the Glen affair . Besides , this will be a memorable night in Carlisle , you know . Bouquet has come home  --  and the war 's over . I suppose you 'll be wanting to make plans for moving to the City now . " " That 's about the size of it , " replied Salathiel . P343Applewood and Sealing WaxIT IS DFFINITELY a pity that the title of " counsellor " , rather than that of " attorney-at-law " , was not the usage of the bar of the Province of Pennsylvania before which Edward Hamilton Yates , Esquire , had the honour to practise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly at law , in one way or another , it was as a counsellor in the art of conducting life 's more serious affairs in general rather than arguing legal cases in particular that he most shone as a lawyer . And Yates 's success in this advisory and admonitory capacity , by far the larger aspect of the legal profession 's relevancy , was due not alone to a technical knowledge of the law and statutes which applied in any given case or situation , but also to a fine sense of justice both innate and cultivated , a professional instrument which at best he sharpened by practice and employed with ever hopeful tact , and at worst applied with a merciful politeness . Add to this , the peculiar flavour of his amused and amusing charm , his discerning and disarming smile , and his singular eye ; and it was difficult for most people not to accede to , or at least to acquiesce in , any points of law , equity , or logic which he undertook to defend or promote by his dapper and fearless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to his subtle method of clearing the primrose path of his opponents of any minor obstacles that promised to hinder them in going their own determined way to the Bonfire , so that the snares that they had rigged for others frequentlyengaged their own feet ; while several learned judges and numerous ignorant juries were from time to time persuaded into the opinion that if God and the legislature were not both on Mr. Yates 's side , it could only be due to the fact that the wisdom of the Former was superhuman by definition and the acts of the latter known to be fallible . As a friendly adviser then , rather than as an advocate , Mr. Yates was like a compass whose true north was the opposite pole of folly . Not occasionally it did take both courage and intelligence to follow his counsels , but few who took his advice were ultimately disappointed . All of which might be summed up in Salathiel 's homely remarkthe morning after Brigadier Bouquet 's arrival at Carlisle , to the effect that Ed Yates was a damned good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of friendly virtue . Certainly , the results of the morning were good warrant for Salathiel 's assertion , for the affairs of the Albines , which to themselvesat least had lately seemed confused and entangled , were straightened out in a manner that seemed little short of magical to Salathiel , and finally forced even Frances to revise her estimate as to the practical value of having a lawyer and a good friend actually in and about the house . Even while they were washing together , stripped to the waist , under the frosty water that fell from Mr. Williams 's pump , early that morning , Yates had after a manner cross-questioned Salathiel . And while they were having their bacon , eggs , hominy , and small beer together later on , he had arrived at certain conclusions as to the exact items which , in his opinion , it was advisable to cope with in order to relieve Salathiel 's perplexities and settle the Glen estate . The neatness and economy of two birds at one shot appealed to him . Most of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife kept repeating in a kind of matrimonial chorus the , to them , still perplexing and expensive details of Mr. Glen 's mysterious demise . But while Yates picked over his victuals he also , without anyone 's noticing it , picked over what brains there were present , and arose from his breakfast refreshed by certain salient points in an otherwise trivial conversation . These he reserved for further consideration . For it was Yates 's custom , after breakfast , to retire to his chamberand , after locking his bedroom door , to go through a bit of physical and mental ritual there which had to do with two worlds , this and the other one . First , he cleaned his teeth with a furred sassafras stick and Eccles ' Powder of Desiccated Pearls . Then he carefully attended to his left eye , washing the empty socket and the smooth stone Surgeon Boyd had given him to keep in it , in an emollient elixir . After which he tied a fresh black eye-patch securely in place . After that he shaved and did his hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , and dressed himself carefully , keeping in mindp345the visible weather and the probable business of the day . He then pulled all the bed-clothes into the middle of the bed , provided he was staying overnight , so that the servant would have to make the bed up new . After which he knelt down , usually over a chair , and addressed a prayer to the Father of Mankind , which somehow , to his own mind at least , although it was often wordless , embodied a plea for continued mercy , an act of gratitude and contrition , and a hope for the continuance of a sound body and a clear mind . In all of this it must be remembered that out of set habit he moved with the greatest celerity and economy of motion . His mental preliminaries for the day , on the other hand , were more leisurely . They usually consisted in setting down in a diary in brief Latin sentences the events of the day before , together with such items of accounting and other factual reminders as he deemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keenly the probableeffects of the events of the previous day upon the one which lay immediately before him , and thus having summed up the past and anticipated the immediate future as well as he could , he made his final preparations for the campaign of the next twelve hours , accordingly . These always consisted in putting into or taking out of his leather trunk , which invariably accompanied him , such articles , books , documents , and notes as the exigencies of the current day required , and transferring them to his portfolio which closed with a silver hasp engraved with the ducal arms of the House of Hamilton . He then put his watch , his keys , and the necessary change to see him through the day into his waistcoat pockets , and assuring himself he had not left anything behind or anything of value loose in the room , he locked his trunk , put on his cloak and neat cocked hat , opened the window to air out the chamber if the weather permitted , and descended the stairs . On the particular morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead of going downstairs immediately after locking his trunk , he sat down at a small dressing table , and extracting some foolscap from his portfolio , carefully sketched in and then wrote out in fair-hand three formal statements which he felt would hold good in law , to wit : a lease embodying a waiver as a preliminary agreement , a form of indenture for a minor child , and an agreement between certain parties for the hiring and subsistence of a slave . Having checked these for correct phraseology against a volume that always accompanied him , Cunningham 's Law Dictionary , he placed that useful tome back in the trunk together with Blackstone'sCommentaries and Taylor 's Elements of Civil Law , etc. , etc. , and again locked the large leather travelling valise , for such it was ,
