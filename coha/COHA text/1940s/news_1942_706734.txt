txt Failure to control the whole interwoven network of prices and wages is threatening to add billions of dollars of unnecessary cost to the nation 's war effort , Leon Henderson , Federal Price Administrator , told the Senate Banking and Currency Committee today in testifying in behalf of the immediate passage of the Administration 's anti-inflation bill . If farm prices are permitted to reach levels permitted under the Price Control Act ? an act which would be amended by the new cost-of-living bill ? it would heap approximately $2,03600,000 to the prices of farm prolaucts marketed in 1942 , Mr. Henderson declared . Wage increases , he said , are similarly imperiling the Government 's price ceilings because they are costs and their continued rise " inevitably pushes prices higher . " The chief of the 0 . P. A. described a repulse of inflation as much a part of defeating the enemy in this war as a repulse of an invasion of the American coast . War Program Periled He characterized the inflationary threat as being " as deadly as a bomb and as treacherous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war program , " he added . Mr. Henderson opened the Government 's case for the anti-inflation legislation introduced yesterday by Senator Prentiss W. Brown ( D ) of Michigan and Senator Robert F. Wagner ( D ) of New York , authorizing and directing the President to stabilize every item in the cost of living , including wages and farm prices , as nearly as possible at levels prevailing on Aug. 15 last . On wages Mr. Henderson said : " Wage increases , when not accompanied by a corresponding increase in production are inflationary for two principal reasons : first . they increase labor costs , and thus cause pressure against price ceilings . For several months in the war effort , higher wages could be absorbed because of the higher levels of production , which reduced unit cost . That happy situation is no longer present in most American industries . Unit Labor Costs " From Jan. 1 , 1941 to May , 1942 unit labor costs have increased by an average of 1.1 per month . In the months to come , I look for unit labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wage rates , what with the loss of younger and skilled workers , introduction of less skilled labor , inevitable transportation and other delays . " Mr. Henderson added that an effect of higher wages was the pressure of more purchasing power . Dollars , he said , become plentiful while goods get scarcer . " The spectacle to marvel at is not that prices and the cost of living are going up , " he explained . " It is spectacular that the overwhelming flood of dollars have not burst the darn wide open . " It was Mr. Henderson 's judgment that uncontrolled items are forcing up the whole cost of living , " For example , " he pointed out , " from the middle of May to the middle of August uncontrolled food items advanced 9 8 per cent in contrast to controlled foods which dropped .3 per cent ; the increase in uncontrolled foods , which ran at a rate of 40 per cent per year , was responsible for practically all of the increase in the cost of living during that period , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the entire food budget of an average American family . " As specific instances of what I mean , take the i ise in butter prices of 8 per cent during the one month , . July 15 to Aug. 15 . During the same month egg prices advanced 12 per cent ; roasting chicken Li per cent and , it should be noted , that these increases were ' much larger than the usual seasonal advances . Since Aug. 15 , the daily market reports show that the uncontrolled food prices have continued the upward swing . " Effect on Morale Mr. Henderson argued that cost of living increases have an effect on morale , make people think about getting higher wages or higher prices , and thus " the evil is compounded . " Brown-Warner Version The Administration is centering its support upon the Brown-Wagner version of the anti-inflation program because , to its temporary dismay , at least , Representative Henry B. Steagall ( D ) of Alabama , Chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee , introduced a companion measure in the lower chamber which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Steagall , revealing himself more of an ally of the above-parity farm bloc than of the Administration anti-inflation policy , offered a measure which its opponents believe would contribute to inflation instead of curbing it . The bill , which Mr. Steagall said he hoped to have passed by the House next week , would : Require the Government through a system of loans to put a 100 per cent parity price floor under all six basic commodities  --  cotton , corn , wheat , rice , tobacco and peanuts  --  and under any non-basic commodities whose production the Government wants increased . Alter the formula by which parity prices are computed so as to create a further rise in the permissible ceilings on farm prices . Responsibility Place upon President Roosevelt exclusive responsibility for any alteration in farm price ceilings from those prescribed in the price control act . Mr. Steagall said the farm price " fluor " provision would " probably bring farm prices up to parity , " but that he had no data as to its effect on living costs or as to its cost to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared for an eventual compromise on the " floor " provision . It Was reported yesterday that a " floor " at 90 per cent of parity was their objective . Existing law provides a system of crop loans designed to put an 85 per cent of parity " floor " under the six basic crops . The measure is so worded as to make its 100 per cent " floor " automatically applicable to all those basic crops and to any non-basic farm products for which the Secretary of Agriculture " finds it necessary to encourage the expansion of production . " The Steagall bill proposes to add the costs of farm labor to the formula for computing farm price parity , apparently without controlling farm wage rates . The farm bloc has been lighting for this proposal for years , but there was no indication whether the Roosevelt Administration would accept it to sweeten for this group the bitter pill of control of thrill prices . Representative Steagall agreed that by this provision the prices of many farm commodities " must necessailly " rise above their present levels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probable point to ' which specific crop prices might rise .
