Couple of months ago , aureoled Leopold Stokowski got the U. S. Army to let him tinker with a military band at Fort MacArthur , Calif . Shortly Maestro Stokowski proclaimed that martial music should be rescored , chiefly with more saxophones ; that Army bands should be sent into battle in tanks and armored cars , tootling the while . Last week the American Bandmasters ' Association , meeting in Madison , Wis. , officially resolved that Dr. Stokowski should mind his talk : he was " incapable of speaking with authority on bands . " <P> The U. S. band which speaks for itself with the most authority is one at Fort Ontario , in Oswego , N. Y. There the 369th anti-aircraft regiment , a Negro National Guard unit from Harlem , is having a year 's training . The men of the 369th get more from their band than most regiments do . Almost every night they hear a jam session , almost hot enough to melt the icicles on the recreation barracks . The band 's leaders are Sergeant Reuben B. Reeves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Redman 's orchestras . <P> Bandmaster of the 369th for more than four years has been Russell Wooding , onetime Broadway arranger and conductor , onetime bandmaster for the New York Giants football team . Bandmaster Wooding works his men hard , says : " All of us realize that we have a great tradition to uphold . " That tradition was begun in World War I , when the 369th was the crack 15th New York Infantry and its bandmaster was the late James Reese Europe . <P> In the early 1900s , when Northern popular musicians played only potted-palm tunes , big , black , Alabama-born Jim Europe held Negro jam sessions in a cafe in West 53rd Street . White folks dropped in , hired so many of Europe 's friends to play " gigs " - single party dates - that Jim opened a booking office . He formed a Clef Club of Negro jazzmen , gave a concert in Carnegie Hall in 1911 . He ( at the piano ) and his boys played for Vernon and Irene Castle . Once he excited the Castles ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-step . That , said Jim Europe and his friends , was how the fox trot started . <P> In 1917 Jim Europe and his manager , Noble Sissle ( Shuffle Along ) , joined the 15th Regiment . The colonel made Europe band leader , raised $10,000 for instruments - 30 reeds , a dozen or so brasses , two bull fiddles ( for concerts ) . Leader Europe became a lieutenant , Sissle his drum major and top sergeant . The two of them were soon putting riffs in conventional marches , had the band blare blues to a fare-thee-well . When the 15th reached France , Europe 's band was detailed to play for U. S. soldiers just back from the front lines . <P> Mustered out of the 15th Jim Europe picked up a band , played at Manhattan Opera House , went on tour billed as Jim Europe and His Hell Fighters Band . In Boston , near the end of the tour , he had an altercation with Herbert Wright , broth ' er of his drummer . Wright pulled a knife , slashed Europe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , Jim Europe said : " Sissle , carry on as I have outlined , " and died .
