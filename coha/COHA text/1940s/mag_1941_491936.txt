January 18,1941 MR . J. W. JOHNSON , the famous wild- animal dealer , was complaining about the 1 . shortage of dragons . " We used to get a number of them from the mountainous regions in Southern Mexico , " he told my wife and me . " But this year there 's been so much threat of revolution , it 's almost impossible to get a shipment through . I ca n't say that I blame the trappers much , either . They have a tough enough job as it is , without having to worry about politics . " My wife said mildly , " I had no idea there really were dragons , Mr. Johnson . " But she said it in the tone of one who no longer could be surprised at anything . We had been married scarcely three months , but even in that short length of time she had seen weird and wonderful things arrive at our house in shipping crates or peer up at her out of the bathtub in the mornings . My hobby was keeping and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ f riends once remarked , " Cometo the M an nixes ' to have your D. T. 's . Everything 's provided . " Mr. Johnson laughed . " ' Dragons ' are what animal dealers call the giant South American iguanas . It 's a good namt ' for ' em too . You know , some iguanas get to be six feet long , and they 're terrible fighters . They can run like rabbits and bite like bulldogs . The natives say about the only thing that can outdistance them is a bird . " " Then why do n't you take some of your hawks down and try to catch them , Dan ? " asked my wife brightly . Mr. Johnson and I laughed and shook our heads . I am very fond of falconry and have kept and flown hawks for the last ten years . A friend and I spent one summer in the mountains of Wyoming hunting with goshawks , and I have seen a two-pound hawk grab a ten-pound jack rabbit and attempt to hold him down . But I knew well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the terrible dragon iguanas that even a powerful man would find a dangerous enemy . " Jule , I 'm afraid even my goshawk would be outclassed there , " I had to admit to my wife . " I 've seen those iguanas bite a stick . They just lock their jaws and wo n't let go . About the only bird that could make any impression on them would be an eagle . " " Then , " said Jule with simple feminine logic , " why not get an eagle ? " Again we laughed , but Jule 's remark started me thinking . On the face of it , the idea seemed impossible . Eagles are the largest , the strongest and the most difficult to handle of all the birds of prey . Comparatively few have ever been trained , even in the Middle Ages when falconry was the king of sports . Those that have been " manned , " as a falconer would say , have been almost all young birds taken from the nest . But the nesting season was over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an adult bird , take him three thousand miles in a car with us to Southern Mexico , take him on pack trips into mountains , train him to catch these giant , savage lizards , and finally bring him back another three thousand miles to Philadelphia  --  with the lizards . It is inadequate to say that it was a feat no one had ever before attempted . It was a feat no one had ever before dreamed of attempting . But Jule was willing to take the chance . So I set about trying to find an eagle . Eagles are not easy birds to secure . They are not common and they are not easy to catch . With the exception of the very rare sea eagle , there are only two species found in the United States  --  the golden eagle and the American eagle . Of these two types , I cared to tackle only the golden eagle . As far as I know , the American eagle had been tamed only once , by Captain Knight , the famous English falconer . Captain Knight obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained her . But the bird proved so fierce and sullen that he later presented her to the London Zoo . The golden eagle is far easier to handle and I thought I would have enough trouble without picking out the most irascible bird of prey on record . But after several weeks of writing to trappers and dealers , I still had not got my eagle . Then I was told that Mr. Thompson , of Salem , New Jersey , had an eagle he had caught some time before during a sleet storm . The eagle was strong and in perfect health , but he was completely untamed  --  and he was an American eagle . Jule and I talked it over and decided to take a chance . We motored down to Salem and met Mr. Thompson and his son . They told me they had made two attempts to free the bird , but he had grown used to people and refused to leave the town . He was kept in an old chicken house with a wire front and they would be glad to let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be trained for falconry . Bellicose Bird B UT the moment Jule and I saw the huge bird , we knew he was the eagle for us . He looked fierce , it was true , but he had none of the hangdog sullenness that is so typical of caged birds of prey . When we first saw him he was playing with an old corncob , tossing it about and catching it Iike a puppy . I guessed he had a wing spread of somewhat more than five feet and stood about three feet high . It still remained to see whether he was a hunter . Poor little Wriggles , Jule 's cairn puppy , had the unfortunate distinction of demonstrating this . With wagging tail and a heart full of friendship , Wriggles trotted over to the henhouse and stuck her trusting nose between the wires . With a crash that rocked the whole rickety structure , a feathered projectile smashed into the chicken wire . Wriggles fled like a rag on the wind , and we felt we had a bird that would close with anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a battle that was strongly suggestive of Sindbad the Sailor 's meeting with the roc , Mr. Thompson and I managed to get the eagle into a sack , Jule and I drove back to Philadelphia with him , feeling both triumph and apprehension as we listened to the noises that were going on inside the bag . That evening I put jesses on the huge bird . A hawk intended for falconry can never be kept in a cage , as beating against the bars ruins both her spirit and her feathers . Instead , she is secured by two short leather straps , one on each leg , called jesses . Through holes in the ends of these jesaes a swivel is passed , and then a leash through the swivel . If the bird is restless , the falconer covers her head with a hood that blinds her eyes . Curiously enough , this instantly quiets her . When the bird is ready to be flown , the swivel and leash are slipped away and the hawk unhooded . The jesses are never removed , even when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this bird turned out to be very like putting jewels on a dive bomber in action . By the time he was safely hooded and quiet on his perch , I was bleeding from half a dozen gashes in my arm as well as two deep holes into which a lead pencil could have been inserted . I knew that at this rate it would take at least a month to train him , and we could not waste that much time . Jule and I talked it over and agreed to leave for Mexico at once , taking our chances of manning the fierce bird on the way . Fortunately , I had gone , the week before , to see the Mexican consul and explained to him what we hoped to do with the eagle . He was most gracious and assured me he would attend to all details . So it was with confidence that Jule and I packed the car and started off one morning , planning to drop in at the consulate and pick up the necessary papers . ( Continued on Page 301 was light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders and hind action and that of the other dog . And then , in a few minutes , the judge was lining them along the rail in front of Hilda . Hilda was moving her lips . She had forgotten to look up at the judge now , and Vingie was leaning her chin on her small fists . But all at once Vingie looked up to meet Pete 's eyes , as if she had known all along just where he was in that big hall . Her whole face was shining , as if she knew everything was going right . And it was . Mr. Harned stepped back and picked up some ribbons . He came toward the first dog in the line , but turned toward Durfee , who had Bess in the second place , and handed him the blue ribbon . And there was a moment of silence round the ring , and then Hilda started clapping , and she yelled , " Hurray for you , Durfee I " But Durfee did n't look at her . He had to take Bess out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stall when he got there with Bess . Durfee was all right now . He had let blood , so to speak , and the pressure was off him . " Here , son , " he said to Pete , handing him the ribbon . " Stick it up on the wall so it will show . " VII LL , that was the beginning for Corporal Bess . She took the " American-bred bitches " and the " open , bitches " with no trouble at all , and the " winners ' bitches , " and Mr. Harned then kept her in the ring for the dogs to come in , and the judging started for " best of breed . " That was when Protector 's Knight Furious came up against her . When Pete saw him walk in , his heart sank . The clog looked like something extra when he was moving . He had to lean his chin on his hands , which were holding onto the ring rail to keep himself from sliding off his seat . Even Hilda was quiet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At last we were ready to go . Wriggles was coming along , also , she and the eagle having made a temporary truce . The eagle had learned to ride on his bar fastened across the back of the sta-tion wagon and was acquiring the trick of swaying with the motion of the car . could be put through . tell he fancies her . But Furious is a great dog . There 's no mistake about him . . . . Oh , you 're the Tillotson boy , are you ? " he said to Pete . " Pleased to meet you , son . . . . I 'm no expert , though ; I do n't know the breed so well . But you 've got a typy bitch . " He had moved back into the audience and started talking to some other reporters . Pete felt a gulp in his chest . He could hardly bear to stay where he was . He wanted to run right out of the hall . But he could n't , so he looked at the Earl dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anything , a little thing . But he could n't see it . The dog had style in the ring , he knew how to show . He was all nerve and dash , and if there was a tendency to fret , the handler in the leggings seemed to know how to make the most of it . Coming after him , Durfee , Pete thought , looked slow . He did n't even seem to be showing Bess ; it almost looked as if she were taking him around . And the judge kept them walking . Then Pete saw Senator Barnedice , and the senator winked at him across the ring and raised his hand a little bit . But it did n't make Pete feel better . Durfee had said , just before he brought Bess into the ring , " I think there 's something wrong with that dog . I wish I knew what , Pete . What time is it ? " Pete had looked at the clock . " It 's about twenty-five minutes to noon , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make up his mind too soon , that might be something . " And now it seemed to Pete that Durfee , in his slow way , was making the judging drag out . It was hard to bear . He seemed not to understand Mr. Harned 's instructions . Times he was on the wrong side of Bess , or got in the way , so Harried could n't get a clear look at Bess and the Earl dog together . It made the other handler smile in a patronizing way , so Pete began , for the first time in his life , to feel ashamed of wavin ' when that thing hits the border . " But in Mexico , keeping the eagle with us grew increasingly more difficult . Most of the Mexican hotels had rules against having dogs and cats in the hotel rooms . True , the rules said nothing about eagles , but , even su , the and told him . Pete remembered what the senator had said about the blueprint dogs from the big-city kennels . Maybe Furious had never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and premium slips . And Furious handler was nervous , somehow . He was n't grinning at Durfee condescendingly any more ; he was working over Furious , keeping him in his pose , a little rough with his hands , too ; and , behind Furious , Bess stood there with that warm , tranquil look in her eyes , and Durfee was standing in front of her , kind of grinning , with the lead dangling in his big hand . Pete could n't stand it . He reached for something , and it turned out to be Vingie 's hand . He clamped onto it till she drew her breath , but she did n't try to let go . And for once , as the judge came forward toward them with the ribbons , Hilda was hushed . The judge was sorting them . He had the blue in his hand , and it seemed as if he were reluctant . But Pete 's heart sank to see him hold it out , and to see the automatic forward gesture of Mr. Earl 's handler . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in the picture . That was that . And then the noon gun went off down the block . Just one report . But that was all it needed . Belcastle Protector 's Knight Furious of Doneagle lost his pose . He cowered for an instant , then he gave a frenzied yelp as his handler jumped for him too late . It was much too late . Furious had taken the railing in a bound , right against Hilda 's corner seat . Hilda let out a screech and whirled and threw herself at him . She got him by the tail just as he was burrowing at the knees of a couple of onlooking men . She held him for a minute before he shut up ki-yiing and went limp , and the handler came forking his legginged legs over the rail and took him by the scruff and dragged him away . back . Mr. turned to and was she went and was made no pumping was count-Hat ? let Vingie and Bess . she 's a good was that the carry the and with-in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the forced . One for only a few minutes , but when he returned , it was not only completely gutted but the robbers had actually put blocks under the wheels and removed the tires . " It was the only quick and efficient job I 've everknown Mexicans to do , " he told ( Continued on Pao 40 ) ( Continues ! from Page J8 ) us sadly . But during the five months we were in Mexico we never locked the car and never lost a thing . True , we piled everything in the back and had the eagle sitting on top of it . That might have had something to do with it . Especially as everything detachable on the outside was stripped off in the first hour , even including the little screw-on tube caps on the tires . Following the list of instructions Mr. Johnson had written out for us , we traveled south from Mexico City and made our headquarters in the little mountain town of Taxco . Taxco is built on the side of a cliff and is a maze of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balconies . In the center of town , on the only level spot of land in Taxco , stands the great cathedral , banked on every side by the little red-roofed houses , peering over each other 's shoulders to get a glimpse of the huge mother church . For the summer Jule and I rented a house with a little garden caught up in the cleft of the hill that made us feel as though we were living in a penthouse . From our garden we could look out over miles of mountain peaks . The nearer hills were covered with a fine tracery of white threads which , through a telescope , resolved themselves into ancient burro trails , old when Cortes conquered the land . The hills around Taxed are rich in silver and sometimes we would see the pack trains crawling down the terrible slopes , the little burros looking no bigger than mice . Each donkey carried his load of silver ore , just as their ancestors had carried it for the Spanish conquistadors four hundred years ago . We stopped many of these trains and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were iguanas hack in the hills . But they were hard to catch . They were " may braro , " very fierce . But , the drivers explained with a touch of condescension , the primitive mountain Indians would know where to find them . They even killed and ate them . The big lizards were said to taste very like chicken . The Mythical Iguana Hunters But where were these mountain Indians ? Well , the drivers were all very vague about this important point . They explained to us that they were sophisticated city dwellers , so , naturally , the movements of these backward hill tribes were a complete mystery to them . Unfortunately , no matter how far we penetrated into the hills , each village took the same view . The primitive Indians always lived in the next village across the ridge . But that village always turned out to consider it-. self a very progressive Community . They knew nothing about such barbaric customs as iguana hunting . Then one day while wandering over a mountain slope near Taxco , Jule and I met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; heaven knows I was never able to pronounce it . We called him " John " and let it go at that . Chon was twelve years old and stood some four feet high on his bare brown legs . When we met him , he and another boy were herding goats on the almost perpendicular slope of the cliff . Yes , Chon knew where there were iguanas and would lead us to the place when we had the aguila trained . Apulia is Spanish for eagle and by the time we had left Taxco , we were calling the great bird Aguila too . At last it became his name . We promptly hired Chon as house-boy for the magnificent sum of fifty cents a week . Then I set about train- ing Aguila . The eagle had tamed down sufficiently so that he would accept meat from my fingers , although he sometimes tried to get a finger also as a kind of bonus . My first step in training him was to carry Aguila on my gloved fist continually for several days . By the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were ready to fall off . Eagles are not so heavy as they look , ? guila weighed only ten pounds , but even ten pounds is a lot to carry on a half-bent arm all day , especially when the ten pounds are fighting mad . Like all birds of prey , eagles have hollow bones and most of their bulk lies in their feathers and enormous wings . Eagles are nothing but a powerful set of talons and a huge beak , transported from place to place by giant pinions. diguila 's Homework After a week during which I had to wear goggles to keep Aguila from removing one of my eyes , the great eagle quieted down . The next step was to teach him to fly to my fist for meat . This is probably the most difficult step in training hawks . With Aguila it was doubly difficult because the bird was so big it was difficult for him to take off , just as a big bombing plane has more trouble leaving the ground than a light pursuit ship . He usually had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could rise . Finally I hit on the device of flying him down the slope of a hill , so he would have the force of gravity in his favor . During this preliminary training , Aguila had a long , light rope tied to his jesses , technically called a creance . Jule had the other end of the creance tied around her body , and when Aguila made a bolt for the distant hills , she served as a brake to force him to drop hack to earth . It took three weeks of hard work before we dared permit Aguila to fly free . During this period of training , I had taken several trips into the hills to see the iguanas . Chon pointed them out to me ; great black lizards averaging three and four feet long . We would see them about noon , lying out on the rocks , sunning themselves . They seemed to he made of steel and whipcord , for several of them escaped us by jumping off the side of fifty-foot cliffs to land on solid rack . And they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But slowly the great eagle was becoming trained . Usually , a falconer is content to have his hawk " lure trained . " A lure is a leather bag some six inches or so in diameter . At one end is attached a long rawhide line . Meat is tied to the lure , and the falconer swings it around his head by means of the line . A hawk can see this contrivance at a great distance and when the falconer throws it into an open space , the bird flies down , lights on the lure , and the man can take her up while she is eating the meat . But on these mountain cliffs there frequently were no open spaces . I knew it would often be necessary to call the bird to me while I was hanging on to the side of a rock . So Aguila had to be trained to come to my gloved fist , and to come at once , no matter how far away he might be . To do this , the bird first had to learn perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is not so . Flying is a difficult and complicated process . A bird must learn how to use air currents for soaring , must understand how to angle for air with its wings , must know how to bank , power-dive , roll , zoom and take off and land in relation to the wind . A bird that does not know these things is as clumsy as a puppy learning to walk . For more than two thousand years , falconers have known that a bird flown during the middle of the day simply soars away and will not return to the lure . No one knew why  --  until the invention of the airplane . Airplane pilots have discovered that at noon warm , rising air currents make it difficult for a plane to land . A bird that gets caught in them finds it almost impossible to return to its master . Because of Aguila 's great size , his principal trouble was learning how to alight . He would come to my fist from a quarter of a mile away , but by the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not stop . In spite of this , he would grab my gloved fist as he hurtled by , and the result was dramatic , but hardly pleasant . I had no wish to have Aguila play this little prank while I was clinging to the side of a precipice by my fingernails , so he and I spent long hours of practicing . First , Aguila learned to swing away if he found he was going too fast , and then comeback in an easy curve to my hand . Later , he found that by dropping slightly just before he reached me , and then backing hard with both wings , he could brake his descent very nicely , and alight so gently on my fist that both he and I remained on our feet after the maneuver was completed . During these daily expeditions with Aguila , one fact was becoming more and more painfully apparent . It would be a physical impossibility for anything except a gorilla to carry Aguila into the hills where the lizards lived and still be able to crawl around rocks to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horse and train it and the eagle together . Then Aguila could be flown from horseback . Hawks of all kinds were hunted from horseback during the Middle Ages and we saw no reason why an eagle could n't he . But the first few horses we tried saw every reason . The minute they saw Aguila come rushing toward them , his enormous pinions thrashing the air , the wind whistling through his feathers , his long yellow feet thrown out before him , the horses suddenly remembered an important engagement they had elsewhere . Jule was a very expert horsewoman , and to her fell the questionable distinction of training the horses . She was plucky and skillful with the terrified animals , but after a while even she had to admit there were some things a horse would n't do , and letting an eagle land on him was one of them . Teresa 's flwakening When we were almost ready to give up , we acquired Teresa . Teresa was a wise old mare , formerly the property of a Mexican general . She had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad back , and been stolen twice . Nothing could surprise Teresa any more . Nothing , that is , except having an eagle flown from her . Teresa did not actually bolt when she saw Aguila headed her way at some fifty miles per hour , but she showed the whites of her eyes and walked around on her hind legs , something she had not done for years. , But at the end of a few days she and Aguila had got used to each other and Jule announced she was ready to try Teresa on the treacherous mountain trails . At last , after a month 's hard work , we were ready to begin . Our first attempts were disappointing . I had not taken into consideration one of the best-known characteristics of birds of prey . They can not see a motionless object . I have often seen a pigeon escape a falcon by dropping into a field and remaining motionless while the puzzled hawk beat the air above her . For this reason , falconers use dogs to keep the quarry in the air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about as long as a small dog . We had seen him before , and he always bolted up a long , gravelly slope that gave a pursuing bird a good chance at him . Jule " struck " the eagle 's hood  --  that is , she loosened the drawstrings so that it could be snatched off in a second  --  and we rode cautiously forward . The Flying Lizard When we were still a long distance away , the lizard rose to his deceptively short legs and began to show signs of apprehension . His forked tongue flickered in and out as he tasted the breeze , for lizards , like snakes , " hear " with their tongues . Apparently they are either able to pick up sound vibrations or else capable of sensing odors in the wind . In either case , long before we were in proper flying distance , this lizard became alarmed . He began to slide off his rock , but he still moved slowly , with frequent halts . This was the moment to cast off the eagle . Jule pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional falconer 's cry of " Gaze Ho ! " Aguila crouched his head down between his hunched wings and turned his wonderful telescopic eyes on the hills . He could have seen a rabbit two miles away  --  a mov-ing rabbit . But he could not see the lizard in plain sight at two hundred yards . There was nothing to do but ride forward . Jule touched Teresa with the spur and the mare trotted toward the iguana , picking her way daintily over the loose rocks . For a second the lizard squatted down like a rabbit freezing . Then without warning he flashed up the slope . Before Jule could throw him off her fist , Aguila had launched into the air . For a few precious seconds his great wings beat the mountain breeze while he hung almost motionless . Then slowly he overcame his initial inertia and shot away after the lizard . Unfortunately , the iguana had not waited patiently for the end of these maneuvers . He was speeding up the slope so fast his long body seemed to be a flickering shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fast as the reptile was moving , he seemed to he standing still compared to the meteoric flight of the bird . But still he had a lung lead . Jule and I stopped breathing as the giant eagle swiftly overhauled the fleeing lizard . The iguana was almost at the top of the slope now . Aguila suddenly reversed his wing strokes and , flinging his terrible yellow legs out before him , shot in for the kill . Just as he did so , the lizard reached the top of the cliff . Below him was a sheer drop of sixty feet onto merciless rock ledges . The iguana never paused . He rushed straight out into space , his speed actually carrying him a foot or s9 into mid-air before he began to fall . Aguila cast up , zoomed up in a sharp curve , ( Continued on Page 43 ) ( Continued from Page 41 ) turning- his head to watch the falling reptile . Then , keeping his wings rigid , he dropped sideways down the side of the cliff , cutting the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late . The iguana hit the rock , his feet beginning to move while he was still in the air , and darted into the mouth of a cave . When , after half an hour of climbing , I had reached the spot , Aguila was standing on a boulder looking into the black pocket and the iguana was gone . Our first attempt had failed . For a week Jule and I carried Aguila into the mountains every day , and every day the eagle continued to make futile attempts to catch the swift lizards . Finally it was through Wriggles that he succeeded . Wriggles always hated to be left behind if we were going anywhere . If Jule picked up the car keys , Wriggles rushed out and was sitting hopefully in the front seat of the station wagon when we arrived . Every day Wriggles would come prancing out when we mounted the horses , always sure that we would not desert her . At last , Jule broke down . " This time I 'm taking Wriggles too , " she said decidedly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eagle . " As we were n't catching anything anyhow , I consented . Wriggles triumphantly rode on tile pommel of Jule 's saddle while I carried Aguila . Both Jule and I were a little worried over the puppy . The eagle had nearly killed her once , apparently thinking Wriggles was a rabbit . But since then the two animals had grown used to each other and I was sure Aguila guila no longer regarded Wriggles as something eatable . We turned Wriggles loose on a grassy slope , and while she was investigating some brand-new smells , we trotted off , lizard hunting . We located one almost at once , and Jule took the eagle while I dismounted . We had adopted a new style of hunting . Jule held Aguila while I crawled around behind the iguana and tried to make him run toward the eagle to escape me . In spite of my nervous protestations , Jule had taken to riding toward the lizard at full gallop and throwing off Aguila at the last moment . This was so dangerous on the narrow mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing on end . But by this time the horse and eagle had grown so used to each other that Jule often did not even bother to rein Te-resa in when Aquila was flying back to her . If we were in a hurry to get to a ridge where an iguana had just been Bighted , Jule would call to the eagle , and the bird would fly to her fist while the horse swung along the trail at a canter . In fact , sometimes the eagle would comewithout being called , and if Jute was not ready for him , he would light on Teresa . He did this once while the girl and horse were picking their way along the edge of a cliff , and for a moment I thought the startled mare would carry all three of them over the brink . In this case I had to climb down a long slope in order to get below the lizard . It was not dangerous , but in slippery riding boots it took a long time . Meanwhile Wriggles came panting back to Jule , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slope . The iguana saw her , but the dog was actually smaller than the reptile , and the big lizard simply half rose and hissed at her . Wriggles was charmed . She approached closer to sniff . The iguana snapped and swung around , keeping his open jaws facing the dog . At this moment , Jule had a stroke of genius and threw off the eagle . Everything was in Aguila 's favor . He came whizzing down the long slope , and almost before the lizard knew what was happening , the great bird had him . Although we wanted the iguanas alive , I allowed Aguila to kill and eat this first one to encourage him in future hunts . For a while we optimistically thought our troubles were over . But a week later we had a sharp reverse . Aguila , being an American eagle , had an unfortunate habit of using his beak , instead of his claws , to kill . Only the American eagle , among all birds of prey , does this , and it is a most annoying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely tame , he would sometimes strike at my face when he was excited . I honestly believe there was no malice intended , but after he once laid my left cheek open I became seriously annoyed . It was a nuisance to wear goggles , and yet I did not want to lose an eye . It is impossible to punish an eagle , as he is stronger than you , and also would probably never return again , once he was injured . So there is nothing to do except appeal to the eagle 's better nature , which takes some time . Novel Air Battle One day Aguila flew down to an iguana that Wriggles had turned at bay and , instead of grabbing it , simply lit beside it . I suspect he was growing annoyed because we took the lizards he caught away from him and gave him dead ones in their place as reward . This worked the first few times , but of late Aguila had been catching on and was becoming soured . At all events , instead of coming down with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tried to pick it up in his beak . , But Aguila was to find , to his cost , that iguanas are not called dragons for nothing . The huge lizard twisted like a whiplash and his sharp-toothed jaws clamped on the bird 's lower mandible . Aguila leaped ten feet in the air , and there followed a battle that looked like the struggle between Pegasus and the Chimera . Aguila literally turned somersaults in the air , but the lizard hung on , his long black body whipping back and forth , his sharp claws clutching for a hold . Aguila turned and glided across the valley , frantic with pain and terror , the black monster swinging beneath his neck like a gigantic leech . The mountainside dropped away sharply there , and in a few seconds the eagle was far out over the valley , floating over forests half a mile below . The lizard still hung on . Aguila turned another desperate somersault , and this time managed to seize the hanging iguana with one foot . The reptile never loosened its hold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tearing away a mass of his own feathers and part of the yellow skin that edged his beak as he did so . The iguana plunged down through the thin air , turning slowly over and over , dwindling rapidly from sight until he was only a black dot . I saw him plunge into the forest far below . And I 'll bet the minute he hit the ground he started to run . Not unnaturally , it was some time before Aguila could be persuaded to fly another iguana . I was almost equally determined he should not be caught in such a way again , so I set about training him to catch his quarry only with his feet . For this , I had to manufacture a lure . Then I spent long hours calling Aguila down to the leather bag and snatching it away from him if he tried to grab it with his beak . At the end of a week , the eagle had learned to snatch any moving object with his talons , not with his beak . During this period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was calling Aguila to me while hanging on with one hand to the side of a cliff . The eagle started flying toward me unexpectedly and I could not get the glove on my hand in time to receive him . Naturally , it would have been death and destruction to try to take him on my bare fist , but I needed one hand to hold on to the rocks , and it is hard to pull on a glove with only one nd . A I struggled desperately while Aguila came rushing toward me , his innermost wing almost touching the face of the cliff . But when the eagle saw there was no place to land , he began to scream in indignation . I shouted to him , and for a second we screamed at each other . Then Aguila suddenly realized he was headed right into the cliff face and was going so fast that , unless he lit on my hand , he would dash himself on the rocks . Then he really did yell , while I , knowing he was planning to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loudly . At the last second I thrust my hand into the gauntlet of the glove and held it up . Aguila made a shaky landing and we stared at each other indignantly , while my unfeeling wife howled with laughter on the cliff above . Pour little Chon was nearly caught in the same position . Aguila soared off one day and for a time was lost to sight . Chon and I bunted desperately for an hour , and then I saw the eagle come flying back across a great valley . I sat down to watch him , always thrilled by the sight of the wonderful bird in flight . Then , just before he reached the cliff , I saw Chon standing innocently on a great boulder , cheerfully holding out a tiny bit of meat . The eagle had seen him nearly a mile away and was coming in , but if he had ever lit on the boy 's bare hand Chon would have been seriously injured . Fortunately for our little guide , Jule saw his danger and flung out the lure . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag instead , and poor Chon got the scolding of his young life . The One That Got Away We got our greatest thrill of the summer during the last week of our hunting . There was a giant lizard that lived in the mouth of an old silver mine , deserted since the late-lamented Cortes had solved the Mexican labor-union situation . The natives called this old monster The Saw because his back was corrugated like a saw blade . We had often seen him , but he never strayed far from the cave 's entrance . Then one morning we found him crawling over a green slope covered with little orange field flowers , Instantly I threw Aguila off . , The old warrior heard the whistling of the air through the eagle 's wings . Instantly he turned at bay . Wriggles was not along , which was lucky for Wriggles , and Aguila twice tried to close with the lizard , and each time the snapping jaws kept him away . But Aguila was hungry and determined . He charged in a series of leaping bounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never managing to find a hold . Once the iguana rolled over on his back trying to follow the eagle 's motions , - but he was on his feet again before Aguila could rush in . For several desperate minutes the battle raged down the side of the elope . Then Aguila sprang in once more . " He 's got him ! " I yelled . " No , the iguana has got Aguila ! " screamed Jule . She was right . The lizard had Aquila by the leg . The bird shot across a little depression in the hillside and Old Saw , wiser than the other iguana , dropped off at once . He rushed past Chon , who politely and swiftly stepped to one side , and the lizard vanished under some rocks . We never saw him again . We returned to Philadelphia soon afterward , and presented the Philadelphia Zoological Gardens with our collection of iguanas . None of our captivee was nearly so big as Old Saw . He was the historic one that got away . For a long time Jule and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , enabling us to boast we had caught the largest iguana on record . But now I am really glad that Old Saw is still living happily in those glorious mountains . I think he earned his freedom , and I am sure Aguila would agree with me.
