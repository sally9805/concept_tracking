FIVE years ago when the Farmers ' Hol- iday and penny-auction foreclosures were fresh in American farmers ' minds , and a million farmers were on relief , the Federal government decided to see if these farmers on relief could not be made self-sustaining again through intelligent loans . The word for it was rehabilitation , and the agency was Tug-well 's Resettlement Administration , now the Farm Security Administration . The idea went remarkably well , but when loan failures were analyzed two years later , it was found that about half were caused by bad health . This problem was put up to local doctors and farmers , and in the autumn of 1936 there emerged a plan for medical care . Under this FSA plan a local group of doctors , of their own accord , and a local group of citizens , of their own accord , work together ; one to supply medical care when it is needed , the other to prepay within their ability a uniform sum of money each month whether or not medical care is required . This combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-sustaining farmers . Perhaps the most striking characteristic is the wide geographic dispersion of the co-operative groups . Although each unit usually operates with complete independence on a county-wide basis , if all such counties are blacked in on a map of the United States , the effect is remarkable . As may be seen from the map on page 73 , Republican Vermont is completely black ; so , except for a few counties , are Democratic Georgia and Arkansas . Great areas of Alabama , Kansas , North Carolina and New Mexico are included . Few farm regions remain untouched . And as the program has evolved , the FSA has taken care that the experience gained in one area is not lost to another . Group medical care has been damned and bitterly fought , sometimes through ignorance and misunderstanding , sometimes because of a short-sighted view of self-interest on the part of the medical profession . The FSA plan has been attacked as bitterly as any . Yet many people do not know that group health plans of one sort or another have been in operation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18821 All of these plans have elements in common . The services may include home and office care , hospitalization , surgery , and dental treatment , alone or in combination . Anyone may be eligible to join the organizations , or there may be restrictions such as that only employees of a company may join . Generally the members prepay their way on an average monthly basis , but sometimes a company may contribute the entire cost . The doctors may he free to join the panel serving the group and be paid on a fee basis , or they may be paid a salary . The organization may be a co-operative group of doctors and patients , or of either alone ; or it may be a league of hospitals , or be sponsored by a union or a company . Among existing group health plans ? which supply basic medical and hospital care ? the Northern Pacific Railroad Beneficial Association , founded in 1882 , is probably the oldest . It is owned and run by 20,000 employees , who retain several hundred doctors and operate four hospitals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed in 1937 as a co-operative organization of patients . The first somehow has escaped the antagonism of " organized medicine " but the latter has had to go into the courts to defend its right to exist . Another variation of the group health idea is the Ross-Loos Medical Group , a partnership of Los Angeles doctors formed in 1929 . The earliest rural plan is the Farmers Union Cooperative Hospital Association , founded in 1929 , with a present membership of 1,800 farmers living round Elk City , in western Oklahoma . Many readers will recall the medical service of their college days , which was included in the tuition . This variety ofbeneficence goes back at least as far as 1913 , when it was started at Ann Arbor . The hospitals have been on the whole far more resourceful and successful than the doctors in solving the problems of depression economics . The group hospitalization plan , started as an experiment by Baylor University in 1929 , provides hospitalization only . Group Health provides medical care in the home and in the doctor 's office as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient may go to his doctor at any time , thus minimizing sickness , while the other provides only hospitalization , and provides this only after one is seriously ill ( or is about to have a baby ) . The one tries to lock the stable before the horse escapes , and the other only locks it afterward . This is an essential distinction to remember . All of these plans of general application have been purely private enterprises . The most important exception of course is the medical program organized by the FSA and the participating doctors and patients 80,000 families are now taking part in this program . The group health program of the Farm Security Administration is obviously one flank of a comprehensive attack on farm relief . In 1935 , as already stated , a million farmers were on relief . FSA 's main business is to put such persons back on a self-supporting basis . To be eligible for an FSA loan , a man must be a bona fide farmer , unable to get the necessary money from private lenders . After his character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his neighbors the family gets together with the FSA farm and home management supervisors to work out a plan of living that is likely to succeed . If this can be done enough money is lent to swing the plan . The loans , which average about three hundred dollars , are used to buy a plow , a mule , a cow , fertilizer , and seed . When such equipment as a tractor is uneconomical for one farm alone , money may be lent to a group of farmers to buy it for co-operative use . In the beginning there was no provision for maintaining the family 's health . Mules were better off than men . For instance , after one FSA farmer had used up his loan in part to buy a fine team of mules , one of the animals fell sick . If the mule died a good part of the loan security died with it . The man went down to the FSA supervisor in his county and wanted to know if there was not some way to get a veterinarian . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the mule recovered . But when the man who was making a go of his farm near Pine Bluff suddenly became ill , he had already spent his loan and did n't have the money for medical care for himself . On the second day of his illness he asked the supervisor to get the help of a doctor . Some physicians were out of reach ; others refused to come after learning that there was no money for a fee . Finally an oldtimcr came out to prescribe . The man 's fate is immaterial to the discussion ? the point is that there was no regular provision for maintaining health , and with health gone the loan was gone too . The farm and home supervisors , working day in and day out with these families , soon caught wind of this situation and began to send a steady stream of comment into the administrative offices of the FSA on the need of some scheme of medical care for FSA borrowers . In practice , the ideas and procedures of the FSA medical plans are embodied in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the FSA , and between the FSA and the farmers . These remarkable non-teehnical documents belong in medical history . Never before have there been such forthright formulations of medical relationships among doctor , patient , and an intermediary government . Before any medical care plan is set up in a State the general provisions are carefully outlined to the State Medical Society . If a memorandum is worked out and approved , the latter then gives the FSA permission to solicit the co-operation of the county medical societies . The real work of cooperation is done by the county doctors , and it is not unlikely that the drive for approval of the FSA program by the State Society comes up from the grass roots . The mechanics are simple . The farmers agree to pay a fixed annual amount into a pooled trust fund , according to their ability to pay . Since their cash income for an entire year runs from about $50 to $300 , their payments will vary from $15 to $30 a year . On their side , the physicians who volunteer to join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The pooled fund is divided into 12 monthly portions . At the end of each month the doctors submit their bills to the trustee in charge of this pooled fund . The bills are then reviewed by a committee from the county medical society . If the total of bills approved for payment is less than the sum set aside , bills are paid in full ; if more , the fund is prorated . Any monthly surpluses are applied to deficit months . From 15 to 20 per cent of the paid-in funds are set aside for hospitalization . The participating hospitals arc paid on the same basis as the doctors , with proration in case the funds do not cover the full amount of services rendered . Members of these medical care groups have " free " choice of a physician ; that is , physicians are free to join the co-operative plan , and patients are free to call upon any co-operating physician . The schedule of fees to be used by doctors in billing the fund has been scrupulously left by the FSA in the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no surer way to lose the co-operation of the physicians and incur their hostility , " the Chief Medical Officer of the FSA has said , " than to attempt to say that we think certain charges for medical services are too high or excessive . " Any question relating to a doctor 's services or fees is referred to a committee of physicians , whose decision is final . Similarly , if a family abuses its privilege by making demands upon the doctors for unnecessary services it is reported to the county supervisor , whose business it is to straighten the matter out . Finally there is the agreement with the FSA borrower . In this the farm family is brought into intimate contact with doctors as a group and goes far beyond the usual dictates in a health program ? for now the emphasis is on preventive medicine . I agree to participate . . . in accordance with the memorandum of understanding between the County Medical Society and the FSA . . . . As a further part of this agreement and in furtherance of the health program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my ability to perform and fill the canning budget for fruits and vegetables as set forth in my farm and home plan , observe proper sanitary practices in and around my home , screen doors and windows , keep the well or other sources of drinking water free from contamination , provide sanitary toilet , and co-operate with our family physician on following his suggestions with respect to diet and other health practices . Until recently dentistry was not included in these medical plans . For the run of people , however , dental care ismore of a day-in-and-day-out problern than medical care , and except when there are extremely serious illnesses most middle-class families will find that their dentist gets more of the family income than the doctor . As for the FSA loan program , an abscessed tooth with a prolonged existence has been known to make a good farmer a bad one and its removal to restore his efficiency at once . But a toothachcis not as dramatic as an appendectomy . Hence while hospitals and doctors have been working out plans for equalizing and regularizing the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dental economics has been almost wholly untouched . About a year ago the first FSA dental plan was introduced in Arkansas , and other States have been added with increasing momentum . Group dental care is now widespread in Kansas , Nebraska , and Arkansas , where it covers 105 counties and includes 11,000 families ; and initial units are operating in 12 other States . The set-up parallels the medical counterpart . In Arkansas the dental plan is independent of the medical program , families paying $4 a year for husband and wife and an additional 50 cents for each child : this covers emergency dental care , amalgam fillings , extractions , and cleaning . But in most of the other counties medical and dental care are co-ordinated in a single plan . III To date , the FSA scheme has been tried out over many widely scattered sections of the country . Currently it is at work in 634 counties , embracing 80,000 families and a total of 400,000 persons . While the body of experience accumulated in the course of three or four years is necessarily inconclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been renewed annually by both doctors and farmers favors a strong presumption that the plan works . The results go far toward answering questions on the effectiveness of the programs in reducing and preventing illness , the abuse of privileges , the posiLion of the doctors , and the importance of personal relationships . Scanning the reports from county supervisors on the results of the program , the reader is struck with the strong interdependence of health and economic rehabilitation . As one put it , " Formerly when someone in the family took sick , the chickens , hogs , and calves would have to be sold to raise the necessary funds . " The reports are studded with instances of farmers restored to health and the ability to work by the medical care that otherwise would not have been available . Urban dwellers may find it hard to understand how a family could lack urgent medical care until the coming of some group health organization ? in the city there is usually a free hospital . But few rural areas , especially in the South , enjoy free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family doctor already , and under the circumstances are strongly inclined to put off calling him , often until too late . " Onc of the greatest benefits of the association , " the FSA man from Stone County , Arkansas , said , " is that the doctors go when the client calls and the clients have that secure feeling of being able to get a doctor when they need one . " This freedom to call or visit the doctor raises the question how far the privilege is abused . Some abuse is inevitable , and there have been two or three isolated cases in which a plan had to wind up and start all over again . For the most part , however , the amount of real abuse has been small . Often it happens that families will call on the doctor during the first week more or less for the novelty , to see if the plan really works . When they find that it does , the orientation phase is over . Sometimes the opposite is true ; and families that have become used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medication ) will neglect to see him when they should . A count of the visits made during the first seven months of a recently organized group showed that 57 per cent used it two or fewer times . The most effective preventive of abuse , the FSA experience has shown , is an understanding of the insurance principle of group health schemes ? the momentary peaks of full use by some members offsetting the valleys of non-use by others . Since in practice the doctors as a group get paid the same total amount of money no matter how little or how much work there is to be done , obviously it is advantageous all round for sickness to be minimized . This puts an amiable emphasis on preventive medicine . With the current advance in diagnostic and dietetic science , the profession is just getting to the point where preventive medicine is becoming a big thing . Naturally doctors approach the problem with varying degrees of intensity . In Arkansas , particularly , the doctors were aware of the heavy backlog of work to be done on their FSA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and caught on to the possibilities of preventive medicine right off . In one group of contiguous counties in which the doctors were well acquainted with one another and worked together intelligently they asked the FSA families to be home on a certain Saturday and then made the rounds to take a health inventory . They got a good idea of the work ahead and left " powders " where they would do good . By this sort of intelligent efficiency substantial cuts were made in the sickness and death rates . The clearest demonstration of the possibilities in preventive medicine came through the emphasis which the FSA plans have put on diet . The result was all the more dramatic because the farmers had been eating so badly . In their contract of understanding with the doctors and the FSA the farmers undertook to grow and preserve a certain amount of fruits and vegetables . By 1938 their production of food for home consumption had tripled . Previously most of them had not kept gardens , had put away only a meager stock of canned foods , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , molasses , and coffee were the stand-bys , with oceasional additions of dried beans , sweet potatoes , collards , cabbage , and turnip greens . During nine months of the year fresh or canned vegetables , milk or eggs were scarce or entirely wanting . In contrast , all FSA families now grow tomatoes , lettuce , squash , carrots , spinach , beets , potatoes , rhubarb , corn , and fruits for their own use . And so the time came when the pretty little nurse from Gee 's Bend could say to Doctor R. C. Williams , Chief Medical Officer of the FSA in Washington : " All the pellagra cases seem to be doing fine . We have got some very good gardens this year and I hope we shall be able to control this disease . " The circular relationship between good health and good canning volume showed up in an unsuspected but common spot where the nation 's margin of births over deaths is being produced . The home supervisors have been discouraged in the past because of a large number of women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during pregnancy . The ill health . . ? resulting has made it impossible for them to be good housekeepers or to carry on food preservation programs adequate to meet the needs of their families . But when the canned goods were forthcoming in sufficient doses both mothers and children thrived . " Examination of the school children by the County Health Department , " one supervisor observed , " shows that our children are the best nourished of any rural children examined in two counties ! " After three years of this kind of energetic health-giving in a county with one of the State 's top death rates , a physician facetiously remarked that " a doctor finds it difficult to make a living . " The receptivity of doctors to the idea of an FSA medical program for their own county has usually depended on their familiarity with the specific nature of the proposition , but in ninety-five per cent of the cases their decision after a period of actual experience has been to continue . In a number of instances all the doctors of a county ? often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another well ? had already discussed the idea among themselves and were eager to give it a try . In others a highly generalized fear of " socialized medicine , " instilled by years of bombardment through the journal of the American Medical Association , had to be overcome by careful explanation of the character of the program . The situation has been summed up with some thunder but with a good deal of sense by the chairman of the economics committee of a Midwestern State medical society . " Where the program is in operation , " he exclaimed , " they like it and where they know nothing about it , they are raising hell ! " In line with this observation is the urban-rural division of sympathies ; for it is found that the physician , especially the specialist with a large city practice , is often strongly opposed , but the country practitioner who has been intimately in touch with the medical needs of these farm people for years , largely without payment , has the more liberal attitude . As a general observation , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors to these group health plans has corresponded pretty closely to the degree of unfamiliarity with their workings . When early in 1937 the State medical societies of certain Midwestern areas were approached , " it was found in all cases that the physicians with whom we had contact had no familiarity with the work of the Resettlement Administration or the problems that confronted us . " A particularly good specimen is found in the annals of one rather poor agricultural State . With a view to obtaining the profession 's co-operation , a representative called upon the chairman of the executive committee of the State medical society to explain the FSA plan : It is common knowledge in the State that he rules the State Medical Society with an iron hand . . Now in his seventies , he is quite outspoken in his views and does not mince words in discussing any subject . With these facts before me , I was prepared for a stormy visit with him . Our interview lasted for two hours . My general attitude was to meet whatever attitude he tnnk with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used profanity . If he told jokes , I told jokes , but / always brought him back to the problem of families that need medical care . In general , I took a half-serious , half-humorous attitude , pointing out to him that he had been " on relief ( that is , on the public payroll as a health officer ) longer than I. One of the first statements he made was that the program was in conflict with medical ethics . A definite effort was made to pin him down to just what medical ethics were being violated . The interview was quite heated at times . Fortunately , however , neither of us lost our temper . The conference covered every conceivable subject from genealogy to New Deal economics . The final result of the conference was that the Doctor invited me to present a summary of the proposed program for his consideration . It is felt that definite progress has been made in explaining the program to him . The principal difficulty heretofore appears to have been that no one could get him to listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once the approval of the State medical society was gained ? which often turned on winning over a single dominating personality in the organization ? it was easier to deal with the county societies , although here too the information process had to be repeated . The main strength of the FSA programs naturally has come from among the doctors at the grass roots , and its strength has grown with experience . The evolution of attitude can be seen from a typical resolution in which a county medical society announces its intention to keep on with the FSA plan for another year . . In the beginning we were not altogether in favor of same as we were in doubt as to the good that could be realized from our co-operation . Since we have worked with the FSA during the past year , we wish to say that same has been a wonderful aid to the low-income farmers . We feel that we have been well paid for our services , not altogether in dollars and cents , but in the work that we are able to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We wish to state that . . . we will continue our services with same during the coming year . The general reaction of co-operating doctors has been favorable ; but there have been a few serious sources of dissatisfaction , all of which turn on the necessarily low fees paid into the pooled funds by the farmers . The complaint has been , not that the doctors get less than before , but that they are not receiving as much as they should . Undoubtedly more service is being given than previously and this has increased the load on doctors . They are now receiving more money , however , than before . The incomes of many had fallen so low that they were not far from relief themselves , and the introduction of the Farm Security Administration 's medical program helped them to retain an independent financial status . Before its establishment the average rural doctor in FSA territory might have collected 50 per cent of the total amount of his bills , although this is a high figure and more usually the percentage ran to 40 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average of payments by the most prosperous as well as the poorest families . Some paid more , some paid all ; many paid less , some paid nothing . FSA households are of the latter group . Their doctors today are getting about 65 per cent on their bills from these families who previously were able to pay less than half of that or nothing ; or who simply did n't get needed medical care and therefore did not run tip bills . A doctor out in Kansas with a bent for keeping accounts found that for three years from January , 1936 , to January , 1939 , he had collected from 42 families an average of 11 per cent of the amount of bills submitted . By individual households payment varied from zero to a high of 56 per cent . The same 42 families later joined up with an FSA medical plan , and the doctor 's books show that during the first six months , between May and December , 1939 , he had collected 61 per cent . Some of the doctors , who must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor territories , worked out ingenious methods to increase their income above the limits of the FSA plan . The most popular seemed to be the extraction of a promise from families to pay the difference between the original bill and the reduced amount received from the group plan . This was not general among the doctors , and the medical society in many cases managed to correct it . One county supervisor reported that the physicians were willing to co-operate for another year , " and if we can get them to agree that no fee is charged the client outside the regular fee paid in to the medical service , the program will continue . " A few county enterprises met their Waterloo on the remuneration problem , but 95 per cent went on to another year . The ordinary middle-class school teacher , office manager , or real-estate agent would never suspect that a substantial source of difficulty has been the furnishing of drugs . In most of the FSA plans as originally designed drugs for sick patients were supplied by the doctor out of his fees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his net compensation from FSA families , and in one South Carolina county drug trouble wrote finis to the plan . Usually though the problem has been ironed out in one way or another . In Logan County , Arkansas , the druggists were asked and agreed to take a 20 per cent discount on drug bills . " This helped some . " In another county people thought that a small amount ought to be set aside in addition to the regular medical funds . The supervisors of Monroe County , " after careful consideration of the matter with the doctors of the county medical association , decided to cut off the medicine . " The trouble with this as discovered in another county was that the low-income families might put off getting the drugs and in that way to a large extent defeat the physician 's care . Perhaps this is as good a place as any to insert the inevitable paragraphs of statistics , using Georgia for the purpose . There are 26,000 families on the FSA rolls in the State , with about 14,000 participating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little over $15 a year , the aggregate coming to about $210,000 . Approximately 85 per cent of this is put aside for doctors and hospitals . Both get about two-thirds of their reviewed bills , although in other States the hospitals do better , getting an average of 85 per cent . On the average , a family visited the doctor at his office four times a year and was visited at home about twice . Hospital cases average fourteen a year per hundred families , lasting about 7 days apiece . Pregnancies ran about 9 per 100 families , almost all of them home deliveries . Most of the time and effort has gone to develop group medical plans of this sort . But there have been three important variations , each dictated by peculiar conditions : one for FSA homesteads , another for agricultural migrants , and a third for the drought-bitten Dakotas . The Dakota plan was set up on a State instead of a county basis and did not survive . Money was short and local doctors were too far away from the central State office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plan arc working . The 161 homesteads are sparsely settled clusters of 100 to 200 adjoining farms . Usually isolated at some distance from city and doctor , they offer a particularly difficult problem . At Es-cambia Farms , Florida , before the FSA , the county doctor had to drive 18 to 25 miles one way and charged $15 a visit , thank you but do n't call again . The answer is group prepayment of uniform fees , but for the services of a single part-time doctor who may hold clinic at the homestead twice a week and make home visits on need . The fees are somewhat higher than in the regular FSA plan , but will vary with services included and special circumstances . The influx of poor farm migrants to California and Arizona since 1935 has created a troublesome public-health situation . These families live in roadside jungles , patched-up tents , or hastily improvised shelters without any sanitary facilities . Their continual movement from one area to another at times over three hundred miles away has contributed to the spread of communicable diseases . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , outbreaks of smallpox or typhoid in widely separated counties have occurred . It has been too much for the State alone to handle . So in February , 1938 , the FSA , together with the California Medical Association , the State Department of Health , and the State Relief Administration , formed a non-profit organization to supply medical care to the migrants on a " pay when you can " basis . To-day in 634 counties in 32 different States group health plans organized by the FSA are in operation . The experiencc brings a clearer understanding of what can be done for public health when people know what they are about . To-day , with the question of national defense absorbing us all , the health of our people is more vital than ever . In 1938 114,000 men tried to join the Navy and Marine Corps ; 82,000 of them-72 per cent ? were rejected , most of them because of bad teeth , poor eyes , or defective physical development . Under the circumstances , it is not surprising that even the Army is said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
