Cleveland 's Lincoln Electric Co. got an order for arc-welding electrodes , weighing 700 Ib . The order itself took a single sheet of paper . But with it came si Ib. of priority extensions , taking 597 sheets of paper ( see cut ) . Each priority ( 199 in all ) required typed fill-ins , two signatures ( one notarized with seal ) . President James Finney Lincoln last week calculated that it cost him much less in money and man-hours to make the electrodes ( which sold for $40.90 ) than to fill out the forms . When he thought of the man-hours spent by his customer in getting the priorities , he stopped trying to calculate , let out a cry against red tape .
