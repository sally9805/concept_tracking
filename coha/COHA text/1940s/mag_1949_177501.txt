The bull session in the Tri-Kap house at Dartmouth College on that March night was fueled with just enough liquor to keep the conversation lively . But after a while the desultory talk started to get a little ugly : the subject of Ray Cirrotta cropped up among the eight undergraduates , among whom were the varsity football center and a second-string lineman . <P> Ray Cirrotta , an ex-G.I. , was a bright boy , and he sometimes let people know it . A couple of the fellows who took Comparative Lit. 24 and Ed. 4 with him would testify to that . He always had an answer before the rest of them . He was quick , articulate and by the standards of the football players and their friends , much too opinionated . Maybe it would n't be a bad idea to take him down a bit . <P> A Visit to Ray . As the story was pieced together later , this is what happened : the eight shambled over to Massachusetts Hall where Ray roomed , and walked in without bothering to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a white " D " knitted into it . That also got their goat : Cirrotta had played freshman football and was entitled only to class numerals . One of them sneered : " You even sleep in it . " " No , " said Ray , " I was cold . " <P> Then Tom Doxsee , a good-looking , bull-necked junior , punched him in the belly . Ray doubled up on a daybed and Doxsee hit him again when he sat up . He hauled Cirrotta up by the sweater and gave it to him for the third time . Somewhere along the line , another of the eight whacked Ray . The boys also wrecked the room . The student who lived across the hall found Ray in the bathroom wiping the blood off a cut lip , and put him to bed . Later he had to be taken to the hospital . There , after five hours , Ray Cirrotta died on the operating table of a cerebral hemorrhage . Dartmouth suspended the eight students . <P> A Trip to Court . Last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial at Plymouth , 48 miles from Dartmouth . The prosecutor , Grafton County Solicitor Robert Jones , was a Dartmouth graduate . So was one of Doxsee 's lawyers , Charles Tesreau , son of the late Jeff Tesreau , onetime Dartmouth baseball coach and pitcher for the New York Giants . <P> The first day all the principals went to the campus to look over Cirrotta 's quarters . The next morning they huddled for several hours . In the afternoon an announcement was made in court : the state would permit Tom Doxsee to change his plea from not guilty to no contest . The judge gave him a sentence of one to two years in prison , which was suspended , and a $500 fine . Ray Cirrotta 's father , in court for the hearing , collapsed when he heard the sentence . Young Tom Doxsee , as his lawyer paid the $500 , said he was " disappointed " with the verdict , too . He seemed to think it was too severe .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
