The first D-day newsreels reached U.S. theaters on D-day plus nine . They are the collective effort of U.S. , British and Canadian Army , Navy , Air Force and newsreel cameramen . They have caught some of the finest , most moving , most revealing shots ever made of war : <P> Swift , terrific plane shots of the thousand wakes of the invasion fleet , so deep below that they resemble the tremulous urgency of amoebae on a microscope slide . <P> An enemy fighter plane exploding like a toy . <P> The faces of Generals Eisenhower and Montgomery-faces heavy with power , craft , superhuman responsibility , humanly transfigured by the exhilaration of a great and successful change of rhythm in history . <P> The faces of enemy prisoners-despairing , angry , sullen or incredulous , betraying more clearly than in any previous film the certainty that from that day on , the struggle was hopeless . <P> The finest shot of all was made by U.S. Signal Corps Sergeant Dick Taylor ( who , though wounded later , kept at his job ) from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bow . The barge is under fire . The men in it , crouched low , show a physical , animal restlessness more revealing-and far more complex-than any manifestation of pure fear . Beyond the bow of the barge , wavering with the motion of the water , and terrifyingly close , loom the upper floors of bleak Norman seaside houses . The barge opens its mouth . Not in a neat , eager , clattering rush as people have sometimes imagined , but wretchedly , one by one , crabwise the crouching men disembark , hip-deep , and begin to wade ashore . Their officer , at the blunt bow , stands erect and unprotected . As , one by one , he gestures his men forward , he is almost smiling .
