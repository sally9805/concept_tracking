Today Christianity is implicated in history just as much as Israel was in the age of the prophets . . . . In the old days war could be regarded as Caesar 's proper business , but today it is everybody 's business and it touches the things of God as well as those of men . . . . Modern war is a . . . test of moral strength for the whole population : and hence in the last resort it is a conflict which calls for the intervention of spiritual powers and demands a spiritual decision . <P> For the first time since the Reformation , Britain 's Catholics , Anglicans and dissenters got together in London last week for two church-sponsored , jampacked , inter-faith mass meetings . The Catholic Primate of England presided at the first session , the Anglican Primate of all England at the second . The purpose was to dramatize the Church 's determination to play a leading part in the post-war settle ment . The justification is quoted in italics above . <P> Prime mover for this gesture was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this has been an entirely Catholic movement , but a significant development at the rallies was the suggestion that Sword of the Spirit groups be formed in Protestant parishes as well . S.O.S. is a loose-knit series of groups for waging anti-Nazi spiritual war , draws its name from Ephesians 6:17 : " And take unto you the helmet of salvation , and the sword of the Spirit ( which is the word of God ) . " <P> Lean , square-chinned , purblind Arthur Cardinal Kinsley , Archbishop of Westminster , and shrewd , courtly Cosmo Gordon Lang , Archbishop of Canterbury , each spoke briefly at the meetings over which they presided-in the Stoll Theater , garish London movie house , before and after a night of Blitz . But the principal fireworks were supplied by the Bishop of Chichester in a strong attack on the British Government for not giving the anti-Nazi world a post-war program to fight for . <P> " The Nazis have a weapon which they wield with tremendous effect , " said the Bishop . " It is the weapon of the idea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proclaim no order at all . . . . Our official spokesmen have never yet uttered any statement of British aims which envisages a situation after victory . . . . We stand for a Christian order-a better order than any of us have yet known . It is not the order which existed when the war began or ... the order which was imposed when the World War ended . . . . But the winning of that order is the only thing which offers any hope or comfort or inspiration to the common man . " <P> The churchmen approved a ten-point peace program based on the proposals of Pope Pius XII and the unprecedented joint letter which the Archbishops of Westminster , Canterbury and York , and Dr. Walter H. Armstrong , moderator of Britain 's Free Church Federal Council sent last December ( TIME . Dec. 30 ) to the London Times . This program quite clearly presupposes a new society . But Britain 's Christians now realize what they did not at the start of World War II : that Hitler is fighting the war with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better idea it is done for . Britain 's churches are also saying clearly that , necessary as it is to win the war . it is still more important to win the peace .
