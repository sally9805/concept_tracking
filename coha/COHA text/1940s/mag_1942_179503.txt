Mrs. Frank G. Logan got so hopping mad when the Chicago Art Institute gave the Logan prize to Doris Lee 's painting Thanksgiving that she founded a group called Sanity in Art to fight against " insane " modern art . That was in 1935 . Since then Chicago artists have kept a leery eye on Mrs. Logan , especially on the day when the Logan prize ( $500 ) is awarded . <P> Last week the Logan prize went to a piece of sculpture , Kneeling Women by Abbott Lawrence Pattison , now in the Naval Reserve Midshipmen 's School in Chicago . There was not a peep from Mrs. Logan . Chicago Art Institute Director Daniel Catton Rich , who puts on the yearly show of Chicago 's artists , breathed a sigh of relief . <P> To Director Rich 's show , 174 painters and 26 sculptors of Chicago ( and vicinity ) sent a work apiece . Most famed was Landscapist Aaron Bohrod ( who won the Logan prize in 1937 ) , noted for his glowing watercolors of Chicago back streets . Less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artists is Art Institute Instructor Francis Chapin , who was picked by the Museum of Modern Art for its recent show of little-known U.S. artists ( TIME , Feb. 2 ) . Copeland Burg , who paints between jobs as a crime reporter on the Herald-American , won a prize at the Institute show this year ; so did Felix Ruvolo , with a quizzical portrait , Girl with Dog , and Russian-born Raymond Breinin , who paints imaginary scenes somewhat like of famed Russian Marc Chagall . <P> Chicago 's progressive artists hope the day of Sanity in Art is waning . One sign : they have found a Chicago collector who does n't seem to care whether Chicago art is sane or not : he likes it . Advertising executive Earle Ludgin is mighty proud of his collection of Ivan Le Lorraine Albrights ( TIME , Nov. 24 ) ; he has recently added a batch of Burgs and Bohrods.
