Twelfth Night ( by William Shakespeare ; The Theatre Guild-Gilbert Miller , Producers ) was first produced on Candlemas Day , Feb. 2 , 1602 , in London 's Middle Temple Hall , which a few weeks ago was struck by a Nazi bomb . Neither bombs nor centuries seriously alter Shakespeare 's comedy . It can be richly indecent as in Measure for Measure , swift and slapstick as in The Taming of the Shrew . It can also be very mild , very mannered-as in Twelfth Night . The Guild production of the play is exquisite , but the net effect is that of a high ritual of antique jokes . <P> If the play 's humor is weak , its potential charm is great , and the Guild 's leading players are perfectly at home in the blandishing groove . Helen Hayes makes her Broadway Shakespearean debut ( two years ago she played Portia in Chicago ) in the role of Viola , who , in boy 's clothes , pleads the amorous cause of the Duke of Illyria , Orsino , whom she loves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Hayes 's powers as an upper-case Shakespearean Actress . She scores merely by being Helen Hayes , very feminine despite her striped pantaloons , giving a clear , pliant reading of the part . <P> The leading Shakespearean actor of this time , Maurice Evans , plays the pompous Malvolio with his usual moist , resonant subtlety of speech . He also adopts a Cockney accent that undoubtedly makes the labored humor of the part more amusing than it really is . Into the pronunciation of the single word ' " Run ? " he manages to crowd an enormous amount of haughty comedy . <P> Shakespearean Directrix Margaret Webster who also did Evans 's Richard II , Hamlet and Henry IV , Part I , has done her usual best by the Bard . Stewart Chancy has designed Italianate landscapes that loom softly behind the players . Paul Bowles , among the up- &-coming; young American composers , has written lingering music for Shakespeare 's songs , celebrating love and death with flute , oboe , harp , harpsichord , percussion and muted trumpet . The Bard , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a playwright could wish . The audience 's rewards are less solid .
