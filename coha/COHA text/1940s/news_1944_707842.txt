txt After 20 chaotic days of unrationed sale of most meats the food trade and a meat-hungry public are in fervent agreement with a harried Los Angeles wholesaler who yesterday summed up the situation as : " Just plain . cockeyed . " Without exception , householders in 15 metropolitan areas surveyed by The Wall Street Journal are finding it harder to buy meat now than before ration points were lifted . The quality of what meat is available . many cities report , seems to have declined markedly . A majority of store managers complain that they are getting less of the unrationed meats now than three weeks ago ; the most favorable report received from any chain or individual store was that " supplies are about unchanged . " More typical was a report from one of Chicago 's largest retailers whose meat department revenues have dropped 39% since rationing ended because of increasing shortages . The situation is getting worse , many food stores say . A Cleveland chain , for example , last week had the problem of parceling .3 , A 15 lambs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nation . a Chicago ; dealer reports " no veal for three weeks " and lamb supplies cut " by at least 70% since rationing ended . " What 's the Explanation ? Retailers , packers and Government officials have a multitude of explanations , some in violent conflict , as to what the meat situation is all about . The War Food Administration . Federal agency charged with keeping the food situation in hand , talks of " distribution difficulties " arising when most cuts of meat were put on a buy-all-you-can-get basis . It cites the huge stocks in cold storage , 1.215,501,000 pounds on May 1 compared with 714,612,000 on the same date a year ago . to illustrate that " sta. tistically " there is a lot of meat . However , it concedes that these figures are somewhat misleading as a much higher-than normal pro- portion of stored meats consists of less desirable cuts . The big Chicago packers operating on a national basis emphasize that they are allocating supplies equitably to customers in all sections of the country . However , they cite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are getting a smaller than normal proportion of animals while the Government 's huge purchases are concentrated with such plants . On the other hand , they maintain that smaller , local slaughter houses have been handling more than their usual proportion of meat . Packers also report that the Services and other Government agencies recektly have been placing large orders for choice cuts ; these orders . of course . are filled before civilian customers get anything . One result is an oversupply of less desirable types of meat . For example , there is more pork fat back , pig tails and hog neck than the civilian market can absorb . The Manpower Problem Local packers complain about price ceilings and an acute manpower shortage . One San Francisco firm , calling attention to the fact that the nation 's livestock population is the biggest ever , remarked that " It 's raining soup and we have a spoon . " In the San Francisco area the slaughter houses and packers have instituted a 60-hour week for all workers in a losing attempt to make up for lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release from the Army a minimum of 500 skilled and 1,000 miscellaneous workers Almost without exception , the retail food trade , national chains and corner grocers alike , would be happy indeed to see the Government put most or all meats back under the point system . Telling good customers " no lamb , no veal , no ham today " is a wearing business . The 0 P.A. has received a sizable number of requests from dealers to restore the point system It is understood , also , that most members of the War Food Administration would not oppose a general restoration of meat rationing . Apparently . hbwever. such a policy world run into some conflict with the views of many meat-packing companies and the &merman; Meat Institute The A M.I. takes ** general view that removal of points was a good thing and emphasizes that it takes time to get meat moving into distribution channels to supply unrationed demand .

At the time he took action , Price Administrator Chester Bowles pointed out that he could not " say now when or whether the meats we are making point free will again have to he given print values . " Significantly . he added that " much depends on the feed situation , which , in turn , is dependent in ; large measure on the weather . " Some in the I food trade are now inclined to place even greater emphasis on this portion of the announcement which ? ended rationing of most ' meats . They argue that the acute shortage of feed , rather than any over-supply of meat under rationing , was the major factor involved in the Government 's decision and that the idea was to get animals off the feed lots and farms so there would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities covered by The Wall Street Journal 's meat supply survey follow : New York : Two of the nation 's biggest chains report that by the most strenuous efforts they have been able to secure " about " the same amount of meat as before points were lifted . A somewhat better supply of beef and pork is offset by less lamb and veal . They hope that the lamb supply will improve in coming weeks as the spring crop begins moving to market . Typical independent stores ' checked report a " substantially smaller " supply of meat than before rationing was ended . Philadelphia : Packers say the Government is buying up huge quantities of beef and high-grade pork . Retailers report generally that " all types of meat " are hard to get , with lamb a " rare item : Sales at retail have been restricted by scarcity of meat . Boston : One of the biggest chains has taken to " allocating lamb " to its outlets as it does beef . It blames the lamb shortage in part on price regulations which remove the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than before this meat became point-free . Boston 's biggest wholesaler says the supply of lamb is decreasing and the same is true of some pork cuts - Pittsburgh : Beef , veal , hams and better cuts of pork are growing more and more scarce ; hams have all but disappeared from butcher shops since they became point-free . Better cuts of beef , veal and lamb are hard to ! find . Restaurants are featuring brains , kidneys , pig tails , tongue . Cleveland : Chain stores report shortages of all kinds of meat ? they say the Government Altai week took a huge supply of ham . Local processors report that a recent rise in beef cattle prices has cut slaughtering . The Ohio Provision Co. estimates that it takes a four cents a pound loss for every pound it processes and , as a result , is slaughtering only enough to give customers a little as " a good will gesture .

The manpower situation gets part of the blame One large packer whose normal kill is 12.000 to 14,000 hogs a week is now operating on a 9.000-animal schedule for lack of labor to do more .
