UCH more than the third-term . A. tra-M dition was shattered when President Roosevelt took the oath of office again on Monday . Who elected him ? As in all elections , there were many crosscurrents , but the 1940 answer is simple and inescapable . The little fellow elected him , because there are more of the little fellow and because he believed Mr. Roosevelt to be his friend and protector . Roosevelt won by the vote of Labor , unorganized as well as organized , plus that of the foreign born and their first and second generation descendants . And the Negro . It was a class-conscious vote for the first time in American history , and the implicit , Loris are portentous . The New Deal appears to have accomplished what the Socialists , the I. W. W. and the Communists never could approach . It has drawn a class line across the face of American politics . That line seems to be there to stay . While thousands of wage earners , even voters on relief , voted for Willkie , we are talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first President to owe his election in such great measure to the teeming cities . On the farms and in the towns Mr. Willkie more than held his own . It was in the industrial centers that the Republican hopes were blacked out in factory smoke . The Republican campaign had virtually no effect on this vote , the evidence argues . I doubt that anything Willkie might have done would have affected it . The election was not decided on the issues he debated , but on forces long at work  --  economic status , nationalities , birth rates . The rise of Government as an employer on a scale rivaling the biggest business is a fourth . And the indications are that this vote might have gone to Roosevelt for a fourth or a fifth term as readily as for a third . It is an American habit to forget an election quickly when the votes have been counted . We did so , as usual , and , so , few yet have grasped the fact that this was not just another election . The Republicans do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished from the New Diadem , do not know what they hit . the Republicans with . The New Deal has aimed at a bloodless revolution . In 1940 it went a long way toward accomplishing it . In numbers it was no great victory . Roosevelt won by the smallest plurality and the smallest percentage of the total vote since the neck-andneck election of 1916 . If his strength should diminish between now and 1944 at the same rate it did between 1936 and 1940 , he would be beaten in 1944 . The opposition is taking comfort in these figures , but the 1940 vote upset the fundamentals of our old two-party system , and when the fundamentals are overturned , past-performance figures are worthless . In considerable measure the vote was personal for Mr. Roosevelt . No one may say how far , if he does nut run for a Fourth term , he might he able to deliver this vote in 1944 to an heir . What is clear is that , once Roosevelt is out of the picture , this vote will not slip back automatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fought with new tactics and new weapons to unpredictable results . I say this on the basis of a firsthand study of thirteen of the cities , from Boston to Seattle , which piled up the Roosevelt vote . While the body stillwas warm , the Post sent me to hold a postmortem . My instructions were : " Ignore the Solid South and the machine vote . Stay out of actual slums ; these may be taken for granted . Forget the rights and wrongs of the campaign . Something extraordinary happened on November fifth . Find out where the rest of the New Deal vote came from , and why . Then tell your findings as impartially as if you were reporting a football game . " In thirteen large cities I studied the returns by wards , then by precincts , then by neighborhoods . When I had winnowed out the leas significant . I went on foot into the others , talking to ward lead-ens and precinct captains , to churchmen , union utlicials , businessmen and housewives . In each city I concentrated finally upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole  --  in Boston , an Irish ward ; in Detroit , an automobile workers ' district . BOSTON . In the shadow of the Bunker Hill Monument , in historic Charlestown , Roosevelt rolled up a plurality of nearly four to one . The frame houses built in the days of Edward Everett still stand . Mounting the narrow hillside streets to the monument , they seem heaped one on top of another in factory-district congestion , the back yards barely providing clothesline space . Living in those homestoday are lungmhoremen , Foundry workers , packers , waitresses and minor city employees . About 65 per cent are Irish Catholic . A typical Boston working-clam district , Charlestown is not a slum . Poorer sections of the city went nine to one for Roosevelt . Prevailing in-COMES of Charlestown families range frorn $1200 to $1500 ; about one in five own their honing . Those who du are mighty proud of it . Good-sized metal plates proclaiming the owner 's name are nailed to every door like family shields . William J. Galvin , the thirty-six-year-old councilman and Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote : " Probably no section in the country gained more under the New Deal . " Galvin can check off the gains against the total ward population of 30,000 : Hundreds gut pay raises under the wage-hour law ; more hundreds of seasonal workers are having slack months cushioned by unemployment-insurance benefits . TheNYA is helping from : 100 to 500 youths ; at the worst of the depression thousands held WPA jobs ; of 1500 persons past sixty five in the ward . more than 600 receive old-age assistance ; another 600 cases are on direct relief and get aid for dependent children . Charlestown is a food-stamp area ; the WPA improved its bathing beach ; new low-cost housing project will relieve some of the ward 's congestion . Nearly one half of those of voting age are under forty . The economic memories of many of these voters begin with Hoover . Galvin 's two younger brothers got out of high school during the depression and went into CCC camps . They now are working as electrician 's and pipefitter 's helpers in the near-by Boston Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent months . Galvin has two other brothers , a lawyer and a school custodian ; one or his brothers-in-law works as a planner in the navy yard and the others work as bookbinder , salesman and chauffeur . Of nine Galvin breadwinners , five rely on public employment . To the two younger brothers , the New Deal I Continued on Page 97 ) has meant advancement as real as any they could have got under a private employer . To Charlestown 's Irish , the New Deal has meant an advance along other fronts too . They are the sons and daughters , the grandsons and granddaughters of the immigrants who swarmed into Boston in the last quarter of the nineteenth century . Then the " Yankee vote " ruled Massachusetts . Classified-job advertisements carried notices , " No Irish need apply . " But the immigrant Irish reared larger families than the Yankees . Through sheer numbers , they toppled the harriers in profession after profession . By the 20 's they had acquired local political dominance . Being Democrats under Republican Presidents , though , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Building can not recall a single Irishman on the U. S. district court before 1933 . Roosevelt has made two appointments to that court , the names , Sweeney and Ford . Postmaster Peter Tague , who lives in Charlestown , is Irish , as are the collector of customs , the U. S. marshal , several assistant U.S. attorneys . In Charlestown alone , Galvin estimates , Irishmen have got more than 400 Federal jobs under the New Deal . Not only for the poor but for those better off economically , Roosevelt has become the champion of the Irish climb up the American ladder . BUFFALO . Of all voting groups in the country , none gave Roosevelt greater pluralities than the Polish-Americans . In Cleveland , Detroit , Chicago and Milwaukee they rolled up astonishing majorities . Typical were Buffalo 's Polish wards , which went nine to one , with individual precincts as high as twenty-five to one . Roughly one third of Buffalo 's population is Polish or of Polish descent . Centering around Broadway and Fill-more Avenue , they have a community all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English ; the streets have Polish names ; a Polish-language newspaper , claiming 40,000 circulation , headlines the latest woes from Europe . There is a local Polish insurance company , a typically Old World market . The market , housed in a huge block-long shed and spilling into the open air for another block or two , displays everything imaginable . Stall keepers wear caps or shawls , as in the old country ; at meat counters , shoppers with an ancient skill prod the chickens dangling from the hooks , to see if they are plump . The fat that has dripped off can he spread on bread like butter . There are modern touches like a neon by-line , " Sausages by Szelakowski . " Buffalo 's Poles are solidly Roman Catholic , and wherever one walks the green-roofed twin spires of a Catholic church can be seen towering over the two-story frame dwellings . The priesthood still is one of the major callings young Poles aspire to . Few Poles have acquired a white-collar status . Four out of five girls work in mills and factories ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being unionized rapidly . In one beer tavern some workers were listening to John L. Lewis ' speech . When the CIO leader got through endorsing Wilikie , there was silence , then a worker said , with a curse , " He 's sold us out . " These Poles are thrifty . With prevailing incomes between $1500 and $2000 , they support several neighborhood banks . The homes , worth around $2500 to $3500 , represent largely the savings the elderly Poles have rescued from the depression . Many support themselves by renting out part of the house , perhaps to a married son or daughter . As in Charlestown , the New Deal seems to have effected a wholesale shift in the working population . Older workers who lost their jobs during the depression have not been reabsorbed . What employment is opening up , as in the aircraft plants , is being spread among younger workers . The older , if without homes or savings , are cared for by the community . Relief officials estimate that 65 per cent of the families get some form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of these , about a third are totally dependent . Few houses have garages , but the streets are lined with automobiles . Many of the same houses have outside privies and lack baths . The free municipal bathhouse erected in the neighborhood some forty years ago still tallies from 12,000 to 17,000 visits a month . Mechanical refrigerators and washing machines gleam from store windows ; the washing machines significantly in front . Also electric sewing machines . Many Polish housewives still do their own mending and laundering . Silk stockings in the shops sell for forty-nine and fifty-nine cents a pair ; the glamour of a fur coat can be had for from $24.00 to $69.50 ; one store rents out Tuxedos . It was Saturday night . A young girl was waiting in front of her home , the wispy tips of her blue evening gown showing beneath her cloth coat . Another girl passed by with her mother . All the way down the street this second girl kept turning back , for another hungry glimpse of that bit of evening gown . Health Commissioner Dr. F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth rate ran 40 per cent higher than that of the rest of the city . The children of those children have been coming to voting age in recent years . From Buffalo , the Poles spread into suburbs like Lancaster , Lackawanna , Cheektowaga . One big election surprise was Erie County , normally Republican , going Roosevelt . The Poles in those towns tipped the balance . Within Buffalo , for the first time at this election , the Poles mustered enough votes to elect a judge . In the struggle for social and political recognition , a judgeship seems to be the index of having arrived . It means , first , that the immigrant family has risen high enough economically to send its son through college ; second , that it has gained sufficient political strength to have that son named or elected to the bench . John Kryzinski , a tavern keeper and unofficial ward leader , was foaming over like his beer at the significance of this judgeship . " Out in ritzy Humboldt Park they get two voters to a family , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . I got neighbors who give me eight . We elected a judge this year . The way things are going , in eight years we 'll elect a mayor . " MILWAUKEE . Buffalo 's overwhelming vote for Roosevelt was expected and , by reverse English , Milwaukee , with its huge population of German descent , was figured to give the President only a slight lead . When the returns were in , Roosevelt had the surprising plurality of more than 70,000 . While the Poles , the second largest nationality group in the city , contributed heavily , the decisive factor was the shift of the Socialists , who control half the city council . In the seventh ward , Alderman Alex Rut-ling , Socialist , has been elected and re-elected since 1918 almost invariably by a two-to-one margin . Last November , Roosevelt got 6860 votes in the ward to Willkie 's 3470 . Norman Thomas crumb-picked 504 votes . Normally , Thomas can count on 50,000 votes in all Milwaukee . In 1940 he got 11,000 . Stack that 39,000 difference against the 25.000 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ward 's Socialists are not the radical type . They are about evenly split between native and foreign born , with about 70 per cent of German Protestant extraction . Their Socialism was inherited from their ancestors who fled from Germany in 1848 . Of middle-class means , their rentals average around thirty dollars at month . About 40 per cent own their homes , which range in value from $2000 to $7000 . Mostly the workers are skilled artisans  --  mechanics , bricklayers , carpenters and shoe workers . At the depression 's worst , one half of them were unemployed ; Ruffing would have 150 and more job-seeking callers a day . In recent months the indigent callers have dwindled to three or four a week . The Socialist shift to Roosevelt , Ruffing explains with a little shrug of inevitability : " He enacted all the laws we Socialists had advocated for years . " The very closeness of the vote in Wisconsin seems to have swelled the Roosevelt outpouring . In keeping January 25,1941 with German tradition that a woman 's place is in the kitchen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In November they hung that tradition up with their aprons and swarmed to the polls , lest Roosevelt 's social reforms he lost . DETROIT . Roosevelt 's greatest pluralities in Wayne County were registered in the Polish districts of Hamtramck , where precincts went twenty and thirty to one for him . More typical of the city as a whole , though , are two auto-worker precincts in the twenty-first ward which went for Roosevelt three to one . Economically , these precincts fall into the great average sectors of Detroit . They are a food-stamp area ; incomes run between $1200 and $1400 a year ; neighborhood movies charge twenty cents admission ; the well-kept private homes are worth between $2500 and $5000 . " Sleeping room for rent " signs in many windows mirror the transient , half-boom , half-broke nature of auto-plant employment . Workers in the two precincts are predominantly native white , better than half Protestant . In a random apartment house one finds such names as Baldwin , Walsh , Gibson , Calhoun , Costello , Powers , Snyder , Saltzgiver and Solomon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South during the 20 's . Labor says that these " hillbillies , " as they are known , were brought in because it was felt that they would he less inclined to join unions and would be easier to handle . Today the hillbillies are high in union councils . Chrysler Local Seven , in the fore of the sit-down strike of 1937 , has its headquarters in one precinct . The local has its own three-floor building , which at shift time becomes a buzz of activity . Four girls behind teller windows collect dues  --  the local claims 10,000 members . A stream of visitors pours in and out of the offices of the president and the shop committee . Nearly fifty such United Auto Workers locals are scattered throughout the city . Their listings in the telephone book run to half a column . Only the state , Federal and municipal governments have longer listings . Like Los ANGELES . Even where organized labor still is battling for a foothold , Roosevelt 's appeal to the workingman proved overwhelming . Los Angeles has long been known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city 's fifth district handily ; Roosevelt swept it by three to one in 1940 . The skilled craftsmen in the metal and building trades who live here he-long to the AFL . The great mans of unskilled and semiskilled workers re-main unorganized , although the CIO is winning adherents . Two rubber factories are located near the district ; in one the United Rubber Workers have a contract . A near-by steel mill has signed with the CIO . Save for a few apartment houses the district is composed of small homes , mainly frame bungalows . About 40 per cent are owned by the workers ; rents for the others run from twenty to thirty dollars . Rents are low in Los Angeles , and this area falls in the middle third for the city . About one fourth of the families earn less than $1800 ; the others up to $2500 . MINNEAPOLIS . " Traditionally Republican " is the political label still applied to both Minneapolis and Minnesota . In 1938 youthful Harold Stassen broke the Farmer-Labor hold . In 1940 , political experts reasoned , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicanism . To their surprise , Roosevelt carried the city by 17,000 , the state by 47,000 . What happened to the pendulum ? As in every city sampled , Minneapolis ' vote broke primarily along economic lines . In the seven lowest-income wards , with rentals averaging under thirty dollars a month , Roosevelt won by better than two and a half to one . In the four wards with rentals from thirty to forty dollars a month , it was Roosevelt by seven to six . In the three wards where the rental average topped forty dollars , Willkie won by five to three . Roosevelt managed to squeeze through in one of these three wards by 8251 to 8066 . In the highest-income ward , Willkie 's margin fell just under three to one . One ward which helped check the pendulum 's swing was the tenth , where the late Floyd Olson , the Farmer-Labor leader , lived . A newer residential district lying near the north end of town , the ward scales about halfway on Minneapolis economic ladder . It scores seventh in relief canes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automobiles owned . In the precinct sampled , where Roosevelt led by two to one , virtually all the families own their homes . Mainly frame-and-stucco dwellings with sun-parlor porches , they fall into the FHA value range , from $4000 to $7000 . Most incomes run between $1800 and $2500 , with a goodly number of workers earning better than $3000 . High-school education for the children is about universal ; college rare . Roughly 70 per cent are of Norwegian or Swedish descent , the dominant nationalities in the city . Sympathy for Norway helped Roosevelt . Minneapolis is an AFL union city and probably 80 per cent of the workers in the precinct are unionized . Major occupations are the metal and building trades , trucking and driving milk wagons . Truckers and milk drivers belong to the Teamsters Union , which is popularly credited with running City Hall . Roosevelt made his first campaign speech before the Teamsters Convention in Washington , reminding the union of its progress in membership under the New Deal , from 70,000 to 400,000 . The Teamsters needed little reminding . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " friend " in the White House . The head of one precinct church with a number of teamsters in his congregation was outspoken in condemning the third term . He admitted bitterly , " I do n't suppose I changed a single vote . " As a footnote to the pendulum mystery , some birth-rate statistics can he cited . They show two great waves of births , the first between 1890 and 1900 , when the Scandinavians poured into the city , almost quadrupling the population ; the second , between 1911 and 1920 , when the children of those immigrants began bearing offspring . From that second wave have been coming the new voters . if Minneapolis continues to vote on economic lines , the future looks black for the Republicans . In 1937 a Minneapolis Council of Social Agencies study revealed that virtually all neighborhoods with 30 per cent or more of the population under fifteen ? the future voters ? were " proletarian or middle class . " The " gold coasts " had 15 per cent of their population under fifteen years of age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pendulum state . Black Republican by tradition , the state returned to the party in 1938 . In Philadelphia , to boot , the mayor was Republican . Yet Roosevelt swept the city by 177,000 . What seems to have happened emerges most clearly in the twenty-second ward . Both in 1938 and in 1940 the Republican vote stood at 31,000 . Roosevelt , though , ran 6000 votes ter than did the Democrats in 1938 . His vote of 20,000 was as great as in his record year of 1936 . IS hatever Roosevelt lost because of the third term was more than made up from new voters . In the first precinct , which Roosevelt carried nearly two to one , he increased his 1936 plurality . It is a typical Roosevelt neighborhood , with rentals ranging from thirty to forty-five dollars a month . Even after 1932 the precinct registered overwhelmingly Republican ; now the Democrats have a slight edge . Ward Committeeman Vincent Dean went down the precinct voters ' list . He picked out twenty-four families where someone had got a Government job since the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked off the new Democratic registrants  --  thirty-four , with twenty-four of them women . One , a seventy-year-old woman who receives a pension from the Government , had never voted before in her life . Two had recently been naturalized ; a third had come up from North Carolina . Three women were got out by their union-member husbands , a railroad man , a machinist , a cloth weaver . We checked the list for the size of families . The Republicans had twenty-three households with three or more voters ; the Democrats had forty-three . Since Roosevelt ran ahead of the Democratic registration , he may have got some of those big Republican families . One Democratic family , running through three generations , had fourteen voters . Two had been added in November . CHICAGO . Here , as expected , can he found the smoothest-working ward machine in the country . In the twenty-fourth ward , Jake Arvey , No. 3 man in the Kelly-Nash organization , delivered for Roosevelt 26,31 ? : to 1918 . Of greater significance for our national cross-section is a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enix , who sits in the slot of the copy desk on the Chicago Daily News , moved into the precinct more than twenty years ago , it was overwhelmingly Republican . Perhaps twenty Democratic votes out of 400 . For the most pert , the same families still live here . They went for Roosevelt three to two . In a few apartment houses on the corners rentals run from thirty-five to forty dollars . The rest of the precinct is made up of home owners . Enix knows each neighbor 's business  --  a landscape gardener , a retired plumber , a minor executive in a lumber company , two post-office employees , a pressman , a teacher , an auto mechanic , a widow with two sons working in Peoria . Incomes range , in the main , between $2500 and $3500 . Most of the children finish high school ; only the exceptions get to college . Asked how much the houses in the precinct are worth , Enix hedges a bit , then puts them at $5000 to $10,000 . The homes are old and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is looking forward to retiring , has no intention of selling . And it makes him feel better to think his house is worth more than less . At the bottom of the depression about half the workers in the precinct were unemployed . Now Enix knows of only one , and he is not in need . Enix 's daughter is married ; his son , Caleb , Jr. , is preparing to work for Uncle Sam as a radio operator . Caleb , Jr. , is twenty-four , and his idea of a good job is based on depression standards . " Any of the fellows around here can make money if they want to , " he explains . " I have a friend down the street who 's a salesman . He can make thirty-five dollars a week any time he wants to . " Three banks in the neighborhood failed and almost every family lost part of its savings . Many lost their homes ; others were hailed out by the HOLC . One of the shut bank buildings still stands . Its cashier windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Enix and his neighbors Seem to vote against those deserted cashier windows arid for those safety-deposit boxes . To them , Roosevelt means rescued savings and a promise of security . SEATTLE . Another middle-class sample of different composition , the Upper Broadway district here is an old , settled neighborhood . Its population is almost exclusively native white . In 1928 it went Hoover two to one ; in 1940 Roosevelt by three to two . Unlike Enix 's precinct , it is not a deeply rooted area of family residences . Once the fashionable part of the city , it now is being passed over for the automobile reaches near Lake Washington and the bluff overlooking Puget Sound . Many an old private residence has been converted into a duplex or a rooming house . In the last twenty years a number of medium-priced apartment houses have been erected . Rents average from thirty dollars to forty-five dollars a month . White-collar workers predominate . An afternoon 's interviewing yielded a municipal-transit employee , a telephone installer , a salesman , druggist , insurance agent , office manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cashier and chemist . Their incomes ran from $1500 to $2200 a year . The shops in the neighborhood , one and two stories high , fit typical middle-class needs  --  groceries , bakeries , hamburger spots , restaurants , filling stations , cabinetmakers , tailors . Some storekeepers live over their shops . PITTSBURGH . As our samples mount the economic ladder , Roosevelt 's margin of victory drops off . Two striking features about this " economic voting " stand out . BROOKLYN . From city to city the dividing line fluctuates somewhat . If we think of the economic voting as falling into horizontal strata , then there also have been vertical vote movements cutting across economic lines and lifting the Roosevelt vote . These , naturally , would he most evident in the dividing zone . As major influences of this sort could be listed : Organized labor reaching up into the better-paid skills . The Government , as an employer , sprinkling jobs through all middle-class groups . The whole body of New Deal benefits , from relief to FHA mortgage:3 . Precisely in this economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathies stirred by Hitlerism , as with the Jews , the Poles , the Scandinavians and the Czechs . Where these sympathies coincide with a low economic status , as with the Poles , the Roosevelt pluralities are enormous . Where they fall across higher economic rungs , like the ( Continued 017 Page 96 ) 96 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST January 25 , 1911 Continued from Page 941 better-income Jews , wards normally Republican swing Democratic or have their majorities cut , while Democratic-inclined wards go Roosevelt by landslide proportions . In Brooklyn 's Eighteenth Assembly District , Roosevelt won by about four to one , for a plurality of 70,000 . The neighborhood is 65 per cent Jewish and 25 per cent Irish Catholic . Perhaps one in three is foreign born . There are a few slum shacks ; there is a small Negro section ; in one corner of the district are walk-up tenements occupied chiefly by needle-trades workers . Onetime Socialists , they voted for Roosevelt on the American Labor Party ticket . But by far the great majority live in one and two family houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes are being built ; some 180,000 FHA homes were under way in the nation in 1940 ? or in modern apartment houses renting for forty-five to sixty-five dollars a month . These apartments have automatic elevators , mechanical refrigerators , tiled bathrooms , walled-in showers and , in most cases , a doorman . He is not the Park Avenue kind . The Eighteenth 's doormen are just middle-class , " keeping up with the Joneses " copies main , we find skilled workers , some professional people , fairly successful salesmen and , the largest category , small businessmen . Most incomes range between $3000 and $7000 , with the general level of living around $4000 . Even families earning less try to live on that scale . A considerable number of wives work , not because of careers or necessity , but to be able to maintain their " Joneses " living standards . Mostly , the voters are the sons and daughters  --  with the second generation coming up  --  of immigrants . They have risen from poverty . They now are straining to keep their upper-middleclass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the children they have are showered with attention . Babies of carriage age , before being taken into the street  --  at least twice a day  --  must be dressed up to pass the competitive inspection of the neighbors . At ten or eleven each morning , in front of any apartment house , the mothers may be seen , clad in fur coats , parading their babies . Apartments , in general , are three and four room , reflecting the predominance of young couples . If the nonworking , elderly group is ruled out , less than thirty-five would be an average age for breadwinners . Many are little businessmen who started in for themselves after 1933 . Those who prospered are loud in Roosevelt 's praise ; the others usually have got along with a struggle . Whether , ultimately , New Deal spending will force a write-off of their savings , thus far those savings have remained intact . Always there is the hope that one good season will ease all the strains . The fact that most of these people are brothers and sisters in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family react upon the others must be counted as one of the unseen factors favoring Roosevelt . Simply as a matter of numbers , these families are likely to have some member still struggling up the lower rungs where New Deal benefits are greatest . That would hold true for other middle-class elements  --  the Irish in Boston , for ex ample . By kinship and immigrant heritage , their sympathies are rooted in the underdog income levels where Roosevelt 's appeal is greatest . ST . LOUIS . From the 1880 's until the depression , the great industrial cities were magnets drawing in excess populations . The cities drew not only from abroad but from within our own borders , from the Midwest and South . St. Louis , for example , has only 10 per cent foreign born in its population . Yet here , too , we find the same inexorable spread of numbers , the same leveling that is going on in the other cities sampled . Republicans , with the aid of the automobile , have been abandoning St. Louis for the suburbs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote is excluded ? by . 23,000 . In his record-breaking year of 1936 his plurality dropped to 17,000 . By last November enough Republicans had been transplanted for Willkie to win the county by 15,000 . St. Louis city has become almost entirely working class . Roosevelt took every ward but one where there happens to be a strong Negro Republican machine . Perhaps the last outposts of St. Louis ' vanishing Republicans lie in the twenty-eighth ward , the old silk-stocking district . In 1932 , the GOP carried the ward ; in November they held only three precincts . Along Lindell Boulevard and Skinker Road , the old , imposing homes still stand , mansion-like in design , with graveled driveways , flagstone walks , antique-fabricated lampposts , spreading trees and spacious lawns . On many a lawn and tree , though , is a " for sale " sign . All through the swankier streets homes are for sale . Apartments which once brought $125 a month now go for sixty and seventy-five dollars ; homes that cost $50,000 have been halved in pricer though the ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the city . Fine old residences are being razed to make way for apartments . Along Delmar Boulevard the beauty parlors are cutting prices ; a custom-built up-. holsterer advertises an " income purchase plan . " Once , at the Pageant Theater , the neighborhood movie , seats were reserved . Now , on Wednesdays and Thursdays double features are shown for fifteen cents ; on Fridays and Saturdays three features for a quarter . HARLEM . How great has been the impact of this urban revolt upon the traditional Republican line-up can be seen in the Negro vote . Only in St. Louis , which continues to draw them from the South , do the Negroes still seem divided in their allegiances between the party of Lincoln and the party of Roosevelt . Harlem 's Seventeenth Assembly District went better than seven to one for the New Deal . Probably 50 per cent of Harlem 's Negroes are getting relief of some kind . Older Negroes  --  they 're most likely to be Republican  --  shake their graying heads ruefully and mutter , " Our people are selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the younger Negroes the WPA and relief mean not only material aid but a guaranty that no longer must they work at any salary given them , that they are entitled  --  they emphasize the word  --  to a living wage . Through the WPA , Harlem 's Negroes have had opened to them white-collar opportunities which before had been shut , such as the music and art and writers ' projects . Negroes , too , remember that Mrs. Roosevelt visited Harlem personally , that President Roosevelt has appointed more Negroes to administrative positions paying around $5000 a year than any President before him . Each time Roosevelt makes such an appointment , the Amsterdam News , Harlem 's leading newspaper , headlines it in 72-point type . Every young Negro gets a vicarious thrill thinking , " There may he a chance up there for me . " Harlem definitely has grown class as well as race conscious . Last year the Seventeenth for the first time got a Negro installed us Democratic leader of the district .
