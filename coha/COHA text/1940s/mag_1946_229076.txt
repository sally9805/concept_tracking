From Berlin , TIME Correspondent Jack Fleischer reported : <P> Two weeks ago a huge billboard covered with propaganda posters of the Soviet-backed Socialist Unity Party ( SED ) attracted unusual attention in the heart of bomb-shattered Dresden in the Russian zone . Plastered squarely in the center of the billboard was a red poster bearing the slogan : " Wir haben kein Papier , aber wir sind auch hier " ( We have no paper , but we are also here ) . The poster was signed by the anti-Communist Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) . Firemen soon tore down the poster , but thousands of Dresdeners had enjoyed a good chuckle . <P> The incident typified the political situation as Germans in the Soviet zone prepared to vote last week in the first " free and democratic " elections since 1933 . On the surface all political parties and organizations like trade unions , which are recognized by the Soviet military administration , had equal rights in the campaign . In practice the dice were loaded heavily in favor of the Socialist Unity Party . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone so far as to refer to the Socialist Unity Party as the " Staatspartei " ( state party ) . After all , it is the outgrowth of last Easter 's Russian-backed merger of Communists and Social Democrats in the Russian zone and Berlin . <P> Rare as a Swastika . The Dresden billboard incident points up only one of many direct and indirect methods the Russians have employed to give the SED maximum advantages over the other two parties , CDU and Liberal Democrats ( LDP ) . Lampposts , streetcars , newspaper kiosks , billboards and public buildings scream with SED campaign posters throughout the Russian zone , but CDU and LDP posters are almost as rare as a swastika . In the Land of Saxony , the SED has a daily newspaper with a million circulation . The LDP organ , appearing thrice weekly , has 50,000 circulation and the CDU newspaper , with 35,000 circulation , is published only twice weekly . <P> Election regulations specify that each party or organization can put up its own candidate list only in communities where it has a local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizations in most communities . The other two parties lag far behind . The SED people have little difficulty getting automobiles and gasoline . Other parties are largely immobile . In Saxony , the SED was recently allotted 30,000 liters of gasoline , the LDP 100 liters . <P> Officially all parties must obtain permission of the local German authorities or Russian commander to hold meetings ; speakers and speeches must be approved by the Russians . The interminable list of SED rallies indicates that the party has little trouble obtaining permits . Other parties , as one discouraged CDU leader put it , " run into endless chicanery . " He added : " It has developed into quite a set pattern . We plan a meeting and tentatively reserve a hall . We submit application for the meeting , but days and sometimes weeks elapse . By the time we receive the approval our hall has been taken by somebody else-for instance , the Red Army requisitions it for showing a movie . "                @ @ @ @ @
