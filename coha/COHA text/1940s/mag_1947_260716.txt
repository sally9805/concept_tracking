This was Britain 's year for Nobel Prizes in science . Last week the committee of eminent Swedes , which passes out the $40,588 awards , gave the 1947 physics and chemistry prizes to Sir Edward Victor Appleton and Sir Robert Robinson-both big names in science but little known to the U.S. man in the street . <P> Pre-Radar . Sir Edward , 55 , Secretary of Britain 's Department of Scientific and Industrial Research , is an outstanding authority on radio waves . He is the father of two daughters ( Rosalind , 20 , dances in the Anglo-Polish Ballet ) , a detective-story fan , likes golf , his garden and piano , and is a fairly regular churchgoer . Appleton 's probings in the upper atmosphere , where he located two layers of ionized gases , resulted in the first use of reflected radio waves to measure the distance of an unseen object . Just in time for World War II , the technique developed into Britain 's secret weapon : radar . <P> Life Chemicals . Sir Robert , 61 , an ardent mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ancient &; honorable Royal Society , is an organic chemist whose forte is exploring the intricate compounds found in living organisms . He synthesized the delicate substances which color fruits and flowers . He put together artificial sex hormones more powerful than the natural ones . At present he and his chemist-wife Gertrude Maud , whom he met in a laboratory , are working on the production of synthetic penicillin . Organic chemists admire Sir Robert as a master of laboratory strategy . Biochemists honor him for pioneering in the mysterious chemistry of life .
