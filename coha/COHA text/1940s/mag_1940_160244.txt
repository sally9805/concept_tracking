A typical small-town newspaper is the News-Commercial , published in Collins , Miss . ( pop . 1,100 ) by a typical smalltown editor : Mayor and onetime Lawyer James Duncan Arlington . Unlike many another small-town newspaper , the four-page , weekly News-Commercial ( circulation : 1,350 ) does not take itself too seriously . Once it printed a list of delinquent subscribers under the head : " Shall the Dead Live Again ? " Lately it quipped editorially : " We see ... where they have started a new kind of paper the tabloid , PM in New York . No advertisements will be carried in it . There ai n't nothing new about that idea-we have been darn near running that kind of paper* for ten years . " <P> The whimsical News-Commercial recently published some ads for the fun of it . Smeared across two columns on Page 1 were a series of advertisements which Editor Arrington printed to " wake up " the people of Mississippi . Samples : <P> &gt;WANTED-48 STATES IN AMERICA , A. Hitler and Co .. Berlin , Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Per Mile . In actual tests made in Belgium and France , tanks and airplanes using Nazi No-Stop gasoline averaged 5,000 dead men , women and children per mile . <P> &gt;MALE HELP WANTED-Our organization due to recent expansion is in need of additional men in the United States . Applicants must be opposed to democratic forms of government . Apply in own handwriting to : Fifth Column , c/o German Embassy , Washington , D. C. <P> &gt;FOR SALE-200 MILES OF MAGINOT LINE .

Actually 50 to 70% of News-Commercial space is advertising .
