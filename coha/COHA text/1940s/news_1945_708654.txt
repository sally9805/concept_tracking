txt Fighting is only a part of modern war , as any doughfoot can testify after a few months in a front area handling stores on a sandy beach in the rain or pushing a bulldozer through the jungle on a twelve-hour trick . Construction is a large part of the battle . And here we have a major advantage over the Japanese . Americans are machineminded . The Japanese are not . Even given a choice , they appear to prefer to do a job by hand . What has been called " our good left arm , " the bulldozer , has performed another miracle on Okinawa . A month and a half after our troops splashed ashore through the surf to the major island of the Ryukyu chain , and while the fighting still goes on , Okinawa has been converted into a major military base . Predicting an end to the fighting in a short time , Admiral Richard Kelly Turner , the amphibious commander of the operation , reports that hundreds of miles of hard-surfaced roads have been built in the central part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are operating from which planes take off daily to attack or reconnoiter the Japanese home islands , the rest of the Ryukyu chain and Formosa , which also is being pounded by fighters and bombers fly-. ing from airfields on Luzon in the Philippines . Okinawa now is at , or nearing the point , where it can furnish all its own air protection and also keep neutralized the enemy air bases within striking distance . This frees our carrier forces to proceed to some new order of business . A study of the official communiqu  --  s since May 1 shows the steady development of the situation in a pattern made familiar in our other island campaigns . The Japanese have been able to launch only two air attacks in force on our invasion fleet anchorages over the last twenty days . These were on May 4 and May 11 . On both occasions they suffered the loss of most of the attacking planes . One hundred and sixty eight were reported destroyed in the May 4 attack and ninety-three on May 11 . On most of the other days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planes have been able to get through to damage American ships . Typical of recent days off Okinawa was that of May 15 . Twelve enemy planes attempted to attack that day , the communiqu ? said . Nine were shot down by Okinawa-based fighters . The others fled . Two days ago thirty-five came in on what the communiqu ? described as a low-level attack , which would indicate an attack with torpedoes . Twenty-six were shot down . Five of our small units were damaged . Since May 1 the communiqu  --  s have reported no major American war vessel either sunk or damaged off the Okinawa beachheads . Enemy planes destroyed total hundreds . As the Admiral says , our forces have n't just been " sitting and taking it . " Bravery alone will not win wars . Nor will fanaticism . To win you have to know how to fight , but you also have to know how to build . That is one of the great weaknesses of the Japanese ; they do n't , or can not . Our forces do .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
