The time had come for a change of daylight tactics . The old way was terribly expensive . The Regensburg-Schweinfurt raid had cost 59 planes ; the second Schweinfurt raid had cost 60 . Percentage of casualties had gone up to over 10% . No matter how precious the targets , the flyers and the fleets could not stand such losses . The Germans had come up with new rocket-bearing fighters which could lurk outside the range of U.S. .50-caliber machine guns . Flak was getting thicker . <P> Being attacked by the enemy under these conditions had become a nightmare of exploding planes and disappearing friends . Lieut . Colonel Beirne Lay Jr . described the sensations and sights of the Regensburg raid in last week 's Saturday Evening Post : " A shining silver rectangle of metal sailed past over our right wing . I recognized it as a main-exit door . Seconds later , a black lump came hurtling through the formation , barely missing several propellers . It was a man , clasping his knees to his head , revolving like a diver in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw a piece of paper blow out of his leather jacket . He was evidently making a delayed jump . . . . A B-17 turned gradually out of the formation to the right , maintaining altitude . In a split second it completely vanished in a brilliant explosion , from which the only remains were four balls of fire , the fuel tanks , which were quickly consumed as they fell earthward . . . . " <P> A Better Way . Up to last week , the daylight bombers had depended mainly on their own fire power for defense . But the U.S. Eighth Air Force worked out new tactics . Last week it tried them and found them good . They involved a combination of two principles : fighter escort all the way to the target , coordination with a whole pattern of associated attacks . <P> The day of the trial broke clear and sunny , with high-riding white clouds over the English Channel and western Europea fine day for finding the way and losing the enemy . The pattern began with a feint at France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airfields at Tricque-ville and St. Andr-de-1'Eure . This sucked fighters away from the Lowlands in time for 550 Fortresses and Liberators-the largest U.S. heavy bomber force ever used-to cut for Wilhelm shaven with upwards of 1,200 tons of bombs . With that huge force were U.S. fighter types which made the escort possible-450 Thunderbolts and long-range Lightnings , all carrying belly tanks . As this mass attack returned and German fighters settled again on Lowlands fields , Marauders hit them there-at Schiphol near Amsterdam . <P> Then the R.A.F. promptly took up the flail . A force hit Cologne at about 8 p.m . A few minutes later another force , much bigger , hit Dsseldorf for 27 minutes , during which more than 2,000 tons were dropped . <P> In all that terrible day only 26 bombers and five fighters were lost . In the heavy Wilhelmshaven raid only five of 550 bombers did not return . Two days later another coordinated series of punches , climaxed by another massive Fortress-Liberator raid on the synthetic oil center of Gelsenkirchen , cost the Allies only ten heavies , two Marauders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raid on Dren , coordinated with diversionary attacks , was accomplished without the loss of a single bomber .
