Unity for the United Nations <P> Sirs : <P> In your Feb. 15 issue , it seems to me you are unduly exciting your readers by telling them that the United Nations are not yet united after 13 months of war . <P> Has the joint declaration by the United Nations , which was dated Jan. 1 , 1942 at Washington , been rescinded by its signers , which included all nations now fighting the Axis ? Or do their pledges mutually to employ their full resources , both military and economic , against members of the Tripartite Pact and not to make a separate peace mean nothing ? <P> RICHARD C. FORBES <P> Albany , N.Y . <P> &gt; It takes more than a declaration to unite nations . It took more than the Declaration of Independence to make the U.S. independent . TIME , in reporting that the United Nations are not yet united after 13 months of war , was not trying to excite its readers , but to inform them. - ED . <P> Messages to Marines <P> Sirs : <P> Please tell me how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in TIME , Feb. 8 , which sends messages to Marines from their families and friends . <P> MRS . JOHN SNELL <P> Yonkers , N.Y . <P> &gt; Write to Tell it to the Marines , c/o Office of War Information , 224 West 57 Street , New York City. - ED . <P> Bath , Aleutian Style <P> ( Excerpts from a letter received by J. C. Pry or , of Omaha . ) <P> Sirs : <P> I find that I am the least sleepingest and most workingest guy in the whole army . ( You would probably find about 6,000,000 other liars who said they were-but we know better . ) Not only am I the most workingest guy , but I am the least bathingest guy . Nothing would please me more than to see all of the male population of the U.S. have themselves a Saturday bath , Aleutian style . It is really quite simple and most effective . It 's so effective that it practically kills you . It 's done like this .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
