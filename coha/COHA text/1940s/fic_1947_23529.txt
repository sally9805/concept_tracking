THE MISFORTUNES OF THE FLAPJACKS A Story ISAAC ROSENFELD I WAS the trainer with the Flapjacks in the One Eye League until my own arm went dead and I could n't massage arms , shoulders , backs , and legs any more . I 'm still with the Flapjacks and they still call me Doc , though I 'm absolutely no use to them . I spend my time on the bench catching a little sun ; every now and then I help the park attendants fix the bases and the foul lines , clear up the infield after batting practice , or pick up papers in the outfield before and after games . Otherwise I ca n't feel I 'm being useful . The boys come to me with broken fingers , concussions , spike wounds , rheumatism , sprains ; all I do is apply some iodine and a bandage and tell them to go to a doctor on club expense . This works out well enough when we 're at home . The local veterinary likes the team  --  or else he likes to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us up free of charge . But when we 're on the road , we 're just out of luck . There is no money , no one has been paid for the longest time . The club owners dropped us in the middle of the season . They put us up for sale , but no one came around to buy so we 're on our own . It 's a good thing the owners paid in advance a whole season 's fare on the railroad and rent at the hotels , or we 'd have been stuck . You wo n't find another team in the whole country that 's had our kind of tough breaks . Ticky Wamburger , our manager , is a madman , really out of his mind  --  this is not just an expression . Three of our starting pitchers have sore arms and the fourth has an ear infection , on account of which he ca n't keep his balance on the mound , falls down every second pitch and gets confused , often throwing his best stuff to first or third instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has gone hitless now for two and a half months and his average is down to .071 , We 've run out of bats  --  we left a whole stock of them in Pokegan on our last trip and have been dickering with the Pokegan Eagles to get them back , but no dice . Now there are only five bats left , and all of them are chipped and rough and out of shape and developing cracks . What else ? Spud Pickerel , our shortstop , caught the flu and for awhile we tried to play without a shortstop , with only eight men in the game , because none of the boys could be talked into playing short , they were afraid of the errors they 'd make ; but that was impossible , even for us , as the opposing teams kept poking the ball through short and piling up runs and there was no putting them out ; one game had to be called on account of darkness before the third inning was over . I 'm ashamed of the scores  --  in one four-game series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and our worst licking was at the hands of the Green Lake Trappers , a second di-vision team , who crossed the plate 38 times in a single game . We put in our mascot at short , a fourteen-year-old boy , and that made a big difference right away as the runs against us dropped to around 25 . But then the mascot gat hit by a pitched ball and was too scared to play , so Pickerel went back into the game before he had recovered , and now he has a bad cough which breaks out every time he stoops for a ball , and that takes care of him . We are the laughing stock of the League . o uk manager has always been a queer bird , so it took us a while to discover that he 'd really gone crazy . The kind of talks he 'd give us in the dugout before games always had us in stitches . He 'd say , " Men , I want you to grickle on the splakker by the top . Cut it on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which did us more good than any plain talk would have done , because with a team as bad off as the Flapjacks , what 's the use ? But then he began to talk plain to us , and that had us worried . He 'd keep us for hours when we should have been out at batting practice , and talk on and on , and it seemed to make sense , but in a queer sort of way it really did n't . He got himself a little blackboard and some chalk and began to draw diagrams , and he 'd say , " Now look here . They 've got runners on first and third.and nobody out with the score tied . A run can score on a fly , on an infield out , on most anything , and if we try to cut the run off at the plate , unless they 've got the hit and run on , the man on third will stay put and that 'll load the bases . Best thing in this case is a strike-out . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turkey , play close to third , Pickerel play back , Sammy move over closer to second , and Chuck , never mind first base , get in there close to the box and cover the pitcher . Clyde can watch the outfield from behind the plate and move ' em around . Remember , I want the center fielder in close , and the other boys to hug the foul lines , and everybody to concentrate , look hard at the back of the pitcher 's head . " Or else he 'd begin to work on the problem of how to make a double play with nobody on base . Werealized he was crazy , and we felt sorry for him and a little guilty because we thought the tough luck had gone to his head . As things got worse and we kept dropping games , Ticky seemed to improve . He cut his talks short and there seemed to be less nonsense in them . He went about encouraging us , patting the men on the shoulder and putting in a kind word for everybody . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the going was worse and worse . Well , there 's nothing particularly crazy about that  --  it 's the only way for a manager to act when the situation 's hopeless , so we thought Ticky was on the mend and we felt much better about him . We 'd been afraid that the word would get out that he 'd gone off the beam , and then we really would have caught it from the fans , so we breathed much easier now . But then he began to do queer things again . He 'd hold his breath , and he got so that he could hold it almost all the while that we were at bat  --  which I must say was never too long , as we did n't get any hits . He started to knock wood and to carry a rabbit 's foot in his hip packet ; he had a horseshoe nailed over each man 's locker and he fined some of the boys for whistling before games . ( It was impossible to collect fines with no money in the club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more superstitious and jumpy and nervous , and all the time he kept encouraging us , praising us and whacking our shoulders , jumping about and hollering , with his eyes shining and his smile full of pride . It turned out that he thought we were on a winning streak . We read about it in the paper when we got back from a road trip . Ticky had given an interview to our town newspaper in which he claimed we 'd set a record for consecutive games won ? " and the end not yet in sight ! " he was quoted as saying . The paper treated it as a big joke and was glad to see that they could still get some fun out of us , for they 'd given us up and just about stopped covering our games . That stirred up the home town a bit and people came round to see us play for a week or so , we had some money again and the boys got some of the back pay that was coming to them . But all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The truth was we had set a record for consecutive games lost , with the end not yet in sight  --  and there was Wamburger hopping about the field with his face red from holding his breath , and everybody laughing at him . It was a great joke while it lasted , but everybody got tired of it , and then no one came to see us play any more . When folks wanted to see a game , they 'd drive over to Pokegan , or they 'd watch the kids in the sandlot , who I can tell you were a damn sight better than us . The paper ran a big ad on the front page saying they were open to bids from contractors to build a new cellar low enough to hold the ' Jacks . That finished us . The season was nearly over anyway , so the boys began to drop off the team and go home , and we were left with no more than a dozen players to finish the remaining games . I CA N'T understand what got into Ticky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind from managing a bunch of stumblebums , unless he was going to lose it anyway . Get sore , yes , get mean and nasty , yes , and yes , go round with a sneer and an evil look and get into fights , or even say the hell with it and quit . But to go crazy just on account of us , that does n't seem right . We 're not worth it . There was n't a dry eye when Ticky , in the charge of a doctor , left us , saying he was going off to get tickets printed for the series . The boys were all broken up , and the next two games they put on a show , winning them both , the first game for Ticky and the second for me , who had taken his place as acting manager . They really went out there and played ball , and bad as they were , they made it hum ; the pitchers threw their hearts out , the infield was tight as a drum , the outfield made some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good old days , and everybody got a hit  --  except Eglantine , our slugger . But they could n't keep it up , and I was glad in a way , because I could n't stand to have them playing their heads off for Ticky and me ; for Ticky because it was too sad , and for me , because I did n't rate it . I 'm no manager . Maybe I do know a few things about the game , I 've been around long enough , God knows , butwhen it came to managing the Flapjacks , I just did n't have it in me , and I told them to go out there and play and do what they thought best , from now on they were on their own . Well , there are only two and a half weeks left to the season , and as soon as we get back from this trip we 'll have ten days at home , and then it 's quits . What 's going to happen to us , I do n't know . I doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of the boys will go back home , on the farm , in town . Maybe some of them will open filling stations . We wo n't be seeing each other . I hate to think of what will happen to the ones who still want to play . They 'll hang around the clubs , the training camps , and the playing fields in the hope that someone will pick them up , but no one will . Maybe two or three will get on some team and go barnstorming through the South in winter , but when the season starts again , unless they 've really burned up the bases and played heartbreak ball while everyone else was taking it easy , they 'll be cut off and become baseball bums  --  a special kind of bum who hangs around the parks trying to cadge a ticket or sneak in , and so much the worse for him if someone who knows the game cold recognizes him and says , " Say , you 're so-and-so , you played left field on the Flapjacks , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of pity . The Flapjacks are through . Mittsville , where they make pancake flour , has been trying to buy its way into the One Eye League for years , and now , with us out of the way , they 'll get up a team for sure , and call it the Mittsville Millers and take our place , you watch and see , and soon no one will even remember the ' Jacks , unless the fans make up a baseball joke and everytime there 's an error that could have been an easy out , they 'll yell " Flapjacks ! " Even so , no one will remember us . T HE other night when we were staying at the Double Elk Hotel in Salt Creek where we had just dropped four games to the Salt Creek Ranchers , the manager of the hotel came up to me , and I thought we were going to have some trouble with the bill , but it turned out that the Flapjack owners , before they threw us away , had paid up too far in advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as everybody knew that there was n't going to be a next season for us , the hotel owed us money . Did we want a check for the difference ? The hotel manager was very proud of his honesty and he made his offer loud enough for all the boys who were sitting in the lobby to hear him . Did we want a check , or maybe we would like a party that the hotel would throw us for the difference , in recognition of our long services to baseball , and the good sports and clean players we had all been . ( All the same , I think they were offering to split the difference with us , for the check was only for about $250 , and it seems to me that if the owners had paid up far in advance there ought to have been more money . ) Two hundred and fifty dollars , split twelve ways , would n't have made much difference to the boys , only about twenty bucks apiece , but twenty bucks ' worth of party , that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was small and not much of a banquet room , except for a high ceiling and red velvet curtains . The hotel unloaded a lot of old beer on us that was beginning to turn stale , some raw liquor , and sandwiches that must have been left over from somebody 's wedding . They did n't bother with tablecloths or napkins , so the hotel saved on linen , too , We tried to get drunk , but it was no go . Some of the boys tried to get hold of girls from the town , and they turned up with five sad looking creatures , three old waitresses , a girl from the hat factory , and one from the laundry . We had only a radio to dance to , and no one wanted to dance with the girls , we did it so as not to hurt their feelings . But what really spoiled the party was when the Ranchers somehow got wind of what was up and they all crashed , including their manager , Eddie Forbes . They came trooping in all at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tanned and in top condition , looking like athletes even in their town clothes . They brought their girls with them , the prettiest in the town , and the girls laughed at us and said , " Some party , some team . " The Ranchers crowded us out at the table and on the dance floor , and pretty soon we were forced into a corner while they were whooping it up and having a hell of a time and bragging how they 'd just whipped us four straight without once dropping a game to us all season , and how they had a winning streak on , nine games long , and they would whip the rest of the League and beat the Badgers out of first place . That started a fight and the table was overturned , the beer and liquor were spilled , the sandwiches got thrown around , the velvet curtains were torn , the place was a shambles in no time , two of our players got injuries that would lay them up for several days and not one of theirs got so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls got a bloody nose . We took the milk train out of town at two in the morning and the hotel manager and the sheriff were down at the station to see that we all got on , and the sheriff was swearing he 'd run us in if we ever showed up in town again . Would n't you know it ? We were in such a hurry to get out of there that we did n't think where we were going and we wound up at dawn in Carrington , forty miles out of the way . I tried to get the railroad to take us back , but they would n't do it for nothing , as we had just made an unscheduled trip . I argued and pleaded in the office while the boys sat beaten in the waiting room , but it was nothing doing . We did n't have enough money for fare , and the railroad would n't advance us anything , or trust us , and they did n't care where our schedule called for us to be that day . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go and ship you free , or I 'll be sticking my own neck out , " said the station master , and I suppose he was right . We wandered about town with our suitcases and our bats , not knowing where to go or what would happen to us . The truth was we were hungry , but we did n't even have enough money for a decent breakfast for the team . W E WERE all set to stand on the road and try to get a lift out of town , when I got the idea that maybe we could start up an exhibition game . There was no baseball team in Carrington , but the high school had a team , and as it was late in the season , maybe school had started and we could play the high school team . I went over to the school and talked to the coach . I did n't tell him everything , just that we were in town for the day and would like to put on a show for the kids , if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure , the kids would love it , only we must remember they were n't in our class and it would n't be much of a game . I said we 'd be willing to take our chances on that and maybe we 'd spot them a few runs . No , said the coach , the kids would n't like that . A straight game or nothing . That 's all right with us , I told him , we 're straight players , and anyway we 're just doing it for the love of the game and because we think it is a good idea to go out to the small towns every now and then and bring some real baseball to the young boys and girls of the nation . Only we 'd like to get enough out of it to cover our fare . The coach said there 'd be a scandal if they charged admission on the school grounds , he 'd been warned about it , but he did n't think any one would object if we passed the hat , it was all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager to play us , and even felt honored in a way . Carrington is far enough east to take an interest in the major leagues , so maybe he had no idea what was doing with the One Eye teams . I sent a wire to Flood River Valley where we were supposed to play that day , saying that we were delayed and would arrive in time to play a double-header on the next day . Then I told the boys what the arrangement was , and asked them to take it easy and not to show off and let the kids get some runs . We had n't had much to eat that day , so we were pretty hungry and weak when we took to the field in the afternoon . Soon we were fighting for our lives . We made two runs in the first , but the kids got onto us and got over being nervous , and in the third inning they scored eight runs and we had our work cut out to catch up with them . We tied the score by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ninth and beat us , 9 to 8 . It was one of the closest games we had played all year , and I think we would have beaten them if we had n't been so hungry . A good thing wepassed the hat before the game started , while the fans still had some respect for us . W ELL , only another two and a half weeks . It hardly pays to last it out , we might as well concede the remaining games . It 's curtains . But it 's hard to get used to the fact that we 're through . We 're still wearing our uniforms , with the red circle on the chest and the red caps and stockings , and they still look good on us even though they 're torn and dirty and our other uniforms got lost in the laundry . We still look like ball players , even the men who are close to forty and gray and have pot bellies . It 's hard to imagine that we 'll take off our suits and , never put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Even some of our younger players , when they want to smoke during a game , sneak cigarettes to one another so I should n't see , although they know I do n't give a damn , and they can smoke and drink and shoot craps in the dugout for all I care . I still have the baseball habit myself , and as I watch the game from the dugout , every now and then I have a hunch of some kind  --  Sam Perkins to pinch hit for Smith , move MacDonald out to center and let Forest play first , put in the left-hander , take out Coogan because they 're pitching a southpaw , call a squeeze play , a steal , a bunt . I never play these hunches , but I ca n't help having them , and as I sit on the bench or walk out to the bull pen , or even when I 'm asleep at night in the hotel room , I go on getting hunches and ideas . I keep making plans , I still wish I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some way . Right now it 's Eglantine 's turn to bat . He walks up to the plate swinging all five of our bats , and selects one , a black , chubby stick . I should have benched him long ago , he got only nineteen hits all season and his average is down to nothing . The loudspeaker ought to be saying , ATTENTION PLEASE : FOR THE FLAPJACKS , COOPER BATTING FOR EGLANTINE . But he steps into the box , draws back his shoulders and sticks out his left leg as he used to do in the old days when he was knocking down the fence . He wags his bat , a slow , menacing motion , his elbows are cocked , his teeth are clenched in the tobacco plug , he is stocky and muscular , a powerful man . The pitcher grins and floats the first one over , just hands it to him right across the middle , and Eglantine twists all the way around on a murderous swing , but a mile wide , he ca n't connect any more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is right in the same place with nothing on it , you can count the stitches on the ball , and Eglantine knocks the air out of the park as he misses it and goes down twisting like a recoiling spring . Our best hitter , who once led the League at .389 ? he stands there , working his jaws and wagging the bat , waiting to strike out , and I can feel all the power in his shoulders and forearms and wrists , his muscles straining to connect . I see his eyes squint as the ball sails towards him , and there is that last , pinched strain of energy in his face as he begins his wild swing  --  and I think , God damn it , all that power and that glary gone to waste . Gold and Silver Morning SYLVIA STALLINGS M Y NEIGHBOR in Virginia has a roan stallion And a house set among apple trees ; His front door is a frame for half the county And a river hurrying down to the hungry seas . Wheat and barley clash together like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drink At noon under the shadow of locust thickets ; At dusk when the first white star begins to wink . They can hear him shouting over in Carolina On a clear day , when the hot teams strain Up toward the barn with a hundred bales of hay And jingle back to the bottom-grounds again . I am tired of men with handkerchiefs and ties And neat white faces above folded hands ; I would rather a man who curses with Irish rage The river rising above his meadow-lands . Although his roof leaks and his fences reel , There 's all blue day before him when he wakes , And passion enough to hammer a new world Until life runs out or the heart breaks .
