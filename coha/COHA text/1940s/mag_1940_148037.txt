The Hunchback of Notre Dame ( RKO ) is a more spectacular remake of an old horror film in which the late Lon ( Man of a Thousand Faces ) Chancy , with the help of an elaborately repulsive makeup , set a standard for cinema frightfulness hard to beat . So hard , that the more repulsive make-up ( by Perc Westmore ) with which British Cinemactor Charles Laughton proposed to beat it was a devoutly cherished secret of this production . Thirty-four pounds lighter than Lon Chaney 's , Laughton 's make-up consists of a sponge-rubber right cheek and false eye socket , which covers Laughton 's own right eye , keeps his face drawn in a deformed grim ace . How the false eye , which is much lower in the face than Laughton 's real eye , winks and blinks is Make-up-man Westmore 's secret , and he will not tell . <P> Even more amazing is the make-up magic by which Westmore somehow transfers burly , bulging Cinemactor Laughton 's paunch to his shoulder . <P> Charles Laughton 's contribution is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quasimodo not only monstrous but pitiably human . <P> Produced by Pandro S. Berman ( Gunga Din , Michael Strogoff ) , the picture has big milling mobs , the Cathedral of Notre Dame ( with close-ups of Gothic sculpture ) , some of the year 's choicest bits of sadism ( a flogging , a racking , an unsuccessful hanging ) , a pitched battle on the cathedral steps , and darkly witching Maureen O'Hara , last seen in a den of cut throats in Jamaica Inn , here seen in a den of cutthroats in medieval Paris . <P> It also has ( for the first time in movies ) veteran Actor Walter Hampden as the archdeacon of Victor Hugo 's novel , now called the archbishop for the greater glory of the cinema . Walter Hampden , who heretofore has been suspected of scorning movies as beneath the dignity of U. S. Shakespearean Actor No. 1 , made the great concession and this picture for $15,000 . <P> Highest high jinks : Charles Laughton having himself a wonderful time in the turret of Notre Dame , playing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ropes , dropping building blocks and raining a vast cauldron of molten lead through gargoyles ' mouths down on his fellow citizens in the square below .
