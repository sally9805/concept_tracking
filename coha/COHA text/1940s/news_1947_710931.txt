txt spectai to Tax N WASHINGTON , Dec. 6 ? New Yorkers may have seen what looked like a depression nightmare this week when 4,000 men waited for hours in the cold to apply for 1,000 city day-laborer jobs . But placed against the background of the nation 's best peacetime unemployment record , the bad dream dissolves into a line of men simply looking for more secure jobs at better pay than the ones they already have . Today there are 58,594,000 people at work in the United States . There are 1,621,000 people unemployed and looking for jobs , a figure representing less than 3 per cent of the current total labor force ( including military ) of 62,000,000 . This is described by United States Employment Service officials as " rock bottom " unemployment , a virtually irreducible percentage consisting primarily of people in the process of shifting from one job to another . Even last July , when nation-wide employment stood at its peacetime record of 60,079,000 , unemployed persons numbered 2,584,000 .

As a matter of fact , employment service officials guess that next spring the normal seasonal upturn in employment , plus the impact of ERP , might give the United States its greatest peacetime employment record in history . Whether these factors could combine to reduce unemployment below the 3 per cent level is debatable , but certainly job opportunities would be expanded and it is unlikely that the unemployment percentage would rise .

Labor Turnover nigh There are several noteworthy factors in the unemployment that does exist . First , it is spotty and individualistic ; there is no reduced employment trend noticeable in any labor field , not even luxury trades and amusements , the first areas to feel an economic pinch . Further , labor turnover is still high , . apparently because people are constantly seeking jobs with higher pay to meet the rising cost of living . Another factor is that labor is not flowing from the " loose " to the " tight " areas because housing is not available in the labor-hungry regions . " Everything points to an even stronger and tighter situation than we have now , " Mr. Goodwin reports .
