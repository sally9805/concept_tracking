But it was the village children who stole the show . They touched the hearts of the American soldiers standing in the flower bedecked village square and brought tears to the eyes of French women . The chit. dren , gathered before the fluttering flags of two nations , sang " America . " For weeks they tried to learn the " Star Spangled Banner , " but they could not master the difficult tune . One boy spoke to the children of America . " We children of liberated France wish to tell you of the joy with which our hearts are overflowing , " he said .

We hope they come back to you safe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
