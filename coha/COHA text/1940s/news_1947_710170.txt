Closed Meeting Stormy Joint committee 's report on Federal budget cut , Page 3 . By JOHN D. MORRIS Special to THE New Yonx TIMES . WASHINGTON , Feb. 14 The Joint Congressional Committee on the Budget recommended today a $6,000,000,000 reduction in President Truman 's $37,500,000,000 budget for the fiscal year 1948 . The action overrode repeated bipartisan efforts to moderate the cut . The final vote was 50 to 22 , with thirty members of the 102-man group either absent or failing to least ballots . The issue now goes to the House land Senate floors for a showdown , ' with opponents of so severe a cut prepared to renew the fight there . Approval by both chambers would impose a moral obligation upon Congress to limit appropriations to a figure which would limit Federal spending during the fiscal year beginning July 1 to $31,500 , - 000,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going above the ceiling . Revenues Set at 39.1 Billion The resolution estimates fiscal 1948 revenues at $39,100,000,000 as compared with President Truman 's estimate of $37,700,000,000 . Its proposal for a $31,500,000,000 spending ceiling , according to Republican sponsors , would permit a 20 per cent reduction in income taxes this year at an estimated revenue loss of $3,500,000,000 , clear the way for a payment on the national debt of an equal amount , and leave $600,000,000 leeway . Democratic and Republican opponents , however , fought to the end of an all-day session behind closed doors for a less drastic budget reduction on the ground that a $6,000,000,000 cut would endanger national security by necessitating a $1,750,000,000 cut in President Truman 's $11,200,000,000 request for the Army and Navy defense activities and $500,000,000 in his $1,000,000,000 request for War Department civil functions . The crucial vote came during the afternoon when Senator Eugene D. Millikin of Colorado moved for a compromise on a budget reduction of $4,500,000,000 . The effort caused a collision between Senate Republican forces led by Senators Millikin and Robert A. Taft of Ohio on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other . Compromise Beaten , 46 to 29 The compromise lost , 46 to 29 , with seven Republican Senators deserting the Taft leadership to vote with Mr. Bridges , who is chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee . Six Republican Senators , including Messrs . Taft and Millikin , voted for the compromise . The action was not generally considered a clear-cut test of the leadership of Mr. Taft , however , as some Republicans were reprer sented as being surprised when he arose to oppose any cut of more than $5,000,000,000 . It was con // jectured that he did not throw the full force of his influence as the acknowledged leader of the Senate behind the compromise proposal . On the final tally , House and Senate Republicans voted almost solidly for the $6,000,000,000 cut . Senators Chan Gurney of South Dakota , chairman of the Armed Services Committee , William F. Knowland of California , Guy Cordon of Oregon , and Milton R. Young of North Dakota were alone among Republicans holding out to the end against a reduction of that amount . Seven Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut . They were Senators Harry F. Byrd of Virginia , Walter F. George of Georgia , Edwin C. Johnson of Colorado and K. D. of Tennessee and Representatives Robert L. Doughton of North Carolina , John H. Kerr of North Carolina and Wilbur D. Mills of Arkansas . On Mr. Millikin 's compromise proposal , the Republican Senators who joined him and Mr. Taft were Joseph H. Ball of Minnesota , Owen Brewster of Maine , Gurney and Young . Republican Senators voting with Mr. Bridges were C. Wayland Brooks of Illinois , Harlan J. Bushfield of Sout1 Dakota , Hugh Butler of Nebraska , Homer Ferguson of Michigan , Albert W. Ha'vkes of New Jersey , Edward Martin of Pennsylvania and Kenneth S. Wherry of Nebraska . The only Democrats to vote against the compromise were Senators Byrd , Johnson and and Representatives Doughton , and George H. Mahon of Texas . Mr. Mahon opposed any reduction whatever in the President 's budget , while the others favored more than a $4,500,000,000 cut . The Millikin move failed despite its support by members interested in averting drastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities of the . Government- as well as those seeking to preserve what they considered to be adequate funds for the armed services . Mr. Millikin told reporters he was mainly interested in guaran ? ? teeing sufficient funds for the armed forces but was also seeking to avert possible overcutting of public works projects . Barkley Motion Beaten Opponents of any reduction at all in the President 's budget , who subsequently joined forces with those favoring less drastic a cut . than that finally approved , started their offensive as soon as Representative John Taber of New York , chairman , banged his gavel for order . Senator Alben W. Barkley , of Kentucky , minority leader , moved to open the meeting to the public and the press . He was voted down , 42 to 27 , but throughout the day Democratic members popped out of the committee room in relays to keep reporters informed of any important proposal or decision . A motion by Senator Gurney to limit the proposed budget cut to $4,150,000,000 then was defeated , 46 to 29 . After that came the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that its cause was lost , the battle continued throughout the afternoon . First Mr. Barkley was ruled out of order by Mr. Taber on a motion to stipulate that any Congressional action on tax reduction be deferred until after the House had passed all appropriation bills . The chair was sustained , 49 to 26 . Other Moves Rejected Senator Knowland was defeated , 39 to 34 , on a motion to stipulate that at least $3,000,000,000 of the contemplated savings be applied to reduction of the public debt . An effort by Senator Theodore F. Green , Democrat , of Rhode Island , to apply all of the savings to debt reduction was voted down , 40 to 32 . A motion by Representative John D. Dingell , Democrat , of Michigan , to prohibit any reductions in the President 's requests for the armed services and veterans was rejected by a voice vote . After the decisive vote for a $6,000,000,000 cut Democratic hecklers won a moral if somewhat empty victory upon unanimous adoption of a motion by Repre. sentative Mine J. Forand of Rhode Island to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During the committee 's luncheon recess Senator Gurney took his case to the Senate floor with a speech against disarmament " until the United Nations is a going concern and until it has power to compel acceptance of its decisions . " Senators Joseph C. O'Mahoney , Democrat of Wyoming , and Wayne Morse , Republican of Oregon , also voiced protest on the Senate floor . Mr. O'Mahoney termed the committee 's action " a flash in the dark to deceive the people . " He told reporters the whole debate before the committee " shows there was no study and is no understanding " among those proposing the $6,000 , - 000,000 cut . The resolution approved by the committee , as it will be submitted to the House and Senate , probably next Wednesday , specifically leaves an opening for Congress to go over the $31,500,000,000 ceiling in passing individual appropriation bills . The committee report states : . " The resolution expressed an over-all objective and its realization depends entirely upon the final action of the Congress upon budget estimates , individually and collectively . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be apportioned among various Government departments and agencies . Republican leaders refused , on demands of Democrats in the meeting , to say just where the reductions would be made .
