In the tough , highly competitive oil industry , James Andrew Moffett , 60 , is a man who can take care of himself in the clinches . And he likes a grudge fight . A onetime senior vice president of Standard Oil ( N.J. ) , later board chairman of the Bahrein Petroleum Co. , Ltd. , Moffett stirred up such a fight last January . <P> Sharp-tempered Jimmy Moffett filed suit for $6,000,000 against Arabian American Oil Co. ( owned by Standard Oil Co. of California and the Texas Co. , which also own Bahrein Petroleum ) , holder of the vast oil concessions in Saudi Arabia ( TIME , March 24 ) . This sum , said he , was due him for political chores done while he was with Bahrein Petroleum . When a Senate committee perked up its ears at this charge , Jimmy Moffett gladly told his story . <P> In 1941 , he said , King Ibn Saud demanded from Arabian American Oil ( Aramco ) $6,000,000 a year for five years because his oil royalties had fallen off . Aramco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem to President Roosevelt , under whom he had served as the New Deal 's first housing administrator . Moffett suggested that the U.S. give Ibn Saud the $6,000,000 for five years . Aramco would pay it off by delivery of oil to the U.S. Navy . The deal fell through . But soon after , said Moffett ( and a letter from Jesse Jones , then Federal Loan chief , seemed to back him up ) , Ibn Saud got his money from the British , who had been asked to pass it along to the King out of funds they were receiving from the U.S. <P> When the Navy did buy Aramco oil during the latter part of the war , Moffett said , his onetime associates doubled the prices he had quoted President Roosevelt , " deliberately defrauded " the Government out of some $33,000,000 . ( The Navy promptly denied this , said it had paid less for Persian Gulf Oil than for oil from other sources . ) <P> In revealing this tale of international oil intrigue and secret diplomacy , Moffett had left out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Starling Sullivan Rodgers , Aramco director and board chairman of the Texas Co . First , he called Moffett 's accusations of overcharging the Navy " absolutely false . " Then Rodgers threw a Sunday punch . Moffett , he implied , was firing off his charges because he was trying to get control of Arabian oil himself . A year ago , Moffett had tried to persuade Ibn Saud to cancel Aramco 's concession , give it to Moffett &; friends . If Ibn Saud did , Moffett promised to double his royalties . <P> To this Jimmy Moffett answered , in effect-so what ? He had tried to make a deal with Ibn Saud . But this action , he said , was entirely within his rights . <P> Whether by accident or not , Moffett had picked a shrewd time to air his charges . For any investigation of Arabian oil in the immediate future would be against the background of U.S. diplomacy in the Middle East . To take a hard look at this smeary oil picture , the Senate committee has called in former Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skilled scandal snuffer who first won national attention while investigating Teapot Dome . Wheeler has not yet decided whether a fulldress investigation is warranted . But last week all signs pointed to one .
