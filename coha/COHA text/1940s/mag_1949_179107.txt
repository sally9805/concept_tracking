Shanghai , which had known little quiet in its turbulent history , fell to the Communists one sunny morning last week- quietly . <P> Three days earlier , Shanghai 's Nationalist defenders had announced : " We will fight to the last drop of blood . " Most Shanghailanders fervently hoped that this promise would not be kept . They regarded the Nationalist cause as hopeless , and feared that a prolonged defense would bring nothing but pillage and destruction to the world 's fourth largest city ( pop . 6,000,000 ) . <P> Run , Fight , Push . While a Nationalist spokesman was shouting words of defiance , something else was happening around Shanghai 's defense perimeter . From his vantage point on the twelfth floor of the massive Picardie Apartments in Shanghai 's old French concession , an American looked south over Lunghua airport . Later he described what he saw : " There were sharp bursts of machine-gun fire from the south . Then , within minutes , every road into the city was clogged with retreating Nationalist soldiers and civilians . Soldiers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The soldiers ran and fought and pushed . " <P> By midmorning of the following day the Nationalists were in full retreat , plunging northward through Shanghai 's jammed and clamorous heart . Some outfits marched through almost in parade formation ; others , caked with mud from the battlefields , streaked through the city in terror and confusion , taking with them everything they could lift , carry or roll . <P> Top Nationalist officials made an eleventh-hour getaway from Kiangwan airfield . One of them was Mayor Chen Liang , who had just announced the beginning of " Health Week " in Shanghai . Quipped the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury the next day , before the Communists took it over : " The mayor certainly was sincere about it . He found out what seemed best for his health and promptly did it . " By dusk , the western and southern outskirts of the city were bare of troops . <P> What Day Is It ? At midnight , Communist infantrymen commanded by General Chen Yi began filtering into Shanghai through the French concession in the southwest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In small groups they advanced slowly down the sidewalks of Avenue Joffre and Great Western Road , sidling close to buildings for protection against occasional fire from isolated Nationalist snipers . By 9 a.m. they had reached the city 's skyscraper-lined Bund . <P> The Reds ' light , mustard-colored uniforms were generally clean , and the men were well armed with Bren guns , Tommy guns , modern rifles ( some of Japanese make , some U.S. ) . They carried pouches of hand grenades at their belts , bandoleers of cartridges across their shoulders . Many were exhausted . At every halt , soldiers slumped in doorways and on sidewalks . One tall native of Shantung looked up wearily : " What day is it today ? We 've been walking and fighting for eight days . "
