Charles L. Wagner is a U. S. impresario who looks like Jim Farley in a toupee and who long ago exchanged his flat Illinois drawl for rapid-fire Manhattanese . Fifty years ago he gave up collecting celebrities ' autographs , began collecting them on contracts instead . Since then Impresario Wagner has barnstormed up &; down the U. S. selling such big-time figures as William Jennings Bryan , John McCormack , Galli-Curci . Mary Garden , Walter Gieseking to the public . <P> Last year , when inconvenient railroad schedules in New England and the South annoyed him no end , Barnstormer Wagner got a new idea for barnstorming tours . He decided to take opera to smaller U. S. cities by the busload . Picking Rossini 's oldtime Barber of Seville as the most portable opera ( two scenic sets , chorus optional ) that he could think of , he chartered a big , shiny Greyhound-type bus , remodeled its roof to accommodate a ten-foot pile of scenery , and started signing up a busworthy crew of singers from Manhattan 's Metropolitan Opera . He called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Last week , complete with ten singers , a conductor and assistant , two rehearsal pianists , a stage director and a driver , Impresario Wagner 's operatic bus fumed out of Manhattan on the first lap of a 5,000-mile run which will take it as far south as Birmingham , Ala. , as far north as Pittsfield , Mass . By Friday , when it hit the Lafayette College gymnasium at Easton , Pa. , Metropolitan Singers Hilde Reggiani , Armand Tokatyan and John Gurney were complaining of the Cuban cigars smoked by fat Conductor Giuseppe Bamboschek in the back seat . But the 550-odd college students who jammed Easton 's gymnasium thought the bus-toted Barber was swell , spent ten minutes bellowing and pounding for curtain calls . When it was over , huge Driver Tim Ward loaded his flats and backdrops with an eye to low bridges , trundled his busload of opera on to Huntington , W. Va .
