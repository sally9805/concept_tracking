The only fully motorized U.S. infantry , one of the nine triangular ( three instead of four infantry regiments ) divisions in the Army , last week was chosen for an experiment : to try out the newest 1942 pattern for triangular divisions . Fort Benning 's Fourth , a streamlined outfit commanded by spring-legged Major General Lloyd R. Fredendall , is a weld of oldtimers , new regulars and more than 5,000 draftees . For its experiment , the Fourth is to get 50% more fire power , the first tanks to be assigned as part of an infantry unit , and the first of the Army 's new self-propelled artillery . <P> To give the Fourth bigger fists and nimbler feet , while its fire power will be upped its man power will be cut-from 15,550 to 14,000 . Machine-gun equipment will go up from 282 to 465 , cannon ( 75s , 105s and 155s ) from 48 to 66 . Ten armored scout cars will be added to the 16 now in the reconnaissance troop . Fifty-two light and 54 medium tanks will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who will ride to battle in halftrack caterpillar troop carriers . <P> The Fourth is now almost fully equipped by 1941 standards ( chiefly lacks 105-mm. howitzers ) . Well up to snuff on the new wrinkles in high-speed modern warfare ( which it demonstrates regularly to officer-students at Fort Benning 's Infantry School ) it expects to get most of its additional equipment in a hurry , in time to show its new punch in the First Army maneuvers , next November , in the Carolinas.
