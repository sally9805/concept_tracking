Myron Charles Taylor is 67 years old and has been in delicate health since an operation for gallstones 15 months ago . Only a matter of supreme importance would have taken President Roosevelt 's personal envoy back to his post at the Vatican last week . Such a matter , beyond doubt , was the message Envoy Taylor bore from his President to Pope Pius XII . <P> Myron Taylor alighted at Rome 's airport late one afternoon , weary from a Clipper flight across the Atlantic , a long conference with Ambassador to France Admiral William Daniel Leahy in Barcelona , another exhausting flight to Rome . <P> He went early to bed . Next morning he was up betimes and off to the Vatican for a conference of nearly two hours with Papal Secretary of State Luigi Cardinal Maglione . That afternoon he spent an hour and ten minutes with the Pope . <P> To reporters who wanted to know what his message was , Envoy Taylor had only one answer : " I am the message . " Not a word leaked out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were forbidden even to mention Myron Taylor 's name-a prohibition that was soon violated by fire-eating Editor Roberto Farinacci of Regime Fascista , who heatedly hissed that Envoy Taylor had come to get the Pope 's approval of President Roosevelt 's war aims . <P> That may have been so , but peace aims would have been a better guess . The Roosevelt-Churchill eight-point program , issued after their meeting last month , was strikingly similar in essential philosophy to the five " precepts for the conclusion of a lasting and just peace , " which Pope Pius broadcast last Christmas Eve . In only one important point did the two programs differ : the Pope failed to condemn " Nazi tyranny . " <P> That the Pope would take a strong stand against Nazi Germany , while refusing to take a stand against Godless Communist Russia , was perhaps too much to expect . But if the President , as spokesman for the world 's democracies , and the Pope , as spokesman for the world 's Catholics , could agree on one program of peace aims , then each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. and Latin America , but in France , Spain , Portugal , and even in Italy and Germany , Catholics would be influenced . As for Russia , she could do little but subscribe to the program . <P> The Pope 's mind was on peace . This week he issued a solemn call to prayer for peace during October . Said Osservatore Romano , organ of the Vatican : " May this solemn supplication asked by the Pope serve to hasten the prophetic day when all humanity . . . will find again . . . true prosperity of both individuals and nations .
