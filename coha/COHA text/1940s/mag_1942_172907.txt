For a while it was exciting to be a cause celebre . When pretty , honey-haired Teacher Isabelle Hallin was fired because of gossip that she had served cocktails to her high-school students ( TIME , July 19 , 1937 ) , her neighbors in Saugus , Mass. signed petitions ; students picketed her detractors ' homes . She saw her picture splashed over the nation 's front pages . Columnists glorified her . Out of the notoriety came a screen test-a chance to escape the humdrum life of a schoolmarm . <P> That was in 1937 . She flunked the screen test . A radio job in Boston petered out . She sang a few times in nightclubs . Then she was forgotten . But there was no going back to Saugus . She wound up in Manhattan , writing advertising copy for lingerie and haberdashery , living in a tiny Greenwich Village apartment , struggling to make ends meet , like thousands of other obscure working girls . <P> On Christmas Eve life looked like an enemy to Isabelle Hallin . She was 32 , lonesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in seven months . She had failed to get a year's-end raise . She wrote a bitter note to her boss ; then , early on Christmas morning , she turned on the hissing gas jets . Once more Isabelle Hallin got her name in the newspapers .
