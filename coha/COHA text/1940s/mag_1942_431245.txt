 | Rubber conservation means that you will use your automobile only for necessary trips , not for riding . And the baby will be left at home . So taking the baby outdoors must become a scheduled part of the day 's routine . Unless you have a yard or porch , a baby carriage will be a necessity . Before you buy one , look over the various types and select one that comes within your budget . You have a wide choice ? from elaborate perambulators to folding canvas carriages . You can keep the latter from sagging by putting a flat , hard pillow or pad under the baby . Remember that he must have room to sleep in comfort . An area 32 " x 14 " is sufficient . Springs should be firm , so the baby will not bounce too much . The carriage should be easy for you to push and strong enough to stand being tilted for curbs . A good brake is essential . Put on the brake whenever you stop , so the carriage wo n't roll when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always keep your hands on the bar . Accidents have happened because mothers or nurses have pushed the carriage casually ahead of them and then failed to reach it in time to avoid a mishap . if the carriage has a hood , be sure it 's rain resistant , lined with a dark , restful material . If it has n't , carry a square of rubberized cloth or oilcloth , which , with a folded newspaper at the head , can be used for protection if you 're caught in a sudden downpour . If the child sleeps outdoors in the summer , keep a layer of mosquito netting over his crib or carriage . Dress the baby according to the weather . When it 's cold , put extra clothing on him for his airing ? a sweater and cap or a shawl and hood . Then wrap him loosely in blankets or shawls . He should be able to move his arms and legs and roll over without a struggle . To keep his toes free , place a small bolster or tight roll of newspaper higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriage , and tuck the blankets over it . If it is so warm the baby is wearing only one garment , carry additional clothing in case the weather changes . When his body is well covered . the sun may shine directly on him ; but he should not face the direct rays of the sun or reflected light or glare . Watch out for pinking of his skin , and turn the carriage so that his body will be in slight shadow and his delicate skin will not sunburn . Watch out for windburn , too . Do n't get into the habit of wheeling the carriage until the baby falls asleep , or rocking it to quiet him . Use the carriage to take him to a convenient place for his airing , and then let him remain there quietly . Accustom the baby to sleeping in his carriage while it is still or to remain there happily if he is awake . If he has never been wheeled to sleep , he will not demand it . As the child grows older , he will wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sliding board toward the foot end so that the youngster can sit comfortably . If your carriage does n't , you may need a gocart or stroller . As soon as the child can pull himself to a sitting position , buy a safety strap , and always fasten it . As a toddler tires easily on city streets , it is better to wheel him to and from the park . Then he wo n't be exhausted when he gets home . For mothers with porches or yards , the problem is much simpler . The baby can spend as much time as possible outdoors in a crib or carriage . A healthy baby born in the spring can have indoor airings after he is a few weeks old and usually can be taken outdoors by the end of the fifth or sixth week . In summer outdoor airings can be started before he 's that old . For the first airing , choose a dry , sunny day and keep the baby outdoors for about twenty minutes . The time can be increased each day until the baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one or two in the afternoon . In the spring and fall choose the sunniest hours . In cool weather it is best to wait for threequarters to one hour after the baby 's bath before taking him outdoors . In summer try to avoid the burning heat of the day ; but if your rooms are hot and if he is more comfortable outdoors , keep him out as long as you can .
