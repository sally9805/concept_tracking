txt ALBANY , April ** Assembly today passed and sent to the Governor a drastic measure , aimed directly at the Transport Workers Union in New York City , to prevent future strikes on either privately or publicly owned bus , trolley or subway lines . The measure was occasioned by the recent bus strike and the threat of a strike on the city subway lines which the union is now making . The bill , sponsored by Senator Arthur H. Wicks , chairman of the Senate Committee on Public Service , was introduced quietly last Thursday , passed the Senate , and went through the Assembly today without a dissenting Vote . The bill amends the old railroad sabotage statute , to include bus , trolley and subway lines , and includes in the list of punishable offenses the leaving " unattended any car , bus or other transit facility of equipment given into his possession or care as an officer ; employe or agent of any such privately or publicly owned or operated railroad , street railroad or bus system . " The Wicks measure leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusually severe . They make any of the offenses listed punishable by a prison term of up to five years in any event and up to twenty years ' imprisonment if the safety of any person is endangered by the act of sabotage committed . Thus , these would be the penalties for a walkout on the subway system under the Wicks bill . The other offenses covered in the statute include placing obstructions on the tracks , destroying guards or danger signals , throwing stones or other missiles , shutting off or injuring motive power . These would apply to the Transport Workers Union on the bus , trolley or subway lines . While the bill went through quietly , most of the members of the Legislature knew what they were voting on and did it as a rebuke to the // ASSEMBLY PASSES ANTI-STRIKE BILL // union . The City Administration knew of the measur , and interposed no objection , although whether it had given formal approval was not ascertained . A delegation from the union called on Senator Wicks several days ago to voice its objections , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sponsor two years ago of the bill which put all of the employes of the IRT and BMT systems under civil service , along with the employes of the Independent system , whenever unification became effective . The union leaders fought that bill at the time , since the civil service status gave the men rights which might result in the stopping the paying of union dues , since they could get more as civil service employes than as union members . A number of members did stop payment of dues . As a result their homes have been picketed by other union members . The issue is coming to a head soon because the collective bargaining agreement which the union signed with the city is to expire within a few months , and the union wants a renewal of it . The city is opposed to any such renewal , from all indications . At the recent Atlantic City convention of the union , 4100,000 was voted to the New York local as a fund to carry on its battle .

I. 0 . affiliate , disclosed yesterday . The new minimum applies only to agents with five years or less of service . The former rates for this group of agents , most of them women , ranged from 36 to 50 cents . According to union officials about 850 other BMT agents are still clamoring for the same top rate as that in force on the IRT division , where the top rate is 65.2 cents , as compared with 54 cents on the BMT . All station agents are now classified as railroad clerks . Despite the rises just granted , the union indicated , pressure will still be exerted to brim the BMT rates to the IRT level in all respects . One of the matters that the union seeks to discuss with Mayor La Guardia and the Board of Transportation is the payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the BMT as are paid for like work to the men on the IRT division Last November the Board of Transportation raised the top rate of clerks on the IND division of the city system to the IRT level . Up to that time station agents on the IND division received 62.5 cents an hour .
