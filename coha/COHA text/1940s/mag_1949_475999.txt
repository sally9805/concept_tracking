THE first two weeks that I was in Moscow in 1947 , when my husband was working at the American Embassy , I was never without a guide . It was my own doing ; I made the mistake of thinking I could see more of the city on a supervised tour than I could by myself . An owl-eyed youth who spoke English with the painful correctness of an Eton schoolmaster shepherded me diligently through endless museums , art galleries , and Parks of Culture and Rest . ' Whenever I suggested that we look at something a little more alive , he merely bobbed his shaved head and continued blandly on , down one drafty corridor after another . At last , one gray March day , he was sick ; and , with my American passport pinned to my inside pocket , I set out on a solitary tour of inspection . After walking a mile along the river , I came to a section of the city I had never seen ? row after row of drab wooden buildings . In the driving spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs , it was hard to make out the addresses . Yet I knew that People 's Court Number Twelve must be in this block . My feet were soaked and my skirt , too . Any other time I would have turned back , but my first day alone , nothing was going to stop me . Standing in the downpour , I at last saw the number twelve scrawled on a building which looked more like a warehouse than a court . I climbed the steps and faced a blank wooden door with no bell and no knocker . I banged two or three times , then turned the knob and went in . I FOUND myself in a long , narrow hall , with doors opening off to the right and left . From a window high above , a single square of light fell across the dark , oiled floor . Men and women with brief cases were clustered about in groups , talking in low tones . None of them paid any attention to me . I tried one of the doors along the hall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I pushed against it . I slipped inside a room that looked like a small classroom , packed with people . They were all standing up , so that it was hard to see . In time I caught a glimpse of the judge , a worried-looking young woman who sat behind a bare , wooden table , with an assistant on either side . The defendant stood before them . He was a big , raw-boned fellow with black , mussed hair and a scar down the side of his face . He wore a soiled uniform , without insignia , and as he talked he twisted his cap in his red-knuckled hands . From where I stood it was impossible to hear what he said . All at once I noticed an empty bench in the front of the room and started worming my way forward . The people gave way without protest . With a sigh of relief I seated myself and slipped off my coat . The defense lawyer , who was sitting only a few feet away , looked up from his papers with a start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his unmistakable blue uniform glared at me . I saw him take a step toward me , but the crowd held him back . My first impulse was to get up and slink away . On second thought I took out a pad and a pencil and began jotting down notes . The policeman screwed up his round moon face in perplexity , then relaxed against the wall . I could only hope that my hoax had worked ? that he actually thought I was one of the many officials sent by the Soviets to check up on court procedure . As I listened to the case , I pieced together a little of what was going on , although , with my merely workaday knowledge of Russian , legal phraseology was beyond me . One thing was obvious ? the people on trial were involved in some kind of illegal money-making . The raw-boned peasant in front of the judges was making his final plea , in labored , ungrammatical Russian . He explained that he had once been a policeman and that he had always supported " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cry . Between sobs , he promised that he would never do it again , that he had only committed this offense because times were hard and he had to live somehow . When he had finished , his wife , a lean , sharp-faced woman , rose to speak . She wore a matted orange sweater , and a long maroon-colored skirt with a torn pocket . She started in a loud , defiant voice , but she did n't get far before she , too , started to snivel . Over and over she spoke of their daughter , of what would become of her , their little girl , if they were sent away to a prison camp . All during this speech a huge , blousy young woman , at least eighteen years old , on the bench opposite me , was gulping and loudly wiping her nose on her sleeve . She , it turned out , was the " little girl . " When the mother sat down , there was a few minutes ' intermission while the judge read over the evidence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move for fear of rousing the policeman to action . However , he was lounging against the wall and seemed to have forgotten about me . TILL I was uneasy . Ever since taking my place on the bench , I had been aware of someone standing in back of me and edging up closer and closer , until I could feel warm , even breathing against my neck . I turned slightly , enough to catch sight of a buxom girl of sixteen or seventeen in a black headscarf , gazing at me avidly . I pretended to pay no attention until she began rubbing the collar of my green gabardine suit around and around in her fingers . When I looked at her again , she took her hand away , and a deep flush stole over her broad , youthful face . " I ? I 'm sorry , " she stammered . " In Moscow such material is very strange ? and very beautiful . Where I work , down on Arbat Square ? I 'm a seamstress , you see ? my friends will never believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so strong ! " Again she was touching my suit . As she caught my eye , she pulled her hand hack , and gazed in great embarrassment at her frayed cloth shoes . I assured her I did n't mind and invited her to sit down . Her small blue eyes blinked at me in astonishment . " Me sit there ? I could n't ! That bench is reserved for high government officials . " " Oh ? oh , of course . " I smiled . " You 're not Russian , are you ? " " No , American . " " I see . Then , naturally , you have permission to sit there . " She was silent for a minute before she asked , " What is your name ? " I told her . " Oh . " She tried to pronounce it . " Mine 's Galya Petrovna Sergievna . Tell me , are your courts in America like this ? I 've heard you have one set of courts for the rich and another for the poor . In Russia everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assured her it was the same in America . Then , because I had missed some of the trial , I asked her to explain what had been going on . Her broad , freckled face broke into smiles . With great formality she answered , " For me it would be a pleasure . To tell the truth , I have never before spoken to an American . Your people come so seldom to visit us that we Russians think you have no interest in our way of life . Your big newspapers are run by monopolists and they tell your citizens that we live like beasts in the field . Is that not so ? " Again I tried to set her right , but there was only a moment till the court convened . So , putting aside our political discussion , we talked about the trial . " The man and his wife are speculators . They have broken the law . " She pronounced her words slowly as one does to a child who is mastering his first vocabulary . The defendants had been paying thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in Kiev , where factories were scarce , for one hundred and eighty rubles . With the money they made , they bought food in the south where it was cheap , and resold it back in Moscow for a comfortable profit . I wanted to know what they were selling in Kiev . " Jenskie podshtaniki , " Galya said . It meant nothing to me . " Can you describe it ? " I asked . She gave me a strange look , then put a stubby finger to her Lips . Visions of opium and marijuana flashed through my mind , but I held my tongue : the court was in session . Galya planted herself behind me again , feet spread wide apart , arms akimbo . A heavy look of concentration clouded her face ; even the judge could not have paid closer attention . The lawyer for the defense rose to give one last plea . The accused were not bad people , he said , as the man 's army record clearly showed . " Well , if they were so good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they cheat the poor people in Moscow , and make them pay prices they could n't afford ? " The temptation before them had been great and they needed money , the plump , white-faced lawyer continued . He spoke in a sing-song tone which made me doubt if his heart was really in this particular case . " Times have been hard for all of us , " muttered the voice in back of me . " If two grown people like them have trouble earning a living , how does he suppose it is for us young ones when our parents are dead . Still we do n't break the lawl " T HE case was over now . All that remained was for the court to pronounce the verdict . For ten minutes , the young judge conferred with her two helpers behind the scarred , wooden desk . And as she listened to their counseling , she endlessly locked and interlocked her long , delicate fingers . I could see that she was tired . Once as she leaned back against the chair , her eyelids drooped shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had pulled herself up and was busily thumbing through a law book for some obscure paint . Behind me , the crowd shifted and stamped like a giant restless horse moving about in its stall . Then as the judge began reading the sentence they grew tense and silent . The man was given seven years in the work camp , his wife five . As soon as the judge had given her decision , the daughter , " the little girl , " gave a loud yell and , clapping her hands to her ears , bolted down the aisle and out the door . The room was alive with loud exclamations and excited argument . Through the din I could hear Galya trying to say something . I turned around and faced her . " Do you think the verdict was fair ? " She laughed . " That 's what I was going to ask you . " Then she grew serious ; her forehead was strained into a series of little puckers above the flat bridge of her nose . After a moment 's thought , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoulders , and I saw that her straw-blonde hair was tied back with bits of string in two neat pigtails . " Yes , it was fair . They did n't deserve a lighter sentence ? robbing people like that . Still I ca n't help thinking what it means for them . The husband and wife will be separated , you know . And life in the prison camps is n't easy ? working out in the fields the way they have to , in all kinds of weather . Or maybe down in the mines where it 's always cold and damp . Oh , I do n't mean a healthy person ca n't stand it . But did you notice that woman ? She was so thin and her face had a sort of ' yellow look to it . If you ask me , there 's a good chance she wo n't come back ! Oh , I 'll bet they 'd neither of them break the law again , if they had it to do over ! " By now the court was fairly empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it was legal for us both to occupy . As we waited for the next trial , I asked again what item it was the family had been buying up in Moscow . Quickly my friend glanced around . No one was watching . Moving close to me , she began sliding her wrinkled black skirt up over her knee . Suddenly I saw them ? her panties ! They were blue cotton-jersey affairs , standard all over Russia . It was for this the speculators had risked their lives and the women of Kiev had paid one hundred and eighty rubles. 1 OKING at Galya with her scrubbed com-plexion and childish eyes , I wondered why she came to the courts . She was not an embittered old woman , a misanthropic graybeard , or a hard-worked housewife , but a young girl ? the age which never makes up the audience at a trial in the United States , except when a Flynn or Mitchum go to court . " Do you come here very often ? " I asked . " Oh yes , at least twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why ? Because it 's fun and it does n't cost anything , like the movies . Our room is just around the corner . So when there 's a good case on , I make a point of getting my brothers fed and the dishes washed up early . You see , the courts stay open till ten every night . " " Does n't your family worry , when you 're out after dark ? " " Who is there to worry ? There 's just my two brothers ? Nikolai and Sergei , and they do n't care . They 're a lot younger than I am . Papa and Mamenka died in the war . " " How do you live then , if there 's just the three of you children ? " " I 'm no child ! " She was annoyed . " Maybe I look young or something , but I 'm seventeen . Down at the shop I 've got more seniority than most of the women . I had my first job when I was fourteen . That 's when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? in battle , I mean . His scouting party was marooned up north , near Leningrad , and he froze to death . A month later , Mamenka caught pneumonia ? lots of people had it then ; we burned our furniture trying to keep her warm , but she died , too . " " What happened after that ? Do your relatives help you , or the government ? " She cast a queer look in my direction . " You Americans think it 's all so easy . You would n't understand if I told you that I had nineteen relatives ? uncles , aunts , and cousins . After the war three were left alive , and only one of them ? a boy younger than me ? is well enough to work . Whenever it can , the government helps , and it would help us , I sup-pose . Only why should I go begging , as long as I can work ? Others need it more . " I shook my head . " I could n't have done so much when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard . She flushed . " Oh , it 's not so bad . Especially when everyone you know is up against the same thing . " She sighed heavily . " It is n't the eight hours sewing at the shop I mind . To tell the truth , though , marketing every day , and cooking and cleaning up after the boys is a full-time job in itself . It always kept Mamenka busy . In winter it 's hardest of all , when you have to splash from one market-place to another , picking up a carrot here and a hit of cabbage or a few onions there . Some weeks I just ca n't make it down to the court . And always , if I want to come , I have to plan every minute . Still , I think a person has to have a little relaxation , do n't you ? " Her blue eyes were sober as she waited for my answer . It was a minute before I understood that she really wanted my opinion ? that she felt coming to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I agreed , she was happy again . " I 'm glad to hear you say that . Having to make all the decisions for a family the way I do , it 's hard sometimes to know if you 're right or not . " BILE I sat there beside Galya , watching the room fill up for the next trial , I thought of all the museums and art exhibits I had seen in the past few weeks . Had I spent a year in those damp galleries , I should not have caught the spirit of Soviet life one tenth as well as here in Court Number Twelve in a single afternoon . The judge and her two assistants came in and sat down behind the table . Court was in session once more . A woman who was responsible for delivering one-hundred-pound sacks of flour from the mill to the bakeries was charged with negligence . During the icy winter she had chosen to ride in the cab with the driver , rather than in the back of the truck where she could keep a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two sacks were found to be light by twenty pounds apiece . As the case got under way , men and women jammed back into the small unventilated room . Looking at them , I wondered if the courts might not solve the entertainment problem for more people than Galya alone . Certainly the ballet and legitimate stage are far beyond the means of the ordinary Muscovite . Even the movies are expensive , and besides a person can never be sure of a ticket . Every night , long lines start forming in front of the theaters hours before the first show . And inevitably large crowds are turned away . The courts are different ? if he is willing to stand , anyone can get in . Yet was it as simple as that ? Exactly why , I kept asking myself , should this gray , indeterminate crowd come to a stuffy courtroom to spend its few spare hours ? The libraries and the Parks of Culture and Rest were free , and there was always Gorki Street ? the " great white way " ? or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could wander . In the corner stood a blunt-nosed peasant . He was self-conscious about his hands , which were stained black from engine grease . Twice he pulled out a crumpled khaki handkerchief and tried to scrub them clean . Perhaps he was a laborer at the Stalin Auto Works , or a maintenance man on Moscow 's famous subway . In any event , he followed the trials with great concentration . Only when the judge handed down a decision , did he allow himself the luxury of nudging the person next to him and smacking his lips as if to say , " Now that 's a girl who knows her business ! " I decided there must be others in the room like him ? simple people , still newly come into a sense of their own power , who had a feeling as they stood crowded together of watching the government , their government , working on a small , personal plane they could understand . " There 's Miss Efremova ! She teaches Russian language and literature at my old school . " Galya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose I ought to speak to her , but she scares me . " I glanced across the aisle . My first impression was of a big , weary eagle . A tall woman , probably six feet , with an enormous hook nose , sat hunched on the bench , following every word of the trial with little twitches of her head . Stacked beside Miss Efremova were three books . Galya craned her neck to read the titles : " Gogol 's Dead Souls , Chekov 's Cherry Orchard , and somebody 's Collected Poems ? probably Lermontov 's . He 's her favorite . Even in the seventh grade , she was always MAGAZINE talking about the ' Russian Soul , ' and if we did n't know all about those old authors , she 'd get mad and say we were ignorant ? that we had no business sitting in school and wasting the state 's money . Nobody made us study the way she did ? three or four hours a night reading those old-fashioned things . They were hard , they made me cry ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred to me that Galya 's statement and the intent look on Miss Efremova 's face might be a clue to another reason for the court 's popularity ? the most fundamental reason of all . I had often heard of the traditionally tragic Russian temperament and its morbid preoccupations . Certainly Russian art and Russian literature ? stark and bitter and dramatic as they are ? do not differ much , except in aesthetic quality , from the realism of these courts . I N THE second case , the defendant said very little in her own behalf . Instead her lawyer pleaded for her at length in a quiet , ingratiating voice . ' Whenever he spoke her wide black eyes followed him intently , and her silent lips moved , mouthing his words . Then as the government lawyer rose to speak against her , she shrank into herself . With bowed shoulders and vacant eyes , she stared at the knotty , calloused hands hanging loose between her knees . She was not an old woman ; thirty-six was the age she had stated . Yet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close around her , she looked like the embodiment of hopeless old age . " What will happen ? " I prodded Galya . She jumped . " I ca n't tell . " Her voice was irritable . " I 've never seen a case just Like this . She could get as much as ten years in the work camp . It does n't seem fair though . She did n't steal the flour herself . I 'm sure of that . " The judge spoke sharply to the woman who answered in a slow , defeated voice . Just then the door burst open and in waddled a witness . At least as wide as he was tall , the man was a perfect stand-in for W. C. Fields . With one forefinger raised in front of his red bulbous nose he kept trying to explain that he was the flour-mill inspector ; only the words tumbled out backward . The big government lawyer tapped on his chair nervously . Then , jumping up , he faced the court . Although he himself had arranged for the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might as well be removed . At this the inspector turned of his own accord and , hiccuping softly , fumbled for the door . The lawyer 's angry voice boomed down the hall after him that he was a disgrace to Soviet officialdom for appearing in such condition . Glad of a little comic relief , the audience snickered , but soon fell silent as the case was resumed . When it came time to read the sentence , the judge pushed her legal papers aside . Lacing her thin white fingers together , she leaned forward and spoke directly to the defendant cringing in front of her . Such disregard for responsibility , she said , was actually a crime against the state , particularly these days when food was so short that the loss of a single kilo might mean starvation for some innocent person . The judge paused to let her words take effect . Then brushing a strand of black hair from her high , domed forehead , she continued . Although the court felt the woman had seriously neglected her duty , it did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to a work camp . However , her pay for the next six months would be cut in half . Such a penalty as that , light as it sounds , was not to be laughed at ; even with full pay , the ordinary Soviet citizen today earns only enough to keep alive . Yet the accused did not seem concerned . Even after the sentence was read , she continued to sit frozen in her seat with a glazed and happy look on her face . Finally the judge leaned forward and said in a low voice . " You can go now . You 're free . " Their eyes met for a second , then the woman sprang up as if released from a cage and rushed from the room . ALYA was obviously relieved at the outcome of the case . " You see , our courts are fair ! No matter how little or poor a person may be , he always has a chance to defend himself . I 've heard it 's not like that in America . " I explained that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is a rule in our courts to provide a lawyer for any person who can not afford to hire one himself . She nodded , yet did not seem convinced . " And I 've heard that the rich in your countrycan buy themselves free no matter what the crime , but the poor must always serve their sentence . And --  " I interrupted , " I 've been told similar things about Soviet justice , too ? that it is terribly severe , and for the least offence a man can be condemned to death or sent to prison camp for life . " " Oh no ! " Galya bristled with patriotism . " I have n't heard a sentence yet which I would n't be proud to hand down myself ! " " I did n't actually believe your government was so harsh , " I replied . " That 's why I wanted to see for myself . It 's hard to tell much about another country just from reading the papers . " Galya wrinkled her nose . " I never thought of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to America to find out what it was like , would n't I ? " It was nearing five o'clock and the slender judge looked haggard , yet another hearing was scheduled before the evening recess . Like the other two , this case had its beginning in the drive for food . The culprit was a girl of twenty-two , small for her age , with a thick wool scarf pulled close around her face . Five years before , while she was working at the Hotel National in Moscow , she had stolen a bread card and been sent to a work camp as punishment . Anyone sentenced to such a camp is automatically barred forever from returning to Moscow and the other big cities . H owEvER , a few days before the girl had disregarded the ban and come up to Moscow from a farm on the Volga where she had been living for the past year . Behind her she had left a four-year-old child . Coming in from the fields one night , she had skirted the day nursery where her daughter was being cared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moscow-bound ferry . Her reason for coming was to find an old beau who , she claimed , was the child 's father . He had been a comedian in one of the smaller theaters , but since the war she had heard nothing of him . No sooner did she arrive in the city than she was picked up for lack of a properly signed passport . Now she was terrified lest she be separated from her child and sent to another work camp . With one hand on the judge 's table to balance her , she poured out her story . However , her sobbing blurred the words so that no one could understand . One of the judge 's assistants , a tight-lipped old man who was busy trying to take notes , finally laid down his pen in defeat . I thought I saw a flicker of amusement cross the judge 's face as she looked at him . Then leaning across the table she spoke to the girl in a stern voice : " This sort of thing does n't help your case , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of time for that later on . " At this my young companion glanced at me apprehensively . We held our breath . Without leaving the room , the three officials behind the desk conferred . The accused continued to stand by the table , sniffling and biting her lip . As the judge turned to pronounce the sentence , her voice lost the severity of a magistrate and took on the warm , reassuring tone of a counsellor . This time there would be no penalty , for the court believed that the girl meant no real harm by coming to Moscow , but that she simply did not think the matter through . However , if such a thing happened again , the maximum punishment would be handed down , for it was time that the accused began considering her child and learning to face responsibility . " She 's a good judge . " Galya 's round face glowed with pleasure . " Are n't your judges all like that ? " " Not all . Oh , I do n't mean that every one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where this one has such a nice way about her . " I watched the youthful judge , pinning a strand of straight , black hair into the bun at the nape of her neck . I did not envy her the long , hot hours in court , the constant interruptions , and the weight of decision which in the end must rest with her alone . I T WAS dark when Galya and I left the court and started down the deserted street . A raw wind whipped the gray sheets of rain against our faces . Galya was oblivious to such small discomforts . Cheerfully she volunteered to walk with me to my streetcar , though her cheeks and nose were stung bright red from the icy rain . Coming up to the car tracks , she broke out laughing . " You 'd never guess the kind of game we play , a friend of mine and I , when we come to the courts . We have bets ? just a few rubles , you understand , but still it 's money ? on how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more exciting than today ? really serious crimes , and you ca n't tell how the verdict will go . I beat my friend Tanya a lot , and you should see her . She 's short , not as tall as you , but round and fat . And when I win , her face gets all pink and speckled and her little black eyes almost pop out , she 's so mad . Still , she 's a good sport . The end of the month , if I come out ahead , she always takes me to a real restaurant down by Revolutionary Square . And we have those tall glasses of tea and nice creamy eclairs . If I lose I take her ? though I really ca n't afford to . " All at once Galya looked abashed . She twisted her frayed black scarf in her red , work-scarred hands . " It 's really my only extravagance . And it 's the one thing I do n't tell the boys . Still , I should n't do it , should I ? " Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told her everyone had to decide these things for himself . Even after my run-down streetcar had rattled half a mile down the tracks I could see her standing there on the wet curbstone , mulling over the pros and cons of her secret sin . After all , I thought to myself , even in Moscow , seventeen is n't so very old .
