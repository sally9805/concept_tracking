Both have gone over &; over the same ground , disagreed , referred the dispute back to the Security Council , postponed meetings ; they suspended their debates after Gandhi 's death , resumed private discussions . Last week , for the first time , the Security Council heard from a native of harried Kashmir , one who had come 8,000 miles to make his speech . <P> He was black-eyed , 6 ft. 4 in . Sheik Mohamed Abdullah , Moslem head of the Kashmir Emergency Administration . Politely removing his caracul cap to address the Council , Abdullah insisted in quiet tones that Kashmir 's most urgent needs were peace and a democratic regime . <P> He was in no hurry for a plebiscite , especially one conducted ( as Pakistan demands ) by some " neutral " administration . In that land today , who could be neutral or impartial ? Abdullah struck a note of grave doubt : " I say to you frankly that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do not feel even He will act impartially . " <P> Next day in Kashmir , fighting between pro-Pakistan tribesmen and Kashmiri defense forces broke out again after a lull . In 48 hours , nearly 2,000 were killed .
