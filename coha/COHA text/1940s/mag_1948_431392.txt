- ar @#  | If you are an average middle-class American , there is a good chance that , before many seasons pass , you will be among the million tourists who , after a holiday in a foreign country , will approach their native land with varying degrees of relief , exhaustion , and nervousness . Perhaps you will arrive by ship . As your liner goes up New York harbor and is warped to its pier , the patriotic enthusiasm aroused by the Statue of Liberty may be tempered by the thought of another representative of the United States who awaits you . He is an inspector of the United States Bureau of Customs , and he is on hand to greet you personally , no matter where , when , or how you arrive . No one watches so constantly as he ; no one guards so many ports of entry . He awaits you at the dock ; he is there as you step from your plane ; he is your first American when you drive across the border ; he is in the train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is polite ; he is as thorough as he has time to be ; he is unavoidable . If you are fearful of your encounter with him , it may be because any official in uniform makes you nervous ; but more likely it is because you have in your luggage or on your person something you did n't mention on your Customs declaration , and hope to heaven he wo n't find . Wherever you can legally enter the United States . you will find the Customs men : at each of the 141 border stations through which automobiles pass : at every ship 's pier ; at every airport when a plane arrives from a foreign land . Customs men passengers encounter on arrival fall in @#  | two categories : inspectors , with black hats ; appraisers , with white ones . If you have no more than the $100 worth of merchandise allowed duty-free , you will see only the inspector . If your declaration totals more than $100 , or if you and the inspector differ as to the value of a purchase , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what 's in your luggage , but the appraiser is an expert in a certain type of goods . The " antique man , " for instance , is the one who politely explains that your silver service is less than a hundred years old and therefore dutiable . He knows his job well enough to remain unmoved if you plead , " But it 's been in my family longer than that ! " There are women inspectors , too . Their official function is to search any woman suspected of hiding something on her person . But they do more than that . Welldressed , they circulate among the passengers whose luggage has been examined , and they keep their ears open . People who have got away with something seldom can wait to spread the news . If they are within earshot of the woman inspector , their joy is short-lived . T HOUGH some deny it , Customs men are courteous . They are not the " deseand-dose " types the radio and movies portray . Nor are they the tourist 's enemy : they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know them . Conflics usually occur because a tourist knows his rights and privileges only too we : : and thinks he can improve them . He . or more often she , sees no point in declaring little items that , although acquired abroad , might just as well have been bought earlier in this country . Though such a woman shrinks from the horrid word , she is smuggling . Smugglir.s. is an undercover activity that John Q Public associates with Prohibition , ganesters , Al Capone , and the raucous ' 20 's He has a vague notion that some disreputable persons engage in it . But he certainly does n't consider himself a smuggler just because , when he alights from the Bermuda Clipper , he has a new and undeclared topcoat carelessly fold over his arm . And his wife would be dignant if you called her a smuggler cause the bottles in her medicine contain perfume . She would have decla them , of course ? she would rather ha the perfume in the original bottles she could n't , because that would her declaration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but incomplete answer is that they to save the price of the duty . Wo consider smuggling a kind of inn game . They apparently have little culty rationalizing their part in it . tainly they do not use such a h word as " smuggler " to describe th selves . Sometimes a woman merely w the satisfaction of putting something on a man . Sometimes , having bought dress for a price she later decides is most as much as Hattie Carnegie w charge , she feels she must get it in d free in order to convince herself she got a bargain . Her self-respect is volved , not the few dollars ' duty . As women see it , the Customs people do n't mind if they bring in a couple hundred dollars ' worth of and stuff , provided it 's strictly for their  | use and not to be sold . Naturally , they think if they have worn something for a few hours , it 's used clothing and does n't have to be declared . This lenient view is not shared by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear in its statement that all goods acquired abroad must be declared . The Bureau is aware that some women get away with smuggling , but they certainly do n't do it with the Bureau 's blessing or connivance . Nor is it always with the blessing or connivance of the women 's husbands , who are often in the dark until the inspector turns up something . When this happens , the husbands sometimes are exceedingly irate . One marriage practically broke up on the pier when the husband of returning honeymooners learned that his wife had attempted to smuggle . He told the inspector to give her the works . There is no record of what she later told him . More women than men attempt to smuggle . According to one cynical Customs man , all women are potential smugglers . But the female of the species , though she may be more persistent , is not more deadly than the male . Women are petty smugglers ; men often smuggle in a big way . When caught , they usually pay smilingly . They have little sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when caught are more likely to put on a show . They cry ; they plead poverty ; they try to bargain . Many passengers are convinced that the treatment they get depends on the inspector ? if he 's an easy one , they have nothing to worry about ; if he 's a mean , inconsiderate one , they 're in for it . Actually , there is not much difference among inspectors . Some are more genial than others , or seem more easygoing ; but in the performance of their duties they are much the same . TECHNIQUES of smuggling vary from the hackneyed to the highly ingenious . The most hackneyed is replacing a foreign label with a domestic one . The would-be smuggler should save himself the trouble . For one thing , the new label often does n't fit exactly over the spot occupied by the original one ; for another , inspectors do n't pay much attention to labels . They know a foreign garment by its cut and material . If it is fur , they can tell by the dresser 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt , he calls an appraiser . Each appraiser has his " line " ? the type of merchandise in which he is a specialist . One man is an expert in furs , another in piece goods , another in prints and ographs . The " gown man " knows more ut women 's clothes than Mrs. Harrison illiams does . " Gown men " have a ' que opportunity to get the preseason down on Paris styles . They appraise the purchases passengers bring and ercial importations . Through their rtment pass the selections of expenshops , and a fashion show is put on their benefit . Women who insist they ed up some little frock on a side street twenty-five dollars have n't much ce . Sometimes the appraiser tells they bought it and for how much . orninent people , especially movie usually are cooperative and careful preparing their declarations . Perhaps are more honest than the rest of us ; ps they fear unfavorable publicity . big shot who tries to throw his weight d generally gets an extra-thorough ation . Even the great grow mild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be on the alert , because smugglers are constantly thinking up new techniques and devices . And inspectors are handicapped by lack of time . They can not search everything thoroughly . But they do develop sensitive fingers . That casual probing tells more than the passenger realizes . Quick thinking and sound deduction sometimes catch a clever or bold smuggler . One such , after the examination , was asked to sign his declaration . He reached into his vest pocket and selected one of four pens . It would n't write . " Let me look at that pen , " said the inspector . The man gave it up reluctantly . It was filled with diamonds . So were two more . Jewels have been discovered in soap , razor cases , and toothpaste . During Prohibition , when many returning Americans felt it their duty to smuggle liquor , the Bureau of Customs permitted a few of its men to roam in civilian clothes among the passengers who had been examined . Posing as a fellow passenger , one of them would sidle up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get away with ? " " Plenty , " the tourist often would boast . " Yeah ? Come over here , mister . " A few tourists are scrupulously honest , but inspectors have been too long at their jobs not to look somewhat suspiciously on an excessive show of honesty , which they consider more unnatural than petty smuggling . Sometimes a seasoned traveler , seeking to spare herself a routine search of her luggage , informs the inspector that , although she herself has nothing dutiable , Mrs. So-and-So over there is trying to smuggle jewelry . That 's the only clue the inspector needs to give her own luggage a complete going-over . HOW much smuggling tourists get away with is anybody 's guess . It may be that the Customs people , in an unconscious effort to proclaim their efficiency , underrate the total ; but the chances are there is less smuggling than one would gather from the conversations one hears . You can not trust what people say when they claim to have put something over . They often exaggerate . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exaggerate a dishonesty that " is n't really dishonest , " as they are only gypping the government . Of course , some tourists do outsmart the Customs . Inspectors are not equally bright , and they are human . The more amiable you are , the more amiable they are likely to be . A bright inspector sizes you up as he walks with you to your luggage . If you seem reluctant to open certain bags , he may be especially curious to look into them . Some people obviously expect the worst and treat the inspector as a potential enemy . They often get the worst . In answer to the question , " Do you have anything you have n't declared ? " ( always asked , in order to give the passenger 's conscience a last chance ) , one woman replied , " That 's for you to find out . " It 's just as well to speak pleasantly to Customs men . But do n't overdo it . That arouses suspicion . Usually , the more experienced a traveler is , the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good inspector to tell much about a passenger from his appearance and manner , for extremes of behavior are found among the honest and the dishonest . When caught with an undeclared item , some people confess ; others must be confronted by the most damaging evidence before they will admit the slightest guilt . Most smugglers believe that , if caught , the worst thing that can happen is a fine . Actually , the law provides that they can Je not only fined ( not over $5,000 ) but imprisoned ( not over 2 years ) . Usually this " personal penalty " is reduced to a - Me equaling the " domestic value " of the article ? foreign value plus duty . The passenger may regain an article by again jaying the domestic value . Thus a woman : aught smuggling a coat worth $100 abroad , on which she should have paid i50 duty , will pay a $150 fine and another 5150 to get her coat back . She has n't : nerely lost her 6-to-1 bet ( $300 ? $50 ) , because it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolish . Not many smugglers are caught through informers , because about 75 percent of the informers act through spite , and their information is vague and undependable . One man reported his exfiancee 's mother , because he thought she had encouraged her daughter to break the engagement . If the informer 's information leads to a fine , he can collect 25 percent , though never more than $25 , - 000 . Cautious smugglers believe that even in the taxi carrying you home it is unwise to talk , because the cab driver may be an informer . The penalties collected are not inconsiderable . In some years they have equaled the duty collected on articles imported in baggage ? as high as five million dollars . The largest single penalty was $230,000 . In the lush days of the ' 30 's , it was nothing to collect from the passengers of a single luxury liner duty of twenty to thirty thousand dollars , and about as much in fines . Of course , duties collected on baggage are only a very small part of Customs collections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few bribery attempts , and inspectors are not permitted to accept ps . Sometimes a wary would-be smuger suggests that the inspector drop by e hotel later . Inspectors are not allowed accept such invitations ; if caught doing they are fired . Inspectors themselves e sometimes under scrutiny , and they .. ow it . Most of them are good fellows , who give the passenger all the breaks they can . One of them thought he was under surveillance when he was examining a certain passenger 's luggage , so he wade an unusually conscientious search . ne passenger , a stout gentleman with a handsome mustache , finally drawled , You would n't think I had once been sident . " The inspector glanced quickly : the name on the declaration . It was William Howard Taft . Before the war , about eleven million ears passed through border Customs each ar . By the end of the fiscal year 1946 , figure was twelve millon , and the first months of 1947 showed an increase two million over the same 1946 period . travel from foreign countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . e Bureau of Customs thinks it possible t in time the number of tourists who turn by ship will exceed that of the s .
