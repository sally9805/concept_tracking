The steamer succeeded the sailing vessel , but since trade has always been a matter of cheap modes of communication , Europe was able to continue at the head of the procession . And those military authors have been right who maintained that the nation with the biggest navy was also the nation that could dictate its will to the rest of the world . In obedience to this law , the Norsemen had been succeeded by Venice and Genoa , and Venice and Genoa had been succeeded by Portugal , and Portugal as a world-power had been succeeded by Spain , and Spain by Holland , and Holland by England , because each country in turn had had the largest number of battle-ships . Today , however , the sea is rapidly losing its former importance . The ocean as a highroad for commerce is being succeeded by the air . And perhaps it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rank of a second-rate continent as the invention of the heavierthan-air flying-machine . The son of a Genoese wool-merchant changed the course of history by discovering the unlimited possibilities of the ocean . The owners of a simple bicycle-repair-shop in the outskirts of Dayton , Ohio , did the same for the air . As a result , the children of a thousand years hence may never have heard the name of Christopher Columbus , but they will be familiar with Wilbur and Orville Wright . For it was a product of their patient and ingenious brains more than anything else which is gradually moving the center of civilization from the Old World to the New . VII OF THE DISCOVERY OF EUROPE AND THE SORT OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD THERE are twice as many people in Europe as there are in North and South America together . There are more people within the confines of that small continent than in America , Africa and Australia together . Only Asia has a greater number of inhabitants than Europe , 950,000,000 against Europe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less accurate for they were gathered by the International Statistical Institution connected with the League of Nations , a gathering of learned men who are able to consider such matters with a cool and detached eye and who are under no obligation to doctor the returns to please the local pride of any particular country . According to that same erudite body , the average net increase in population on this planet is 30,000,000 per year . And that is a very serious matter . For at that rate of speed , the population of the world will double itself in about six centuries . And as we still have millions and millions of years to go , I hate to think what conditions will be later on , in the year 19320 or 193200 or 1932000 . " Standing room only " in the subway is bad enough . " Standing room only " on our planet would be absolutely unbearable . And yet that is the prospect before us unless we are willing to face facts and take certain measures before it is too late . All that however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that faces us here is the following : Where did these early settlers of the European continent , who were to play such a great role in history , come from , and were they the first 81 // to arrive upon the scene ? The answer , I regret to say , must be exceedingly vague . Those people probably came from Asia and they probably entered Europe through the gap between the Ural Mountains and the Caspian Sea and they probably found that earlier races of immigrants and older forms of civilization had preceded them . But until the anthropologists shall have gathered many more data than are now at their disposal , the story of those pre-pre-historic invaders is still too vague to be incorporated in a popular handbook of geography and we must stick to the later arrivals . Why did they come ? For the same reason that made over a hundred million people move from the Old to the New World during the last hundred years ? because they were hungry and the lands toward the west offered them a better chance to survive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a later day were to scatter all over the great American plains . And in the mad rush for land and for lakes ( in those early days , a lake was even more valuable than a piece of land ) all traces of " pure racial stock " were speedily lost . Here and there along the more inaccessible parts of the Atlantic sea-shore or in the hidden depths of some obscure mountain valley , a few of the weaker tribes continued to vegetate , proud of their purity of race , but having little else to console them for the loss of touch with the outside world . And therefore when we speak of " race " today , we have given up all idea of absolute ethnological purity . We use the expression for the sake of convenience to describe certain large groups of people who happen to speak the same language ( more or less ) ; who have a common historical origin ( more or less ) ; and who during the last two thousand years of written history have developed certain traits of character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made them conscious of belonging to what , for lack of a better word , we continue to call a " racial group " . According to this notion of race ( the x of the algebraic equation , invented solely for the sake of cutting through a thousand // difficulties ) there are three great racial groups in the Europe of today and half a dozen smaller ones . There are , first of all , the Germanic races , such as the English , the Swedes , the Norwegians , the Danes , the Dutch , the Flemish and part of the Swiss . Then the Latin race , including the French , Italians , Spaniards , Portuguese and Roumanians . Finally the Slavic races , consisting mainly of the Russians and the Poles , the Czechs , the Serbians and Bulgarians . Together they account for about 93% of the total population . The rest are a couple of million Magyars or Hungarians , a slightly smaller number of Finns , about a million people of Turkish descent ( in the little remnant of the old Turkish Empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are the Greeks , who have been so hopelessly mixed with other " races " that we can only guess at their origin but who are more closely akin to the Germanic group than to any other . Finally the Albanians , also probably of Germanic origin , who now seem a thousand years behind the times but who had been comfortably settled on their present day farms five or six centuries ere the first of the Romans and Greeks made their appearance on European territory . And finally the Celts of Ireland , and the Letts and Lithuanians of the Baltic Sea , and the Gypsies , of indefinite number and hazy origin , who are chiefly interesting as an historical warning of what will happen to those who come too late and who arrive just when the last piece of empty land has been occupied by some one else . So much for the people who populated both mountains and plains of the old continent . Now we must see what they made of their geographical background and what that background in turn made of them . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , we would still be like the beasts of the fields . JUST A MOMENT BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER WHILE I TELL YOU HOW TO USE THIS BOOK This book should be read with an atlas . There are a large number of excellent atlases and almost any one will do . For atlases are like dictionaries . Even a bad one is better than none at all . As you will soon discover , there are quite a number of maps in this volume but these are not meant as a substitute for a regular atlas . I drew them merely to show you the many ways of approach to the subject under discussion and ( if I must tell the truth ) to get you personally interested in drawing maps according to your own notion of the geographical right and wrong . You see , flat maps , however ingeniously conceived , must be somewhat out of gear . The only approximately correct maps are those pasted on globes but even our globes are not entirely above suspicion for they should really be spheroids . We make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth , of course , is slightly flattened near the poles but it would take a gigantic globe to show the difference , and so we need not worry about that minor irregularity . Get yourself a globe ( I wrote this book with the help of a ten-cent-store globe which was really a pencilsharpener ) and use it to your heart 's content , but remember that it is an " approximation " and not an " established fact " . The " established facts " will only enter into your life if you should try to qualify for a master mariner 's certificate . But in that case , you would have to spend many years mastering an exceedingly difficult branch of science ; and this book was not writ for specialists but for the average reader who wants to get some general ideas about the planet upon which he happens to live . Now let me tell you one thing . The best and most convenient way to learn geography is to revaluate everything into pictures . 85 // Do n't copy me or anybody else . Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but regard them merely as a sort of geographical appe-tizer , as polite suggestions for the meal you intend to prepare yourself by and by . I have tried to give you quite a number of samples according to the geographical notions of the author himself . I have drawn you two-dimensional maps and three-dimensional maps . It will take you some time to get accustomed to these three-dimensional contraptions but , once you see them , you will no longer like the two-dimensional variety . I have given you maps as seen from mountain tops and according to the different angles from which you are able to contemplate a landscape . And I have given you maps as seen from aeroplanes and Zeppelins and the sort of maps we might expect to see if the oceans should run dry . I have given you a few maps which are merely pretty and ornamental and others which resemble geometrical patterns . Take your choice , HOW TO USE THIS BOOK and then draw your own maps according to your own notions of how the thing should be done . Draw maps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large globe and an atlas . Buy yourself a pencil and a pad of paper , and then draw your own pictures . For there is only one way in which you can learn geography so that you will never forget it ? draw pictures . VIII GREECE , THE ROCKY PROMONTORY OF THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN WHICH ACTED AS THE CONNECTING LINK BETWEEN THE OLD ASIA AND THE NEW EUROPE THE Greek peninsula is the southernmost point of the much larger Balkan peninsula . This is bounded on the north by the Danube , on the west by the Adriatic , which separates it from Italy , on the east by the Black Sea , the Sea of Marmora , the Bosporus and the Aegean Sea , which separate it from Asia , and on the south by the Mediterranean , which separates it from Africa . I have never seen the Balkan peninsula from the air but it seems to me that from a high distance it must look like a hand , reaching out from Europe to Asia and Africa . Greece is the thumb . Thrace the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The other fingers are the mountain-ranges that run from Macedonia and Thessaly to Asia Minor . Only the tops of these mountain-ranges are visible . The lower parts are covered by the waves of the Aegean , but from a great height one would undoubtedly be able to follow them as closely as the fingers of a hand partly submerged by the water in a wash-bowl . The skin of this hand is stretched across a skeleton of sturdy mountain-ranges . In the main , these run from north-west to south-east , I might almost say , diagonal-wise . They have Bulgarian , Montenegrin , Serbian , Turkish , Albanian and Greek names but there are only a few important enough for you to remember . These are the Dinaric Alps , stretching from the Alps of Switzerland to the Gulf of Corinth , the wide bay which separates the northern half of Greece from the southern half , the triangle 89 // which the early Greeks mistook for an island ( small wonder , since the isthmus of Corinth which connects it with the mainland s only about three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Peloponnesus or the Island of Pelops , who , according to Greek tradition , was the son of Tantalus and a grandson of Zeus , and who at Olympia was honored as the father of all good sportsmen . The Venetians who conquered Greece during the Middle Ages were prosaic merchants with no interest in a young man who once upon a time in his career had been served up as a roast at his father 's dinner table . They found that a map of the Peloponnesus looked very much like the leaf of a mulberry-tree . And so they called it the Morea , and that is the name you will find on all modern atlases . There are two mountain-ranges in this part of the world which have a separate existence of their own . In the north there are the Balkans which have given their name to the entire peninsula . The Balkans are merely the southern end of a half circle of hills of which the northern part is known as the Carpathians . They are cut off from the rest of the Carpathians by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through which the Danube has dug itself a path on its way to the sea ; and they act as a barrier which forces the Danube to run straight from east to west and to lose itself finally in the Black Sea instead of the Aegean Sea , towards which that river seems bound when it leaves the plains of Hungary . Unfortunately , this wall separating the peninsula from Roumania is not as high as the Alps and so does not succeed in protecting the Balkan region from the chilly blasts that come blowing down from the great Russian plain . The northern part of the peninsula therefore is quite familiar with snow and ice , but ere the clouds can reach Greece they are stopped by a second wall , the Rhodope Mountains which , by their very name of the " rose-covered hills " ( the same word as you will find in rhododendron , the rose-tree , and in Rhodes , the " rose-covered island " of the Aegean ) , indicate a milder climate . // The Rhodope Mountains reach a height of almost 9000 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the famous Shipka pass which the Russian armies forced in September of 1877 amidst a great deal of discomfort , is only 8000 feet . The Rhodope Mountains therefore play a very important part in deciding the climate of the rest of the peninsula , and for good measure there is snow-covered Olympus , 10,000 feet high , // which stands sentinel over the plains of Thessaly , where the real Greece begins . This fertile plain of Thessaly was once upon a time an inland sea . But the river Peneus ( the Salambria of the modern map ) cut itself a road-bed through the famous valley of Tempe , and the vast Thessalian lake emptied itself into the Gulf of Saloniki and became dry land . As for Thessaly , the granary of ancient Greece , the Turks neglected it , as they neglected everything , not so much through wickedness of heart as that hopeless Mohammedan inertia which answers all questions of immediate practical importance with a shrug of the shoulder and a brief " What is the use ? " And as soon as the Turks had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peasants and continued where the others had left off . Today Thessaly is raising tobacco . It has one harbor , Volo , from which the Argonauts set forth on their quest of the Golden Fleece , a story that was already hoary with age long before the heroes of Troy were born . It also has one industrial town and railroad center , Larissa . As a matter of curiosity and in order to show how strangely people got scrambled in the olden days , I might mention that this city in the heart of the Greek land of Thessaly has a negro quarter of its own . The Turks , who did not care who got killed fighting their battles for them , had imported several regiments of Sudanese natives from their Egyptian possessions to help them suppress the great Greek uprising of 1821-1829 . Larissa was their headquarters during that war and after the war the poor Sudanese were forgotten . They remained stranded and they are still there . But you will meet with stranger things than that ere we get through . You will hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China and horses on an uninhabited island in the Atlantic Ocean . This much for the benefit of the " pure race " enthusiasts . From Thessaly we cross the Pindus Mountains into the Epirus . This mountain-range , as high as the Balkans , has always been a barrier between the Epirus and the rest of Greece . // Why Aristotle should have identified this part of the world with the original home of the human race will ever remain a mystery , for it is a poverty-stricken country of high hills and wandering herds of cattle , without harbors or decent roads . Of its early population little remained when the Romans on one of their campaigns sold 150,000 Epirotes into slavery ( the famous Roman way of establishing law and order ) . But two parts of the Epirus , separated from the mainland by narrow stretches of water from the Ionian Sea , are interesting . One is Ithaca , the legendary home of long-suffering Odysseus , and the other is Corfu , the early home of the Phaeacians , whose king , Alcinous , was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature and an example of gracious hospitality until the end of time . Today the island ( one of the Ionian islands , occupied first by Venice , later by the French , then by the English until ceded by them to Greece in 1869 ) is chiefly famous as the place of retreat for the defeated Serbian armies in the year 1916 and as a target for some very loose and useless shooting on the part of the Fascist navy only a few years ago . It has however a great future as a winter resort , but is undoubtedly situated on one of the great European earthquake belts . The Dinaric Alps have a bad record as earthquake producers , while the neighboring island of Zante suffered most severely from an earthquake as recently as 1893 . But earthquakes have never yet prevented people from going where it was pleasant to be and we can discount the element of danger . We shall meet with a great many volcanoes on our trip around the world and still find their gentle slopes more densely populated than the less energetic parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may . I proceed from the Epirus further towards the south , and behold , Boeotia ! I mention this region , which lies like a vast , empty soupplate between the hills of Attica towards the south and Thessaly and the mountains of the Epirus towards the north , most particularly because it is a classical example of that influence of Nature upon Man which I mentioned in the beginning of this book . // To the average Greek of the good classical days , a Boeotian , although he came from the land of Mount Parnassus , the home of the Muses , on the slopes of which the Delphic Oracle had established its shrine , was a clod-hopper , a heavy-witted rustic , a clown , an oaf , a lout , a gawk , a thick-skulled dunderpate , predestined for all the cheap slap-stick humor of the early stage . And yet , the Boeotians by nature were no less intelligent than the rest of the Greeks . Epaminondas , the strategian , and Plutarch , the biographer , were Boeotians but they had left their native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered from the poisonous vapors that arose from the swamp-ridden borders of Lake Copais . In plain , modern medical terms , they probably were victims of malaria , a disease which does not tend to make people brilliant-minded . The French Crusaders , who set up as rulers of Athens during the entire thirteenth century , began to drain these quagmires , and conditions among the Boeotians improved . The Turks , of course , allowed the mosquitoes to breed to their hearts ' content and the Boeotians grew worse . Finally under the new kingdom , a French and afterwards an English company let the muddy waters of Lake Copais flow into the Euboic Sea and turned the bottom of this inland sea into fertile pasture-land . Today the Boeotian is no more Boeotian than an Athenian or Brooklyn bootblack and , Heaven knows , they are quick-witted // enough to get an extra nickel out of a Scotchman or Armenian . The marshes are gone , the vapors are gone , the malaria mosquitoes are gone . And an entire country-side that had been derided for centuries as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to normal behavior by the draining of a few miasmic swamps . And then we come to Attica , most interesting of the Greek lands . Nowadays we take the train that goes from Larissa to Athens and that connects with the trunk-lines to Europe . But in the olden days , those who wanted to get from Thessaly in the north to Attica in the south had only one route at their disposal , the route of the famous pass of Thermopylae . It was not really a pass in the modern sense of the word ? a narrow gap between two high mountains . It was a narrow track , about 45 feet wide , between the rocks of Mount Oeta and the Gulf of Halae , which was part of the Euboic Sea . It was here that Leonidas and three hundred Spartans sacrificed themselves to the last man to save Europe from Asia , when they tried to halt the advancing hordes of Xerxes in the year 480 B. C. Two hundred years later it was here that the barbarous Gauls were prevented from invading Greece . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass played an important military role in the war between Turks and Greeks . Today the pass is no longer visible . The sea has retreated almost three miles from the mainland and all that remains is a fifth-rate bathing establishment where people afflicted with rheumatism and sciatica try to find relief in those hot springs ( " thermos " is Greek for " hot " , as you will know from " thermometer " and " thermos bottle " ) which gave their name to a battle-field which shall be remembered as long as mankind continues to honor those who died in defending a lost cause . As for Attica itself , it is a small triangle ? a rocky promontory bordered by the blue waters of the Aegean Sea . Between its many hills lie numerous small valleys , all of them having direct access to the sea and kept fresh and pure by the breezes that come in from the water-front . The ancient Athenians declared that their sharpness of wit and clearness of vision were due to the // delightful air they breathed . They may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage the thrifty malaria mosquito . As a result , the Athenians were healthy and kept healthy . They were the first people to recognize that man is not divided into two equal parts , body and soul , but that body and soul are one , that a healthy body is necessary to encourage a healthy soul , that a healthy soul is an indispensable part of a healthy body . In that air it was possible to look all the way from the Acropolis to the Pentelian Mountains that dominated the plain of Marathon and provided the city with marble . But it was not only the climate that made the Athenians what they were , and for that matter are to this very day . There was the sea that gave the people of Attica direct access to every part of the inhabited and uninhabited world . And there was that geological freak of Nature which had dumped a steep but flat-topped miniature mountain , a sort of mesa more than Soo feet high , 87o feet long and 435 feet wide , right in the heart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best Athenian honey ) , by Mt . Pentelicus and by that Aegaleus from the slopes of which the unhappy fugitives from Athens watched the annihilation of the Persian fleet in the straits of Salamis a few days after the troops of Xerxes had set their city on fire . This flat-topped , steeply sloped hill had first of all attracted the immigrants from the north , for there they found what we all need ? food and safety . It is a curious fact that both Athens and Rome ( or modern London or Amsterdam ) , the most important settlements of ancient Europe , were situated not immediately on the sea but several miles away from it . The example of Cnossos , the Cretan center of the Mediterranean world hundreds of years before either of them had been founded , may have acted as a warning of that dreadful thing that may happen when one is forever exposed to a surprise attack by pirates . Athens , however , was more conveniently near to the sea than Rome . A short time after he had landed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , // the Greek sailor could be with his family . The Roman merchant needed three days for the trip . That was a little too long . He lost the habit of going back to his home city , settled down in the port at the mouth of the Tiber , and Rome gradually lost that intimate touch with the high seas which is of such tremendous benefit to all nations aspiring to world domination . But gradually these mesa people , these inhabitants of the " top city " ( for that is what acro-polis meant ) moved into the plain , built houses around the foot of their hill , surrounded them with walls , finally connected these fortifications and those of the Piraeus and settled down to a glorious life of trade and robbery which ere long made their impregnable fortress the richest metropolis of the entire Mediterranean Sea . Then their Acropolis was given up as a place of abode and became a shrine ? a shrine which lifted its white marble temples proudly against the violet-tinted sky of Attica ? a shrine which even today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of its more important buildings ( during the siege of Athens in 1645 ) , remains unique and sublime among those show-places where the genius of man is revealed in its highest forms of perfection . When Greece regained her liberty in 1829 , Athens had dwindled down to a mere village of 2000 inhabitants . In 1870 it had a population of 45,000 . Today it has 700,000 , a growth that is only paralleled by some of our own western cities . If the Greeks had not gambled with fate immediately after the Great War and had not foolishly thrown away all those immensely valuable possessions they had acquired in Asia Minor , Athens today would be the center of a mighty Aegean power . But all that may still happen in the near future . The mills of the Gods grind slowly but they continue day and night . And the city called after the shrewdest and wisest daughter of Zeus , born out of her father 's brain , has shown itself to have a tremendous power of recuperation . This brings us to the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there , alas , our confident and prophetic words of hope are of no further avail . The curse that rested upon Pelops on account of his father 's great wickedness has never been lifted from the land upon which that unfortunate prince bestowed his name . Here , hidden from the sea by mighty mountain-ranges , lay the idyllic land of Arcadia , praised by all poets as the home of simple but honest and lovable shepherds and shepherdesses . Poets are apt to wax most enthusiastic about that of which they know least . For the Arcadians were not more honest than the rest of the Greeks . If they did not practice the shabby tricks of their more sophisticated fellow-Hellenes , it was not because they disapproved of them . It was simply because they had never heard of them . It is true they did not steal , but there was nothing worth the taking in a country of dates and goats . They did not lie , but their hamlets were so small that everybody knew everything about everybody anyway . And if they kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worshipped in Eleusis and other Athenian centers of mysteries , they had a deity of their own , the great God Pan , who could give cards and spades to all the other Olympians when it came to coarse jokes and the low wit of barn-yard yokels . It is true , then as now the Arcadians could fight , but it did them little good , for like most peasants they loathed discipline and could never agree who would be their commander-in-chief . Southward of mountainous Arcadia stretched the plain of Laconia , a fertile plain , infinitely more fertile than the valleys of Attica , but sterile as to independence of thought and barren of all ideas that stretched beyond the mere necessities of life . In this plain the most curious city of antiquity was situated . Its name was Sparta and it stood for everything the northern Greeks held in abhorrence . Athens said " yea " unto life and Sparta said " nay " . Athens believed in inspired brilliancy , while Sparta worked towards efficiency and service . Athens proudly preached the divine right of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreary monotony of the mediocre . Athens opened its doors // wide to foreigners . Sparta kept them out of the country or murdered them . The Athenians were born traders , but no Spartan was allowed to soil his hands with business . If we are to judge by the final success of these two policies , the town of Sparta did not do so well . The spirit of Athens has penetrated the whole world . The spirit of Sparta has gone the way of the city that gave it birth ? it has disappeared . You will find a place called Sparta on the modern maps of Greece . It is a village composed of small scale farmers and humble keepers of silk-worms . It was built in 1839 on the spot where ancient Sparta was supposed to have stood . English enthusiasm provided the money , a German architect drew the plans . But no one wanted to go and live there . Today after almost a century of effort , it has 4000 inhabitants . The old curse of Pelops ! A curse that makes itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? a curse that comes to full fruition in the prehistoric fortress of Mycenae . The ruins of Mycenae are not far away from Nauplia , the best-known harbor of the Peloponnesus , situated on the gulf of that name . The town was destroyed five centuries before the birth of Christ . But to us people of the modern world it is of more direct importance than even Athens or Rome . For it was here that long before the beginning of written history , civilization for the first time touched the shores of savage Europe . In order to understand how this came about , look at the three half-submerged ridges of the great Balkan hand that reaches from Europe to Asia . These fingers are composed of islands . Those islands nowadays belong to Greece except for a few in the eastern part of the Aegean which Italy has occupied and continues to occupy for the reason that no other nation wants to go to war on account of a few worthless rocks in a distant sea . For convenience ' sake we divide those islands into two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sporades near the coast of Asia Minor . Those islands , as St. Paul already knew , are within short sailing distance of each other . And they formed the too VAN LOON 'S GEOGRAPHY bridge across which the civilization of Egypt and Babylonia and Assyria moved westward until it reached the shores of Europe . Meanwhile that civilization , under the influence of those early immigrants of Asiatic origin who had settled down on the Aegean islands , had already been very distinctly " easternized " and it was in that form that finally it reached Mycenae which should have become what Athens afterwards became , the center of the classical Greek world . Why did n't this happen ? We do not know . No more than we know why Marseilles , the logical successor to Athens as the dominating power of the Mediterranean , should have been forced to surrender that honor to a very modern and very upstart village called Rome . The short-lived glory of Mycenae and its abrupt decline will ever remain a mystery . But , you will object , all that is history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But in Greece , as in many ancient lands , history and geography have become so interwoven that the two can not be discussed separately . And from a modern point of view there are only a few geographical items really worth mentioning . The isthmus of Corinth has been pierced by a canal about three miles long but too shallow and too narrow for large vessels . Greece , as a result of a series of wars with Turkey ( alone and together with Bulgaria , Serbia and Montenegro ) , almost doubled its territory , then lost one-half of all those new acquisitions because in her dreams of grandeur she underestimated the fighting qualities of the Turks . The Greeks today , as in ancient times , take readily to the sea , and the blue and white flag of the republic ( the ancient Bavarian colors imported by the first king of the country after it had regained its independence in 1829 ) is to be seen in every part of the Mediterranean . Also occasionally in the North Sea and the Baltic , where such Grecian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous for their slovenliness and dirt . And for the rest , there are the figs and the olives and currants that are exported to all countries that care for such delicacies . GREECE IOI Will Greece ever return to her ancient glories as so many of her people hope and fervently expect ? Perhaps . But a nation overrun in turn by Macedonians , by Romans , by Goths and Vandals and Herulians and Slays , conquered and turned into a colony by Normans , Byzantines , Venetians and the unspeakable riff-raff of the Crusades , then almost completely depopulated and repopulated by Albanians , forced to live under Turkish domination for almost four entire centuries and used as a base of supply and a battlefield by the forces of the Allies in the Great War ? such a nation has suffered certain hardships from which it will find it extremely difficult to recuperate . As long as there is life , there is hope . But it is a mighty slender one . IX ' TALY , THE COUNTRY WHICH DUE TO ITS GEOGRAPHICAL SITUATION COULD PLAY THE ROLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEMANDED GEOLOGICALLY speaking , Italy is a ruin ? all that is left of a vast mountain complex which formed a square like modern Spain but which withered away ( as even the hardest rock will do in the course of a few million years ) and finally disappeared beneath the waters of the Mediterranean . Only the easternmost part of that ancient mountain-range is visible today , the Apennines , which reach from the valley of the Po to Calabria in the toe of the boot . Corsica , Elba and Sardinia are visible remnants of that high prehistoric plateau . Sicily was of course another part of it . Here and there in the Tyrrhenian Sea small islands betray the presence of ancient pinnacles . It must have been a terrific tragedy when all that land was captured by the sea . But as it happened some 20,000,000 years ago , when the earth suffered from the last of its great volcanic epidemics , there was no one present to tell the tale . And in the end it proved to be of enormous benefit to those who afterwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them a country enjoying such sublime natural advantages of climate , soil and geographical location that it seemed almost predestined to become the dominating power of antiquity and one of the most important factors of the development and dissemination of art and knowledge . Greece was the hand that reached out to Asia , caught hold of the ancient civilization of the valleys of the Nile and the Euphrates , and re-exported this article to the rest of Europe . But all that time the Greeks themselves remained something apart 102 // from the continent upon which they bestowed their manifold blessings . Their country might just as well have been an island . The fact that it was a peninsula did not do it any good , for rows and rows of mountains , indeed , the whole of the Balkan range , cut it off from the rest of European humanity . Italy , on the other hand , enjoyed the advantages of being both a sort of island , surrounded on three sides by the sea , while at the same time being very distinctly a part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact and talk of Spain and Greece and Italy as if they more or less resembled each other . Spain and Greece had much in common . The Pyrenees and the Balkan mountain-ranges were impassable barriers between north and south . But the great plain of the Po was a salient that reached well up into the heart of Europe . The northernmost cities of Italy enjoy a higher latitude than Geneva or Lyons . Even Milan and Venice are of a higher latitude than Bordeaux and Grenoble , while Florence , which we unconsciously associate with the very heart of Italy , is almost on a line with Marseilles . And furthermore , the Alps , although much higher than the Pyrenees and the mountains of the Balkans , had been formed in such a way as to offer comparatively easy access from south to north . The Rhine and the Rhone , running parallel with the northern frontier of Italy , divided the Alps into two halves ; and therefore the valleys of the little brooks and streams running into the Rhine and Rhone , making an angle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the plain of the Po ? as Hannibal , with a whole circus of elephants , was the first to prove , to the great detriment of the unsuspecting Romans . Italy therefore was able to play a dual role , that of a maritime nation , dominating the Mediterranean , and that of a continental power , conquering and exploiting the rest of Europe . When the Mediterranean ceased to be a world sea and the discovery of America made the Atlantic Ocean the center of commerce and civilization , Italy lost its former advantages . Without coal and iron she could not hope to compete with the ITALY ' cos industrial countries of the west . But for almost twelve hundred years , from the founding of Rome in 753 B. C. till the fourth century of our era , Italy dominated and administered every part of Europe south of the Elbe and the Danube . Unto the wild Germanic tribes that had just arrived from Asia and were now quarreling violently for the possession of this desirable " far west " Italy gave their first conception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life over the uncertainties and filth of a merely nomadic existence . Of course she enriched herself incredibly at the expense of every one else . But while taking a heavy toll of taxes , she delivered certain " goods " that were to shape the destinies of all those different regions for all times to come . And even today , the more than casual observer , visiting Paris or Bucharest , Madrid or Treves , will at once be struck by a certain similarity of look and outlook on the part of the inhabitants . He will be surprised that he can read the signs on the shops , no matter whether they are in French or Spanish or Roumanian or Portuguese . And then he will realize : " I am in an old Roman colony here . All this land once upon a time belonged to Italy just as the Philippines today belong to us . The first houses were built by Italian architects , the first streets were laid out by Italian generals , the first traffic and commercial regulations were written in the tongue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what tremendous natural advantages were enjoyed by this country that was at once an island and part of the mainland . At the same time the fortunate geological accident which had enabled Italy to conquer the whole of the known world carried with it certain very decided drawbacks . A country born out of volcanic upheavals was forever threatened to be killed by the very mother that had given it birth . For Italy is not only the classical land of moonlit ruins , orange trees , mandolin concerts and picturesque peasants . It is also the classical land of volcanic eruptions . Every Italian who reaches the normal threescore and ten ( easy in a country where laughter and gracious manners seem to 1o6 VAN LOON 'S GEOGRAPHY come as natural as grouchy grins and boorishness do in other less favored parts of the world ) is sure to have been an active par-ticipant in at least one major earthquake and a couple of minor ones before he is reverently carried to the family lot in the Campo Santo . The seismograph ( most reliable of instruments I wish all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the period of 1905 ? 1907 alone . The next year , 1908 , Messina was completely destroyed . If you want a few vital statistics ( and mere figures are often infinitely more elo-quent than pages of print ) here is the record for the island of Ischia , situated just opposite Capri . That island alone suffered from earthquakes in 1228 , 1302 , 1762 , 1796 , 1805 , 1812 , 1827 , 1828 , 1834 , 1841 , 1851 , 1852 , 1863 , 1864 , 1867 , 1874 , 1875 , 1880 , 1881 , 1883 , etc. , etc . As a result of these millions of years of volcanic eruptions , enormous tracts of Italian land got gradually covered with thick layers of tufa or tuff , a soft sort of rock composed of volcanic ash , thrown up by craters when in a state of violent eruption . These layers of tufa are very porous and they have a very de-cided influence upon the landscape of the entire peninsula . Some of those tufa fields cover areas of not less than 4000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really nothing but heaps of hardened volcanic ash . But there are other geological developments , also the result of prehistoric upheavals , which make the soil of Italy so treach-erous . The Apennines , which run the entire length of the penin-sula , dividing it nearly into halves , are for a great part com-posed of limestone , a softish substance which lies on top of the older and harder rock formations . This limestone is apt to slide . The ancient Italians were so thoroughly familiar with this fact hat even in the absence of volcanic upheavals they used to in-spect the boundary lines of every large country estate once in twenty years to see whether the stone marks , indicating where one man 's property ended and another man 's began , were still in their correct position . And the modern Italians are made to realize this " sliding process " of their soil ( and in a very costly // and painful way ) every time a railroad is pushed out of shape or a road is squashed to pieces or another village is rolled down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit Italy you will be surprised at the large number of towns perched on the tops of high hills . The usual explanation is that the original inhabitants fled to those eagles ' nests for safety 's sake . That , however , was only a secondary consideration . When they moved to those uncomfortable pinnacles , so far removed from the wells of the valley and the main routes of communication , they did so primarily to avoid the dangers of sliding to death . Near the top of the mountains the base rocks of the ancient geological structure usually came to the surface and offered future residents a permanent place of abode . The sides of the hills , covered with soapy limestone , were as dependable as quicksand . Hence those picturesque villages that look so mar ? vellous from a distance and are so incredibly uncomfortable once one is inside . And this brings us to a consideration of modern Italy . For Italy , unlike Greece , does not merely have its future behind it . It works intelligently and courageously towards a new goal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to undo the damage of a thousand years of neglect and once more regain its ancient and honorable status among the ranking nations of the earth . In the year 1870 Italy once more became a united nation and as soon as the struggle for independence was over and the foreign rulers had been driven back across the Alps ( where they belonged ) the Italians started upon the gigantic and well nigh hopeless task of putting their long-neglected house in order . First of all they turned their attention to the valley of the Po ? the larder from which the whole peninsula could be conveniently fed . The Po is not a very long river as rivers go . As a matter of fact , if you will look at the picture of the comparative length of rivers , you will notice that the Volga is the only European river that is a fit candidate for such honors . The Po , which keeps close to 45 ? N. Lat. , is only 420 miles long but its basin area , the territory from which it draws its tributaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its direct influence , is 27,000 square miles . That is not as much as several other rivers have , but the Po has some other qualities which make it unique . It is navigable for fully five-sixths of its entire length and it is one of the fastest delta-builders of the world . Every year it adds almost three-quarters of a square mile to its delta and pushes it 200 feet further outward . If it continues to do this for another ten centuries , it will have reached the opposite coast of the Istrian peninsula and Venice will be situated on a lake , separated from the rest of the Adriatic by a dam seven miles wide . Part of this vast amount of sediment which the Po carries to the sea has of course sunk to the bottom of the river and has filled it up with a layer of solid substance several feet thick . In order to keep the ever-rising river from flooding the surrounding landscape , the people living along its banks had to build dikes . They began to do this in Roman times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the surface of the Po is much higher than the plain through which it flows . In several villages the dikes are thirty feet high and the river runs at the same height as the roofs of the houses . But the Po region is famous for something else . Once upon a time , and not so very long ago , geologically speaking , the entire northern plain of Italy was part of the Adriatic Sea . Those lovely Alpine gorges which are now so popular with the summer tourists were narrow bays , like the fjords , the submerged valleys of the modern Norwegian mountains . These valleys were the outlet for the water that descended from the glaciers which then covered the greater part of Europe and of course a great deal more of the Alps than they do today . Glaciers get thickly covered with stones that roll down on them from the mountain slopes between which they pass on their way downwards . Such fringes of rocks are called moraines . When two glaciers meet , two moraines are bound to combine into a moraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then called a " median moraine " , and when the glacier finally melts , it drops this rocky ballast , which is called the " terminal moraine " . // These terminal moraines are a sort of geological beaver-dam , for they close the uppermost part of the valley off from the lower . As long as the glacier period lasts , there will be enough water to make the terminal moraines a negligible hindrance for the water on its downward course . But gradually , as the glaciers disappear and there is less and less water , the terminal moraine rises higher than the water and we get a lake . All the north Italian lakes , the Lago Maggiore , the Lago di Como and the Lago di Garda , are moraine lakes . When man appeared upon the scene and began his works of irrigation , those moraine lakes acted as handy reservoirs . For in the spring , when the snow began to melt , they caught the surplus water which , if it had descended upon the valley in one solid body , would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can rise twelve feet and the Lago Maggiore as much as fifteen feet and still take care of the extra water . A simple system of locks will then do the rest and tap those lakes according to the necessities of the day . At a very early date the inhabitants of the great Po plain began to make use of this fortunate circumstance . They connected with canals the hundreds of little streams that feed the Po . They built dams and dikes and today thousands of cubic feet of water pass through these canals every few minutes . It was an ideal region for the growing of rice . In the year 1468 the first rice plants were introduced by a Pisa merchant and today the rice-terraces are a common sight of the central plain of the Po . Other crops , corn and hemp and beet-root , were added and the vast plain , although it has less rainfall than the rest of the Italian peninsula , is the most fertile region of the entire country . But not only did it provide man with food . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ninth century , the mulberry tree , which is the basic necessity for the cultivation of the silk-worm , made its entrance , brought hither from China by way of Byzantium , the eastern half of the Roman Empire , which survived until 1453 when the Turks took its chief city , Constantinople , and turned it into the capital of their own empire . no VAN LOON 'S GEOGRAPHY The mulberry tree needs a great deal of heat . It found ideal living conditions in Lombardy , the plain of the Po , so-called after the Lombards or Long Beards , a Teutonic tribe from the mouth of the Elbe who lived here for a long time . Today almost half a million people are engaged in the silk industry and their product ranks much higher than that of China and Japan , the original home of Bombyx Mori , that inconspicuous little insect who provides us with the most luxurious of our wearing apparel . No wonder that the whole of the plain is densely populated . The original town builders , however , kept at a safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet far enough advanced to provide them with reliable dikes and furthermore they feared the marshes which were an annual occurrence after the spring floods . Turin , the old residence of the house of Savoy , which now rules over the whole of Italy , and the connecting point for the passes that lead into France and Switzerland ( the pass of the Mont Cenis going to France and the St. Bernard pass , famous for its dogs and monastery , giving access to the valley of the Rhone ) is the only city of any importance directly situated on the Po . But it is so high that it needed have no fear of drowning . As for the other cities , Milan , the capital of that region , meeting-point for five important trade-routes ( the St. Gothard road , the Simplon , the small St. Bernard , the Malo j a and the Splugen pass ) , lies half way between the river and the Alps . Verona , the end station of the Brenner pass , one of the oldest connections between Germany and Italy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , famous as the home of Stradivarius , Guarnerius and the Amati family , the fiddle-making dynasties , lies on the Po , but Padua and Modena , Ferrara and Bologna ( the home of one of the oldest universities of Europe ) are all at a safe distance from that main artery upon which they depend for their prosperity . The same is true of two of the most romantic cities of the ancient world , Venice and Ravenna . Venice , the town in which 157 canals , 28 miles in length , serve the purpose of streets , was originally a place of shelter for those who no longer considered them-ITALY III selves safe on the mainland and who preferred the discomforts of the mud banks thrown up by the Po and several smaller rivers to the dangers that followed in the wake of the Great Migrations . Once there , these fugitives discovered that they had a gold mine in the salt which lay there , so to speak , for the picking . Their salt monopoly started them on the road to riches . Their straw-covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of warships . For almost three entire centuries they were the leading colonial power of the entire civilized world and high-hatted Pope , Emperor and Sultan with a most haughty and at the same time a most elegant air . When news of the safe return of Columbus and the discovery ( the supposed discovery , of course ) of the road to India reached the Rialto , their business quarter , there was a panic . All stocks and bonds dropped fifty points . For once the brokers were prophets , for Venice never recovered from this blow . Her well-protected trade-routes became a useless investment . Lisbon and Seville succeeded her as the international store-house towards which all of Europe turned for its spices and other Asiatic and American products . Venice , gorged with gold , became the Paris of the eighteenth century . All the rich young men who cared for a genteel education and some rather less genteel entertainment went to Venice . When the carnival began to last the greater part of the year , the end had come . Napoleon conquered the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there for you to admire . Another twenty years and the motor-boat will have destroyed them . The other city , also a product of Po mud , was Ravenna . Today it is an inland city removed from the Adriatic by six miles of mud . A dull hole , a city that must have driven such famous guests as Dante and Byron to drink and distraction . During the fifth century of our era it was more important than the New York of today , for it was the capital of the Roman Empire ? it harbored an enormous garrison and was the main naval base of that time , with the largest wharves and timber supplies . In the year 404 the Emperor decided that Rome was no longer safe . The barbarians were getting too powerful . And so // he moved to the " city in the sea " where he had a much better chance to protect himself against surprise attacks . Here he and his descendants lived and ruled and loved , as you may see to this very day when you stand speechless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life as a dancing girl in the circus of Constantinople and died in an odor of sanctity as Theodora , the beloved wife of the famous Emperor Justinian . Then the town was conquered by the Goths and turned into the capital of their newly founded empire . Then the lagoons began to fill up . Then Venice and the Pope fought for it . Then for a while it became the home of that pathetic exile , whose services to his native city of Florence had been rewarded by a threat of being burned at the stake . He spent silent hours among those famous pine forests that surrounded the city . Then he descended into his grave . And soon afterwards the famous old imperial residence followed his example . One more word about northern Italy . The kingdom has no coal but it has an almost unlimited supply of water-power . This water-power was just being harnessed when the war broke out .

On the western side , the great plain of the Po is cut off from the Mediterranean by the Ligurian Alps , the connecting link between the Alps proper and the Apennines . The southern slopes of the Ligurian Alps , completely protected against the cold breezes from the north , form part of the famous Riviera , the winter playground of all Europe , or rather of that part of Europe which can afford a lengthy railroad trip and fairly expensive hotels . Its chief city is Genoa , the chief port of the modern Kingdom and a city of the most imposing marble palaces , ITALY iit relics of the day when Genoa was the most dangerous rival of Venice for the colonial spoils of the Near East . Toward the south of Genoa lies another small plain , that of the river Arno . The Arno takes its origin among the mountains about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart of that city which during the Middle Ages lay on the highroad that connected Rome , the center of Christianity , with the rest of Europe and which was able to use this favored commercial position so cleverly that ere long it became the most important banking center of the world . One family especially , that of the Medici ( they started life as doctors , hence the three pills in their coat of arms , which became the three golden balls of our own pawnshops ) showed such brilliant gifts for that sort of work that they finally became hereditary rulers of the whole of Tuscany and were able to make their home town the most marvellous artistic center of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries . From 1865 to 1871 Florence was the capital of the new Italian kingdom . Then it dropped slightly back in importance , but it still is one of those places that one ought to have seen to appreciate how beautiful life can be if money and good taste happen to be present in a well-balanced ratio . The two cities near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loveliest garden spots to be found anywhere outside of the island of Java , are merely of some slight historical interest . Pisa has a leaning tower which leans because the architects were not very careful in laying their foundations , but which proved very handy when Galileo wanted to study the habits of falling objects . The other town is Livorno , which the English , for some curious reason , call Leghorn , and which is chiefly remembered as the town near which Shelley was drowned in the year 1822 . From Livorno southward the old stage-coach road as well as the modern railroad keep close to the seashore . They give the traveller a quick but hazy glimpse of the island of Elba ( Napoleon 's place of exile until he unexpectedly descended upon France to rush towards the final doom of Waterloo ) , and then // enter the plain of Tiber . This famous river , called the Tevere in Italian , is a sluggish and tawny current , vaguely reminiscent of the Chicago River but not quite so wide , and of the Spree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its origin among those Sabine Mountains where the earliest Romans went to steal their wives . In prehistoric times its mouth was only twelve miles west of Rome . Since then it has added two miles to its length , for like the Po , the Tiber is a first-rate mud-carrier . The plain of the Tiber is different from that of the Arno . It is much wider and while the Arno region is healthy and highly fertile , that of the Tiber is barren and a breeder of disease . The very word " malaria " was coined here by those medieval pilgrims who were firmly convinced that the " mal aria " ? the " bad air " ? was responsible for those dreadful attacks of fever which burned up the body while one was still alive . In consequence of this fear , all the houses in this neighborhood were hermetically sealed as soon as the sun had set . This system of preventative hygiene had one great disadvantage . It kept all the little mosquitoes carefully indoors , but as we only learned about the relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hardly blame our ancestors for that particular bit of ignorance , In Roman times this flat territory , the famous Campagna , was decently drained and fairly well populated . But because it lay open and unprotected along the shores of the Tyrrhenian Sea it was an ideal spot for the pirates who infested the whole of the Mediterranean as soon as the Roman policeman had disappeared . The towns were destroyed , the farms deserted , the drainage ditches neglected . Stagnant pools bred malaria mosquitoes and all during the Middle Ages and even as late as thirty years ago , this entire region from the mouth of the Tiber to the Pontine marshes near Monte Circeo was either avoided or passed through as fast as the unfortunate horse could drag the rattling coach . Arises the question , Why should the most important city of the ancient world have been founded in a plague-spot ? Why indeed ? Why was St. Petersburg built in a marsh which took hundreds of thousands of lives to drain ? Why was Madrid built on ITALY Its a bleak and treeless plateau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situated at the bottom of a large saucer , forever dripping with rain ? I do n't know . Chance mixed with greed ? or that famous political foresight which covers such a multitude of blunders ! Or chance alone or greed alone . I do n't know . And I am not writing a handbook of philosophy . Rome was built where it was built , regardless of an unhealthy climate , scorching summers , chilly winters , and an absence of all decent communications . And yet it grew to be the center of a world-wide empire , the holy shrine of a world-wide religion . Under such circumstances , do n't look for a single explanation . Look for a thousand different and inter-locking explanations . But do n't look for them here , for it would take three volumes like the present one to get to the bottom of the secret .

I ought to have felt a sense of trembling awe before the church devoted to St. Peter 's memory and martyrdom , and I could only deplore the waste of so much money upon a building that had not a single claim to either beauty or charm except that it was " bigger " than any other edifice constructed for a similar purpose .

We will let it go at that , but rather than spoil your taste for a city ii6 VAN LOON 'S GEOGRAPHY you will sometime see yourself , I duly note that Rome since the year 1871 is the capital of the kingdom of Italy and that it harbors a city within a city ? the so-called Vatican City ? which was surrendered to the Pope in the year 1930 and now gives the Pontiff that freedom of action which he had not enjoyed since that fateful day in September of 18 70 when the troops of the Italian Kingdom entered the city and proclaimed a constitution instead of that absolute sovereignty which had been the form of Roman government until then . The modern city of Rome has few industries . It has some terrible-looking monuments , a main street which reminds one of Philadelphia and many people in uniforms . The uniforms are good . And that brings us to another city , until recently the most populous of the entire peninsula , which is a strange mixture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face to face with that irritating puzzle , " Why did n't this city , enjoying every possible natural advantage , take the predominant place occupied by Rome , situated in a dead alley on a mean little river ? " For Naples was right on the sea front at the head of a magnificent bay . It was older than Rome and the territory around it was originally among the most fertile spots along the western Italian coast . Originally the Greeks , who founded Naples , had done their trading with the dangerous Apennine tribes from the safe distance of the island of Ischia . But Ischia proved too uncertain a proposition . It was forever trembling with volcanic emotions and the Greeks had moved to the mainland . The usual and apparently unavoidable quarrels between the colonists ( bored because far away from home and badly administered by grasping governors ) had caused civil strife and three or four little settlements had been destroyed ( it sounds like the beginning of our own country ) when a fresh batch of immigrants had decided to begin from the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " New City " or " Neapolis , " which eventually became Napoli , or in plain English , Naples . ITALY It was already a prosperous commercial center when Rome was still a village inhabited by shepherds , and yet those shepherds must have had a veritable genius for administration , for already in the fourth century before our era Naples was an " ally " of Rome , an agreeable-sounding term , much less harsh than the word " subject " but describing the same sort of relationship . And from that moment on , Naples played the second role , was afterwards overrun by whole hordes of barbarians and finally fell into the hands of one of the Spanish branches of the Bourbon family , whose rule became a byword for scandalous mismanagement and suppression of every form of independent thought and action . Nevertheless , such were the town 's natural advantages that it became the most over-crowded city of the European continent . How all those people lived , nobody knew and nobody cared until the cholera epidemic of 1884 forced the modern kingdom to clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severity . The background of this marvellous spot is most appropriately occupied by the ornamental Vesuvius . Vesuvius is the neatest and most systematic of all the known volcanoes in the way it spreads its ashes . It rises up to a height of about 4000 feet and is entirely surrounded by lovely little villages which grow a particularly fiery wine , the famous Lacrimae Christi . The ancestors of those villages already existed in Roman days . And why not ? Vesuvius was extinct . Since the memory of man , almost a thousand years , there had not been an eruption . There had been vague rumblings in the bowels of the earth in the year 63 , but that meant nothing in a country like Italy . The great surprise was sprung sixteen years later . In less than two days time Herculaneum and Pompeii and a third smaller city were so deeply buried beneath deep layers of lava and ashes that they completely disappeared from the face of the earth .

South of Naples we enter the province called Calabria . It suffers from the fact that it is so far away from the center of the country . It has railroad connections with the north but the coastal regions suffer from malaria , the central part is composed of granite , and agriculture is practiced as it was in the days of the first Roman Republic . A narrow strait , the strait of Messina , separates Calabria from the island of Sicily . The strait , which is only a little over a mile wide , was famous in antiquity for the presence of two whirlpools , called Scylla and Charybdis , which were said to swallow up whole ships if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their course . The fear those whirlpools aroused gives us an adequate idea of the helplessness of such ancient vessels , for a modern motor-boat putt-putts quietly right through the heart of these eddies without noticing that there is any commotion in the water . As for Sicily , its geographic position had made it the natural center of the ancient world . Furthermore it enjoyed a delightful climate , was densely populated and highly fertile . But like Naples , life here was perhaps a little too good , a little too easy , a little too comfortable , for the Sicilians during more than two thousand long years submitted peacefully to every form of misgovernment that foreign potentates wished to bestow upon them . When they were not being plundered or tortured by Phoenicians or Greeks or Carthaginians ( they were only about a hundred miles away from the northern coast of Africa ) or Vandals or Goths or Arabs or Normans or French or by any of the 1 20 princes , 82 dukes , 129 marquises , 28 counts and 356 barons who derived their titles from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the damage done by the local volcano , Mt .

ITALY ii The island of Malta is really a sort of aquatic suburb of Sicily and therefore ought to be mentioned here , although politically speaking it does not form part of Italy . It is a very fertile island and lies midway between Sicily and the coast of Africa . It dominates the trade-route from Europe to Asia by way of the Suez Canal . After the failure of the Crusades , it was presented to the knights of St. John who thereupon called themselves the Maltese Order , Knights of Malta . In the year 1798 Napoleon took the island on his way to drive the English out of India via Egypt and Arabia ( a most ingenious plan which however failed because the desert was so much larger than he had expected ) . This was an excuse for the English to occupy it two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to the chagrin of the Italians but not of the Maltese , who on the whole are better off than they would be under a government of their own people . I have paid little attention to the east coast of Italy , but it is not very important . In the first place , the Apennines used to reach almost as far as the water-front , making large settlements very difficult . As the other side of the Adriatic was practically uninhabitable on account of the steepness of its hills , the development of trade was not encouraged . From Rimini in the north to Brindisi in the south ( from where the mail leaves for Africa and India ) there are no harbors of any importance . The heel of the boot is called Apulia . Like Calabria it suffers from the fact that it is so far removed from civilization , and like Calabria its agricultural methods are those practiced in the days when Hannibal honored this region with his presence , waiting twelve long years for the help from Carthage that was never to come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finest natural harbors in the world but which , alas , has no customers . It is called Taranto and it gave its name to a particularly venomous sort of spider and to a dance by which the people who had been bitten by that spider were prevented from falling asleep and entering into a deadly coma . 12o VAN LOON 'S GEOGRAPHY The Great War has made geography very complicated , for no account of modern Italy is perfect without mention of the Istrian peninsula which was given to the Italians in recognition of the fact that they had turned against their own allies and joined with the enemy . The city of Trieste was the principal export harbor of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire . Having lost its natural hinterland , it is not doing so well . And finally , tucked away at the further end of the bay of Guarnero , is Fiume , another former possession of the Habsburgs . It was the natural outlet for the German people who had no other good port along the whole of the Adriatic coast . But fear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italians clamor for Fiume . When the statesmen who concluded the treaty of Versailles refused to give it to them , they simply took it , or rather , their poet d'Annunzio , an excellent writer and a great scoundrel , took it for them . Then the Allies turned it into a " free state " , but finally , after prolonged negotiations between Italy and Yugoslavia , it was ceded to Italy . That ends the present chapter , except for the island of Sardinia . This is really a very big island but it is so far away and so few people have ever been there that we sometimes forget that it exists . But it does exist , the sixth biggest island of Europe , covering an area of almost io , 000 square miles . Being the other extreme of that prehistoric mountain-range of which the Apennines were part , it turns its back upon the mother country . The western coast has excellent harbors . The east coast is steep and dangerous and has not a single convenient landing place . During the last two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Italy . Until the year 1708 it belonged to Spain . Then it went over into Austrian hands . In 1720 the Austrians swapped Sardinia against Sicily , which then belonged to the Dukes of Savoy . whose capital was the city of Turin , situated on the Po . Thereafter the Dukes of Savoy proudly called themselves Kings of Sardinia ( from duke to king is a decided step upward ) and that is how the modern kingdom of Italy happened to grow out of a kingdom called after an island which not one Italian in a hundred thousand has ever seen .

The Spaniard is supposed to be so " racially " different from any other group of people , that one will recognize him anywhere and under all circumstances by his racial haughtiness , his formal courtesy , his pride , his sobriety and his ability to play the guitar and the castanets .

The Spaniards merely took to playing the guitar and the castanets because in their dry and warm climate they were able to use out-of-door instruments . When it comes however to playing them really well , both Americans and Germans are greatly superior to the native talent . If they play them less frequently than the Spaniards do , that is the result of the climate under which they live . You ca n't very well play the castanets in the pouring rain of a cold Berlin evening nor the guitar when your fingers tremble with frostbite . And as for those qualities of pride and haughtiness and formal courtesy , were n't they all of them the result of centuries of hard military training , and was n't this military life the direct outcome of the fact that Spain was geologically speaking quite as much a part of Africa as of Europe ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europeans and Africans until either one side or the other should have won ? In the emd , the Spaniard was victorious , but the land for which he had been obliged to fight for such a long // time had left its imprint upon him . What would he have developed into if his cradle had stood in Copenhagen or Berne ? Into a perfectly ordinary little Dane or Swiss . Instead of playing the castanets , he would have yodeled , because the steep walls of a mountain valley with their marvellous echoes invite one to yodel . And instead of living on a little dry bread and sour wine , raised with infinite care and patience on his own neglected soil ( neglected again on account of that clash between Africa and Europe ) , he would have eaten a lot of butter , necessary to protect his body against the eternal dampness of the climate , and he would have drunk aquavit , because the abundant presence of cheap grain would have made gin the almost inevitable national beverage . And now look at the map . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greece they ran diagonally across the country . In Italy they ran in an almost straight line from north to south , dividing the country into halves but allowing enough space on both sides for the construction of roads that coasted the country from one end to the other , while the salient of the Po plain made the Apennine peninsula an integral part of the European continent . In Spain the mountains make horizontal ridges which one might almost describe as visible degrees of latitude . After a single glance at the map you will understand how these mountain-ranges must have acted as barriers to any sort of orderly progress . They begin with the Pyrenees . The Pyrenees , 240 miles long , run in a straight and uninterrupted line from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean . They are not as high as the Alps and therefore it ought to be easier to cross them by means of mountain passes . But that is not so . The Alps , although . very high , are also very wide and the roads that run across them , although quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties to either man or pack-horse . The Pyrenees on the other hand are only 6o miles wide , and as a result their mountain passes were much too steep for anybody // except a goat or a mule . According to well-seasoned travellers , even the mules experienced difficulties . Trained mountaineers ( mostly professional smugglers ) were able to get through , but only during a few months of summer . The engineers who built the railroads connecting Spain with the rest of the world realized this , for they built the two trunk lines from Paris to Madrid and from Paris to Barcelona along the shores of the Atlantic and the Mediterranean . Whereas the Alps have half a dozen railroad lines passing over them or under them , the Pyrenees , between Irun in the west and Figueras in the east , are not pierced by a single tunnel . After all , one ca n't very well dig a tunnel sixty miles long . Neither can one send trains across a track with an inclination of forty degrees . There is one fairly easy pass in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roland , Charlemagne 's famous Paladin , // died loyally serving his master 's interests until the moment he succumbed under the last of the Saracens ' attacks . Seven hundred years later , another army composed of Frenchmen used this pass as an entrance gate into Spain . They got across the pass itself but were stopped before Pamplona , the city that dominates the road on the southern side . During the siege , one of the Spanish soldiers , a certain Ignatius de Loyola , was desperately wounded through a shot in the leg . While recovering , he had those visions which inspired him to found the Company of Jesus , the famous Society of the Jesuits . The Jesuits afterwards did more to influence the geographic development of a vast number of countries than any other religious organization , more even than those indefatigable travellers , the Franciscans . It was here that they began , defending the only passage across the center of the Pyrenees . It was undoubtedly this inaccessibility of the Pyrenees which gave the famous Basque people their chance to maintain themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent Republic of Andorra , very high up in the eastern part of the mountains . The Basques , about 700,000 in number , inhabit a triangle that is bounded by the Gulf of Biscay in the north , by the Spanish province of Navarre in the east , while the western frontier follows a line from the city of Santander to the city of Logrono on the Ebro River . The name Basque means the same as our word Gascon , but it has nothing to do with the cronies of the famous Captain d'Artagnan . The Roman conquerors called them Iberians and called the whole of Spain the Iberian peninsula . As for the Basques themselves , they proudly say that they are Eskualdunak , which sounds very un-European and quite like Eskimo . Just for good measure , and because your guess is apt to be as sound as mine , here are a few of the current theories about the origin of the Basques . Some of the professors who distil racial theories out of skulls and gutturals , believe them to be connected with those Berbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of the earliest tribes // of prehistoric Europeans , the so-called Cromagnon race . Others claim that they are the survivors who saved themselves on the European continent when the romantic island of Atlantis disappeared beneath the waves of the ocean . Still others hold that they have always been where they are now and do n't bother to ask where they came from . Whatever the truth , the Basques have shown remarkable ability in keeping themselves aloof from the rest of the world . They are very industrious . More than a hundred thousand of them have migrated to South America . They are excellent fishermen and sailors and iron workers and they mind their own business and keep off the front page of the newspapers . The most important city of their country is Vitoria , founded in the sixth century by a Gothic king and scene of that famous battle in which an Irishman by the name of Arthur Wellesley , but better known by his English title of the Duke of Wellington , defeated the armies of a Corsican general by the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Emperor Napoleon , and forced the latter to leave Spain for good and all . As for Andorra , this strange commonwealth numbering fully soon inhabitants , connected with the outside world by a bridlepath , is the only surviving specimen of those queer little medieval principalities which retained their independence because , as frontier posts , they might render valuable service to some distant monarch and because afterwards they were too far removed from the busy outside world to attract anybody 's attention . The capital has boo inhabitants , but the Andorrans , like the Icelanders and the people of San Marino in Italy , were ruling themselves according to their own desires at least eight hundred years before we started our experiment in applied democracy . As a sister republic of great antiquity , Andorra should at least enjoy our sympathetic respect . Eight hundred years is a long time . Where shall we be in the year 2732 ? In one other respect , the Pyrenees are quite different from // the Alps . They have practically no glaciers . Once upon a time they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Swiss mountains , but a few square miles of glacier are all that remain . The same holds true of practically all Spanish ridges . They are steep and difficult to cross . But even the Sierra Nevada , the range of southern Andalusia , only shows a few snow caps from October till March , if that long . The direction of the mountains was of course of immediate influence upon the Spanish rivers . They all of them start on or near the barren high plateau in the center ? the remnant of a terrific prehistoric mountain-range which has worn away in the course of millions of years , and they hasten to the sea , but at such terrific speed and with , so many waterfalls that none of them possesses the slightest value as a trade-route . Furthermore , the long dry summers deprive them of most of their water , as you may see in Madrid where the sandy bottom of the Manzanares provides the children of the capital with a nice imitation sea-shore for at least five months of the year . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names of most of them . The Tagus on which Lisbon , the Portuguese capital , is situated is an exception . It is navigable almost as fai as the Spanish-Portuguese frontier . The Ebro too in northern Spain , which runs through Navarre and Catalonia , can be used by smaller vessels , but larger ones have to pass most of the way through a canal which runs parallel with the river itself . The Guadalquivir ( Wadi-el-Kebir or Big River of the Moors ) yrhkh connects Seville with the Atlantic Ocean can only be used by vessels that draw less than fifteen feet . Between Seville and Cordova , the famous Moorish capital that used to boast of no less than nine hundred public baths before the Christians captured it and reduced the population from 200,000 to 50,000 and the public baths from 900 to o , the Guadalquivir is only available for small vessels . After that it becomes what most Spanish rivers are , canyon rivers ( like our own Colorado ) which are a great hindrance to overland trade while contributing 1ractically nothing to commerce along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nature was not particularly kind to the Spaniards . The great central part of the country consisted of a high plateau , divided into halves by a low mountain ridge . Old Castile is the name of the northern half and New Castile that of the other . The dividing ridge is called the Sierra de Guadarrama . The name Castile , which merely means " castle " , is a very pretty name . But it resembles those boxes of Spanish cigars of which the label is so much more imposing than the quality of the contents . For Castile is as harsh and ill-favored a land as may be found anywhere . When General Sherman , after his march through Georgia , remarked that henceforth a crow wishing to cross the Shenandoah Valley would have to pack his own rations , he was consciously or unconsciously quoting a remark which the Romans made 2000 years before when they said that a nightingale trying to cross Castile would have to take its food and drink with it or it would die of hunger and thirst . For the mountains which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that arise from the Atlantic and the Mediterranean from reaching this unfortunate table-land . As a result , Castile suffers from nine months of inferno and during the other three months of the year it is exposed to the cold and dry winds which sweep across this treeless tract with such a merciless fury that sheep are the only animals that can live here with any degree of comfort , while the only plant that prospers is a variety of grass , the esparto or halfa grass , which is very tough and can therefore be used for basket-work . But most of this table-land , called the meseta by the Spaniards ( a word which you meet again in our own " mesas " , familiar to all those who know New Mexico or follow the adventures of Krazy Kat ) , is something that closely resembles a plain , ordinary desert , and that makes you understand why Spain and Portugal , although much larger than England , have only half the population of the British Isles . For further particulars about the shabby poverty of these regions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miguel de a3o VAN LOON 'S GEOGRAPHY Cervantes Saavedra . You may remember that the " ingenious hidalgo " who was his hero bore the proud name of Don Quixote de la Mancha . Well , Mancha was one of those inland deserts with which the plateau of Castile was dotted then as it is now , a bleak , inhospitable stretch of waste land near Toledo , the ancient Spanish capital . The name itself was ominous to Spanish ears , for in the original Arabic , al mansha , it meant " wilderness " and the poor Don was really the " Lord of the Wilderness " . In a country like that , where Nature is both stingy and obstinate , Man must either settle down to hard labor and force her to yield him the necessities of life , or he can choose to live as the average Spaniard lives , who as a rule can load all the family possessions on the back of one very small donkey . And that brings us to one of the greatest tragedies that ever occurred as a result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , the country belonged to the Moors . It was not the first time the Iberian peninsula had been invaded . For the country possessed valuable mineral deposits . Two thousand years ago copper , zinc and silver were what petroleum is today . Wherever copper , zinc and silver were to be found , rival armies would fight for their possession . When the Mediterranean was divided into two great armed camps and when the Semites ( of Carthage , a colony of the Phoenicians and ruthless in its exploitation of subject nations ) and the Romans ( not of Semitic origin but quite as ruthless in their exploitation of subject nations ) were throwing loaded dice ( one of the chief early uses made of lead was for the purpose of loading dice ) for the treasures of the world , Spain could not long escape her fate . Like many a modern land , unfortunately blessed with natural riches , Spain was turned into a battleground for the mercenaries of two large groups of organized brigands . As soon as they were gone , the country was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern Europe , trying to break into Africa . And then , early during the seventh century , a camel driver in Arabia had a vision and started a number of desert tribes of SPAIN iii whom no one had ever heard , on the war-path , bound for world-domination . A century later , they had conquered all of northern Africa and were ready to tackle Europe . In the year 711 Tarik sailed for the famous Monkey Rock ( the only spot in Europe where monkeys continued to live in a wild state ) and without meeting any opposition landed his troops near Gibraltar , the famous rock ( which incidentally does not look like the well-known advertisement because it turns its back upon the land and not upon the sea ) which during the last two hundred years has belonged to England . Thereafter the old Pillars of Hercules , the straits which Hercules had dug by the simple process of pushing the moun-tains of Europe and Africa aside , belonged to the Moham-medans . Could the Spaniards have defended themselves successfully against this invasion ? They tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerted action , for the mountain-ranges which ran a parallel course and the rivers with their deep canyons divided the country into a number of independent little squares . Remember that even today some five thousand Spanish villages have no direct communication with each other or any other part of the world , except by a narrow track which pedes-trians , free from dizziness , may use during certain parts of the year . And then remember one of the few definite facts which his-tory and geography teach us , that such countries are breeding places for clannishness . Now clannishness has undoubtedly cer-tain good qualities . It makes the members of the same clan loyal to each other and loyal to the common or clan interests . But Scotland and the Scandinavian peninsula are there to show us that clannishness is the deadly enemy of all forms of eco-nomic cooperation and national organization . Island dwellers are supposed to be " insular " and to care for nothing except the affairs of their own little islet . But they at least can sit themselves down in a boat once in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or rescue the crew of a ship-wrecked vessel and hear // what the big world is doing . The man of the valley , shut off from the rest of humanity by an almost unsurpassable mountain ridge , has no one but himself and his neighbors and they in turn have no one but themselves and their neighbors . The conquest of Spain by the Mohammedans was possible because the Moors , although a desert people and therefore great worshippers of the restricted " tribal " idea , were for once united under strong leaders who had given them a common national purpose which made them forget their own petty ambitions . While the Spanish clans fought each one for itself and hated their rival clans as cordially ( and often more so ) than they hated the common enemy who was driving them out of house and home , the Mohammedans obeyed a single head . The seven centuries during which the great Spanish war of liberation lasted are an endless recital of treachery and rivalry between the little Christian states of the north that survived because the Pyrenees formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without getting into trouble with the French , who , after a few vague gestures on the part of Charlemagne , had left them completely to their own fate . Meanwhile the Moors had turned southern Spain into a veritable garden . These desert people appreciated the value of water , and they loved the flowers and trees which were so sadly lacking in their own part of the world . They constructed vast irrigation works and imported the orange , the date , the almond tree , sugar-cane and cotton . They set the Guadalquivir to work to turn the valley between Cordova and Seville into one vast " huerta " or garden where the farmer was able to reap as many as four harvests every year . They tapped the Jucar River which flows into the Mediterranean near Valencia and added another I20o square miles of fertile land to their possessions . They imported engineers , built universities where agriculture was scientifically studied , and constructed about the only roads the country possesses to this very day . What they did for the progress of astronomy and mathematics we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And they were the only people in the Europe 4 // of that day who paid the slightest attention to medicine and hygiene , carrying their tolerance in such matters so far that they reintroduced the works of the ancient Greeks into the west by means of their own Arabic translations . And they set another force to work which was to be of tremendous value to them . Instead of shutting the Jews up in ghettos or worse , they gave them free rein to develop their great commercial and organizing power for the benefit of the country at large . And then the inevitable happened . Almost the whole of the country had been conquered , and there was little danger from the side of the Christians . Other Arab and Berber tribes , thirsting i their miserable deserts , heard news of this terrestrial Paradise . And since Mohammedan rule was autocratic , the success or failure of that rule depended upon the ability of a single person . Amidst these luxurious surroundings , dynasties founded by strong-armed plow-boys degenerated and became weak . Other strong-armed plow-boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the joys of the Alhambra of Granada and the Alcazar of Seville . There were civil wars . There was murder . Whole families were wiped out . Others pushed to the front . Meanwhile in the north , the strong man had made his appearance . Clans were being combined into tiny principalities . Tiny principalities were being combined into small states . Men began to hear the names of Castile and Leon and Aragon and Navarre . Finally they forgot their ancient rivalries long enough to marry Ferdinand of Aragon with Isabel of Castile , the land of the castles . During this great war of liberation over three thousand pitched battles were fought . The Church turned the " racial " struggle into a conflict of religious aspirations . The Spaniard became the soldier of the Cross ? a most noble ambition which was to bring ruin to the country for which he so valiantly fought . For in the same year that the last of the Moorish strongholds , Granada , was taken from the Moors , Columbus discovered the road to America . Six years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the direct route to the Indies . Therefore , just at the mo134 VAN LOON 'S GEOGRAPHY ment when the Spaniard should have taken possession of his own home and should have continued to develop those latent natural forces of his country which had been set into motion by the Moors , he came into easy money . His religious feeling of exaltation made it easy for him to imagine himself a holy missionary when in reality he was nothing but an uncommon ( because uncommonly brutal and greedy ) brigand . In 1519 he conquered Mexico . In 1532 he conquered Peru . After that , he was lost . All further ambitions were drowned in the steady flow of gold which the cumbersome galleons dumped into the storehouses of Seville and Cadiz . No man would disgrace himself working with his hands when he could belong to the " gold collar class " by demanding his share of the Aztec and Inca plunder . All the painful work of the Moors became undone . The Moors themselves were forced to leave the country . Next the Jews went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked and deprived of all their possessions , wherever it pleased the captain of the ship to put them on land . Their hearts filled with revenge but their minds sharpened by their sufferings , they struck back at their tormentors , had a hand in every heretical enterprise that was directed against the hated name of Spain . But even Providence must take a hand and give these unfortunate sufferers of the Golden Illusion a monarch whose view of life did not extend beyond the cloistered cell he erected for himself in the palace of the Escurial , situated on the outskirts of the bleak Castilian plain , to which he had transferred his new capital city of Madrid . Henceforth the riches of three continents and the man-power of an entire nation were to be used to curb the aggressions of the unbelievers , the Protestants of the north , the Mohammedans of the south . The Spanish people , changed by seven centuries of religious warfare into a race in whose eyes the supernatural had become the natural , willingly obeyed their royal master . And they bled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by growing too rich . The Iberian peninsula made the Spanish people what they // are today . Can the Spanish people now turn around and after centuries of neglect change the Iberian peninsula into what they want it to be , regardless of the past and with only an eye to the future ? They are trying and in some cities , like Barcelona , they are trying very hard . But what a job ! What a job ! XI FRANCE , THE COUNTRY THAT HAS EVERYTHING IT WANTS WE OFTEN hear it said that France does not consider herself a part of the rest of the world , that the French people , who live on a continent , are infinitely more " insular " than their English neighbors who dwell in rainy solitude on an island , in short , that the French , by their persistent and systematic refusal to take any interest , however slight , in the affairs of this planet , are the most selfish and self-centered of all nations and are at the bottom of most of our present troubles . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go down to their roots . The roots of any given people are situated deep down in the soil and in the soul . The soil has influenced the soul and the soul has influenced the soil . We can not understand the one without understanding the other . But when we have grasped the true inner meaning of both , we have a key to the character of almost any nation . Most of the accusations we hear so often uttered against the French are based upon the truth . But so was that unbounded and unquestioning praise heaped upon them during the days of the Great War , for both their virtues and their defects grew directly out of the geographic position of their country . It had made them self-centered and self-contented , because the land they occupied between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean was absolutely self-sufficient for their needs . Why go abroad for changes of climate or changes in scenery when you can find all of those in your own backyard ? Why travel all over the globe to study differences of language and habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry you from the 136 // twentieth to the twelfth century or from a smiling , verdant country of castles to the magnificent mysteries of a land of sanddunes and solemn pine trees ? Why bother about passports or letters of credit and bad food and sour wine and the dull , stodgy faces of frozen northern peasants when your own food and drink and beds and conversation are about as good as any this vale of tears can provide , when you live in a land where ( believe it or not ! ) they can make spinach a dish fit for human consumption ? Of course a poor Swiss , who has never seen anything except a mountain , or a poor Dutchman , who has never seen anything except a flat piece of green meadow with a few black and white cows , must go abroad once in a while or he would die of boredom . A German will sooner or later tire of his exclusive diet of excellent music interspersed with indifferent sausage-sandwiches .

But the Frenchman , lucky devil , lives in an earthly paradise where all things are to be had by all men without a change of cars and therefore he will ask you , " Why should I ever stir from my own country ? " You may answer that this is a hopelessly one-sided point of view and that my Frenchman is all wrong . I wish that I could agree with you but I am forced to admit that France in many respects is a country singularly blessed by Nature and its general geographical background . In the first place , France has every sort of a climate . It has a temperate climate . It has a hot climate . It has a medium climate . France is the proud possessor of the highest mountain in Europe . At the same time the French have been able to connect all the industrial centers of their land with canals that run through absolutely flat country . If a Frenchman likes to spend his winter sliding down the slopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Savoy in the western branch of the Alps .

Sooner or later , every man , woman or child who ever made the front page of the world 's news-sheets will pass that corner . And what is more , they will pass that corner without attracting any // particular attention , for this procession has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an emperor or even the highest dignitary of the Church causes about as much commotion as a freshman on a college campus . Right here we come upon one of the unanswerable mysteries of political geography . Two thousand years ago most of the territory that flies the Republican tricolor ( and flies it day and night , for the French , once they have hoisted a flag , never pull it down until time and the weather have reduced it to unrecognizable shreds ) was part of the great western European plain and there was no earthly ( that is to say , geographic ) reason why some day all the land between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean should become one of the most highly centralized nations of the world . There is a school of geography which holds that climate and geographical background play the decisive part in shaping human destinies . Undoubtedly they do sometimes . Quite as often it is the other way around . The Moors and the Spaniards lived on the same soil and the sun shone with equal violence upon the valley of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 1 600 . But in the year r Zoo it bestowed its blessings upon a paradise of fruit and flowers and in the year i 600 it forced its accursed rays upon a parched wilderness of neglected irrigation ditches and weeds . The Swiss speak four languages , yet feel themselves to be members of one single nation . The Belgians speak only two and hate each other to the point where the desecration of each other 's soldiers ' graves has become a regular Sunday afternoon pastime The Icelanders on their little island maintained their independence and self-government for over a thousand years against all corners , and the Irish on their island hardly ever know a moment of independence . And so it goes . Human nature , regardless of the advance of the machine and of science and of standardization of every sort , will always remain an extremely unstable and undependable factor in the general scheme of zoo VAN LOON 'S GEOGRAPHY things . It has been responsible for the many strange and unexpected developments of which the map of the world is the living evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which bears me out on this point . Politically speaking , France seems to be one country . But if you will kindly look at the map you will notice that France is really composed of two separate parts which actually turn their backs upon each other ? the valley of the Rhone in the southeast which looks out upon the Mediterranean and the great inclined plain of the north and the west which faces towards the Atlantic . Let us begin with the oldest of these two halves . The Rhone takes its origin in Switzerland but it really does not become a river of any importance until it has left the Lake of Geneva and has reached the city of Lyons , the center of the French silk industry , where it combines with the Saone , a river which comes down from the north and which has its source only a few miles from that of the Meuse , a river which is as intimately connected with the history of northern Europe as the Saone ( combined with the Rhone ) is with that of the south . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it reaches the Gulf of the Lion ( no , the name Gulf of Lyons which appears on many maps is an error ) it has come down some 6000 feet , which accounts for its rapid currents which have not yet been entirely overcome by the modern steamer . Nevertheless it offered the ancient Phoenicians and Greeks a convenient entrance way into the heart of Europe , for manpower ? slave-power ? was cheap . The ships could be dragged upstream by these prehistoric Volga boatmen ( their fate can not have been much happier than that of their Russian colleagues ) and downstream was a matter of a few days . And so it happened that the old civilization of the Mediterranean made its first attack upon the European hinterland by way of the Rhone valley . Strangely enough Marseilles , the earliest commercial settlement in that region ( and still the most important French port on the Mediterranean ) was not situated directly at // the mouth of the river but several miles towards the east . ( It is now connected with the Rhone by means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice , for Marseilles became such an important center of trade that as early as the third century before Christ Marseillian coins had found their way as far as the Austrian Tyrol and the region around Paris . And soon the whole region immediately to the north of it recognized Marseilles as its capital . Then , during an ill-fated moment in its history , the citizens of the town , hard pressed by wild tribes from the Alps , asked the Romans to come and help them . The Romans came and , as was their habit , stayed . All the land along the mouth of the Rhone became a Roman " provincia " and the name " Provence " , which has played such a great role in history , bears silent testimony to the fact that it was the Romans , rather than the Phoenicians and Greeks , who recognized the importance of this fertile triangle . But here we find ourselves face to face with one of the most perplexing problems both of geography and history . The Provence with its mixture of Greek and Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its front door opening upon the Mediterranean and its back door leading conveniently to the plain of central and northern Europe , seemed predestined to become the logical successor to Rome . It was given every possible natural advantage and then , with all the trump cards in its hands , it failed to play them . During the quarrels between Caesar and Pompey , the Provence took the side of Pompey and the rival gang destroyed the city of Marseilles . But that was a minor incident , for soon afterwards its citizens were doing business once more at the same old stand , while literature and courtly manners and the arts and sciences , no longer safe in Rome , fled across the Ligurian Sea and turned the Provence into an island of civilization entirely surrounded by barbarians . When the Popes with all their wealth and power were no longer able to maintain themselves in the city of the Tiber ( the Roman mob of the Middle Ages was little better than a pack of // wolves and as relentless as our own gangsters ) they tea moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first attempt at bridge-building on a large scale ( most of the bridge now lies on the bottom of the river , but in the twelfth century it was one of the world 's wonders ) and where they owned a castle that could withstand a hundred sieges . Thereupon , for almost an entire century the Provence was the home of the head of Christendom , its knights took a very prominent part in the Crusades and one noble Provencal family became the hereditary ruler of Constantinople . But somehow or other the Provence was never able to play the role for which Nature seemed to have predestined her when she created these delightful and fertile and romantic valleys . The Provence gave us the Troubadours , but even they , although recognized as the founders of that form of literature which has maintained itself ever since in our novels and our plays and our poetry , were never able to make their soft Provencal dialect , the langue d'oc , the general tongue of all France . It was the north with its langue d'oil ( oil and oc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the north , which enjoyed none of the natural advantages of the south , which was to found the French state , create the French nation and bestow upon the world in general the manifold blessings of French culture . But sixteen centuries ago , no one could have foreseen this development . For then the entire plain which reaches from the Pyrenees in the south to the Baltic in the north seemed predestined to become part of a vast Teutonic empire . That would have been the natural development . But man not being very much interested in natural developments , everything came differently . To the Romans of Caesar 's time , all this part of Europe had been the Far West . They had called it Gallia because it was inhabited by Gauls , by people belonging to the mysterious race of fair-haired men and women to whom the Greeks had given the general name of Keltoi or Celts . And in those days , there were two kinds of Gaul . One was the region of the Po River , between // the Alps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance at a very early date and which was known as Gallia Cisalpina or **31;277;TOOLONG . That was the Gaul which Caesar left when he threw his famous dice and boldly crossed the Rubicon . Then there was the Gallia Transalpina , the **25;310;TOOLONG , and that accounted vaguely for all the rest of Europe . But after Caesar 's famous expedition of the years 58-51 B. C. , it came to be associated more particularly with the France of today . It was a fertile land which could be made to pay taxes without too much objection on the part of the natives , hence an ideal domain for intensive Roman colonization . The passes between the Vosges Mountains in the north and the Jura in the south offered no great difficulties to the progress of an army consisting mostly of infantry . Soon the great plain of France was dotted with Roman fortresses and Roman villages , markets , temples , jails , theaters and factories . A small island in the river Seine , where the Celts still lived on houses built on poles , and called Lutetia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken possession of this natural fortress ) became an ideal spot on which to build a temple dedicated to Jupiter . That temple stood where Notre Dame arises today . As the island had direct water communication with Great Britain ( a most profitable Roman colony during the first 400 years of our era ) and was an excellent strategic center from which to watch the turbulent regions between the Rhine and the Meuse , it quite naturally developed into the chief center of the vast Roman organization that administered the Far West . As I told you in the chapter on maps , we sometimes wonder how the Romans were able to find their way across the whole island and mainland world of that day , but there can be no question about it ? they had an unerring instinct for the right spot , whether they were building a harbor , a fortress or a tradingpost . A casual observer , after passing six dreary weeks amidst the rains and fogs of the Parisian valley , may ask himself , " Why in the name of Mars did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration headquarters for all their western and northern possessions ? " But a geologist with a map of northern France before him could show us . Millions of years ago , when all this territory was being tortured by incessant earthquakes , and when mountains and valleys were thrown hither and yon as casually as the chips on a gaming table , four heavy layers of rock of different ages were tossed about in such a way that they came to lie on top of each other , like the saucers of one of those Chinese tea-sets which used to delight the hearts of our grandmothers . The lowest and biggest of these saucers stretches from the Vosges Mountains to Brittany , where its western brim lies buried beneath the waters of // the British Channel . The second one reaches from Lorraine to the coast of Normandy . The third one , the famous Champagne region , encircles the fourth one , appropriately called the Ile de France , or the Island of France . This " island " is a vague circle bounded by the Seine , the Marne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situated right in the heart of it . That meant safety ? almost complete safety ? because it offered the greatest amount of protection from foreign invasion . For the enemy was obliged to storm the steep outer edges of those saucers while the home troops were not only in an excellent position for defence but in case of defeat could leisurely withdraw to the protection of the next saucer-rim and could repeat that performance four times ere they had reached their little island in the Seine , which , by the burning of the few connecting bridges , could be turned into an impregnable fortress . It was of course possible for a very determined and wellequipped hostile force to take Paris . But it was exceedingly difficult , as the Great War has shown us only recently . It was not only the valor of the French and English that kept the Germans out of the French capital . It also was that geographical accident of millions of years ago which had put every possible natural barrier in the way of the invaders from the east . France has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independence . But whereas most countries have been under the necessity of guarding four separate frontiers , France was able to devote all her energies to the protection of her western boundaries ; and this probably accounted for the fact that France could develop into a highly centralized modern state long before any of the other nations of Europe . The whole of the western part of France , situated between the Cevennes and the Vosges and the Atlantic falls quite naturally into a number of peninsulas and valleys which are separated from each other by low mountain ridges . The most western of these valleys is that of the Seine and Oise which is connected with the plains of Belgium through a natural gateway defended since time immemorial by the city of St. Quentin . In modern // times it has become a very important railroad center and as such it was one of the main German objectives during the march on Paris in 1914 . The valley of the Seine and that of the Loire are in easy communication with each other by way of the gap of Orleans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play a very important role in the history of France . The national heroine of the French is known as the Maid of Orleans , and the biggest railroad station in Paris is called the Gare d'Orleans , and it was the geographical position of that city on that pass between the north and the south which was responsible for both names . In the Middle Ages , knights in armor fought for such key positions . Today railroad companies fight for such key positions . The world changes . But often enough , the more it seems to change , the more it really remains the same . As for the connection between the Loire valley and the valley of the Garonne , it followed the present railroad line via Poitiers , and it was near Poitiers that Charles Martel in the year 732 prevented the Moors from pushing any further into Europe , and it was near Poitiers that the Black Prince in the year 1356 se completely annihilated the French forces that France remained under English domination for almost another hundred years . As for that wide valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that famous land of Gascony whence came the dashing d'Artagnan and the noble King Henry IV , that part of France is in direct communication with the Provence and the Rhone valley by way of a valley that runs from Toulouse on the Garonne River to Narbonne , which used to be on the Mediterranean and which incidentally was the oldest of all Roman settlements in Gaul . Like all such prehistoric highways ( for that route was used thousands of years before the beginning of written history ) it has always been a source of revenue to some one . Racketeering and profiteering are as old as the human race . If you doubt this statement , go to any mountain pass in any part of the world and remain in that neighborhood until you have definitely located // the spot where the road was at its narrowest a thousand years ago . On that exact spot you will find the ruins of from half a dozen to two dozen castles and if you know anything about ancient civilizations , the different layers of stone will tell you : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 600 and in Boo and in 1100 and in 1250 and in 1350 and in 1500 some robber baron built himself a fortress which allowed him to demand tribute from all passing caravans . " Sometimes you will be surprised to find a flourishing city in , stead of a mere ruin . But the towers and ravelins and counterscarps and bastions of Carcassonne will tell you how terribly strong such a mountain pass fortress had to be to survive the attacks of all its hungry enemies . So much for the general landscape of France . Now let me add a few very general characteristics about the people who live in this land between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic . There is one thing they seem to have in common , a certain sense of balance and proportion . I would almost feel inclined to say that the French tried hard to be " logical " , if that unfortunate word were not so closely connected with the idea of something dry and dull and pedantic . It is true that France is the home of the highest mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French territory , but that is merely an accident . The average Frenchman is as little concerned about that waste of snow and ice as the average American is about the Painted Desert . What he likes best is the harmonious roll of the hills of the Meuse region and Guyenne and Normandy and Picardy , the pleasant little rivers with their high poplars and their leisurely barges , the haze that hangs over the valleys at night and then turns them into paintings by Watteau . What he knows best are those little villages where nothing ever changes ( the greatest strength of any country ) , those small towns in which the people live or at least try to live as their ancestors did fifty or five hundred years ago , and Paris , where // the best living and the best thinking have gone hand in hand for more than ten centuries . For the Frenchman , contrary to the absurd fables foisted upon us during the Great War , is not a sentimental dreamer , but a most intelligent and eager realist . He stands with both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will live but once and that threescore and ten is all he can expect . And so he endeavors to make himself as comfortable as possible while on this planet and wastes no time imagining the world better than it is . C'est la vie ? such is life ? and suppose we make the best of it ! Since food is agreeable to civilized man , let us provide even the poorest with the knowledge of good cooking . Since wine , ever since the days of our Savior , has been regarded as a fit drink for true Christians , let us cultivate the best of wines . Since the Lord in iso VAN LOON 'S GEOGRAPHY his wisdom has seen fit to fill this earth with many things agreeable to the eye and the ear and the nose , let us not indulge in a haughty denial of these divine bounties but partake of them as an all-wise Providence has evidently meant us to do . And since Man is stronger when fighting in a group than when acting alone , let us stick closely to the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weal and woe of all its members just as all the individual members are responsible for the weal and woe of the family . This is the ideal side of French life . There is another side , much less agreeable , which however grows directly out of the very qualities which I have just enumerated . The family quite frequently ceases to be a pleasant dream and becomes a nightmare . The endless grandmothers and grandfathers who rule the clan act as a brake which prevents all progress . The excellent habit of saving for sons and grandsons and great-grandsons degenerates into a hideous habit of scraping and filching and rook ing and pinching and economizing on every necessity of life , including that charity towards one 's neighbor without which civilized existence becomes a very drab experience indeed . But by and large the average Frenchman , of however humble rank or station , seems to carry with him a certain practical philosophy of life which provides him with a maximum of content at a minimum of expenditure . For one thing , he is not ambitious in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are born unequal . They tell him that in America every boy may some day hope to become president of the bank for which he works as a clerk . What of it ? He does not want to assume all that responsibility ! What would become of his three hours for luncheon ? It would of course be nice to have all the money that goes with the job , but the sacrifice of comfort and happiness would be too great . And so the Frenchman works and works industriously and his wife works and his daughters and his sons work too , yes , the whole country works and saves and lives the sort of lives it likes to live and does not try to lead the sort of lives other people think they ought to like to live ; and that is a bit of wis- // dom which does not make for great riches , but which is a better guarantee for ultimate happiness than the doctrine of success preached all over the rest of the world . Whenever we come to the sea in this geography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the coast indulge in fishing . Of course they do . What else would you expect them to do ? Milk cows or dig for coal ? But when we reach the subject connected with agriculture , we shall make a very curious discovery . Whereas in most countries the population during the last hundred years has been attracted to the cities , fully sixty percent of all Frenchmen continue to live in the country ; and France today is the only country in Europe which could withstand a prolonged siege without importing grain from abroad . The ancestral methods of working the fields are gradually making way before the improved methods of modern science and when the French peasant shall have ceased to till his soil as his great-great-grandfather did in the days of Charlemagne and Clovis , France will be entirely self-supporting . What helps to keep the peasant on the land is the fact that as a rule he is his own proprietor . His farm may not be much of a farm but it is his own . In England and in east Prussia , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal of agriculture , the farms belong to some vague and distant landlord . But the French Revolution did away with the landlord , whether noble or cleric , and divided his property among the small peasantry . That was often very hard on the former proprietors . But their ancestors had acquired those possessions by right of eminent plunder , so what was the difference ? And it has proved of tremendous advantage to the country at large . For it gives more than half of the people a direct interest in the welfare of the whole nation . Like everything else , that state of affairs probably has its disadvantages . It may account for the exaggerated feeling of nationalism among the French . It may explain the provincialism which makes every Frenchman stick to the people of his own village even when he moves to Paris , so that Paris is full of little hotels // catering to certain groups of regional travellers , a situation which we could only duplicate if New York had hostelries patronized exclusively by Chicagoans or Kalamazooians or Fresnonians or people from Horsehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to migrate to other parts of the world , but then again , why should any one move to another country when he is perfectly happy at home ? Next to agriculture , the cultivation of the wine-grape keeps vast numbers of Frenchmen attached to the soil . The entire valley of the Garonne is devoted to vine culture . The city of Bordeaux near the mouth of the Garonne and just north of those vast silty plains called the Landes , where the shepherds walk on stilts and the sheep can remain out of doors all the year long , is the center for the export of this wine , as Cette , on the Mediterranean , is the harbor for the famous wines of the piping hot valley of the Rhone . The wines from Burgundy ? the so-called Cote d'Or ? are gathered together in Di j on , while those of the Champagne are assembled ( and multiplied and divided ) in the ancient French coronation city of Rheims . When grain and wine fail to support the population , industry helps out . The ancient French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects and wasted . useless millions on the pretty ladies of Versailles . They made . their courts the center of fashion and civilized living towards which all the world flocked to learn agreeable manners and to be taught the difference between eating and dining .. As a result , , even today , a century and a half after the last of the ancient rulers was thrown into the quick-lime of a Paris potter's-field , with his head between his feet , Paris dictates unto the rest of the world what to wear and how to wear it . The industries which provide Europe and America with those indispensable luxuries . which most people prefer to the sheer necessities , are centered in and around the Ile de France and they provide employment to millions of women and girls . The endless flower fields of the . Riviera are the original source whence flows most of our per // fumery at six and ten dollars a bottle ( a very small bottle , too , but that is the result of our wise decision to tax all those things which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovery of coal and iron in the soil of France , and Picardy and Artois grew drab and ugly with those vast dump-heaps of cinders and slag which played such a great part during the battle of Mons , where the English tried to stop the Germans in their march upon Paris . Lorraine became the center for the iron industry . The central plateau fabricated steel . When the war was over , the French hastened to annex the Alsace which provided them with more steel and which , during the last fifty years of German domination , had gone in heavily for textiles . As a result of this recent development , one-quarter of the French people are today engaged in industries , and they can proudly boast that their industrial cities are fully as hideous , as unattractive and as inhuman in their outer aspect as those of England or of our own country . XII BELGIUM , A COUNTRY CREATED BY SCRAPS OF PAPER AND RICH IN EVERYTHING EXCEPT INTERNAL HARMONY THE modern kingdom of the Belgians consists of three parts : the plain of Flanders along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Flanders and the mountains of the east , rich in iron and coal , and the Ardennes Mountains of the east , through which the Meuse flows in pleasant curves , bound for the marshes of the Low Countries a short distance further towards the north . The iron and coal deposits centering around the cities of Liege , Charleroi and Mons ( the great war for Democracy had a strange habit of bringing the names of coal and iron cities to the front pages of our newspapers ) are so plentiful that Belgium will probably be able to provide the world with those two necessities of modern life long after the coal fields and iron beds of Germany , France and England shall have been exhausted . But this country , blessed with what the Germans so often call the " heavy industry " , has curiously enough no good modern harbors of its own . The coast along the Channel , shallow and protected by a most complicated arrangement of sand banks and shallow places , has no ports worthy of the name . The Belgians have dug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antwerp , her most important harbor , lies forty miles distant from the North Sea , and the river Scheldt for the last thirty miles of its course runs through Dutch territory , a slightly absurd arrangement and one which might be called " unnatural " from a geographic point of view but unavoidable in a world ruled by scraps of paper signed by the delegates to solemn international conferences . As however Belgium is a country that 154 // was the direct outcome of a number of such conferences , we ought to know something about the historical antecedents that faced their Excellencies whenever they settled comfortably around their green tables to decide the fate of the world . The Gallica Belgica of the Romans had been inhabited by Celts ( the same people as the original settlers of Britain and France ) and a number of small Germanic tribes . All of these were forced to recognize the suzerainty of the Romans who pushed forward in a northern direction across the plains of Flanders and over the hills of the Ardennes until they reached the almost impassable marshes which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Netherlands . Next it was a minor province of the empire of Charlemagne . Next , by the disastrous treaty of Verdun of 843 it was made part of the central kingdom of Lothair . Next it was divided into a large number of semi-independent duchies and counties and bishoprics . Next , the Habsburgs , the most competent real estate manipulators of the Middle Ages , got hold of it . But the Habsburgs were not looking for coal and iron . They were looking for safe returns on farm land and for quick returns on trade . Hence the eastern part of the country ( and by far the most important ) was regarded as a semi-wilderness . But Flanders was given every opportunity to develop its latent forces and did so , until during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries of our era it was by far the richest part of northern Europe . This was due to a fortunate geographic position which allowed medieval ships of moderate size to penetrate far inland and to the fact that the early rulers of Flanders were men and women of quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other feudal chieftains stuck closely to agriculture and despised capitalism as heartily as the Church despised the idea of taking interest on loans . In consequence of this very wise policy , Bruges and Ghent and Ypres and Cambrai waved fat and rich and opulent , doing the work that other countries should have performed for themselves if their sovereigns had allowed them to grasp their opt56 VAN LOON 'S GEOGRAPHY portunities . The subsequent downfall of these early centers of capitalistic industries was brought about by a combination of geography and human ? all too human ? characteristics . Geography did its share by changing certain currents in the North Sea which filled the harbors of Bruges and Ghent with such vast and unexpected masses of sand that those cities became completely landlocked . While the labor unions ( the guilds ) which in the beginning had been a source of tremendous strength , rapidly degenerated into tyrannical and short-sighted organizations , founded for no other purpose than to slow up and impede every known form of industrial activity . BELGIUM As the old native dynasties had died out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no one to intervene and the tides and the walking-delegates between them reduced Flanders to a somnolent region of pleasant little whitewashed farms and beautiful ruins which inspire old English ladies to some of their most atrocious water-colors but where the grass has never ceased to grow between the well polished cobble-stones of the ancient tenement quarters . The Reformation did the rest . For Flanders after a short and very sharp upheaval in favor of the Lutheran doctrines remained faithful to the Mother Church . And when their northern neighbors gained their independence , Holland hastened to close the last remaining port of their old rival , and with Antwerp cut off from the rest of Europe , the whole of Belgium went into a prolonged period of hibernation , out of which it did not arise until the needs of James Watt 's hungry machines drew the world 's attention to her immense riches in natural materials . Then foreign capital hastened to the valley of the Meuse and in less than twenty years Belgium had become one of the leading industrial nations of Europe . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country ( everything west of Brussels ) came fully into its own , for although it contained only 42% of the total population it soon became by far the richest part of the whole country and the Flemings were reduced to a race of semi-conquered peasants whose language might be tolerated in the kitchen and in the stable but which should never be spoken in the parlor of a civilized household . To make matters still a little more complicated , the Congress of Vienna of 1815 which was supposed to settle the peace of the world for all time ( a sort of Versailles of a century ago ) had seen fit to make Belgium and Holland into a single kingdom , so as to have a powerful northern balance against the French . The end of this strange political marriage came in the year 1830 when the Belgians arose against the Dutch , and the French ( as was to be expected ) rushed to their assistance . The Great Nations ( a little late as usual ) interfered . A prince of the house // of Coburg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious gentleman who exercised a very profound influence upon his dear little niece ) was made King of the Belgians . He had just refused a similar offer from the side of the Greeks and never had any reason to regret his choice . For the new kingdom proved to be a success . The mouth of the Scheldt remained in Dutch hands , but Antwerp became once more one of the most important harbors of western Europe . The Great European Powers had officially proclaimed Belgium a " neutral power " . But King Leopold ( the son of the founder of the dynasty ) was much too shrewd to have any confidence in such paper keep-off-the-grass signs . He worked hard to make his country something more than a third-rate little nation , existing merely by the grace of its richer neighbors . When a certain gentleman by the name of Henry Stanley returned from the heart of Africa , Leopold prevailed upon him to come to Brussels and out of this interview grew the International Association of the Congo , which in due course of time was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern world . Today the main problem before Belgium , with its magnificent geographic situation right in the heart of the most prosperous part of northern Europe , is no longer an economic one . It is a racial one . The Flemish majority is rapidly catching up with the French minority in the matter of general education and scientific and cultural development . It is clamoring for a share in the administration of the country from which it has been kept separated ever since the founding of the independent kingdom . It insists upon absolute equality for both languages , for Flemish as well as for French . But I had better leave this subject alone . It puzzles me and I fail to see why it should be that way . The Flemings and the Walloons have a common racial origin and share almost twenty centuries of common history . Yet they live like cats and dogs . In the next chapter we shall meet the Swiss who speak four different languages , German , French , Italian and Romonsch ( a 16o VAN LOON 'S GEOGRAPHY strange Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they get along with each other without any real basic friction . There must be a reason for this but I for one am willing to confess that it surpasses my own understanding . XIII LUXEMBURG , THE HISTORICAL CURIOSITY BuT ere I talk of Switzerland I ought to mention a curious little independent principality , the name of which would hardly be known if it had not played quite an important role during the first days of the World War . Luxemburg ( the " li tzel " or " little " burg ) counts only one quarter of a million inhabitants , whose ancestors lived in this neighborhood when it was still part of the Roman province of Belgium . It was however of considerable importance during the Middle Ages on account of the strength of the capital , which was supposed to be one of the " impregnable " fortresses of the world . That same fact and the jealousy between France and Prussia as to who should own it made the Congress of Vienna of 1815 give the tiny country an independent status as a duchy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rulers to compensate them for the loss of their ancestral territories in Germany . Twice during the nineteenth century the small duchy almost caused a war between Germany and France . In order to prevent further difficulties of that sort , the fortifications were finally dismantled and Luxemburg was officially declared to be " neutral territory " ? like Belgium . When the war broke out , the Germans violated this act of neutrality , basing their decision to do so upon the geographical necessity of invading France by way of the flat plains of the north and east without trying the hopeless expedient of forcing the steep tea-cup barriers of the west . ( See France . ) Luxemburg remained in German hands until 1918 . Even now the small duchy is not actually out of danger , for the soil contains a considerable amount of iron ore . 16i XIV SWITZERLAND , THE COUNTRY OF HIGH MOUNTAINS , EXCELLENT SCHOOLS AND A UNIFIED PEOPLE WHO SPEAK FOUR DIFFERENT LANGUAGES THE Swiss are apt to call their country the Helvetian Confederation , and a rather dowdy lady , called Helvetia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the twenty-two independent little republics whose representatives gather together at the capital city of Berne to discuss the affairs of the common fatherland . Since the war , when the greater part of the country ( 70% of the people speak German , 20% speak French , 6% speak Italian and 2% speak Romonsch ) was more or less on the side of the Germans ( although maintaining a most scrupulous neutrality ) , the image of a slightly idealized young hero by the name of William Tell has somewhat tended to replace the Helvetian goddess who , I am sorry to say , was beginning to look more and more like Britannia as she was depicted by the eminent artists of the mid-Victorian period in England . This conflict of coin and stamp deities ( they are not restricted to Switzerland ; almost any country has one of these queer problems ) clearly shows the dual nature of the Swiss Republic . To the outside world , all this is of very little importance . Switzerland , to those of us who are not of Swiss origin , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these that I shall speak in the present chapter . The Alps , which stretch from the Mediterranean to the Adriatic , are almost twice as long as Great Britain and contain about the same amount of territory . Sixteen thousand square miles of this land belong to Switzerland ( Denmark is just about as large ) and of these 16,000 square miles , 12,000 are productive in some 162 // way because they are covered with forests or vineyards or small bits of pasture . Four thousand square miles are of no use to anybody because they are either covered by the water of the big lakes or form part of some picturesque precipice ; and 700 square miles are covered by glaciers . As a result , Switzerland has only 250 inhabitants per square mile , while Belgium has 655 , and Germany 347 . But Norway has only 22 per square mile , and Sweden has 35 , and the idea therefore that Switzerland is merely a sort of gigantic mountain resort , inhabited exclusively by hotelkeepers and their guests is slightly erroneous . For Switzerland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern plateau between the Alps and the Tura into one of the most prosperous industrial countries of Europe , and it has been able to do so without the help of any raw materials . It has of course a superabundance of waterpower , and furthermore it enjoys a very favorable position right in the heart of Europe , which makes it possible for the finished products of the Helvetian Republic to slide quietly but continuously into at least a dozen surrounding countries . In a previous chapter I tried to give you an idea of the origin of all such complicated masses of mountain-ridges as are represented by the Alps and the Pyrenees . I told you to take half a dozen clean handkerchiefs , unfold them and put them on top of each other and push them together and then watch the wrinkles and the creases and double-jointed circles and crumples that are the result of such a forcible concentration . The table on which you performed this geological operation was the original base or core of granite ( countless millions of years old ) across which the younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become those queerly shaped pinnacles which were given their present form and aspect by still other millions of years of incessant wind and rain and snow and ice . These enormous folds , from ten to twelve thousand feet above the plains , have gradually crumbled into a series of parallel ranges . But in the center of the country ( the village of Andermatt on the Gothard pass is the geographical center of the coun164 VAN LOON 'S GEOGRAPHY try ) they meet in a vast complex of mountains ( the so-called St. Gothard range ) which send the Rhine on its course towards the North Sea , the Rhone on its way to the Mediterranean , and which also give birth to those mountain rivers which feed the lakes of Thun , of Lucerne and Zurich in the north , and the famous Italian lakes in the south . And it is precisely in this neighborhood of glaciers and precipices and valleys , so deep that they hardly ever see the rays of the sun , in this region of avalanches and impassable mountain streams , green with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republic took its origin . As usual it was a combination of practical politics with certain geographical peculiarities of the land which gave the Swiss their first chance to make a bid for independence . For almost a thousand years the half-savage peasants of these inaccessible valleys had been left alone by all their more powerful neighbors . What was the use of hoisting the proud standard of empire when there SWITZERLAND Ioy was no plunder ? At best one could deprive these wild men of a couple of cow-hides . But they were dangerous barbarians with their aptitude for guerrilla warfare and those uncomfortable boulders that came crashing down from the hillsides and that would squash a suit of armor as if it were a piece of parchment , and so the Swiss were treated as the original settlers of the Atlantic coast treated the Indians that lived behind the Alleghenies ? they were ignored . But with the rising importance of the Papacy and the tremendous upward sweep of Italian commerce during and immediately after the Crusades , northern Europe felt a very sincere need of a more direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the St. Bernard Pass ( which necessitated a long detour by way of Lyons and the entire Rhone valley , via the lake of Geneva ) or the Brenner Pass , which meant // that one had to cross the Habsburg domains with their almost unbearable tariff rates . It was then that the peasants of the Cantons ( the name for the independent little Swiss republics or districts ) of Unterwalden , Uri and Schwyz decided to combine and each spend a little money ( Heaven knows , they did not have much ) upon the road that led from the valley of the Rhine to the valley of the Ticino River . They cut down certain parts of the rock . Whenever the rocks were too hard to be removed by means of pick-axes ( try and make a mountain road without dynamite ! ) they made narrow wooden contraptions which they hung from the side of the mountain walls to circumnavigate difficult corners ; and they built some primitive stone bridges across the Rhine , which hitherto had been impassable except by pedestrians during the height of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road that had been traced by the engineers of Charlemagne , four centuries before , but had never been completed ; and by the end of the thirteenth century a merchant with a caravan of packmules could travel from Basel to Milan by way of the St. Gothard Pass with a fair assurance that he would not lose more than two or three of his animals on account of broken legs and falling stones . As early as the year 1331 we hear of the existence of a hospice on top of the pass and although it was not opened to carriages until 182o it was soon one of the most popular routes for commerce between the south and the north . Of course the good people of Unterwalden , Uri and Schwyz allowed themselves to be paid a slight remuneration for all the trouble they had taken . This steady revenue , together with the impetus this international traffic gave to such cities as Lucerne and Zurich , gave these small peasant communities a new feeling of independence which no doubt had a great deal to do with their open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , was also originally of Swiss peasant stock , although they did not mention this fact in any of the genealogies which were preserved in their home castle of Habichtsburg ( or Hawk 's // Nest ) that stood near the spot where the river Aar flows into the Rhine . I am sorry to be quite so prosaic but it was the tangible revenue derived from a busily patronized Alpine trade-route rather than the bravery of a non-existent William Tell which was responsible for the foundation of what afterwards developed into the modern Swiss Republic . That modern Swiss Republic is a highly interesting political experiment built firmly upon one of the most efficient public-school systems of the world . The governmental machine runs so smoothly and so effectively that even Swiss citizens have to think for a moment when you ask them suddenly who happens to be their President . For their country is run by a Bundesrat ? a sort of Board of Managers ? composed of seven members , and every year they appoint a new President ( usually the Vice-President of the previous year ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year he shall belong to the German-speaking part of the country , the next year to the French-speaking part , and the third year to the Italian-speaking sub-division . This President , however , bears no resemblance whatsoever to the President of the United States of America . He is merely the temporary chairman of a Federal Executive which expresses its will through the mouths of seven individual members . The President , apart from presiding over the meetings of the federal council , is minister of foreign affairs , but his position is so inconspicuous that he has no official residence . There is no Swiss " White House " . When distinguished strangers have to be entertained , the party is given in the rooms of the foreign office , and even those parties bear more resemblance to a simple bierfest in a little mountain village than to the semi-royal receptions of the French presidents or their American colleagues . The main details of the administration are too complicated to be mentioned here but the visitor to this part of the Alps is constantly being reminded that somewhere or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch to see that things // are being done and are being done both honestly and intelligently . Take the matter of railroading , which is of course connected with innumerable difficulties . The two main arteries that connect Italy with northern Europe run straight through the heart of the Swiss Alps . The Mount Cenis tunnel connects Paris with Turin ( the ancient capital of the kingdom of Savoy ) by way of Dijon and Lyons . And the Brenner line provides a direct communication between southern Germany and Vienna , but although it crosses the Alps it does not pass through any tunnel . The Simplon line and the St. Gothard lines however are not only tunnel-borers but veritable mountain-climbers . The Gothard is the older of the two . It was begun in 1872 and finished ten years later . It took eight years to dig the tunnel which is nine and a half miles long and reaches a height of almost 4000 feet . Even more interesting than the tunnel itself are the spiral tunnels between Wassen and Goeschenen . Since the valleys were so narrow that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railroad had to do its climbing through the heart of the mountains themselves . Outside of these special tunnels there are fifty-nine other tunnels ( several of them almost a mile long ) , nine large viaducts and forty-eight bridges . The second most important transalpine road , that of the Simplon , offers us a direct route between Paris and Milan by way of Dijon , Lausanne and the valley of the Rhone as far as Brieg . It was opened for traffic in the year 1906 , exactly a century after Napoleon had finished his famous Simplon Pass road with its 250 big and 350 small bridges and its ten long tunnels , the greatest piece of road-building the world had ever seen . The Simplon road , which was much easier to construct than that of the St. Gothard , follows the slowly ascending valley of the Rhone until it reaches a spot about 2000 feet high where the tunnel begins . This tunnel is twelve and a half miles long and provided with double tracks . So is the Lotschberg tunnel ( nine miles long ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy . // Although one of the narrowest of all mountain-ranges , the so-called Pennine Alps , through which the Simplon road runs , have a climate all their own . There are no fewer than twentyone peaks of 12,000 feet or more within this small quadrangle and 140 glaciers feed the turbulent streams , which have a most annoying habit of washing away railroad bridges just a few minutes before the arrival of one of the big international express trains . That there never have been any wrecks on account of these aquatic surprise parties speaks highly for the efficiency of the Swiss railroad men . But as I have said before , in this somewhat stiff and rather bureaucratic republic , nothing much is left to chance . Life is too difficult and too dangerous to encourage the amiable philosophy of " muddling through " . Somewhere , somehow , some one is forever watching , observing , paying attention . That such a general tendency towards a rather schoolmasterish punctuality and efficiency does not make for artistic success is a well-known fact . In the line of literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Swiss have never produced anything that has travelled far beyond their own narrow confines . But then , the world is full of " artistic " nations while only a few can boast of centuries of uninterrupted political and economic growth and development . And the system suits the average Swiss and his wife . What more can we ask ? xv GERMANY , THE NATION THAT WAS FOUNDED TOO LATE MERELY for the sake of convenience I have divided the different countries of Europe into racial or cultural groups , and I have started my general discussion with those nations which still showed unmistakable evidences of having been Roman colonies ere they began an independent political existence of their own . It is true that Rome had also conquered the Balkans and that in one country at least ( Roumania ) the Latin language has survived as the national tongue . But the great Mongolian , Slavic and Turkish invasions of the Middle Ages have so completely destroyed all evidence of Roman civilization in that part of the world that it would be decidedly erroneous to include the Balkan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bid farewell to the Mediterranean range-of-influence and proceed to that other form of civilization which was of Teutonic origin and which came to be centered around the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean . There is ( I have already told you that when I spoke of France ) a vast semicircular plain which stretches all the way from the eastern Russian hills , where the Dnieper and the Dvina and the Neva and the Volga take their origin , to the Pyrenees . The southern part of that semi-circle was brought under Roman control a very short time after the Germanic tribes began their mysterious migrations towards the west . The eastern part , even then , seems to have been occupied by those nomadic Slavic masses which replenished themselves just as rapidly as they were killed off and which therefore , like the rabbits of Australia , were invincible . Thus the only part that was still available when the hungry Teutonic invaders appeared upon the scene was that big 171 // square which stretched from the Vistula on the east to the Rhine delta on the west . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long line of Roman block-houses reminded all newcomers that they were entering upon a " forbidden territory " . The western part of this region was mountainous . First there were the Ardennes and the Vosges , on the western bank of the river Rhine . Then , running due east and west , came the Black Forest , the Tyrolean Mountains , the Erz ( or Iron Ore ) Mountains ( present day Bohemia ) , the Riesengebirge , and finally the Carpathians which stretched almost as far as the Black Sea . The rivers in this territory were forced to flow due north . In order of their appearance from west to east there was first of all the Rhine , the most literary of rivers , over which people have fought and wept more copiously than over any other little mountain stream . For the Rhine is really a very modest little rivulet . The Amazon is over five times as long . The Mississippi and Missouri are six times its length , and even the Ohio , which we do not consider much of a river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is five hundred miles longer . Then comes the Weser river , with the modern city of Bremen near its mouth . Then the Elbe , which has made Hamburg what it is today . Then the Oder , which gave rise to the city of Stettin , the export harbor for the products of the town of Berlin and its industrial hinterland . Finally there is the Weichsel or Vistula , with the city of Danzig which is now a free state , ruled by a commissioner appointed by the League of Nations . Millions of years ago all this territory was covered with glaciers . When they retreated they left behind them a large , sandy waste which towards the North Sea and the Baltic degenerated into a trackless morass . Gradually these northern marshes developed a fringe of sand dunes , and these dunes reach almost all the way from the Flemish coast to Konigsberg , the old Prussian capital near the Russian frontier . As soon as these dunes had developed , the marshes began to enjoy a certain protection from the tides of the ocean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soil had been prepared for timber , the // forests appeared , those same forests which , converted into peat fields , provided our ancestors with an unlimited supply of fairly good fuel . Both the North Sea and the Baltic , which are the northern and western frontiers of this plain , bear the name of " sea " as a courtesy title . They are really shallow ponds . The average depth of the North Sea is only sixty fathoms ( a fathom is six feet ) and its greatest depth is not more than 400 fathoms . The average depth of the Baltic is about thirty-six fathoms . The average depth of the Atlantic , on the other hand , is 2170 fathoms while that of the Pacific is 2240 fathoms . These figures show you that you had better think of the North Sea and the Baltic as submerged valleys . A slight elevation of the surface of the earth would once more turn them into dry land . And now let us look at a map of the dry land of Germany . I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been more or less when human beings followed the retreating glaciers and settled down permanently in this part of the old continent . These early immigrants were savages . They lived by catching wild animals and by raising a little grain . But they were savages with a very decided sense of beauty , and as their own territory Was poor in those metals which could be used for ornaments , they had to send abroad for their gold and silver . The following statement may come as a mild shock to many of my readers but all original trade-routes are luxury routes . All early contests between the races that inhabited different parts of the world were luxury contests . The Romans learned the main outlines of the geography of northern Europe from traders who had penetrated as far as the mysterious Baltic in search of amber ? a sort of petrified resin which Roman matrons used to color their hair . The desire for that hard , concrete lump of limestone , which is sometimes found inside the body of an oyster and with which women delight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slenderness of their fingers , has been responsible for more voyages of discovery in the Pacific and in // the Indian Ocean than any other cause , including the desire of many honest people to carry the Gospel unto the heathen . The quest for ambergris , a substance found in the intestinal canals of sperm whales , and the result of what in plain English we would call a bilious attack on the part of the unfortunate whale , has driven more ships to the coasts of Brazil and Madagascar and the Moluccas than the search for herring or sardines or other forms of useful food . For ambergris could be used as a base for many perfumes that smelled deliciously of flowers and distant lands , whereas food was merely food and not half as interesting . A change in fashions which made the women of the seventeenth century wear their corsets underneath their gowns and out of sight ( twelve-course dinners were bad for the figure ) was directly responsible for most of our knowledge of the Arctic . As soon as Paris had decided that hats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the white herons to deprive them of their head plumes ( regardless of the fact that this meant the extinction of one of the loveliest and noblest birds of all creation ) penetrated further into the lagoons of our southern states than they had ever done before when they were merely in quest of their daily bread and butter . I might continue the list for almost a dozen more pages . Whatever was rare and therefore expensive has always been an object of veneration to those who , by a wasteful demonstration of their riches , hoped to impress their less fortunate neighbors . Ever since the beginning of history , luxury rather than necessity has been the real pioneer of progress along the lines of exploration . And when we study the map of prehistoric Germany carefully we can still trace the old luxury routes , for in the main they are the same as those of medieval and modern times . Take the conditions some three thousand years ago . The mountain-ridges of the south , the Harz , the Erz Mountains and the Riesengebirge were situated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stretched northwards towards the North Sea and the Baltic had long since changed from marshland into dry // land and was now thickly covered with forests . And Man , following in the wake of the glaciers , which had now retreated in the general direction of Scandinavia and Finland , had claimed this entire wilderness as his own . Among the hills of the south , the tribes which inhabited the valleys had found that it paid them to cut down their trees and sell them to the Romans who had occupied strategic positions along the Rhine and the Danube . For the rest , few of these early Teuton nomads and farmers had ever seen a Roman . One Roman expedition had tried to penetrate to the heart of their country , had been ambushed in a dark and water-logged valley and slaughtered off so completely that the experiment had never been tried again . That did not mean however that northern Germany was completely cut off from all contact with the rest of the world . The great prehistoric trade-route from west to east , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line from the Pyrenees to Paris , through the gaps of Poitiers and Tours , which I described in the chapter on France . It then skirted the Ardennes and from there followed the outskirts of the central European highlands until it reached the northern lowlands now occupied by the United Soviet Republics of Russia . On its course eastward this road was of course obliged to cross a great many rivers at td it did this wherever it could find a convenient shallow place . Just as the city of Rome grew out of a ford across the Tiber , so a number of the earliest cities of northern Germany were but the continuation of prehistoric and early historic settlements which were located on the exact spot where today we would find a filling station and a general store . Hanover and Berlin and Magdeburg and Breslau had all of them got their start that way . Leipzig , although originally it was a village in the heart of Slavic lands , was also of commercial origin , for it was there that the mineral products from the Saxon mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were assembled before they were sent down the rivers and sold to the merchants patronizing the great European highway from east to west . Of course , once this road reached the Rhine , water traffic began // to compete seriously with the caravans used for the long overland haul . Water traffic has always been much cheaper and much more convenient than land traffic , and long before Caesar caught his first glimpse of the Rhine there must have been rafts used to carry merchandise from Strassburg ( where the Rhine connected with the hinterland of Franconia , Bavaria and Wurttemberg ) to Cologne and thence to the marshes of the Low Countries and eventually to Britain . It is a far cry from Berlin to Jerusalem , but both cities obeyed the same geographical rule which insists that cities must arise wherever important trade-routes cross each other . Jerusalem was situated on the caravan route from Babylonia to Phoenicia and from Damascus to Egypt and was an important trade center long before the Jews had heard of its existence . Berlin , situated on a river where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( from Paris to Petrograd and from Hamburg to Constantinople in modern terms ) happened to meet , was bound to become a second Jerusalem . All during the Middle Ages Germany consisted of a large number of semi-independent states but until 300 years ago there was nothing to indicate that some day this western part of the great European plain would develop into the leading nation of the world . Curiously enough the modern Germany grew almost directly out of the failure of the Crusading Movement . When it became certain that no new territory was to be conquered in western Asia ( the Mohammedans had proved more than a match for the Christians ) the disinherited classes of Europe began to look for other sources of agricultural wealth . Quite naturally they thought at once of the opportunities offered by the Slavic lands situated just across the Oder and the Vistula , which were inhabited by the wild and heathenish Prussians . One of the old crusading orders moved , lock , stock and barrel , from Palestine to east Prussia and transferred its business center from Acre in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For two hundred years these knights fought the Slays and settled the i78 VAN LOON 'S GEOGRAPHY farms of their victims with imported nobles and peasants from the west . In the year 1410 they suffered a terrific defeat at the hands of the Poles in the battle of Tannenberg , the same place where in 1914 Hindenburg annihilated the Russian armies . But somehow or other the order survived even this blow and when the Reformation occurred , they were still a body of considerable importance . It so happened that at that time the order was ruled by a member of the Hohenzollern family . This particular Grand Master not only joined the Protestant cause but on the advice of Martin Luther he declared himself hereditary Duke of Prussia with Konigsberg on the Gulf of Danzig as his capital . Early in the seventeenth century this duchy was acquired by another branch of the industrious and shrewd Hohenzollern tribe which ever since the middle of the fifteenth century had been administering the sandy wastes of Brandenburg . A hundred years afterwards ( in 170I , to be precise ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something better than the rank of a mere " prince elector " and they began an agitation to get themselves recognized as kings . The emperor of the Holy Roman Empire was willing . Dog as a rule does not eat dog and the Habsburgs were glad to render some small service to their good friends the Hohenzollerns . Were n't they both members of the same club ? In 1871 , the seventh Hohenzollern King of Prussia became the first Emperor of a United Germany . Forty-seven years later , the ninth King of Prussia and the third Emperor of modern Germany was forced to leave his throne and his country and that was the end of a vast holding company which began as a bankrupt remnant of crusading orders and finished as the strongest and most efficient power of the great age of industrialism and capitalism . But now that it is all over and the last of the Hohenzollerns is chopping wood in Holland , we might as well be honest about it and confess that those ex-Tyrolean mountaineers were an astonishingly capable sort of men , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of extraordinary ability . GERMANY Y7q For remember that their original territories had possessed no natural wealth of any sort . Prussia had ever been a land of farms and forests and sand and marshes . It did not produce a single article that was fit for export , the only means for any country to get a favorable balance of trade . There was a slight change for the better when a German discovered a way by which sugar could be extracted from beets . But since cane sugar was still infinitely cheaper than beet-sugar and could be imported by the ship-load from the West Indies , all this meant very little money in the pockets of either Prussians or Brandenburgians . But when the Emperor Napoleon , after having lost his navy in the battle of Trafalgar , decided to destroy England by means of an " inverted blockade " there arose a sudden but very steady demand for the Prussian beet-sugar . At , about the same time , German chemists established the value of potash and since Prussia had large potash deposits , the country could at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Hohenzollerns , however , were always lucky . After the defeat of Napoleon , Prussia acquired the Rhine region . It was of no particular value until the industrial revolution put a premium upon the possession of coal and iron . Quite unexpectedly Prussia found herself possessed of some of the richest ore and coal fields of the entire world . And then at last the hard school of poverty of the previous five hundred years began to bear fruit . Poverty had already taught the Germans to be thorough and thrifty . It now showed them how to over-manufacture and under-sell all other nations . And when there was no longer room enough on land for the rapidly increasing number of little Teutons , they took to the sea and within less than half a century they were among the leaders of the countries which derive their revenue from the carrying trade . Hamburg and Bremen , which had been of considerable importance when the North Sea was the center of civilization ( a position it held until the discovery of America made the Atlantic the main road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatened the claim to exclusive eminence of London and the ' So VAN LOON 'S GEOGRAPHY other British ports . A large ship canal was dug from the Baltic to the North Sea , the so-called Kiel Canal , which was opened in the year 1895 . Canals also connected the Rhine and the Weser and the Oder and the Vistula and the Main and the Danube ( only partly finished ) , providing a direct aquatic route between the North Sea and the Black Sea , and Berlin was given access to the Baltic by means of a canal that ran from the capital to Stettin . Whatever human ingenuity could do to assure the majority of the people a fairly decent living wage was done , and before the Great War , the average German peasant and working man , while by no means rich , and accustomed to very strict discipline , was probably better housed and better fed and in a general way better protected against accidents and old age than any other group of people belonging to the same class anywhere else . How all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a very sad story but it does not belong in the present volume . But as a result of her defeat , Germany lost the rich industrial districts of Alsace and Lorraine . She lost all her colonies , her commercial navy and part of the province of Schleswig-Holstein , which she herself had taken away from the Danes after the war of 1864 . Several thousand miles of former Polish territory ( but thoroughly Germanized by then ) were once again separated from Prussia and returned to Poland , while a broad strip of land , following the course of the Vistula and running from Thorn to Gdynia and the Baltic , was put under Polish suzerainty , that this country might enjoy direct access to the open sea . Part of Silesia , which Frederick the Great had taken away from Austria in the eighteenth century , remained in German hands . But the more valuable mineral deposits were given to Poland , although the textile interests stayed under German control . For the rest , Germany was stripped of everything it had acquired during the previous fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among other nations which had already GERMANY 18i more than their share and no surplus population with which to settle them . Politically speaking , the Treaty of Versailles may have been an excellent document . From the point of view of applied geography , it makes one despair of the future of Europe . I am afraid that those sceptical neutrals who wanted to present Lloyd George and the late Monsieur Clemenceau with a handbook on elementary geography were not so very far wrong . XVI AUSTRIA , THE COUNTRY THAT NOBODY APPRECIATED UNTIL IT NO LONGER EXISTED THE present Republic of Austria has 6,000,000 inhabitants and 2,000,000 of these live in the capital city of Vienna . As a result of this extraordinary arrangement , the country is topheavy and the marvellous old town on the Danube ( which is a muddy gray and not at all as blue as the famous waltz might make you expect ) is slowly degenerating into a dead city where disheartened old men and women wander aimlessly among the ruins of their former glory , while the younger generation has fled abroad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicide because life at home had become intolerable . Within another hundred years the gay city of Vienna ( one of the few cities where the people seemed to be really happy , if often in a sort of childish and careless way ) , that old , important center of science and medicine and the arts , will have become a second Venice . From being a capital of an empire containing more than 50,000,000 people it has become a mere village dependent upon the tourist traffic and what little importance it retains as a port of call for the boats that carry the products of Bohemia and Bavaria to Roumania and to the Black Sea . At present the geography of the ancient Danube monarchy ( this name , by which Austria was formerly known , expressed the true nature of the country about as well as anything could do ) is extremely complicated , for it has been hacked to pieces in such an arbitrary fashion as to be almost unrecognizable . But the former dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary was a perfect example of how natural conditions will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about frontiers for a 184 // moment and look at the map of this region , which was situated almost in the very heart of the European continent , as far away from the toe of Italy 's foot as from the nose of the Danish peninsula . It was really an immense circle of flat lands and rolling territory , entirely surrounded by high mountain-ranges . On the west there were the Alps of Switzerland and the Tyrol . In the north were the Erz Mountains and the Riesengebirge ( the Giant Mountains ) of Bohemia , and the Carpathians , which formed a semi-circle sheltering the Hungarian Puszta ( or steppes ) against invasions from the side of the Slavic plains . The Danube separated the Carpathians and their southern part , the so-called Transylvanian Alps , from the Balkan Mountains , and the Dinaric Alps were the barrier that protected the plains from the raw winds of the Adriatic Sea . The people who founded this state had very imperfect maps and their theoretical knowledge of geography was quite negligible . But just as our pioneers who conquered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having consciously studied an outline of the road that carried them to their final destination , so did those medieval conquerors accumulate their vast holdings by merely doing what was " immediately practicable " without bothering themselves about the theoretical side of the problem . Such things took care of themselves . Nature provided them with certain unavoidable " consequences " and Man , whenever he is wise , quietly obeys her commands . During the first thousand years of our era , the great Hungarian plain was a veritable no-man's-land , invaded by all the tribes who followed the course of the Danube on their way from the Black Sea to the west and were without any settled form of government . Charlemagne , during his life-long warfare upon the Slavic people from the east , founded a small " mark " or frontier post , as we would call it , which being the eastern mark or " Oester Reich " ( the same word as our Austria ) gave birth to the principality that eventually was to dominate that entire part of the world . Although at times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ siege of Vienna by the Turks took place long // after Harvard University had been founded ) the little mark , firmly handled and efficiently administered , first of all by the Babenberg family and afterwards by the Habsburgs , our Swiss friends whom I mentioned a few pages ago , always came out on top . Eventually these rulers of a petty frontier state even managed to get themselves elected as Emperors of that Holy Roman Empire , which was neither Roman nor Holy nor an Empire , but merely a loose federation of all the different Germanspeaking races . They held this title until the year i 8 o6 when Napoleon threw it on the scrap-heap because he intended to put an imperial crown on his own proletarian brow . But even thereafter these not over-brilliant but tenacious Habsburgs managed to keep a finger ? and a most important finger ? in the German pie until finally in 1866 Prussia pushed them back across their own mountains and bade them stay where they belonged . Today the old Eastern Mark , reduced to the rank of a seventhrate nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better future , consists , for the greater part , of that mountainous region which is but a continuation of the Swiss Alps and which contains the remnants of those famous Tyrolean mountains which were handed over to Italy by the treaty of Versailles on the ground that once upon a time they had been part of the ancient Roman Empire . This mountainous region contains two towns of some importance , Innsbruck , where the ancient route to Italy via the Brenner Pass crosses the River Inn , and where everything reminds one of the Middle Ages , and Salzburg , the birthplace of Mozart , which is one of the most beautiful cities of Europe and which tries to keep alive today by providing the world with a few musical and theatrical performances . Neither these mountains nor those of the Bohemian plateau in the north produce anything of any value . The same can be said of the so-called Viennese basin where the Romans founded an armed camp called Vindobona ( or Vienna ) , a small settlement which gained some notoriety when the famous philosopheremperor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one AUSTRIA i8g of his many campaigns against the barbarians of the northern Germanic plains . The town , however , did not come into its own until ten centuries later , when the great migrations of the Middle Ages , also called the Crusades , made it the point of departure for all those who tried to reach the Promised Land by following the Danube rather than by entrusting themselves to the racketeering ship-owners of Genoa and Venice . In the year 12.76 it became the residence of the Habsburg family and the center of their vast domains , which eventually included all the land between the mountain-ranges enumerated a few pages back . In the year 1485 the Hungarians captured the city . In 1529 and again in 1683 the Turks laid siege to it . But the town survived all these misadventures until the beginning of the eighteenth century , when it began to disintegrate as a result of a mistaken policy which entrusted every position of any importance in the monarchy to noblemen of strictly Germanic origin . Too much power is a hard thing for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They ceased to be merely amiable and became feeble and weak . In the old dual monarchy , 47% of the people were of Slavic origin and only 25% ( or one-quarter ) were Germans , while the rest consisted of Hungarians ( 19% ) and Roumanians ( 7% ) with about 600,000 Italians ( 1.5% ) and about 1oo,000 Gypsies who stuck pretty closely to Hungary where they were treated more or less like respectable citizens . The German " masters " apparently were never able to learn the lessons which the rest of Europe was slowly beginning to take to heart . Monarchies and an aristocracy can only survive as long as they are willing to assume leadership . The moment they begin to talk about " service " instead of " leadership " , they are doomed . After the endless defeats of the Austrian armies during the Napoleonic wars , the people of Vienna got into such a state of irritation in regard to their princely and grand-ducal and baronial rulers that they practically forced them to leave the town and retire to their country estates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the rest of the land , // It was then that geography came to the assistance of the city . With the nobility out of the way , the merchants and the manufacturers could at last come into their own . Vienna , freed from its ancient fortifications ( they were so enormous that the sale of the land they covered paid for the different extensions of the town ) , rapidly developed into the most important commercial , scientific and artistic center of eastern Europe . The World War made a sudden end to both riches and glory . The country now called Austria bears practically no resemblance to the empire of which it was the head until only a few years ago . Its future is entirely behind it . It is a state in name only . The refusal of the French to let it join the German Republic was the last straw . It might just as well be put up for public sale . But who would want to buy it ? XVII DENMARK , AN OBJECT LESSON IN CERTAIN ADVANTAGES OF SMALL COUNTRIES OVER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern nations go ( it has only about three and a half million inhabitants of which 750,000 live in the capital ) that we might well pass it by , if quantity rather than quality were of any real importance in the affairs of men . But as an example of what can be made out of indifferent material by the application of intelligence combined with a sensible ideal of life ( that " moderation in all things " which the Greeks had proclaimed as the highest form of wisdom ) Denmark , as well as the other Scandinavian countries , deserves special and most honorable mention . For that country with its i 6,000 square miles and its total lack of natural resources , armies , navies , mines or mountains ( at no point does the country rise above 600 feet , which is less than half the height of the Empire State Building ) is worth a dozen other countries of infinitely greater size and more pretentions and militaristic ambitions which I could mention if I felt so inclined . The Danish people , entirely through their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have made themselves the second richest country per capita of all Europe and they have practically abolished both riches and poverty as they are known in the rest of the world , establishing instead a balance of average , moderate well-to-do-ness which is without an equal anywhere else . Denmark , as one glance at the map will show you , is composed of a peninusla and a number of islands separated from each other by wide open sounds across which the railroad trains are carried on ferries . Its climate is exceedingly unpleasant . All win-187 // ter long a strong eastern wind is apt to blow across her flat fields , bringing cold showers of rain and forcing the Danes , like the Dutch with whom they have so much in common , to spend a great deal of their time indoors , a circumstance which has contributed greatly to making them a heavy book-reading nation . In consequence thereof they are a singularly well-informed group of people who own more books per capita than any other nation . But the rain and the wind keep the pastures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat , and as a result of all this Denmark alone is able to provide the world with 30% of its butter . But whereas in most other countries the soil would be owned by rich and absentee landlords , the Danes , who are essentially democratic ( in the social and economic rather than the political sense of the word ) have never encouraged the development of those vast holdings which we have encountered in most other countries . There are today 150,000 independent farmers in Denmark who operate small farms , ranging from ten to a hundred acres , and there are only 20,000 farms larger than one hundred acres . The dairy products which are sent abroad are raised and prepared according to the most modern and scientific methods , as taught by the rural agricultural schools which are merely a continuation of the free High School system spread all over the country . The buttermilk that is left over as a by-product of the butter manufacturing is used to feed the hogs which in turn provide the entire British market with its bacon . As this trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising of grain , the Danes are obliged to import their grain . They can do this however quite easily and cheaply , as Copenhagen is only two days by steamer from Danzig , and Danzig is the old export-harbor for the vast granaries of Poland and Lithuania . Part of this grain is used for poultry-raising and millions of eggs are sent each year to those same British Isles , which for some mysterious reason have never been able to grow anything more palatable than Brussels sprouts . // In order to maintain what almost amounts to a monopoly in farm products , the Danes submit to a most rigorous state control of everything that leaves their country , thereby establishing for themselves such a reputation of absolute integrity that their trademark has come to be accepted as a guarantee of absolute purity . Like all races of Teutonic origin , the Danes are incurable gamblers , and during the last few years their ventures in banking and in stock-market speculation have cost them a tidy sum of money . But the children and the cows and the hogs remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at work once more . The only difficulties they have got to fear have to do with the rapidly increasing state of bankruptcy of most of their neighbors , making such a simple dish as ham and eggs a luxury beyond the reach of the average man . The towns on the mainland are of no importance . On the west coast of Jutland ( the name of the old peninsula from which so many of the original settlers of England came ) lies Esbjerg , which is the main export harbor for all these many agricultural products , and on the east coast lies Aarhus ( the double A is pronounced OA in Danish ) which is one of the oldest centers of Christianity in this part of the world where the people continued to worship their heroic Pagan Gods ( their Odins and Thors and Baldurs ) until only four centuries before the discovery of America . The Little Belt ( I believe there are plans now to build a bridge across it ) separates Jutland from Fyen , the first of the big Baltic islands . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies the city of Odense ( the place sacred to Odin ) where Hans Christian Andersen was born , the son of a poor and sickly shoe-maker , but one of the greatest benefactors of mankind . Then we cross the Great Belt and reach the island of Zealand , the heart of the old Danish Empire . Here at a wide bay , protected from the violence of the Baltic by the small island of Amager , the vegetable garden of the capital , lies the charming city of Copenhagen , the " Merchants ' Harbor " of the Middle Ages . // During the ninth and tenth centuries , when the Danes ruled an empire which included England and Norway and parts of Sweden , Copenhagen was merely a fishing village , and Roskilde , about fifteen miles inland , was the royal residence from which those distant domains were administered ; but today Roskilde is of no importance , while Copenhagen has gone on increasing in size and importance until now it provides entertainment for one-fifth of the entire population of the country . Copenhagen is a royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present arms when the King goes swimming or fishing or strolls forth to buy himself a package of cigarettes . But you will look in vain for any other manifestations of military grandeur . This small country , which has done some of the hardest and bitterest fighting in the days gone by , and which even as recently as the year 1864 was able to hold its own against Prussia for quite a long time , voluntarily abolished its army and navy and has replaced them by a small corps of state police to enforce whatever neutrality will survive the next outbreak of a general European conflict . That is about all there is to say about Denmark . The country peacefully goes its own way . The royal family keeps off the front page of the more sensational newspapers and while few people have three overcoats , none go without , and while only a small percentage has an automobile , every man , woman and child possesses at least a couple of bicycles , as you will know for yourself if you have ever tried to cross a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a world devoted to the idea of bigness , Denmark hardly plays a role . In a world devoted to the ideal of greatness , it would occupy quite a considerable position . For if the greatest happiness of the greatest number of people is the ultimate goal to which all governments should aspire , Denmark has done more than enough to justify her continued existence as an independent nation . XVIII ICELAND , AN INTERESTING POLITICAL LABORATORY IN THE ARCTIC OCEAN FROM the days of her ancient imperial glory , Denmark has retained a few scraps of land , including that sixth continent , Greenland , which seems to contain valuable mineral treasures ( iron , zinc and graphite ) but which is so completely covered with glaciers ( only about one-thirtieth of the whole of Greenland is free from ice ) that it may never be of any value to any one unless the axis of the earth shifts just a tiny little bit and allows Greenland once more to enjoy that tropical climate which must have prevailed there millions of years ago , as we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields . Her other colonies are the Faroe Islands ( literally the Sheep Islands ) which lie 200 miles north of the Shetlands and have a population of about 20,000 people and a capital city called Thorshavn , from where Hudson commenced his dash across the ocean which carried him to Manhattan . And then there is Iceland . The latter is a country of particular interest . Not only on account of its volcanic nature , which makes it a veritable store-house for all those queer phenomena we usually connect with the mysterious fires from old Vulcan 's furnace , but also on account of its political development . It is the oldest republic of our planet with a record of self-government which began some eight centuries before our own and which with only a few short interruptions has lasted until today . The first settlers of the island were fugitives from Norway who found their way to this distant spot in the ninth century . Although 5000 square miles out of the total of Iceland 's 40 , - 000 are perpetually covered with glaciers and snowfields , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for purposes of agriculture , living conditions there were so much more favorable than in the mother country that already by the beginning of the ninth century there were over 4000 homesteads inhabited by free and independent farmers . And these , continuing the habits of practically all early Germanic tribes , at once established a loose form of self-government . It consisted of an " Althing " ? a gathering of the different local " Things " or " moots " ( which is really the same word as our " meeting " ) . This Althing met once a year during midsummer on a huge volcanic plain , called the Thingvellir and situated about seven miles distant from Reykjavik , the present capital , which is only a hundred years old . During the first two centuries of their independent existence , the Icelanders developed enormous energy , composed some of the best sagas that have ever been written , discovered Greenland and America ( five centuries before Columbus ) , and made this northern island , where in the winter the days are only four hours long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . But the curse of all Germanic races ? an all-too-pronounced individualism which makes political or economic cooperation almost an impossibility ? had accompanied the natives on their flight towards the west . During the thirteenth century , Iceland was conquered by the Norwegians , and when Norway became part of Denmark , Iceland followed suit . The Danes completely neglected the island , which henceforth was at the mercy of French and even Algerian pirates until all the old prosperity had disappeared , while the literature and architecture of the heathenish period lay forgotten and the ancient wooden buildings of nobles and freedmen were being replaced by huts made out of peat . Since the middle of the last century , however , there has been a return of some of the old prosperity and with it a renewed demand for complete independence . Today Iceland once more rules itself as it did eleven centuries ago , although outwardly still recognizing the King of Denmark as its sovereign . The // biggest city on the island , Reykjavik , has still fewer than ro , 00c inhabitants but is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants does not surpass the hundred thousand but they have an excellent literature of their own . There are no villages but only isolated farms where the children are taught and taught well by itinerant schoolmasters . Altogether this is a most interesting little corner of the world . Like so many other small countries , it shows what can be done when intelligence is pitted against unfavorable outward circumstances . For Iceland surely is no earthly paradise . While the winters are not very cold , due to the presence of a branch of the Gulf Stream , the summers are much too short to allow the raising of grain or fruit . And then , it is forever raining ! The twenty-nine volcanoes of which the most famous , the Hekla , has been responsible for twenty-eight outbreaks during the period of which we have any historical record , have covered // the island with vast tracts of lava , some of which are over a thousand square miles large . Earthquakes have upon occasion destroyed hundreds of farms and enormous fissures or clefts , running often for miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lakes of boiling mud make travel from one part of the island to the next a somewhat complicated affair . The geysers or hot-water gushers for which Iceland is so famous are interesting rather than dangerous , for although one of these , the famous Big Geyser , sometimes spouts its boiling water as high as a hundred feet , their activity is steadily decreasing . And yet people not only live on Iceland but want to go on living there . During the last sixty years more than 20,000 of them have moved to America , chiefly to Manitoba . But many of them have returned whence they came . It rains . And it is uncomfortable . But it is home . XIX THE SCANDINAVIAN PENINSULA , THE TERRITORY OCCUPIED BY THE KINGDOMS OF SWEDEN AND NORWAY THE people of the Middle Ages , who lived in a happy world of fairy stories , knew exactly how the Scandinavian peninsula happened to have got its queer shape . After the good Lord had finished the work of creation , the Devil came along to see what He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Heaven . When the Devil saw our planet in the first flush of its young loveliness , he lost his temper and got so terribly angry that he heaved a large rock at Mankind 's new home . That rock landed in the Arctic Sea and became the Scandinavian peninsula . It was so barren and bleak that it seemed entirely unfit for life . But the good Lord remembered that a little bit of rich earth had been left behind when he got through fashioning the other continents . These remnants he then sprinkled across the mountains of Norway and Sweden . But of course there was not enough to go around and that explains why the greater part of these two countries has always remained a home for trolls and gnomes and werewolves , because no human being could ever hope to make a living from such a poor soil . Modern man has a fairy story of his own , but it is a scientific one based upon certain facts which he has been able to observe with his own eyes . According to the geologists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old and very large continent which long before the era of the coal forests had stretched from Europe all the way across the Arctic Ocean to America . We know of course that the present arrangement of our continents is of very recent origin ? that the continents seem to be 196 // constantly on the move , like leaves floating on a pond , and that several contiients , now separated from each other by oceans and seas , were once upon a time a solid mass of land . When the continent of which Norway and Sweden had formed a part disappeared from view , only the eastern-most ridge ? the mountainranges of Scandinavia ? remained above water . So did Iceland and the Faroe Islands and the Shetland Islands and Scotland . The rest now lies at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean . Some day the roles may be reversed . Then the Arctic Ocean will become dry land and Sweden and Norway will be turned over to the whales and the little fishes . The Norwegians do not seem to lose any sleep on account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to worry them . The problem , for example , of keeping alive , which is by no means a simple one when you remember that in Norway less than four percent of the total area ( only 4000 square miles ) can be used for purposes of agriculture . Sweden is a little better off with ten percent , but even that is not so very much . There are of course certain compensations . One-half of Sweden is covered with woods and one-quarter of Norway is covered with pine and fir forests . These forests are slowly being cut down , but lumbering is not the devastating business it is with us . It is done in the most scientific way imaginable , for both the Swedes and the Norwegians know that their country will never be any good for ordinary agricultural pursuits . That is the fault of the glaciers which once upon a time covered the whole of the peninsula , from the North Cape down to Lindesnaes . These glaciers scraped the soil from the rocky hillsides as completely and efficiently as a hound dog licking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their hard earned soil ( it takes millions of years to make enough soil to cover such a vast stretch of land ) but they carried it away with them and deposited it all over that great northern plain of Europe of which I told you in the chapter about Germany . The scouts who went ahead of the great Asiatic invasion of Europe of forty centuries ago must have known this . When at // last they crossed the Baltic , they found Scandinavia inhabited by a few nomads of Finnish origin . It was easy enough to drive them back into the fastnesses of northern Lapland . But when that had been done , how could the new settlers hope to make a living ? There were several ways . In the first place , they could go out and fish . The endless bays and fjords , which were really nothing but deep grooves dug into the rocks by the glaciers trying to reach the ocean , gave the country a coast-line almost six times as long as it would have been if the Norwegian coast had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Denmark . The Norwegians are still fishing . The Gulf Stream sees to it that all the harbors , even as far north as Hammerfest , remain open the whole year around . The nooks and crannies of the Lofoten Islands , on the brink of those cool , clean Arctic waters which the cod seems to prefer for breeding purposes , provide work for more than a hundred thousand fishermen and to an equal number of people engaged in the business of canning whatever the trawlers bring on shore . In the second place , if they did not care to fish , they could turn pirates . All along the Norwegian coast there lies a row of islands and islets which account for seven percent of the country 's surface and which are separated from each other by such // a complicated system of narrows and sands and bights and straits that a steamer going from Stavanger to Vardo has got to carry two pilots who succeed each other every six hours . During the Middle Ages when there were no beacons and buoys and lighthouses ( Lindesnaes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is of comparatively recent date ) no outsiders would come within a dozen miles of this dangerous coast . Although the story of the famous Maelstrom between two of the Lofoten Islands has been greatly exaggerated , no inexperienced skipper would venture into this watery labyrinth without at least half a dozen natives to show him the way . Those pirates therefore who made their own familiar fjord their base of operations knew that they had little to fear as soon as they were within sight of the home range of mountains and they made very good use of this natural advantage . They imzoo VAN LOON 'S GEOGRAPHY proved their ships and their fighting technique until they could venture forth as far as England and Ireland and Holland . Once they had discovered the road to these comparatively nearby places , they gradually lengthened their voyages until the people of France and of Spain and of Italy and of far off Constantinople began to feel uncomfortable whenever some returning merchantman reported that he had seen the dragon of a Vining ship somewhere in the neighborhood . During the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than three times . They sailed up the river Rhine and got as far as Cologne and Mayence . As for England , different tribes of Norsemen fought each other for the possession of that country as the nations of Europe of today will make war upon each other for a particularly desirable piece of oil land . About the same time that Iceland was discovered , Norsemen had founded the first Russian state , of which they themselves were to be the rulers for almost seven entire centuries . Still later , a plundering expedition of two hundred boats ( small boats which could be carried overland whenever necessary ) had travelled from the Baltic to the Black Sea and had caused such consternation in Constantinople that the emperor of the eastern Roman Empire had hastened to take these wild men into his service , as a special sort of body-guard . Entering the Mediterranean from the west , they had established themselves in Sicily and on the coasts of Spain and Italy and Africa and had repeatedly rendered the most valuable services to the Papacy in its wars upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this glory of the ancient Norse nation ? All that remains today is a highly respectable little kingdom which catches and exports a lot of fish and engages in the carrying trade and fights bitter political quarrels about the language the people should speak ? quarrels of which the world at large would never notice anything if the Norwegian authorities did not have the fatal habit of changing the names of their most important cities and railroad stations about once every two or three years . THE SCANDINAVIAN PENINSULA 2o:E As for those cities of Norway , most of them are merely over-grown villages where everybody 's dog knows everybody else 's dog . Trondheim ( formerly Nidaros and then Trondhjem ) was the capital of the old Norwegian kingdom . It has an excellent harbor and as soon as the Baltic is covered with ice , Trondheim becomes the port from which a great deal of Swedish wood is shipped to the rest of the world . The present capital , Oslo , is built near the ruins of a very old Norwegian settlement which had burned down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore called Christiania until the Norwegians decided to purge their language of all // Danish souvenirs . Oslo is situated in the richest agricultural part of Norway at the head of the Oslof j ord , which runs into the Skagerrak , the broad sound which separates Norway from Denmark and which is really a branch of the Atlantic Ocean . Such cities as Stavanger or Aalesund or Christiansand only come to life when the whistle of the nine o'clock steamer blows . Bergen , the old Hansa settlement which looked after the commercial needs of the entire Norwegian coast , is now connected with Oslo by means of a railroad . So is Trondheim with a branch road that leads to the Baltic coast of Sweden . Further up north , well above the Arctic Circle , lies Narvik , the harbor for the Swedish iron ore from Lapland . Tromso and Hammerfest smell everlastingly of fish . These names occur here because it rarely happens that one finds human beings living comfortably at latia tude 7o ? . It is a strange land . It is a hard land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its sons and daughters away from its shores , asking them to shift for themselves as best they could , and that nevertheless has somehow or other managed to keep their love and loyalty . Take a boat sometime if you have a chance and travel northward . Everywhere it is the same . Some Godforsaken little village , clinging to a bit of grass , just enough for a single goat , and five or six houses and a few ramshackle boats and one steamer a week and people weeping because they see it again ? because it is home ? because it is their home ? because it is part of their flesh and blood . The International Brotherhood of Man is a noble dream . It takes on queer aspects in Bodo or in Vardo , ten days away by steamer from nowhere . Sweden , the other side of the mountain-range that remained after the great Arctic plateau had disappeared beneath the waves of the Atlantic , is a very different country from Norway . People often wonder why these two nations do net decide to form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cost of administration . On paper such an arrangement looks emiTHE // nently practicable . But their geographical background makes it impossible . For whereas Norway on account of the Gulf Stream enjoys a mild climate with lots of rain and little snow ( in Bergen the horses shy whenever they meet a man without an umbrella or a raincoat ) Sweden has a continental climate , with long , cold winters and a heavy snowfall . Whereas Norway has deep fjords that penetrate for miles into the interior , Sweden has a low coast with few natural harbors none of which have achieved the importance of Gothenburg on the Cattegat . And whereas Norway has no raw materials of its own , Sweden is possessed of some of the most valuable ore deposits of the whole world . The // unfortunate absence of coal still forces Sweden to export a great deal of these ores to Germany and France , but during the last twenty years the taming of many important waterfalls has made Sweden increasingly independent of coal while the forests that cover such a great part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust and the far-famed Swedish paper factories . The Swedes , like the Norwegians and the Danes ( one might say like all nations of Germanic origin except perhaps the English ) have unbounded trust in the potentialities of the human intellect . Her scientists are therefore given free scope and as a result her chemists have discovered and developed a large number of by-products which are derived from the wood industry and which otherwise would have gone to waste , such as celluloid and artificial silk . But her agriculture , although much higher developed than that of Norway , suffers from the unfavorable climatic conditions which are the result of being situated on the cold and exposed side of that high mountain-range which divides the Scandinavian peninsula so sharply into two halves . Perhaps that is one of the reasons why the people are so fond of flowers . The winters are so very long and dark . Every Swedish home therefore tries to keep bright with flowers and evergreen shrubs . In a great many other respects also Sweden is different from Norway . In Norway the feudal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? that terrible plague of the late Middle Ages which abruptly called a halt to all further Viking ambitions and activities . In Sweden , on the other hand , the continued existence of large land-holding interests has allowed the country nobility to maintain itself up to the present time . And although the country is now being ruled by a socialistic government ( like the vast majority of all other European countries ) Stockholm is still a city with an aristocratic background , in sharp contrast to Oslo and Copenhagen , where the utmost democratic simplicity is as rigidly maintained as courtly manners are practiced in the Swedish capital . Perhaps this development too is a direct result of Sweden 's THE SCANDINAVIAN PENINSULA zos curious geographical position . For whereas Norway faces the Atlantic , Sweden is essentially a country that looks out upon an inland sea and its entire economic well-being , together with its history , is interwoven with that of the Baltic . As long as Scandinavia was still a half-settled wilderness , there was little to choose between the Norsemen of the western coast and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of them " Norsemen " and the famous old prayer , " from the fury of the Norse , good Lord , deliver us , " was chanted without specifying what particular sort of Norsemen the humble supplicants had in mind . But after the tenth century there was a change . Then there arose a great and bitter civil warfare between the Swedes of the north , of Svealand , whose capital was situated on the Malar lake on which the modern capital of Stockholm is situated , and the Goths of the south or Gotaland . They were closely related , these two tribes , and worshipped their Gods near the same shrine , the City of the Gods , which was built on the spot where the town of Upsala rises today , the oldest and most important university town of northern Europe . These quarrels , which lasted more than two centuries , greatly strengthened the position of the no-bility while at the same time weakening that of the kings . Dur-ing this period too Christianity had made its entrance into the Scandinavian peninsula , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nobles ( in most countries it was the other way around ) until finally the Swedish monarchs became so weak that for a century and a half Sweden had to recognize the sovereignty of Denmark . Europe had almost forgotten that Sweden existed when in the year 1520 the western world was shocked by the tale of one of the most ghastly and inexcusable murders that has ever dis-graced the history of man . In that year King Christian II of Denmark had invited all the heads of the Swedish nobility to a great banquet ? a sort of love-feast which once and for all would settle all further difficulties between the King and his beloved Swedish subjects . At the end of the festivities all the guests were a06 VAN LOON 'S GEOGRAPHY taken prisoner and were either beheaded or drowned . Only one man of any importance escaped . That was Gustavus , the son of a certain Erik Vasa , who a few years previously had been beheaded by order of that same King Christian . Gustavus had then escaped to Germany . When he received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by starting a revolution among the ancient yeomen he finally forced the Danes to return to their own country , whereupon he himself was crowned King of Sweden . That was the beginning of that extraordinary era of national and international adventure which not only made this small and poverty-stricken land the champion of the Protestant cause in Europe but which turned Sweden into the last bulwark against the ever-increasing threat of a Slavic invasion . For the Russians , after centuries of oblivion , had at last gone on the war-path and had commenced that famous march to the sea which has not yet co-me to an end today . Sweden apparently was the only country which recognized the menace . During two whole centuries all her energies were concentrated upon one single purpose ? to keep Russia within bounds and away from the Baltic . In the end , of course , Sweden was bound to lose . The struggle completely exhausted her exchequer and it merely retarded the progress of the Russian steam-roller by a few decades . When it was all over , Sweden , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had ruled Finland and Ingermanland ( where Leningrad is today ) , Estonia , Livland and Pomerania , had been reduced to a kingdom of the second rank , with an area of 173,000 square miles ( something between Arizona and Texas ) and a population slightly smaller than that of New York City . ( Sweden has 6,141,671 and New York City has 6,930,446 . ) Half of this territory is still covered with forests , which in turn supply the timber needs of almost one-half of the European continent . These trees are cut down in the winter and allowed to lie around until after the beginning of spring . They are then // dragged across the snow to the nearest river and are dumped into the gorge . When summer comes and the ice of the inland mountains begins to thaw , the rivers , turned into torrents , pick up the logs and carry them down into the valleys . The same river which has thus far played the role of the railroad now becomes the source of power for the saw-mills , which pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a match-stick to a four inch plank . By this time the Baltic has become free from ice , vessels can once more reach the different parts of the western coast , and the finished wood products , which thus far have cost very little , except for the wages of the lumber - jacks and the mill-hands , are now entrusted to the steam-boats , which have continued to provide us with the cheapest form of transportation whenever time is not of primary importance . These vessels serve a twofold purpose . They would be obliged to go home empty unless they could pick up some sort of return cargo . Of course they can not charge much for these return cargoes and as a result , Sweden gets most of its imports at a very reasonable rate . The same system is followed in handling the iron ore which is of such excellent quality that it is in high demand even in countries which have ore deposits of their own . As the country is nowhere wider than 250 miles , it is always comparatively easy to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kiruna and Gallivara , there are immense deposits of iron which Nature for some mysterious reason has plunked down there right on the surface of the earth in the form of a couple of low mountains . In the summer the ore is taken to Lulea on the Gulf of Bothnia ( the northern part of the Baltic ) and in the winter , when Lulea is frozen fast , to Narvik in Norway , which , due to the Gulf Streams remains open all the year round . Not far from these iron deposits lies Sweden 's highest mountain , Kebnekaise ( almost 7000 feet high ) and there also stands one of the most important power houses of Europe . It is situated well within the Polar Circle but since electricity seems to // be indifferent about geographical latitudes , this station is able to run both the railroads and the machinery of the surface mines at a very small cost . The southern part of Sweden , which got a little of that soil scraped off by the glaciers of the north , is of course the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most densely populated . It has a great many lakes . As a matter of fact , Sweden , next to Finland , is the " lakiest " country in the world ; 14,000 square miles of it are covered with water . By connecting these lakes with canals , the Swedes have provided that whole part of their country with cheap means of communication , which greatly benefits not only the industrial centers like Norrkoping but also the harbors , of which Gothenburg and Malmo are the most important . There are countries in which Man has submitted to the dictates of Nature until he has become her abject slave , and there are countries where Man has destroyed Nature so completely that he has lost all touch with that great living mother who forever must remain the beginning and the end of all things . And finally there are those where Man and Nature have learned to understand and appreciate each other and have agreed to compromise for their mutual benefit . If you want an example of the latter , go north , young man , and visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE SWAMP ON THE BANKS OF THE NORTH SEA THAT BECAME AN EMPIRE THE word " Netherlands " , which is only used on very official occasions , means exactly what it implies , a combination of " low " localities situated from two to sixteen feet below the level of the sea . A single good flood of prehistoric dimensions , and Amsterdam and Rotterdam and all the most important cities would disappear from the face of the earth . But this apparent natural weakness of the country has also been the source of its greatest strength . For among these marshes along the banks of the North Sea it was not sufficient for Man to take hold of the country . Ere he could do that , he was obliged to create it , and in that uneven conquest between human ingenuity and the relentless forces of Nature , the Dutch people were triumphant . It taught them to be hard and watchful . In the sort of world in which we happen to live , those qualities are not without merit . When the Romans visited this distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty years before the beginning of our era ) , the entire region consisted of bogs and marshes protected against the ravages of the North Sea by that slender row of sand dunes which stretched all the way from Belgium to Denmark . These dunes were interrupted at irregular intervals by a large number of rivers and rivulets . Most important among the rivers were the Rhine , the Meuse and the Scheldt . Left entirely to their own devices and not hindered by any dikes , these three rivers did exactly what they pleased , and every spring they altered their course and created islands where no islands 209 // had ever been before and swept away vast tracts of land that had seemed as solid as the island of Manhattan . I am not exaggerat-ing . Upon one memorable occasion in the thirteenth century , seventy villages and almost a hundred thousand people disap-peared from view in the course of a single night . Compared to their Flemish neighbors who lived on solid ground , these early Hollanders lived a very miserable ex-istence ; but a mysterious change , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentage of the Baltic , gave them their chance . One day absolutely unexpectedly , the fish known as the herring moved from the Baltic into the North Sea . In an age when all the people of Europe were obliged to eat fish on FriTHE NETHERLANDS zit days and when fish as a staple diet of the human race was of much greater importance than it is today , this meant absolute ruin to a large number of Baltic cities and the sudden rise of a corresponding number of Dutch towns , which now began to supply southern Europe with that dried fish which then took the place of our canned goods of today . Out of the herring fisheries came the grain trade , and out of the grain trade grew the commerce with the spice islands of India . There was nothing extraordinary in this . It was the normal development of a commercial state . But when fate , regardless of all practical considerations , incorporated the Low Countries into the empire of the Habsburgs and decreed that a nation of lusty peasants and fishermen , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very practicalminded , should be administered by sour officials trained at the court of an absolute monarch who dwelled somewhere in dignified loneliness among the bleak hills of his windswept Spanish Castle-land , then there was bound to be trouble . That trouble expressed itself in a struggle for liberty which lasted eighty years and which ended with a complete victory for the inhabitants of the Low Countries . The rulers of the newly-founded state , being practical men of affairs , believed sincerely in the principle of live and let live , especially when it meant a profit to them . They therefore offered their hospitality and their protection to all those who in less fortunate countries were being persecuted for their beliefs , religious or otherwise . Most of these refugees ( with the exception of a small group of obscure English dissenters , who however did not stay very long ) became loyal subjects of the country that had given them the chance to start upon a new and happier career . As a rule their former masters had deprived them of all their liquid assets and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them wherever they went , and they contributed most generously to the commercial and intellectual development of their adopted fatherland . And when the war of independence was over , a million people , living in little cities built on the bottom of some old lake or inland sea , boldly as212 VAN LOON 'S GEOGRAPHY sumed the leadership of Europe and Asia and maintained that position for three generations . Then they invested their money ? bought themselves large country estates , foreign pictures ( which are of course always so much better than those painted by the talent at home ) and spent their days being respectable . They did their best to make their neighbors forget where the money had come from , and very soon the money forgot to come too . For nothing in this world can afford to stand still , least of all our human energy . And those who wo n't make an effort to hold what they have got will soon lose all , and that goes for ideas as well as for ducats . The end came during the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much geography as he needed to win his battles , claimed that since the Low Countries were merely a delta formed by three French rivers , the Rhine , the Meuse and the Scheldt , the country belonged by right of geological descent to the empire of the French . A large N scrawled at the bottom of a piece of paper undid the work of three entire centuries . Holland disappeared from the map and became a French province . In 1815 however the country regained its independence and went back to work . The colonial heritage , sixty-two times as large as the mother country , has allowed towns like Amsterdam and Rotterdam to maintain themselves quite successfully as centers for the distribution of Indian products . Holland has never been an industrial country . It has no raw materials except a little coal of very indifferent quality in the extreme south . It is therefore not able to provide its own colonies with more than six percent of all their imports . But the development of the tea and coffee and rubber and quinine plantations in Java @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands vast amounts of capital . This fact is responsible for the leading position of the Amsterdam stock-exchange , and the importance of Amsterdam as a place where people and nations go to borrow money , while the necessity of carrying all this merchandise to // and from Europe made it possible for the Netherlands to remain fifth on the list of national tonnage . The tonnage of the vessels used for the trade at home is higher than that of any other country . The country is honeycombed with convenient waterways and the canal-boat is the most dangerous rival of the railroad as it can be operated at a minimum of cost in a country where , until recently , the time element did not play a very important role in the daily affairs of men , women , cows , horses and dogs . A great many of those canals are really drainage ditches , for one-quarter of the kingdom 's territory is no land at all , in the usual sense of the word , but merely a piece of the bottom of the sea reclaimed from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by artificial means and perpetual watchfulness . Since the year 1450 thousands of square miles of land have been added to the country by the draining of marshes and by turning lakes into " polders " . To make such a polder is really very easy if you know how . First of all , you build a dike around the piece of water you have doomed for destruction and on the outside of that dike you dig a wide and deep canal , which is connected , with the nearest river into which it can pour its daily surplus by means of a complicated system of locks . When that has been done , you construct a few dozen windmills on the top of that big dike and furnish them with a pumping machine . The wind or a small gasoline engine will then do the rest . When all the water has been pumped out of the lake and has been pumped into the canal , you dig a number of parallel ditches across your new " polder " and , provided you keep your pumping-mills and pumpingstations working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of the necessary drainage . Some of these polders are quite large and are inhabited by as many as twenty thousand people . If the Zuyder Zee ever gets dried up ( the affair may prove a little too costly , now that every nation is on the verge of bankruptcy ) there will be room for at least a hundred thousand more . As fully one-quarter of the // country consists of such polders , you will easily understand how it happens that the Dutch Department of Rivers , Canals and Dikes disposes of more money every year than any of the other sub-divisions of the government . In strange contrast with the high fertility of this low part of the country , the higher regions of the east , where the central European plain met the sea before the formation of the big , marshy delta of the Rhine and the Meuse and the Scheldt , is of very little use to anybody . For thousands of years it was an un-loading station for the boulders and the pebbles of the northern European glaciers . In some ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is much more sandy and it gives the statistics of the Kingdom of the Netherlands that queer twist which al-lows a country with a density of population of 625 per square // mile ( France has only 191 , Russia 17 ) to carry a ballast of more than 25% of its total area as " territory which is essentially unproductive " . ( In France the percentage is less than fifteen and in Germany less than nine . ) And this curiously sharp line of demarcation between east and west and fertile and infertile also accounts for the presence of the mos e important towns in a single small triangle right in the heart of the polder-land . Amsterdam , Haarlem , Leyden , the Hague , Delft and Rotterdam are so close to each other as to form practically one large city and all of them lie close to the protecting bulwark of those famous sand dunes , at the foot of which the Dutch of three centuries ago began to raise and to perfect the pretty little bulbs of a flower called " Tulipa " which their merchants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Athens was only as large as eight New York City blocks . Any wheezy old flivver will carry you from one end of Holland to the other in a few hours . And yet , next to the territory of Attica , this narrow strip of land between the Rhine , the North Sea and the Zuyder Zee has probably contributed more to the sum total of our arts and sciences than any other region of similar diminutive proportions . Athens was a barren rock and Holland was a water-logged swamp . But they had two things in common when they suddenly leaped into fame ? an excellent geographic location from the point of view of international commerce , and a superabundance of animal spirits and spiritual curiosity , left over from the days when they had been obliged to fight or perish . And out of these their glory was born . XXI GREAT BRITAIN , AN ISLAND OFF THE DUTCH COAST WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HAPPINESS OF FULLY ONE-QUARTER OF THE HUMAN RACE UNTIL a few years ago this chapter would have been entitled " Great Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nature and turned a geographical unit into two separate entities . And all the obedient scrivener can do is to follow suit and give each of the two countries a separate chapter . Any other course might lead to far-reaching complications , and I would hate to see the Irish Navy sail up the Hudson River to demand an apology for this " insufferable insult to the national pride of Saorstat Eireann " . Dinosaurs drew no maps , but the rocks remained behind to tell their story . And they are all there ? the igneous rocks , volcanic products which got cooled off near the surface of the earth , and the granite , born under pressure , and the sedimentary rocks , slowly settling down along the bottoms of lakes and seas , and the metamorphic rocks , like slate and marble , which were really limestone and clay , changed into more valuable materials by the subtle chemistry of the great depths . They are all there , lying about in disordered profusion , like the furniture in a house struck by a cyclone . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They may account for the fact that England , which usually takes to the shooting of rabbits with greater zeal and interest than to the hunting of scientific facts , has given the world so many first-rate geologists . It may of course be the other way around : because there were a great many excellent geologists , we learned more about the 216 // geology of England than of any other country . But that hardly seems likely . Swimming champions are usually found near the water and rarely in the heart of the Kalahari Desert . And so the geology was there and the geologists were there , and what did they tell each other about the origin of the land of their birth ? Try to forget the map of Europe as you have come to know it today . Imagine a world which has only recently emerged from below the surface of the sea , which is still rocking with the effort of creation . Picture to yourself vast continents rising high and bleak above the waters , rent asunder by eruptions that crush the rocks as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the streets . Meanwhile the forces of Nature 's laboratory continue their patient labors . Incessantly the winds blow from the ocean carrying billions of tons of moisture on their way from west to east , drenching the land and giving it moisture , covering it with a wide blanket of grass and ferns , arranging for the main-tenance of shrubs and trees . Day and night and night and day and year after year after year , the tireless waves beat and pound and grind and file and crunch and rasp until the shores of the land wilt and crumble as the snow melts and crumbles before the rays of the insistent sun . And then suddenly the ice ? the slow , merciless wall of death that groaningly hoists itself across the steepest side of the highest mountain-ranges , that rumbles ponderously down the slopes of wide valleys , that fills deep // gorges and narrow ravines with frozen water and pieces of rock from the wasted hilltops . The sun shines ? the rain rains ? the ice cracks and creeps ? the waves gnaw ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his appearance , this is what he finds . A long narrow strip of land , cut off from the rest of the world by a flooded valley which reaches all the way from the Arctic to the Gulf of Biscay , another high plateau rising well above the waves and separated from the narrow strip by an unruly and choppy sea ? a few lonely rocks sticking out well above the surface of the sea , a perching place for gulls rather than a habitat for Man . That vaguely , very vaguely , was the way England came into being . Now let us look at the modern map and see what that shows us . From the Shetland Islands to Land 's End is the same distance as between the middle of Hudson Bay or southern Alaska and the northern frontier of the United States , or , in terms understandable to the average European , from Oslo in Norway to Prague in Bohemia . That means that England , one of the most densely populated countries in the world , with 45,000,000 people , is situated between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( opposite Alaska ) which also runs from about 50 ? lat. to 6o ? lat. , and where less than 7000 people just about manage to keep themselves from starving by living on an exclusive diet of fish . On the east , England is bounded by the North Sea , which is really nothing but an old depression which has gradually run full of water . Again a single glimpse at the map will tell you more than a thousand words . There on the right ( the east ) is France . Then we get something that looks like a trench across a road , the British Channel and the North Sea . Then the great central plain of England with London in the deepest hollow . Then the high mountains of Wales . Another depression , the Irish Sea , the great central Irish plain , the hills of Ireland , a few lonely rocks further towards the west , rearing their tops above the shallow sea . Finally the rock of St. Kilda ( uninhabited            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
