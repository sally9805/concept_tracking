txt President Roosevelt received today from his new Attorney General , Francis Biddle , a virtual carte blanche , from historical and legal points . of view , to deal as vigorously and drastically with problems arising from the present world - crisis as he believed the situation required . In his salutatory as a Cabinet member Mr. Biddle told the annual convention of the State Bar of California that " the magnitude of the threatened disaster " was the measure of the President 's " power and duty " to take steps necessary to avert it . Ordering the Navy to clear an Atlantic sea lane by sinking Nazi submarines , if necessary , was no different , he suggested later at a press conference , from sending American troops into the Boxer Rebellion to " shoot at sight . " In Iceland and the Atlantic , " as circumstances warranted , " the President had gradually expanded earlier territorial limitations dealing with protecting the lives of American citizens , but charges of " usurpation or dictatorial actions " by Mr. Roosevelt were , Mr. Biddle protested , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utter nonsense " to say that during this emergency we were " going to sacrifice things that we shall never get back . " Criticizes Lindbergh In answer to a question Mr. Biddle said that Charles A. Lindbergh in his last speech mentioning Jews as fomenters of war appeared to have " come into the open to declare a principle which seems , to me at least , to be un-American . " He said , however , to another questioner that such an utterance was " not seditious " and that Americans could go on even in wartime to express opinions . Mr. Biddle recalled that his predecessor , now Justice Robert H. Jackson , had backed a wiretapping bill which had been turned down in Congress . He said he personally thought a wiretapping bill under " the strictest sort of limitations in an - emergency " was desirable . In his address he asserted that the practice of making broad grants of power to the President to meet emergencies was neither a new nor a dangerous practice , " contrary to the somewhat naive assumption which seem to prevail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " from the earliest enactments concernea with our foreign relations , in the turbulent years which followed the French Revolution to the recent lend-lease statute , there has been an uninterrupted progress of consistent practice . " " Bold Executives and cautious Executives " abke have followed the " consistent pattern of national action , " the speaker declared , going on to say : " In the same consistent deterurination to safeguard our heritage , we are today cooperating with friendly powers in the Pacific and are fortifying new bases and reinforcing the far-flung patrol which guards the vital highways of the Atlantic . " Mr. Biddle chided the " timid souls " who , he said , had " doubted that democracy could be made to work when disaster . threatened . " " At this moment their voices are raised again , " he asserted , " to express the familiar fear that the very measures essential to defend democracy may in the end prove to be democracy 's undoing . " The record of great issues met and received by democratic processes is one which inspires an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to look at the record with an open mind and find their misgivings " speedily dissipated . " The Philadelphia lawyer enumerated his articles of faith . His first , he said , was " in the Constitution , " his second was " in the constitutional history of the United States , " and his third was " in liberty under law as it has come down to us , conserved and strengthened , through a thousand years of Anglo-American institutional history . " 4 ; warning to the nation against taking a short view of the emergency was voiced by Walter P. Armstrong of Memphis , Tenn. , president-nominee of the American Bar Association . " We must be tough - fibered enough , " he asserted , " to make all sacrifices , including both property and life itself , if necessary , for the attainment of the objectives which we think , essential . " Mr. Armstrong had a good word for the presently constituted Supreme Court , saying that in spite of " latitudinarian " trends of recent decisions the court probably never before in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  freedom of speech , of the press , of religion , and other inalienable rights . " " We hear much today about the freedom of the press , " he continued . " It is indeed one of our fundamental rights , one of our most precious possessions , but it seems to me that under the scheme of things as it today exists the value of a free and independent bar as a molder of public opinion is at least comparable to that of a free press . " Mr. Armstrong and Loyd Wright of Los Angeles , president of the State Bar of California , both criticized administrative agencies . Mr. Wright said that they had " run hog-wild " and that their administration had been " one of the dark marks upon the history of the administration of justice in this country . " He attacked the Wagner act as class legislation and predicted union labor 's e ? - entual " frantic disapproval " of for , he said , under it and related laws and trends , " labor unions are committing suicide .
