Homecoming ( MGM ) features Clark Gable as an army surgeon named Ulysses and Lana Turner as an army nurse called Snapshot . At first they do n't like each other at all , but after she has helped pull on his rubber gloves a few times , they begin to feel different . <P> But this is madness ! Clark has a nice wife ( Anne Baxter ) in the States , and , by all that 's Hollywood , he must go back to her . So Lana has to be disposed of finally-but not until her fans have seen plenty of Lana at the operating table , Lana at a Roman bath , Lana in the Battle of the Bulge , Lana on her deathbed . <P> The basic substance of Homecoming , like the base of a perfume , has a terrible smell ; but to many moviegoers , the end product will seem quite pleasant . It is superskillfully custom-blended to please the vast public of Gable &; Turner . World War II , reduced for long stretches to a faint , faraway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song . <P> Arch of Triumph ( Enterprise-United Artists ) is one of the outstanding misfires of the season . Those who made it shoveled some $5,000,000 into the mixer ; a couple of topflight romantic leads ( Ingrid Bergman and Charles Boyer ) ; a couple of topflight character actors ( Charles Laughton and Louis Calhern ) ; the strenuous talents of Director Lewis Milestone ; a massive , studious production ; and a somewhat bowdlerized version of Erich Remarque 's best-selling romance about political derelicts in the limbo of 1939 Paris . <P> By no very odd coincidence , something went terribly wrong with this mixture : the cement began to harden before it could be poured , and all hands had to get it out of the machine by brute force . Now &; then the picture faintly approximates the iron sadness and bitter glamor which Remarque tried for in his novel ; most of the time the deep grimness of the subject and the schmalziness of its exploitation get embarrassingly in each other 's way . <P> Charles Boyer , who is at once a master of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such tone and unity as it has . Miss Bergman occasionally breaks loose with an eager bit of acting , but it is seldom persuasive . As an international tramp , she is as badly miscast as Boyer would be as an All-America fullback ; and she is as tactlessly gowned as she is cast . <P> Messrs . Laughton , Camera and Milestone also do the best they can , and once in a while-notably at a White Russian birthday party-the picture comes to some kind of life . But on the whole the show has a kind of pathos that is not the kind intended ; the spectacle of a lot of talented people , before and behind the camera , doing their desperate best in an effort which they seem clearly to know is foredoomed . <P> Fort Apache ( Argosy ; RKO Radio ) , John Ford 's first movie since his apostolically solemn Fugitive , is an unabashed potboiler . An idiotically reckless martinet ( nicely played by Henry Fonda ) tries to impose spit &; polish on a begallused garrison in the Far West . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is posthumously adored as a hero-except by the men ( John Wayne , et al. ) who had to carry out his orders . His daughter , a stock Pert Chit by the name of Philadelphia Thursday ( Shirley Temple ) , meanwhile romances with a young officer ( played , in appropriate magazine-illustration style , by Miss Temple 's real-life husband , John Agar ) .
