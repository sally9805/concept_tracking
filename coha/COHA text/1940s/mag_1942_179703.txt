U.S. liquor production will stop completely on or before Nov. 1 . This jolting news hit front pages all over the country last week when prim , precise WPB Alcohol Expert Matthew MacNamara revealed that U.S. distillers would be 100% converted to war alcohol within two months . The U.S. needs alcohol for its huge synthetic-rubber program , its booming smokeless powder plants , its busy plastics and chemical factories . <P> On top of this bad news for U.S. conviviality the W.C.T.U. abruptly suggested that present liquor stocks be converted into undrinkable commercial alcohol . Drinkers did not have to take the ladies seriously-converting present whiskey stocks would take too long . <P> Although there is an adequate liquor supply for a medium term war ( warehouses bulge with enough to last four years ) , some changes in drinking habits are on the way . Both gin and blended whiskies will presently disappear . Straight whiskey alone will remain . A proposed $2-a-gallon Federal tax boost would end the sale of popular dollar-a-pint whiskies , forcing many to drink cheap beer and wine . <P> Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stiff cocktail and more than four gallons go into making a single synthetic tire , the U.S. will use 476,000,000 gallons of commercial alcohol next year , four times any pre-war year . Most of this huge increase will be met by the liquor makers , who have an estimated capacity of 435,000,000 gallons annually . If things go as planned , the liquor industry will supply the newly developed war alcohol market ( rubber and powder ) and regular alcohol producers will handle the ordinary market ( plastics , lacquers , chemicals , anti-freeze ) . <P> The liquor companies lose nothing by this deal . Main reason : when they started commercial alcohol production last December they got OPA to boost prices from 24 to 50 a gallon . Results have been fine . Six months ' profits of the four biggest distillers-Distillers Corp. - Seagrams , Hiram Walker , National Distillers , Schenley Distillers-jumped 40% to a smacking $14,814,000 after taxes . At the same time combined earnings of 290 bigtime U.S. industrials dropped 35% . Moreover , the liquor industry may get " vacations " from war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of business after the war while it waited for new whiskey to age . Thus , if this war does not stir up another wave of prohibition , distillers can count themselves lucky .
