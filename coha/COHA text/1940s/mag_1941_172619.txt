Last week the press and one lawyer put the State of Missouri to shame . When the Legislature finally adjourned , they made it plain that the last legislative session was the worst , dirtiest , most brazenly corrupt in Missouri history . <P> The session was also the longest on record , 186 days . Little constructive legislation was passed , but more money was appropriated than ever before-$250,000,000 . The public and the press were disgusted . So was Charles Martin Hay of St. Louis , a big , easygoing , full-time lawyer and part-time reformer . <P> Known as one of St. Louis ' ablest attorneys , Hay is a big , heavy-set man with a black mustache , a good showman who loves " fightin ' and speakin ' , ' ' a classic corn-country orator who began making speeches at the age of eleven on the Ozark farm where he was born . <P> Charley Hay got mad . One evening he hired a truck , drove to the Capitol steps at Jefferson City , mounted the truck and began making a speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legislature as a whole was shattered and that of certain legislators was in ruins . He named names , produced documentary evidence , told stories . In the crowd were several of the men he named , some cynically amused , some grimly serious . <P> Hay made a simple challenge : let the Legislature investigate itself . He would appear , testify under oath , bring witnesses , produce evidence . Hay , reading his notes by a flashlight held by his niece , Mary Hay , attacked " sandbag " bills . <P> He cited the " crematory " bill-a perfect " sandbagger . " This measure would have required that no person in Missouri be cremated for 48 hours after death . Reason given : possible traces of murder , such as poison , could not thus be destroyed . Kicker in the bill : everybody to be cremated must first be inspected by the local coroner . Fee : $10 . Natural effect of such a bill was to arouse high hopes in Missouri coroners ; to arouse opposition among cemetery operators . Hay charged : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plan through which they would receive money . " * <P> The St. Louis Post-Dispatch named other " sandbag " operations : <P> &gt; Distributors and operators of jukeboxes raised a fund of $14,000 to insure defeat of bills outlawing such artistic instruments in saloons or taverns . <P> &gt; The State Chiropractors ' Control Board voted $2,500 to insure the defeat of legislation inimical to chiropractors . <P> &gt; St. Louis firemen , members of an A.F. of L. union , voted $5,000 out of their treasury " for legislative purposes " : to promote a bill providing firemen 's pensions . <P> &gt; Etc. , ad nauseam.
