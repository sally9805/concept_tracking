THE use of wealth to undermine the system which produced it is an old story  --  as old as revolutionary history . Anacharsis Cloots , a Prussian nobleman , gave part of his fortune to the French Jacobins . Friedrich Engels , rich textile manufacturer , was Karl Marx 's patron and alter ego . Sava Morozov , the Russian textile king , was Lenin 's angel in Czarist days . The process goes on in the United States , where the latest American fortune to be left by a Communist fellow traveler for radical causes is that of Robert Marshall . His father was Louis Marshall , constitutional lawyer , lifelong partner of Samuel Untermyer and a conservative Republican . Robert Marshall , a scientist in the United States Forest Service , died November 11 , 1940 , at thirty-eight , and left an estate of $1,534,070 . He willed 33000 to a friend . The remainder he divided into four equal parts . One part went for the preservation of American wild life ; one part for the cause of civil liberties ; two parts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States based upon the theory of production for use and not for profit . " Bob Marshall was by training a plant physiologist , geographer and explorer . He had mapped Northern Alaska for the Geological Survey , but at heart he was a map maker of Utopia . He lived modestly and gave away tens of thousands . His generosity was unsentimental and anonymous . He had great simplicity without affectation , and was naive beyond belief . He named his two brothers , James and George , among the trustees of his will . James Marshall , president of the Board of Education of New York City , is a progressive Republican and strongly anti-Communist . George Marshall is an orthodox Stalinist and a contributing editor of Soviet Russia Today , semiofficial Soviet organ . Other trustees are Gardner Jackson . for many years a Stalinist busybody in Washington ; Jerry O'Connell , a one-term congressman from Montana , and one of the heroes of the Communist Daily Worker ; Edwin S. Smith , fellow-traveling member of the National Labor Relations Board ; Heber Blankenhorn , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and John Finerty , a liberal lawyer . Of the other six trustees , three are Government experts who shared some of Marshall 's scientific interests , two were personal friends of no known political orientation , and the sixth is Roger N. Baldwin , director of the American Civil Liberties Union . Robert Marshall intended his fortune to go the way of the Garland Fund , which became a golden transmission belt for Communist propaganda . In 1919 , Charles Garland , of Buzzards Bay and Boston , came of age and inherited close to $1,000,000 . " Barley " Garland was a tall , handsome youth who had given up Harvard after one year , married a society girl , acquired a baby , and then decided to find himself . The Saint Francis of Buzzards Bay W DISCOVERED that he was a Tolstoyan , a primitive Christian anarchist . He also found that capitalism was a complex form of robbery , and that man was intended to work the land in simple peasant communes , where everything from affections to wealth should be freely and equally shared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a number of like-minded spirits . Some of them were sophomore saints like himself , others were in a more advanced state of emotional disarray , still others were mere spongers in Utopia . Garland 's new philosophy did not permit him to enjoy the wealth that came to him from his grandfather , James Garland , though later he did consent to keep the income from a smaller trust fund , which , according to his friend , Roger N. Baldwin , yielded a mere $8000 to $10,000 a year . But just as our Saint Francis of Buzzards Bay , in 1921 , was about to let his million slip , his hand was stayed by another and very different kind of " philosophical anarchist . " Roger Baldwin is primarily a promoter of left-wing enterpriser which have no base in popular movements . His ambition is to be the man who pulls the strings behind left-wing America . He is forever maneuvering himself into strategic positions on all sorts of pink and red committees , . whc sa him a reputation as a professional idealist . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the philosopher and guide of revolutionary debutantes of both sexes . Baldwin persuaded the young anurcho-millionaire to put the million to work as an antitoxin to the poisons of the capitalist system . He suggested that they form a foundation to aid the propaganda of all left-wing faiths without regard to their mutual exclusivenes.s  --  a disregard which Mr. Baldwin confuses with " philosophical anarchism . " And on July 31 , 1922 , the American Fund for Public Service , Inc. , commonly known as the Garland Fund , was Er ' newborn babe . Another member was the late Mary McDowell , head of the University of Chicago Settlement and a leading Methodist , who represented the best in our democratic tradition . Then there was Norman Thomas , perennial Socialist candidate for President . Thomas is really a typical liberal , whose good intentions are paralyzed by chronic hesitation . Along with these liberals Baldwin mixed in William Z. Foster , then a secret member of the Communist Party , and later its national chairman ; Scott Nearing , in those days a devout Marxist vegetarian ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chicago , and now the dean of American fellow travelers and secretary to the government of the Virgin Islands ; and the Rev. Mr. Harry F. Ward , professor of Christian ethics at the Union Theological Seminary , and later head of the leading Communist transmission belt , the League for Peace and Democracy . Mr. Lovett soon succeeded Doctor Magnes as chairman . In 1926 , Benjamin Gitlow , who had been the vicepresidential candidate of the Communist Party and was later its general secretary , joined the board . The new ladies of the ensemble were Elizabeth Gurley Flynn , formerly the Jeanne d'Arc of the I. W. W. , and now a member of the national committee of the Communist Party , and Clarina Michelson , a Boston debutante who became a leading Stalinist glamour girl . But the most significant newcomer was Robert W. Dunn , who succeeded Baldwin as secretary of the board .

This does not mean that all its money , or even most of it , went to such organiza- tions . But in its grants for journalism , research , books and pamphlets it distinctly favored the totalitarian left . One of its early beneficiaries was the Daily Worker . The Daily Worker was started with an original subsidy of $35,000 from the Communist International , and it continued to receive the same amount from the same source every year through the 1920 's . It had a free cable service from the " Socialist fatherland . " It had more than 10,000 obligatory subscribers in the Soviet Union whose subscriptions were paid in a lump sum by Moscow . And whenever the Kremlin " donated " money to break up American unions , sums which ran into the hundreds of thousands , the Daily Worker got a cut for its " educational work " in these unions .

The Fellow Travelers ' Rid Fund TN THE course of years , the Garland Fund also I helped various magazines which were the official organs of Communist or fellow-traveling agencies , such as the Labor Defender , organ of the International Labor Defense . It gave $2000 to the Labor Herald , organ of Foster 's Trade Union Educational League , and $2000 to Fight , organ of the League for Peace and Democracy .

When asked how the board of directors was chosen , he replied , " Probably I picked the members . " If he did , he anticipated by years the Kremlin technique of " amalgamating " Communists and their stooges with professional liberals and left-wing dilettantes . The first chairman of the board was Rabbi Judah L. Magnes , a gentleman and scholar , and as guileless as a PACE O'Connell swallowed . He had to get the thing out of his throat . Finally he spoke softly . " I ai n't afraid of this place no more . You done that for me . Nobody ever done no more . I 'm gon na be a champeen like you said . Maybe if I was around here , I 'd just wan na stop by an ' let ya know how I was doin ' , see ? ? Somewhere within the prison a bell rang . Feet began to shuffle on stone floors .

Fifty-one per cent of the stock in International Publishers is held by the Communist International , and the rest by Mr. A. A. Heller . Mr. Heller , one of the few Red angels who have made their own money , laid the foundations of his fortune selling oxygen to the Allies during the last war . Later he became one of the leading Soviet concessionaires in this country . The Garland Fund also financed a great deal of Communist-inspired research , all of which arrived at the same conclusion : American workers must join Communist unions . In 1925 the Garland Fund gave $17,000 toward the establishment of the New Masses , a Communist political and literary weekly , which was to carry the party line into the world of American arts and letters .

With an initial gift of more than $105,000 , later increased to almost $145,000 , it established the Vanguard Press . This house published some worth-while books , especially a number of cheap pocket editions of various revolutionary classics  --  Marx , Engels , Kropotkin , Ruskin .

" of its books were of the clich ? leftwing variety . It published a series on the Soviet Union , which was a mere rehash of Soviet propaganda , edited by Dr. Jerome Davis , who ran annual propaganda tours to the Soviet Mecca and later run the American Federation of Teachers as a fellow-traveling agency of the Communist Party until he was displaced in 1939 . Today this " liberal , " according to Mrs. Roosevelt 's My Day , is in Canada doing splendid work for the Y. M. C. A. among German prisoners there . By 1930 , the Vanguard Press had flopped and the fund sold it to James Bente , under whose management it is today a sound commercial publishing firm . The Garland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave the Rand School of Social Science $16,000 , which was used primarily to publish the Labor Year Book , an invaluable reference work , which had to be discontinued in 1932 for lack of funds . And it gave $40 , - 000 toward the establishment of the New York Leader , a labor daily which appeared on October 1 , 1923 , and closed shop on November twelfth , six weeks later . Its editor was Norman Thomas , its business manager Evans Clark , now director of the Twentieth Century Fund , and its managing editor Heber Blankenhorn , now a trustee of the Marshall Foundation . The Leader went through more than $100,000 in six weeks by engaging in expensive competition with afternoon dailies which had millions behind them . It covered the world series by direct wire , and when the series was finished , , so was the Leader . The subsidy which most significantly revealed the Garland Fund 's fellowtraveling propensities was that granted to the Federated Press . The FP , a news service for progressive and labor papers . was founded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former managing editor of the Milwaukee Leader . The board was a mixture of liberals and labor editors . Robert Morns Lovett was president . Mrs. Frances C. Lillie , a member of the wealthy Crane family , of Chicago , manufacturers of bathroom fixtures , was vice president and helped the FP financially in the beginning . Among the labor members were E. B. Ault , editor of the Seattle Union Record , Herbert E. Gaston , editor of the Minneapolis Star , and Robert M. Buck , editor of the official organ of the Chicago Federation of Labor . The FP began as a weekly news bulletin . Unfortunately , Costello , who was a good newspaperman , was a poor manager . Within a little more than a year the FP had rolled up a deficit of $48.500 , and applied to the Garland Fund for aid . William Z. Foster , Roger Baldwin and Robert Morss Lovett , who was on both boards , decided that Costello must go if the Garland Fund was to help . The correspondence between the Garland Fund and Costello , filed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the objection to Costello was his refusal to submit to Communist pressure . In July , 1922 , Carl Haessler was given his job as managing editor . Haessler , a Rhodes scholar and former instructor of philosophy at the University of Illinois , had been in Leavenworth during the war as a Marxist war objector . He was and is a Communist fanatic , and during the next decade and a half was the party whip in the Federated Press , though he has probably avoided party membership . Tom Tippett , later the fellowtraveling personnel director of PM , the New York daily , and now with the National Youth Administration , became business manager . During the next three years the Garland Fund poured into the FP more than $38,000 and later $44,000 more . Ever since , the leading personnel of the Federated Press have been either Communists or fellow travelers , though on its board are a number of confused Socialists and progressives who give it a nonpartisan camouflage . Twentieth-Century " Martyr " For years the FP 's Washington correspondent was Laurence Todd , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its star reporters have been Anna Louise Strong , American Soviet propagandist and a former editor of the Moscow Daily News , and Art Shields , now of the Daily Worker . Its New York manager today is Marc Stone , who is closely associated with the party line . Henry Zon , its Washington correspondent , writes for the New Masses , indicting as stool pigeons critics of the Communist wrecking crew in the American labor movement . The Garland Fund was used only partly for Communist propaganda . But all of the money left by the late Bishop Brown for " the advancement of Marxism " went to the Daily Worker . William Montgomery Brown was the Protestant Episcopal bishop of Arkansas from 1900 to 1912 . After his retirement , he began to study " materialism " and finally became converted to Communism . Of the bishop 's sincerity , there was never any doubt , and there was just as little doubt that his Marxist scholarship was of the bestself-taught ham variety . He began to turn out one crackpot volume after another , starting with Communism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Boys and Girls , which he published at his own expense . In 1925 , the House of Bishops unfrocked Bishop Brown . The Communist Party made a terrific campaign in his defense , indicting the House of Bishops as reactionary pharisees who were persecuting a modern Christian martyr simply because he did not believe in Christianity . Bishop Brown was a wealthy man by marriage , and he had invested his money judiciously in Cleveland real estate . When he died in 1937 he left , according to The New York Times , " between $300,000 and $450,000 . " The amount earmarked for the " advancement of Marxism " was $250,000 . Marxist or not , the Daily Worker got the money . One of the busiest American propagandists in defense of the Soviet Union is Corliss Lamont , son of the Morgan partner . He is a contributing editor and the main angel of Soviet Russia Today . Two other wealthy men , George Marshall and A. A. Heller , are also contributing editors . For years , Lamont met the monthly deficit of this cockeyed journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baltic states at their " voluntary " annexation by Stalin . Left-Wing Pedagogues In 1936 a group of scholars decided to publish The Marxist Quarterly , devoted to a critical evaluation of modern Marxism . Among them were Prof. Sidney Hook , of New York University , Mr. Louis Hacker , a historian at Columbia , and Dr. Sterling Spero . Lamont , after consulting Earl Browder , decided to join this group , and contributed about $1000 . But when it became obvious that the Communist Party could not capture the journal , Lamont withdrew and joined a new and completely Communist-dominated quarterly , Science and Society . In his letter of resignation from the editorial board of The Marxist Quarterly , he frankly stated : " I prefer to throw what weight I have with a board generally sympathetic towards . . . the Communist Party . " Among the editors of Science and Society were Edwin Berry Burgum and Margaret Schlauch , of New York University , and V. J.

The business manager is our old Comrade A. A. Heller . He and Lamont have both put money into it . Since the Rapp-Coudert Committee to investigatesubversive activities in New York schools and colleges became active , the editors of this " academic " journal are unlisted . One of the most pretentious pseudoacademic agencies which , until very recently , followed the party line is the so-called Institute of Propaganda Analysis , founded in 1937 with a grant of $10,000 from Edward A. Filene 's Good Will Fund . This fund was set up by the late Edward A. Filene , whose money came from the great Filene department store in Boston . The institute announces : " Approximately 1,000,000 are estimated to be using the institute 's publications in study groups and classrooms . " The institute has a board of directors , an advisory board and a special publication committee . Most of these people are innocents , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boss and the editor of the institute publications is Clyde R. Miller , of Teachers College at Columbia . During the last war he testified against Eugene V. Debs and helped to send him to prison . The ensuing remorse supposedly drove Mr. Miller to the left ? unfortunately , to the totalitarian left , which Debs execrated . The monthly bulletin is full of condescendingly knowing discussions of various propaganda " techniques . " The issue of ? March 1 , 1939 , is entitled Communist Propaganda , U. S. A. , 1939 . With an air of amused detachment , it does the Communist Party the service of discounting the effectiveness of its propaganda in this country . The bulletins on foreign affairs , even since the Russo-German pact , have rather subtly followed the party line . The bulletin of January 15 , 1940 , is called Mr. Dies Goes to Town . It smears the Dies Committee by emphasizing its unfortunate beginnings , when it permitted a few irresponsible witnesses to reflect on innocent people , and failing to indicate that in time the committee developed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For this type of propaganda the institute received , in the year ending on September 1 , 1939 , $13,000 from Edward A. Filene 's Good Will Fund ; $12,500 from the American Jewish Committee , whose board is composed of wealthy Jewish fs.nocents ; $4000 from the Whitney Foundation , and almost $1700 from miscellaneous sources . Innocents at Home During the Popular Front days , the Communist Party proliferated innocent front organizations at the rate of about one a week . Almost all of them were busy putting out official organs , pamphlets , books and leaflets . Behind this drive were dozens of party officials , paid by the party an average of thirtyfive dollars a week , who were posing as liberals and acting as editors of the various publications . Most of the money for these publications , many of which were fly-by-night affairs , was raised in this country from wealthy sympathizers and innocents . Penthouse Bolsheviks , left-wing New Dealers , the Hollywood swimming-pool contingent , which included some wellknown stare , directors and script writers , contributed hundreds of thousands . Much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits -- just how much nobody knows . Such magazines as Fight , or TAC , organ of the Theatre Arts Committee , publications for youth , the unemployed , aid to China , Spanish democracy , or what have you , were either partly or entirely supported by well-to-do Americans , most of whom had not the slightest idea what they were support-ing . A number of the Communist transmission-belt magazines are still going . One of these is Amerasia , ostensibly devoted to an objective interpretation of the Far East . It is completely pro-Soviet and its editor is a Mr. Philip Jaffe , who , under the name of J. W. Phillips , edited the now defunct Communist journal , China Today . Amerasia operates at an an nual loss of several thousand , which Mr. Jaffe makes good . He is a successful nonunion manufacturer of Christmas cards in Brooklyn and has for years contributed at least $5000 a year to the Communist . Party . With Jaffe on the editorial board of Amerasia is Frederick Vanderbilt Field , a scion of the Vanderbilt family and chairman of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was elected executive secretary of the Communist-inspired Emergency Peace Mobilization held in Chicago . Another fellow-traveling journal is Equality , founded early in 1939 . Its editorial council has been changing rapidly , but un it , at one time or another , have been the usual leading fellow travelers , such as Prof. Franz Boas , chairman of the American Committee for Democracy and Intellectual Freedom , an innocent front in the academic world completely dominated by the Communists ; Dorothy Parker , the writer ; Lillian Hellman and Albert Maltz , playwrights ; Leane Zugsmith , a novelist ; Dashiell Hammett , writer of detective stories ; and Max Yergin , Communist president of the American Negro Congress . Equality was hot for war against Fascism before the RussoGerman pact , but since then it has been " isolaticinist " in the fake Stalinazi sense . It specializes in fighting antiSemitism , and in the beginning some of its money came from well-to-do Jews whose fears it exploited . During the Popular Front days , a number of well-known book publishers were more or less under Communist influence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an outlet for Communist and fellowtraveling authors ever since its foundation in 1937 , though it passes as an ordinary commercial firm , and that is Modern Age Books . Its list reads like un American Bolshevik Five Foot Shelf . It publishes the works on labor of Bruce Minton and John Stuart , both of the New Masses . It published the Communist works of Granville Hicks , John Strachey 's Hope in America , Mary Heaton Vonie 's Labor 's New hlillions , a Communist version of the CIO , the Reverend Harry F. Ward 's Democracy and Social Change , and Look at Labor , by Leon Goodelman , who was extremely active in the Young Communist League . Modern Age Books is subsidized by Richard Storrs Childs , a young man of great wealth , who has poured into it between $300,000 and $400,000 . His fortune comes from public utilities . His father , Starling W. Childs , is head of the S. W. Childs Management Corporation . Mrs. Francis Neilson , formerly Helen Swift Morris , who inherited great wealth from her father and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $400,000 to The Freeman , which lasted from 1920 to 1924 . The Freeman was a single-tax journal , but aside from its political unrealism , it was brilliantly edited , The New Freeman , edited by Suzanne La Follette , with Albert Jay Nock as contributing editor , was very much in the old Freeman tradition . It was founded in 1930 and folded up in 1931 , and it was supported to the tune of $75,000 by Dr. Peter Fireman , a wealthy manufacturing chemist of long radical background , and a friend of Friedrich Engels . The Partisan Review , an esoterically highbrow quarterly , claims a revolutionary bias . The editors are Frederick W. Dupes , an instructor at Columbia , Dwight Macdonald , a former editor of Fortune , George L. K. Morris , who is interested in " abstract art , " and WilLiam Phillips and Philip Rally , two free-lance literary critics . They began as fellow travelers of the Trotsky movement , now all shot to pieces . But they always welcomed the most varied opinions , and among their contributors are John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T. S. Eliot , and Pro- fessors Sidney Hook and Meyer Scha- piro . Mr. Morris supports the journal , whose national circulation is about 2000 . The hill is around $3000 a year , He is a member of the wealthy Morris family of New York and a brother of Newbold Morris , president of the New York City Council . His father , the late Major Newbold Morris , left an estate of more than $7,000,000 . The two magazines which have given most aid and prestige to the Communists in this country are the two leading professional liberal journals , The Nation and the New Republic , The Nation was founded in 1865 . But its liberal phase began with the editorship of Oswald Garrison Villard in 1918 . Villard inherited the New York Evening Post and The Nation , which was its weekly supplement , from his father , Henry Villard , who had made a fortune from the Northern Pacific Railroad . He sold the Post to Thomas W. Lamont in 1918 , but kept The Nation . The Fate of The Nation Villard 's perpetual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against anything that may come up , made The Nation a lively journal during his editorship . In 1935 he sold it to Maurice Wertheim , a New York banker and leading patron of the Theatre Guild . The magazine 's deficits during Villard 's ownership amounted to $300,000 . Of this sum . Villard himself paid $100,000 ; another $100,000 came from Agnes Brown Leach , whose fortune comes from Brown Brothers , investment hankers ; and the rest Villard raised among his liberal friends . Wertheim put in about $75,000 more . But in 1937 he objected strenuously to The Nation 's defense of the court-packing scheme , and sold it for a song to Freda Kirchwey , who had been one of its editors since 1918 . Miss Kirchwey is not a rich woman , though her husband , Evans Clark , inherited some money and has a good position as head of the Twentieth Century Fund , founded by the late Edward A. Filene . Miss Kirchwey herself is neither a Communist nor a fellow traveler . She is merely confused and timid , and she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the staff when she bought the magazine was Maxwell S.

Stone , formerly an editorial writer on the New York Evening Post and a fellow traveler ; and James A. Wechsler , a recent Columbia graduate who had been an active fellow traveler in the American Student Union . The Nation 's foreign correspondence was almost exclusively pro-Soviet until the RussoGerman pact . Harry Block , its Mexican correspondent , is hand in glove with Toledano , outstanding Mexican labor leader , who is hand in glove with the Soviets . The late Robert Dell , The Nation 's Geneva correspondent , was a straight fellow traveler .

The New Republic , on the other hand , from 1935 until the Russo-German pact , was merely a " liberal " echo of the New Masses . It was founded in 1914 by Herbert Croly , with money provided by Mr. and Mrs. Willard D. Straight . Willard Straight had been in the diplomatic service in the Far East . Later he represented the Morgan , Harriman and Standard Oil interests in China . On his return from the Orient he married Dorothy Whitney , whose father , William C. Whitney , amassed one of America 's largest fortunes , and whose mother was Flora Payne , of the Standard Oil Payne family . After Straight 's death in 1918 , his widow , now Mrs. Leonard K. Elmhirst , continued for a good many years to subsidize the New Republic to the tune of $100,000 a year until she went to live in England . Then she established a trust fund of which the New Republic is a beneficiary .

By the mid-thirties the staff of the New Republic had completely changed . The present controlling editors are Bruce Bliven , Malcolm Cowley and George Soule . Bliven is a liberal who never knows his own mind , which is made up for him by his associates . And Soule and Cowley adhered to the party line like glue during the Popular Front period . During the Popular Front days , except on the issue of collective security , the New Republic was , in effect , a party-line organ . Since the Russo-German pact , the New Republic , like The Nation , is strongly proAlly . Like The Nation today , it represents the left wing of the New Deal .

It was discovered that Gillmor was active in various Communist transmission belts . He is the son of Horatio Gonzalo Gillmor , a retired rear admiral , and he supposedly inherited a fortune from his mother ; subsequently . it was learned that young Gillmor 's inheritance was rather small . His desire to buy the Post coincided with the efforts of the Communist Party to have in America a respectable liberal daily which would follow the party line , an experiment which had proved most successful in pre-Hitler Germany and in Popular Front France . In Germany , the Communist paper with a liberal front was Die Welt Am Abend , in France Ce Soir , in Sweden the Aftonbladet .

Boyer , a fellow traveler , who later became a foreign correspondent for the New York daily , PM . The magazine has run for about a year . It is a smooth-coat journal , does an excellent two-color job , and is full of expensive art layouts . It is estimated that at least $200,000 of somebody 's money has already been poured into it . Early in 1939 , newspaper circles in New York began to hear about a prospective five-cent tabloid which was going to revolutionize the American newspaper business . Early in 1940 , the advance publicity began to appear . The promotion was superb . The new paper was to be a thing of beauty . It was to print " unorthodox news , " " all the news that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was to be highly departmentalized and the articles in each department were to be signed . It was to he uncorrupted by advertisers , but would have a department called News for Living , which would digest the advertising in the other papers . Above all , PM was to he written by " the most brilliant staff ever gathered together on one newspaper . " The promoter , prospective publisher and editor was Ralph M. Ingersoll . He had been managing editor of the New Yorker until 1931 , then managing editor of Fortune , and in 1936 had become publisher of Time . In 1937 Mr. Ingersoll organized a " study group " under V. J. Jerome , the " cultural commissar " of the Communist Party . While he was publisher of Time , that magazine followed the party line , cleverly and subtly , but none the less clearly , in its labor and book-review departments . The record is in Time 's back numbers , for anyone to read . Mr. Ingersoll was remarkably successful in interesting rich Americans in the new enterprise . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American journalism for so many wealthy families to get behind a new daily . Mr. Ingersoll was right . The $1,500,000 stock issue was oversubscribed by $1,000,000 . The two largest stockholders on the board of directors , announced in February , 1940 , were Marshall Field III and John Hay Whitney . Neither Mr. Field nor Mr. Whitney nor any of the other wealthy stockholders could possibly be called a Communist or a fellow traveler . PM appeared on June 18 , 1940 . According to the advance publicity , more than 11,000 experienced newspaper people had applied for jobs . Yet the majority of the staff of 151 had had no newspaper experience , and some of them had no distinction as writers of any kind beyond the spurious build-up they had received as " distinguished " authors in Communist and fellowtraveling circles . The number of Communists and fellow travelers on the staff immediately became a public scandal . Mr. Ingersoll found it necessary to advertise in The New York Times that he was not running a Communist newspaper . He also published a denial in his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitors , and asking the Government to investigate PM . Had the Government done so , it would have found the following Communists or fellow travelers among the more important members of Mr. Ingersoll 's staff : Leo Huberman , labor editor ; Leo Goodelman , labor reporter , former leader in the Young Communist League ; James A. Wechsler , formerly of The Nation , who supported th Communist presidential ticket in 1936 ' David Ramsey , former Commu editor and ghost writer for Earl Browder ; Carl Randall . now foreign editor , first president of the New York Newspaper Guild , which is Communistdominated ; Tom O'Conner , former leader of the Communist faction in the Los Angeles Newspaper Guild ; Harry Greenwald , authority on " youth , " formerly , under the name of Harold Patch , youth editor of the League for Peace and Democracy ; Julius Korchein , housing expert , former Russian-government official , whose wife was an editor of the Moscow Daily News ; Margaret Bourke-White , a great photographer and a devout fellow traveler ; Elizabeth Hawes , editor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ League of Women Shoppers ; Richard 0 . Boyer , now Mexican correspondent and undeviating fellow traveler ; Marion Bachrach , Washington correspondent ' and Stalinist ; Leane Zugemith , staff writer , another Stalinist ; William Gropper , for years the leading cartoonist of the Daily Worker and the New Masses ; Selwyn James , foreign desk , former member of the Marylebone section of the Communist Party of Great Britain ; Tom Davin , research director , formerly of the New Masses . Were it not tiresome , one might name ? another dozen notorious Communist Party members or sympathizers on the initial staff of PM . Just Another Tabloid It was only some six weeks after Marshall Field took over the control of the paper that Mr. Ingersoll at last came out with an unequivocal antiCommunist editorial . Before the pa-per was three months old , it had run into financial difficulties . On October eighteenth the other stockholders sold their interest to Mr. Field at twenty cents on the dollar , plus a 15 per cent interest in nonvoting stock in the new corporation . Marshall Field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The majority of " the most brilliant newspaper staff " in America were fired . Today , PM is another New York tabloid , competing with the New York Post as a New Deal organ . From now on , it is most unlikely that wealthy Americans will subsidize , innocently or otherwise , Stalinist su version . The world situation has drastically changed . Stalin is too clearly the silent partner of the totalitarian axis . The innocents are waking up . But during the last two decades , rich Americans have supported Communist and fellow-traveling journalism and other propaganda in print to the tune of more than $3,000,000 . During the 1930 's the non-Communist leftwing press , liberal or radical , got thousands where the Communist-dominat press got hundreds of thousands . An this is only a small fraction of wha wealthy innocents or " revolutionary " millionaire playboys have contributed to American Communism .
