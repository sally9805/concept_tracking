Love , Klieg-lighted and aromatic , came to television last week . In Los Angeles , over the Don Lee video network , 26-year-old William Vincent Hazen took Marian Padelford , 19 , to be his lawful wedded wife . A dental technician , Bridegroom Hazen planned to celebrate his marriage vows with a script of his own devising . It included such dialogue as " My future plans are of educating the public in the immense perennial humanitarian program that the dental profession has mapped out for those who will but come to its portals . All of which bounteously builds up to better dentistry for better living . Marian , I 've loved you from the day I first met you . Will you share it with me ? " <P> Unfortunately , for dentistry , the bride got pretty sore at this toothy folderol during rehearsal , accused her beloved of being more eager to advertise his wares than her charms . At that point the groom slapped the bride . The bride retaliated in kind , and also refused to go through with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremony . Eventually she had her way . The course of television love met further obstacles . Before the bride arrived at the studio altar , in came Fan Dancer Faith Bacon . Clad in a brassiere and a G-string , with feathers in her hair and on her heels , Miss Bacon insisted , wedding or no wedding , that she was going to do her uninhibited stuff before the television camera . In honor of the occasion , Miss Bacon offered to put on a fur neckpiece , was enraged when Don Lee officials rejected her compromise . <P> Throughout the historic ceremony , Miss Padelford , wearing traditional white dress and veil and carrying a bouquet of heat-stricken gardenias , chewed quietly upon a wad of gum , as did her three bridesmaids . Constantly eased out of camera range by Bridegroom Hazen , Miss Padelford was only occasionally visible on the television screen . Municipal Judge Joseph Marchetti , who performed the ceremony , was inundated with confetti ( rice will not televise ) by a prop man with deplorable aim . After the service , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and groom made a mad rush to congratulate the newlyweds . <P> Also in the rush was a worried representative of the Los Angeles department store which had costumed the bride and bridesmaids . Briskly he whirled the participants away before the gowns could be damaged by enthusiastic friends .
