txt It has remained for the visiting John S. Dodd , M. P. , president of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce , to say one of the soundest and wisest things said by any of the British or American delegates to the International Business Convention at Rye . Britain , he declared , must increase its exports , not because it wants to take over other markets , " but because we have to pay for our imports . " This is much more obvious in the case of Britain than in our own , because present-day Britain must import to feed its population , and it must import raw mater.als  --  raw cotton and raw woo , hides and skins , iron and wood , oil and rubber  --  before it can turn out most of its finished manufactured products . But though the precedence of imports over exports is more obvious in Britain 's case than in our own , it is equally true of us that the basic advantage of our foreign trade consists in our imports rather than exports . We tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as outstandingly in the case of rubber . But there are all sorts of other imports which we should sadly miss as a nation if they were suddenly cut off  --  coffee and sugar , cocoa and tea , hides and skins , newsprint and wool , nickel and manganese . These are things that we either do not produce enough of , or would be able to produce at excessive expense or not at all . The classical economists clearly recognized that the main advantage of foreign trade for any country lay in imports , and that the chief function served by exports ( looking at , the matter from the standpoint of the nation as a whole ) was to pay for necessary imports by the cheapest means . But the mercantilists who preceded the classical economists , and the intellectual successors of those mercantilists today , take the opposite view . This comes mainly from looking at the matter exclusively from the standpoint of the producer rather than that of the consumer . Most foreign trade conventions consist of producers ; not of consumers , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the producer and the exporter . That is why the theory most often heard is that foreign trade is necessary to " get rid of surpluses " or to " find an outlet for our surplus production . " This theory overlooks the fact that most of the " surpluses " discussed have been produced in the first place for the very purpose of meeting an already existing foreign market that is expected to continue . We do not produce a surplus of all goods , but only of a group of goods , and we produce this surplus precisely ( looking at the question from a national view ) to pay for a deficiency in our production of other goods which must be made up by imports . If all nations recognized the fundamental truth about their own foreign trade problem that the president of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce has just reiterated for Great Britain , the prospects for sane international trade policies in the postwar world would be enormously improved .                @ @ @ @ @
