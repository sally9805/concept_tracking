Near Berchtesgaden is a little Bavarian village named Unterstein whose normal preoccupations are tourists and farming . Today Unterstein is an art center . In a whitewashed building , once a rest center for German railway workers , the American joist Airborne Division has put on display Hermann Goring 's fabulous $200,000,000 collection of art works , the crme de la crme of the loot of Europe . <P> After visiting Unterstein last week , TIME Correspondent Percy Knauth cabled : <P> This fantastic treasure was discovered by a Seventh Army counterintelligence task force which was scouring the countryside for hidden stores of bullion . They first found an empty cave built into a hillside , then Captain Harry V. Anderson found the engineer who had designed the cave . One room , the engineer said , had been walled up . The wall was broken down , and there , in dripping darkness , was the Gring treasure . <P> Next Captain Anderson found a stoutish , red-faced , blond-haired man named Walter Andreas Hofer . He is a former art dealer who for the last eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identified the pictures , and told how most of the collection was acquired . <P> Hofer maintained stoutly that everything was destined for museums and for the benefit of the German people , and that everything was legally acquired . The story does not stand up . For . one thing , in some photograph albums of Gring 's various homes , notably Karinhall near Berlin , you will see most of the paintings hung on Goring 's very private walls . For another thing , Hofer 's own story makes it clear that , despite all sorts of legalistic shenanigans , it was generally the pressure of Gring 's name and station that finally closed the deal . <P> Favorite &; Rival . Lucas Cranach , an early 16th-Century German master , was a Gring favorite , and he had some beauties-about 50 in all . He had a lovely Venus by Cranach , a Madonna with Child and John the Baptist , and a haunting portrait of Prince Moritz of Saxony as a boy . " It is a curious thing , " Hofer added , " but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter . " <P> There are five Rembrandts , the most valuable being a famed portrait of an old man painted in 1660 , when Rembrandt took to using a knife blade and brush end instead of the straight brush technique . " I had to buy it in a hurry , " Hofer said with a smile , " because Hitler 's buyer was also there in Paris , and he could have outbid me . " <P> This seemed to smack of artistic rivalry between Hitler and Gring , and Hofer confirmed the suspicion . But it seems that Gring and Hitler eventually agreed that , since Hitler preferred 19th-Century art , he should have priority on that and Gring could have the rest. * Hitler 's collections , according to Hofer , are now hidden in caves somewhere in Germany , and have not been found .
