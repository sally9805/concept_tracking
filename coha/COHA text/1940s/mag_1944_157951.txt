Astronauts ( people who dream of traveling through interstellar space ) have been sleeping dreamlessly since the war began . Reasons : 1 ) lack of materials for building space ships ; 2 ) the drafting of astronauts for more immediate work on military rockets . But by last week many enthusiasts were stirring in their sleep and dreaming again of the interplanetary takeoff . <P> " Flight into outer space , " exclaimed Harry Harper , a spokesman for the new Combined British Astronautical Societies , " is no longer a Jules Verne or Wellsian dream . " His British group includes able young chemists , physicists and plane engineers . In spare-time work on their hobby , they have laid out a campaign , to start with the launching of experimental rockets 60 miles into space , * and culminating in a three-man jorney in a 1,000-ton space ship , already designed , to the moon . <P> 20,000 M.P.H. Harper 's group figures that the 240,000-mile trip to the moon would take only 48 hours ; in the celestial vacuum their ship would attain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquid oxygen and gasoline for fuel , would be propelled by a series of rockets whose shells could be jettisoned as they were used up ; the ship would eventually weigh less than a tenth of its take-off weight . Passengers would be protected against acceleration effects by springy hammocks , against extreme heat &; cold by rotation of the ship 's outer shell , to distribute the sun 's heat evenly on all sides . <P> Arrived at the moon , the ship , steered and braked by auxiliary rockets , would settle down rear end first . Its passengers , in diving suits , would emerge to explore the moon 's surface . The rocket ship would take off again from a portable launching platform . After regaining the earth 's atmosphere , the voyagers and ship would land by parachute . <P> 7 M.P.S. Astronauts actually talk like that in fairly low voices , without breathing hard . The fact that no astronaut has yet succeeded in shooting a rocket more than two miles up does not shake their faith . They have learned something of what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineering details . Some of the problems are clearly posed in a new book ( Rockets ; Viking ; $3.50 ) by Willy Ley , onetime colleague of German Professor Hermann Oberth , reported inventor of the robot bomb ( TIME , July 10 ) . <P> The speed at which a rocket would have to travel to get free of the earth 's gravity has been calculated as seven miles per second . The best rocket fuel yet tried ( liquid oxygen and gasoline or alcohol ) has a theoretical propulsive limit of two miles per second , and no actual rocket has approached that limit . Using the best present metal alloys and fuel , says Ley , a rocket ship designed for a round trip to the moon would have to be one-third the height of the Empire State Building-apparently a practical impossibility . But war research has improved fuels and alloys , produced new high-flying antiaircraft rockets . Ley , anticipating further improvements , is sure that " the rocket to the moon is possible . " With the impregnable calm common to astronauts , he observes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached a rather high state of perfection . ' '
