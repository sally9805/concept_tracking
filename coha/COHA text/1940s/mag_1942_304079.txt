Dissension Among the Allies <P> U.S. Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox got out his old blunderbuss last week and fired a shot heard round the world . He caused a lot of damage and hurt a lot of people . <P> He was just indulging the luxury , so dear to Frank Knox , of getting exercised about U.S. morale . He was afraid that the people were taking accounts of German failure in Russia and unrest at home a little too seriously . So he made a most unfortunately worded statement : <P> " We know who our great enemy is , the enemy who before all others must be defeated first . It is not Japan ; it is not Italy . It is Hitler and Hitler 's Nazis , Hitler 's Germany . It is Hitler we must destroy . That done , the whole Axis fabric will collapse . " <P> The strategy of concentrating on Hitler might or might not have been adopted , and may or may not be good . The British would naturally have been pleased by such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been urging just that . Some believe that Winston Churchill came to Washington to sell just that bill of goods . And yet it began to be realized in London last week that the Churchill Government has mishandled affairs in the Orient . The Prime Minister himself knows little of the subject except what he learned as an enthusiastic poloist in a Punjab regiment in Kipling 's India . A Cabinet shake-up was demanded . <P> To Russia the strategy of European priority would be both good news and bad . Stalin 's greatest enemy is certainly Hitler , and anything that hurt Germany would help Russia . But Stalin 's greatest fear is that Japan may strike at his rear-and therefore he wants continuing Allied resistance in the Far East . <P> But to two other Allies , the Chinese and the Dutch , the strategy would mean a grim alternative-surrender or death . <P> Fury . The Chinese and the Dutch were not too happy anyhow . They had been slighted in the formation of the Allied Supreme Far Eastern Command . Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek had not been taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlikely bone-operations in Indo-China and Thailand . The Dutch had been left out altogether . And yet the Allied Supreme Command demanded Chinese troops , airmen and goods in Burma ; then proceeded to Java and began to tell the Dutch what to do . <P> The Knox statement was the last straw . Two days after the Secretary made his statement , N.E.I. Lieut . Governor General Dr. Hubertus J. van Mook , one of the shrewdest horse traders in the world , arrived in Washington and put the Dutch case strongly and clearly : we will fight , but we need help . Out across the green islands of the Pacific the Dutch Army &; Navy were writing his words in action . <P> The Knox statement made the Chinese blow their top with righteous anger . Said the Chinese military , through their Chung-king newspaper Sao Tang Jih Pao : " Signs of Anglo-American reinforcements are absent while British and American authorities continue to indulge in sidetracking remarks . " <P> Sixteen leading Chinese organizations in New York were even more specific in a telegram to President Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is threatened and the American Fleet still persists in doing nothing in the Pacific then we have the right to be disappointed with our Allies and will be forced to decide our own destiny .
