 | old father knew a thing or two  --  one of these fine days . Here she was marrying the finest fellow in New IIartford , and being pigheaded and full of judgment about her own wedding list . Little would she ever know what it took to blast out New Hartford as he had done . Cold shoulders , lethal looks and sneers turned into eager smiles in five years . Mam'selle being there and painting the children onto the walls had been some help , but who but James had really done it all for Jennie and Mollie ? Who ? It seemed only last week that Mollie 's and Sally 's voices had echoed up from the conservatory as they babbled French fables and laughed and then were silent again . At last he was dressed . He went downstairs . He had been sitting in the dining room for a long time when he heard Mollie 's step on the marble stairs . She came in and kissed him , just the same as ever , still his and Jennie 's only child . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter ? She put her arms around him and gave him a sudden extra squeeze . She sat down and looked at her prepared and jigsawed orange . It was her last breakfast as Mollie Evans  --  tomorrow Mark 's Own . Mark 's own Own . Now the descendants of the New England Settlers looked engraved , with a sharp instrument , not hewn from stone like their ancestors or their miners . Then there were the hawk faces and the weazel eyes , and the fat men with contours diffuse as mud , and those with folds of flesh for necks , with as much instinct for profits as pigs for garbage in the wind . . . . And always there was that unrecognized spiritual kinship between the descendants of the Settlers and the immigrants . If any of the scions of old New Hartford remembered at the wedding that James Evans had once been a blackened miner blasting coal in Evanspitt , no look or intonation betrayed it . They came , all of them in their best , draped in great-grandmother 's point lace . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Leyden or in Scrooby . Annie Sewell , in her time , was rich , but she never had anything but her lily-of-the-valley bar-pin in onyx and a coral string that Matthew bought on the dock at Naples . ) Allida Hollinshed sat , the very morning of the wedding , desperately patching a corset cover for her only daughter to wear at the wed-  | ding , although she was within two blocks of the best department store and the bank , where her checking account rarely sank below five figures . It was hard to get away from their chaste upbringing and New England ways just because the coal royalties had been pouring in for some years now . Anyone with eyes , hidden behind the tall palms at the Evans 's that night , could have picked out who was real New Hartford from the newcomers who had arrived with the coal . There was a subdued and impeccable elegance in their clothes , something unconscious and authentic about the way the men wore their dress suits . They would have carried homespun or overalls with just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coiffed perfection . Downright gorgeous some of them were , in dazzling beaded gowns , bright satins , brighter than New Hartford would deign to wear . They showed more breast above deck , more back for those in the line behind . Their perfumes were a shade more strident ; their jewels were larger  --  perhaps even a few imitations lurked among them . Their laughs were a shade louder , their voices far less resonant . More vehement , they moved and spoke with an exaggerated precision , an almost metallic cordiality . Their faces , too , told the whole story . The Settlers ' decendants bore traces here and there of not utterly well-spent days , but everyone was distinguished . For real New Hartford had learned how to stand even when they could have still lain down in the cradle , how to sit , how to move forward , how to get away when coalescing too long with those not to be tolerated a moment longer . Even if an observer looked down upon them from the second story and saw only the tops of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could still be picked out from the other guests . Real New Hartford knew how to negotiate a big wedding , the others did not . They were as helpless in tides and currents as the beach-wrack of debris of the Susquehanna at flood . Ornate marble vistas of house and conservatory melded into a lustrous setting for the pageant . The imported orchestra paused and then sounded the clarion call of the wedding march . The eight ushers , who had come hastily up the back stairs , descended in military dignity , two by two , down the wide front stairs . The  | bridesmaids in orchid films , carrying golden-gate roses cuffed in pleated gauze , set their slippered feet in the slow rhythm . Sally , maid of honor , followed them . She reached the turn in the upper hall which brought her , too , in sight of the packed guests , herded behind the flower-bound garlands which made the aisles below . The perfectly timed orchestra made her steps simple . The dresses of the last pair of bridesmaids tarried for a moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next below , as the procession descended . Mark and Mollie would be man and wife on the morrow , one for all of life  --  dear Mark , dear Mollie . They were so different from each other . Would that make it harder or easier to live together ? If two Winlocks married each other , they must love each other so violently that they must soon be destroyed or commit crime . If they quarreled even once , the misunderstanding must swell into irreparable tragedy . It was terrible to be a Winlock . Her " Blessed Heritage , " under the cauterizing brilliance of Luke 's talk , had shrunk away from her . Some day Markle would probably have to run the Evans Mine at Evanspitt  --  along with the Coldspring . The dresses moved down one more step . Sally 's mauve-slippered foot appeared beneath the golden draperies of her dress , as her descent lifted the many layers of its air-spun texture . Her sister-to-be had allowed her to plan her dress , so long as it fitted into the larger color scheme . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gold of golden-gate roses . Sally must , of course , carry the lavender of the bridesmaid 's dresses . Orchids were the obvious thing , of course , but Sally had suggested a predominance of Scotch heather . Mollie 's had really found irresistible was blue-checked gingham and geraniums in polished used tin cans , though none of her daughter 's contemporaries could know that . As the procession came down , it made a cleft below . The young were divided from the old , even as they stood packed close . The young looked at Mollie and saw in her themselves at last  --  and  | soon , if luck held . The middle-aged found their eyes moving from the hopeful and radiant face of the bride to that of her father It was grave and wonderful in its still and all-engulfing emotion . The blaze of light rippled along the natural sculpture of Sally 's head . Her dress was somehow the mourning weeds of queen and vestal . As he watched , old Freeman , who thought in symbols , saw that Sally was sensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking of that night , the middle-aged remembered Sally longest . But the bawdy curiosity even of the young , who were savoring her first public appearance since Luke had run away with her cousin , was somehow mislaid with the coats . As she reached the tessellated marble of the lower hall , handsome Edward Lewis ' complacent grin seemed to loom toward her . The wall of faces had no more individuality than the fitted patches of marble at her feet except for his unwarranted intrusion . Her eyelashes quivered , that was all . Edward had made a condescending proposal with his blind brash egotism less than one week after Luke 's desertion . His sour-grape witticisms had seeped everywhere from the Connecticut Club after that  --  barbed for Sally and Luke . A ghost of a smile passed on Sally 's face . Before that climb to Shawnee , the girls had gathered in the Winlock drawing room . With a giggle , Marion had said , " I do think Edward 's handsome . " Sally had answered , " Handsome Edward ! You can have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see your idol bold , All that glitters is not gold . ' " There the bridesmaids had come to a stop . For Sally the first days after Luke 's desertion were filled with moments when thought of him was like a lung-wound . Now she was failing Luke at the moment-by-moment trysts , even for hours at a time . Three times a day she had to call out to him . Whenever she heard the mine whistles  --  morning , noon and night , her heart said , " Luke , where are you now ? " If she could stand tranquil through the marriage ceremony for another , she would be a long way on the steep road to acceptance . Mollie 's sweet , matterof-fact healthy mind was to be a Winlock 's best dower . And  | dear , dear Mark was good enough even for Mollie . His coffee would always be perfect . She would be smiling at him over the ancestral Winlock silver . Mollie never woke up in the night from bad dreams and failed to sleep again , believing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluttering against the window screen that night . Lucky Mollie . Sally had made her father invite her Uncle Archibald , saying , " If I can , you should be able to . " Had he come ? She wondered . Beatrice 's mother had died after the elopement . After she died New Hartford had felt more kindly toward the impossible Mrs. Sewell and her pretentious heart-trouble , which they felt she had used for many years as an excuse to desert the valley through all the mean weather and the worst strikes . In collusion with her despicable husband , they had duped all the titled of Europe who were within the social-range of rich , even of well-bred Americans . Beatrice had not married a title , but Luke . In that way New Hartford could sneer , and that was that . Now New Hartford stood in suspension , packed close in the Florentine drawing room , with the sonorous wings of the marriage service rising before Mark Winlock and Mollie Evans , making them man and wife . For Sally , at last , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot tears threatened to break through and steal the ice of her control , melted into the freer movement of the reception . She took her place in the line ; simple and natural now . Some of the long-faded belles , with the charm of ancient and fine porcelain , admitted that there had never been a more beautiful couple in New Hartford . Mollie radiated like a stage light , and Mark burned with a still , banked flame . He had brown eyes and blond hair ; she was born platinum blonde before the term was thought of , and carried larkspur-blue in her eyes . James was in a princely humor  --  genial , happy , making each separate guest feel as though the wedding could scarcely have taken place at all unless he or she or they had come . He was too free and happy to remember times past when no one had come to call , even to see the inside of the new house . It was the one time since his wife 's death that Mollie herself had seen him so abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that night . Every little detail had been his care , even before the first guest  | came . He inspected the preparations as conscientiously as though he were still fire-boss down a mine . He had examined with special care the little bride and groom on top of the five-storied cake ? bride pure blonde ; groom , dark eyes , light hair  --  just as he had specified . He had put on his glasses to make sure . A wide table at the dining-room door groaned under the boxes of fruitcake done up in tin foil heavy enough to make counterfeit coin , and tied with white brocaded ribbon and a real orange blossom  --  real on the fifteenth of March . There were fresh lobster , and a vast salmon ripped from the Rystagooch , cooked whole , brought whole from New York with a special caretaker holding one fin all the way up the dizzy rick-rack braid of the Lehigh Valley Railroad . Of the shoal of spinsters who had not married because none of the men who had asked them had been quite their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not give James a timid , gracious , cordial or come-on smile . Everyone had had a gloved hand shaken now . The bridal bouquet was thrown from the stairs . It was the most New Hartford thing about the wedding  --  sweetheart roses , each a bare half-inch across , and heather , with a Puritan 's plait for a cuff . Upstairs the din below was only a well-bred hum mixed with the noise of champagne corks going pop , pop , pop . James stepped from his own room where he had withdrawn for a moment to mop his brow . He went into Mollie 's where she was donning her little gray helmet for her new life . She was already wearing her gray suit . She threw her arms around him as though she could never let him go . Her joy made her feel different in his arms , impalpable , sentient , the very quality of her already changed  --  all pulse , no longer his chunky little girl . " Father  --  Father , " was all she could say . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not too early . You must rest .... " She and Mark stepped into a high-powered thoroughbred little car that was swished suddenly to the back door . It was one more of James 's presents to young Mark . The motor whirred low . The sharp night air drove in as they sped off , washing away the crowd and confusion , the clatter and the raised voices . A two-thirds moon appeared now and again , between low-lying clouds . It washed the dun road up the mountain to winding  | silver . . . . Outside flashed the little quiet houses , here and there ; lights , towns , collieries , swam past tremulous as heat in summer , unreal as all her childhood now . The last guest had gone . Silent , efficient organization of the revel 's remains was under way . The caterers were going back on the second milk train , leaving at five , as they had a wedding in Tuxedo the following evening . James Evans deposited himself in a Florentine chair , too tired to care that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His short stubby hands looked inadequate and like a child 's as they rested on the faces of the pompous lions on its arms . The whiteness of his wilted cuff made more noticeable the blue powder burns across his knuckles . The entire chair was inlaid with lozenges of mother-of-pearl , which to James suggested only healed burns . The decorator had been very firm with Jennie , though , and told her it must remain because it " belonged . " James at that word distinctly had not belonged , so the argument was unanswerable . George Butts , his butler  --  one might even say general manager ? was standing in the doorway looking now at his master . " Hello , George , " said James . " Turn off the fountain and put covers on the cages , please . Bet the birds are glad it 's over , or did they like the best orchestra in all New York ? No , I do n't want you to turn the fountain on ever again . Not in the morning . Never . Ever been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman like you . Well , if you suddenly hear water dripping , it 's bad . If you hear it trickling , it 's all over . Pre-glacial riverbed overlies the coal , right under where you are standing this minute . Well , if you work in the mines , you 're set against dripping spigots and bum plumbing for good . And as for fountains ? " " Breakfast in bed , sir ? " " No , breakfast on the table at seven-thirty . " " Right , sir . " George was gone . James had a sudden surge of longing to have him stay beside him and they 'd have a couple of drinks and a bawdy story like Schlitz 's in the old days . What did a New York decorator know about making a place pleasant inside , alongside of a genius like Jacob Schlitz ? Of course , Jacob did get a little odd at the end ,  | with some bride 's wedding shoes tied up over the bar , and some kind of pressed flowers that looked too much like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bait and sinker , and taken care of a graveyard . In the morning James would deed this too-big and now tooempty , echoing house to Mark and Mollie and go back to Evanspitt . That 's where he 'd live the rest of the time he had . He picked up a telephone on a sixteenth-century Florentine inlaid desk upon which no one in the United States had ever written even a postal card . " Hello , you . Well now , is this my young friend Freeman ? Still alive after this wedding ? You surprise me . Pretty good for an old man like you . . . . Yes , I feel fine . . . . No , she never suspected a thing . . . . Guess I bet on my old pump , and if I had n't been a brave man you'da scared me to death , that 's what ... How 'd she look . . . ? Hmmhmm . . . Ever see a finer fella ? .. . Neither did I. . . . If you'da spoiled her big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , how 'd I ever have lived this long ? Tell me that , when two of her tears upset me worse than a six-point drop in the market all in one day . . . . Fine wedding with me in bed on your bilge . . . ! You mud-sill , you came mighty near killing me that day you told me . . . . Bet she 'd call you skunkerino ' for me  --  worst word she 's got . Come on over , skunkerino , and have a drink . . . . No . . . ? " New Ha'tford turned out , did n't it ? Pshaw . See that old hatrack Dennison who was making eyes at me ? Looked like Sheba an ' Jezebel put together . . . . Pshaw . " Think I ought to take an aunt back to Ant Hill and Evanspitt with me ? No , skunkerino , but I 'm goin ' back myself in the morning . . . . Did all this fuss and bother for Mollie . . . . Tell her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off any day now , but it takes a lot to kill an Evans . Might make a little pile for my first grandchild . If I thought I 'd live to be deaf , dumb and blind and a drag on Mollie , I 'd buy me own ticket . I 'd marry old Sheba and never die , just let her nurse me with her teeth gritted tight so they do n't slip out . . . . How soon can I count on a grandchild ? Still nine months , ai n't it , for couples like them that never jump the gun ? Fifty years ' work out of sixty enough ? Pshaw ! Yeah ,  | pleased her mother . . . . I know that . . . . Oh , nothing . Glad Mark 's mother had passed on , must say . She'da been a scab at this wedding . Jennie . . . . Yes . . . . Well , we used to talk about this day so much when Mollie was little it seemed most as though she knew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't look in tomorrow . You 'd send me a bill first of the month . You remind me of my leaky pump and it makes me pretty sick to my stomach to see your buggy and now that cheap old car of yours . Where 'd you pick up an antique like that ? " The telephone clicked . The bird cages must all have been covered , the conservatory was now dark . Not a drop of water sounded from the fountain . " Should I stay down , sir ? " asked George . " Would you have one drink with me , George ? Pay me that compliment ? " " Oh , sir , Miss Mollie 's last orders to me , sir , not to . " His pale humorless face showed distress . " All right , damn you . All right . All right , " bellowed James . " You 're still tied to her apron strings . No petticoat government for me , do you hear ? " Then , with a break in his voice , James said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Make allowances , will you ? Kind of a strain . . . see her go . . . ye know . . . . Take my arm , George . Let 's go up now . " Their feet tapped in unison on the cool marble which did not stay warm even a half-hour from all the best feet so lately passing on their way up and down . At his door he said , " Good night , George . Guess you know we could n't get on without you to tell us what we got ta do . You 'll have a little raise this month , now you 're nursemaid too . Helpin ' the baby up the steps .... " His door closed . James sat down in his room . Why go to bed and get up again ? He turned off all the lights and then put on the one directly over his wife 's portrait . It was not much comfort but it cost plenty , and that was something . . . . Schlitz 's saloon was the only spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head . To think of turning a saloon-keeper of that caliber into a flower-grower and gravedigger ! Schlitz getting religion had been a  | sad blow to a good many old pals . He 'd go to Evanspitt in the morning and have a look around , then stop at Schlitz 's old stand . People said there was a brand-new management in the place again . No telling when Mollie would ' phone though . He would have to stick around and hold his voice pretty steady . Mark came of fine people . He , too , was a brave , democratic gentleman . William Winlock had been James 's first and for a long time his only real friend among the " haves . " Now his son could be trusted on his wedding night . He and William had painted boats at Mark 's Own . Winlocks never foozled anything , once they made up their minds . They never had to think and think how things are usually done , like the dumb who deserted a shack and shut themselves up in a palace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poxy title . No , sir , not with a fella like him parked in the front yard . Once in his bitterness he had sworn to buy a presentation for her at court and the hell of a title . What a fool ! How kind God had been . He 'd had some narrow shaves in the mine , but he had had his mother , then Jennie for all his life that mattered , and now Mollie to go on . She 'd never know want ; she could spend and give away , then give away some more . And he had got to the place where nobody could sneer at him and snub him . Hardly seemed worth while to have filed so many affidavits against Arch Sewell 's crooked ways all these years . What was the use ? Who cared ? He did n't come to the wedding . Good ! William Winlock loved Mollie , too , treated her like his own very special daughter since the day he 'd known Mark was going to marry her . Now she was away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself as often as he liked . Nobody any better than a Winlock . Mollie Evans Winlock  --  that fella could be trusted his wedding night  --  too considerate , if anything . Took a long long time to turn out people like that , generations . . . rare as pure carbon in the Red Ash . Most of us are like bituminous , he thought , or cold and useless as slate . Hell , some in New Hartford . . . life could n't make even smolder .... Just good to grind under and lay on roads for the living to pass by . . . . No pitch , no strike , no structure . . . . He looked at the portrait of his wife long  | and long until the eyes seemed almost to speak . . . . His driven , wild thoughts slowed . He sighed . In life , Jennie had been like the first drink of clear water after you 'd been caught twelve hours in a dusty seam without one drop . Yes , she was lovely as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . . . Jennie . Mollie had said her first son would be named James . He had said , " Pshaw . No . " She must have been fooling . Sally would marry and name her son after her own father , but of course her last name would no longer be Winlock . James or William , what did it matter ? Hell . . . wedding  --  glory enough for one day . Pesky old Freeman who had almost scared him to death before this great day . There was no sign of life in the Evans mansion till eight next morning . Everybody was asleep . Then George and the chambermaid pulled up the shades . Outside men in mattress-cloth suits were unhinging and taking down the awninged tunnel that led to the entrance . Mollie telephoned at ten and ordered her father not to be wakened . No one even knocked on the master 's door till noon . There was no answer . They peered in . No one was there . No one had slept in the turned down bed . Consternation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . running feet . They found him in a storeroom on the third floor . He had knelt before a battered trunk from the old country . Things were scattered about as though he had searched in wild haste . His face was sunk down against a plaid shawl , the kind the miners ' wives used to wear in the old days  --  Jennie 's . Dr. Freeman said he must have died early that morning .  | Chapter VI : Escape 1914-1915 April 12 SALLY and her English husband stood at the source of Stony Creek . It course down Shawnee along the meadow of Mark 's Own . Beyond Coldspring , its pools were blackened by the sediment long settled against the tiered ridges of the rocks . Beside her stood David Rockford , tall , blond , his face tanned a deep leather . After Oxford , he had gone into the colonial service in the Orient . " Is n't it queer , to come upon this unspoiled spot when we are just out of hearing of the pumps ? " said Sally . " On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can still hear them . " " You wo n't mind leaving it all too much ? You meant what you said the first day of the second month we were married ? " " What was that ? " " Everything I thought I thought , I do not think now . Everything I felt I was , I am not . ' Why did you say that ? " he said , searching her face . " Because my new calling card was just the tombstone of that Sally Winlock . I 'm glad  --  glad  --  glad to be leaving this valley . No more Sally , no more . . . . Want to know who there is now ? " " Who ? " " Mrs. David Hugh , a new creature with no end of unexpected gumption . By marrying an Englishman  --  even though the English supposedly remain reserved until death  --  I have become bold , happy , ruthless . I never knew love could be such a laughing matter . "  | " Old ties do not cause quite the same feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The  --  the  --  man you told me of ? " " Oh , well , always I shall love him a little , but even that is not what I thought . I would n't like to be where I had to see him too often . It might come alive again , all that torrent pent-to-bursting that I let collect over too many years . But it ca n't have been as it seemed . All I wanted ever was you . I ca n't believe my luck . I could n't have depended on Luke . He could n't even depend on himself . The British Empire has depended on you so long and on your people . You ca n't talk like Luke  --  all around the moon on any subject  --  but  --  but one thing I 've discovered : talking is not important . So many times , it 's in the way . " The whistles blew one after another over the valley . " Now let 's go down , " Sally said . " Grandma would have had tea made for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be ! Grandpa must have drunk really gallons of coffee . . . but I never saw him . I remember her so well . She does not seem dead , even now . " In the library , with the lamps lighted , they sat close together . They were sailing the following night , and there was no telling when they would come back to the valley . " Grandma was old , old , " Sally said . " She died in 1902 during the great strike . She used to look at me . Her eyes said , You are my namesake . ' " Sally was radiant now , her eyes bright , her color high , her laugh easier and more frequent . She felt life had just begun ; all that came before had been schooling . " If she had seen you , Gran would have felt just one pang that she was n't my age , and you Mark Stone . She would evaluate you more nearly as your character is entered in the Book of Judgment than anyone else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , English blood , distilled through the hardships , struggles , wars and massacres of the Wyoming Valley , is the equal of any on earth . Maybe they 'll try to tell you how to fix your hair over there if you ever go . Do n't listen . ' " Then she would turn to you and say , Alas , Sally is weak like me , David Hugh . We like trouble . We take on so much that is not our business and that we have no power to remedy . Her  | brother will have to carry the mine . I am glad , I am rejoiced that she goes away from this valley . Women who try to cure or even manage the world , lose their teeth early . ' Grandma once said just that  --  I remember . She would say to you , They usually die old maids . The human heart is full of deceit , Mr. Rockford . We take on these burdens of a mysterious Providence .

In the latter end , one 's plans for the doing of good seem pretentious as an afternoon tea . ' Not this type of tea , David . I have her diary . She wrote things like that ! All that is necessary will be provided . Here in this valley , children lack the food to give them adequate bones . Sally 's own bones could have been better as a child . Cripples haunt us both . ' Of necessity she talked of me and not you , sir , because she never had the pleasure of meeting you . She prayed earnestly that I would not be an old maid . " Their tea cups were empty . He drew her down onto the narrow , haircloth sofa with its hard back . The coal in the grate burned without sound . IIe rested his face against her hair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red hair is bad luck ? " she said . " It must be because it makes them forget everything else . " " Did n't you know it meant temper , too ? " " Tempered metal . " " I like blond hair best , know why ? " Her hand felt for his head . The fire burned . Lincolnshire , June , 1914 Sally looked over the velvet sward clipped and tended for more than two hundred years . An automatic grass-cutter made the only sound . Beyond the formal gardens of modeled yew and box lay tufted meadow and quiet waters . David was at the Foreign Office , and expecting an appointment soon . Through these lonely weeks of waiting in England , her heart had grown long roots and tendrils  | into Rockford soil . Many times , to herself she had said , " This is going to be my country , so I can be excused for loving it so much . Long ago , my people were not so many miles away . These little hills are dearer than they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then suddenly it seemed as though David , their life together , and a future somewhere in the British consular service were a phantasmagoria and would vanish with a clap of thunder . Through the perfect midsummer afternoon , beyond the laden tea table , the clink of silver on porcelain , the up-and-down of beautiful English voices , had come the thought of her long-dead grandmother taking off her flannel petticoat while the Coldspring blizzard shrieked down the side of Shawnee . Janet , who had always broken up abruptly the lovely imaginary games through her childhood , would have said , " Live each day as it comes . Do n't think of what 's lost and over , nor what 's yet to come . " She looked once more into the ancient English garden . It had been there a long time . Who was she to doubt its continuance for another century ? One day followed another , like jewels on a necklace . Then the lightning struck England . There was tension at the dinner table . David 's father sat gazing blankly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butler had curiously enough failed to fill in . An Archduke and Duchess had been shot in the Balkans . No one knew what would happen to all of Europe . The whistles of the Coldspring were blowing all alone . Turkey Bill . Culmtown . Tiger Hollow . Evanspitt and then a chorus of all the others joined in . Now the deafening roar bowled round and round the valley 's rim ; then one by one , as of old , it ceased . The hoarse steady croak of Evanspitt left off . The level plaint of Tiger Hollow . The spurious tremolo of Culmtown . The steady scream from Turkey Bill . Now there was left , just at the ear 's last capacity to hear , the  | high note of the rising siren of the Coldspring as it wavered once more into silence . Sally opened her eyes . Above her hung the ancient red silk valance of the great carved bedstead . She turned her eyes toward the light . Panels of the great leaded window stood open . Outside lay Rockford Ashe , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meadow where stood the short-horned cattle . Her hand touched the shoulder of her sleeping husband . He did not move . Suddenly she came awake . She raised herself on her elbow , the better to see his face  --  his rumpled hair , his cheek , his mouth . Her eyes devoured him as though she looked at a script of something to be committed to memory . His sleep was light and quiet like a child 's . Even his night 's yellow stubble of beard did not prevent him from seeming defenseless , unconscious of her and her look . She kissed him . " Our day , " she whispered . " Our day . " Not quite aware of life , his forehead puckered , his mouth still insecure like a disturbed child 's . Then all of a sudden he awoke . He pressed her till it hurt . She whispered gently , " Nothing matters . . . nothing . The war , the world , living or dying  --  we 've had it all . " " Know what I thought ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a machine gun . " " Know what I dreamed I heard just as I wakened ? " " What ? " " The whistles in the mines at home . " " Do n't say home . ' " " Penn-syl-van-i-ay then . When I was little and the whistles would blow I 'd always say to myself , Here , ' just as we answered when they called the roll in school . " " You 're here now , " he said , closing in again . " That 's the hell of a note . You 'll be here till you die . We 'll have a joke on everything yet . Years and years . Let the whistles blow . You wo n't be there . " " I just meant another day 's beginning , that was all . " " You called America home , ' when it 's bad enough leaving you in England . " Sally lay silent , her hand against his heart .  | Light of day enclosed them . ' Words were necessary in daylight . Words were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time opaque as bricks walling them into their separate selves . The moments before he wakened it was as though they had achieved death together . No separation . Love outside of time . Matchless moment , stored safe on this side of the bolted door of separation , which would be beaten with the knuckles of their longing in the days to come . October Dinner was over at Rockford Ashe . David , his father , and their cousin , Egbert Stewart , turned just as usual at the paneled door and went back to the table as though there were no war . Sally , with his aunt , went to the drawing room . So old and so transparent , with her little chattering remarks , Aunt Margaret was like a very weak bird . She had only acceptance left  --  and her pearls , a sumptuous rope around her failing , emaciated neck . These burned and glowed like a harvest moon against the midnight blue of her virginal silk . Sally had put on an apricot taffeta , with yards of lace ruffles  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rockford , the only son of David 's younger brother , went to bed , being aged eight . His father was " somewhere " in France , too . In due time they would know at what sector . The boy 's mother , Adelaide , was a driver in the motor transport auxiliary of the Fifth Brigade . Robert 's father had been in the Scots Greys for ten years . He was a captain . They kept saying that . If a captain could n't know enough to take care of things , himself included , who could ? David had been in India , and now was a second lieutenant with the Fourth Lincolns , encamped near Totnes in Devon . All leaves were called by noon of the following day  --  eighteen hours yet . Then there would suddenly be no Fourth Lincolns , not a word , not a breath , not a hint in the local paper , or the Totnes sheet , or the London Times which came for Sally , or the Mail , for time without mind the paper of Rockford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea would , as they put their pence on the counters of shops in the nearest village , wag  | their heads and look wise  --  as though camions on their way to the coast , in the night and through the hours before dawn , did not make as much noise as artillery fire , echoing through the fullblown hedgerows and lanes of Devon . There the poppies and the daisies had patterned the meadows through June , as the daylight lingered till after nine of an evening , and the salmon leaped in the Darte . She and David had had their first week in England there in the little Rockford fishing cabin on a wooded stream whose riparian rights had descended to the Rockfords through some failure of issue somewhere . There the leaves lay thick and untouched as in an uncharted forest in some distant colony . The white convex face of the clock set into the stone hood of the fireplace was tolling off the seconds . Now it struck nine . Its hands of gilded bronze looked far too ornate to point the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel pointers for clocks in the years of war . The strokes made Sally think now of the light but inexorable tap-tap of the hammer that fastened down coffin lids back in New Hartford in the state of Pennsylvania . " Time " ? tap ? " and the hour " ? tap ? " run through the longest day " ? tap ? " and the shortest of nights " ? tap  --  tap , tap , tap , tap . Nine already , and a night is as a thousand years . Sally stiffened to prevent the shiver that she felt , but Aunt Margaret , now safe and free of desire , leaned over and laid the golden gauze scarf around her shoulders with those tremulous blue-veined hands . David was her favorite nephew . Apparently at the end the winds of time swept away the fogs and very old people noted even slight deviations in the comforts of others . " Aunt Margaret , Aunt Margaret , thank you so very , very much , " said the Honorable Sara Winlock Rockford . " You must take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between them creaked and grew brittle . " I 'm very fond of you in spite of your being only an American , my dear . There must be good blood behind you somewhere . I 've said it again and again . " " The records say my ancestors at Scrooby were not included with the county families , hereabouts . My father 's people were Scotch-Irish from Coleraine . The Stones made guns for all the wars for one hundred years , Aunt Margaret . But tonight some  | way , ancestors seem to me the lucky ones , with things all over . " She was laughing strained , treble laughter . " England is England , and I suppose they would not get over it , if I went to the door and poked my head in and said , Time to join the ladies , ' would they ? " " My dear , I am sure that would be quite wrong . There is a great strength about convention , it supports through  --  through almost everything . " Sally had a strange flashback to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some strength beyond themselves too , but it had not been the man-wrought nets of convention . " May the peace which passeth understanding . . . perfect love casteth out fear . . . God is love . . . " What a strange world , when virulent psalms , lately unearthed , echoed at noon each day from the very ancient altar of the Norman church at Rockford Ashe . " God confound our knavish enemies . " But she had been up the Rhine at seventeen and she had loved the German people . She sighed . " It is only an old race , " Aunt Margaret went on , " which realizes the vast reservoir of strength to be had from the performance of ritual , and possibly one has to be born part of the British tradition to understand how it does enable men to go out and women to live on , alone . A widow , my dear , at long last  --  well , she has had something . My fiance lost his life in India in border trouble that never got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proper perspective on one 's own losses . " " What was he like ? " " I can show you a miniature tomorrow . It came back on the ship on which he had expected to return home . He had had it done for me . " " Forever wilt thou love and she be fair , " thought Sally , but she said merely , " Oh . " " For women with Titian hair like yours , my dear , life is never over . Your hair makes even the very old , like me , forget the war . And do you mind telling me , since we have suddenly got so intimate , who taught you to walk ? You are the only American I have seen who moves like a swan . I thought the secret of it had gone out with the Austrian court . " " Do you really want to know ? "  | " Yes . " " I learned it in an orthopedic hospital after I had been there on a board for quite a time . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I had a little accident when I was very young . " " How young ? " " Pretty young . Anyway , it gave me a little trouble that is all over now . " " Yes , " said Aunt Margaret in a gentle absent-minded voice , purged of life once more , clear and cool after that sharp , immediate thought in regard to Sally 's unborn child . Aunt Margaret 's years insured that her last summons would be met with the same form that an engraved invitation to the King 's garden party required . She would not fail . The heavy door sounded now . No mistake . The men 's steps rang along the glassy floor which could hold no imprint of their feet , not even of the nails in infantry boots . This was October . Sally 's child would be born in April . David would hope for another leave then , but they could not count on it . Now he sat down on the opposite divan by his aunt , talking to her about her garden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brittle , useless way . They both might just as well have been chattering like the birds in the court , before feeding time . Both Sally and his father were equally taut about his leaving . His father was on the Food Control Board and worked after hours every day . His heart was not so good , people said . " British Empire , British Empire , British Empire . " Sally said the words to herself . They cast no spell , contained no anodyne , but sounded empty with less and less meaning . After just exactly six minutes , no more , no less , David said , " I think , as I have a little packing , I 'll go up if I may . Good night . " He bent over his Aunt Margaret 's shaking , ringless hand . Then with just a touch on his father 's shoulder , he took Sally 's arm and they walked back , clicking over that teak floor hard as . . . as British morale , to the great stairway where the Siamese gong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and though it was not loud , it would echo all the way through the park to the walled garden in the valley .  | In the morning , they drank their tea and walked out along the terrace toward the garden . The dew still laid a frost-like glamour on every leaf and autumn flower . If Sally lived to be a thousand , she would not forget the shade and slant of the burning blue flowers in the jars that stood at every flight of steps . Train time . . . David went . The weeks dragged by . Rain beat on the high mullioned windows beside which Sally , grown ridiculously clumsy now , sat in David 's fishing sweater . At the opening gun of this new game in which she was involved , she had sent material from London to Annie Rattigan of New I-Iartford , Pennsylvania , with sketches , and in good time received back a white voile Greek gown , banded in gold , and a king blue dress with cloth of gold lining in the sleeves . She would continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able or even a little longer . David 's father , with the unique strength of his race and his capacious and disciplined mind , worked happily day and night over tons of bacon and barrels of yeast . Yes , barrels . . . . If you had ten men who ate sixty pigs  --  they did problems like that back in the New Hartford Academy  --  how many would you eat if you were n't pregnant and there was no war ? There was one question in algebra that had never been asked .. . and she never asked it . By the tenth of March , sitting by the window in David 's fishing sweater no longer seemed feasible . She had herself driven to the telegraph office at Grantham and wired Janet  --  well , even if her mother had been alive it would have still been for Janet . You became childish when you were having a child , alone . " Need you now . Cable collect . Call on Father for expenses . " At midnight the answer came . " Diabetes , flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not sent collect . She looked at the three sorries . Janet was Scotch . It meant a great deal . With her empty tea tray next morning she sent down word of a technical withdrawal . As she lay looking at the ancient mellow chintz at the windows , full of a Rubens-like wealth of figures and a light that never was in war or even peace , a light tap sounded . Then , incredibly , her hands held a penciled letter from him . That sensitive , minute handwriting was still etched and steady after so many weaks of bombardment .  | Perhaps , just perhaps , God had a huge surprise , and he would be one of the ones to come through . Sometimes . . . sometimes . . . but her pattern was failure . No one knew that better than she . Still , she could go right on making all the motions all the time , and then perhaps their child would be one of those hearty little optimists who would shed the occult threats that echo in the upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most closely bolted shutters . She read : " BELOVED , " Here is a dried flower . It is not everyone out here who is so thoughtful of his bride , and yesterday I sent you another present . This was once a Belgian park . The enameled sign off the blackened tree above my dugout bears the words , Ater dasycar pum , ' and a little map of the United States with red streaks where it is indigenous along the Atlantic seaboard . It looks to me like New Hartford , though that is not on this map . Ought to be , on my tree . Now , lest you feel I should not have removed this without permission of the park authorities , let me assure you , Puritan Princess with that granite streak , that I did not steal it . It fell down . " Take it easier than any American has ever learned to take anything , and know you are never far from me . I can see you at all hours of the day and night , with the light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the apricot vine . " At the end were his initials and six little crosses . Then below that he had written : " We have had all there is . " There were no more letters . In due and decorous language the War Office announced him among the missing , and then officially dead . It left scarcely four weeks in which she had to hold on , not think , not grieve . Then there might be his child , perhaps with his eyes or some look of him , some gesture . She bought no mourning and continually wore his old sweater , except to dinner when she put on the white dress . She sent beautiful flowers , but begged to be excused from his memorial service . It took someone bred in the tradition . If she had been  | a real Rockford she could have gone . She would have known that even without the crestfallen looks of his family . " Set me as a seal upon thine heart , as a seal upon thine arm . " She could not explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scripture which poured in upon her and swept her from all moorings of the world and obligation . " My beloved is mine and I am his . . . . He feedeth his flocks among the lilies . " Among the lilies  --  amid offal of the trenches . The first letter that came from camp was more Song of Songs than even she knew , and she could recite more than Hebrew youth was allowed to hear for centuries . That had been her Magna Charta , setting her free at last from Luke 's desertion . All her youth was no more than a dream . David was her life . She was his . They were one . Now she had her valise packed . She wrote a brief , affectionate note to her father-in-law and told him that she could be found at Mrs. Young 's Nursing Home , 27 The Boltons , Southwest London . There from the high , hard bed in the nun-like room she told Mrs. Young to buy a small secondhand phonograph and to get all the records of the music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Young was curious . Harrod had been American ? ? Really ? ? No , Bach was not an American . Well , better not go into that . After waiting two days , they brought seven records . Among them were " Good News from Heaven , " from Sleepers , Wake ; " Jesus Joy of Man 's Desiring " ; " Jubilate , " and the others from the B-Minor Mass . She was not strong enough yet to risk those . Things went surprisingly well for three days . She even slept some . Then David 's father with two lawyers came with his will . It had to be proved in her presence or something strange . They had a letter written the day after his last to her , just a line : " Sorry about Aunt Margaret " ? she had died as unobtrusively as she had lived ? " Please give Sally the pearls . " Her father-in-law handed her the worn green velvet case . His sister Margaret , he explained , had been fond of her , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English , now . He was trying his best to be a help . Then they unwrapped the long thing they were carrying . It was David 's dress sword , sent from Paris , addressed to her in care of his father . It was mentioned also in his will . He had so  | little to bequeath in a will . If only , if only they could have left her alone with Bach  --  with her battle just ahead . At seven minutes past eleven that night she sat bolt upright , roused from troubled and induced sleep . The night echoed with the vast dissonance of whistles blowing . At twelve noon next day , a few minutes before the morning whistles at home sounded for the day 's work , her child was born and lived less than one hour . At the nursing home in London , Sally was sitting up in a chair for the first time . The crackling middle-aged nurse with the serviceable swarthy skin tucked a blanket around her feet just as any grocery clerk might fold over the ends of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The feet of Sara Winlock Rockford , who had lost hold , and lost her child , and lost and lost , were no different from millions of other feet , marching feet by hundred thousands , tired feet , frozen feet , high-heeled feet , lazy , vicious feet , and  --  and small dead feet . That her own would not bear her and that if they could , she herself would not know where to direct them , did not matter . Here at last was a wisp of certainty  --  twenty minutes by her watch sitting up in a chair . This moment was like the tallest alder twig which trembled above the Susquehanna at spring flood on the western bank . In time the waters receding left a low hedge of branches above the folding , mobile surface . In time the mudcovered trees themselves appeared , with the flood wrack in grotesque spots , like the veriest caricatures of Christmas trees . All the trees were filled with trash , but the waters were coming back to their right limits and reason . She heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra . Drive on at Ypres . " The boy said " Wipers . " The corners of her mouth moved in the same directions which had formerly made a smile . At that moment she looked curiously like her Grandmother Winlock in the hour she sat by her husband after his death until the morning laid gray squares of the dawn on the walls at Mark 's Own . The doctor came next morning . " You will be going home , soon . " She looked bewildered . " I 'll go a long way from here . Home ? " she said .  | " Where will you go ? " " I think on a journey to the East . " " There are enemy submarines , you know . And war has upset the East . " " Not so much as it has me . I 'll go to the New Hebrides . " " Why ? " The doctor was carefully measuring out white powder and leaving it in precise pyramids on white squares of paper . " Oh , I always liked that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " " Well , it 's no place to go now , " he said . She tried again . " When I was eleven , it took me a whole winter to commit to memory the Catechism  --  the Westminster . I was paid thirty dollars . I left it on the pillow of Dr. Peyton , a missionary to the head-hunters . I could go now to see if they have invested the interest in the same foundation or done something entirely contrary to international or banking laws . Possibly they 've squandered it on condiments for the tastiest heads . Maybe they like red-heads . " The doctor did not reply . " Why does n't the government here demand that widows without children take poison the first week ? " Here the doctor looked annoyed , and went back to his medicine case to examine the bottle . " Moses was a great man , " she said . " He said a man need not go to war nor to work for the first year of marriage . He was to stay home and comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth fighting for . Of course , I might be blown up on the way out to the East . It would save the head-hunters a lot of . . . " She noticed now that the doctor was not listening . He looked worn . " Here are your powders . Good-by , Mrs. Rockford , " he said , without once taking in who she was . At the door , with a second 's return of recognition , he murmured , " We all have our worries . " That night Sally overheard two nurses talking in the corridor . " Yes , doctor did seem fagged , " one of them said . " Did n't you know ? " asked the other . " His only son was listed this morning among the missing . . . last seen a week ago . " He had made his visit at the usual time . Sally lay quiet , with every word of her cheap irony burning on the ceiling like Broadway signs . Irony was the refuge of the mean and the cowardly .  | The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but everyone 's eyes asked , " How long do you believe that England can spare a hospital bed , even in a private nursing home , to a mere woman who has lost a child ? " Every day the words , very dim at first , came out clear and clearer on the gray plaster wall : " What are you going to do now ? " They brought her folders from the steamship offices about trips to parts of the world where the intervening waters were still open to ships and the lands beyond scarcely less miserable than formerly . There was romantic India with its bazaars and scents and an annual income of something like thirty-six dollars a year , per capita . She might go to see the temples of the Nile , but they were probably all bristling with bayonets to guard them from explosions and sabotage . The Japanese were a wonderful little people . She could go to Japan and sit under pink blossoms . No , if she chose to travel , it would be one of those furious journeys where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp points on all sorts of unexpected promontories , rocks in the sea , prows as they turned in their courses , stacks receding against the sky . It would take no more than a heavy needle , if you pressed hard enough , to sever first one artery at the wrist and then the other , and then would come easeful slow dripping death . No more hard gray lights of dawn , no more gathering nights to weigh down the lonely heart and suffocate its lone beat . She could leave just one scribbled line to her father to forgive  --  that he might care enough to understand that she could not go on now . The nurse spoke from somewhere . Evidently she had been sitting in the room , although there had been no crackling of her starched clothes . " The Honorable Adelaide inquired for you and left a message . " " What message ? " " She said she thought now you might be willing to let her take your necklace and put it in a safety box at Barclay 's Bank . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it here . The hospital can not take responsibility . You have read the rules . " She pressed the central pearl hard against her breastbone until it hurt . She heard her voice say :  | " I am not afraid . Nothing is going to happen to me . In times like these , when life keeps disappearing , property stays where you put it . I keep mine and I die a long way from here . " The nurse did not answer . She just sat there , phlegmatic , yet sphinx-like . " And I even know what you are thinking , " Sally went on . The nurse turned . " You are thinking that Americans are vulgar , because they say what they think , often . But George the Third discovered , after paying out plenty for good Hessians , that they had their points . And I might as well say that when you sit here , I prefer you never to toy with my nail file . " Suddenly she leaned forward and with hands that shook , she began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Bible won in Sunday school . She opened the small bruised volume at random . She needed a message , direct . She pushed the open page much farther from her eyes . Eyes like Sally 's , if they did not cry soon , would not be able to see at all . The words took form , " Sing , 0 barren , thou that didst not bear . " Something wet , longed for , almost miraculous , rose in her eyes now . The first tears since her child 's death made the words blur . She wiped the tears from her hands . Suddenly she swallowed along her atrophied throat . Now , where were those words ? " Enlarge the place of thy tent , and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations . . . lengthen thy cords , and strengthen thy stakes . . . . For thy Maker is thine husband . " Her eyes blurred again . Leaning forward now she fumbled in the drawer for a handkerchief . " Thy Redeemer , the Holy One of Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman forsaken and grieved . . . and a wife of youth .... " Tears came like rain on frozen ground . There was a knock . It was her tea . There was the toast . She reached for that instead of the cup . It had just a trace of flavor , the first thing that had had any flavor . When she finished , she turned her face toward the wall . Blank gray had few connotations or bells that could echo into the past .  | Of course the Bible had fallen open at the 54th Chapter of Isaiah . It was on the same page as the 53rd , and that chapter had taken her longer than any other she had ever learned by heart . It had been just a string of words that meant nothing  --  highfalutin prophecy . Tomorrow she would read it and see what it meant now . It was only a coincidence of course , and yet . . . voiceless words emanated from the insentient plaster . She put her hand against it . It was hard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sing , 0 barren ... Thy Maker is thine husband . . . a woman forsaken . . . wife of youth .... " The excruciating pain over her heart became less . One breath and then another came , without that scraping pain of gravel on raw flesh that breathing had been since her child died . It had also been somewhat difficult to breathe for the month of waiting , between the death of her husband and the birth of her son . Outside still evening had come down . The regular thud of troops moved east along some distant highway . At home the whistles had blown . The men 's boots ceased tapping along the cinders of the clearing and then down the hill , each to his home in Coldspring  --  so far from this our war . Her father had come in at the side door . His cane had clicked into the pan at the bottom of the hatrack . Through the door into the back hall came the odor of steak and potatoes frying . There was a rice pudding cooling on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alone by the fire . Her place was empty . She would go home . What a fool she was , how blind not to know that was the only place in the whole crazed and senseless world where life could still go on for her . A letter from Janet was handed her as she left the tender at Plymouth . Behind her , that isle " set in a silver sea " diminished . The Hoe , where Drake and his men bowled on the green between forays , disappeared even for eyes which looked back . She read and reread : " I do n't know whether you knew Martha 's nephew George was made assistant fire-boss . My nephew Joseph is coming home for vacation . He 's at Pittsburgh where he got a scholarship to be an engineer . His mother says  | it is only because he is good at football . His brains are only fair , she says . It seemed to me too far to have him go . He felt he had a better chance in that line there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is so high flown he says he is going to be an entomologist . Catherine has a breaking out and suffers a great deal . "  | Chapter VII : The Return 1915 SARA WINLOCK ROCKFORD neared the cut in the wall of mountains from which she would see once more the Wyoming Valley . The train slowed for the curve and the grade . Before her , in its own dream , lay the valley . The shadows of great violet-based clouds made dark islands across the little knolls and undulations which rippled down the valley floor . The train descended along the ridge . Everywhere the white smoke , more alive than ostrich feathers , rose from the collieries . Here was a presentation on a giant scale , a continual pageant for the benefit of a theatrical-looking and mascara-lidded lady called Progress , and for an English widow , stealing home again . " Your face so far , from this our war , " David had quoted in a letter even when she was in England , and he still as near as the Ypres salient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun . Everything changed . Not many would bother , but some would remember that Luke had walked out on her and would not realize that to her it no longer mattered . Her husband was dead . His only son had also died . New Hartford in general would realize it was better that she had not been burdened with an English manor and the ritualistic social obligations . They would feel very sure that all that would have bored Sally Winlock . Her father , looking much grayer even in the first flash , was standing , gazing up through the car windows , as the train pulled in . She recognized the gabled station with colored tile entrance , the old smell of hurry and luggage . The same old bawled lists of  | stations still to come  --  Wilkes-Barre , Pittsville , Scranton , Carbondale  --  and the deafening sound of escaping steam assaulted her ears . She saw the white cloud of steam in the selfsame place where she and Luke had realized each other 's presence in Eden . When they reached the big house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the side hall , her father holding her arm . They went into the library . She looked around . She placed her stool by her father 's chair and sat down as though she were still ten years old . Celestine had died so long ago ; David had died ; their child , William 's grandson , had died . She and her father had only each other . She took his hand . " William , " she said , as though they were the same age now . " William . " He touched her hair , almost as though he might be rebuffed . " Your hair , " he said , " your hair . " That was all . Then he added , " You were always the sunlight of this house . . . . " At last , in a coruscated voice , she whispered : " There 's no hour or day I could spare or be without . . . .

" He had been , " she answered . " I saw his emptied bottle . .. . Just the same , drunk and blind or both , what he said was encouraging . I almost said , Sir , I was born under a conjunction of Venus and Mars , ' but I did n't . " Sally had sat in her mother 's former place for six months now , at the head of her father 's table .

After the London nursing home , she understood that if thinking of her helped a man at the front , he must think . But this morning she did not open his letter . " Are n't you going to pour my coffee ? " asked her father .  | " Of course , " he said . She poured cream , put one piece of sugar into the blue Dresden cup .

" Arch is in a hurry , is n't he ? " he said . " Perhaps circumstances over which he has no control may have made this somewhat unseemly haste necessary . Going ? You need n't feel you ought to go . " " I ca n't say . Are you ? " He shook his head . " If your mother were here  --  it would be different . I suppose I 'd go then . " " You never liked any Sewell , did you ? " she asked . " Never , except your grandmother , and she only married one . Time may come . Lots survive war . By no means everybody gets killed . Luke 's got pretty fine stuff in him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtfully at the long fronds of the ferns in the morning sun . " Luke 's no good , " he went on . " Always said so . Still he has his points . I 'd rather see you throw yourself away on him , for instance ? " She interrupted . " It must seem strange for me to say that I do not expect him back . I write as though he would come . Could anyone with even part of a heart do less ? Right now , even if he were here , Father , I should n't want to marry him . But I need not even think of that now . In so short a space , how could another man than Luke have been anything to me , for a longer life than I may care to live ? But it seems that way . I have had it  --  it is over . David took Luke 's place . Now Luke can not take his . Can I  | consider David dead , when I live in his presence , not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him . " " Marriage is a powerful thing , " he answered . " Do those who marry twice ever know what it is ? " " Sally , the Winlocks are too dog-gone intense about everything , but time changes even us . Give us time , that 's all . God forbid that a few months of marriage should keep you a widow for the rest of your days . " The New Cemetery exceeded the Settlers ' in power and glory . It had stone posts , iron gates , a gatehouse , landscaped lots and roads . The Archibald Sewell lot was on an imposing promontory over the lowlands by the river . At two o'clock a small group stood huddled on the manicured greensward . The silence and the service were ticked off by the pumps of the Dennison Mine , the crest of which , soaring from river level , loomed over the hedges . The Reverend Vibert Payer , an itinerant home missionary whom Archibald Sewell " gave " to the Wyoming Valley in memory of his father , stood obediently at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Culmtown Mine , was at Arch 's right . Sally had not seen Bevan for five years . In one flash she now understood : within his stooped frame beyond his hideous mole burned the blue flame of the power in Wales  --  Erbyn Y Brd ? " the duty of all men is to seek truth and receive it against the world " ? he held his own without question against Archibald Sewell 's physical perfection . In Bevan 's brave opaque eyes , the rims always red in his waxen face , she felt the solvent powers of duty . Several of the newcomers in New Hartford , flattered into attendance by Arch 's telegrams , stood amiably by , like a lump of non-conducting matter between conveyors . Mark had decreed that Mollie should not go , so Sally was alone . She stood in the outer circle , in white  --  she had worn only black or white since her return . She was numb with detachment and a mild curiosity , even slightly bored . By all rights she should have been grinding her teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still alive , fighting in France with an Indian regiment , writing , cabling , sending flowers just as though time could be turned back . But they were separated by a chasm deeper  | than the ocean that lay between . She had married a man with capacities which Luke would not know . She , who thought she had already given all to the man who had rejected her , had gone like a stripped suppliant to her marriage and had awaked only to learn that she had known nothing . Now , " he " and his child  --  were gone . She still had her father , who needed her . Archibald Sewell 's splurge was a curious exploitation of death itself . With a grandiose gesture he was about to unveil a stone monument above the urn of Beatrice 's ashes . Sally 's eyes stared unfocused and unseeing past the swathed sculpture , into the high privet which discreetly hid the outcrops and sloping stony soil , where another cemetery lay . There , just over the high hedge and higher iron fence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contours of the land . There , the graves bore rain-beaten offerings of draggled immortelles with here and there a bright geranium , matter-of-fact and kind , like Mollie . As she gazed at the privet , Sally was realizing the view on the other side  --  stony ground , knolls , cliffs and swales of coal country . It was all there was for the dead from the Dennison Mine which raised its soaring height from the deep ravine , its black waters gushing into the clear rills of Laurel Creek , only fifty yards from the point where it joined the broad reaches of the Susquehanna . In the cemetery now , the unveiling of the stone figure was begun . The canvas , with a scuffling sound , was taken down . There stood an angel ; but for those who had buried their dead , it was a Pieta . Her head was sunk onto her left arm . Iler wings were small and did not deprive her of humanity . The work of the second most expensive sculptor in America had retained something of the granite-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she realized that from the other side of the hedge the figure must appear to be a monument to the dead of the Dennison Mine . After the passages of Scriptures had been read , and prayers had quavered from the feeble throat of the reverend himself , who was a living memorial to the hatred borne Matthew by his son , the synthetically assembled audience melted . Sally walked toward the gate and her parked car which she had p 391 chosen to drive herself . There was something of a " still very able to get about by myself thank you " in this trip without the chauffeur . A hand suddenly laid on her shoulder made her recoil . It was her uncle . " My own very dear . . . " Her first name eluded him now . She filled the gap and said , " Uncle Arch . " She took his hand . She had not seen him since her return from England , the death of her husband , the loss of her child . It was possible that he did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She hoped he did not know of her loss , so that he could not make any parallel with his own and speak of it with eloquence and unction . " Come down to the ladies ' wing of the club , S  --  Sally . " His triumph at remembering her name changed the timbre in his voice and he seemed to feel better . " I need a drink . It 's been a hard time , but do n't you think it 's been worth what she cost ? " She hesitated , bewildered . He turned and surveyed the sculpture . Death was his enemy . Those who died , had deserted him . IIe would no longer think of Beatrice , but only of the success of his statue . " It 's remarkably beautiful , Uncle Arch  --  very , " Sally said . " You have done something for all of us  --  putting it here in the valley . " " Say ! Now I think of it  --  mighty nice of you to come . Mighty nice . Sometimes love 's like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  nobody 's to blame  --  nobody can help  --  like an explosion in a mine . If it goes off and hits somebody else  --  why  --  no harm intended . Come , let 's have a drink and let bygones be bygones . " They went to the club . At length they said good-by . As Sally was leaving , her uncle detained her for a moment . " Oh , say , Sal , you wo n't believe it , but I forgot your married name . Just what is it ? " " Rockford ? " " Mrs. What Rockford ? " " David . " " Ai n't it The Honorable ' ? " " Yes . " " Nobody tryin ' to fool me then . "  | " No . Good-by , Uncle Arch . " " Do n't ever know what became of that fella  --  Beatrice was chucking him anyway , if she 'd lived . Love is like a mine explosion  --  destroys everybody around  --  and biff ! fans force air through the workings and not a trace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What could be done , I did . I have no regrets . Trained nurses , specialists ' latest equipment , oxygen  --  money was n't spared . Want to guess how much that angel cost ? It 'd take your breath away . " " How much ? " said Sally . " Tell me . " She was grateful not to have to think of Luke for a little while . The day after Beatrice Sewell 's monument was unveiled and the newspapers had turned elsewhere for news , Jacob Czarka climbed the steep hill by the Dennison Mine . A voice within him kept crying , " My enemy is broken . His daughter is dead . " Catherine had said sternly , " You sin , when God has spared to us our daughter , Jeanie . " When a Scotchwoman became a Catholic , he thought now , she kept enough Presbyterianism to crash about in her new allegiance and trample upon everything around her . Catherine was all fire and iron , and the great Jacob Czarka was bankrupt and trembling before her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the hill , he met Father Finnigan on his way down . The old man paused and the two shook hands . They stepped from the uneven , narrow sidewalk into the near-by cemetery where the men of the Dennison lay . Father Finnigan spoke first . " Jacob , my son , " he said slowly , " in you the boy Joseph , beloved of Culmtown , lives again . I was thinking of him . The men of the mines remember now that they are men . " Jacob gazed , deeply agitated , then said in a false irrelevant voice : " Thank you , Father . Many times in visiting a buttee , crippled , yet doomed to live how many years no one knows on the taxpayers and the county , I have said to myself : How can I show him ? He 's taking it quiet with no fuss . It makes me ashamed of my easy life and my tempers : " " Yes , Jacob , that is true , but what troubles you now ? "  | The labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his cap . " Father , night and day I rejoice that Sewell 's child is dead . It gives me no rest . I am afraid now . I know what fear is for the first time . Catherine has fought for our Jeanie . I fear for her life with me rejoicing over Beatrice Sewell . " The priest looked closer , but he was so nearsighted that he seemed to peer uselessly . " Ah , you fear something will take Jeanie . Who made this child ? You and Catherine , you think ? " Jacob 's leonine head had sunk against his chest . " No , Father . " " Your best is no more than a stone , compared with the bread from God , without which all alike perish . She is His care . " The priest again stood silent for a moment . " I prescribe penance for you . Every time you think of this Beatrice , say , ' Ilow have I failed Catherine ? ' This is a hard penance . " " She is Presbyterian and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as she is because she is a woman , like any other , neither Presbyterian nor Scotch . Man is prone to err . " " Yes ? " Jacob was listening . " While your mother lived , you were  --  never quite weaned . Now you make Jeanie an idol . You wrong Jeanie greatly , but Catherine more . " " How can you love after you have fought about money ? Always , she was bitter when I put organization work ahead of her and the children , and made less money than the miners . " " You are divided against yourself . Part of you belongs to your Uncle Jo . Think of Catherine with the same breath you think of yourself . A double thought  --  an identical twin of a thought  --  is the team that pulls a marriage along the sheer cliffs where all must go . When you are with Catherine and Jeanie , it is Jeanie you can not peel your look from . You have cheated Catherine . You have not cherished her . " " Except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some woman passer-by , I have been faithful . "  | " Give Catherine her place . Then these fears will go from you . " Without looking up , Jacob whispered , " It is the truth . " Then as Father Finnigan took a step toward the street , " Nothing stays the same , " said Jacob . ' The priest answered , " Nothing that is real knows change  --  man , God , our return , His mercy . " For one second , Jacob 's face was broken . There was silence between them . Then , in his usual voice , Father Finnigan said , " The papers up and down the valley can no longer leave out your name , Jacob , as they did through the early years . It is wide proof of what I knew when I saw 3 ou as a child who would not be comforted , that dark day after the Culmtown fire . " " Thank you , Father . It was you , in those night lessons , who gave me my start . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a saint of another communion , who sent you to the city and had your hand mended and gave you a year in trade school . " Jacob looked reflectively into the distance . " That was a strange year , " he said . He grew suddenly reminiscent and his words came with an unaccustomed rush . " I used to walk the docks in Brooklyn . The water lapped against the piles . I 'd stand and watch until I 'd forget the time . I used to watch the grain running down the chutes from the elevators into the ships ? grain for bread for some far country I would never see . Then the chutes would be still , and there would be just the water lapping all night long every night . Then I 'd walk around and watch the girls creep out from the shadows and run away when they heard the step of a cop . I 'd listen to the sound of the tenements  --  men angry with women , children crying , singing , laughing . I 'd stand and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I for ? I 'm Jacob Czarkahow is that ? Then it was I understood that I had to know once and for all . I remembered all the whispers around the valley . And I remembered how everybody wondered when Mrs. Matthew Sewell sent me to New York . I had to know . Was there a Czarka or was it a name with no man for it ? Did my mother lie ? " " You never told me , " Father Finnigan said gently . " It was no sin , the way I did it . I never told my mother . Jacob Schlitz kept saying when it was and in Brooklyn . Well , I went  | hunting around , and there never was a Czarka married in Brooklyn in that year , in the precinct . " " To know who is your father is one of the deep needs of the heart . But , Jacob , your name Czarka is a special mercy for you here . If you had your own name , you would have been beaten before you started . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye and at his resolute jaw . " Maybe so , Father . When a man beats the mining laws right and left and kills good men by it  --  well , a son of his would be lucky if no one ever knew who his father was . " Father Finnigan gave him a searching look . " You are afraid ? " he asked . " That is why you will not leave the valley when they call upon you to work and hold office outside ? " " That is partly right . I stay where so many call out , Jacob , ' and nobody cares whether the rest of the name is Czarka or ? But I think I 'd stay right here , where I 've done many years ' organizing and married and all , if they were to ask me to be an officer of the United Mine Workers . " They turned toward the black height of the Dennison . " Jacob , " said the priest . Below ran the stream , peacock filmed and black by the water of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine . Each one is a great work of art , too , adapted to the structure of the earth that lies under . " Between the spot where they stood and the mine , the graves lay uneven . The immortelles , geraniums , even the mason jars , empty since " peeny day " were silhouetted in light against the colliery . Through the sound of intermittent traffic breathed the pumps and the whisper of the blackened stream over the stony shoals as it met the river . The crest of the colliery was lithographed against the tender evening . Behind the evergreen hedge rose the Pieta , face hidden by left arm . The sunset , from the point where they stood , now shone directly into the wide massed windows of the colliery , and made it look as though it were on fire . The windows , close together like the scales of a snake , were tiles of lucent gold . For a few moments , this holocaust light reflected obliquely on the two men as they stood . Above them the white marble angel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At midnight after the unveiling of the memorial , Archibald Sewell told the porters where to bestow his seductive pigskin luggage on an ocean liner at a Hoboken pier . He was tapped on the shoulder . A United States Marshal took him into custody . He protested . It was no use . He went with the officers of the law . The state authorities had become cynical about Arch  --  they had swallowed camels of civil injuries for some time . Arch had come to regard fines as a legitimate expense . All of a sudden , without so much as by your leave , the Federal Government itself investigated . It was that skunk , James Evans , who had started all this investigation nonsense , Arch was sure , with those damn affidavits he had filed with the Pennsylvania Bureau of Mines and the Bureau of Mines in Washington . Ever since then , he had felt nervous and hunted . Of course , a Bureau of Mines investigation into an explosion which had killed two men in the Culmtown had fizzled out satisfactorily . The Courier-Witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Humane Society for neglected animals , had given it a few lines in small print , which said : " MINE ACCUSED " The investigation into the mishap at the Culmtown Mine the first of the year , which brought out the fact that powder of a non-permissible kind had been used without the knowledge of mine superintendent Bevan , has been indefinitely postponed . " Arch smiled as he remembered it . Then he looked at the United States Marshal , and the smile faded from his face . Even a dizzy spell did not excuse his being so nervous that he wired a New York bank certain facts about his assets which were distinctly exaggerated . There in the telegraph company 's hands was proof of his intention to defraud a bank  --  it was all there in blue on yellow . Arch did not actually put on handcuffs , but he went quietly that night . He impressed even the detectives who apprehended him and they felt secretly a little complimented that he treated them so nearly as his own social equal . There was Arch for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a funeral wreath in  | his buttonhole at his last meal in the open as he sat on a high stool at a foul lunch counter that stank of stale food and sweat . At length Arch sat in a cell not more than ten feet square . The blank walls were like a moving-picture screen on which were projected many things he had to look at almost for the first time : the pustules of old rags stuffed in the broken windows in Culmtown , the six inches of dust on the road in summer , the sea of mud in the winter , the wind blowing through the chinks in the fluky houses , the wretched children down with dysentery . Queer how all the pink pearls of his living had dissolved as completely as though in Cleopatra 's own vinegar . The worm holes in his rare books were all blind alleys for his thoughts , here in a cell . He had collected lots of old junk ; now he wished he had the cash it had cost . Money could talk , even from a cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago by the Molly Maguires . The silence of the cell now was the silence of Jacob , his son . Then his mind filled with sound : " The blood came streaming down , and he never said a mumbling word , not a word . " That was the somber recurring chorus in this incredible eternity . But he was a real man , that son of his  --  shoulders  --  poise . As the first night in prison came on , his pain ebbed . He felt a bleak inexplicable comfort . At Twin Towers , his most burning need was , by hook or by crook , by sedative , mechanical exerciser , or massage , to trick the universe into giving a few hours ' sleep . There was a cockeyed , cold sense of security in a cell because no longer was it possible to get up and go anywhere , cutting seconds off his record by tallyho to Pittsville , or by motor car to New I-Iartford . He had a cot and a chair , but no rugs on the floor with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time since he was fifteen he had no place to go .. . no Schlitz 's , no cockfight , no Europe , no races , no society columns , no William Winlock 's bank for a loan . The place where the Mollys had slugged him came alive against the harsh cot  --  it expanded and throbbed . It felt hot as a coal of fire . Although sleep came sooner than it had in the years of so-called freedom , Arch did not lie still for more than a few seconds . Neither did he cease long from troubled mumbling . Most of what he said remained incoherent .  | In the morning , he wrote his niece , and felt better for an hour . He addressed the envelope with an inward swagger " The Honorable Mrs. David Rockford , " ahem ? " New Hartford , Pennsylvania . " He accentuated the slight tremor in his handwriting . He begged and implored her to come at once . At the big house by the river , Sally stood at the telephone . " Hello ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . " Why , hello , Marion , how nice to hear you . " " Well , I just wanted you to know that if I could do anything , just count on me . " Thought of her brother held two beats of Sally 's heart . In a hard voice she said , " What is it , Marion ? We have heard nothing . " " Did n't you see the paper this morning ? " " No . What is it ? If you can , tell me now . " " It 's Luke . I know , of course , you do n't really care . A lot of water has gone under the bridge since Shawnee . I do n't suppose you 've even heard from him since  --  since that Christmas . " " No , of course not , " she lied . " It 's good you got over it all before this happened , is n't it ? Convenient , I 'd say  --  even lucky . But , Sally , I 've wanted to say this to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl still , and you must keep hold and not lose all interest in how you look and what you put on . It 's so easy when nothing seems to go right to let down about the little things . I fcund the new hairdresser opposite Sax 's is wonderful . He fixes my hair just beautifully . Will you try him , for my sake ? " " For your sake , Marion . Good-by . " She hung up and moved , veering strangely , toward the paper which lay untouched by her father 's chair . She looked at the first page . There in capital letters across the top she read : " LOCAL HERO DEAD " On Friday , September 12 , 1918 , at the British hospital at Neuilly , Luke Dennison ... " The paper fell to the floor . She went upstairs . She slipped into bed , quiet and furtive as though she were cheating , and turned  | toward the wall . After a while Janet came up and spoke to her , but she did not answer . Janet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five minutes or an hour . Poised on the doorsill , Janet spoke . " He died a man . Take comfort , Lamb , and be brave . Get up now . Do n't you remember that your Uncle Arch has sent for you from prison ? " Sally moaned . Janet continued implacably . " I never thought to see your courage all gone like this . It 's stood so much and you never saying one complaint  --  no , not even when you were little and bound on the board six whole months in the hospital . Now here you are as though you 'd had a real sickness . I know you do n't care about your Uncle Arch , dearie dear  --  nor does the whole valley , and it 's good riddance to him , we say  --  but he 's asking for you from prison and you told me you were going . You must n't lie here like this , Lamb . " Sally protested weakly . " You see yourself that I ca n't stand up , so it 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when I am able , I will come . " Janet stood immovable . I-Ier clear , pale eyes and firm mouth were waiting . She knew from experience that when words failed , silence succeeded . " Well ? " asked Sally without looking at her . " Must you say when ' and not if ' ? All right , have it your own way , but for God 's sake , go away . " " Yes , " said Janet reflectively , " I could do that and still be true to you . If you go when you can , no one could do more . But if you do n't do what you think you ought to do , then you get off the right path and the next step is not clear to you . Is n't that so ? I know you like a book . " A sound like the whine of a lonely spaniel yearning for human powers of expression was Sally 's only response . Janet tiptoed out . She lay quiet , grateful to be alone . Memories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backdropped by her eyelids . Rockford Ashe  --  the blue of the larkspur in the first pale shafts of morning sun , the shoal of crimson silk of the  | valance , the wine-like chintz , the look of morning tea on the day of separation .. . She had denied herself brutally in telling herself even when alone not to look at the fragrant little garments , folded and waiting , and at David 's own clothes , hanging obedient , collapsed , also waiting . No jealous destiny could say she had taken anything for granted and had to be taught , so as never to expect anything . How could a woman so out of key with her world go on , if she believed the poorest child in any climate anywhere was of more value than the entire world without that child ? David was dead . Her child was dead . Now Luke was dead . And they all asked her now to visit a prison where the collective will had placed warped and wretched brothers  --  degenerate , miserable , despairing or clammy with self-deception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her tears , held back so long they had almost dried up , would gush and break the thin membrane over her wounds , and all to do over again . David was the first , of course , but Luke meant more than she had imagined . " Luke  --  Luke  --  I do not weep , but I can not stand on my feet . Do you hear ? Are you returned to our valley , a separate shadow rising in perpetual motion , like our own river fogs , like our white smoke ? " The following day , looking indeed as though she were recovering from grave illness , she walked through the blowing steam at the station and took the train which would carry her to the prison . Opposite her sat a Slovak woman from one of the mine towns , cherishing a new-born child . The baby 's weak , intermittent wail dried Sally 's throat and blocked her breath . Then the voice died , became mere stertorous gutterings , each time weaker . Sally rose and bent over the strange woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying . She called the conductor and the brakeman . They went off in opposite directions . In three minutes the brakeman returned with a doctor  --  a small , sharp man with doublelensed glasses . He whipped his stethoscope out of his bag and adjusted it against the child 's chest . He listened , then with incredible swiftness administered a hypodermic . Slowly , slowly , the baby 's color changed . The blue receded into mottled areas .  | The child took one weak and infinitesimal breath . To Sally 's amazement there followed another and still another , each deeper than the last . The doctor wiped sweat from his forehead . He looked up and snapped on a nervous smile . " Just in time , " he said . " Blue baby ? " Sally whispered . He shook his head . " No , no . Just acute colic . " He turned to the child 's mother . " What did he eat ? " " Canned corn . Him like . " " Did you open the can today ? " asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When ? " " Don ' know . Maybe Maunday , maybe Saunday . " The doctor made gestures to show that he was opening a can and dumping its contents into a dish . " Food no good after top off . See ? " " If there was any way to heat water , " he said to Sally . She answered quickly . " I brought my lunchbox with me . It has an alcohol lamp that I use for tea . " She heated water . As she moved , strength came flowing back into her . She tested the water on her wrist . Her hands felt as flexible and skilled as the doctor 's own as she filled the syringe . He said , " I can see you 've had training . " She did not answer . She held the baby for the rest of the journey . At first she watched every breath . The doctor sat down opposite her . She looked up from the child for a moment to see him reading a detective story . A sudden laugh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the wheels turned , something began happening to her which she could not understand , nor could she have understood it if she had seen it described in a book . It was as though throughout all the years of her life her body had been fastened together at the joints with thick bands of spastic muscle in which there was no give . Now , seeping curiously from the seven pounds in her arms , there came into her tight body a something , still and sure like water or sleep . It flowed into her veins and arteries , into all her nerves that traveled from brain to surface and from surface back to brain . It inundated all her thoughts so that they did not beat and jangle and nudge and  | shove in too narrow a space . They succumbed quietly and were drowned , no longer arranging themselves in incessant and inevitable sequences of sentences , questions , paragraphs , letters , obituaries , protests . Subdued , she sat listening to the child 's breathing . " Forest Hill , " called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her arms . She might have known that it could not last and that tomorrow and tomorrow would begin filing past again . The train came almost to a stop with a ruthless grinding of brakes . Sally took her tea basket and went down the aisle . At the door she turned and looked back . She saw merely a mother and a child . She climbed down off the train and signaled to a cabman . She got into the cab and said sternly , " The prison . " Well , nothing remained the same . This was as true of rebellion as it was of redemption . From day to day , each moment had to be new or else life would grow as poisonous as corn left standing in an opened tin can . She walked up the adamantine ascent to the grim portal of the prison . The guard unlocked the door of the visitors ' room . Sally went in and took her uncle 's hand . He kissed her with great ostentation . Then she sat down in the chair brought by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there was no necessity . Her uncle got his words in first . " Well , well , if we do n't see the Honorable Mrs. Rockford before our eyes . Sal , I never saw you lookin ' better in your life . Damned handsome , once you forget the prunes and prisms that I always feared were part of your makeup . " She opened her mouth once again , but he rushed on . " Well , this is a bitter joke on me , I 'll admit . When the public gets riled up and ca n't say just what 's the matter with the cost of living or the cost of coal , the politicians get busy and investigatin ' committees have to earn their salt and drag somebody out and throw them to the lions as they did in Rome , or to the gutter rats that make a tin-can living out of the local papers . The one thing I regret is my father is n't alive to be humiliated by all this hue and cry . He was too hard on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't you let people tell you it 's the first wrong step . There was n't a snip of harm in my being so considerate of my dear mother . You know I used to wait till they were both asleep and then whish , I 'd slide down the rain gutter . Do you know , she had a stronger one made of copper put up ? I always wondered if it was n't for my convenience . " Say , I suppose you saw the fellow that ran away with Beatrice and gave you the mit , got his in France ? Teehee , guess I made a break though , did n't I ? But Beatrice had a way with men , Sally , she could n't help it . I used to watch it workin ' on two continents , and on boats , God help us . " Sally interrupted . " What can I do for you , Uncle Arch ? What was this mysterious errand ? " She spoke softly . Iler uncle 's physical degeneration was shocking to her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' powders just light me up like an arc light , " he said petulantly . " Do n't do a bit of good . " " What do you think would help ? " " I think a man that 's never been a real drinker but used to a little every day as I 've been . . . it 's as good as murder to deprive him of it . " " But , Uncle Arch , I think that 's impossible unless it 's the prescription of the doctor . " " Truth is , having such nightmares when I do sleep , I 'm afraid to sleep . That 's the bottom of the business . You have no idea the nervous strain involved in being in a place no wider than a cell . It gets to be a strain when you 've gone and come pretty much as you pleased as I have all my life . " You would n't remember , I suppose , but your Aunt Sue died suddenly . It was a terrible epidemic through the whole valley ? lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother was that it was on Sue 's wedding morning . Well , in those days I was quite a boy . " Here he gave his waggish race-track wink which looked singularly ghastly , set as it was in his shrunken and blotched face . " She was your grandmother 's favorite daughter , guess that was pretty well known . Your grandmother came mighty near going  | to pieces . One day right before she went abroad , she came into a saloon called Schlitz 's . It belonged to Jacob Schlitz , a fellow your grandmother saved in the end . . . . " " The one who dug graves ? " " I guess so . . . . You know , there were n't any good clubs in the valley at that time . It would be hard for you to understand why fellows like myself went to a place like that , where there was pretty mixed company , I 'll tell you . But women never , never went inside of a saloon . I can tell you . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , sitting and standing , froze up . Did n't raise a mug , did n't say a word , did n't move ... . She unwrapped her parcel and put two slippers down on Schlitz 's counter . . . . Dainty enough to drink out of , they were . I think she must have heard of drinking a girl 's health out of her slipper . She just said , Sue 's shoes . . . . ' Then she gave a sigh , and seemed to forget where she was ... . " The doctor , you see , had been at Schlitz 's the night before , they say , and had taken a bit too much , and there was an idea he might have taken better care of my beloved sister , if he had n't been at Schlitz 's . They all looked at me , but I knew it would give her a shock to see me there . I guess she knew I went at night sometimes " ? here he gave another grimace from his lewd old eyes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , and Jacob Schlitz took her arm and helped her down the steps , and into her carriage . Mark Stone could not have done it any better , could n't have done it better myself . Well , Schlitz tried to laugh it off and hung the slippers up over the bar . . . as though it had been a party , and so everybody 'd forget ' em and stop talkin ' about it . Well , that was that , but a friend of your grandmother named Stone  --  but I forgot she was your grandmother too ! ? changed the house around when my mother was in Europe and my mother asked her to give away my sister 's baby clothes left in the storeroom , where your grandma sometimes daubed pictures . Mrs. Stone gave the things to some baby some place . . . near Coldspring . " " Schlitz had Grandma Sewell help a boy with a crushed hand . I know him . He 's a great man now . " " No , no , no . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Formerly he had dissembled much better . Sally realized that he lied , but she was not altogether sure why . " It was that boy 's grandfather who shot the doctor , " she said , without haste , but clearly , " Dr. Vogel . I know about my beautiful Aunt Sue ? " " So he did . Well , why do we hash this all over ? I 'm trying to tell you , Sally , that it 's your grandmother that day coming into Schlitz 's . I keep seeing her in my sleep . I do n't sleep . I have to have something to drink or I wo n't take responsibility for what happens . " " Well , you never have , " came into her mouth , but she kept quiet . " Sally , Lazarus gave a drink to someone in Hell . You can slip me just a little Scotch next time you come . They 'd let you right through , you know . They 'd never search you . I hope you find time to come soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " They 'd smell it , Uncle Arch . It would only make everything harder for you . I 'll talk to the doctor and tell him .... " " Sally , a man who has survived the shocks and blows that I have had . . . all that business about my sister 's wedding , my .. . my . . . only child , our others born dead . . . your Aunt Rosie 's health for many , many years that always kept me worried , all the stress and strain of coal operations in this period , and keepin ' my estate together . . . . Well , you 're a woman , so you would n't understand . ... " Timidly , as though each word was extracted with tweezers , Sally began to talk about the four-foot beer mug that used to be in the front window of Schlitz 's when she was a child . She told her uncle the saloon had been bought out by the new management and given a fresh coat of paint over the millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and indifferent illnesses and mishaps among the neutrals of their acquaintance . She talked about the race horses that were corralling the most press notices . Sally had read the sports page at breakfast that morning for the first time in her life . Once or twice it seemed to her that the broken and deflated wreck before her was groping amid the ashes of former prides to find some phrase he had never used . . . but he did not find it .  | On her return home she found a letter , the last that there would be , from Luke . " September 17 , 1918 ... . " Beloved " ? in all the letters he never once alluded to her marriage or his own ? " everything indicates we are in for a big do . I think we will leave the trenches at dawn or before . " Please read the Catha Upanishad .

The fever that has been my life has waned and I am no longer afraid . That whiskered jealous God who haunted our childhood in our valley , is an illusion . Here is only something ambient , eternal , like air , present through day and night , through oaths and laughter , in whom we live and move and die and are dust , and have still our being . The years apart from you are folded and gone . I knew love once with you . You felt what it has taken a world war to teach me . You have practiced being in Heaven since you were little . Montaigne says the powerful imagination ends by creating what it imagines . Life even here in the mud is good every day , now , every minute of the day . I see that , too . My life , so much of it wasted , is ending . With me I take my love for you . LUKE " With trepidation Sally approached the manager of the general store at Springville on Hazleton Mountain . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron note sounding in the general insecurity of her attitude , " with some leaflets , hoping you would allow them to be picked up by any who comes in . " " No distribution of handbills in this town , madam . Sorry . " " But they are baby welfare pamphlets . They explain how little babies can live and thrive here , where everything is so different from the old country where they came from . " The man chewed his lip and examined Sally from head to foot with an insolent stare . " How do I know what you say is so ? I ca n't read these languages . No , ma'am . Sorry . Ordinance makes it a jail offense  | to distribute handbills even when they are in English and can be examined . " She passed him the one in English . He read aloud , " Throw away tin cans as soon as you open them . " He threw back his head and laughed . " Hell , " he said . " They do . Look around . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her shoulders bowed under defeat as though she were a drummer who would be turned off by night if she failed to bring in an order from Hazleton Mountain . At the door she said , " Thank you . I 'm glad I gave you a laugh . " Outside in the muddy road she met Jacob Czarka . They shook hands , then stood in silence . Jacob spoke first . " All in Coldspring , all who knew you , Mrs. Rockford , were sorry for what had to happen . The women said it was too bad about the baby , but war 's bound to take the men . " " Thank you , Jacob , thank you a lot . " " And what can you be doing ' way up here ? " " I have had these pamphlets prepared by the visiting nurses and a doctor . They speak of the commonest mistakes that cause our death rate to be so very high in this region . On the front here , is the address of every baby-welfare station in the valley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had sorted from the sample sheaf . " This is good work , " he said . " Jacob , you are a great man in the valley now . All the men in the mines hereabouts acknowledge you as their leader , and I have heard that they want you to go elsewhere to lead still more men . But once long ago Jeanie MacGregor  --  my Jeanie  --  told me you were a great man . Nowadays the newspapers only say about you what the rest of us have known all along . " " Thank you for saying so , Mrs. Rockford . I remember you too  --  I remember you well . You were a nice little girl who could be kind if she had half a chance . Besides , a MacGregor raised you and the MacGregors are powerful people . " " How is Catherine , Jacob ? I still like to remember that I was at your wedding . Janet says you have a little girl named  --  Jeanie . I 'm glad you named her that . How is she ? "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was a terrible thin baby , looked like a bird without feathers . Tell you what I 'll do if you want . " " What ? " " I 'll see these pamphlets are addressed from the birth record for the past year , and then I 'll have a pamphlet in the language of the parents delivered . It 's easy enough for me , and the union is interested in work like this . How many did you have printed ? " " I had to guess , so I do n't know whether the number is correct . There are eight hundred in English , six hundred in Hungarian , four hundred in Slovak . I forget how many in Polish , Italian , Lithuanian , Russian  --  but I have it all written down . Do you really feel this is possible , Jacob ? " " It ca n't be avoided , " he said , with a flash of Sewell irony . " This is a fine piece of work , Mrs. Rockford . Janet know about this ? " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know how to raise a baby was pretty terrible nonsense , would n't she ? " " Yes , " said Jacob with a slow smile . " Catherine , my wife , would say , Read a book to tell you how to raise your own children ? Are you losing your mind ? ' So we wo n't tell them ... . " No , we wo n't tell them . " They laughed . Jacob left her . Sally stood looking after him , relieved as a lost child who has just learned the way home . Jacob had changed a great deal since she had last seen him . He looked much older . That every family with a baby should have a pamphlet in one of eight languages seemed simple to him . He was a great man . " Where shall I bring the pamphlets ? " she called . " To the Central Labor Committee 's Union Hall in New I-Iartford , " he said without shouting . His voice carried a long way . He looked at his watch and strode on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cease their talk . Well , she should be very proud that he had had time to stop for any talk at all  --  and more than grateful for his potent arm now definitely beneath her futile , silly effort . She gazed across the valley . From the height where she stood , the rhythmic roll of the two parallel ranges on the other side was blue and restful as the sea .  | Chapter VIII : Sally Goes On 1918 AT the Settlers ' Annual Celebration , William Winlock with his daughter 's slim ungloved hand on his arm , came through the wrought gates and took a seat in the back row of the semicircle of chairs arranged about the monument . The monument itself was heaped with garden flowers , some still glistening . William and Sally , as they looked that day , lingered long in the minds of those who saw them . Sally wore floating white drapery . Her eyes were grave and her smile was impersonal almost as sun or rain , until she spoke and then her face would come alive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word about Mark . He had been decorated in a hollow square of troops at the same time as the general of the division . he was in a hospital " resting , " not wounded , just sick . In time they would know the facts . It might be much better than they dared hope . He still lived . This alone made the day memorable . In the blue vista of the valley , veiled by the blowing smoke , the crest of the Coldspring was just visible . William and Sally both looked . Beneath their own pulse was the strong throb of that pump that still beat in spite of death , disaster , war . William thought of an hour 's rebellion when he had accepted the bitter bread of a mine instead of a ship . Once he had decided that he would never go down the Coldspring . From 1874 until 1902 he had accepted the fact that he never would go below without that brute panic and conviction that the walls would cave in upon him as they had upon his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mines in the valley . At his mother 's death , this fear had left him . He had not told anyone , lest he would feel that fear again . He looked at his daughter . There were some things about her like his mother . In Sally 's mind six lines kept repeating themselves : " No more dams I 'll make for fish ; Nor fetch in firing At requiring , Nor scrape trencher , nor wash dish ; ' Ban ? ' Ban , Ca  --  Caliban , Has a new master  --  Get a new man . " " Has a new master  --  Get a new man , " for if Mark were really through in France , what of the Coldspring ? She took firm hold of her left hand with her right . Women could run mines or ruin them . Women had . Sara Winlock Stone had held the mine through days more troubled . Yes , but what for ? Who could n't ? for a son ? Neither father nor daughter , sitting so still , could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the occasion . The Settlers ' descendents were always humble about their own histrionic powers when it came to the celebration of the massacre of 1778 . No one in the valley could be really " good enough " to be the orator on that day . No , sirree . After the ceremony , came the fluttering , moving , handclasps , and the luncheon at the Swetland Homestead , with champagne ? and remembrance of the past . Together the Settlers ' descendants had been bred from struggle , along the polished metal of their river circled by forest and sky , along the gentian Appalachians . Among those hills now tumultuous plumes of white smoke rose , folded ; dipped in light from mines and mills  --  pillars of cloud by day , by night fiery writing from the burning culm which could not be put out . The Settlers ' straight New England eyes watched along with eyes from a dozen countries , eyes of men who strained in the deep places of the earth . Next morning as usual , William went over to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him at noon as he made  | a speech in the Liberty Bond Drive . He stood on the office steps with the men standing within three feet of him . In the afternoon he sat under one of the copper beeches with Mark 's two little girls playing near him . The telephone tinkled . Sally came out of the house asking if she could take a message from the bank . He said , " No , " and went in . When he came back he said , " Sally , they got that fellow who forged the big check . I 'm very glad . It 's a load off my mind . " At tea time she brought out a little tray and put a cup in his hand . Sometimes he drank it , sometimes not . Tea seemed like such a wicked waste of time to William . He remained the same about everything . Pshaw , he would never go for a plain unadulterated drive with his only daughter , Sara Rockford . She had to lie every afternoon and make up unlikely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain just as though she were still eighteen , without rights , or good judgment . A train of heavy coal cars pointed toward tidewater along the new trestled bridge by the river island . Small Mollie Winlock was instructing her still smaller sister , Sally : " Now you pretend your child is trying to run away from you . He does n't like to stay home any more . " " Dollie , stay home , " instructed the other shaking her baby hand at her doll . William scribbled with his pencil on the margin of the newspaper . The late afternoon light rested upon the mellow stone of the house his Uncle John had built , amid the sumptuous foliage . That night Sally wakened suddenly . She went in to her father and found him unconscious . The doctor came . The pump that had first leaked at the strike of 1902 under the strain of a mob and his mother 's death , had missed now and then ever since . It was flooded and jammed now . IIe never regained consciousness . His daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hospital overseas was the final blow . He had always been able to carry the Coldspring even in bad times without the weight being too heavy . Next day she scrutinized the numbers and the random writing he had scribbled on the margin of the newspaper , in his live hand only the day before . There was a big number . She had heard  | him repeat it on the telephone . It was the amount of the forged check at the bank . He had written his own name and then drawn some remarkably accurate geometric figures on the newspaper . The Connecticut Settlers , in their moments of pause between fighting , planting , loving , dying , always thought . They pondered the relationship between man , the visible universe , and eternity . It was natural that a Winlock , at leisure and past middle-life , when scribbling symbols of his intuitions of which he himself was unaware , should have drawn geometric patterns , balanced , disciplined , complete , the configurations of a finished and ideal world of mathematician or apostle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had written a single word , " Happy , " with a capital " H " and underlined it with his hard firm stroke . " William Winlock died last night " was whispered along the sixteen miles underground of the Coldspring Mine . When the men came up at five , they found at the top of the shaft a large notice : " DUE TO THE SUDDEN DEATH OF MR . WILLIAM WINLOCK LAST NIGHT THE COLDSPRING MINE WILL BE CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE . " Then in smaller type was added , " The successful operation of a mine by a single family of owners for so many years calls for more complex qualities than a company-owned mine . At all times he has had our bottomless respect . " BRET BUDGE , Assistant Superintendent " Outside the barricade stood a wide group of anxious wives almost as though there had been an explosion . Children too small to stand alone were clinging to their mothers ' aproned knees . All their faces asked , " What will happen now ? " Each woman attached herself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men began telling what would happen . At the foot of the cobbled incline into Coldspring , their explanations were over . There was grim silence along the slow processional moving to the clump of heavy boots . Doors slammed . Soon the two cross lanes and the two streets  | parallel with the ridge of the mountains were as silent as a ghostcamp shut down twenty years . It even seemed suddenly to become ten degrees colder . Clouds obliterated the setting sun . There was no heat anywhere except in the vibrating air above the narrow little chimneys . There was no sound but the Coldspring pumps . They could not cease even for the owner 's wake , nor a wedding shebeen . After the puff , came the regular convulsion of splashing water over the cobbled drain . The men gathered as usual at the store . Tomato-Face was gnawing the stem of his stinking old pipe . Twelve men had offered him a light . This was no time to smoke . The others lighted up , all along the fence , like a chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Upon them did not rest the ritual of a night so momentous in Coldspring . There was a low murmur of talk . Boots shifted and clicked . When a man thought of something to say , he said the same thing several times over . Even saying the most appalling things was better somehow than thinking them all alone . One man said , " She 'll stay closed till after the war because the estate has to be settled . All the heirs have to sit down and hear the will read . " " If Captain Winlock comes back alive , perhaps it could open then . He might send a cable under the sea and say , Go on Coldspring . ' He might even cable Bret Budge . How can we know , perhaps a cable is on the way , but they say that Captain Winlock is not getting well . Maybe he 'll come home in a white pine overcoach . ' " An old Scotchman intoned , " Mortmain will make it idle . " Who was mortmain ? Others said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about the Coldspring , the tonnage , the strikes , the rock falls , and such an account took years , and then no one read it for other years , and then someone decided what to do after that . Others said the Turkey Coal Company would buy it , still others that the owner of Culmtown would buy it and scrap it , always having been so jealous of the tonnage . Wall Street bankers wanted it , too , just to flood , so their coal in West Virginia would bring a higher price , or they might add it to their pool and let it work two days in ten , so as  | to keep the price up and the output down . All of a sudden they understood how alone and vulnerable prestige makes a mine . It was safer if a hostile world never heard of you or forgot whatever it had heard . Tomato-Face looked at the pattern of their white faces above the beaded thread of lights made by their pipes . No message seemed to come to him . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the women were most frightened , they groped about without lighting their one kerosene lamp , feeling a grim something unlike comfort about saving a tenth of a cent of oil , if the mine was closing down . The children , wise beyond their years , made no trouble or commotion . Here and there along the streets came a weak helpless cry from some child too small to understand it ought not to cry this night . The bass fumble of the boots at the store continued . On the outskirts of the crowd two of the mule-drivers and two laborers started down the tracks from the mine toward the railroad yards . They would be riding the rods by dawn . Beyond the Ashley Planes , as the coal cars shunted and shifted with them , they would begin their journey through the nation . Tomato-Face sensed the withdrawal of these four . He cleared his throat . He could not wait longer for direct inspiration . Things were slipping . He held onto the upright with his left hand . " Life 's one damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if you and yours are cold , remember , it 's the winter gives us our market . Mow could we have lived so long as we have ? If you and yours go hungry , think if the domestic market was cut off , how 'd we ever get this far ? There 's many a woman 's figger in Coldspring will be the better if we all go onto dandelions for a while . It 's still summer . Thank God for that . Thank your Maker who has been mindful of his children here for calling home his son this day and not  --  say , Christmas week . " Now the dead ai n't no better than the living . He made mistakes like you and me , some we ca n't forget , some due to conditions which could not have been made smooth by Gabriel himself .

It 's plain as my nose . Now pull in your belts , stick around . At most this wait ca n't be more'n a few weeks . They ca n't afford to close down the Coldspring . The world ca n't . The government ca n't . That wisp of a woman of the Winlocks ca n't do it . Ca n't afford to . I heard , though I can not disclose how , the local will supply paint on credit , at cost , and you will be painting the company houses and the cost of said paint to be adjudicated with the Winlock estate . If we fall into ownership of an absentee not present , would n't his investigator and superintendent report on the property better , if it looked better ? Mend the fences . Weed the land , so 's we 'll be bright as ten-cent tinware . " Whatsa ' matter ? Do n't you know you got the greatest labor organization in the world at your back ? Quit the spittin ' , let 's sing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get habits like folks . Winlock did n't walk out on us or sell us down the river to Wall Street without our knowing . He only died , did n't he ? That 's a simple thing we all can do , too . " " Should auld acquaintance be forgot " was started by a knot of the Scotch and taken up by the others . Then they sang " Good Union Citizan . " The day after William Winlock died , Jacob Czarka sat in the drawing room of the Winlock house . His chair was carved of French walnut and upholstered in beige satin . He was looking at the painting of a little girl with red hair , a jumping rope in her hand , her tawny mane still flying out behind from haste and wind . It was undoubtedly Sally Winlock , though somewhat prettied up . Mrs. Rockford came in and shook hands . " Join ' me in coffee , Jacob , " she said as a tray was brought . She poured him a cup without ceremony , almost as though she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come . . . very . . . . You are such a big man now . . . so very important to the valley . " " I had a great respect for your father , " he said . " Life is too short to have it one long civil war , is n't it ? " " We got our pamphlets out , nice and quiet , did n't we ? " p 416 " Yes , just that ! " He hesitated , then spoke firmly . " Mrs. Rockford , this seems wrong to bother you tonight , but I come for the people of Coldspring that asked me . Through no fault of their own , the whole winter they may freeze and starve if banks and executors and the legal rigamarole which holds us from flying into pieces around the horizon , do n't realize that people that die , children that starve , ca n't be brought back after the papers are all signed , sealed and registered . With your brother away and your father gone  --  may he rest in peace  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Being a Winlock , you hold the only key to open , to reopen , I may say , the Coldspring Mine . Here we are in a rush of orders . There 's no trouble with the demand side of the problem , and plenty of coal still left , and we got in the Coldspring equipment as fine as any in Pennsylvania . You know the picture as well as I do . Are a lot of lawyers and bankers , dead as last year 's locusts , goin ' to hold us up now ? Not if I know you . Now you got your chance . Janet 's told me about you . Maybe you had to change and get hard over there in England to go on . You had your own troubles , I know that . You and I see eye to eye , Mrs. Rockford , or Miss Sally , if I can still call you that . We know you by that name . " " Jacob , thank you for remembering me when everything seems so uncertain . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You lost part of your hand in a mine . But when I first saw you , I felt better . I knew life would not get you down .. . and I knew there was n't enough money in the world to buy you . You have given me hope about the anthracite fields , when everything else was . . . confused . " " Our side has made mistakes , too . Simple things like dying we can all do right along , in the mines and above ground . It 's these big economic forces like supply and demand and Wall Street that get us down . " Well , you 're tired , I guess . But this night and what you do about the Winlock Mine tomorrow are pretty important to many hundreds of not just men and boys , but women like yourself with little ones . Some of ' ern are crying ; they ca n't explain yet just why . "  | The day after William Winlock 's funeral , Sally went to Coldspring and tapped at the door of the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . He was the son of George Budge , trusted in her grandfather 's time . " IIow do you do , Miss Win . . . Mrs. Rockford . " " How do you do , Mr. Budge ? " " Right kind of you to come . " " I 'm one of the executors . " " Do n't say . Supposed it was your brother . " " The date on the will shows that my father , thoughtful in all things , foresaw the possibility that my brother might still be away or not available to serve at the time of his own possible death . " " Must have trusted you , Miss . . . Mrs. Rockford . " " The bank is the other executor . We agree that there should be no interruption in getting out the tonnage , the country being at war , as it is . It is our service now . " " Must say I was s'prised to see you so early this morning . But this 'll put life back into Coldspring , I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of us . " I do n't suppose you count on making a change at the head of the setup , " he went on , " because  --  well , I been here since I was nine , and my father started in as a coal-picker and worked right up , so I got experience . The coal business is intri-cate to say the least , and if a shyster wheeled you into putting him into some responsibility over here in some new-fangled setup , the risks to the men underground and to the returns would be a terrible thing , Miss . . . Mrs. Rockford . I always want to say Winlock , having a very kind memory of your grandmother  --  and my family knowing her well . " " She ran the Coldspring until her son was able to come home and take it on , you remember , " said Sally . " Ah , but times are not the same . She was an extraordinary woman , and the times were not so hard .

Now the setup is so complicated , a manage-  | ment do n't get two chances to make one mistake , not in mining . . . no . . . it takes a man . Experienced here . " Here he shook his hewn and bony countenance at Sally . His skin was weathered and freckled . He had been at work above ground since his left leg had been crushed . He had thrown himself with a sprag , before a line of runaway coal cars rushing to the foot of the sump . . . where waited enough dynamite to wreck the shaft if the cars had hit it , just like Dougall long before . Sally answered , " Father said , Bret Budge has the best judgment , bar none , that I have met , in running a mine . He has been assistant superintendent for a long time . ' " Bret 's face lighted for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I plan to take over . You will be my superintendent , as you were for my father .

" A vindictive gleam sparked his blue eyes for a moment . " And you sign ' ern , " he said . " Thanks for the . . . " He did not finish ... . Before she had come , with the entire Coldspring Mine in the balance he had thought only of its going on , and not of himself . He had thought of Coldspring Village , and the winter to come . Then , it was the mine that mattered . Now , relieved of that fear , he resented this palpably unjust situation . That the owners of money could buy his brains , his innermost integrity , based on a lifetime 's study and effort in the mines seemed too much . He gave a sigh that merged into a clearing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " believes that the name Winlockit will be on the mine stationery  --  will be an asset . I know only too well that I am very ignorant , and that you are wise and now indispensable , as never before . With this added burden , your salary will be increased by one hundred dollars a month . It is the bank which specified this amount . I felt it should be double , but I am ignorant about finance , too . Bret .. . if , if you will let me call you that .... " He looked at her . His eyes told her he would resign in the next sentence if only there were another job in Pennsylvania or the world-at-large for a man his age , with one leg . He swallowed .  | She continued hastily , " No , not Bret , Mr. Budge , and perhaps you would call me just Miss Sally , as people used to , when I came here with my father . " Overtaken by a sudden faintness , she sat quietly . Bret Budge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassment . Finally she spoke again . " Mr. Budge , I had not planned to stay even so long as this today . Could you , do you think , let me take hold of your arm , as far as the car ? As you remember , Father never let the chauffeur come so far as the stockade . I regret that I had to , today . " Bret Budge arose , nimble in one surge of strength , and planted his crutch with complacence and determination . She was a weak woman , who would fall without his arm . " Of course , " he said , " of course . " Sally grasped his sinewed arm . She needed him . He could tell by her clutch . Together they walked back through the clearing . IIe helped her into the car with the chauffeur standing there with nothing to do ... . Who did he think that he was ? A man ? He went back to the office and shut the door . He sat gazing at his blotter . He had really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some would say five , years . Mr. Winlock 's other business had crowded in and in . When his daughter had married and left him , his mainspring had suddenly lost its snap . And now , everything was to do over again . He would always have to submit everything that was already right , actually perfect , and discuss it with whom ? A Winlock woman , beautiful and high-class and everything that instinct , verified by his lifetime in the anthracite fields , had taught him to dislike and distrust . Besides , she had no , absolutely no , sense of humor . Low jokes , of course , were out , but there would not be any jokes of any kind with her around . Holy mackerel ! Why did this setup have to happen to him ! At last he arose , spat out his quid of tobacco , sniffed and called the mine clerk in the next room . The bookkeeper came in . " I 'm actually in charge , " he said , " though it is advisable to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stationery . Take this : " This mine will reopen on Friday , tomorrow , and run six days a week until further notice : "  | The clerk waited for further dictation . Here Bret paused . The pause weighed too long . " Yes ? " said the clerk . " Sign it , S. Winlock . Bret Budge , Assistant Superintendent . ' Then blow the siren . " The good news had leaked out in some way . The car carrying Sally away slowed down where the road from Coldspring Village joined the turnpike . There was a sound of running feet . In the gutter stood a group of children , too small to be in school . They were waving at her . The whistle began blowing over their heads . The children sang : " Happy birthday to you , happy birthday to you . " She made the car stop till they finished . She smiled as though it really were her birthday . At lunch Sally found that the beef broth tasted good . She ate salad , too . Whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely left behind her that self which had been in England , she could not say . But anyway she felt different . In England she had been no more than a child , all her senses kicking and screaming and on strike for clays . She had been pregnant too , of course , and perhaps that had made the big difference . Flow grateful she should be that the Coldspring needed her now . It could not have gone on unless she had come home . What if she had wandered around the globe with restless feet after distractions which could not satisfy narrow , high-strung Winlocks , who needed hard things to make them happy . This new burden would only last for the few weeks or , at most , months till dear Mark came home to claim his own again . He would come . All of them should see . Mark would come home because there was a pattern and sense to things . One family , one person left at home , could not lose everybody , even in a war . When Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took her pulse . He said , " The trip to Coldspring did not hurt you . Guess you knew what you could do . I heard the women cried . Now there 's a shebeen on that wo n't be over till morning . " " Father would be glad of the shebeen , " she said . " The people who ca n't let themselves go overestimate the privilege , my dear , " was his answer .  | The brass plates which said " George F. Freeman , M.D. " and below " Thomas Freeman , M.D. " were as bright as labor and polish could make them , but the clapboards beneath were cracked with age and , with their white paint long gone , had turned to gray . The waiting room inside had faded blue walls . The chairs Myra Freeman liked least in her house had , one by one , been given place in a motley row around the room . The curious blend of drugs , tobacco , : swept wool , and sun on plants and patients , gave the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generations in New Hartford , had an effect powerful as a mystic charm against the worst . In the Freemans ' office nothing seemed so bad as it had outside . At the square oak desk sat Miss Susie Graham . She was an elderly woman who had been born in Coldspring . Now her blue eyes were watery , and her neatly parted hair was white . She had kept the Freeman books for as long as anyone could remember . Two patients were waiting . At a sign from Susie , the girl with the head cold went in . The only one still waiting now was Mark Winlock . Mark looked like a terrible caricature of his former lithe and brilliant self . He seemed to have suffered burial and been exhumed , so strange and translucent did his flesh appear , above his uniform . A bright streak of ribbons showed above his left pocket . " Nice to see you safe home again , Mr. Mark , " Susie said . " You brought my nephew Colin home safe to Coldspring , too . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Susie . He rose and went inside . Within , he sat down in the old mission rocker by the window . " You 're looking better , " said the doctor , warming the stethoscope between his hands . Mark unbuttoned his coat , the stethoscope went up under his shirt . The doctor listened long and slowly to his chest , and then to his back , and then to both of them all over again . At length he sat down himself . " Not so bad , Mark , as I feared from the report that came . " " You do n't need to spare me , or dissemble except in front of the family , " said Mark . " It 's easier if they do n't know , that 's all . " " Not so fast , Mark . You must go west . This tuberculosis can be checked  --  "  | " If it were n't for my heart , " put in Mark , " that ca n't stand the altitude my lungs need . They explained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You do n't say ! Well , they do n't know the meteorology that doctors in the coal fields just naturally develop in their study of lungs in mines . I 'll start you at two thousand feet , and then gradually increase the altitude . " " Dr. Freeman , the war 's been enough . Please , please , what do you think I am ? I drove over bodies in the Argonne as though they were no more than trash fallen off on the way to the dump . What I have is fatal . The encyclopedia says so . " " You do n't say . If you knew the advantage it was to have heart trouble , you would n't look so sour . You will have to take care of your heart  --  no indulgences , no loss of self-control in big Winlock scenes . With care , Mark , and in the West , I predict you will live to bury us all . It 's not you , it 's your sister who keeps me thinking nights . I suppose you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salvation really since your father died . With this duty and interest , she is healthier and in a better state of mind than I have ever seen her . You hardly knew her , did you ? She even tries to tell a feeble joke now and again , and at least pays enough attention to what is being said by others to smile at the right time and murmur , How wonderful , ' when it is n't , but it shows she has been attending with at least one ear . " Now if you could swap the mine for the securities your father left her . . . . How would that be , if you considered it more for her good than your own ? " " She might ruin it , and lose it . A mine is always a gambler 's chance . " " Well , she 's made a good thing of it so far . The real mining judgment is Bret 's , of course , but she has brought in a respectable set of new orders , I hear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her methods . She 's smart . Winlock women do not need memories , sweet or sour , but so many tons of everyday life out in the weather , pressing for cars to carry it till there 's no room for imagining a holy mission of one kind or another , or for dreams of saving the world . . . . Human nature , Mark ! Human nature 's glassy stuff , my father used to say . There 's no-  | body around here to many Sally because a man 's got to know more than his wife or it 's no go . Anyhow , think this over . Will you ? " In six weeks , Mark , still a curious lavender white , Mollie , the children and the nurse were waving from the Lehigh Valley express to Buffalo . They were calling good-by to Sally , now the only woman independent operator in the anthracite field . She stood waving to them from the spot where the blowing steam had enveloped her and Luke when they had first beheld each other . At her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatened to rough up into a sob , a newspaper reporter stood . " Would you give us an interview ? Kelly of the CourierWitness . " " Thank you so much , Mr. Kelly , I 'm proud if I interest the Courier-Witness . I wish so much I were really unusual . I 'm just going on with what I 've been doing since my father 's death . " " But you own it now  --  transferred in the Records Bureau . " " You do n't say  --  well , I guess you win . It 's hard to say . Oh , yes , it is a very advantageous arrangement for me . . . a business arrangement . . . . Well , yes , I was interested in the foreign language press and public health here in the valley . . . . Yes ? Well , I had to have those pamphlets published . " He continued , " It did affect the mortality rate that year . " " Say , rather it was because Jacob Czarka arranged for the distribution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not die . " Sally went back to the big stone house by the river . She and Janet had made arrangements for closing it . Numbered squares of unbleached muslin shrouded every painting , piece of furniture , and crystal chandelier , making everything the dead white of marble , not the living white of steam or clouds . Then they set out for Mark 's Own . After a light supper , Sally went to bed in her grandmother 's maiden room . She stood by the window and saw the lights of the Coldspring Mine on the mountain , as she had that night her grandmother died . She was proud and glad that she and Mollie had had their way just once , and Mark did not suspect .  | Freeman had even told Mark that she needed a mine , and not all that money . Mark had no idea what a gambler she was . She had about a fifty-fifty chance in the stretch ahead with the country going back to peace and the tonnages for peace not war . Her success or failure did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , labor conditions , the oil fields , housing , construction of factories , shipping . The market and the lack of strikes  --  more than all else it would be that . " No strikes , please , " she murmured . At midnight she rose and sat by the window . The night air made her shiver . She tapped down the stairs , purposely dropping the heel of each slipper on each step , making a gay , sure tap against the deathly silence of the night . She paused at the foot of the stairs . There was the steady little snore from Janet 's room . She fumbled now in Martha 's knife drawer , took out a good serviceable knife , cut herself a slice of bread and then from the corner cupboard in the dining room took the sherry . She went back to the kitchen and replaced the knife . The coal fire in the library was white . With a poker she raked the coals . They glowed fluid magenta  --  fire by night . . . . " He maketh His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters can not quench , neither can the floods . . . drown . . . David Hugh ? David , my son  --  my little son . The sherry and bread seeped comfort through the dark lane of her body and drained off the misery which blocked her mind . She took a volume from the nearest bookcase . On the flyleaf in faded brown ink was " Sara Winlock , 1835 , from her mother . " She read at random : " Why then is this people . . . slidden back by a perpetual backsliding ? . . . What have I done ? . . . My people know not the judgment of the Lord . . . . The pen of the scribes is in vain . . . . Every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness . . . .

Behold I will gather them out of all countries . . . I will cause them to dwell safely . . . and I will give them one heart and one way .... " She must have slept some time in her grandfather 's high-backed chair with her grandmother 's knitting wrapping her round . When she wakened , the first birds were singing in a new day , lovely , fresh and untouched by any of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IX : The Strike in Winter 1925-1926 THE day before Christmas , 1925 , snow was in the air . The valley floor was already white . The clouds were low , in the filtered light ; the woods , one dark monotone . Sally sat at Mark 's Own and looked at the fire . She had read all she dared . The strike had started on September first . Every week since , the operators had said behind their hands , " It can not last beyond the first of next month . They are not so mad as to cut off their own winter market . " But for four months the fans had pumped air through the sixteen empty miles below ground of the Coldspring Colliery . Every day , the fire bosses had made their regular inspections , to prevent sudden pockets of gas and explosions ; this routine was inevitable if the Coldspring Mine was to come safe through the strike and the stoppage of work . The pump had continued and could not miss one single beat . But not one ton of coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason for the monster 's existence had ceased , but it went on eating its head off , digesting , sleeping , breathing , excreting . Life was arrested once more by the Anthracite Coal Strike . From Shamokin to Carbondale the valley lay tense , motionless , as though on a rack . The tensions were pulling tight and tighter while deep within grew the unuttered cry : " Let 's do anything , give anything , take anything , only let it end . " To all those who had a long view , the effect of repeated stoppages in coal production on ultimate market demand was beginning to take precedence of  | any mere profits or losses . Was it part of human nature for men to play like children and draw blood over even the next three meals , if noise of the fight would drive away forever the butcher and the grocery man and the affability of the coal carriers on whom depended the delivery of coal ? So it almost seemed . The price of coal in the preceding months had been doing very funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typhoon is on the way . And now not one ton came up although the world lay open to it . The situation at the Coldspring was typical of every mine in the region . At the beginning of the strike Sally had turned to studying and research to keep her nerves steady . During these last weeks her files of notes had grown by leaps and bounds . The History of the Anthracite Field , Pennsylvania Anthracite in the World Markets  --  each entry in her fine-stroked print writing found its neat place in the steel filing case . Sometime at the end of her life when she was paralyzed or bedridden , she could , she decided , be Mrs. Boswell for anthracite .... She had worked part of every day since September first . It helped . It was her strike-routine and occupational therapy . If her child had lived , she would have charted his weight by the weeks and months on fine-lined chart paper . It was fascinating to realize the life that lay behind the cold lines of the graph of anthracite , neatly charted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been only thirty.six thousand tons . By 1911 , it had grown to more than sixty-nine million tons . Some baby ! Here it was Christmas week , and no settlement in sight . Sally rose and paced up and down the study at Mark 's Own , biting a hangnail . The night before , when she could not sleep , she had thrown away first the coal journals , then the Anthracite Weekly , and then at one in the morning the handsome new bread knife . Its gleam had been too suggestive . Every time she had seen it recently , it had turned her sick . When a woman knew she was living under unusual strain , it was right for her to humor herself by throwing away knives that cost even two dollars .  | The blade had flashed warning to her as definite as the oblique wheel of light through a fog at night at the new landing field across the river from Mark 's Own . After a poor night , she had gone to the Coldspring as usual . She sat at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning , with sheets of figures between herself and Bret Budge , assistant superintendent . They had one more fruitless discussion . " Not another thing we can cut out ? Are you sure ? " she said . " I 've been over it three times with Morris and McMahon both . They agree .... " " Ca n't the pumps rest even a half-hour a day ? " " McMahon says , with nobody working , it ai n't worth the risk of the mine . If there was an inch too much water , the shaft might cave . Think of the cost .... " " The lights outside ? We 're in mourning . It would seem suitable to let the lights burn half-time  --  sort of half-mast , would n't it ? " " If you say so , but it would have a terrible effect , I think . Night watchmen would n't like it . They 're jumpy enough as it is . Wo n't any bank any place extend you a credit for six months  --  except that bank that wants control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have just been watching and waiting for Red Riding Hood to step one step away from Grandpa 's mine . The wolf 's at the door all right , now . I hear him every night . " " Do n't forget the Coldspring made history for this valley . Let the valley stand by just once , " said Bret . " But it never did . That 's the coal industry . Every man for himself  --  devil take the hindmost . " " If you ca n't raise the money , would you go on livin ' here , Miss Sally ? " Her face was overcast and static , her mind sodden . She spoke dully : " If that big city bank should ever take it over , which is what they have planned for so long , I could n't break off the habit of years just by signing my abdication , you know ? I 'd go on caring what happened to it , and to you , but it will not come to that . It will not . I have other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss Sally . Something 's bound to turn up . Those city bankers meet and scrap a couple of mines and then go out and eat a good lunch . I hope whatever ' t is that 's in your mind , you do n't plan to change the setup of this office . Guess you know mine management never gets a chance to make two mistakes . One 's usually enough . " " Except our collective mistakes in the whole field . There 've been plenty of those . " Bret looked puzzled . " What say ? I do n't get it . " Sally opened the top drawer of her desk and looked at the daguerreotype of her grandmother , sealed there since her grandfather 's time . Wide-apart , deep-set eyes full of a grave understanding answered her own . She never saw this picture without a feeling of courage . " Thank you , Grandma . " That afternoon she had done errands in New Hartford . She had bought a short knife with curled tip , pinked edge and a red handle painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen people skating on a flooded patch of the flats far beyond the city dump . Suddenly she decided to leave the too-echoing hearth and go down to the ice . At one corner of the pond flamed a wood fire amid the frozen hummocks of a cornfield . Sally paid her dime to the blue-nosed boy at the gate , and sat on a plank which rested on boxes to put on her skates . Even having her hands grow painfully cold was a relief from her thoughts . She struck out and found she had not forgotten how to skate . After four times round , her blood was warming her heart . Her breath came more easily . All about her were strangers , mostly boys who had pre-empted the best ice for a game of hockey . Far away from the clacking sticks was a smooth bay ' of ice where a lone figure in Buddha-like absorption was making figure eights , backward , forward  --  poised , elegant , aloof . Suddenly she realized it was the perfectly preserved Edward . . . tin deity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire , kneeling on the planking to ease her ankles . As she knelt there , she realized that in the darkness across the river was the Coldspring . She could see its crown against the mountains " ' Ban-'Ban , Ca  --  Caliban . " Once it was a going concern again , all should see what they would see . She  | would assert her ownership , and require of it that it be useful to the whole world , not just a millstone around her own neck . " No more firing .. . At requiring .... " She turned away once more to watch Edward solemnly making his figure eights . Edward had served on the coast patrol of the United States Navy , through the war , on a boat given to the government by his father and definitely too small to cross the Atlantic . Her own husband had died at Ypres . Her brother had been scrapped in the Argonne . Her son had died , his life not an hour long . Blonde saccharine Marion , Edward 's wife now , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and noses and ears . Well , who said she would exchange ? Did n't the old rhyme say little girls were made of sugar and spice ? She struck out across the ice . The lead on her heart eased . She still skated quite well  --  she was not old . Perhaps she was not all through ; perhaps she could survive the number of weeks of the strike which stretched on and on . The great wisdom of the emergency reserve fund , set up after 1902 by her father and built through the years , became more and more apparent to her . But the inroads on it had been frightful during the past months . " Hello , there ! hello ? " It was Edward gliding toward her . " Still skating ! I declare ! " They skated over to the bench and he sat down beside her . She turned toward the fire . He offered her a cigarette . She wavered for an instant , then took it . Edward looked pink and perfect , like a prize baby . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " I 'm planning to go to Bali , for the rest of my days . " " Let 's see , where is Bali ? Tropical island somewhere , is n't it ? " " Do n't you want to come along ? " " Well no , not exactly . " " Do n't you want to leave a life that 's like this valley 's  --  with no comfort , no security , no time to live from one strain to the next ? "  | Sally 's laugh rang out clear above the beveled hone of the hundred skates carving individual ways into an illegible web and texture of silver fabric , framed by the dim velvet of the earth and the night . " Poor me ! It 's kind of you to extend the helping hand to the lone female , once again  --  very  --  and to a potential bankrupt , as well . But , Edward , how could you make figure eights in Bali ? Tell me that . " " That 's so , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woven onto ice destined to melt . " I 'd rather be here , still , than anywhere , thank you , kindly , " Sally said gaily . " After you 're all settled and the linen sheets are turned down in the second-best guestroom , cable . I 'll come for two weeks  --  that is  --  after the strike 's settled . Two weeks of lotus eating . . . deep seas of rest , and fruitful isles of meditation . ' That 's about all I 'd dare allow myself . " " How 's poor old Mark ? " Edward said . Self-satisfaction at his own thoughtfulness , health and social acumen oiled his voice . " Never better , thanks . That 's where I am going before long . They have a second son . " " How old is the oldest boy ? " " He 's six . " " Born after Mark came back ! Took a big chance , did n't they ? " " He 's a strong child , I 'm grateful to say . " " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mollie and I wanted that  --  but he 's William James Winlock and not a junior . Named after his two grandfathers . " " They took a big chance , just the same . " He paused , then asked , " What did they call their second son ? " " David Hugh . " She swallowed . " Hmmmmm-hmmm . Who 's that ? Mollie 's family ? Oh , no ! Now I do beg your pardon . I call that nice of Mark and Mollie . Do n't seem so long since that picnic on Shawnee , does it ? Funny , I remember how busy you were that night . When we were all enjoying ourselves , you had to clean up with a whoosh and a roar . Remember ? I was annoyed . But it did n't take long . Then I remember , when it came time to go , I said , Dash it !  | Now it 's all done . . . glad she did . ' I remember the little things like that , Sally . You realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I like to think there could n't be anybody easier to live with . " " And , " said Sally , " I 'm so hard to live with , there are times when it 's almost impossible for me to get along with myself  --  so it seems things have turned out pretty well , have n't they , for us both ? You should thank Heaven daily , this project of a life with me has not been required . You must often have been thankful for my lack of judgment . " Edward looked embarrassed . " I want to tell you something . I think I can and be perfectly faithful . I do n't know why , but I keep on dreaming of you pretty often , and those new theories would show that means I must want to see you happy and taken care of  --  not so alone , and neglected , as at present . " " That 's sweet of you to tell me , Edward . Thanks a lot . I hope so much I 'm prettier in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsomer than in firelight , " he said , with a burble of genuine emotion . " The way you keep your head up . There 's a lesson in it for us all ! " She laughed again . She slept much better that night .. . January , 1926 At Mark 's Own , little Jeanie Czarka , always undersized , was sitting at the kitchen table . Her old Aunt Janet was putting the last spoonful of hot cooked cereal , liquid with fresh cream , into the open mouth of her small niece . Jeanie 's eyes were like her father 's , wide-set and brown . Her hair was fine as mist , or her unknown great-grandmother Annie Sewell 's . Jeanie was many years younger than her last brother and he was the youngest of the Czarka boys . . . . She was the child of Jacob 's old age . " If my mother wanted to call me Sally , why did n't she ? " Jeanie asked . " Did Father Finnigan of New Hartford put his foot down ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it should be Maria ' after his mother . "  | " Who wanted me to be Jeanie ? " " I did  --  and they would not give in to each other , so they both gave up to me  --  just an old maid . " " Perhaps Janet is my favorite name . " " Is it ? Now that is nice . " " Perhaps , ' I said . " " Do n't say so , keep your thoughts to yourself , my dear . " But Janet looked around to see that no one else had heard ... . Jeanie had an influence in inverse ratio to her size . " Ilrrrmmm .... " The child breathed a long sigh . " I do like cream , do n't you ? " Janet did not answer but only said , as she picked up the dishes , " Now do you want to go out and play or could you help me dust the best parlor ? " " Oh my , I would like to go in there . I looked in last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Janet took a piece of old laundered dish towel and tore off an exact square . " There 's your duster . " In the parlor , the child said , " Can I dust even this bee-eautiful lamp ? " " Yes , if you are careful . " " Last night when mother brought me , and I saw it , I could not speak . " " Yes , you could , I heard you . Little girls must be careful what they say . " " Aunt Janet , I could not speak at first , but at the last . The light from this lamp " ? she clutched her throat ? " made a big lump here . It 's God 's truth . Am I glad I have no stomach ! " " You have a stomach , dearie . It 's just a dainty stomach , not the kind that comes in Coldspring . You ca n't digest as well as the other children . The strike rations do n't set right . " " I am glad . " Strike rations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were shipped in from the headquarters of the Commissary of the United Mine Workers of America . That was the beauty of things now . Union dues from Coldspring might help men on the other side of the Blue Ridge in the Kentucky mountains , in the remote clefts of West Virginia where even the coal was  | quite different from hard coal mined in the Wyoming Valley . The bulky camions on their triumphal tour up the valley spoke the same language as the hieroglyphs in the British Museum which said : " Come over , or we perish . " They came . Men in the anthracite did not perish . There was no Polish pork , Irish pork , Welsh pork , but just pork . " I 'd go back and see my mother , today . Perhaps I would , " Jeanie said . " No . Do n't you like this place ? You must n't go back now . " " Aunt Janet , you do not need a Heaven with this job you have , but I would like to tell Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the milk  --  fresh milk , mind you , and the eggs . My , I would n't dare tell the children there . They 'd come over and sit down and you could not budge them . They would stay , indeed they would , if they knew what it was like at Mark 's Own , inside . And when the night comes and this lamp is lighted , it is . . . it is ... " Words failed ; she merely shook her head as she ran her minute bluish fingers over the fluted gold column of the lamp . " Father is a mean man , " she said . " If he was to know I was here . . . " Words failed again . " He would grab me home and make me eat that pork and those dried beans . " " Dearie dear , he is a just man , and a great one . The people at Coldspring eat beans now , so they can get some milk and a few eggs later on for all the children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so he would n't understand why your mother and I think it is right you should be here in secret , because men do not understand stomachs , or how even good pork can be poison to some if they got dainty stomachs . " I would n't be surprised if he beat your mother for this , or stayed sour a whole week , but she do n't mind a beating if you get a little pink in your cheeks and gain a little weight , and no decent woman would . She is right and he is right . They both are right . " " Both right ? " Jeanie looked at her stolid aunt . In her frail intelligent face , her eyes were far too big . Janet nodded like a court judge . . . . " I said , Both . " ' Into the child 's eyes came a wonderful reserve which said ,  | " I have the truth . I know right and wrong . " She went to the door , which was standing open . The winter wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trick of the genes , had the exquisite bones of her great-grandmother . The wind lifted the wisps of her hair . Her head cocked to one side as she watched a bird , scuttling through the dried grass . Her neck , scarcely the size of a miner 's wrist , seemed like the stem of a flower . " Now , be a good girl . Get on your things . Go out and play , while Aunt Janet finishes up . " Jeanie put on all her own things and went out . The wind was too cold . Jeanie went onto the little enclosed porch behind the kitchen . It was more like a corridor from kitchen to woodshed with a plaster wall along one side . She took her colored chalk from her pinafore pocket and drew a huge picture . When her aunt came out , instead of being pleased she said : " Heavens and earth . " There on the plaster sprawled a great gay drawing . What would Mrs. Rockford say when she got home ? Janet began examining the picture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for limbs . There was a red wagon , like the relief camions of the U.M.W.A. , but what were all the terrible black lines beyond ? Shocking ! Terrible ! Lamb would let her have Jeanie at Mark 's Own at any time , but to bring the organizer 's child here during a strike . . . ! Janet should have asked permission at such a time . Could this wall be whitewashed or painted over before the owner 's return ? Perhaps . Her mouth compressed itself . Certainly not . She had deceived Lamb all her life for her own good , never once to spare herself . Sally came home that afternoon . Janet 's face alarmed her . Sally breathed a great sigh of relief when Janet explained that Jeanie had been staying there and had spoiled a plaster wall . When she saw the drawing , she laughed . Janet said , " I could get the mine painter to paint it over . " " You could not get the mine painter . " " I could get a boy , somewhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , somewhere . Pictures are no harm . Work done by a non-union painter would be . Does Jacob know she 's here ? "  | " Well , he was away in Shamokin when her mother brought her over . " " Hmmm , hmmm ! " said Sally . That night Jacob came home . His wife 's lie about his daughter 's whereabouts turned his mouth to a grim slit . In ten minutes he stood trembling and terrible at the back door of Mark 's Own , and spoke low to his sister-in-law . " Now , Janet , now ! Bring her to me ! " " You would n't have me take her out of a warm bed ! " " Yes . Lend me a blanket , please . . . . " The " please " had a raucous , ultimate sound . Janet wrapped the sleeping child , even putting on the coat and hood Sally had given her . In her sleep , Jeanie kissed her good-by . At the door , the sill of which Jacob would no longer cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us all to Hell . Children here are all mine . . . all Coldspring , the valley , all coal country . If there is a God in Heaven , he will not require her of me . " The wage negotiations dragged on . Newspapers went on reporting the strike . Readers in the metropolitan areas would catch the headlines and say , " Forever striking ! We 'll put in an oil burner next year , that 's all ! " " How stupid . Why ca n't they agree ? Next fall we 'll put in an oil burner and not be bothered . " After more of the strike rations , Jeanie caught pneumonia . The doctor came and did what he could , but he explained to Jacob that he could not save her because her resistance was so low and that she would die soon  --  he could not say at what hour . Jacob stumbled out of his house on Pump-House Lane in Coldspring as though he were blind , and deaf and dumb . He groped his way up the mountain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Less than an hour after he had gone , Mrs. Rockford from Mark 's Own , in spite of the strike , was seen boldly coming into Coldspring from the New-Boundary gate , with the great Dr. Freeman , who was the best doctor anywhere in the valley . Within an hour two women with plain hats and coats and black bags came to the Czarka house . The strikers and their wives whispered that trained nurses that cost six dollars a day were watching  | every breath that Jeanie still drew , but Mrs. Rockford could afford that big expense because they all knew Jeanie could only live a day and a night at the longest . In the wide wilderness of Shawnee Valley , on the third day , Jacob , stiff from his long gin-wraithed slumber , wakened . A seering neglect ailed his Vulcan 's body . He ran his hand through his stubble of graying hair . Then he remembered who he was and that there was a strike on . Then he remembered why he had fled . He turned toward Shawnee . The sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drain into Coldspring . He did not go to his house but to the back of the saloon where there was a meeting that night of the strike committee of Coldspring Village . There he would hear the reports of what had taken place . No one spoke when he came in and took the chair . He called the meeting to order . Then Mike Monahan said , " It 's in order we pass a resolution of gratitude . " A bitter , seasick look came into Jacob 's eyes . He did not speak , but merely gestured with his hand that they desist . Michael said , " Jacob , she still lives . The crisis passed last night , and she 's gettin ' well fast now . You did n't know , it 's plain to be seen . Mrs. Rockford brought two nurses , and Dr. Freeman himself . " His face sank onto his arms . He shook . Then he said , " Go on with the meeting . " As he went out the door , they heard wild , hysterical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they knew he realized who he was and that Jeanie lived . He did not sleep the whole night , but sat by the kitchen window . The first time the night nurse came out to the stove , he stood up like a pupil in school and said , " Anything go wrong ? " Once he rose and recited almost as though it were on a program : " One of the rich has had a heart of flesh like us poor . She had a child . The great world has not changed her . From this night , Jeanie is part hers . " On February 18 , 1926 , came the settlement . Sally laughed at first , and then cried . By the time she sat down to lunch ,  | she was entirely herself . In the afternoon , she and Bret sat in the office and read aloud bits of the comments from the different newspapers . " The men went back at the same wage as formerly , " read Bret . " But look at the arbitration agreement , " Sally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than this fought about them . " " The Courier-Witness estimates loss of wages at one hundred and fifty million dollars . Anthracite Weekly stresses operators ' losses in upkeep . They say probably forty million dollars lost there , and wait  --  let 's see ? ' operators ' profits . ' " " What do they know about that ? " she put in , tart and overefficient from the long strain . " Here 's an item on the agreement . The operators select one man from the miners ' list , and the miners shall select one man from the operators ' list and the two men so approved shall constitute said board . . . may enlarge board to an odd number in which event a majority vote shall be binding . . . . Agreement will last till August 31 , 1930 . ' " Grandma was only a woman , but not so slow , " she added . " Let 's see ? 1870 ? 1926 ? " The tonnage now leaped like long-pent waters . The week after the settlement , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifts , Sally knew the time had come for her to go down to the Bureau of Mines in Harrisburg and see what they had to suggest for making the Coldspring the yardstick or guinea pig for the entire industry . This had long been her secret intention . Her grandfather had done something everyone of his generation had criticized while he was doing it . Winlocks did n't care too much what others thought of them , though if they were women they never got over caring more than they were willing to admit what people said about their competence in keeping out of an asylum or the penitentiary . With her books piled around her , she sat working in the library . She began copying : " Highest percentage of fixed carbon , lowest volatile contents can be produced from bituminous by pressure and heat , when beds of bituminous are penetrated by an intrusion of igneous rock . At Crested Butte , Colorado , beds of bituminous  | change to anthracite in those portions in close proximity to Basaltic rocks that have been intruded into the beds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled out her diary from the bottom of a pile and wrote : " It has not been just the strain of this strike that has brought me to this decision . It is not . Partly like mists on the river , I began to feel there was more in this mine than met the eye , more than could be set down in red and black ink , more even than the infant mortality rate through the valley the night Father died . " Is there any reason for our being here , beyond love , laughter and tears ? Some days , more particularly some nights , these seem all , and more than enough when one lacks them . Columbus , it seems , if one ponders the journals and fragments that remain , had to present his dream of seeking the new world in terms of practical , commercial reasons , but he thought to find Paradise . The Ojibways had the idea that the Northern Lights are their braves in ritual dance . Well , well , and another well , I must really be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what have we ? I 'm sure I do n't know . But since this Coldspring Mine is my own , when and if it ever comes clear to me how I can hand it over to the state or the Federal Coal Commission or somebody  --  non-political , we hope and pray  --  who can use it as a testing laboratory for the ills of the mining of coal , just count on little Sal with the red hair that 's sure to be fatal luck . " ' When I meet Marion , when I am forced to talk to proud Edward , something very like panic , which will scrap everything just to get away , takes hold of me for a while . Now I accept the fact that New Hartford always looked askance at Markie and me , even when we were very young , though Heaven knows everybody was trying to marry him through the desperate years of adolescence and few  --  very few  --  were after me . " Once I know what must be done with the Coldspring to give it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life ' ? like Milton 's good book , I will patch my clothes and be off on a Johnny Mitchell special at dawn . I shall step light and see all  | when it does not appear that I am even looking . I shall locate my man , and then neither bungling scruples nor humanitarian concepts will alter my course . I shall camp on his trail night and day , whether that trail leads up Mt . Everest or through the Cordilleras . His resistance will be wholly vain . Ho , ho ! I feel lots better for penning this drool , and now I 'll lay me down to sleep . " As she undressed she sang under her breath : " Now me b'long to Union , me good cit-i-zan . For seven year me livin ' here In dis beeg America . Me got plenty money , nine hundred , maybe ten , So shtrike kin come , like son-of-a-gun Me Johnny Mitchell man . " When she got into bed , parts of the books at the office began to rhyme through her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some mental valve was still open and would not close : " **25;433;TOOLONG , pea , Buckwheat Rice-coal and Bar-lee , Rich man , poor man , beggar man thief . Doctor , lawyer , merchant , chief . " The night light on the dresser became frosty and diffused . It merged in majestic gradations into the Northern Lights . These trembled in icy exhalation and moon-like tones across the north . Beneath them spread the ice pack at the North Pole , and yet her mortal eye could see the region and its slope on the vast globe of this present earth . She found herself alone on the polar wastes above the Arctic Circle . It was black night beyond the upper rim of the globe . The only building in this frozen world was the office of the Coldspring Mine . A miniature figure in the vast night , she crept toward it . She was on the section of the globe shown in a panel of the Powers of Darkness fleeing that she had seen in a museum once . She peered through the window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mannish shoulders , a flat chest and a plaid flannel shirt like those the miners and laborers used to wear . In her chapped clumsy hands , she held a folder from a file . From the palpitant night , there came along the Arctic Circle marching men in serried ranks . They were all miners in their blackened mine clothes . Their faces were black as always save for their teeth and the whites of their eyes . Is this Bunker Hill ? But there is no hill . On and on they came toward her as she knelt , unable to move . Their eyes were set straight ahead , and they were dead . A mechanized automatism integrated their puppet-like movement and made them seem further from life than the dead who lie quiet in their coffins . Some went masked in ritual masks made of faded purpling lilies . These masks were made of a texture which moved somewhat at the edges with their motion , striated or veined like petals or the hand of a dead child . A voice , not the voice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What am I to thee ? " In unison they marched . The masks altered and took on the color of the flesh of those who die by methane gas . They loomed tall and taller in their dread advance , their mine boots silent in the powdery snow . A voice , which she heard without mediation of her ear , said , like a lone loon wailing over northern lakes : " Men of Scranton . " They marched five abreast . The last line held a banner reversed , marked with letters in blue gas flames . . . . After the next company had passed , the voice said , " Men of Marianna . " She was counting now as though it had been required of her : " Forty-six , forty-seven , forty-eight .... " At the third company , the voice said , " Jacob 's Creek . " A breaker boy swinging a baton led the next battalion chanting in one monotone : " Cheswick , Cheswick . One hundred and seventy-nine . In our prime . In one mine .... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in globules pocked her face , broke and fell as she cried , " No more , no more . " In long funereal dirge , echoing under the vibrant rays of the dome of Northern Lights , sounded this chant  --  faint , and still more  | faint , though every word came clear , as the ranks disappeared along the Arctic Circle : " American dead , English dead , Pole and Slay . Too deep in the earth for hand of God to save , Polack dead . Hunkey dead . Buried deep in a black coal bed . Who never to themselves have said , for coal to go up an Ashley Planes ; The fresh green earth , no more , we 'll tread . Irish dead , Welsh dead . Men of the mines in serried lines . On polar snow , these exiles go . Sobs at the shaft . The Coldspring Bell . And two cries of a loon is their triple knell . Men of the mines in serried lines . Buried deep in a black coal bed . Dead . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a child named Alexander MacRae had slept one night at the Wyoming Valley Inn . His parents had stopped off at New Hartford on their way to Buffalo to present him to his very aged grandmother in Coldspring . His father had been in the Iowa legislature at the time . The look of Coldspring , which was supposed to be one of the best of the mine villages , had depressed the young Alex , and he was glad then that he lived farther west . During that visit , Janet MacGregor , raising William Winlock 's daughter , told Martha , the maid at Mark 's Own , that Mrs. 1lacRae 's grandson had come . Martha told her mistress that Sandy MacRae 's oldest son had come all the way from Iowa with his little boy . Sally 's grandmother , in a gesture as instinctive as running to a fire , had requested that Alexander be asked to Sally 's first party in the big house on River Street . She wanted to say , " Let cne pair of knees from Coldspring Village itself bend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The years passed . Alexander MacRae had long since turned into a three-star boy . His father was not only an able but an honest lawyer , and his mother an indispensable citizen who could always be counted upon to ask for money for some new civic enterprise or charity , someone who when asked to supply two dozen cakes , always brought three dozen . The town in which they lived found the MacRaes really important , and even missed them when they died .  | It seemed appropriate to this town that their son , Alexander , should be outstanding , one of those brilliant burning boys who are always first in their class , captain of the football team , leader of the band . He had gone to a state university and done well there , too , not quite president of everything , but still outstanding . In the engineering school he came into his own again , with dazzling grades and great promise . As he was growing up , on certain gray afternoons his mother would be overtaken by a somber mood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his school medals and grades if he had once , only once , loved her better than himself , if he had had even two selfless moments when his mind was sufficiently quiet to make possible the floating in of some revelation , some comprehension in regard to life 's quality outside his own success . But Alex 's ambition was about as one hundred per cent his guiding drive as is ever the case with an individual . He was able . He was brave , and as honest as his times went  --  no more , no less . After graduation from the Columbia School of Mines , he had taken a splendid salary for a temporary job in the worst climate in the world . The other two engineers who had preceded him had both been carried out on stretchers . One had died , the other had gone back to Nevada , scrapped , at thirty years of age . One reason that he went to South America and kept his health was that ordinary temptations of ordinary men did not touch him if they interfered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had an integrity , a deadly something which , if sometimes unrecognized by those with faulty emotional equipment , made him so eminently marriageable that he had become used to being considered a catch , whatever the social attitude . He had bloomed for all , and had never really been burnt by anyone whom he would have considered marrying . One wild wild night in a summer when his mother and father were away , he had wanted a girl behind a counter at a gas station enough to violate her , but the Scotch pattern of an avenging God and a calculating streak which told him it might ruin his future , prevented it ; this was the only time in fifteen years when there was danger of a runaway and Pan 's hoofs put their small cleft prints in him indelibly as tracks of the lizards and newts in coal .  | Through the first decade of his working years , some suitable new person was always falling in love with him and this insured pleasant times always at the periphery of his life . After his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that oil companies had a way of squeezing men like lemons . When they had all his reports and all his own private and highly valuable ideas , they decided that the maximum output would be enhanced by new blood and , for their next exploration , they would take not Alex , but the outstanding honor man of ten engineering schools . He resigned . He discovered that corporations with their life beyond life were , when it came to a showdown with any individual , possessed of undeniable advantage which was like the advantage of capital over labor back in the oil fields and mills he knew firsthand . They had the tools , they had the credit , they had the franchises . If even the most brilliant engineer in the world wanted to have a difference of opinion and a row , he could have it any time , but there was just one way the battle would be settled . This dawning conviction went far to sour and discredit his entire youthful philosophy with which he had got so far . Personal competence was not everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hint money or continuing success . Coupled with this embitterment was the perfectly definite picture of how he must marry . He would choose a woman with real social position , the sort that opened all the doors , knew the directors who sat around the circassian walnut , determining policy and order of precedence . Then she was also to have money of her own . He knew as well as he knew anything that it would be at his disposal . With these two things  --  plus his own brains and record  --  he would be a match for any oil company going . Then too it went without saying she was to be good-looking and perfectly healthy and capable of producing with his co-operation , at his pleasure and only at his own pleasure , splendid children . Obviously this was his way out . He got himself a job as an undersecretary in Washington  --  certainly a propitious first step  --  yet through the summer heat and autumn haze and winter dampness , he was not happy .  | He was not sick , but nothing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurants , after years in the desert or jungle somewhere , had at first seemed no small reward , but life now had lost its savor , was flat , and without wind , current , content or ? what was worse  --  anticipation . The woman who was paying him serious attention at the time was all right , but he did not want her . She had the money but not quite the position ; she had some charm but not enough . The time was approaching  --  he heard its warning step  --  when there would be some taut moment , which would mean avowal or withdrawal , and then all to do again . This game in itself was palling , too . He had not slept well the night before . The ashman clinking early cans had jerked him awake and he had not been able to go back to sleep . What if someone , beautiful as a boy 's dream out of a fairy book , were fast asleep beside him when he wakened ? But women were not like that . Their hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their faces without makeup were probably appalling . Of course , there were a few like his mother who wore frank straight gray hair . . . and no perfume , ever . He remembered about her the fragrance of laundry aired in the sun . His father had been working in a factory of the McCormick Reaper Company and studying law at night school , when it had closed down one week before they were married ; but they had married . All they had was forty dollars in the bank . ... Those were the days . . . . Now their only son could not imagine his mother without his father , nor his father without her . Never before this gray and damp morning had he seen anything not directly concerning himself with such clarity . . . . It was like the sudden look into a microscope . " I will arise and go unto my father . . . " came into his mind . Go back to Iowa ? Never ! Here his beautiful cruel mouth curved into a smile at himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pondering the contentment of an obscure father . He himself had been pointed out as the example of what every American parent is supposed to want , an A Number One bright boy , but the cards and invitations which built an unstable sort of tower up one side  | of the mirror of his dresser had suddenly no more nourishment or flavor for him than husks . The thought of his mother 's gingerbread made him suddenly hungry , yet faint . Iowa ? Never . He rose , took a shower , shaved , put on clean things . He looked at his reflection in the door-mirror ; it was about as perfect as anyone anywhere . He had cut himself under the ear , however . The cut bled . He was so severe with his buttons that he tore his shirt , and he threw away the whole thing . The magazines were full of the suggestion that if one would only give up coffee the morning would not be a nightmare . He would go without coffee that morning , try it for two weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would n't give up that ; it never did him the least harm and made it easier to be charming and almost charmed . Without the fillip coffee gave him , he was making his way across a vast mosaicked lobby to his own particular office in a government building . Out of the corner of his eye , he saw something dark and undulating like a black swan , at the edge of the pool of milling people . He stopped , drew to one side and lighted a cigarette . It was a woman in lusterless drapery , moving smoothly with the current . Hell , probably a typist . But he followed . She stopped at the information window . He was close enough to hear a voice the like of which he had not heard  --  low , infinitely modulated , resonant . he followed her into the elevator and stood behind her . She came only to his shoulder and was slight . She had naturally curly auburn hair . He had not seen her face , and yet  --  it was probably lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost as it had at the declaration of war , when he knew that if he went he might be killed and his precious life and all his plans would be at an end . . . but he had gone . She stepped off at the third floor . He followed . She went into the reception room of the secretary of his department . He dodged her , going directly into an inner office . " Is he here ? " he said to the clerk , with a look at his chief 's door .  | " No , sir , not yet , " answered the clerk . " Has he an appointment first thing ? " She consulted her calendar . " Yes , sir . " " Let me play office boy for once . He has often asked me , you know . What 's her name ? " " Yes , sir . Mrs. Rockford . " He went into the reception room by another door and stepped toward her . He put out his hand . The stranger put her slim gloved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled off the glove  --  from her left hand . Sara Winlock Rockford , in trancelike absorption with her errand , experienced a fleeting irritation which merged into amusement at the brilliant egotistic underling who thus waylaid her in the bureau office , and talked to her in an aimless and superfluous way . He was obviously a man with ability and one who would doubtless make his mark in the world among those who still believed in the marking system and wanted theirs high . Then his chief came in ; she turned absent-mindedly without giving any sign by glance or intonation that she had noticed the talkative man or anything about him . In the chief 's office , Sally said : " I happen to be sole owner of the Coldspring Mine , located near New Hartford in the Wyoming Valley , in Pennsylvania . I am without dependents , and I have enough to live on . I can humor myself by doing what I like . I need your help . In a scattered way , I know something of the development of the industry as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the long revolution which set in with the introduction of machinery a century and more ago . The one-room tenements for five , in England and Scotland , with only one window and the stairs going up into the tenement above , have been quite a comfort to me to remember . The houses my grandfather built in 1849 , each one with its privy and a sleeping attic , were very modern for their time and stand to this day . IIe was not bound by the past . Well , I want to give over the Coldspring to the Federal Government for you to use as a guinea pig or a measuring rod by which the  | conflicting claims of the two sides of our perpetual war , which we have always with us since the shafts were sunk , may be brought out into the light of day . The waste that goes on in the coal fields seems to me to be equaled only by the amount of government money wasted in long investigations and reports , the findings of which are never available at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Think of the cost to taxpayers of these inquiries . If the government had an experiment station against which these diverse claims could be measured , they could make decisions at the time of the trouble and be useful in a just settlement . " That is the life I covet for the Coldspring . Help me to find some legal way to make this gift . Please . " She handed him a sheaf of figures and smiled her best smile . No one knew how to smile better than she . The chief 's considered expression ranged from astonishment to hostility and back again . He riffled through her figures several times and finally answered : " This proposal is very interesting and does you credit . I see no hope whatever of the government going into the business of mining coal . You do not quite see all the implications . Our system is based on individual enterprise and the rights of the individual . Freedom from taxation alone would give governmentowned mines so great an advantage that what facts could be gleaned from an immediate check-up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insecurity which the establishment of even one experimental mine would cause . " I do believe that the Bureau of Mines of Pennsylvania might work out some method of cost accounting for you to follow , so that your books , always of your own privately owned mine , might be valuable in further hearings about mining problems . " " Past records are less useful in anthracite mining than in any industry , " Sally replied . " It is only the record of the preceding few months that can be of much use . Take , for instance , this year . One would have prophesied that 1926 was bound to be a low-tonnage year , since the first thirty-nine working days in January and February were missed , and the loss for that period was at least ten million tons . But not at all . If our records for  | the last three months are typical  --  and they are  --  the tonnage for 1926 will exceed the tonnage of 1925 by about thirty-five or forty per cent . Anthracite is less volatile , chemists tell us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem like a government bond . " I 'm not without friends in Harrisburg . We have tried there . The State of Pennsylvania will not hear of mining coal either . I would never have thought of coming here , if I had found success in my effort to get Pennsylvania to take it . " Gathering her pride about her like a garment , Sally rose and left the office . In the park , the Japanese cherry trees were in bloom against the gray day . Spring came at least six weeks earlier here than it did along the Appalachians where the huckleberry leaves and sweet fern , the bay and the indigo plants , were putting forth their doll-size still-folded leaves . Only arbutus was ever found when snow still streaked the higher ravines . Sally sat beneath a flowering tree , eased and subdued by the softness of the air and the lotus-like inertia that had overtaken her now that she had accomplished her set and clearly discerned duty . The sun came out ? irresolute , intermittent , and then to stay . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it . She lighted a cigarette and smoked it , like an abandoned woman on a park bench . Little girls not yet in their teens who went past her might be corrupted by the sight of her . This was an imperial city , with its white marble columns against the ever-changing seasons . The sky became limpid , the heavy ceiling dissolving into frail wisps against the bright azure . How kind the sun was , once it was given time on the shoulderblades . In her lap lay a cheap edition of Hamlet . She must find that one passage and then smoke some more . . . regardless of any responsibility for the habits of little girls who might see her . The pages rustled through her fingers . Here was the passage . It exactly memorialized David Hugh Rockford . She had never once since his death thought of him without turning those thoughts away , so the hurt of his loss would not become intolerable . For the first time she was allowing herself to think of him freely , without that resolute turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought could hold .  | She read : " Exposing what is mortal and unsure To all that fortune , death , and danger dare , Even for an egg-shell ... . The imminent death of twenty thousand men , That , for a fantasy and trick of fame , " ? the British Empire was always fantasy to her ? " Go to their graves like beds ; fight for a plot Whereon the numbers can not try the cause , Which is not tomb enough and continent To hide the slain ? " Looking back toward the Lincoln Memorial , she understood for the first time with her heart what she had long accepted as fact : that the innocent gave up sweet and blameless days , sun , rain , love , food , sleep , for collective guilt . Her husband had been six feet two , and blond , with a laugh that made her heart turn over . Few men were as tall . That black-haired egotist , who had met her that very morning , was tall as David , but rigid and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Funny , that was a good Coldspring name . He had Scotch eyes too , blue as Grahams ' or MacGregors ' in Coldspring . Alex sat in his own office . He would sweep her from the tablets of his thoughts as the professional window-wiper at that moment cleared a pane all frosted with cleaning fluid so that he could no longer see the Washington Monument , cold , lone , single , magnificent object soaring into the empyrean . The sight of Sara Winlock Rockford had started the equivalent of a brush fire in him , but even in his translated state traces of his former self remained . Instantly , in an almost crushing efficiency , he had found out all about her present situation by asking his chief a series of unlikely questions . He found that she was from the Pennsylvania valley from which his father had come . By some judicious telephoning he made a methodical investigation of the Coldspring Mine itself . So she was a Winlock of Coldspring . He remembered now that he had met her as a child , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That early visit to Pennsylvania had given him a terrible two days . The sight  | of Coldspring Village and its poverty , of his warped and wrinkled grandmother living there , and then of the fairy-like little hostess , fragrant as a rose-geranium with sky-blue sash and marvelous hair . He knew now that she had the right to her " honorable , " that she owned a mine  --  a very , very good one , and that she was widowed . Something equaling the Appalachian revolution was changing his carefully graphed charts for his life . She was better off than he was . That was an intolerable objection . Ile forgot his own specifications for a wife . What sight of her had done to him was real . On her return from her unsuccessful trip to Washington , Sally went straight to Mark 's Own and sat down in the library . She was too tired at first even to telephone , but she finally pulled over the instrument and spoke to Bret . " That you , Bret ? Well , you win . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over again . Better you did n't go with me . And yet I felt I must go and try ; knew I 'd never be content if I did n't try  --  I am determined . The time to do it is when things are booming as they are now . " How was he ? Oh , quite pleasant . He looked at all my figures , and said the Coldspring was a very valuable piece of property .. . but he said it would take a special act of Congress , or an amendment to the Constitution or both , I forget  --  anyhow it would take months and months and could never be done , anyway , because you know it would stir up all private owners and they would scream Communism . " Communism . . . ? Had you thought of that ? You had ? Funny , I had n't . Of course , I knew owners and New Hartford would n't like it . Coming over ? You must ? Then come . " Past eleven that night , in the same dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day , Sally went over to Coldspring with Bret . She sat now by the body of James Petrasky , aged seventeen , killed by a fall of rock in the seventh level of the Coldspring Mine that day at noon .  | The boy 's face looked bleached when the coal dust was washed off . Now he looked ready for church . Sara 's own body had never known ease all the years that she lived . It excused at times her recurrent longing to die and lie tranquil . With the weariness of travel upon her now , this longing surged . If only she could have been the one .... " No more requiring to fetch in firing " for him now . If she could have taken his place honorably , at that moment she would have . The first tree frogs from the meadow sounded . Voices from the crowded houses , the clatter of dishes and pans , faded far and far . Silent voices with words from the past drowned out the near voices . " Thou shalt not follow a multitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppress a stranger . " James Petrasky 's father had come from Galicia . " For ye know the heart of a stranger . . . seeing ye were strangers ... " " England , my England , " came her response . " Six years thou shalt sow thy land and shalt gather in the fruits thereof . But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still that the poor of Thy people may eat . " .. humbled thee , suffered thee to hunger , fed thee with manna . . . that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread alone . . .. " She leaned over now , putting her hand upon his , with the blue powder marks , cold and dead . With her left hand she was pressing the middle pearl of her necklace hard into her breastbone as though she must bury it there forever . The voice came again ... . " The state will not take your mine . The Federal Government does not want it . Give your mine to the heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moth and rust ? necklace , wedding ring , necklace ... " She shivered . Her clothing felt clammy against her skin . Before her lay the latest victim of the Coldspring  --  cool , quiet , aloof , with no word of blame . His body lay there  --  his soul was marching on  --  along the Arctic Circle with men of Scranton  --  Cheswick  --  Jacob 's Creek . . . . Two weeks later the only notice of the change of ownership  | of the Coldspring Mine was posted like a fire-board routine at the foot of the shaft : " Mrs. Sara Winlock Rockford hereby gives and bequeaths with interest paid to date , and without debt , incumbrance , lien , or mortgage . . . to be owned by the employees of the Coldspring Colliery according to the pay rolls as of May 18 , 1926 . . . to have and to hold forever such property consisting of the colliery , pump house , fans , the houses in the village of Coldspring and the property totaling three hundred and fortyseven acres , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock the men , still in their work clothes , with Bret Budge and Jacob Czarka at their head , gathered to accept the Coldspring Mine from the hands of its owner . Sally spoke to them briefly . " When I leave you , for soon I shall go away , I leave part of myself . Always it will be so . The labor here of your fathers and mine , your courage , your labor , are still my birthright and yours , my pride and yours . The world day by day is still in the making , the mountains made low , the valleys exalted . . . . We who blast coal have helped in our time , with your line of medals in the office and our crown shining as it has through the years . One man in The Pilgrim 's Progress said , My sword I leave you ? my courage and skill I leave to him who can get it . ' This mine is now yours . The courage and skill have been yours always . Godspeed , men of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Spring came on tiptoe along the misty mountain , as it had in Sally 's childhood . Yet the first owner who had given away a mine had to keep the press silent . Her picture was not taken . She refused interviews except for the foreign language press and one interview for the labor press ... . In countries where the tendency was toward the left , she was featured as few movie queens have ever been featured . She was painting now , every day . She thought about Mark 's and Mollie 's new son whom she had not seen . They had four children of their own , and Mark was even doing a half-day 's work . It was very pleasant to think the Winlocks of the Coldspring were going on somewhere else and that the Coldspring might have a longer life than some of the other mines where the royalty returns had been more sensational in her father 's time ... .  | The days slid along , quiet as sailing ships in the sea . It was very quiet for one whose life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the front door broke the peace . Janet 's knees were bad , their only maid was out . Sally laid down her paintbrush . Without removing her smock with here and there its rainbow stains , she opened the front door . Without was a tall stranger , yet someone she had seen before . She was looking down and not up when she swung the door wide , for he was standing at the foot of the steps with the slope of the meadow stretching to the river at the back . " How do you do ? " she said , finally recognizing him . " You have come too late , sir . The matter is settled . I no longer have any mine . " " I have come , " he said , " to see you . " " Mr. ? Mr. ? ? " she stammered . " Alexander MacRae , " he said . " I 'm tired . " The silence lengthened between them . The saw-like buzz of a locust carved it . The far murmur of the creek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crushed need and manacled longing of his entire life in his eyes , he said , " Here I am . " In July , Sally announced her engagement . The New Hartford Courier-Witness said : " The engagement of Mrs. David Hugh Rockford of Rockford Ashe , Lincolnshire , England , who was formerly Miss Sara Winlock , daughter of the late William Winlock , president of the Ajax Iron Works and owner of the Coldspring Mine , and Celestine Sewell , daughter of the Reverend Matthew Sewell and Mrs. Sewell , has been announced to Mr. Alexander MacRae , vicepresident and general manager of the Sexto-Grande Copper Company , operating in Ecuador . " Mr. MacRae 's family came from Scotland in the last century . His father was a lawyer in Des Moines , Iowa , and a former member of the state legislature . His mother was Miss Annie Morris of Marietta , Ohio . " With the usual delicacy of the Courier-Witness , his intimate  | connection with the late foreman of the Coldspring Mine was omitted . " Mr. MacRae graduated from the University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held an interim appointment in the Department of Commerce . " Sally had felt alone since she was a child . Then she had found comfort in imagining herself cut off from all living things on a desert island . At first , this had been one of the crimson medallions on the Aubusson carpet in the castle the Winlocks had inherited from their Uncle John . But Sally had never felt herself so passionately pilgrim and exile as in the brief year and three months she had lived at Rockford Ashe in Lincolnshire . Even here at Mark 's Own , where she felt most as though she had the right to live , the upper air had been haunted for her by the shadows of the Coldspring . After she gave the Coldspring to the men who worked in it , she was rid of the haunting voices in the upper air , for she had no more mine . Moreover , she was engaged to be married . She had never once mentioned her English husband or her dead child to anyone except on rare occasions to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been making a visit at Mark 's Own . That was all . Such restraint was not good . She knew it now . It was much better to weep and tell than to let tears drop down within where they had almost atrophied and pickled her heart for all time . Now , if she had not still kept the wistful quality of the unwanted , her openness in telling all her plans would have been almost fatuous . To everyone she said : " I am going to be married to Alexander MacRae , " as though she had never been married before . " We shall live in South America . I shall like that . It will be a fine new country , with everything strange . . . . Oh , no , he 's a miner , too . . . . In copper , that 's all . His great-grandfather was a friend of my grandfather . . . his . . . his . . . " She never said , " His back was broken in the Coldspring , " but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first fire-boss . . . . Alex has been in the Bureau of Mines in Washington so I never had to ask if he knew his job , you see . . . . He 'd have to , would n't he , for me ?

Wait till I ' phone Edward and Marion ! What 's he like . . . ? Wait till you see . . . . Tall ? . . . Six feet one . . . no , black hair . . . and nice eyes .... " Janet asked cannily , " Is he selfish ? " Sally replied , more than half in earnest , " Very , I 'm happy to say . He will look out for me first , and never be more considerate of others when my comfort 's at stake . If , that is selfish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Arch Sewell 's release from prison came too soon for the Anthracite Bank which held the fragments of a bag known as the Culmtown Company . The directors even instructed the floor man to warn them if he came into the bank . Formerly the doors had flown open to him almost as though by magic . The directors need not have worried . Arch did not come . When he slunk off the train at New Hartford , he looked around the Public Square as though he were dizzy . He glanced momentarily at the columned facade of the bank and remembered the loans he used to get , and realized that now he needed some pajamas and even toothpaste . The allowance his niece had sent him was n't pin money for a schoolboy . He boarded the trolley and got off at Mark 's Own . He must scotch for good and all the horrible rumor which had reached him that his niece had given away the Coldspring Mine . If her brother could not be induced to commit her , he would get out an injunction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insanity , possibly even give him some guardianship of her coal properties . No man was better qualified from a financial point of view . The trolley scrunched and bumped and stopped and stopped . The people were intolerably vulgar and smelly . Sweating miners were actually riding ! They were spitting beneath the sign that said in three languages the fine for spitting was two dollars . The mucus , all black with coal dust from hours of breathing in a mine , got on one of his London-made Russian leather shoes .  | At Mark 's Own , he plodded up the lane beneath the Gothic elms . After what seemed a long time to him , he reached the stone step and rang . Aging Janet , in black silk and a pleated white-lawn cap tied under her chin , opened the door . That step was an historic spot . Yet a pair of eyes above mute lips had never spoken more than at the moment when Janet , whose life had been Sally 's , looked into the ravaged sunken face of the once-arrogant and ruthless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever lived . " Sorry , no one home , sir . " She started to close the white paneled door , then thought better of it . " If you sit on the bench there , I 'll bring you a little cherry bounce , " she said . " It 's a pull up the hill . " She did close it farther now , but there was a step on the stair . His pointed old shoe was firmly over the sill . Yes , his niece was coming down the stairs . Hat in his splotched and shaking hand , he kissed her hand with a ghoulish effort at a Don Juan manner . " You 're looking better , Uncle Arch . Come in . " He was elated that his niece led him past the drawing room into the library . He sat down in one of Sara 's old chairs , the one in which Mark Stone had done most of his studying by the fire . It had been somewhat sacrosanct and apart even in the minds of his grandchildren . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days , " he said , " until I find my feet and hear from a couple of projects that I have on foot just now . One particularly , I think , will be the best investment I have ever made . I might let you in on it , Sally , if you had a little you needed to invest . " " I 'm pretty short of cash myself right now . I 'm leaving on a little trip tonight at seven , but you must stay for supper with me , and through the week . " " What 's this I hear about the mine , Sally ? " " I have given it to the employees , " she said , " and they have accepted it . Things are , going well , now , thank you . Record tonnage now , as you know . As for me , I 'm busy on my trousseau . " He swallowed and then cleared his throat .  | " I am going to be married very soon , now , Uncle Arch . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been known to . " " That 's indecent . It 's different for a man . He 's so dependent . " The telephone rang . She went out . He leaned over and picked up a book lying face down upon a fluff of silk and edging draped over the sewing basket . It was in her handwriting , but it was a notebook and not a diary . Poetry . . . . He had noticed these exceptional people were likely to have their own erotica . He had n't bothered copying his , but had had it in print under lock and key . His hand would not be still . He held the notebook at arm 's length . Then he adjusted his eye glasses . All this took time . Now the print came clear before his rheumy eyes . His trembling lips half-formed the words . " He that is down need fear no fall , He that is low , no pride ; He that is humble ever shall Have God to be his guide . " He read on , perhaps it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second verse . Then he read : " Fullness to such a burden is That go on pilgrimage : Here little , and hereafter bliss , Is best from age to age . " JOHN BUNYAN " This was more proof for a lunacy commission that she had no more mind than a child . Too bad , too bad he lacked strength and funds and . . . pshaw , should a prison offense mean anything to anyone who knew conditions in Pennsylvania and what went on in the coal fields ? Bunyan ? Had n't he suffered an unjust prison experience , too ? Or was he blind with daughters that would read to him whenever he asked them ? He lapsed and began talking to himself as though he were alone , as he had done in prison for hours at a time .  | " Miss Sally , " Janet spoke as though she must have spoken at least twice before . There was that shade of patience in her voice . " My brother-in-law , Jacob Czarka , is here . " Sally , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt that she was standing in a prison . Even the shadows in the orchard were bars across the grass . Now had come the moment when she would know her sentence . She went along the narrow entry which led from the old house to the one Mark had built and through to the wide front stairs , without one glance into a mirror , or one touch to her hair . Massive and quiet , Jacob stood gazing out of the drawing-room window . His thick gray hair was still vibrant ; his face bronzed and furrowed ; his eyes were fiery and tranquil at the same time . For many years the valley had said , " Jacob is a great man . " This stream of adulation had not tainted him with complacence or overconfidence . He still lived in his mission . " Miss Sally , " he said as she entered . The organ tones of his voice were the outward symbol of his caliber which not even his worst enemies had ever dared to question . In his smile , as he looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most tears . " How are you , Jacob ? " she said and stretched out her hand . " Miss Sally , " he said again . Then , " You have tried to do the right things , right along . We know that . It does n't seem fair to trouble you now  --  now of all times . " " What is it , Jacob ? " she asked . " The Naramoki Mills canceled their fall tonnage this morning . " " What ? They ca n't ! It 's been ours for forty years . " " Well , they say communism . ' It 's enough . For three weeks , orders for fall delivery have been canceled all over . " " That publicity ! Oh , that publicity ! I tried not to have a line of it ! Producers ' co-operatives have been working successfully for dozens of years abroad . Why , the idea is fifteen thousand years old . The Trobrianders , Rochdale ! Jacob , Jacob , it 's all yours  --  all now . I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live on ! I am going to be married . "  | Jacob wrinkled that fine forehead of his . . . . He looked suddenly like the portrait of her great-uncle . " It 's the railroads , too , " he said . " Our quota on cars is way down . It was short again this morning . The railroad says , Mistake . . . do n't know how it happened . Some mistake , some clerk down in New York .. See ? " He moved his heayy-set shoulders in a Slavic shrug . " We offer you the job of assistant superintendent and pray you to take it . We would sign to pay you five thousand dollars the first year . Bret Budge set the figure . It seems high , but you can see we got ta have you back . It 's that or we 're through . Winlocks have got ta be on the bills of lading if we 're going to last six months . I think we could get back the Naramoki Mills , and we could fix things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not red . You stay  --  or the game 's up . The Central Committee of all the Labor Unions is asking you . It 's more than the Coldspring at stake . It 's important for the whole anthracite industry . Sally stood quite still , her trembling hands clasped in front of her . Again she saw that wide compassion in Jacob 's eyes . But he went on inexorably . " I would n't ask you to stay . None of us would , but more 's at stake here than ourselves . A man who knows the figures can see that . Oil , bituminous , electricity , West Virginia  --  they 're all cutting in . " He shook his head . " If we can run the Coldspring together , every man in her out for her till Hell freezes over , like we been doing , we might get some place and show the world they could get coal without scabs , phony finks , and spies . We could go on . We got pride since we own her . We  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back any experiment any place , but we ca n't handle New York capital , and big mills in Massachusetts , nor own railroads . . . like the mine owners did . Eleven hundred men own one mine  --  that 's all . Just one . If the world can believe it 's part Winlock still , we can make a go of it . We got pride now . Once we lose our pride we 're licked . Who knows how long it would be before we ever try it again ? More at stake than just the Coldspring. "  | Chapter XI : Sally 's Own 1926 AT TEN O'CLOCK the following morning , Alexander MacRae stood two feet from Sara Winlock Rockford on the other side of the garden gate . He was not so tall as David , and more spare . He moved with far less ease but with a disciplined lack of extra movement which always pleased her . He had strong , sensitive hands , wonderful in their way . . . harder to forget even than David 's . His bearing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure of themselves , completely happy , were more relaxed and at ease . She could see that he trembled , that it was not merely the queer waves which came across her own eyes . " What did that telegram mean ? " he said , leashed , ready to take her at the first permission in look or gesture . Her own hands were shaking on the gate of the rose garden . She did not look at him . " What it said . . . . I ca n't go .. . now. , , " When ? " " I do n't know , perhaps by spring , perhaps next fall . I ca n't know . I ca n't leave , that 's all . " " Leave whom ? " " Here , " she whispered with an abortive movement of her right hand . " Whom ? I said . Did you hear ? The mine ? That 's not so . " She gave one single nod of assent , and swallowed . She looked at him . There was a tremor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were pressed tight .  | " I wanted you , " he said in a constricted voice , " even after you had done something so nearly insane . Some could n't have forgiven your lapse when you gave away your inheritance . " She lowered her head once more in assent . Her left hand seemed to grope toward the colliery beyond the trees as though it were quite dark . Harshly Alex continued . " It 's not even yours any more . Are you throwing me over for some other fancy idea of martyring yourself into more publicity ? " Her lips shook shamelessly now though she held her teeth tight . She closed her eyes . Her head moved from side to side . " A mine needs you more than I can ? " Her chin sank forward once again and her face stayed almost parallel with the top of the gate . " Fooling right along ? " She pointed to herself beneath her throat . " Myself as well as you , " she whispered . She could see only his hands . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His knuckles were blue-white and shaking . " I 'm Scotch mining stock , " he whispered . " You must trust me to tell me . . . this . " Her lips ached . Her body cried . She swallowed again and did not raise her head . Then she spoke fast under her breath . " Mining men understand the mine comes first . I could be your wife . I could , " she said . " But not now . The mine 's no good to the men  --  orders canceled  --  ca n't get cars . Maybe a year . . . maybe two . . . . Stay and wait , or  --  or  --  go and wait . Ca n't you wait ? " The little gate , frail with dry rot , was all that separated them . Her body pulsed its length to his . His answered . The gate shook first with her hands , then as he put his upon it , trembled with his as she drew back . One push  --  five seconds , and she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigid , its distortion parallel with the ground . " Scotch have Hell , " he said , " not purgatory . I choose Hell , then . We know what we can stand . " They were silent . A low sound as of any animal mortally hurt merged up the scale into sardonic laughter . He went .  |p464  " Kiss me once more " beat within her clenched mouth but she uttered no sound . His fierce step waned , leaving her like stone . That night , old Dr. Freeman , son of the first Dr. Freeman , heard a sound at the door . He left his chair by the fire and went to peer out into the lowering night . Rain was falling . He saw there a dog , shivering wet with the rain . " Myra , " he called . " Myra . . . . Prince wo n't go home , can he sleep in the kitchen ? Pretty wet tonight . " " No , he can not sleep in the kitchen , " came back Myra 's warm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside with a look of resignation . As he stood beneath the white light of the Welsbach lamp ( gas was still good enough for him ) his countenance was a face that belonged in a medieval monastery ... . The passage of the same time that had made Arch what he was , lewd as a burlesque , had chastened this other . . . . He turned , but stopped , hearing a step outside ... . There in the dark stood Sally Winlock , her hair black with rain , her face a strange ashen color , and her eyes wild . He took her arm and led her inside . " I threw it in the river , " she said . " It is n't here . " " Pshaw . Was n't feeling for weapons , " he said . " I wanted to know if you were soaked through . Here , sit by the fire . " He brought a worn , old-fashioned sealskin coat of his wife 's and slid her uncertain arms into the sleeves . He fetched towels from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Dick wo n't like me takin ' his towels . He 'll think I poisoned all of ' em in the sterilizer . " He seated her upon a stool , taking her icy hands in his . " Sal , Sal , " he kept muttering as though she had been naughty . " Not this time , " she muttered incoherently , " not this time , but it is justified if your mind 's on the way out , is n't it ? You know it is . You know . For years I have fought the sight of long knives . " " If you plan any shooting or stabbing , try shooting your man in the dark again . I suppose you still have friends on the police force . A gal like you , with hair like yours , can get away with most anything any time . "  |p465  " O God , O God . " Sally 's head was between her knees . " It was Luke then . Now the pumps say , ' Alexander . ' " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added cheerfully . " Got quite a vocabulary . " " I 'm not going to marry him , " she moaned . " I 'm sticking by the mine ! Jacob made me . What Jacob is made me , not what he said , at all . " " They still want you around after you gave it to ' em ? That 's a great compliment . Do n't see how it 's possible . " " No , " she said , " no , " in a voice still far away but nearer than her first ejaculations had been . " Your grandmother had her worries and all about the mine , too . Did she let them get the best of her ? No . Winlocks always act as though everything is forever , or never . You can be sure of one thing : .. everything changes . Nothing lasts ... . Learn this , Sally , it means quiet sleep even with the pumps that say , Alexander . ' Now if you were an ordinary girl I 'd say marry the fella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know . The Bible saved your grandmother hundreds of dollars in specialists and sanatoriums . Father told me about her many times . Once he thought she 'd have to go to a sanatorium , Bible and all , but she did n't . She jumped right into a buggy and saved your grandfather 's mine . So maybe it 's not love 's old sweet song you need , but a steady job . Stay , and hear the real pumps or go away and hear the rest of your life , Czarka  --  Czarka  --  Czarka . ' " My father said your grandmother liked to wash your father 's hands in her sleep because she thought blood of the children hurt in the Coldspring would n't come off them and God would punish her only son . She was n't so far from insane , right then . " " She did ? I 've felt that way  --  as if I carried all the guilt of the world . But that 's less worry than to believe all sins are going to be visited on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gushed . Her face broke . Her face rested against his fragile and diminishing hands as it used to when she was a child , too many days by far , in bed . He went on talking . " Guess you heard of the wild night we thought you were n't going to live ? I 'd done all I could think of . Your father took  |p466  you onto the midnight train on a pillow . Janet came with us . I remember her shoes were all unbuttoned . You were in one of the first incubators in this country at the New York Hospital . Your father and I could n't sleep that night nor the next morning , had to tell each other all the little irregularities of our neighbors and their fathers ' fathers to get calmed down . Incubators were used ten years before in Paris , but you were in one of the first here , after you were six weeks old . So , if you find life too much for you , I 'd appreciate it if you could postpone your exit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken for you , Sally , and your mother chose to die , if need be , rather than lose you . Got to think of someone else besides yourself at such times , do n't you ? " Sally looked over toward Myra Freeman 's table , on which lay a woman 's magazine opened to a marked recipe , a box of chocolates with the lid off , and a detective story face down . She gave a sudden sigh . " What a darling wife you have ! How rested she always makes me feel  --  just seeing her . Could I have a piece of her candy . . . ? " She felt suddenly warm and protected . She heard the heavy tread of the policeman on his beat while the town slept and on the roofs the rain droned . " Of course , " he said , taking a match and lighting his pipe . " Myra ? She 's a nice girl . " Sara looked at Dr. Freeman . She wondered why she had understood so little the exquisite humanity that enabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long words than anyone in the valley . His everlasting banter and light touch appeared to her suddenly as what it was , a frail wicket momentarily open to the tortured and despairing like herself . His days were built of meeting one sickness or accident after another , and had been for all the years of his practice , yet he still found life good and took each man as he found him . Had n't her prime blessing been that he had taken care of her since she was born ? She saw in her memory now Mrs. Freeman 's pouter-pigeon build , her crinkled fuzzy gray hair , her black-kid buttoned shoes , a fresh white ruching around the top of her stand-up collar , the old-fashioned gold watch dangling obtrusively on her chest from a gold bow-knot pin as though it were still in style , her simple  |p467  genuine smile with no nuance or shadow of turning in it , and her brown eyes so nearsighted that nothing in the distance need even exist for her . Dr. Freeman went on talking . " When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one morning and said your mother had driven with her parents to Twin Towers against his orders . He acted as though he would have to execute her or himself before the sun set , that their life together was over . He was intense like all your people , Sally . In time I suggested there was still a ray of hope provided he could pull himself together and not destroy the average nervous equipment of a Sewell , which is tough , by his own lack of self-control . But " ? he paused and drew on his pipe ? " a telegram came saying there 'd been an accident , a runaway horse . I found your mother unconscious and your father the color of soap . " " Anybody else hurt  --  Grandma , or Grandpa , or Uncle Arch ? " " No . " " How was that ? " He drew on his pipe . " Nobody was on the horse but your mother . Having had a child you understand how such a thing could happen . Women have no judgment during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They say , as the weeks pass , maybe this is my last October , November , etc . " " No ? " Her face did not look as though she understood . Then she said , " Yes , I see . " " Your uncle had a spirited riding horse nobody had been able to ride up to that time ? " " What ? " He repeated , then went on ruminating . " I do n't know , but putting two and two together , which is a doctor 's main work in the world , I guess your uncle dared your mother to ride or invited her not to , or some such legal criminality , and then led the horse up to her , when he knew any Sewell would be as good as gone . Some ca n't resist drink , others drugs , some eat and sleep their life away . Well , the Sewell weakness was horses . " She sat side-saddle on a cross-saddle , one foot in the stirrup .  |p468  At the end of the lane , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Poor Mother . " " Eh ? " said Freeman leaning nearer . He was very deaf . " I said , Poor Mother , ' that 's all . " " Anyway , when your mother 's time came , she said , I forbid you to let me live if you ca n't save that child . ' " " She said , That child ? ' " " Yes , " he answered . " My father came and looked at her because I asked him to . His judgment was the best I have ever known . " The best chance we have , ' he said , is the less usual procedure . ' " What 's that ? ' your mother asked . " A Caesarean section , where we take the child without risking the struggle . And it will be a little hard because we have to give you as little anesthetic as possible . . . now , ' he said . " Fool , ' she said , bring me coffee . Do it without any . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done , I think , if you feel that way . ' Then he said , Do you want to speak to William ? ' " She shook her head . Not now , later . If you bungle that child , and let me live ? ' she did not finish . Your father 's feeling for her had changed . She knew it . " " My father was never untrue to my mother , " Sally said . " Not if you and all New Hartford said the opposite . " A sudden smile illumined his parchment-like face . " Your father was a one-woman man , but when his unborn child was wronged , then he was yours . He deserted your mother and was yours to the day he died . " " But I caused Mother 's broken health so that she could n't stand the climate . . . here . I cost her her health ! " " It was n't just the climate . Her going away was always on my orders . Even Markie 's roots in New Hartford were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her son . . . and how much strain your father could carry without breaking . " " If the Sewells are ruthless , the Winlocks try to forgive , but they never forget , " Sally murmured . Suddenly he seemed to remember that he had spoken of this before .  |p469  " The number of children who die here has hung heavy through my lifetime . Your pamphlets in five of their outlandish tongues , given out and handed in , and addressed with a careful Mrs. on each one and the first name right and the second name right .. . well . I remembered the costly fight for your own life . . . when I saw what the pamphlet said . Your mother lost all she cared about , except Markie , and all your father had was you . " Listen , Sal , " he said , " my father believed your grandmother reached her peak when she was running the mine , holding onto it for your father . " Then I remember the night we rushed to New York to put you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttoned up . Sally gave him a sudden look and was about to speak ; then her eyes showed that she understood he did not remember he had told her about that journey less than five minutes before . Now for the first time that night , she became absorbed in some problem outside of herself . It was wonder and pity that a mind like his , with a memory disciplined through eighty years , forgot toward the end . " You 're a smart gal . Did the New Hartford Academy ever teach you about Joseph Smith of Wells , Maine ? " " Did n't he lead the Mormons ? " " No , Joseph Smith of Wells , Maine , thought God wanted him to do just one thing . " " What was that ? " " Knock down the Congregational Church . " " How funny ! " She actually laughed . " He chose the lintel at the side . His Samson act did not budge the uprights . He thought as he went home to his supper , I have overestimated the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission . ' " " More power to Joseph . " " I tell you this to illustrate the point that the New Englander finds within himself his own redemption by way of his sane and brilliant mind . Somewhere in your grandmother 's Bible it says , No man by any means can save his brother . ' One thing the sciences and religion seem to be in harmony about . . . . Nobody  |p470  can save you against your own will . That is how important the will is . I have seen the issues both of life and death , settled by it . " I believe , in my partial and incomplete knowledge , that your safety lies in the dangerous hard life . You would crack far sooner , as a pampered wife , or a clothes-tree for some smart engineer to hang with jewelry every new holiday . Eh , ai n't that so ? You do n't feel tonight that you will enjoy being able and bright and efficient any more , but you will . You will have a satisfaction as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had as its owner-operator because it is the very indistinct trail blazed out of the industrial jungle which is passing . " " If I 'm not keeping you up , then , I want to confess to you ? one more thing , " she said . After a pause he went on , for the first time , now , seeming to speak as much to himself or the night as to her . " Look around . It 's the fliers that crash . In the end , the deserts left by war will come back to the beavers and the meek . Probably wrong though . Probably wrong . No doubt , cowardice pure and simple has kept me close to the ground , a beaver doing the same things every day , till fishing season . . . . At eighty , however , I sense some of the meaning which comes so clear in the transcendental visions of your Great-Aunt Lydia and your grandmother till Mark Stone saved her . . . . Time is the illusion .. . the meaning of life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage to grasp . At eighty , practically nothing matters , but a contented wife with a cute laugh , good coffee , the sight of people slipping on the ice if they take themselves too seriously , believing the world is their oyster to strut on and remake with percussion instruments , a good mattress and a decent police force in the town  --  the sentinel elms have kept us from rape and murder all these years . Now , you see old Freeman for what he is , Sal , my daughter . I 'd give all Wagner 's operas to hear your grandmother 's Montcalm sing . " You say you have had trouble . I can see you are the most beautiful woman who ever consulted me on matters of the heart or any other matter  --  shingles , hives , what have you ? Why , you have had the body-sense even in your choice of diseases . You  |p471  never got a rash , now I think of it . Even those from distemper of the nervous system . " " Possibly my prayers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That is possible , " he said . " I used to believe I could really tell a sick patient 's belief in regard to the next world by his pulse and blood count . When I began thinking first of his belief and believing it might alter the pulse and even the blood count , I stopped active practice and had to trust Dick . . . I never admitted this before to anyone . " You can go to bed in the back room presently . . . . There 's a grate fire there . Myra 's got her sewing machine moved in , and plants . " " The room with the red chintz on the camp bed ? " " Yessum . Anybody that Myra would allow to sleep in that bed is too important to hobo around in the rain , throwing good cutlery into the Susquehanna . Next time bring it along . Give it to her , and she 'll think you bought it at Simon Sax 's for her . Remember , the Winlock 's trouble can be cured by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now , I ca n't carry anyone upstairs , but I can kiss you good night . Myra would not like it . It 's her arrested development or wisdom of a child that has made me so happy all my life . " For a moment , Sally looked her devotion . He could not see in it the terror which came from her knowledge that age could alter even a mind as true to itself as his , and trick him into repetitions . Upstairs , beneath the chintz canopy , Sally stared for a while at the ceiling in the roseate dark . One coal dropped onto the iron fender and gave up its life without a single sigh . She pulled the down quilt around her shoulder . The silence hummed like bees in summer , then louder , like the whir of an emery wheel against steel tools . Strange fancies floated through her mind . " Can He who made thine eyes not see ? Can the clay cry aloud and instruct the potter ? The world is mine and Thou art mine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the morning along Neptune 's rings . In the uttermost parts of the sea  --  behold I am there . The Pil-  |p472  grims prayed to be allowed to rejoin the church of England . The little Speedwell sank . The Mayflower came .... Te wheet to who , and who are you ? Fly away , birdie , fly away home .... " Now she was hearing her father 's voice at Mark 's Own after her grandmother had died . It honed from the silence like a steel tool on an emery wheel . " Here at Mark 's Own , It has been known For a long while That life 's not vile .... " No , no , he did not say that . " Not always easy , but worth all it has ever cost , or is going to . . . Sally , my daughter , born to be a blessing . . . Your hair . . . your hair , the sunlight of this house . " " Father , your smile , my Heaven . ... " Her thoughts whirred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he saw blood , cat 's blood , or his own , from a scratch . He came back one of Pennsylvania 's great soldiers . Medals and medals , ribbons and ribbons , none of them on the counter at Simon Sax 's because they can not be bought with cash . . . . You took the mine off his injured heart . . . . It still beats . . . . You did n't cause your mother to die . . . . You did n't choose to be a Caesarean . Freeman decided what you should be . Leave it to Freeman . Father wants you to depend on Freeman . Here at Mark 's Own it has been known . . . . It might have been me , hacking my wrists in self-destruction . " If she ever slashed her own wrist now , it would be like Kelvin Jones in the seventh level . After two days entombment his companion Michael Dobrowsky had drunk mine water and was dying . Kelvin cut his own wrist and Michael sucked the only warm drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why did she not fill her mind with the times men had been saved through all these years ? It seemed as though some people liked trouble . The silence was speaking again . " I believe in God , the father Almighty , maker of Heaven and Earth , and in Jesus Christ his only son , our Lord . . . born of the virgin Mary , suffered under Pontius Pilate , was crucified ,  |p473  died and was buried , but rose again from the dead . Rose again .. . rose again .. . " I have made no heart to find peace though they measure the galaxies and Orion , until they rest in Me . Arise , daughter , the sun on tiptoe along the misty mountain-tops . ' Thy sins are forgiven thee . " Next morning she entered the Coldspring office just as the siren ceased . Janet telephoned . She told her where she had spent the night , and fully understood that Janet would also telephone the doctor 's office to find out whether or not she was being fobbed off with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to coal orders , Sally had time to be glad she had moved from the big house to Mark 's Own , and that Dr. Freeman had been willing to stay and live where he had been born . The sun seemed bright in a new freedom of its own , being part as it was of just another day . The following morning when she went back to the office of the Coldspring , she found a long white envelope on her desk . She opened it and read : " Resolutions presented to Sara Winlock Rockford on becoming assistant superintendent of the Coldspring Mine , the only Producers ' Co-operative in the Anthracite Region . " Whereas the situation arising from the present conditions in the anthracite field has made it hard to compete , when this mine is run on the basis of employee-ownership and a producers ' co-operative , said difficulties have been relieved by the acceptance of assistant managership by its former owner . We herewith tender our thanks . " BRET BUDGE , Superintendent , " For the executive Committee of the Coldspring Mine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She found enough detail to keep her mind busy and challenged ; and now that she was measuring successes and not failures , she found in every day a bread-and-butter content .  |p474  The co-operative started fresh . The new stationery , with a " Winlock , Assistant Superintendent , " staunched the flow of cancellations . She kept thinking now of new advertising and new markets . About a year after her unscheduled visit to Dr. Freeman , she had a dream : She was a child wandering through the pretentious hall of Twin Towers . No one heard her . No one saw or spoke to her . Everyone was busy trying to sleep  --  taking medicine , being massaged  --  but no one could sleep . She was bearing in her left hand a golden bird cage . The top , of metalwork , was wrought like the reredos in the chapel of Rockford Ashe . In it was her little canary which had died because the maid , when they moved into the big house on River Street , had forgotten that Janet had told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cage a little baby , his hand lying by the bird . The child was the color of her own son who had lived one hour and of the child on the train , but it had the eyes of small Jeanie Czarka , those wonderful eyes that said : " Anything , but please , no bunk , ever . " Then across the large hall she saw David in his uniform . With a great leap of her heart she cried : " David , you will get me out of here . " His voice came , stern and grave . His face was clouded . " You will get yourself out of here , or you will not get out , " he answered , in her dream . There was a break . Then she saw herself kneeling before the cage where lay the child and the bird , as though she were dedicating it upon an altar , but there was no altar where she had laid it . She had carried it , successfully after all , far away from haunted Twin Towers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sunlight which came from the French windows of her own room on River Street . . . where dolls or dog were often put to bed . On waking she lay a long time thinking of those squares of sunlight , until there came the fragrance of fresh coffee from the kitchen .  |p475  Chapter XII : " Good Union Citizens 1929 Dusx merged into night . The mountains were black except where the scattered lights showed life . Around each mine the floodlights carved , from the dark , geometric segments of the white and ever-folding columns of smoke . On the long slide of culm against the mountain at Culmtown , the fire which had burned for years made a fiery hieroglyph toward the north . At a drain pipe under the path between Shawnee Mountain and Coldspring , knelt three children in a close huddle . Serge Monahan said , " Hold your nose . Quick ! " He pulled a stone away from the end of the drain pipe . Something streaked , more felt than seen , into the woods . " Saved , saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone ease once more into its bed . A sudden over-powering stench enveloped them . Leaving their homemade derricks , winches , brattice and sticks on the ground , they went down hill , calling , " Saved , saved ! " They rushed up to the door of their house . Their mother stood at the sink with Tomato-Face who was helping dry the dishes . She turned toward the door . " What happened ? " she asked . I-Ier face was strained . " Our skunk is saved ! " they called . " Get along with ye  --  ye  --  " Words failed her . " Go rub yourselves with dirt or ye ca n't sleep in this house . " She turned back . " Why do n't they come home from that meeting and tell us what we know now ? " she asked Tomato-Face in the tone of one who expects no answer . " They 'd whereas and whereunto and  |p476  move motions if we were starving . Why in God 's mercy do n't they come ? " " I 'll take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowl beneath his arm as though it were a banjo . " I 'll go from town to town . I 'll make me new songs of wit about the loves and scandals of that place . Coldspring 's not the only mine . By no means . Pennsylvania 's not the only state , so I 've heard . The skunk is saved . They let it go . There is healing in that . When a thing is over , let it go . Do n't grieve . At the end , Fly to your Maker with open arms , ' as Father Goose used to say , so often . " In the office of the Coldspring Co-operative , the board of directors were meeting for the last time and reading the last minutes . Bret Budge rose and stood in his angled position because of his crutch . He recited a speech he had obviously learned by heart : " Whereas some company-owned mines are in the red to the extent of eight or ten million dollars and still shippin ' coal , the Executive Committee of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short-term deficits by the transfer of future wages back to said co-operative and in due season these wages have been returned . But with general conditions such as they are , we consider ourselves not a failure , but under the circumstances of said wonderful conditions and unparalleled slumping of everything , in good shape . We do not have big banks behind us which can reorganize and whitewash us into spurious and blameworthy earnings , which are mere subterfuges , not to say plain lies . Well , to come to the point , we feel that , since our union wage rate is at stake , it is to the best interest of our Local of the United Mine Workers of America , never stronger than today , that we cease operations . " Here , his voice shook . He avoided saying " of the Coldspring . " " We believe that the noon emergency prayer meeting up the mountain , where with one voice , the men " ? here he did not say " of the Coldspring " ? " voted to go without three weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where hymns were sung and prayer was offered , shows that the spirit of co-operation did n't fail . We done some very valuable things here in running this mine ourselves . While coal is coal and men , men , disputes are part of mining , but  |p477  here we reduced disputes to an all-time low for this field . When a question is , or I should say was , settled , it was settled . It did n't lay around poisonous as blue mold growing into a worse one . " Our book shortage is sixteen thousand , a widow 's mite compared to others . In ten days the orders will all be filled , and we 'll close down . " He scraped his throat and took his chair . He said , " Tomato-Face may read this from the steps if you so move . " They moved and seconded and passed this resolution . Bret then said in a helpless and informal way , " ' Spose you 'd better inform our employed assistant superintendent by telephone , if you do n't mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Outside the Monahan children screamed , " Saved . . . saved ! " Inside the men searched one another 's eyes . George , on his way in to the telephone , went to the outside door . " What 's saved ? " he said . " Our skunk that was caught , and it would have died . " George sniffed . " Damn good bratticers , I 'll say . How did you do it ? " " We pulled away the stone from the drain pipe . " Bret gave a little whimper from strain . George was young and had two good legs . He said , " I move congratulations to Mike Monahan and Company for successful operations . Smart kids . Developed new methods in an unprecedented crisis . All in favor say aye . ' " All said " Aye . " In the dining room of Mark 's Own , in a Hepplewhite armchair that had not been her great-grandmother 's  --  the first Sara had rested on a log through Hepplewhite time  --  sat the Honorable Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sally , Assistant Superintendent of the Coldspring Mine . " She had heard several hours before that her services would no longer be required by her eleven hundred employers . A half-empty decanter of sherry stood before her . She had been drinking . Cyclamen pink blazed upon her cheekbones , her eyes were fiery and confused . Her hair was wild and disordered . She looked up at a worried Janet and said defiantly , " I 've made a record , Janet . There have been very few women operators , and  |p478  not one of them that took a position got fired more than eleven hundred times . " These fairy-like days of coal , though so clever , are the lesser days . Better turn wheels on ships and trains , and keep nurseries warm , as we used to . Always blood guilt requires blood . The Greeks , the Hebrews , I suppose even the cavemen , knew this when they shared their picnics with some jealous God . If anything had to be killed , it had to be a terrible ritual and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead because there was a war on . Grandma 's first son died because Grandpa got caught in the Coldspring . I ca n't explain , but I begin to see . If I kill you , you do n't kill me , but something happens that seems worse to me than dying , or Uncle Arch kills me , for instance . That would be very likely . " " It 's midnight , Mrs. Rockford . If you 'd let me warm a cup of soup and some toast , then you 'd go to bed and sleep . If you sit here , you 'll like as not take cold . " Janet called her " Mrs. Rockford " only when she disapproved of her . " Janet , I have been drinking . I always heard coffee was what pulled you out of a state like mine . But I do n't want to be pulled out . It 's a lot better to drink than go crazy and do something final others will regret . Just have one little drink , Janet , now . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine , ' again , or I 'll throw some on you . If you stand there , you 'll get rheumatism . Go away , will you ? Jeanie 's rosebud cup in your hand , too ! " A lone candle tilted from a candlestick on the table between them , the white wax billowing down unheeded upon the polished wood . Sally looked at it . " Wax going down makes just the same pattern as anthracite going up . How is that ? This may lead to something . " Then she sat quiet , her face in her hands , her elbows on the table . " Janet , Janet . " She did not wait for a reply . " It 's all over with that dog-gone mine . Nineteen twenty-six , seven , eight , nine , almost thirty . . . four long years . . . .

I have been exiled from the bed-wide isle that looms at dusk and vanishes at dawn , a secret pavilion where the anguish of the day is no more . I 'm not a steel file , plugging a landslide for an inch or a second . . . I 'm a woman , with heart and breasts and mouth .

He 's got that worn , resolute look which a whole lifetime of the day 's work gives to our men to make them the wonder of the world , here in America . " She gave an irresponsible gesture of dismissal . " I 'll go find him ! " She moved as though she took up a telephone earpiece . " Hello ! I tended the Coldspring Mine , time and overtime . My dear Mark has four children , and though he went through the war , he has had Mollie some years now . If you still have Alex , I want him , please . Hello ? Hell , cut off . Operator , listen !

All I 'd need would be a rude shack or tent . . . it would be my secret pavilion . Some do live . You see ? You say perhaps he married another . Oh , no . " Here she shook her head . " He is not necessarily celibate ; when a man cares the way he did , whatever he does is to make himself forget . But he does not forget . " For a moment she was still . " Luke-Luke-Luke " ? she was whispering now ? " I 'd have loved you so , maybe some night I would have had to kill you . Do n't ask why . I do not know . Yes , I have understood that our death by starvation for each other may have been God 's extremest mercy . . . and all the while  |p480  I lay with cold sheets the winters through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many centuries back . " She went off again on a new tack . " There is Mary Czarka , who nursed a man with a cancer for a year . I notice she did not want his name . Her son is changing history . My widow 's mite is now dust . Grandma , Grandma , you understand . Veins , coal veins , my veins . . . fire in the veins ... . You alone knew how I could marry , because the Sally that loved Luke was no more . You understood where the boiler is , where the heat must rage safely up flues and be subdued to the uses of life . " Long ago I dreamed I was a gull flying over the ribbed and sliding seas to my love . . . where I in dreams beheld the Hebrides .

" This superb pair of Chien Lung imperial carved Feitsin jade bronze libation vases with covers . . . . Going , going . . . gone . " What am I offered for this eighteenth-century ritual crown ? Five hundred . . . five hundred . . . five hundred . . . " Freeman in a curious impulse which had disturbed even himself had told Archibald what really ailed him . His usual name for it was " glad life 's arrears . " That single burble that came and went in Sally 's voice , disturbed Arch even as he slowly undressed in his bedroom and he had eavesdropped until he heard she was complaining . Just why was she so incredibly selfish as to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had retired he could not attempt to say . " What am I offered for this set of antique white-carved ivory  |p481  elephants ?

" The little children of Coldspring , their new hair tendriling around shell-like ears , slept sound in their clothes-basket homemade cribs . At Mark 's Own , in the dining room , Sally was pounding the table again . " Do women want an equal place for themselves with men in the world ? The position to which their redoubtable brains entitle them ? Not me , nor I. " She rose and stood at the window now , looking at the crown of lights against the mountain . All but that crown was black as anthracite in the candle 's glow . ... " No more children ! No more youths and maidens shall be sacrificed . But we can not forget  --  Moloch ! My Moloch . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the shaft and disappeared toward the east for an illicit prayer meeting in the scrub oak where they had secretly organized back in 1897 . They sang " Jesus Leads " partly because Bret did not like it , because he said it had been written by a grocer who could eat his stock if no one would buy it . In the noon light , their waxen grimed faces and Tomato-Face 's strange countenance were harsh . Their throats were stringy , with Adam 's apples too distinct . Tomato-Face said , " Should I tell the Executive Committee we would work for three months , with just grocery scrip ? " The men from seven countries overseas , on a hill overlooking the top of their black tower of Babel , in one voice at the same instant said , " Aye . " Tomato-Face said , " I will go tell Bret Budge . " But when they went back to the mine they saw the same sign that had been on the fire board for almost two weeks , " Boilers die out at five , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , the clock said half an hour to go . Then the great steam siren of the Coldspring would blow for the last time . In 1850 it had split the valley wide open  --  the iron call to a new world . This last day had been dry and crystal clear , one of those few bright days in December which come after a sudden snow and  |p482  thaw . In the hard light the collieries , mills , and small villages far down the valley shone out , dramatic and irrevocable as white buildings on a small island after the wideness of the sea . At the Coldspring , the clearing was without snow , but it lay pure and unsoiled on the bank to the creek . The waters of the upper stream against the wine-dark leaves that paved the pools looked darker , while the white reflection of the snow made the inky waters from the sump seem whiter even than snow itself . In the mine office Bret Budge , sitting at his desk , moved his one foot restlessly to and fro . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winlock 's . He picked up a newspaper and looked at it , rattled it , then read aloud in a strained voice to Sally : " Sanity and fair dealing marked the administration of the owners . The Honorable Mrs. David Hugh Rockford , of Rockford Ashe , Lincolnshire , England , the former Sara Winlock managed her valuable inheritance for several years . No one has ever doubted her motives in signing over the entire property several years ago to her incorporated employees . And yet even her continued presence at the property has not prevented its abandonment . Meanwhile , during years of increasing pressure and unrest and the rise of the bootleg industry , the presence of this Red Mine can not be said to have been an advantage , but rather a continual embarrassment to employers already beset by problems . Therefore , the closing of this mine must stand as a warning to all those irresponsible men and women who offer swift and untried remedies for evils of long standing in industry . ' Trust that Courier-Witness to kick you when you 're down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the publicity we got for nothing , that first year we took it over from you . " The paper crackled as it dropped to the floor . " Now , you can just listen to me , please , " she said . " I 'm busy , " he grumbled . " Yes , we are both so busy we have n't one moment , I know , but you ought really to hear this . " " Later , later , let me read it myself . " " No , you will listen while I read , " she said in a curious voice too strident to be her own . She began reading from the Anthracite Weekly :  |p483  " It has been known for some time that the Coldspring Colliery has been operating on a practically no-work program . For a good while now .. the owners , who are also the operators of this mine , have been putting part of their wages back each week . ' That 's a nice way of putting it , is n't it ? Putting back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving back is likely to remain permanent and will in effect be equal to breaking down the union wage scale won for the whole valley , through many years of strikes . ' " Bret came and took the paper from her and continued : " For some years back this is the only shaft mine in the field owned and operated exclusively by labor . The miners were fortunate in being able to employ as assistant manager , Mrs. Rockford , formerly Miss Sara Winlock , granddaughter of the original owner of the Coldspring Mine . The weavers in Rochdale , England , almost one hundred years ago , carried on a successful operation on a co-operative basis . Our producers ' co-operative here has aroused wide interest throughout the world . They have received inquiries regarding the working of this mine ever since they took it over . " Officers of the company are on date of decision to close down : Joseph Czarka , son of the well-known organizer , president ; Bret Budge , vice-president and general manager ; Conrad Bercavidge , second vice-president . These last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been employed in the Coldspring Mine . " The executive committee as constituted to date is as follows : Eugene Radzivigone , B. R. Wetzler , James Booth , Zoltan Kurmanky , Rupert Angelo , MacGloughlin MacGregor and B. J. Smith . ' " " Well , " asked Bret truculently . " Well  --  oh , I do n't know . " Sally sat at the quaint swart desk that had been Mark Stone 's from the beginning , in her own specially constructed swivel chair . Her slender expressive hands were lifeless and relaxed , her attitude was abject , in a complete withdrawal from the time and place . Both she and Bret felt a surface relief at being free of each other so soon . They had made such a ridiculous team running the Coldspring Mine . Bret had found her ideals impossible , her  |p484  standards rigid . Many times her lack of comprehension of so much that all men understand by instinct , about getting on with one another in a world of action , had maddened him . As he gazed now at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient , that his self-control had been so remarkable . He had not showed hurry or irritation more than about twice a week . When all was said and done , it would be a relief to see her beautiful and haunting face just once a week in church , instead of facing him every morning . All the mine people in Coldspring felt the same way about her . Her gift to them of her mine had merely served to elevate her to an unreachable level . She had never really been close to them . They did not feel at home with her , but they loved her . He cleared his throat and said , " Are you okay ? " " Yes . " " Guess everything 's finished up in good shape . No coupons , no guessing . " " No guessing . " " Why do n't you run along now ? Take a spin over to the river bank . " She did not answer . His voice became real . " Miss Sally , Jacob and I would never have asked you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have seen ahead and this mishap . We know it ai n't so easy  --  marriage at your age . " You done your best , but a woman ai n't fitted for business , either . " " Is the co-op liquidating completely ? " she asked without relevance . " Yes , in a manner of speaking . Just the singing clubs going on . There 's enough bats in our belfries to keep us going . I might make myself into a corporation . Me , president , the boys , treasurer and secretary . " There was no reply . " Conrad Bercavidge said last night , If people will sell coal below cost of production , nobody in the world can stay in business . ' Ai n't that so ? " Again she did not answer . The ticking of the clock became louder , almost like a barrage .  |p485  In a voice definitely raised , he said , " I see the men of Turkey Bill are bringing lawsuit against the Lehigh Valley Coal Company in Assumpsit . Yes , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , must be damned small . " He cocked his ear for an answer . There was a slight trembling around his firm mouth now . She was still silent . " My young Mike got a chance to sing on a radio program on the National Morticians drive for extended service . Morticians worry over the falling death rate , just like we watch the tonnage . Everybody 's got their worries . It 's life  --  that 's what it is . To take tonnage we sold in the war as a base is all wrong . I always said so . He 's going to sing at Donovan 's funeral parlor . They got the best piano . All inspirational and the decent love songs . " He looked at the clock and showed signs of strain , jerking his head as though a mosquito had bitten him . " I 'll bet they get out some pink caskets for pale people , guaranteed to keep insects out and corpses in before they get through . Specialized service must consider your coloring . Ai n't that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , small and still . " If you do n't incorporate , Bret , would you go on mining coal ? " " No bootlegging for me . Bootlegging has been the answer to starvation by a lot of brave men , but regardless of glozing over with other names it is thievery , even the Anthracite Weekly says so . I always heard there was coal on the ridges beyond the Old Baltimore Mine . Maybe these small operations will be profitable again . Might prospect some . " " How old were you when you went into the ... " " Around nine , but swore I was eleven or so . We all did . We knew at the start that mining coal is seasonal , bound to be uncertain . No job in the world can be permanent . " " It has been a privilege to work with you . " " Pshaw , no . " Glancing at the clock , he reached for his crutch , as though caught in a fire . " Guess I 'll peg out and see to takin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store by it . " As he reached the door , he was still talking like an engine gone wild . " Pshaw , if I do n't incorporate myself , this great state will take care of us . Someway . Give it time . I 'll have time to be a good  |p486  citizen , add a little beauty to this valley . It 's not only run-down , it 's dilapidated in its every appearance . Anthracite Weekly says so . Even in the business sections of New Hartford and WilkesBarre is a real lack of artisticness . " The door closed . His peg leg made the three taps down the steps . The sounds were lost in the cinders , as he took the fourteen steps that lay between the office and the boiler house . She looked at her watch and swallowed . She drew open the narrow drawer beneath the working surface of the desk . She turned back the cover of the cased daguerreotype sealed there . From it looked out the clear eyes of Sara Winlock Stone in her wedding year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , like Sally 's hands , lying empty in her lap . She looked long at the picture . Her lips did not move except for their convulsive trembling . No words came from the faded tin and yet there was communication . " You know our mine . " I failed you , Father , Markie 's children . Grandma , Grandma , what shall I do ? " She felt the silent answer in her heart . " My Mark locked away the bread knife every night and hid the key under his pillow after the death of our first-born . " She had read it in her diary . Again the inner voice cried out , " You had a Mark and a William . What have I ? Grandma , Grandma . " " Born to be a blessing . " " No blessing , ever . " " Blessings come only through ourselves . Come , be Grandma 's good girl . Go back to our wing . Sleep ! Kiss the Coldspring good night . It has served its purpose . Let it go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Part of it lives , secure from fire and rust , in us . " " But Coldspring 's children ? How shall they eat ? Since England , I have known what every child is worth . Each little drink of their water is holier than the Grail . " Radiance from the saffron west touched her desk and made her hands lucent . She looked up . In the open door stood Jacob holding Jeanie by the hand . She stood close , wavering to and fro on her slender feet . fir face , shaped like an inverted pear ,  |p487  was wide at the cheekbones , for she was beaming . Her small teeth showed . She ran to Sally . " I can play a scay-ull , Miss Sally . You give me one note anywhere and I can play the scay-ull from that note . " Sally took her hand and looked at it . " Good piano hands , " she said . " When I was your age I practiced too , playing scales in a special way . You ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the keyboard nine times . I 'll show you sometime . You go up and down nine times and you are right , if you come out exactly where you started . " " Now you go home , Jeanie , like the good girl you always are , " said Jacob . She ran out the door . For once Jacob 's eyes did not follow and cling . He looked only at Sally . " I knew your father and I wish there 'd been more like him . Guess you know . . . what hangs heavy this day . A woman needs a home . " She pressed his harsh and sinewed hand . " I built a nice house for my mother , first thing . She had it hard , very hard . Catherine and the boys  --  they 're all good . Sometimes I think Jo looks like my Uncle Jo . My work I got to do , enough for me till the day I die . You 're a wonderful woman . Your doctor and nurses saved Jeanie , after I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch and braced herself . " The funny part of me is , Jacob , that I have known this moment must come before long , even before the crash on the market that 's tobogganed the entire continent into a slump so deep it does n't know where it is . Nobody can say what is happening in the next few months to industrial America . Records here have made a good showing , Jacob . The lessons we 've learned are n't lost . You see , I cry now because I 'm only a woman . I 'm tired . . . that 's all . The Rochdale weavers , poor as they were in the last century , poor as the Apostles , made the Rochdale experiment work a hundred years ago . In the end , we will win  --  our.side , I mean . This is one small fray in a long war . " The siren , rising from a subterranean vault in the center of the earth , now soared upward in a grooved iron ascent , reached the last note audible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piercing splendor rent the gathering night . The echo from Shawnee Mountain rose to mid-scale and was joined by the echo from the North Mountain range . Answer . Answer . Faint . Fainter . Gone . They surged to their feet . " Over , " she whispered . She picked up her coat , saying , " I 'll go now . I have my own torch . " She went through the woods . She paused at the New-Boundary gate . For a moment there her shoulders shrank into a symbol of defeat . The wind blew the beige dress against her  --  as years before it had whipped the calico gown of her grandmother when she stood nearer the crest of the ridge and reminded Mark Stone of a figurehead of a ship . Sally raised her hand toward the Coldspring in farewell . Then her fingers curled , leaving her forefingers extended toward the mine in a gesture often used to prevent a dog from following . For the passing of the queen of the anthracite , the first great shaft mine , most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the store in Coldspring Village . They were waiting till the pumps died  --  counting the seconds of the systole , the pause , the dyastole of the heart of their mine . The pumps started to slow . They could not believe it . The habit of years and decades told them it could not be . Silence , like blackdamp , settled inexorably . The pump had beaten in obedience to their own will . It was stopping in the next few seconds because they had said , " Stop . " Sobs blocked their stringy throats . Adam 's apples caught in clay-like necks . Some had worked forty years in the Coldspring , going in when they were nine or ten ? and their fathers before them . The men bared their heads . The pumps were exhaling . The pause . They counted . Eight seconds . The breath paused in mid-flight , taking off into the night . Silence . Tears streamed . " I got a new piece for a new time , " Tomato-Face said . " Here a little , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's over . One hundred and ten of us died in the Avondale disaster ; Queen Victoria of England sent money to the widows in the valley . The great days are over . The Mollys are long gone , their own wrongs with them . The Irish were abused by the bosses , but also by  |p489  their English and Scotch buddies alongside of them too . Now there 's no more Scotch , Irish , English , Polack , Slav . . . but just members of District One or Seven or Nine . " Fifty thousand mules come up to the light of day in the strike of 1925 . Most of the mules are gone now too . Machines have taken their places . Our friends the rats , so thoughtful in warning us of a fall of rock , are gone , with no more mule-feed to steal below ground . The rats left us it seems a lifetime back . We made records at the Coldspring for a new world . They are in print here and elsewhere . We done something that wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A deep sigh came from the crowd . They had begun to breathe once more . " When the best we could do at the time is torn down , it makes room for something better . God has needed brave men in his clearing work and the same brave men when the buildings according to some better plan are bein ' built . It 's not the easiest times that make the best men , and always there 's a way for brave men with God 's help , when blackdamp has guttered the lights . " Our anthracite districts are in for a hard time , but the United Mine Workers of America were never stronger in membership or spirit than this night . " How does any kid grow ? Do you know or the doctor know ? No , sirree . Not a man living can say . You know , when someone dies the spirit rises free from its body , like a mist on the Susquehanna and goes away . How ? Where ? It 's body is lyin ' quiet and cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to toil . It rushes free of earth like the up-draught from the flues . " Sobbing watered the silence . " My new piece is called My Wee Coal Hole . ' Nor did I compose it . It was composed by some other . " He was silent , struggling for his voice : " While the woes of unemployment were increasing , While the price of foodstuffs swelled the grocer 's till , For to fix against next winter 's chill breeze Lest our poor families do freeze , We dug a wee coal hole on God 's hill . ' "  |p490  Men along the fence recaptured power to move , then shifted their weight . A light sound of whispering grew here and there in the crowd . He recited the second stanza . As he began the third , it almost seemed that the freezing night had become less cold . " Yes , " he went on . " " Cause those cops caved in our wee coal hole . " ' To my poverty they added bitter toll ; They threw my only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynamite They put teeth in winter 's bite , When they caved in my wee coal hole . " Here upon old mine hill 's side My folks were born , here toiled , here died ; So my birthright is my wee coal hole . " Shove your selfish coal and iron laws on greed 's shelf ; Most coal lands were stolen by fraud and pelf , And may God blast the breed Whose religion is greed May Satan sear their souls with bootleg coal . " While you 're piling greedy profits on your roll , Vain you try to flag the flow of bootleg coal . When all the collieries ' pulleys turn , When honest miners bread can earn , Then you 'll be free of bootleg coal . " God 's and man 's first law is this : " Protect thyself . " Men ca n't munch from meatless pots and doughless delf . Honest men eat honest bread By their brow 's sweat , Jesus said . So do n't you dynamite my new coal hole . ' " There was another sigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two of the bravest of the crowd even turned and faced the looming shadow of the Coldspring that had brooded over them so many years , the pumps scarcely stilled , only moments divided them from their life that had been .  |p491  It was a regal cadaver , erect in death , with a clear vertical fall of some hundreds of feet , the bastioned angles and queer sides which Mark Stone envisioned and constructed to cover exactly , without a foot too much , the machinery , the rollers , and breakers , the flumes and the screens  --  now all in corrugated metal , no longer of timber . Tomato-Face continued : " No matter how many years ye young fellows far beyond the fence have to live  --  you 'll see the dawn of a new and better day in this great country  --  in the dark watches of the night you 'll hear this last half-breath of the Coldspring Mine . Not till you are old like me , does it come to you . There 's no breath in all the running coals in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the efforts of blood and of sweat are counted like the hairs of our head . We return to glory . . . no despair , no death , no hunger , nor cold . He is our Father in Heaven , our buttee on earth . " We 've lived through great days with the Coldspring . Take this new thought now : it seems we are all tight valuable bundles , sewed like those from old country , that have got into an old trunk that wo n't carry us a mile without breaking to pieces . When the trunk breaks because it 's old , does it affect the value of the United States mails within , on its way ? By no means . " To some of us who stand here this night , came the victory of 1902 , when it seemed with wages , hours and the Union , Heaven on earth had come . Being faulty and prone to err , we did not see a world depression . Now let 's all that can , get in touch through the Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big enough to keep a bed-bug . Be off in the mornin ' on the Johnny Mitchell specials . Do n't be makin ' the good-bys too long . Many of us worked years before we could send for wife and children in the old country , with the wide sea between . If where you get goin ' elsewhere is short of hands , send for the rest of us who 'll be stickin ' by the coal holes and bootleg coal . The flying field being close by , we can join you in a short space of time . " There 's a lot of trouble-makers that never raised a ton of coal out on the roads you 'll travel , that 'll tell you just who you can dynamite to put the world to rights . Do n't listen . Men made the  |p492  world like it is . With what you learned these years underground , and what we learned arunning the Coldspring Mine , it 's us God ca n't spare in Pennsylvania , the second greatest state in this commonwealth of free men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cap . The others bared their heads once more as he faced the mine which had been their life . " Good-by , " he said , " Coldspring . " THE END
