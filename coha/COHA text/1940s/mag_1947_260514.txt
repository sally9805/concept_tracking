For eight months , Mississippi 's gnome-like Theodore Bilbo had been waiting for the day he would descend on Washington and reclaim his seat in the U.S. Senate . Part of the time he spent dawdling around his echoing 27-room Dream House at Poplarville , Miss . Part of his exile was spent in New Orleans " getting my mouth reamed out . " He had cancer of the mouth and he underwent a series of delicate operations. * <P> Despite pain and danger he did not lose the coarse ferocity which had endeared him to voters in Mississippi 's piney woods . He bragged that one operation had left him , with " no more chin than a jack-rabbit " ; he said he had a pistol under his pillow for photographers . He talked nonchalantly of death , promised to " haunt the hell " out of the Republicans who had started the fight to bar him from the Senate . As summer wore on he seemed to be on the road to recovery . But a fortnight ago his wizened , 69-year-old body fell prey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed a blood clot in the lungs . Doctors at New Orleans ' Foundation Hospital discovered that he was partially paralyzed . <P> Newsmen were not allowed to see him at the hospital . But he had previously been seized with an odd impulse to get something off his chest to a Negro editor named Leon Lewis . In June , he had summoned Lewis to his side . The man who had preached race hate with a venom seldom exceeded in U.S. history delivered a reluctant and rambling apology to his dark-skinned visitor : <P> " I am honestly against the social intermingling of Negroes and whites but I hold nothing personal against the Negroes as a race . They should be proud of their God-given heritage just as l am proud of mine . I believe Negroes should have the right to indiscriminate use of the ballot , and in Mississippi too-when their main purpose is not to put me out of office and when they wo n't try to besmirch the reputation of my state . " <P> This , published in Negro South , was his final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the early afternoon , he died . <P> During 40 years in public life Theodore Bilbo had publicly admitted sins which would have shattered a dozen ordinary political careers . He had bragged of being a lecher , and of taking a bribe . He had double-crossed his political allies . When he ended his second term as governor in 1932 , Mississippi had all but sunk into bankruptcy . His cries for " white supremacy " had affronted millions . But few demagogues had capitalized so skillfully on fear , prejudice and the human need for drama . The poor Mississippians whom he called " peckerwoods " elected him again &; again . <P> In death , he received the honors due a man of talent and position . Mississippi sent a detachment of 50 national guardsmen to keep a watch as Bilbo , resplendent in the red tie and diamond stickpin which had been his campaign badge , lay in state at the Dream House . The U.S. Senate will pay for his funeral . Mississippi 's Governor Fielding Wright , Senator James 0 . Eastland , five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juniper Grove Baptist Church ( built with Bilbo 's donations ) to attend the services . Five thousand humbler folk stood outside in the churchyard and listened to the services via loudspeakers.
