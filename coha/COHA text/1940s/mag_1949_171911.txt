The Rev. John Howard Melish , 74 , rector of Brooklyn 's Episcopal Church of the Holy Trinity , got his walking papers last week , but he declined to budge . His bishop fired him , but Rector Melish came right back with the observation that the bishop had no right to do such a thing . He sat pat and so did his son and associate rector , the Rev. William Howard Melish , 38 , who was the cause of it all . Young Minister Melish 's activities as chairman of the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship , and busy associate of several other organizations cited as Communist fronts , had spurred the church 's vestry to petition Long Island 's Bishop James Pernette De Wolfe for his father 's ouster ( TIME , Feb. 7 ) . <P> Doubt &; Confusion . Bishop De Wolfe explained that his decision had been based primarily upon consideration of " the pastoral relationship . " Wrote he : " I believe the Rev. William Howard Melish , assistant minister , to have been . . . most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his ministry . He has allowed himself ... to become involved with ' outside activities ' of such a nature and to such an extent as to incite doubt and confusion in the church as to whether he is indeed living up to his ordination vows as a priest in this church . . . <P> " A priest in his activities necessarily involves his church and his parish . . . Questions have arisen regarding the effect upon the church as a whole , and upon the parish in particular , of the activity on the part of one of the church 's priests in good standing , exercised among reputed atheists , Communists , agitators of world revolution , totalitarianism , and almost every article which denies the Christian Doctrine of Man . " <P> Letter &; Spirit . April 4 was the date named by the bishop for the Melishes ' " pastoral relationship " to " cease . " But father &; son made no move to pack up their vestments . Instead , Rector Melish announced that he denied the legality of the bishop 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the civil courts . Said he : <P> " The bishop has acted in the face of the expressed wish of more than 70% of the qualified voters of my parish and , as I am advised by my counsel , in violation of both the letter and the spirit of Canon law . . . Four bishops have broken all precedents by indicating their willingness to enter the jurisdiction of a brother bishop to testify on my behalf , as have over 30 other outstanding church leaders . <P> " I have repeatedly said that we are both willing to resign if that is the wish of the congregation . I can not withdraw from this fight so long as my congregation wishes me to stay . "
