Besides Making Money . . . <P> Sirs : <P> Letters of servicemen and ex-servicemen , as well as others , to TIME during the last few months inquire rather pathetically why the postwar U.S. ( and the world ) is not the marvelous , really Christian postwar society which editorial writers and politicians promised us during the war . The answer is obvious . . . . Society will improve only when the individuals decide to improve . . . morally and spiritually . . . . We of the postwar era are no more tolerant , unselfish , and no more disciplined in our behavior than pre-1939 and far less so than pre-1900 . . . . <P> Until we see other aims in life besides . . . making money and having a good time , usually at the expense of the other guy , we can be sure that our civilization-what 's left of it-is on the way out . . . . <P> H. C. FRANCIS London , Ont . <P> <P> Trot-Do n't Run <P> Sirs : <P> Senator Taft says that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " nomination for the presidency-TIME , June 10 . . . . Did n't William Tecumseh Sherman say in June , 1884 , " I will not accept if nominated and will not serve if elected " ? <P> GEORGE H. LATHAM Wilmington <P> He did-and was not nominated. - ED . <P> <P> Soap &; Socialism <P> Sirs : <P> ... If Unilever TIME , June 10 can gross $1,200,000,000 in a year , I ca n't for the life of me see why the British Empire needs four billion as a gift from the U.S. Instead of nationalizing a rundown coal mine , let them take over a money-making outfit like that . . . . <P> W. E. YOCUM Washington <P> <P> Black &; White Lowdown <P> Sirs : <P> May I take exception to J. A. Riechman TIME , June 17 . As a " lowdown white woman " married to a Negro-may I say that it is legitimate , I believe , to live with anyone one marries , regardless of race . May I also say that the people of this country are gradually coming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and achievement , which they can help , rather than by their color , which they ca n't help . Also . . . only one-fifth of the 13,000,000-odd " Negroes " in this country are full-blooded Negroes , and I 'm sure the other 10,000,000 colored people are n't all products of white women sleeping with Negro men-not by a long shot ! . . . Down South the policy seems to be " We sleep with them but we can't-or won't-marry them . " Personally , I always thought that anyone a person thought enough of to sleep with was due that person 's supreme respect , love and admiration . . . . <P> <P> ( MRS . ) EDWARD EMANUEL New York City <P> <P> Glass &; Co . <P> Sirs : <P> In TIME , June 10 , you state in your obituary of Carter Glass that he wrote the Federal Reserve Act . <P> This is not so . <P> The Federal Reserve Act was written by my husband , Edmund D. Hulbert . . . . <P> He and President Wilson put it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress . . . . <P> <P> ( MRS . ) EMILY S. HULBERT Chicago <P> Reader Hulbert is partly right . Although Carter Glass is generally credited as the " father " of the Federal Reserve Act , several others-including Banker Hulbert-helped draft it. - ED . <P>
