The U.S. this week faces its bitterest defeat since 1814 : the loss of all the southwest Pacific except Australia . And Australia is in peril . If Java falls , if the United Nations lose their last bases within striking distance of the Japanese , what kind of war can the U.S. then wage in the Pacific ? <P> Hit &; Run . The Navy and its air service can harass Japanese shipping and outposts by surface , submarine and aircraft-carrier raids , constantly striking and then retiring to the main U.S. base in Pearl Harbor . Such raids can not win the war . They can not even protect U.S. shipping routes to the Allied forces in Australia and the Middle East , or supply lines to Russia , India and China . <P> Attack from the North . Tonguing out from Alaska , 1,150 miles into the north Pacific toward Tokyo , lie the U.S. Aleutian Islands ( see map , p. 17 ) . The outermost U.S. base , Dutch Harbor , is 2,550 miles from Tokyo-well beyond effective bomber range . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paramoshiri in the Kuriles , which means that they could be either targets for Japanese attack or U.S. steppingstones toward Japan . Heavily armed , carefully balanced striking forces might take off from Alaska and the Aleutians , perhaps get the use of Russia 's naval base at Petropavlovsk , fight for footholds in the Kuriles , then strike directly at Japan itself . <P> A more immediate possibility for attack in the north is bombing from Vladivostok , only 580 air miles from Tokyo . For that offensive the U.S. must have : 1 ) Russia 's consent ; 2 ) more bombers than have yet been delivered to any front . <P> Attack from the Center . Given the means and the offensive will , the U.S. can do more than raid from Pearl Harbor . Assault forces of carriers , cruisers , destroyers , submarines and transports with supporting troops can strike to recapture Wake , * then Guam , eventually establish a forward base in Japan 's Marianas . Similar forces could fight step by step through Japan 's Marshall and Caroline Islands , finishing what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> With this spearpoint in the Marianas and Guam , U.S. forces would still be 1,350 miles from Tokyo , but they would again be in position to threaten Japan 's vital supply routes . And the Navy would be in a better position to aim striking forces at Japan . <P> But for all-out attack via the Aleutians and the Marianas , the U.S. must amass more carriers , more shipping , more aircraft . Then it must fight for the bases . All this means that full-scale attacks from the north and center are possibilities for the future . How far in the future depends mainly on how fast the U.S. musters its offensive will and spirit , gets additional aircraft carriers into service , and reconstructs its naval thinking around the assault airplane . <P> Attack from the South . If Java falls , Australia will thus remain an all-essential base for present operations in the far Pacific . Desolate , vulnerable northern Australia would be hard to defend against determined Japanese attack . But Australia 's Prime Minister John Curtin was speaking for as well as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be held . There the U.S. can amass land and air forces ; there it can base the naval forces necessary for an attempt to recapture the Indies and drive on toward Malaya and Japan from the south . <P>
