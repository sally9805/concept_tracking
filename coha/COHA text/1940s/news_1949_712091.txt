txt The House passed and sent to the Senate today a foreign.aid appropriation of $5,617,470,000 , including $4,642,470,000 for the European Recovery Program . The standing vote on passage was 193 to 27 . The measure was sped through the House with a minimum of debate after leaders on both sides accepted a compromise agreement nominally cutting European Recovery Funds by $629,730,000 under , Administration estimates but per-1 mitting expenditure of the appropriation in thirteen-and-a-half months instead of fifteen . After leaving the way open for a supplemental appropriation restoring this cut before the end gf the 1949-50 fiscal year , the House heeded a special appeal from President Truman and restored half of the $150,000,000 reduction by the appropriations committee in funds for government and relief in occupied areas . This action left the so-called " Garioa " fund at $925 , - 000,000 for fiscal 1950 . " Adequate Funds " Asked In a letter to Representative Clarence Cannon , *chairman of the appropriations committee , President Truman expressed confidence that Congress would provide " adequate funds " for the Economic Cooperation Administration because the importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , that the reduction in funds for occupied areas would make it impossible for the people in such areas , including Japan and Korea , to become self-supporting . ? On a standing division the House voted , 120 to 39 , to restore half the amount cut by the Appropriations Committee in funds for occupied areas , which then was left at $75,000,000 less than the Administration 's request .. By a separate voice vote , the majority then virtually restored the amount requested for administrative expenses within the $925 , - // $5,617,470,000 AID PASSED BY HOUSE // 000,000 fund for occupied areas . President Truman had asked $50 , - 000,000 for these expenses . As voted by the House the sum was left at $45,000,000 . In a revised ECA appropriation request intended to reflect commodity price declines since submission of the original estimate , President Truman asked Congress for $5,272,200,000 for European recovery operations in the fifteen months ending June 30 , 1950 . This included $1,074,000,000 for the final three months of the current fiscal year . Committee Cut Fund The Appropriations Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve months of the new fiscal year by $629,730 , - 000 . It was then that leaders agreed the reduced amount should be appropriated for the shorter period . The otherwise perfunctory debate leading up to final passage was enlivened briefly during the afternoon when Representative Boyd Hackett , Democrat , of Arkansas , offered an amendment to strike out an item of $25,000 for " entertainment " incident to administration of the , program . To the great amusement of the public galleries and Paul G. Hoffman , ECA administrator , who sat watching the proceedings , Mr. Hackett argued that it should not be necessary to entertain European representatives to get them in the mood to accept a $4,600 , - 000,000 gift from the American people . The proposal was shouted down after Representative J. Vaughan Gary , Democrat , of Virginia , reminded members that much important business usually was discussed over luncheons that the representatives of this or any other government should not be required to pay for out of their own pockets . As chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee originating the measure and manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House in opening debate that through the Marshall Plan , " communism has been checked in its steps " throughout Europe . He added that , up to this point , " the cold war in Germany has been won . " So successful has been the program , Mr. Gary explained , that those who opposed its commencement a year ago as a waste of money were now arguing that " recovery has been so substantial that we do not need additional funds . " Cannon , which was read to the House by Representative Gary : You are , of course , aware of my deep interest in the success of the work of the Economic Cooperation Administration and the success of our program for government and relief in occupied areas . I am firmly convinced that the maintenance of these operations on an adequate basis is not only necessary for the fulfillment of our international obligations and the success of our foreign policy , but also that the operation of this program on an adequate basis at this time will , in the long run , prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The importance of the Economic Cooperation Administration is so well understood that I am confident that we can expect the Congress to continue to provide adequate funds for its work . I would- like to stress the importance of providing equally adequate funds for government and relief in occupied areas . The funds which would be provided for this purpose in the appropriation bill reported by the committee would be adequate to continue the maintenance of the minimum ration per individual but , for all practical purposes , would not permit the continuance of the program for economic rehabilitation in Japan and in the Ryukyus . " The reduced funds would also seriously affect the program for economic rehabilitation in Germany , which is carried on in conjunction with the work of the Economic Cooperation Administration . Only , by continuance of this program could we expect the people in these areas eventually to become self-supporting . I feel that provision of an amount adequate to carry on the program of government aid and relief in occupied areas at the level requested will , in the long run , reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnestly hope , therefore , that this amount will be made available .
