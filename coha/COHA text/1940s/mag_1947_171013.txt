When Harry Truman nominated his good friend , California Oilman Ed Pauley , to be Under Secretary of the Navy in January 1946 , he got a rude shock . Senators , noting that the Navy buys great quantities of oil , were leary of Pauley 's behind-the-scenes activities in the great tidelands oil controversy and let it be known that they would refuse to confirm him . After six weeks of stormy hearings , Harry Truman withdrew the nomination . <P> Last week Ed Pauley , who had done a workmanlike job for the President as his special ambassador on reparations , came back to Washington . Harry Truman had appointed him as a special temporary assistant to Secretary of the Army Kenneth Royall . His duties would be to assist in industrial procurement ; the War Department said that the job-which does not require Senate confirmation-would take about three months . <P> But Washington heard rumors that Harry Truman might be grooming Ed Pauley to take the place of Secretary Royall , who wants to run for Governor of North Carolina .
