txt There is an atmosphere on the Dewey campaign train entirely different from that of 1944 . This time there is a confidence , a poise , and a degree of easy amiability , even among the top command , which were not much in evidence four years ago . There are plenty of reasons . One is that Governor Dewey has some experience behind him he did n't have before . This is his second try . Another is that at last the Republican nominee can see the White House within reach . Many would say almost within arm 's reach . The most important reason of all is the way Mr. Dewey has decided to conduct his campaign . This difference in the Governor 's approach already is evident only one day out of Albany on the wideranging , fast - moving tour ? which is taking him 8,000 miles in 15 days into 13 states to deliver 51 speeches . * It adds up to this , and it can be said with knowledge that it is the guiding and agreed concept which has influenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aides have adopted : Mr. Dewey intends to take the role of champion , not that of challenger , throughout the . entire campaign . He will not get into a " slug- , ging match " with President Truman . He has put aside entirely the mood of what is conventionally called " the fighting candidate "  --  a state of mind which got him into so much hot water in 1944 . When the President hurls the whole dictionary plus the inkwell into the political winds , as he did at Dexter , Iowa , with such provocative epithets as " Republican gluttons of privilege " who have " stuck a pitchfork into the farmer 's back , " the Goyernor is determined not to Meld to the temptation to replyin kind . Mr. Dewey has mapped out what he considers a constructive , positive , high-level campaign , and he aims to stick to it . He plans to declare himself concretely on a wide range of issues over the next few weeks . He is n't going to spend much time talking back at Mr. Truman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and say what he believes should be done . He plans to rest his case on his own exposition of the issues without dropping or being pushed into a name-calling , querulous debate . A. The political circumstances of 1948 make it easier for Mr. Dewey to pitch his campaign on this note . He begins in the lead . His prospects of winning are high , for Mr. Truman manifestly is not the formidable candidate ' that Franklin D. Roosevelt was . The GOP is more united than it was four years ago , and Governor Dewey is stronger within the party and more decisively in command . These circumstances almost create for the Republican nominee a role of champion rather than challenger . Mr. Dewey does n't count , himself to be on the defensive and aims not to let himself be maneuvered into that position . Berblock. 1 ) Washington Post ' You Hear Motors or Anything ? ' As Mr. Dewey 's strategists see it , four years ago , President Roosevelt sat back during the early weeks of the campaign and let the big-name figures in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annoying the Republican candidate and ultimately " softening him up . " at which time Mr. Roosevelt came in to deliver a few well-timed blows of his own . These ' conditions now appear in reverse . There are few , indeed , in the President 's Cabinet who can command national attention on the stump for Mr. Truman . Such administration stalwarts as Secretary of State Marshall and Secretary of Defense Forrestal are on the bipartisan sidelines . In the main , Mr. Truman has to go it alone , with an occasional assist from Senator Barkley . Now it is Mr. Dewey who has a galaxy of political orators at his command . And he intends to use them . It is n't that the Governor intends to let th. : President 's arguments and epithets go unanswered . He simply is going to let his prominent Republican colleagues do most of the answering . Governor Warren will speak out when necessary . So will Messrs . Stassen , Vandenberg , Taft , Lodge , Know-land , Saltonstall , Baldwin , Martin , and others . And what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy , about 8,000 miles in 15 days , 51 speeches in 13 states . And that 's only the first trip , only the beginning . Although this year he is devoting 18 fewer days to barnstorming , he will cover more territory and make at least twice as many appearances as in 1944 . But through it all . Governor Dewey aims to talk " more like a President than a politician " in the conviction that this is the best politics .
