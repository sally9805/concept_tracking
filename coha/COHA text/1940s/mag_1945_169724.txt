The raids went off without a hitch . Outside the city MPs quietly nabbed three of the four G.I.s suspected of organizing Tokyo 's huge black-market traffic . Armed with submachine guns , more than 35 MPs surrounded Tokyo 's fashionable Marunouchi Hotel , which the gang used as headquarters . The MPs manned the switchboards , took over the elevators , promptly caught the fourth . <P> Other quarry in the raid last week were two employes of the Italian consulate who had served as middlemen in the racket .

After ten days of such secretive investigation , the C.I.D . had enough evidence to crack down . <P> The four G.I.s had done nearly $1 million worth of business in sugar , tinned milk , shoes and underwear in the previous two weeks , planned to break up next day after splitting a final take of $465,000 . <P> Private Frank S.

He and his chief sidekick , Private Robert E. Tucker , admitted to having learned the ins &; outs of the supply racket in the scandalous G.I. black-market operations in France . <P> But the C.I.D . had also learned its role in such earlier operations . In the European and Mediterranean theaters , in China , Burma , and India , it has convicted several hundred G.I. blackmarketeers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigations will make a different story .
