Most of the leaders of the new 81st Congress would be familiar . They were men who had grown old in the service of Franklin D. Roosevelt 's New Deal . After only two years in minority exile , they were back in the seats of power . <P> , Senate whip and Barkley 's understudy . Barkley , himself , was expected to step down frequently from the presiding officer 's dais to exert his considerable talent for cloakroom leadership . Texas ' Tom Connally , 71 , who has lost some of his shaggy hair because of shingles , will take back the big job of chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , where he has labored in comparative obscurity for the last two years under the shadow of Michigan 's Arthur Vandenberg . <P> Ailing &; Acidulous . Utah 's Elbert D. Thomas , 65 , who votes as labor thinks , would replace Ohio 's Robert A. Taft as chairman of the Senate Labor &; Public Welfare Committee . New York 's ailing Robert F. Wagner , 71 , has the seniority for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well enough to take it . If not , the next in line is South Carolina 's nails-hard , conservative Burnet Maybank , 49 . Tennessee 's querulous , old ( 79 ) Kenneth McKellar was on deck for the Appropriations Committee , Maryland 's acidulous Millard E. Tydings for Armed Services , Georgia 's Walter F. George for Finance . <P> In the House , shrewd and peppery Sam Rayburn , 66 , of Texas , will replace Joe Martin as Speaker . New York 's durable Sol Bloom , 78 , will take over the Foreign Affairs Committee from New Jersey 's Charles A. Eaton . New York 's tight-fisted John Taber will relinquish the Appropriations Committee purse strings to Missouri 's Clarence Cannon , 69 , who looks like a professional mourner and is always willing to give a sympathetic ear to an Administration request . <P> Ranting &; Liberal . The powerful Rules Committee , will fall to Illinois ' 82-year-old Adolph J. Sabath , the Ways &; Means Committee to North Carolina 's Robert L. ( " Muley " ) Doughton , who last week celebrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Fred Hartley as chairman of the Labor Committee will be Michigan 's liberal John Lesinski . Chairmanship of the Un-American Activities Committee will return to Georgia 's John S. Wood , who , following past form , will probably let Mississippi 's ranting John Rankin run the show . <P> If Massachusetts ' John W. MacCormack becomes House majority leader , as expected , he will probably abandon his claim on the Committee on Expenditures in Executive Departments . Next in line is Chicago 's William L. Dawson , one of two Negroes in Congress ( the other : New York 's Adam Clayton Powell Jr . ) . Born in Georgia , Dawson is big , dark-skinned , a lawyer , a powerful speaker . He would be the first Negro to serve as a committee chairman in modern congressional history .
