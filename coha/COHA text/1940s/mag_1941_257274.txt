Joseph Clark Baldwin , 44 , is a shrewd New York politician who looks like a man-about-town-a very leisurely , prosperous sort of town . Looking at his slick , prematurely grey hair , his invariably dapper dress , or the dapper water colors he paints for relaxation , nobody would think he had ever been an alderman . Still less does he seem a hard-bitten politico with a good liberal record who has beaten Tammany in seven out of eight elections . Oldest of nine children , son of a wealthy New Yorker , he was in the Navy in World War I for six seasick months , transferred to the Army , fought in France , met the French girl he afterwards married , got back to Harvard ( and Porcellian and Hasty Pudding ) to graduate just before the family fortunes collapsed . He had a brief spell of newspaper work , and then Joseph Baldwin was in politics up to the neck that his enemies said was stiffer than it need be . <P> On the death last month of Representative Kenneth Simpson ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans picked Joseph Baldwin to run in a special election . Democrats picked liberal Lawyer Dean Alfange . The left wing of the American Labor Party picked Communistic Eugene Connolly , who was handicapped by his following of the corkscrewy party line . <P> James Farley rushed in to speak for Alfange . President Roosevelt sent him a message of support . Wendell Willkie speaking in a measured voice that made listeners believe he was at last taking speaking lessons , stumped for Joe Baldwin . So did Tom Dewey and Fiorello LaGuardia . The election was a significant test of issues and men that reached far beyond Manhattan . For Republicans it was a test of Willkie 's foreign policy , of his ability as a vote-getter for somebody else . For Democrats it was a test of whether or not voters would continue giving unqualified support to New Deal policies . For isolationists , it was a count of the number of strange bedfellows brought together despite violent domestic disagreements . <P> Last week the votes were in : Baldwin , 23,252 ; Alfange , 16,690 ; Connolly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this outcome was Wendell Willkie . He was doubly pleased because the trend he had foreseen for the Republican Party seemed confirmed . Joseph Baldwin had won by a bigger percentage than had popular Kenneth Simpson . Isolationists in the Republican Party , who had proclaimed that Willkie 's program would bring disaster , had been confounded . Moreover , isolationist strength among Republicans was ebbing . Many a Republican Senator who had been reported ready to fight Willkie for his support for Lend-Lease voted for Lend-Lease in the end-and they were party men as influential as Oldtimer Charles McNary , or as promising as Ohio 's new Senator Harold Burton . Wendell Willkie had done what enemies had said he could not do-buckle down to the hard drudgery of machine politics to help elect Republicans who stood for the things he believed in . From being on the edge of repudiation by the party two months ago , Wendell Willkie last week was in a stronger position than he had been in since the early days of the 1940 campaign . <P> But he still gave no indication of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week overflowed into eight rooms , employed a paid and volunteer staff of 15 . Letters received since election day : 250,000 ; invitations to speak : 75 a day .
