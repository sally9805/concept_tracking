We 're in the Money LAST summer I achieved the almost mythical goal of every owner of an amateur sixteen- 4 millimeter motion-picture camera . I produced a film that was actually purchased by one of the big motion-picture companies to be blown up to thirty-five millimeters and released for national distribution to the regular motion-picture houses . Today , all my old camera-minded friends , with whom I spent many happy years tangled up in homemade dollies and falling over Junior Type flood lamps , look on me with awe . " We 've heard about a fellow who made a simple little short on his pet dog and sold it to MGM for twenty-five thousand dollars , " they say in respectful tones . " But , of course , we understand that he is n't in your class . " Well , you 're right , pals . He certainly was n't . It all started two years ago , when I sold an article to The Saturday Evening Post on hunting the big mountain lizards of Southern Mexico with an eagle trained for falconry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. MANNIX on our honeymoon and , with a forbearance that would have interested Job , she allowed me to bring along a newly trapped American bald eagle , whom we christened Aquila , the Mexican word for " eagle . " Frankly , there were moments when we regretted including Aguila as one of the party , such as the night we left her in the bathroom and discovered the next morning that she had eaten a six months ' supply of toothpaste . But when she became trained , we spent many happy hours riding over the mountains with her , making things hot for the local lizard population . Shortly after the Post article appeared , I received a number of letters from Hollywood . Most of them wanted to know if my eagle would fly off with a baby , as a publicity stunt . I could only tell them that , in the first place , no eagle can lift more than six or seven pounds and , in the second place , the baby used would be considerably the worse for wear . One producer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a short he was making . " Now , let 's see , " he began . " How many eagles do you have ? " " Why , one ! " I answered , considerably astonished . " Oh , I thought you had three or four hundred , " said the producer , considerably disappointed . " There 's no story in just one . " But one day my literary agent called me up to say he had received a letter from an independent producer in Hollywood who was interested in making a three-reel featurette of the eagles and the lizards , to be photographed in Mexico . When we told our friends the good news , they were almost frantic with their congratulations . " Why , now you 're really in the money , " they assured us . " Those motion-picture companies do n't care what they pay . But be careful they do n't trap you into signing something for four or five thousand dollars . Hold out for a decent sum . " Well , we were perfectly willing to be trapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My wife and I went into a huddle and decided that to refuse this chance would be kicking opportunity in the teeth . So we instructed our agent to tell the producer that we were open to being trapped . We were living in New York and the producer flew East to see us . Apparently , producers always fly in those rare moments when they are n't using the long-distance telephone . The next day , surrounded by a barrage of lawyers , we signed the contract . The producer flew back to the Coast to arrange last-minute details , while my wife and I sublet our apartment , bought another eagle from a trapper in Colorado to act as a stand-in for Aguila , and prepared to leave for Mexico . Unfortunately , the check for our traveling expenses which our producer was to have sent us did not materialize . With both eagles , we were forced to stay with my wife 's long-suffering family . We 6 thought it would only be a few days , but when three weeks dragged by and there was still no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But we could not complain that our producer was ignoring us . Almost daily we received long letters from him , making new suggestions about the picture , enclosing clippings of his previous successes , enclosing notes he had received from various distributors  --  in fact , enclosing practically everything encouraging under the sun except a check . During this period , Dr. Alexander Leighton and his doctor wife , Dorothea Leighton , came to visit us for a week end . Alex and I have known each other for years and are both very much interested in amateur sixteen-millimeter documentaries . While Alex and I were running some of our film through a viewer , his wife and Jule chatted together on the porch . " Did Dan tell you that a producer is going to do a short on our eagles ? " Jule asked . " Oh , have you a producer too ? " exclaimed Dorothea ' with eager , girlish enthusiasm . " We have one , and such a nice one ! He came from Hollywood . But he eats so much ! He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just telling Alex the other day that he 's getting to be a real extravagance . " " Well , ours feeds himself , " said Jule proudly . " Not only that , but he 's bought , us three meals . " It turned out that another independent producer had descended on the Leightons some months before with a plan to do a series of shorts showing common psychological quirks . " It 's a real treat to listen to him speculate on how many hundred thousand we 'll get for the first short , " Alex confided to me afterward . " I work hard all day in the clinic and I need a little relaxation in the evenings . " Well , we never did make that picture . After two months we gave up hope and , since we had already rented a house in Mexico for the summer , we went down and shot several hundred feet of sixteen-millimeter color film of the eagles with my camera . We thought it would be nice to have some pictures of the birds for our personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night that winter we were running off our film in our living room for a group of visitors when one of our guests , who had some slight connection with the commercial films , asked " Why do n't you see if you could n't do a short on those birds ? " My wife and I leaped out of our seats as if stabbed , for the scars of our experience with our producer had not yet healed . But our friend said hastily , " With one of the big companies , I mean . You can trust them . I have some friends at Universal Pictures who might be interested . " We were doubtful , but at last agreed to show our home movies to Universal . Our friend got us an appointment , and with our sixteen-millimeter silent projector , vintage 1934 , and our 400 feet of film , we traveled to the studio on one of the top floors of Radio City . Everyone in the office seemed to he in a hurry . We were rapidly handed on from one stenographer to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a red light burning above it and a sign , STUDIO IN USE . We were in the projection room , watching the end of a newsreel being " put to bed . " Instead of rows of seats , this room had nice , big , fat armchairs . Most of the armchairs were full of gentlemen smoking cigars and watching the film , but we found a couple of seats and settled down . Every now and then boys rushed into the room , pushing little wagons loaded with the enormous thirty-five-millimeter reels . Suddenly the newsreel ended , the sound was cut off and the lights leaped on . One of the men in the front row shouted , " O.K. ! Let 's have the next ! " It turned out that we were next . The projectionist popped out of his booth in the rear and said hurriedly to me , " Come on ; let 's have your film . " I reached into my pocket and pulled out my little sixteen-millimeter reel . " That ! " shouted the projectionist with scorn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " We 've got our own projector , " I told him . We set up our own projector while the outraged projectionist walked about , saying in a loud voice , " I got nothing to do with this , gentlemen ! This was sprung on me ! It 's amatoor film , that 's what it is , amatoor ! " Finally we were ready and I ran off my reel . There was no comment except the cry of " Next ! " and we left while a cartoon leaped from the indignant projection booth . Jule and I returned home feeling the incident was closed . Two days later our agent telephoned us . " Do you want to go to Mexico with the eagles and a Technicolor crew and make a picture to be called Eagle versus Dragon ? " he asked . Jule , who was sitting near the telephone doing her hair and could hear his voice , nearly swallowed a couple of bobby pins . " We can leave tomorrow , " I told him . f Actually , we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were made with the Mexican government to permit the taking of a motion picture on Mexican soil , and a camera crew was being assembled . We wanted at least a month in Mexico before the crew arrived , to get the eagles acclimated and in flying condition . So , before the last details were arranged , we drove down to Taxeo , the little mountain village in Southern Mexico where we had worked before , with both eagles sitting on a perch in the rear of our station wagon . Hollywood Guinea Pigs Like any athlete , eagles get out of condition , and our birds had had a long winter layoff . But after a few weeks the birds began to get their wings under them again and learned how to ride the tricky thermal drafts of the mountains as easily as the wild hawks that lived in the ledges of the cliffs . We decided that they were ready , and wrote to New York to send the camera crew down . In answer came a letter saying that the company had decided that sending a camera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had decided instead to shoot the whole picture in sixteen-millimeter color and then enlarge , or " blow it up , " to thirty-five-millimeter standard film . This was almost the first time in the history of motion pictures that such an experiment had been tried . For a long time photographic experts had known that it was theoretically possible to enlarge sixteen-millimeter color film , because it has no grain , unlike sixteen-millimeter black and white . But it had never been attempted except for a few " short " subjects , because traditionally sixteen-millimeter was " amateur " film and thirty-five-millimeter " professional . " Our company was finally making the experiment because they had already sunk so much money into our project that they did not want to abandon it , and yet could not stand the terrific cost of a Technicolor camera crew . If the experiment was successful , it would make a great difference to the film industry as a whole . It would mean that one man with an ordinary sixteen-millimeter motion-picture camera could take pictures that before had required an entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth of apparatus . On the other hand , there was the chance that the film would not enlarge perfectly , that it might be scratched , that it might shimmer when thrown on the screen of a big theater . All these chances the company was forced to take . So , instead of the camera staff we had expected , only two men came  --  a director and a cameraman with a sixteen-millimeter camera like mine . The cameraman , Mr. John Green , had lived in Mexico for years and knew the country well . On the other hand , our director , Mr. Paul Thomas , who brought his charming young wife with him , had never been south of El Paso . Neither had ever seen an eagle before . As soon as they arrived , Paul confidently expressed the opinion that we could shoot the picture in three days . Jule and I looked at each other doubtfully . " Oh , you do n't know how we professionals do things in Hollywood , " said Paul , catching the look . " We work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bang , bang , we shoot one scene after another . " Unfortunately for our director 's plan , it turned out that the eagles did n't want the iguanas ; all they wanted was John Green , the cameraman . John used to sit in our patio during the evening and play the flute . For some reason , this innocent recreation infuriated the eagles . They screamed with rage every time he started to play , and finally they began screaming as soon as he appeared . The first day we turned them loose on the hills , preparatory to getting some pictures of them wheeling and circling in the clear blue sky , they both promptly went for John , with the attitude of one who has suffered much , but is now preparing to pay off old scores . This was something definitely not in the script . Astonished , John dodged hack and forth underneath the legs of his tripod while the eagles snatched at whatever part of him was up at the moment . Finally we dragged them off , took them to a nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them off . Did those birds show the slightest interest in that iguana ? They did not . Flying right over the head of the surprised lizard , they went straight for John . But this time he was ready . Grabbing up his camera by the tripod legs , he used it as a club to beat off the eagles , while the two great birds circled around his head , screaming and diving . At last , through the combined efforts of the entire company , the eagles were distracted long enough for John to dive into the mouth of a cave near by . The golden eagle , who was busily trying to eat the three-inch lens off the camera turret head , was restrained , and we all prepared to shoot again . " This is the kind of thing which delays production ! " said Paul severely . He would have been wiser not to have called attention to himself . Aguila , who was dancing around the mouth of the cave , daring John to come out and fight like a man , heard him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the indignant director . Feathered Feud I will say that Paul acted with considerable presence of mind . My camera was set up beside him . , He stepped behind it , focused on Aguila , and pressed the button . Just before the eagle reached him , he locked the button in place , dodged under the tripod and ran for his life . Aguila grabbed the camera , and camera and bird came to the ground together , the camera still busily humming away . That ended the first day 's shooting . For a while it looked as though John would have to operate from within a steel cage or wearing a coat of chain mail . But in the next few days John learned quite a few tricks to avoid Aguila . Of course , on the other hand , Aguila learned several ways of getting hold of John unexpectedly . For example , after John had reloaded his magazine with fresh film , he would have to remove the lens and peer through the empty lens hole while he ran off the first few feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the film leader had been run through . He had to bend over and concentrate on the lens socket while doing this , and that made him a sucker for a quick left to the seat of the pants , as Aguila soon found out . On the other hand , John discovered that he could work quite close to the eagle if Aguila 's attention was only directed elsewhere . There were , however , exceptions to this rule . One day we posed Aguila on a little knoll on top of a hill with a vista of cloud-filled valleys and snow-sugared peaks in the background . John was using a wide-angle lens , which gives somewhat the effect of looking through the wrong end of a telescope  --  distances are increased and partly distorted . John was focusing on Aguila through the reflex finder of the camera  --  a tiny ground-glass mirror that gave a minute but clear image . John was operating the diaphragm opening and the footage scale simultaneously , and he did not realize that Aguila had left her little knoll and was quietly tiptoeing toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get this darned bird in focus , " John complained , still looking through the finder . " Every time I get her sharp , she seems to blur again . " Aguila was now only a few feet away from John and coming on fast with a gleam in her eye . MeeOinued Irem Pee . 36 ) " Dan , hold a film carton beside her , so I can focus on the print ! " John called . " That bird 's jumping around so I ca n't do anything with her ! " Suddenly , John stiffened . We could see him focus desperately for a moment and then look up . He looked right into Aguila 's face , for the eagle had almost reached him . John had gotten very brisk at diving into his cave , but this time he really outdid himself . Even so , Aguila nearly got him just as he vanished . After that , John had one of us measure distances with a tape measure when he wanted very accurate focusing . That evening John and Paul discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it dragged toward the middle of the second reel . " I 've got it ! " exclaimed John , probably inspired by memories of my eagles chasing him . " We 'll have a sequence in which Dan sees the golden eagle sitting on top of an almost perpendicular cliff . It looks like sure death to try to reach the bird , but Dan starts up the side of the precipice . Halfway up , his hand slips and he falls . He lands on a narrow ledge , bounces off , and just when the audience thinks he 's certain to plunge down a hundred feet onto the rocks below , he manages to land in a rock crevice . " The Plot Thickens " Great ! " applauded Paul . " Then we cut to a reverse angle where he 's lying on the ground covered with blood . He crawls to his knees , ties a tourniquet around his arm to stop the severed artery , and starts up the cliff a second time . We move off to a long shot , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pal ! " I interjected , but they were too excited to hear me . " Then , on the edge of the cliff , he grapples with the eagle ! " went on Paul eagerly . . . . " Can you get that golden eagle to claw you , Dan ? " " Easily , " I assured him . She is n't tame yet . Golden eagles are strong enough to kill wolves , and this one has already torn up our dog and ripped Jule 's suede jacket oil her shoulders . " " A quick wipe , then , to a medium shot of the eagle beating up Dan on the brink of the precipice , " continued Paul . " Dan overcomes the eagle  --  if the eagle wins , we can cheat in the other shot later  --  and puts her in a sack . That picks up the whole action and kills a dead spot . " " And that 's not all that 'll get killed , " I pointed out . " I do n't want to spoil you boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eagles , not to commit suicide in a reverse angle shot . " " Oh , that 's all right , " they both assured me . " We 're going to fake it . You wo n't be in any danger at all . " However , when we went out on location again the next day I found that their definition of faking was very different from mine . It was true that the extreme close-up of my hand slipping off the rock could be done with my feet resting firmly on the ground . But the picture of my falling off a cliff could be done only by having me fall off a cliff . Taxco is built on the side of a mountain and the country around it resembles the Swiss Alps , so there were lots of cliffs to choose from . Paul and John finally selected something that looked like the Matterhorn and set up the camera comfortably at the base . " Now you climb up the side of the cliff there , " explained Paul cheerfully , " and we 'll take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how high it is . Then , with the four-inch lens , we 'll come in with a close-up . We 'll put the golden eagle on the top and have Jule hold her there . " Jule instantly suggested that it might be a good idea if Paul held the golden eagle at the top of the cliff himself , and then he 'd be able to place her just where he wanted her . I was equally insistent that John put on my clothes and climb up the side of the cliff , instead of me , so he 'd be sure of going up in exactly the right place for the camera . I offered to work the camera , and Jule was more than willing to direct the scene . We were always eager to co-operate in any way with our camera crew , and never more so than on that particular day . But John and Paul both said no . They said they appreciated our thoughtfulness , but thought it would be much better if they stayed at the bottom and watched . So Jule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eagle and I started up the face . When I got up about twenty-five feet I happened to look down , and saw right away what I 'd suspected all along  --  that this idea of Paul 's was all wet . It is amazing how much higher twenty-five feet is looking down than looking up . I began to think of all the useful , valuable things I could do in this world besides falling off the side of a precipice . I was sorry now that I 'd ever been so active in hauling the eagles off John . I began to realize how often right the instincts of our dumb friends really are . I was full of these philosophical thoughts when I heard a sort of strangled cry from the top of the cliff where Jule was holding the golden eagle . " Danny ! " she screamed . " Hurry ' . " Now , I knew the strength of the golden eagle . Jule and I had spent a month trying to get a glove that her terrible talons could n't go through . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin kid . I pictured Jule pinned down by the eagle 's talons and suffering as much as though she had been bayoneted . I forgot all about Paul and John and the picture , and started ua the cliff as fast as I could go . The rock was rotten shale and kept splintering and cracking off . I came to a place where I could go no farther . I was spread out on the side of the cliff like a fox skin nailed to a barn door , and afraid to let go with either hand . Then I saw a little knob of stone just above me . I let go and grabbed for it . For a second the knuckle of stone held , and then , as I put my full weight on it , it began to peel out of the rock like a kernel of corn out of the cob . Following the Script I knew I was going to fall , but I could n't save myself . The bit of stone peeled slowly away , , and then suddenly the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had that awful sick sensation you have when an elevator drops too fast . I hit a ledge and bounced off , unwillingly following the script to the letter . Then I was lying half stunned at the bottom of the cliff , with a cloud of dust raised by my fall slowly settling around me . I got slowly to my feet . I hurt all over , but nothing seemed to be broken . A hundred yards away , Paul made a megaphone out of his hands and shouted , " Sorry , but you fell right out of the frame ! I could n't pan the camera fast enough to follow you ! Try it once again from the same spot ! " I staggered back far enough so I could see the top of the cliff . " Jule ! " I shouted . " Are you all right ? " A muffled voice answered me , " No , something terrible has happened ! This 40 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST January 16,1943 darned bird is pulling all the hobby pins out of my hair with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left ! " After this I was , not unnaturally , more reluctant than ever to do any rock climbing . But the next morning Paul came to breakfast with a bright smile and the announcement that he 'd found just the place . There 's a long thin spire of rock on the side of a mountain near here , " he explained . " It 's not more than fifty feet high , but we can take it from such an angle that you can see the valley beneath , and it looks as though it were the top of the world . It 's easy to climb too . I climbed it myself yesterday . " An hour later we all assembled at the foot of the spirelike rock . John instantly sat down in its shade and fell into a doze . He had been up late the night before and had n't quite recovered as yet . I walked around the rock and examined its face carefully . It was certainly climbable . A professional athlete or a chimpanzee in good training would have had very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul , " I said at last , " I 'll bet you ten dollars you did n't climb this rock yesterday . " Paul hesitated a bit and finally admitted , " Well , actually I just stood at the bottom and looked up , but I could climb it if I wanted to . " " Well , I 'll bet the same ten dollars that neither you nor anyone else here is going to climb it today , " I said bitterly . But I had reckoned without John . John had lived in Mexico long enough so that he thought in terms of pesos , not in dollars . He awoke with a start . " Ten dollars ! " he shouted . " Why , that 's fifty pesos ! Where is this rock ? Let me at it ! " Before any of us could stop him , he had rushed at the rock , and still half asleep , but using his initial momentum to help him , he went up the side of the monster like a monkey . At the top he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startled , upturned faces . His eyes widened , he gave a low moan and , sinking to the rock , grabbed it with both hands . " For heaven 's sake , where am I ? " he shouted . " Get me down out of here ! " International Incident I had also begun to think in terms of pesos , and it was a small consolatisn to me that it took an hour and a half and the aid of a near-by Indian village to get John off the rock again . Worse yet , I was shamed into climbing the rock myself the next day . Halfway through the rock-climbing sequence , we got a spell of cloudy days . With a special filter it was possible to take good pictures even on such days , but these shots would show the sky a different color from the pictures taken on clear days . At last we decided to do the whole sequence over , using the filter all the time . We had just started on this plan when it became brilliantly sunny again . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called into Mexico City by the censor 's office . All work had to stop until he returned two days later . " We started making arrangements with the censor bureau last December , " he said wearily when he got back . " Now it 's April and I certainly thought everything would be straightened out . But it seems they 've got hold of your Post article and they 're objecting , to it . " " Why ? " I asked in astonishment . " Did n't you mention something about a friend of yours who had the tires stolen off his car while in Mex-ico ? " I remembered that I had . But today , with the priorities on rubber in the States , and Mexico with no restrictions on buying tires , the situation was reversed . A Mexican friend of mine who crossed the border into Texas on some business left his car for a few minutes , and , when he returned , all the tires , including the spare , were gone . As he could not buy any tires in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the border . The last I saw of him , he was gloomily telling everyone what a nation of thieves the gringos were . " So they objected to that , did they ? " I asked . " No , not to that , " said Paul sadly . " When I went into the censor 's office , a very indignant clerk showed me the Post article . " I began to apologize , but he interrupted me . ' Look ! ' he shouted , It says here the thieves lifted up the car with wooden blocks when they stole the tires . Do n't you think our tire thieves use jacks just like yours do ? ' Naturally , I said I was very sorry , and the next time you wrote about anyone stealing tires , you would mention the fact that they used jacks . " We hoped the incident was closed , but three days later I was called into Mexico City to see the censors personally . To give me added moral support , all the rest of our crew went with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and , after a short wait , were ushered into the presence of the censor . The censor 's assistant was there to act as translator . He lost no time . " In your article in The Saturday Evening Post you told a lot of lies about Mexico , " he began , addressing me . " You said a friend of yours had some tires stolen off his car . This was a lie . In Mexico no one ever steals anything . " I simply bowed . Paul said hurriedly , " But my friend is so sorry for his mistake . He sees now how wrong he was . He loves Mexico and this is the third year he has come back here . He wants to buy a house in Taxco . " " So ? " said the censor 's assistant rather grimly . " Then he had better write only of the nice things in this country . There are bad things in all countries , so why mention them ? " A Beau-Brummel Indian That concluded the interview . We shook hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a bar for a good drink . Curiously enough , before the day was out we had a very startling example of Mexican honesty . We had a great many purchases to make in Mexico City before returning to Taxco , and Jule was forced to carry $400 in pesos around with her . During the rush and excitement of getting from one store to another before closing time , she dropped the roll of bills in a taxi . The taxi was a cruising one that we had hailed on the street , belonging to no company , and we had no record of the number or the driver 's name . We gave up the money for lost , but the next morning , as we were leaving the hotel , the driver rushed up to us with the missing roll of bills . He had been waiting for us all morning , but , because he was shabbily dressed , the hotel clerk would n't let him come in . So he had waited for us outside with what , to bim , was a small fortune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had insisted that Paul give them a shooting script of the picture , which he had hastened to do . A week later they wrote us to be careful not to show any pictures of straw-thatched huts or dirty streets . Also they noted that we planned to have some pictures of an Indian guide . How was the guide to be dressed ? The censors thought it unwise to allow any pictures of a ragged Indian to be shown . To make sure on this point , Paul got a tailor to make up a special suit for our guide , a sort of glorification of the usual Indian costume . The guide refused to be seen in public with it on . He said it made him look like a sissy . So all our pictures of him had to be taken in the solitude of the hills . Like everyone who has ever seen a movie , Jule and I had very definite ideas on how one should be done . One of our chief grievances has been the long list of screen credits that always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one cares who was the assistant cameraman , who designed the costumes , who swept up the lot afterward , and all the rest of it . We told each other proudly that in this picture there would be no screen credits . Finally we mentioned our resolve to Paul . He agreed with us completely . " Of course , " he added , " the producer in New York will want credit . Then the men who do the cutting will have to get a mention . " " But why ? " we asked . " Well , you see , if the picture is good , it 's a reputation builder for them . Take my case , for instance . I would n't dream of coming dolrn here to make this picture unless I was sure of getting a credit line as director . And , of course , John Green will have to get mention as cameraman . " We could see this was beginning to be complicated . " What about us ? " asked Jule . " Well , " said Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I doubt it very much . I tell you what , " he went on , his face brightening . " Why not cut down the list of screen credits by just omitting your-selves ? " At last we came to the climax of the picture  --  the fight between Aguila and a giant iguana . We had thought at first that John would just follow Aguila in flight with his camera while she went iguana hunting , but by the time John had taken a light reading , got his tripod set up , focused on the scene and adjusted his filters , Aguila and the iguana were some miles away . So we staged the fight on the side of a hill with the biggest iguana we could get , and John set up reflectors and measured distances to his hearts content . Nevertheless , the fight was not easy to take . The animals covered quite a bit of territory in their combat , and every time John switched his turret head to a three-inch lens , both Aguila and the iguana charged in to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperately over to a one-inch . Just as the two contestants came to grips , he invariably ran out of film , and we had to wait until he could put in a fresh magazine . To make matters worse , we had discovered that this iguana would eat from our hands . All the iguanas we had brought back for the Philadelphia Zoological Gardens the year before had died , because they refused to eat in captivity . So we were determined that Aguila would n't kill this one . Every time the two gladiators really came to grips , we rushed in and pulled them apart , to the great annoyance not only of Paul and John but also of Aguila and the iguana . But at last the fight was filmed and the picture in the can . Our camera crew left shortly afterward , expressing the parting wish that they would never see an eagle or an iguana again . That night Jule went over our accounts while I prepared to answer a collection of letters from friends , all of whom were congratulating me on being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said finally , after reading letter after letter , " how much did we really make on this picture ? " " Well , " said Jule doubtfully , looking over her figures , " after paying for the trip down here , the board and lodging of all of us , including the eagles , the rent for the house , the wages of the guides , and rent for the horses and burros , I think , if we 're very careful , we can just about split even . " Regretfully , we prepared to leave Mexico . For the last two years we have brought down from the States little presents for our small staff of servants . Pm afraid there was some touch of condescension in this . " The poor things ca n't get so many useful things there that we have in New York , " Jule used to say . " Really , some of the conditions they live under are really primitive . " But this year the tables were turned . The servants all gave us presents to take back with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric iron she had bought for her in Mexico City . Chon , our little houseboy , gave me a package of razor blades . Our maid gave Jule a packet of bobby pins . Our kitchen maid presented us with two pounds of sugar . When the time came for us to go , old Marie , our cook , broke down on Jule 's shoulder . " My poor little sefiora ! " she wailed . " I hate to see you go to that terrible place where they do n't even have gasoline or tires . And to New York too Why , I read in the papers they do n't even have hot water there any more ! How will the poor senor shave ! " " I know , Marie , " Jule sobbed . " Conditions there are not like Mexico . But it 's our home , and , in spite of its crudeness , we love it . But we 'll try to come back soon , and you must have a big cup of coffee with lots of sugar for us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @
