Lord Haw-Haw , the humbug of Hamburg , <P> The life of the town , full of fun ; <P> But still , in the winter , he 's rather pathetic , <P> He 's frozen to death , for his pants are synthetic . <P> Lord Haw-Haw , the humbug of Hamburg , <P> The hee-hawing , high-browing Hun . <P> Lord Haw-Haw , the mysterious Nazi propagandist with the frozen British accent , has had more than his share of 1940 Mother Goose . When British aircraft flew over Germany one night last week , Nazi transmitters ( including Lord Haw-Haw 's station at Hamburg ) blanked out as usual so that their waves could not be used for directional purposes by the invaders . A BBC funster gibed : " He shouts with rage and screams with fear , but pipes down when our planes are near . " <P> No one has yet accused the Royal Air Force of undertaking its German night flights to attack its No. 1 propaganda problem , but one British woman did write that she thought the R. A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Haw-Haw . Lord Haw-Haw 's nightly talks are a " must " on some 50% of Great Britain 's 9,000,000 licensed radio sets . He disparages British war aims , takes precise potshots at slum conditions , colonial policies , commiserates with war-discomforted Britons at home . As the Socialist Forward recently warned : " He blandly takes the British public by the ear and turns its startled gaze on the examples of incompetence and even criminal injustice of our politicians , " singling out facts which " a smug press has succeeded in keeping out of the headlines . " <P> Actually , Lord Haw-Haw is no better informed than any one of several other English speakers on the German radio . The difference is that he has been ridiculed to fame . The Daily Express 's Jonah Barrington dubbed him Haw-Haw last September . BBC comics lost no time ribbing him in rhyme . He became a character in a revue , was impersonated at Mayfair affairs . Trying to figure out his real identity became a national British pastime . He was spotted as ( among others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naziism in Scotland ; 2 ) Norman Baillie-Stewart , famed ex-Seaforth Highlander once clapped in the Tower of London for betraying military secrets ( and now thought to be Scotty , propagandist and master of ceremonies on the twice-weekly Cabaret in English on the Nazi radio ) ; 3 ) Henry William Wicks , onetime London insurance man now living in Germany with his Nazi-minded wife . Listeners got into learned dispute over his accent . It was aristocratic , public-school , phony . Novelist Rose Macaulay pronounced it " a slight provincial accent ( Manchester ? ) . " <P> Last week it appeared that all guesses were wild . Lord Haw-Haw , according to the latest ( and only official ) identification , was born in the U. S. As the latest story goes , the Sunday Pictorial last December interviewed a woman in the tiny village of Waldron , Sussex . She was sure Lord Haw-Haw was her ex-husband , William Joyce . To make doubly sure , she tuned him in one night when her small daughters were in the room . The eldest child paled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked .
