Early one night last week , the doorbell began ringing at a fashionable old apartment in Stoneleigh Court , a stone 's throw from Washington 's Mayflower Hotel . The callers were admitted by Kansas ' 76-year-old Senator Clyde Reed , ushered in with a cautious admonition : " Now boys , this is not a drinking party . " The warning was unnecessary . The men who gathered in the handsome , antique-filled room had come with a dead serious purpose . <P> They met in an effort to frame a Republican approach to the European Recovery Program-an approach which would differ somewhat from Senator Vandenberg 's participation in the so-called bipartisan foreign policy . Republicans wanted to make sure that whatever total amount was appropriated for ERP was really necessary , and that the administration of ERP would be in competent hands . They also wanted to find a way in which the Republican Congress could put its label on the plan . <P> The Inheritors . The moving spirit of the gathering was Majority Whip Kenneth Wherry , the ex-isolationist from Nebraska . Among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Ohio 's John Bricker , Illinois ' " Curley " Brooks , Missouri 's James Kem . In all , 20 Republican Senators turned up . Except for California 's Bill Knowland , all were men who had been stirring restlessly under the bipartisan policy . All had been growing increasingly critical of Arthur Vandenberg 's willingness to work with the Administration . <P> When newsmen heard of the meeting and took a look at the guest list , they thought they saw the ghosts of the little group of irreconcilables who kept the U.S. out of the League of Nations . There was some excuse for the parallel . <P> But within 48 hours , Ken Wherry was indignantly on the defensive . " We are not going to form an anti-anything bloc , " he protested . " It was just a meeting to see what should be done about the Marshall Plan . This was not a move to split the party but a meeting to see what could be done about avoiding differences of opinion on the floor . " <P> As more details seeped out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After hours of discussion , opinion had crystallized on one point : the State Department could not be trusted to handle either the dollars or the distribution of U.S. aid . Except for half a dozen bitter-enders , most were willing to accept the Marshall Plan in principle-but with some Republican trimmings . <P> Substantial Change . What that meant was becoming increasingly clear . Even Arthur Vandenberg was privately convinced that the Administration 's bill could and would have to stand substantial change . He had already publicly tipped his hand by agreeing with a suggestion of World Bank President John J. McCloy . The proposal : that ERP include a formula for " progressive credits " - i.e. , make the amount of aid extended dependent on the rate of the economic recovery . <P> That was one amendment that would be sure to please the potential rebels . There were others . The money to be spent on ERP would probably now be fixed somewhere between the $4 billion which Bob Taft had urged as the top limit , and the $6.8 billion Administration figure which Vandenberg still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a separate agency , with the State Department limited to passing on political issues .
