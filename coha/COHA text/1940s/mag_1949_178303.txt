Managing Editor Russell McGrath of the conservative , successful Seattle Times ( circ. 208,442 ) wound up his instructions to Reporter Edwin O. Guthman . Leaning across the desk in his office , McGrath told Guthman : " The courts have broken down . Now it 's our job to find out the truth . " <P> Guthman hustled out of the city room with a long-term assignment : to find the truth about Melvin Rader , professor of philosophy at the University of Washington . Before the state legislature 's Committee on Un-American Activities in July 1948 , Melvin Rader had been labeled a Communist . His accuser , ex-Communist George Hewitt , charged that Rader had attended a secret party school near Kingston , N.Y . for six weeks in the summer of 1938 . Rader 's reply was a detailed denial : he was not a Communist , and he had spent the summer of 1938 in Seattle and at Canyon Creek Lodge , a nearby Washington mountain resort . <P> Who Is Innocent ? When his denial went unnoticed , Rader took another step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while a deputy prosecutor cooled his heels outside the offices of the Canwell committee ( named for ex-State Representative Albert F. Canwell ) , Hewitt was packed aboard a plane for New York . There , a Bronx court refused to extradite him . Though Rader continued to teach at the University of Washington , his reputation was blasted . <P> Reporter Guthman , a husky young ( 30 ) Purple Heart veteran of the Italian cam paign and a University of Washington graduate who had been covering the Can-well hearings for two years , started his digging by driving to Canyon Creek . <P> There , he asked to see the 1938 guest register . It was missing ; it had been " borrowed " by Canwell committee investigators and never returned . But Guthman found an ex-housekeeper who clearly recalled the 1938 visit and added a corroborating detail : Mrs. Rader was pregnant . <P> For two months , Reporter Guthman gathered additional evidence that Rader was telling the truth . He found an optician 's record to prove that Rader had broken his glasses at the Washington resort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawn books in Seattle during the time he had supposedly been 3,000 miles away , and a Seattle voting record . <P> Who Is Guilty ? Then Guthman took the evidence to President Raymond B. Allen of the University of Washington . Last week , the Times headlined the story of Guthman 's detective work - and President Allen 's decision - on Page One . Said Allen : " I have examined the evidence assembled by Professor Rader and the Seattle Times ... I consider that Professor Rader was falsely accused . " <P> This week , having cleared the innocent , the Times was trying to find out who was guilty . From the state attorney general , the speaker of the house and the president of the senate , Reporter Guthman extracted a promise to search the Canwell committee 's sealed records for the missing resort register . Snapped Canwell : " If you think the register has been suppressed , go find it . "
