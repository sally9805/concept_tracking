All week the Allies rolled up the shin of the Italian boot , while the northern end of the main Italian battle line stood silent . The aim of Allied Commander Sir Harold R.L.G. Alexander seemed clear : to push back the German right flank , smash into it with his troops at the Anzio beachhead . <P> Mighty Cassino , famed northern anchor of the 25-mile " G for Gustav " Line , fell early ( see below ) . West of the fallen fortress , the Poles pushed into Piedimonte and uprooted the anchor of the supposedly powerful secondary " Hitler Line . " <P> Strongest points on this mountainous line were probably between Pontecorvo and Pico , roughly a third of the way from Cassino to the sea . This week the fast-advancing French threw a block on the five-mile road between them , went to work to take both towns . <P> On the South Flank . In terms of miles , U.S. troops made the biggest gains . From Minturno on the south of the line one column pushed into the little mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another column pounded along the coast to the town of Formia . <P> Nearly all the Germans had pulled out . They were gone , too , from Gaeta . The troops , watched by Lieut . General Mark Clark ( who narrowly escaped being blown up by an exploding land mine ) , then pushed on into Itri and Fondi . This week U.S. patrols fought into Terracina , were thrown out , waited to fight their way back when the main bodies came up . <P> In the Rear Areas . Apparently the smashup of German communications by Allied airmen , before the push began , had worked a change in the Germans ' will and ability to fight in their most competent fashion . There was also a well-grounded suspicion among U.S. officers that Field Marshal Kesselring may have been outwitted to boot . <P> One of his Orders of the Day , captured by Allied troops , told the Germans to be ready for an attack on May 24 ( it began on May 11 ) . Another instance of bad intelligence : Kesselring showered Polish-language propaganda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> In spite of all these favorable circumstances , Allied troops suffered heavy casualties at some points on the line . But on the whole , the Allied Command announced , casualties were much lighter than expected . Conversely the signs of tactical surprise among German front-line troops were greater than anyone had hoped . By week 's end the Allies had taken 6,000 Axis prisoners . Considering the proved military quality of the German outfits , it was a fat bag , indicated that some divisions may have been shot apart so badly that they could no longer function as units . <P> The Newest Allies . One clear reason for the spectacular Allied advance was the heroic determination of the troops Hitler had to stop . Almost unanimously , correspondents picked as their fighting favorites the French troops-Moroccan Goums , Senegalese infantrymen and Algerian riflemen serving under French officers and noncoms . Some of them had actually fought on opposite sides in the Fighting French-Vichy squabbles in Syria three years ago . <P> Their General Alphonse Pierre Juin and his high-ranking associates also took the eyes of true soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brigadier general : " Look at him-right up at the front . They are all that way-goddam emotional but they go right up there with their men . "
