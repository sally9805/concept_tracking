This year 's Kentucky Derby will be run at Churchill Downs this Saturday . Each year , in the past three years , there has been an outstanding winter-book favorite : in 1938 , Stagehand ; in 1939 , El Chico ; last year , Bimelech . But this year there has been no Big Horse . <P> Warren Wright 's Whirlaway , top money winner among last year 's juveniles , lost prestige in Florida in losing two of his first three races as a three-year-old . Our Boots , who showed his heels to Whirlaway in three races last year ( including the Belmont Futurity ) , looked good to some folks-particularly his owner , Millionaire Royce Martin of Toledo , and his trainer , cadaverous old Steve Judge . But superstitious fans remembered that no Belmont Futurity winner has ever won the Ken tucky Derby . <P> Last week Whirlaway and Our Boots met in the mile-and-an-eighth Blue Grass Stakes , traditional Derby preview , at Lex ington , Ky . It was a holiday in horsy Lexington . Both Whirlaway and Boots were born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who knew that Our Boots , by Bulldog out of Maid of Arches , comes from a family notable for speed rather than staying qualities , made Whirlaway the favorite . <P> Two other Derby eligibles were entered , just to make a race of it : Valdina Paul and Valdina Groom , two of Texan Emerson Woodward 's herd , all named Valdina Something-or-other , that have invaded U.S. tracks this year . But from the flag 's fall it was a two-horse race . Our Boots was ridden by little Conn McCreary , who is so small he looks like a pussycat on a horse . Puss McCreary acted like a wise old cat . Leading from the start , he eased Our Boots in the backstretch , let Whirlaway get in front . Then , rounding the home turn , Puss and Boots shot past Whirlaway , three , four , five , six lengths at the wire . Explained disappointed Kentuckians : Whirly wo n't run unless there is someone in front of him-he loses interest . " Do n't count him out , " they chirped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> But bookmakers promptly made Our Boots an 8-to-5 favorite . Quoted at 4-to-1 were Whirlaway and Charles S. Howard 's Porter 's Cap ( son of The Porter and The Blonde ) , who ran away with the rich Santa Anita Derby last February . At 8-to-1 were Texan Robert Kleberg 's Dispose , big horse of Florida 's winter season , and J. Frederick Byers ' Robert Morris , a 200-to-1 shot in the winter books-before he outran half a dozen older horses in the Excelsior Handicap at Jamaica last fortnight . <P> Still , the horseshoe of roses may well go to a longshot-such as Blue Pair , Little Beans or Market Wise , who was an unlikely starter until he beat King Cole , the East 's leading candidate , in the Wood Memorial at Jamaica last week . Market Wise 's owner , a Long Island businessman named Louis Tufano , took part of the $16.000 he won , hired a private car , shipped his Cinderella horse to Churchill Downs .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
