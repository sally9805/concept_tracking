Loretta Young had quite a time in London . She curtsied to the Queen at a command performance ; she saw the city 's patched-up ruins ; she thought it simply wonderful how plucky the British were in their gloom-bound island . When she got safely home to California , she poured out her impressions to sympathetic Gene Handsaker , an A.P . feature writer , who set it all down in heart-throbbing prose . Sample quotes : <P> Loopy ? Absurd ? " ' You get the feeling over there that people are tired , drained of feeling ' . . . . A business executive was walking on cardboard-patched soles for lack of a ration coupon . . . A tiny girl asked , when given a bit of coveted chocolate : ' Do I lick or do I bite ? ' . . . Factory workers faint around 11 a.m. for lack of adequate breakfasts . . . . ' In two weeks I never saw a piece of meat ' . . . Seventy-five pounds of food she brought over prolonged the lives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved not quite so drained of feeling as Loretta thought . When the A.P . story appeared in London papers , Londoners snorted or guffawed . Said a bus conductor : " She must be loopy . " " Absurd , " snapped Cockney Sally , who ' serves afternoon tea in a London office . <P> Huffed plump Sir Alexander Maxwell , leader of Britain 's tourist drive : " I trust Miss Young will have the good sense to retract . . . . There is not an atom of truth in any of her statements . . . . " <P> Grinned the Daily Herald : " The case of the cardboard-soled business executive is very moving . Did he , we wonder , try to touch Miss Young for a taxi fare ? . . . If she is aware of the achievements of our nation in industrial output . . . she must surely realize that a tired people . . . could scarcely perform such feats . " The Daily Mirror was avuncular : " Miss Young . . . has a kind heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own modest state may have made the film star ultrasensitive . . . . " <P> The Moral ? Next day , Loretta'Young divulged her sources : the executive 's shoes story came from a U.S. woman correspondent ( who , apparently , does n't know that coupons are n't required for resoling shoes ) . The **31;12226;TOOLONG incident was told her by a British waiter , whose little boy had shared a bar with a neighboring girl . Londoners thought that " Do I lick or do I bite ? " might be a polite , childish equivalent for " How much can I have ? " Loretta 's scoop on the fainting factory workers was from a housewife who said it was a problem to get enough food for her husband 's breakfast . <P> The moral , if any , seemed to be that grousing was one British product not intended for the export trade .
