txt President Truman signed today the bill barring billions of dollars ' worth of portal-to-portal pay claims , past and future , because he believed " that in the interest of the economic stability of our nation , it is essential to clarify this matter by statute . " In his message to Congress the President again urged that the minimum wage provided by the Pair Labor Standards Act be increased from the present 40 cents an hour to 65 cents . He also asked that minimum wage benefits be extended to many persons not protected by the law . Without referring to them by name , the President took issue with spokesmen for organized labor as well as a member of his own Cabinet , Lewis B. Schwellenbach , Secretary of Labor , who had argued that the bill would weaken the wage-hour law . Industrial Men Surprised The President 's message was re .. ceived by industrial spokesmen with gratification and surprise . They had believed that even if Mr. Truman signed the measure he would couple it with a criticism lof their point of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as recently as fortyeight hours ago , called on the President to veto the bill , expressed keen disappointment . Neither William Green nor Philip Murray , respective presidents of the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations , would comment . However , it was reported in labor and industrial circles that an early test of the law 's constitutionality would probably be started , As soon as the first petitions for dismissal of pending suits are heard , the question will be ready to be rushed from the Federal District Courts to the higher tribunals . Representative John W. Gwynne , Republican , of Iowa , said that the President 's interpretation of the measure was virtually the same as he offered the House during debate on the bill . Acts on Wage Proposal The President 's reference to the need for raising the minimum wage was taken up at once in the House , where Chairman Fred A. Hartley Jr . of New Jersey made it clear that he would hold open hearings of the Labor Committee if his Republican colleagues approved . Chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Public Welfare also indicated that he would not object to hearings by his committee . He added that such // action would not be fruitful , however , unless the House was also prepared to act . The new act would outlaw most of the court claims which , according to the Senate Judiciary Committee , amounted to $5,785,204,606 on Jan. 31 , 1947 . This figure covered , suits filed between July 1 , 1946 , and that date . The suits were based on the Mount Clemens ( Mich. ) pottery case , which was upheld in the Supreme Court in June , 1946 . Subsequently Federal Judge Frank Picard Invalidated his earlier favorable ruling , then the Mount Clemens case was dismissed in the Circuit Court on request of Edward Lamb , union counsel . In his message , Mr. Truman stated that the claims that had " emerged since judicial interpretation of the ' wage and hour law ' raised the possibility that employers might be required to pay back wages for certain activities which in most industries have not previously been considered by either workers or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should end this uncertainty with respect to claims of still undetermined magnitude , " he said , adding : " Current wage negotiations can proceed more readily to a satisfactory conclusion , and businessmen will be able to plan with assurance for full protection and price reductions . This will be of real value to labor and management in the maintenance of a continued high level of employment . " Mr. Truman argued that it was not the purpose of the act " to permit violation of our fundamental wage and hour standards or to allow a lowering of these standards . " The " plain language " of Section 2 , he said , " preserves minimum wage and overtime compensation claims based upon activities which were compensable in any amount under contract , custom or practice . " He emphasized that the act provided that all " principal activities " must be paid for regardless of contract , custom and practice , then added : Mr. Schwellenbach had insisted the bill would cripple the wage and hour law , but Tom C. Clark , Attorney General , thought otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Commerce of the United States , said : " Business men are very glad that this bill has become law . Its provisions provide substantial relief from a threat of ' hidden bankruptcy ' which has confronted a great number and variety of businesses , including many small establishments . It is an aid to sound business progress which will benefit the entire economy . " ' The new law bars virtually all pending and future claims unless covered by a wage contract or industry custom . Suits may not be filed more than two years after claimed work has been completed . Employers may offer b " c  --  ood faith " defenses if they prove they relied upon Government rulings . Pending pay claims can be compromised , and pay demands based on regular work day activities are left to collective bargaining or court settlement . As to future - claims , courts receive discretion as to Whether triple damages are to be awarded . At present the courts have no such discretion .
