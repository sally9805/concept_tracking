along the narrow flagged pavement , his eyes still used to the lighted pub . The voices around him seemed eerily disembodied . Time had crawled like a beetle , and the night noises of insects had become pandemonium . But they faded into forgetfulness as he heard her coming into the darker-than-darkness under the tree . He slipped from the wall . " Hello , " he said . " Hello . " They stood quietly , not knowing what to say . " I 'm glad you came , " he said , finally . " I 'm not , " she said . " Why not ? " " I still feel a little like a kitchen maid on her night out . " " You make it sound very attractive , " he said , harshly . " If you feel like that  --  what did you come for ? " " Because , " she said . " Because I kept thinking you 'd look like such a fool , sitting on this wall  --  if I did n't . " His senses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poised tone . In the darkness there was no distance between them . He moved nearer , until he thought he could feel the warmth of her face affecting the skin of his cheek . But they did not touch . He rocked backwardslightly . " Nice of you to think of me , " he said . " And now  --  since you look at it that way  --  we might as well go back . " " Perhaps it would be better , " she said , coolly . They walked down the road in the blackness , going slowly and withoutspeaking . Then , in a curious manner , their common malaise gave them kinship . " You do n't mind my walking with you , at least ? " he said . " No . It 's good of you to see me back , " she said . " This way . " She was moving through the grass at the edge of the road . " It 's a stile , " she said . " Can you see ? " " Not a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it well enough . " He felt the warmth of her palm as he climbed the wooden steps . " It 's much shorter over the meadow , " she said . He followed her in the narrow path . At first he marveled at her surenessin following it . Then he found it easy to follow , too . In the years of40coming and going the path had been tamped into a smooth runnel and one 's feet bumped the turfed edge when they went astray . The blackout was giving new dimensions to some of the senses . " Man used to live without lights  --  once , " he said . " Yes . " He realized that he had assumed in a curious way that her mind had followed his . Yet she was distant . He looked at the starlit sky and stumbled , bumping into her . " Sorry . " " Not at all . " Her voice sounded small , feminine . He was sorry for her . " How are things up in the purely feminine world ? " " Fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know . " " You know ? " " Yes . You told me . Remember ? " " Oh , that . " He felt his attempt to comfort her was missing fire . " Oh , now , " he said . " I 'm really sorry  --  about tonight . You understand that , do n't you . " Her voice came back in the darkness . " I 'm sorry , too . You 'll pardon me , wo n't you ? " " It 's all right . You can do as you like . It 's a free country  --  they say . " " It 's just  --  I suppose I 'm not going to be any good at this sort of thing . And if I say anything  --  I suppose it sounds like all the coy things a girl 's supposed to say and does n't mean . " " No , it 's nice of you to try to explain . Do n't be upset . " She laughed . " The silly thing is , I 'm rather upset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're decent about it . " " I 'm a Galahad . My word  --  what 's that there ? " " It 's only the haystack . " " Heavens , I thought it was a diplodocus . Looming up like that . " She halted . " Is this far enough ? " he said . " Yes , thank you . " They stood in silence . " Shall we sit down ? " he said , finally . " We 've signed the armistice . " " Step number one , " she said , in a small voice. 41He heard her sitting in the hay . He sat beside her and the rustle ended . Not seeing her , he was even more aware of her presence . They were silent long enough to hear their own breathing . He felt that she was waiting . He felt her shiver . " Are you cold ? " " Just a little  --  I think . " He fumbled in his pocket . " Will you have a drink ? " He heard her breath come and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " she said . But her hand followed along his arm until it reached his hand . " The cork 's out , " he said . " That 's proper upbringing . My mothertold me always to take the cork from the bottle before you offered it toa lady . " He heard her laugh . " Especially if it 's a lady in a haystack , " she said . He sat with his elbows on his knees , not wishing to answer . He heard the soft gurgle . Then she said : " Here . " Ile took the bottle and drank . The whisky crept hotly to the edges of his brain . The earth seemed to tilt slightly , and stayed atilt . He put the cork back , carefully . " Did you ever get stinko ? " he said . " Blind , unconscious stinko ? " " No . Have you ? " " Yes . Two nights ago . Blind ! Blotto ! Out ! " " Sounds restful . What does it feel like ? " " Fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . but rather magnificent in a way . Empty , tired , chastened . In a way , rather purified and shriven -- as if all your psychic sins had been bleached away  --  or washed clown the sink , or something . " It sounds as if it 's exactly the thing I need . I might try it . " " I 'll be honest , my lass . There 's something I did n't mention . The headache the next morning . " " I ' 11 risk it . May I have the bottle ? " He passed it to her , and then held it as their hands touched . " There 's remorse , perhaps , too , " he said . " You sound like my own conscience . I do n't believe in remorse . Let go . He let go of the bottle. 442 " And a feeling in your stomach , " he said . " As if bile-green boats were pitching on a warm , greasy , dishwater sea . " " Now you sound like Mephisto , having successfully tempted someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove that he warned them . " " Yes , I 'm a stinker , are n't I ? But be warned . . . " " It 's too late now , " she said . " Will you tell me when I 'm getting stinko  --  blind stinko ? " " You 'll know . " " I do n't feel anything . " " A delayed action effect . Wait a few minutes . " " No . I do n't get drunk . I 've drunk ever so much . Last Christmas at home I tried  --  I drank and drank . It did n't do any good . " " Do n't get discouraged . " " I 'll try again . " " No . Wait a while . You 'll be sick . " " It 's my sick if I want to be . " " If you say . " He gave her the bottle , and waited until he heard her breath expelled . He reached out and took it away . " Should I see you back to camp ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and now you want to hurry me back to camp . Is that being a Galahad ? " " I think perhaps it is  --  just that . " " No it is n't . It 's more I-told-you-so to your own conscience . So that no matter what happens , you can say to yourself : Well , I offered to take her back . ' You do n't really want to go back . " " Nonsense . " " It 's true . " " Yes , I suppose so . " " All right . Then we 'll sit here and talk . We 'll talk about you , " she said . " What about me ? " " What did you want to see me again for ? " " Oh , nothing much . " He wished she would stop talking . Her voice sounded strained . " It 's just that I 'm woman . " " Nonsense . " " It is . You do n't know me . We 've never even seen each other in the431light . You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman  --  something in skirts . " " Well , I 'm something in pants . Pants and Skirts , that 's all , " he said , harshly . " Yes . It does sound revolting , " she said . Her voice sounded thin and far away . " Pants meets Skirts , " she went on . " Object , seduction . Shortest distance between two points . " " You 're gabbling . " " I have a right to if I want . " " You 're getting tipsy . " " My head is perfectly clear . That was the idea , was n't it  --  casualseduction of one of the Waifs . Walk arm in arm . Then clinch . Thenthat 's the part where it always fades out in the cinema . I wonder why ? " " Because the cinema has more sense than to try to talk about it . " " But it was your idea , was n't it ? Tell me the truth ? " She was clutching his arm . He took his hand and lifted hers away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say I wanted to see you because you 're beautiful  --  I have n't seen you enough to know whether or not you are . " " I 'm not  --  not very . " " And I ca n't say I asked you out for conversational exercise or a little chitchat . Or perhaps you can sing  --  or do parlor tricks . " " And that leaves  --  only the other thing . " She sat quietly . In a childish rebelliousness he determined not to speak before she did . " It 's no good , " she said . Her voice had changed . It was soft and small . " I would n't be any good at it . " " At what ? " " You know . I think I 'd be very disappointing . You 'd better go after someone else . It would . . . " Her voice trailed away . Then she spoke brightly . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " Well , we 've talked about me . Now let 's talk about you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do I think about you , eh ? " She laughed quickly , and for a second his car was held by a sort of round beauty in the tone . " Give me another drink , " she said . " Are you getting drunk ? " 441 " Not in my head . But it 's certainly helping me to talk . " " Ah , a garrulous drunk . " She took no notice of what he said . After a pause she spoke . " Now . What do you do ? " " I 'm on a holiday . " " A holiday ! This is a fine time . " " What 's wrong with it ? " " What 's wrong ? Well , there is a little thing like a war on . There 's need for everyone to work . And  --  well " Well , what ? " " Oh , you 'll be angry . " " How do you know ? " " I do know  --  but I do n't give a damn . Why are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damned recruiting poster . Why should I be ? " " Decency . That 's why . To be decent to yourself . " " You sound like Colonel Blimp . " " Why not ? We women can get in it . And there 's young men like you  --  well , if I were a man I 'd . . . " " Fight the war with your mouth probably . I punched a fat chap in the nose the other night for just that line . " " Listen , " she said . " There 's work to do . If I were a man , I would n't hold back because my age had n't been called , or because I could claim exemption on grounds of essentials of employment . I 'd enlist . I 'd stand in line to enlist ! I 'd . . . " " Oh , be quiet . " " Are you a conscientious objector ? " " Be quiet . You do n't know what you 're talking about . " " Then why are n't you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I said , why are n't you in the army ? " " Talk sex again , you make more sense . " " Why are n't you in the army ? " " Oh , for God 's sake , be quiet , " he said . " I am in the army . " " In the army  --  then what are you doing in civilian clothes ? " " A man can wear civilian clothes if he wants , ca n't he ? I 'm on leave . I put on civilian clothes . " " I would n't be ashamed to wear my uniform . " " It is n't being ashamed . I want to forget it for a while . " 45 l " I know , " she said , slowly . " Just as I want to forget the Waifs sometimes . " " Now , we 've talked about me , " he said . " Shall we go ? " " Not yet . Ca n't we have another drink ? " " There 's just about one apiece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then  --  to the two services . The uniform forever ! " " Nuts , " he said . " Please ! " " Sorry . All right , then . To the Buffs , my lass , and a couple of egads ! The 1890 port , Clinkers ! And damme no heeltaps ! " She passed him the bottle . " Now I do feel dizzy , " she said . " It would be an awful waste of whisky if you did n't by this time . " " I feel fine . " " You wo n't in the morning . Now , shall we go ? " " No , " she said . " It 's very nice here . " She lay back in the hay , and he bent and found her mouth and kissed her . She did not move . " You make the first advances very nicely , " she said . He sat up . " Oh , damn it , let 's go back , " he said . " What are you trying to find out ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not answer . She put her hand out to his knee and let it rest there . " Wait a moment , please , " she said . " Just be still a while . " For a long time she lay , quietly . Then she moved . " Come here , " she said . She pulled his head slowly toward her . Then she kissed him . He cradled her head with one ann . The other hand found her breast . " I e gentle , " she said , very softly . " Ile gentle , and I wo n't be frightened . " I lc kissed her again . She put a halting hand on his chest . Her voice was a whisper . " A uni form is n't a very handy thing to make love in , " she said . " Wait a second . I 've got to take something off . " He did not answer . A few seconds later he felt her arms reaching for him , warmly . But afterwards she said : " So it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? " 46 " Under a hedge is commoner , " he said , coldly . She lay back quietly . " I suppose now , " she said , " you 'll be able to go back to camp and talk about it : the girl from the Waifs you met and  --  what would your word be for it ? " " A much honester one than you 're thinking of , " he said . " And you 'll have the consolation of knowing you 've done so much for one of the boys in khaki . It 's all in the name of patriotism . Think how virtuous and self-righteous you 'll feel . " He turned his head away . Then he heard a movement and her hand was touching his head . " Do n't , " she said . " It is n't right of us to talk like this , is it ? " " It was you . . . " " There , there , " she said . " Now . .. " Her hand stroked his forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out into the blackness . The hand went on and on , moving in a comforting way as if she were suddenly the older and wiser of the two . He began to know only the stillness of night and the oversweet smell of hay . Then , like the turning off of a water tap , time stopped . When it began again , he was sitting up , holding her arm . He heard the tail end of his own words : " Who ? Who is it ? " " Do n't , " she said . " You hurt . It 's me ? " " Of course it is , " he said , fully awake . He leaned forward and rubbed the palms of his hands over his temples " Sorry , " he said . " I 've got an awful headache . Was I dreaming ? " " You must have been . You were asleep a long time , and you begangrinding your teeth horribly . When I wakened you , you almost brokemy arm . " " Sorry . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and held out his hand . He did not think it curious that she should be expecting it , nor that she should find it unerringly in the dark . Ile pulled her to her feet . Unspeaking , in a dreamy sort of sleepy peace , they went along the path toward the camp . CHAP TER VII THAT week the war had drawn nearer . It was hard to realize it con- sciously . One always thought of wars as being far away . " The front "  --  that was always in some other land . Now it was England . The front  --  it was becoming all England . London  --  the counties  --  it was all the front now ; only the battles were fought over the land instead of on it . In the daytime the R.A.F. was shooting down his planes  --  but at night it was different . At night the bombers were getting through in ones and twos . But at first one could n't really believe in the war , even at night . Not even when the air-raid warnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky and wave back and forth , and , sometimes , anti-aircraft guns would cut loose . It was hard to think of England as the front . In those August nights people would go into the streets and look up . There was little to see . The guns kept banging away , going like the thump of a trip hammer . The guns sounded loud , but when the shell burst there was only a tiny sound like the popping of a small paper bag . It seemed a silly , weak little noise . There would he just that pop ; or sometimes there would be a brief pinprick of light , like a star that was born and lived and ( lied in one second . In the small towns , when alarms sounded , policemen rode on bicycles and scolded the people in the streets . The people would not take it serf ously . It seemed somehow sullying and un-British to scurry away from a danger that could n't be true . And war right in England could n't be true . Even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could happen to England was a sort of thunder shower . These people stood in 48 doorways and looked up impassively , or stayed inside and peeped through the curtains occasionally . Somehow they felt quite safe doing that . They were quite protected from this new sort of rain that never came . Most of them had no understanding of high explosives that ripped stone and steel and flesh , that killed people one hundred feet away merely by the concussion that ruptured the cells and fiber of the lungs and left a man unscratched yet dying . True , some older men who knew this from the last war thought of itandyet they could n't make it real . A man could die so in a foreign landbutnot here , at home , in Britain . So children raced in the streets seeking hot shell splinters for souvenirs , and women peeked placidly through the curtains , and the A.R.P . men went about scolding the people for spoiling the blackout . A light from one window , multiplied a hundred times , they said , was enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came , it always seemed fantastic and impossible , even to the A.R.P . men themselves . True , there would be news of some bombs dropped . But it was always somewhere else  --  over the Hampshire border , or far out on the lonesome Downs . That was a long way away . It always seemed a long way away in daylight , and especially such fine daylight . Such fantastically beautiful weather it was . The wheat was bursting into full ear . There were a lot of tiny , blue butterflies over the south grasslands . And in the fair sunshine it all seemed silly . The Air Raid Precautions people , the Local Defense Volunteers , the parashots , the auxiliary firemen  --  theylooked like silly badged and armletted and dressed-up figures left over from last night 's puppet show . They must have felt it themselves . They looked a little sheepish , wearing their brassards and walking about in broad daylight . It was all ludicrous in the sunshine  --  fat men and young lads and meeklittle clerks and spinster ladies and red-faced old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs of authority . In the 1 daylight . Only at night some people began to feel something . In the I ' blackness they began to feel war , real war , edging nearer and nearer . Old Hamish felt suddenly merrier as he sat in the park . He had not gone home after all , and he was glad of it . His irritation at London 1,1 was gone. 49The perfection of the greenery , the dappling of afternoon light and shadow , the neatness of the walks , the splashing of colors on the clothes of the children , the uniformed nursemaids  --  this was as it should be . This had not changed . London itself had changed  --  for the worse  --  had become cheap , tinny . But this was as it had been for as far back as his memory went . And it would be for as long as  --  as long as He put the thought away . You could think and argue pro and con ; but Britain would be Britain always . For this was really Britain . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there 'd always be Britain . He felt there was a flaw somewhere in that reasoning , but he liked the comfort of the conclusion , so he turned his mind away from analysis . He looked sideways at the nursemaid on the bench with him , holding a paper-back novelette . She would read three or four lines and look up . Read three or four lines  --  look up . It went on regularly , like a conditionedreflex . Reading  --  then looking to see if the child was all right . Old Hamish watched the children . They were going round in circles , their hands clenched beside their chests , shuffling their feet and making moaning cries in some incomprehensible sort of game . They seemed much alike . All nice little shavers . All of them clean and nicely dressed . All extremely beautiful as only infancy can be when seen through adult eyes . Old Hamish felt the sun on his face . He half-drowsed . Then he wakenedto sound as a boy trotted over . He had a fawn reefer jacket , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British child . " We 're playing buzzers , " he said . " What ? " the nurse asked . " Buzzers . I'ni the twelve o'clock buzzer . " " That 's nice , " she said , absently . " t'ume here . " She wet her handkerchief on her tongue and dabbed briskly at the corner of his mouth . " " There , " she said . The child ran away , and both Hamish and the nurse followed him with their eyes. llaunish was thinking : Curious  --  their fingernails . Like the tiny crabs they 'd had in the soup at  --  where  --  where ? Ilamish 's younger one must be about that size now . Let 's see  --  Munich  --  Coronation  --  Abdication crisis  --  death of the old King  --  before that  --  must be five exactly. 50 1 " How old is he ? " he said . The nursemaid looked up quickly . Hamish saw her summing up his age , his clothing , his fitness to be spoken to . " Just turned five , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Fine-looking little chap . " " Yes , sir . " She fingered her novelette politely . " Oh , go on and read . Do n't let me disturb you , " he said . " I must be getting along . " He got up and marched away sprucely , his cane swinging . Parks , he thought . Wonderful things . A spot of green in a city . You sat a moment , let your senses rest a moment , and there you were . He went along past the old filled-in trenches of the first scare . Two girls , gay with lipstick , flounced past  --  one carrying a bottle of milk . Their voices rose , chattering , high . Hamish swung his stick and marched erectly . This was like old days . London in the old days . Ah  --  no tin-pan whiningand pin-ball parlors and that un-British stuff on Oxford Street then . No boop-a-dooping and hot-cha-chaing . The songs they sang now  --  like the rote songs of savages . In the old days  --  there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord , how they sang that when they pulled out for Africa . Just to hum the first bar mentally flashed it all back  --  the rank smell of the Portsmouth mud flats and the odor of tar and the troopship pulling out . The old Victory lying there , and over in the harbor the sailors on a warship , standing in rows on the deck , their straw hats flashing in the sunshine , stamping their bare feet as they practiced in unison the cutlass drill . He could hear it now  --  the voice of the cutlass instructor coming harsh over the water , even over the sounds of the troops on the deck below , bellowing like mad : " Goodbye my Bluebell . Farewell to you . One last wild look into your eyes of blue . Mid camp-fires gleaming ; mid shot and shell ; I will be dreaming of my own  --  Blue  --  bell ! " Ah , days , days . And old songs ! " Under the Bamboo Tree ! " Gertie 's song . And as fresh as if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was more than you ever could of any of the things they sang today . Yet it was511ten  --  twenty  --  thirty  --  heavens alive , nearly forty years ago . Thirty-six or seven . Just about the time of the Russo-Jap do . That would be 1904 . Gertie was twenty-nine then . That made her sixty-five now . Good Lord , Gertie sixty-five . Gertie ! He looked up suddenly and saw a taxi by the Arch . He waved his stick impulsively . The cab circled over . " Do you know Millings Garden Lane ? " " Yes , sir . Off the Millings Road . " " That 's it . Number seven . Seven , Millings Garden Lane . " He settled back happily in the cab , gay with a sudden feeling of impetuousadventure . There was the faint odor of leather . His mind turned to hansom cabs . It was n't quite the same smell . Then there 'd been leather and the good lusty smell of horse sweat mixed in . Saddle soap too , somewhere . By God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it at that . Everyone shouted about the advancements of science ; but they had n't made the world any better . Suppose you were God  --  with a wipe of your hand you could knock all the jittering gadgets away  --  sweep the world back to the old days ? No motorcars , airplanes , wireless , cinemas , howling tin music in Oxford Street . Think of it ! Why , not even the veriest idiot would hesitate for a moment  --  wave the hand ! Wipe it out ! If you could only bring the old world back ! Suppose it ! Now at this moment , he 'd be able to hear the horse ahead of him clop-clopping on the pavement . There 'd be the sweet smell of sweat and leather in the warmth . The busses would he jogging along behind the old plugs . And the brewery lorries  --  with their teams of enormous shires ! Traps and dogcarts and smart coachmen and a tiger on the box  --  flowing gowns on the women walking under those plane trees  --  they 'd be holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture of reaching down and behind to clutch the skirt ankle-high as they stepped from the pavement . I low graceful that gesture had been  --  all womanhood , sex , everything , in that half-turn of the hips to reach for skirts , to hold ankle-high . Ankles ! What were ankles today ? Why , a man would be a howling maniac not to prefer that gentle , slow-paced old-time world to this madhouse . Of course , there was all this talk of social betterment today . Well  --  he was n't rabidly and foaminglyanti-Bolshevik as some men were . Dash it all , of course not . He52was as ready as the next to look at it as a liberal-minded man should . I tut , could you say the common people were better off ? Could you say their lives were any happier ? That was the test . Did they like living any more today than they had then ? No , honestly , you could n't say they were truly and fundamentally better off . Everyone was happier in the old days , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by God , not ashamed of their calling  --  proud of doing their jobs well . Happier and prouder . And what was progress if it could n't make people happier ? Making most of the people happier most of the time  --  that 's what civilization was , was n't it ? And all this science had n't done any good . It had only done harm . Look at wars today , for instance . Wars had been positively decent things in those days compared to today . They had  --  well , damn it  --  good form , in a way . You could mock and scoff at form all you wanted , but where was the scientific substitute for it ? Nowhere ! Ah , soldiering in the old days ! Tight breeches with the stripe down the leg , and clinking spurs riveted to your heels . The little pillbox hat , and the white stripe down your cheek where the sun had n't tanned under the chin-strap . Cavalry was cavalry , and the charge was still part of war . The charge at Omdurman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that any more . Of course , people got killed . They were n't opera-bouffe wars . Indeed not ! Chaps got killed just as dead then as now . But it seemed to haveIII. some sense . Yet  --  good chaps went . Carteras with the damned spear right through him  --  like the snout of a swordfish ! Right through him , and riding up and saying : " I never1111 saw him  --  I never saw him ! " And then toppling right out of the saddle . Fine chap . Six-three and a trojan on the polo field . Then  --  dead ! You could n't realize it . It was hard to realize even now that Carteras was n't alive . Any moment , you felt , he 'd poke his head into the tent and giveII that great horselaugh .

The driver pulled to the curb , and slid back the window . " Do we pass a pub on the way ? " " Why , yes , sir . There 's several . There 's the Tun and Wheel , and the Green Arms and . . . " " Any will do . Here . Take this pound note and get me a quart of sloe gin . " " A quart of sloe gin . Yes , sir . " The man took the note and ground the car into gear . When there was no answer Old Hamish pressed the sneck of the door and walked in . " Hi , " he called . " Hi there ! " He waited , the wrapped-up bottle of gin in his hand . There was no sound . Quietly he walked through the kitchen , which was curiously enough the front room . He went along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire glowed in the grate . Then he saw her , asleep , in the rocking chair that was beside a huge brass bed . 11cr great bulk filled the chair , pressing against the sides that alone seemed to prevent any overflowing . He saw crutches leaning against the fireside . As his eyes took this in , she wakened . She stared , her head half-turned . Terror came into her face until realization over- took it . She blinked . Her eyes were rheumy . " Gertie , " he said . " It 's all right . It 's me . " There was , for a brief second , no apperception in her face , and then the smile bloomed , going beautifully over her generous features . " The Captain , " she breathed . " Well , bless my soul if it is n't th Captain . " " ( ) f course it 's me , " he said , as if to a child . " Conic to see Gertie. " " ( ) f course ! And look ! I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She held out her hands and took the parcel . She nursed it without opening it . Then she shook her head . " Oooh , " she said , brightly . " I just dropped off in a nap . Pull up the chair . " He sat beside the hearth , and looked at the crutches . He looked bac  --  at her . Then he started . One of her legs was missing . 54 " My God , " he said . " What is it ? " " What ? " She followed his glance , and then she laughed . The merry , bubbling , heedless laughter that had always been her own flooded the small room . " I had it took off , " she said , proudly . She was fully awake now and bright with liveliness . " Took off ? " he said , vacantly . " Yes . It was me bad leg , y'know . It would n't get better , and always running sores . Nasty things , you know . Not nice , are they ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oooh , Captain , it got so 's I could n't bear myself . I always was one for being neat and clean  --  no matter what , you know I always was one for taking pride . And it got so 's I could n't bear myself . And we 'd tried this and that and everything else . So the doctor says : There 's only one thing . It 'll have to come off . ' Then off it comes , ' I says , just like that . " So off I pops into the hospital . And pop ! Off comes me leg , just like that . " " But  --  but why did n't you let me know ? " he said . " Oooh , I did n't want to bother anyone . I says to myself : It 's your own leg , and your own mind to make up . So have it off . ' And glad I am , too . No more sores , and nasty things they are , too  --  you would n't knowunless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice and neat . Only six weeks ago , it was , and I feel better already . Never felt better . " She laughed again , the rich , gurgling laugh that Hamish always remembered . " Outside one thing , " she said . She laughed again . " You 'll neverimagine . I want to scratch the sole of me foot  --  and it 's not there . imagine ! Me foot tickles  --  and I have n't got any foot ! " She laughed until the ripples spread down her body , and her plumpnessquivered all over . " I know , " he said , reprovingly . " But I 've always told you , in caseof anything , to let me know . Or to get in touch with Mr. Haskell immediately . Why did n't you ? " " Oooh , it was n't anything , Captain , once I 'd made up me mind . And they were that nice to me in hospital . The nurses were just lovely . They were so proud of me . You know , they swore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up so fast and so nicely as I did . iever ! " " Yes , " he said . " It 's just  --  just a bit of a shock . " 55 " I could n't help it , " she said , almost tearfully . She bent her head and then remembered the package in her hands . " It 's sloe gin , " he said . " Fancy you remembering , " she said quietly , without looking up . " Now , now , " he said . " I have n't been scolding . Would you like a drink ? " She looked up , and the sly glance came in her face . " Well , doctor says I should n't . But  --  there 's glasses in the cupboard . I ca n't get around very well yet . That 's why 1 had me bed brought down here . Would you mind ? " He got one glass and opened the bottle . The clear liquid gurgled . He shuddered at the smell . He held out the glass . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cheerio . " He settled comfortably in the chair . It was cozy here , he was thinking . " I ca n't get over your leg , Gertie , " he said . " Aaah , " she sighed . " Well , l ca n't complain . It did its part for a long time . Danced me along life  --  what life I 've had . A shame in a way . " " That 's what I mean . It 's hard to think of you  --  and think of you dancing  --  and  --  well , it must be hard on you . " " Oh , Lord love you , Captain , I ca n't complain . You ca n't be young forever . And I did dance while I was at it , did n't I ? I did dance . " She nodded and went on . " What I say is , you 've got to take life as you find it and make the rough go with the smooth . " She stared in the fire , and then gurgled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ? And my legs were something to look at then . " Old 1lamish did not realize that he was lifting his mustaches with the hack of his hand . " As fine a pair of legs as London ever saw , " he said . " You beat Gaby What's-her-name  --  the French woman . You heat her hollow . " " Why , thank you , Captain . What a nice thing to say . Well , if you ask me , you had a grand leg yourself . " " Oh , cone , now . " " Do n't be bashful . You did . In them tight trousers with the yellow stripe . Soldiers  --  they do n't wear them no more . More 's the pity , I say . Say what you care to , I always liked a man to have good legs . And you could see what a man was like them days . Now  --  well , it 's turned around , 56and you can see what a gel is like . Terrible , I think . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different with a gel in the profession , was n't it ? " " Oh , yes . " " And we always wore tights . Not half-naked like gels go round on the streets these days . You ca n't say we ever did n't wear tights  --  and it looked nicer , if you ask me . Decenter and looked nicer . " Hamish gazed at the fire and nodded . " Yes , " he said . " Women looked better . And they were better  --  no silly cinema diets then . By the Lord , some of those old principal boys had figures . You did , too . " " Did n't I just ! " She laughed and the sound came warm and almost sexual . Her old frame shook with merriment . " Oooh , dear . And did n't I dance . One and two and . . . and the cakewalk . Sossidge for tea . Remember ? And I Laka You Lak . . . " " I was just thinking of that today , " Hamish cut in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , it was my song , " she said , simply . He nodded , staring in the fire , and hummed the tune inside himself . It rolled the years back . She stared , lost in her own meanderings . Then she said : " Remember the parody we had on it . Remember , after Cissie sang it straight , then me and the whole chorus : I saw Bill BaileyKissing a ladyUnder the Bamboo tree . Bill Bailey ran away .. . She sang , her voice small and sweet and at strange odds with the jaunty doggerel . He looked up and watched her face , dimpling and shining over the white crocheted collar with its demure clasp pin . He jogged his mind sternly . It was no use sitting and talking of old times . He ought to be getting along . It had all ended so long ago  --  ' Gertie ! It was nice to see her settled in her old age . Old age ? She was four years younger than he . But of course , age for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I must be going , " he said , abruptly 57 ) She stopped humming . When she spoke her voice was small  --  like that of a forlorn child . " Will it be three years before you come and see me again ? " " Oh , no . I 'll drop past . I do n't often get down to London now , you know . " She brooded . " Please stop a while with Gertie . Look , have tea , it 's almost teatime . Please stay . " He stood , perplexed . It was so unusual . That had been the one thing about Gertie . She 'd never questioned or pleaded or demanded his time back in the days when  --  when they were younger . Gertie had shown perfect understanding . But now  --  crippled , of course . It must make life lonesome for her . " Look here , " he said , briskly . " IIow do you manage now ? I think you ought to have a servant  --  a maid or a good dependable woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get along so nicely . The little gel from next door comes in . She 's such a lovely little thing . She 'll be in from school most any time and get us tea . If you 'd wait a minute . .. " " I must go , Gertie . But I 'll look in again . And if there 's anything . . . " IIe heard the door slam and the sound of a child 's voice , calling . " That 's Alice now ! " Gertie said . He turned and saw the child come rushing into the room . " Oh , Mrs. Tindley . I saw . . . " Hamish watched the child halt in mid-speech as she saw him . He smiled . " What did you see ? " he asked . " The doctor 's motorcar humped a tram , " she said , flatly . She edged quietly to Gertie 's side . ( ; ertic put a plump arm around her . his mind pondered on the " Al rs . " Of course , Gertie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had never thought of it . " This is Alice , " Gertie was saying , proudly . " She does for me , do n't you , dear ? I ) ocs my bed and makes my tea and everything . " I-Iamish saw the child leaning half-shyly against Gertie 's shoulder . The girl 's hair seemed tarnished red in the firelight , and her face , pale above the brown velvet of her dress , seemed brightly intelligent . She was about fourteen  --  just passing from thin coltishness into the first58blossom of nubility . He saw her breasts pushing like fast-growing plants , it the flatness of the velvet . He flicked his eyes away . " Awkward , " he thought , " the way one 's eyes wander . Hardly quite decent , looking at a child . " Ile saw that her eyes were fixed on the gold top of his cane . " Say how-de-do to the Captain , Alice . " " How-de-do , " the child said . She put one foot behind the other and plucked the sides of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled . A pleasant child  --  and well-brought up . That was the proper way . So few children today had the slightest notion of how to behave . Drop curtsies and what not . Ile felt suddenly pleased . " How do you do , " he said . The child looked up at Gertie . " Shall I get your tea ? " " Well , now , " Gertie said . " We 're just trying to get the Captain to stay . Perhaps if we asked nicely . . . " " Oh , I might as well stay now , " Hamish said . " I could do with a spot of tea . " " There , " Gertie said , happily . " Now let 's give the Captain a real high tea . We 'll get something nice at the shop . Just reach me my purse . . . " " Here , here ! " Hamish protested . He dropped his gloves in his hat and set the cane by the wall . He got a pound note from the folder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl . " Now you get lots of nice things , " he said . " Lots of them . " " What shall I get ? " " Oh  --  what you like . " " You just get what you think would be nice for us , dear , " Gertiesaid . " Now you show us how nice you can think up things for tea . " The girl stared at the note in her open hand a moment , then claspedit with a convulsive movement , and ran from the room eagerly . I-Iamish and Gertie laughed . " A nice girl , " he said . " Very nice child . Yes . " IIe settled himself in the chair and stared at the fire . Gertie seemed lost in her thoughts . His mind ambled drowsily . There was a peace here , sitting in this tiny room , the fire glowing warmly . More than that  --  a sort of ease of mind . An ease  --  where one 59 lcould talk naturally of bad legs  --  and old songs . No artificiality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls . He heard Gertie laughing . " Oooh , will you ever forget the time I did the dance on the table that New Year 's  --  and that Leftenant Cary-Ford ? " " Yes . " " Ah , now , now . You was always jealous of him . And no reason to be . Because there never was a man you had reason to be jealous of or suspicious of . That 's one thing I can always say . Never ! Excepting that one particular case , and you-know-who , whose name we wo n't mention . And we wo n't speak any more about it . But outside of that , you never had reason to be jealous . " " Why ? " he said , suddenly . " Why did you play straight ? " She wrinkled her forehead . " I do n't know , " she said . " It 's just I have respect for myself , that 's all . When a gentleman takes a girl , and does proper by her , why I 'd think shame on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see . " He nodded to the fire . " Whatever become of that Leftenant Cary-Ford ? " she asked . Then she chuckled . " Oooh , he was a one , that chap . A devil if I ever saw one . Laugh ! I never saw a chap so full of deviltry  --  like pouring the champagnein that poor cabby 's hat . I often wondered what he does now ? " " Cary-Ford ? " he said . " He got killed . He was a brigadier-general . Got it in March , ' 18 . " " He did ? Oh , now , is n't that a pity ! Such a nice young chap he was  --  and never a one any fuller of fun than he was . Oh , dear , the war . And now we 've got another one . " " Yes , " he said . " And it 's a had one . " " Those nasty ( ; ernmans , " she said . " We beat them once and now we have to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right . I have a wireless , you know , and I listen sometimes . The li.13.C. sounds very hopeful . Ilut to tell you the truth , I do n't listen very much . " " Why not ? " " 1 do n't know . I ca n't take this one very seriously , in a manner of speaking . I suppose it 's  --  you know  --  getting . along in years . Wars are for young people . When you get along , you ca n't take ' em seriously . You get thinking : I may have passed on before it 's all over , and then I 'll never know how it came out . You could n't get interested in a play at 6o the theater if you kept thinking you were only going to see the first stet. " 1 le shook his head . Then turned . " Do you mind getting along , Gertie ? Does it worry you ? " " Mc ? " Her laugh pealed brightly . " Lord love you , no . When you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further you get along , the friendlier it seems . Of course , I like to think of what jolly times we had when we were young  --  and I would n't want my life much different . But I would n't want it to be like that now . Oh , no . All that helterskelter , and troubles and carryings-on . They 're nice when you 're young . But now  --  I like peace . Just sitting here , I 'm comfortable . " Ile nodded . " Yes , " he said . " I understand . It 's very comforting here . " Ile rocked and the room was silent except for the spitting of the fire and the ticking of the cheap clock . He poked the fire , and then lifted a few more pieces of coal on it from the scuttle , setting them neatly with the tongs . He felt somehow that this had included him into the home  --  as if it now possessed part of him that had been his own before . He sat back and rocked time away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , they heard the sound of Alice returning . Hamish sat up and looked round . They heard her dropping bundles in the kitchen , and coming down the hall . She came in , smiling happily . " Your change , " she said , quietly . She tumbled the coins into Hamish 's hand . They were warm from the tight clutch of her palm . As she turned , he called her back . " Here , here ! " he said . He looked among the coins and found a half-crown . " There you are , my girl , " he said . She came forward , shyly , and took the coin . Again she dropped her shy curtsy . He saw her looking at him from under her eyelashes in that second . Then she turned and went as if for protection to Gertie . She opened the palm and showed the coin . " That 's a very good girl , " Hamish said . Gertie stroked the child 's hair fondly . " But you should say thank you , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curtsy . " " That 's all right , " Hamish said , brightly . " She has very nice manners . " " She has , " Gertie said , comfortingly , still stroking the child 's hair . 6z t " Always watch your manners , and be polite , and keep yourself neat and clean  --  and watch your figure . And then  --  some day Her voice lifted dreamily as if she were telling a fairy tale . " . .. Some day  --  you 'll have a nice gentleman to call on you for tea , too . " Gertie laughed , throatily . Hamish saw again , in a second , the child 's glance come up warm and almost maturely and sexually alive from under her long lashes . He felt that the child must have known it , too , for she ran quickly back to the kitchen . Hamish avoided Gertie 's glance as he turned back to the fire . It was comfortable , Hamish thought , that was why he had stayed on . What more could a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get tired of it  --  humble living  --  this tiny room . Die of claustrophobia . Get to hate the warm , lived-in smell . But  --  just at this moment of this year of his life , in the city of London  --  it seemed very comfortable. 62CHAPTER VIIITHE pub already was well into the full chorus of evening gabble that would go on until closing time . The low-ceilinged place seemed as if it had been poured full of sound , and one only preserved a small private sanctuary in it a few inches round his own body . Clive swilled the beer round in his mug and stared at the table . Joe made a movement with his hand , and he looked up . Joe held up a finger . At the same time , the hubbub died and the B.B.C. voice came clearly from the wireless . The B.B.C. was announcing that bombs had been dropped on the Southeast coast . The R.A.F. , however , were shooting down daylight raiders whenever they came over . The army in Somaliland was retiring . Clive and Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When it was over the pub broke into its hubbub like horses starting from the tape . Clive looked toward the door . " D'ye think we 'll beat ' em , Briggs ? " Clive started , and then looked soberly at Joe . He looked carefully , as if seeing for the first time  --  or for the last  --  the form and shape of him : the wave of carefully combed hair under the jauntily set-back cap ; the regular , good-humored features  --  small nose , calm eyes , large firm mouth . It was a good-natured , slightly flamboyant , very British face . " No , " he said . " I do n't think we will . " Joe looked up quickly , and then drew patterns in the wet table top with his finger . " Why not ? Look at the last war . It looked as bad at times . " " Last war everyone rounded on Germany , Joe . War nowadays is like a gang fight , Joe . A bunch all scrapping  --  and they end up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like wolves  --  eating the bloodiest . Last time it was Germany . This time it 'll be Britain . " " But if the United States comes in . . . " " She wo n't . That 's bad hopeful thinking . She wo n't fight with and for us . None of them will . They 'll all round on us now . We 're the fattest picking . There 's plenty of plunder for all of them . All the nations of the earth can watch us go down , and there 'll be swag enough to make them all happy when we 're done . " " We 're not going to be done , " Joe said , angrily . " Why not ? " " Well , we 're not . " " Well , let 's not argue . " Clive rose and looked toward the door . " Wait a minute , chum . I wanted to tell you . I 'm going . " " Going ? Where ? Joining up ? " " Sort of . A minesweeper . Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told you about  --  well , he 's going , and he asked me to go along with him . " Clive sat and regarded the table . " I see , " he said . " Well , I can wish you luck . If that 's your line , and you 're set to go , that 's the thing to do . " " That 's the way I looked at it , " Joe said , happily . " Might as well go for what I know and not wait till they come along and pull me into khaki and set me doing something I do n't know . " " That 's right . A chap 's got to do what he thinks best . But I 'll be missingyou . When do you go ? " " Well , that 's it . I go down tomorrow . And  --  you know you can take this all right from me ? " " ( ) f course . What ? " " Well , I thought -- how about you coming with me ? I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chum . And he says , well , the more the merrier . Now you do n't have to say anything if you do n't want . " Clive looked at the table . Suddenly the noise came into his consciousnessagain , crowding at him . He wanted to be away  --  outside . He drew circles with his finger . " I I I say no , Joe , will you understand ? " " Of course , chum . Of course . This is a free country . " " No , you do n't see it right . " " But I do . " 64 " No , you do n't . I can tell the way you say it . " " No . A man 's business is his own . I just thought , like , I 'd ask you . There 's no harm asking . " " No . That 's right . I think  --  I ' 11 step along , Joe . " " Hold on , Briggs . There 's something else , like . Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything to get my old lady in a jam . " Clive sat down again . He looked up at Joe 's troubled face . " What do you think I am ? " he said . " I 'll pack up and move on . " " No , that 's it , " Joe said . " I 'd like for you to stay  --  as long as you want . It 's a man about . You know what I mean  --  just having someone around once in a while , then it ai n't so lonesome for my old lady . And  --  after all , renting the room to you does help . Every little bit helps they say , and there 's something to it , is n't there ? But the only thing is . .. " " What ? " " Oh , Jesus Christ . I hate a Nosey Parker , and it 's none of my business , but there 's the old lady . But  --  are you a secret service chap ? " Clive looked at Joe 's solemn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " No . " " Well , I do n't give a bugger what you are , chum . Or what you 're up to . If you say it 's all right , and does n't make trouble for my old lady . " " You 're a good chap , Joe . " " Oh , hell . It is n't that . Are you  --  are you in trouble , mate ? " Clive studied the young man before him . " It 's all right . Nothing 's wrong . You 've treated me well , Joe . So I 'll tell you . I 'm  --  I 'm a soldier . " Joe nodded . " That explains those military ration tickets you gave my old lady . But  --  but why did n't you say you was in the service ? " " Look , Joe , I ca n't explain . It 'd take too long . But I promise you it 's all right . I 'm on leave . It 'll be up soon . A few more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right ? " " I want you to stay as long as you feel like it , " Joe said . " You say it 's all right  --  I believe you . It 's all right . " Clive smiled . " All right , Joe . Now let 's have a drink on it . " " Yes , " Joe said . " Just one  --  then I 'm off . This 'll be last night home , you know . And I think I 'll spend my last night home . You know how women are . My old lady would like it . " 65 " Yes , " Clive said . " That 's the best thing to do . " He went and got the beers . He handed the mug to Joe . " Here 's to the war , " Joe said . " It 's the best bloody one we 've got . " Clive lifted his mug . " And here 's to . .. " " To what ? " " To you , " Clive said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us  --  and to  --  not to the war . To the end of it . To peace ! " " Right . To me and you and all of us and the war and the end of it . Drink up ! " They drank and left the inn . Then they were in the dusk , going through the village with quick step and senses somehow newly tuned to unlightedevenings . At Joe 's street they parted . " I 'll take a stroll , " Clive said . " Then your mother will have you alone . " " Do you think she 'd like it that way , now ? " " I feel sure of it . " They left each other and Clive went on in the dimness , his feet striking the metaled road regularly . It was not until he was almost there that he realized he was by the tree overhanging the wall . He paused in indecision , and then sat on the wall . Detached , in the darkness , from time to time he heard the low voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a quick , uplifted laugh , and sometimes the lower note of a man 's voice . Then he heard a voice that he remembered . " Violet ? " He went into the road . " I was with Joe Tolson  --  at the concert Saturday night . " " Oh , it 's you , " she said . " This is my friend , Miss Patsy Acton . Mr.  --  I forgot your name . " " Briggs , " ( ' live said . he ducked his head at a mass in the blackness which , obviously , was another girl . l le heard her voice , metallic in the London way . " It 's really an enormous pleasure to meet you . " She gabbled the syllables as if it were a well-loved phrase . " Thanks , " Clive said . " Look , Violet . You 're heading back to camp , are n't you ? " " Well , I was . " " Do something for me , there 's a good pal . Tell Prudence I 'm here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was with Saturday . Ask her if she can come . " " Well , now . I do n't know . I can ask her . I do n't know whether or not she 'll come . She 's funny . " " That 's all right . Just ask her . " " Well , I will  --  seeing it 's you . But she 's  --  awful uppy . " He heard the girls go away . He went back to the wall and sat , wishingthe time away , listening as girls passed . At last there were the footstepsof one person , coming toward the tree . He jumped to his feet . " Prudence ! " " No . This is Patsy . " " Patsy ? " " Yes . Patsy Acton . Violet just performed the introduction . " " Oh , yes . What did she say ? " " Prudence ? She said she could n't come . She said to say she was most dreadfully sorry , but she was indisposed with a headache . She says it 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Violet . Then Violet would n't come . She 's terrible lazy , is Violet . So I come all alone . I would n't have you standing out here all alone . It is n't fair to leave anyonejust standing , like that , is it ? So I come  --  all alone . I would n't come down here all alone , only I could n't bear to think . .. " " Thank you , " Clive said . He felt the girl waiting . There was a sense of her nearness . " All right , " he said . " It does n't matter . Will you do something else for me ? " " With extreme pleasure  --  if I can . " " Tell Prudence  --  tell her I 'll be here tomorrow night . I 'll wait here until she comes  --  if she can . I 'd like her to meet me . Tell her that , would you , please ? " The girl yawned , loudly . " Well , I can tell her . I do n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Prudence is . " " She 's what ? " " Swagnay . It 's French . Well , I 'll go all the way back . And alone . " He heard her footsteps drag away . He went back to the wall and sat . A ripening moon came up , and cast faint shadows . There was nothing he desired now so much as to see Prudence . Not being able to see her made it an intense longing. 67CHAPTER IXTHE next night it was raining dismally , and he did not expect her to come . But he heard her feet squelching on the road , and heard the rustle of her mackintosh and the slap of rain on the hard fabric . Then he felt her beside him . He jumped down and they stood , awkwardly and without ease . " Nice of you to come , " he said . " I would n't have blamed you if . " Ghastly weather , " she said . " Fearful . Certainly is n't romantic . " " See here , I should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just said I would n't have blamed you if you did n't . " " Not the weather . Just coming at all . Oh  --  I suppose it 's the feminine thing to say . You must n't mind if I say useless things , will you ? You wo n't mind , ever ? " " Go on and be feminine , " he said . " I did n't mean to be rude . " " No , you 're all right . " She stood , waiting . " Shall we be comfortable  --  as comfortable as we can ? " They sat on the low wall . The rain slatted and the night was close about them , shutting them in a sort of privacy . " I suppose there 's not much help for these things , " she said , slowly . " What things ? " " You know . Do n't crumble the defenses of my phrases . " He did not answer . " Tell me about you , " she said. 68 " No . You tell me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean in ordinary life . " " There 's almost nothing to tell about me , I 'm afraid . " " Now you are speaking phrases . Everyone does something . Everyone'slife is full and important and dramatic  --  to himself at the very least . " " That 's so . I studied art . " " Art ? What for ? " " You know , that 's what I wonder now . I was n't very good at it , really . It 's what you do  --  study art  --  it 's done . You wander round and wonder what you can do . You do n't like bridge , and you do n't like doing nothing , and  --  and you 're not the athletic type . So what can you do ? You can get a job reading for a publisher through a friend  --  or start a hat shop with a woman who 's having trouble with her husband  --  or take up social service work  --  or dedicate your life to having direr illnessesthan any of the others you know  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a career  --  art . " " And now you 're in the Waifs . " " Yes , and now I 'm in the Waifs , sitting on a wall with a strange man  --  and in idiotic weather . " She spoke the last as a sweep of wind shook the beech tree , sending the gathered rain down in a torrent on their hunched shoulders . " It is idiotic of me to keep you here , " he said . " I 'll take you back , eh ? " " We were going to talk about you . " " I 'll tell you some other time . " " Yes , " she said , slowly . " You shall tell me . " She got down from the wall and they walked along , slowly , in the pelting rain . Their feet dragged as if they wished it to last , this going along the road close together , with the storm making the world lonesome . " You must leave me here , " she said , finally . " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " That is n't it . I do n't care . " " It is it , and of course you care . " " Yes , " she said . " I do care , in a way . You have to get used to things . " They stood waiting . " Will you see me again , Prudence ? " " Why do you want to see me again ? " " Shall we complicate things by trying to express reasons ? " 69 " It 's easier not to , I suppose . But we go through moves of defense  --  i like a chess game  --  doing it all by instinct . We do it , even when weknow there 's no defense there . It ca n't be born in us . It 's instilled in us from the time we 're little girls . " " Then you 'll meet me  --  not under the tree . Ca n't I see you sometime  --  do n't you have time off ? " She paused , and then said : " I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , brightly . " What would madame like to do ? " " What do you suggest , sir ? " " Far be it from me to be suggestive , madame . " " You do have a sense of humor , do n't you ? " " Oh , a very strong one , when it 's unbridled . But also I 've got atenacious mind . I still want to know what-where-when about tomorrow . Where do we go ? " " You think it up . " " I 'm a stranger here myself , madame . I do n't know the ways of the land . " " Well  --  I ' 11 meet you at two . That 's the regular camp routine . Meet you by the bus stop at two . " " Then what 's the routine ? " " You ride up to Wythe and you have tea , and then you go to the cinema , and then you come back on the last bus and tell everyone what a fine time you had . That 's supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , far be it from me to upset ordained schedules in these regimentedtimes . I 'll see you at two , then , at the Gosley bus stop . " " No , the high road one  --  it does n't matter . I 'll get on at the high road , and you can get on at Gosley . It will save a walk . Or  --  no . Please come to the high road and meet me there and we 'll get on together . " " That was nice of you , " he said . " Good night . " He stood , listening to her go away . Only when he turned about didhe become conscious of how wet he was . His shoes squelched with the water . " It has a High Street , a Main Street , one cinema and a war memorial , " she said . He walked with his eyes ahead . " And six pubs , one Wythe Community Center and one hotel . " 70They walked in the sunlight . Now , because they could see each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not very bright , are we ? " she said . He knew what she meant . " Perhaps I 'd better take you back . " She drew in her breath and walked without answering . Then shesaid : " It has a nice church and a very pretty graveyard . " He went with his eyes on the pavement . " It 's a very pretty graveyard , " she said . Her voice sounded small . He stopped impulsively , and looked at herface . Then he smiled . " Is it very pretty ? " " Very , very pretty , " she said . He thought she was going to cry . " Well , if it 's very , very pretty  --  that makes it different , " he said . He looked about him . " Every teashop looked grimier than the last , " he said . " But even ifthis one is full of flies and corruption , it 'll have to do . Wait here . " She stood in the sunlight , watching him go across the cobbled street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and felt mutually repelled . She shut her eyes , and counted , childishly . At every ten she opened her eyes . She did that until , at the fifth count to ten , when she opened her eyes , he was coming back carrying paper bags . " Rations ready , " he said . " Was it full of flies ? " " Every kind . House , horse and bluebottle . Now  --  where 's this very , very pretty graveyard ? " " This way . " They went along the road from town , past the last shops and a fewhouses of the suburbia inclination . The lane curved , and there , beneath the wineglass-shaped elms , the church was . The flat-topped wall , the stone green with age , fronted the stone-flagged pavement . " Now , is n't it nice ? " " Yes , " he said , quietly . " It is . " She put a hand on the wall and jumped up quickly , turning so that shesat . He put the parcels on the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her face . He smiled and kept looking at her . Now , at last , he was looking frankly at her , there was no more self-consciousness. 711He looked at her eyes . They were a fine gray-blue . Her hair , so light that it was almost silvery in texture , was drawn back tightly beneath her cap . Her skin was a blue-white color . Her mouth was somehow square and pugnacious . There were hints of freckles on the nose . She was much prettier than he had imagined . Pretty ? She was quite beautiful . Certainly one would never dare hope , meeting a girl at randomin the darkness , to have any better luck . He was lucky ! " Well , " she said , happily . He knew then that she must have seen gladness in his face . " So you 're the girl I met in the dark , " he said . " Well , what did you expect me to look like ? " " You look exactly like I imagined you . " " You liar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a mole on my nose . " " I did not . I knew you had no moles . " " Well , I have . " " Where ? " " I ca n't show you . " He laughed quickly . " When you went home last night , " she went on , " you suddenly realized that you did n't know what I looked like . And then you drew in your breath , and said : My God ! She might look like a pan of sour milk . ' " " By God , " he said , " I did . How did you know that ? " She put her hands between her knees and leaned back , laughing . " Because , " she said , " I did the same thing . " " Oh , " he said , a little ruefully . " I suppose that is so . Well . What did you expect me to be like ? " " Exactly as you arc , sir . " " No . Truthfully . " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as handsome as you are . " " Oh , conic . " " You are handsome  --  a nice sort of face  --  the nose a little too fine and the mouth a little on the large side . One of your ears sticks out a little more than the other  --  you know your face is quite lopsided ? I can see it now . " " That 's enough . " " No . And your eyes are very nice . A good , deep brown . They 're a721little tired-looking  --  too late hours , that is . But your eyes are your best feature . Yes , I should say that . Rather tender eyes you have . . . " " Tender ? " " And on the whole , it 's quite a good face . The lean type . A little too lean , but I 'm glad you 're not fat-faced . I hate soggy faces , do n't you ? " He looked up into her face , without answering . " Go on , " he said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're vain  --  you want me to go on talking about you . All men are vain . " He whistled . " What a remarkable generalization . " " And you should n't wrinkle your forehead so much , " she said . " It 's a bad habit . Now that 's all . " He jumped up on the wall beside her and opened the parcels . " Ham sandwiches , " he said , " guaranteed to taste like damp cardboard . Rock buns  --  very rocky . And  --  milk ! " " Very nice , sir . " She took a sandwich and a bottle of milk . He watched her as she ate , her uniformed figure trim . He looked down at her leg , swinging  --  then he watched her low-heeled shoe . When she turned he looked up . She smiled and looked away again . " Nice , " she said . " We seem to be fated for walls . But it 's always nice  --  away from people . " He nodded and laughed , but did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up at her face . He thought : She is quite beautiful . " It 's all funny , " he said . " Us . Sitting here . Wondering about each other . Like people newly met . Now we can see each other in daylight  --  partly shy , partly ill at ease , partly curious . Wondering about everything that happened before we met  --  and everything that happened after . Wondering about our lives , stretching back with no knoweldge of each other , somehow winding tortuously right up to this point where we , two people , should sit on this wall , all full of curiosities and suspicionsand defenses . " " Not suspicions , " she said . " Yes . Suspicions , too . Not so much of each other as at circumstance  --  touching the tentacles of relationship gladly one second , drawing back 73 lquickly the next for fear of possession  --  suspecting that and suspecting captivity . " " Captivity ! My goodness . You must n't think I want to capture you . " " We all do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avidly . " He swung about on the wall and stared at a gravestone . " Do n't worry about it , " he said . " Listen to this one . Jonathan Stanginghornof the Parish of Wythe. 1739-1818 . Look on me as ye pass by ; as ye are now so once was I. As I am now so ye shall be . Prepare for God and Eternity . ' Cheerful blighter , was n't he ? " " Ghoulish , " she said . She swung her legs over the wall so that she sat facing the stone with him . He felt curiously pleased that she handled skirts so expertly and neatly . Some women were so clumsy . .. . " But they liked it that way , I suppose , " she said . " They believed in the hereafter and were quite happy about facing it . Made it all very nice for them . " He looked at her , hearing the clarity of her voice . He put his hand on hers . " You 're very nice , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took his hand away angrily . " I 'm not starting anything . I was just saying you 're nice , that 's all . It was a natural thing to say  --  since I really have n't seen you before . " " What you 're trying to say is that I was quite a lucky packet to pickout of the blackout . " " Why do you suddenly talk bitterly like that ? " " Well , I am a lucky packet . And you . You 're . . . " " It seems to me we 've been through this conversation before . " " I know , but it 's hard to talk . I was going to say you were handsome , so do n't get angry . I could n't say that though , because it would sound unmaidenly . You would n't like to have me unmaidenly , would you ? " " I think you 're very nice unmaidenly . You ca n't be a maid any more . " " That 's true . Neither maid , wife , nor widow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the wall . " It 's all right , " she said . " I 'm one of the Waifs that a soldier took out in the dark . If it 's like that there 's some honesty somewhere in it , so it 's all right to leave it like that . " 74l " It is n't much use talking about it one way or another , if that 's what you mean . " " That 's what I mean , " she said . He turned , facing the road . They swung their legs . A bus went by , its engine pinging badly . He shuddered at the sound , and crumpled the paper bags . Then he halted , his arm upraised . At last he put the paper in his pocket . She looked at him and smiled . " Ca n't strew things around  --  by a very pretty graveyard , can I ? " " No , " she agreed . She touched his knee with her hand . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined up ? " He sat up , hugging his knee . " Rotif era , " he said . " For goodness ' sake . What 's that ? " " Bugs . " " Horrid word . Like bedbugs ? " " Much nicer . You 've heard of photomicrography ? " " Emphatically not . " " That 's good , because there 's photomicrography , and microphotography  --  which are entirely different things . Now you know all you need to about both , so worry no more about it , and we 'll continue up the Ganges to this tiny dot . Well , that 's a wonderful beggar named a rotifer . He 's a cheerful chap who lives in the marvelously beautiful jungle of slimy water , in which he goes around by turning himself into a paddle wheel . He 's the only animal in the world that uses the wheel as part of his body instead of using fins or legs or wings . " " You 're not kidding ? " " S'welp me , it 's true . He invented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " And what do you do about it ? " " I do n't do much . I got a job with an old chap who cuts them up and mounts them on slides . He 's a wonderful old chap . The only man in the world who has dissected rotifers properly . But he 's after something more important now . " " They 're tiny , then . " " Very minute . " " Did you always do that ? How did you start ? " " Oh  --  well , once I was in a secondhand camera repair shop . That 's how I picked up the photography part . I 'm handy at picking things up  --  machinery , you know . " 75 " Did you study it ? " " No . Just sort of came naturally  --  through a long series of fortuitous industrial wanderings . Once I was a dog dietitian . " " No . " " Yes . " " What does a dog dietitian do ? " " Well , it sounds fine . Mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready-made meals for dogs  --  chock full of vitamins and stuff , and balanced . We deliver to your door daily . No trouble to you . Have our dog dietitian bring freshly prepared meals of highest qualityingredients for your pet every day . You know  --  people too thickheadedor lazy to look after their own pets . " " No . " " It 's true . Most everyone in cities nowadays is too busy to look after a dog . So it 's a mass business . Chopped liver and meal and stuff , all prepared in a dainty frilled paper dish . It 's quite a business . You ask anyone in the dog game . " " How on earth did you get into such a business ? " " I could repair the truck . I told you  --  I 'm quite handy with machines . " " But what a curious business . " " That 's nothing . Once I was a canary whistler . " She laughed . " You 're fooling . What 's a canary whistler ? " " Chap who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how to whistle . It 's  --  it 's nature . " " Says you . I take my oath on it . You think canaries sing naturally , well , they do n't . Good ones  --  they have to be taught . They can learn from older birds , or from a canary whistler , or from a machine . " " Oh , come . What machine ? " " A trilling machine . It has compressed air and a water pipe , and it goes on rolling and trilling all clay . That 's how I got the job . I fixed the chap 's machine , and then I stayed on  --  feeding , you know , and cleaning and caging for market . I stuck at my post and progressed upward to special whistler for fine birds . Listen . " He put a finger on his lower lip , and the sound of a canary trilling , higher and higher , rolled out over the quietness of the afternoon . " Good heavens , " she said . " How do you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he grinned . " And it takes years of practice . " 76 J " You 're talented ! " " That 's nothing . Wait till you see me tap dance . " " Do n't tell me you 've been an actor . I could n't stand it . " " Lady , I have my code of decency , strange as it may be . I never fell that low , but I worked in an agency once  --  you know , that hires actors . " " And you 've worked with bugs and dogfood . " " Yes , ma'am . " " And canaries . " " And canaries . Lady , you believe me I worked with canaries . Why , if I ever see another canary  --  or hear one  --  or smell one , I 'll be sick . Bloody canaries ! " " Well , what did you do it for , then ? " " What did I do it for ? Hark to her ! Lady , I did it to eat . You know eating ?  --  meals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit of wanting some two  --  and very often even three  --  times a day . Hence the checkered career of employment . " " It has been checkered , I 'd say . " " Oh , but you have n't heard anything yet . " " Do n't tell me you 've had other exploits . " " Oh , dozens . Garage repairman , safety-glass demonstrator , padlock inspector . . . " " Padlock inspector ! You go around inspecting padlocks at night ? " " No . In a factory . A lock factory . " " How do you inspect a padlock ? Give a demonstration . You look in the keyhole ? " " No . You have a tray of padlocks . You take a rawhide mallet . You tap the first padlock in its most ticklish spot . Voila , the hasp flies open ! What does that mean ? " " The lock 's no good . " " No ! That means it 's perfect . If you ca n't rap it open , it 's faulty and you reject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Lady , my job was n't to ask questions . It was to rap padlocks on piecework . They said : Hit ' em here ! ' So I hit ' em and did n't worry about the causes  --  only the results . Like the old chap who hits the train axles with a hammer at the railway stations . He 'd been tapping ' em for sixty years and was retired on pension , and they gave him a gold button for his lapel , and shook his hand at a farewell dinner . And he77lsaid it was nice of them , after all those years , but one thing  --  he always wished someone had told him what the hell he was rapping the axles for . " " No . But what do they rap ' em for ? " He glanced up at her . " You can tell by sound whether a wheel 's true or not , or has a crack in it , ca n't you ? Test by resonance . " He held his knee with his clasped hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the endless quality of summer evening . The smell of sweetly new dust was in the air , and he heard a thrush singing in the close of the churchyard  --  saying that the twilight was coming at last . She wrinkled her nose in thought . " But you mean you can take a rawhide mallet and go around tapping padlocks and make them fly open without a key ? " " Most common types will . " " Are n't you a dangerous man to be loose ? " " I 'm saving the talent for special occasions . " " And you do n't know what makes it happen ? " " Of course I do  --  but it would take too long to explain . I 'd have to explain all about spring locks , and lever tumbler locks , and pin tumbler locks . Would you like a comprehensive dissertation ? " " We 'll save it for our old age . Tell me more about you . What else have you done ? " " Lots of things  --  anything that was a living . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not educated , lady . " " But you must be  --  you are ! " " I 'm not . I 'm half-educated  --  like ninety per cent of the people in this country . I know a little more than nothing about a little less than everything . " " But what do you intend to be ? " " Just myself . That 's all . It 's all I can be . You see , it is n't a case of what you want to be . It 's a case of what job a chap can get to make a living , is n't it ? You cone from a fairly well-off family , do n't you ? " " It 's all right . What would you be  --  if you could choose ? " " An undertaker , lady . " " No , seriously . " " I still say an undertaker . It 's the only business never has any slack times . " 78 " No , please tell me . Seriously . " " What 's the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thinking things like that with all this  --  this mess going on ? " She looked down at her feet . " How much time have you got left ? " she said . " You know  --  leave ? " " Do n't let 's talk about it . I hate to count it . " She looked up at him , and their glances were held for a moment . She put her hand to her throat , and then jumped from the wall . She spoke quickly . " Should n't we go ? " she said . " It 's getting on . If we want to go ti , the cinema . .. " He looked straight ahead . " Do you want to go to the cinema ? " " It 's customary , " she said . " Is n't that what we came for ? " " I asked if you wanted to go ? " " What else ? What do you want to do , then ? " He did not answer . " All right , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Good God , " he said . " A martyr . No thanks . " " Well , is n't that what you want ? " " Do you have to talk about it like that ? " " How do you expect me to talk about it ? That 's what you mean , is n't it ? " He got down from the wall and held her arm . Then he lifted his head . " It 's all right , " he said . " There 's a hundred reasons  --  you 're afraid , and upset , and muddled . You should be . It 's all right . Let 's go to thecinema . " He lifted her arm over his and started back toward the town . For a while they went in silence . Then she said : " Will you do something for me ? " " Anything you wish . " " I do n't mind , but haystacks , they ... " " Sound a little sordid . " " I did n't say that . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't mean it . I mean , talking about it seems a little so . It is n't really itself  --  when we 're there . It 's just  --  planning it . " " So , we go to the cinema . " " No . Will you  --  take me to the hotel ? " 79 " Then it wo n't be so sordid ? " " I did n't use that word , " she said . " You did . " " I 'm helping your thoughts out , that 's all . Now we 'll go to the cinema if you wish . " She stopped and clenched her fists . " You 're exactly like a woman , " she said . " Now will you please decide on something definite and let 's not argue . I say , clearly and distinctly , we 'll go to the hotel . " He stood a moment , then clasped her hand . " Forgive me , " he said . " You 're a little honester and braver than I am . " Arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , and to the Wythe Hotel with its remodeled front , done in pseudo half-timbered style . It was the fake aged fronting set out hopefully to catch the summer tourist trade that now seemed nonexistent . There were no people in the chairs set about the front room . Behind the desk a girl about sixteen sat reading , her toffee-colored hair hanging wispily down toward the magazine . She looked up like a suddenly alarmed animal . " I want a room  --  for my wife and myself , " Clive said . " Have you a double room ? " " That we ' ave , " she said . She jumped down from the stool and ran toward the back . She called down the three stairs . " Pa ! Pa ! There 's a lady and gent wants a double ! " She clarioned it , gladly , excitedly . Clive and Prue , standing there , felt suddenly naked and as if hundreds of people were watching them . They saw the little man come up the steps , wiping his mustache with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They saw , too , the professional smile of welcome on his face drop away as he looked at Prue and saw her uniform . " What you want ? " he said . " My wife and I  --  I 've come down to visit her . We 'd like accommoda-tions . " " You ' ave luggage ? " " I 'm sorry , we did n't have time . .. " " We do n't ' ave no room . " " But the girl said ... " " I do n't care what she said . I said , we do n't ' ave no room . We do n't operate that sort of plyce ! " 80The little man began to bristle with his own self-righteousness . His voice became more sharply accented . " D'y'understand ? We hoperyte a decent plyce ' ere and ... " " But dirty , " Clive said . Prue began to tug Clive 's arm , but he shook her away . " Now look ' ere , " the little man said . " Look ' ere ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Clive began . " I do n't give a bugger if y'ave . " . And if he were here , he 'd put it all neatly . He 'd tell you your place is dirty . You 're filthy too . Both you and your place smell . If you 'd go in and scrub some of the grime off yourself . . . " " Please , " Prue said . " Please ! " Clive looked around and she felt as if he were seeing her for the first time . Then , slowly , he smiled . " Hello , " he said . " You 're very nice . " He took her arm and put it over his and they left . They went along the street , walking heedlessly , not speaking . He patted her arm , endlessly . They went past the cinema , along the darkening streets . Beyond the town , she drew a deep breath . " Phew ! " she said . " Think nothing of it , " he said . " But I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm sorry  --  for you . " " No , you were right . Haystacks are  --  much nicer . " " Cleaner , anyhow . " " And not sordid at all , " she said . " Not at all . " He held her arm closely , and they turned a corner going in step . " You know something ? " he said . " What ? " " You 're damned nice . " " Am I ? " " Yes , shall I tell you ? " " I 'd like something to cheer me up . I do n't want to cry . He was such a grimy little man  --  it was contagious . " Her voice sounded small and far away . He patted her arm . " You 're real , " he said . " Am I ? " " Yes . You 're much nicer than a smack on the lug . " " What does that mean ? " 81 a " That 's what a chap in my bunch says . Chap named Montague . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that when he feels good . You 're much better than a smack on the lug . " " Then I 'm all right ? " " That and more . " " You know , sometimes you can be very nice and understanding , Mr. Briggs ? " " Thank you , Miss Cathaway . You know , that 's a funny name  --  but pretty , too . At first , it sounded false . But  --  since I 've seen you , it really sounds all right  --  as if it fits . " " Thank you . It is n't too common , especially down here . I was born in London , but it 's a North Country name . My grandfather 's place is up there  --  in Yorkshire . " " Why , I 'm Yorkshire myself . " " You are ? Our family 's place is Oddale  --  beyond Otley . Do you know it ? " " No . I come from  --  a more crowded area . " " But you do n't sound Yorkshire . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can talk it . Eigh lass , tha ' knaws us tongues nivver loise it . " She laughed quickly . " You sound like grandfather when he loses his temper . " She looked up as they turned the corner . " Oh , we 're back by the War Memorial , " she said . " So we are . I do n't know how we got back here . " He looked at the silhouette against the western sky  --  the bulk of carved stone . " The hen of the British Empire setting on the sun . " he said . " I wonder what it will hatch out . Shall we take a bus ? " " If you will . It 's been such a nice outing . " " I was glad to show you such a nice time , Miss Cathaway . " They climbed into the bus . Now , jammed among people , they spoke no more . The vehicle went through the darkening clay , and their bodies swayed together in the rhythm . After they had left the bus they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree . " This is far enough for you , is n't it ? " " I 'd  --  I would n't mind if you took me a little further . " They went slowly on the road , their feet kicking ahead of them . " You 've been a good sport about today , " he said. 821 " Do n't give it another thought . " After a pause he said : " Shall I see you again ? " " Do you wish to ? " " My God , the defenses we poor humans have . This fencing ! " She did not answer . " Prudence . " " Yes ? " " Will you come away with me ? " She stood a moment unmoving in the blackness . Then she said : " Yes . When ? " " It would have to be  --  soon . " " How much more leave have you ? " He drew his breath . " Ten more days . Ten , beginning tomorrow . It 's up the twenty-fifth . " She stood silently so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " It is n't that , " she said . " There 's so many things to figure out . I might get a weekend . Weekend after next . " He considered . " Now you hesitate , " she said . He laughed . " No  --  there 's things for me to figure out . I promised to meet Old Monty in London on the twentieth and go on a binge . But I could call that off . " " I would n't have you do that . " " It 's all right . " " No , wait a moment , " she said . " I forgot about the most important thing . The end of next week  --  would n't be any good . " " What do you mean , would n't be any good ? " " Do n't be masculinely dense , please . I mean , I wo n't be any good . " " Oh . " They stood in silence . " Ca n't you get this coming week off ? " he asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I do n't know . " " Could n't you ask ? Have you had leave ? " " Not yet . " " Well , do n't you come due for leave  --  like we do in the army ? " 831 " We 're supposed to . I have n't been in service long enough , though . There 's other girls ahead of me . But they 're very decent . I could ask . " " You 'll ask , then ? " " Of course . " " Shall I meet you  --  by the tree  --  tomorrow ? " " No . I 'll drop you a note . " " That 's too long . Could n't you telephone ? Down the pub . The Ram 's Head . They have a telephone . I 'll be there at eight tomorrow night . I 'll be in the bar . " " All right , " she said . " I 'll telephone . " He touched her with his hands . It was dark at last . He drew her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then they parted in the blackness . He stood , listening to her footsteps going away. 84JCHAPTER XTHE moment he heard her voice he was flooded by a feeling of unreality  --  as if he had been carried in a strong current to strange places and alien doings and now , suddenly , wondered how he came to be in that place and doing those things . " Yes , it 's me , " he said into the telephone . Her voice sounded high and too frankly full of gladness . " I got it , darling . It 's all right . " In his mood , his mind dwelt on the word " darling . " It bound him too closely . He felt uncomfortable in its possessiveness . " Are n't you pleased ? " He brought his mind back to the conversation . " Of course . " " You do n't sound like it . " " Forgive me . It 's just  --  where I 'm talking . " " Yes , there 's a fearful row . I can hear it here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over it . " " Can you hear me all right ? " " Yes , I can hear . " " I 've got ten days , starting at reveille tomorrow . Say you 're glad ! I had an awful time wangling it . " " I 'm glad . " " Then  --  where shall we meet ? " He was empty of feeling . " At the station , " he said . " The side going West . " " But I 'm supposed to be on the East side . My transportation 's made out for London . I did n't know where . . . " " It does n't matter . No one will care what side ... " 85 " But they might . Please let me  --  be silly . " " Now , if you feel that way . . . " " All right , " she said . " I 'll be on the West side . There 's a train  --  wait till I look . There 's one  --  just after ten . We 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you till we 're in  --  you 'll know it 's all right . " " What for ? " " I do n't know . So many of the girls . . . " " What do you care what they think ? " " It is n't what they think . It 's what I feel . Do n't ask me about it . Be gentle with me , please . " " Of course . You 'll be in uniform , will you ? " " Certainly . " " I see . Could n't you bring some other clothes ? " " I could scrape something together . " " All right . " " I do n't guarantee that they 'll be very West End . " He wanted it to end . " You like talking on the telephone , do n't you ? " " I like talking to you . " The words , detached from her presence , seemed too arch . She was still talking . " It 's easier to talk this way , darling . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You poor clear . And I 'm in a beautiful glass and wood cubicle with the temperature a hundred in the shade and the air a record of every perfume ever used in this camp . I 'll ring off . See you about ten tomorrowthen . Please say you 're excited . " He lashed himself mentally . " I am , Prudence . Really I am . " " Truly ? " " Of course I am . " " You 're not really , " she said , quietly . " But we 'll pretend you are . Good-by . " " Good-by , " he mumbled . As he spoke he heard the telephone click emptily . Then the noise of jumbled voices and the heavy smell of ale and long-dead tobacco smoke struck him keenly . More than anything else he wanted to run away  --  to leave this place as he had left Leaford  --  to start into the night and go , aimlessly , in any direction , anywhere . To go  --  somewhere else. 86CHAPTER XIYOUNG Hamish saw his brother across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hat from the check-girl and inspecting it fore and aft as if he would find , with great joy , that it was n't his own . Hamish started away , hesitated , and went back . Willfred saw him . " Hamish ! " " Hello , Willfred . " The older brother turned to the two men with him . Hamish heard him mentioning their names perfunctorily . Then the four stood in a moment of indecision . " I 'll be getting along , " Hamish said . " No  --  er . . . " Willfred turned to the others . " I think we 've covered everything then , have n't we ? " He did not wait for an answer . He put his hand on Hamish 's shoulder . " Let 's pop in the bar . " " But if you 're busy , Will ? " " No , we ironed it all out at dinner . " He did n't say what had been ironed out . He propelled Hamish down the steps to the bar , and they found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in full tide . The people crowded politely in the small space . " Scotch ? " " Yes . " " Two . " They watched until the drinks came . " Three cheers ! " 87 " Merry-merry ! " Willfred looked around , happily . " Quite a crowd . " " Yes . " " What keeps you in so late ? " " Oh ...  --  Hamish spread his hands and lifted his shoulders . " Oh , do n't let me pry , " Willfred laughed . " You 're not prying . In fact , I was just playing with the idea of going to the cinema . That 's all . " " Good God , Hamish , what a thing to do ! When a man starts going to cinemas , it 's an admission of some malaise  --  loneliness , welt-schmerz  --  some escapism . " Willfred said it sententiously . Hamish , looking up , caught his brother watching him in the mirror behind the bar . As if to defend himself Hamish lifted his glass in a salute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his theme . " Look here , Hamish . What about Iris ? " " Iris ? What about her ? Oh , you mean being down at Leaford . It 'll work itself out . " He thought : I knew that 's what he brought me down here for . Iris . Wilifred said : " I 'm not trying to pry , Hamish . It 's merely that Leafordis n't the best place to have the youngsters . " Quick switch , Hamish thought . But you 'll wear me down and get back to it before we 're through . And I do n't know about Iris myself . My God , I wish I did know . He said : " Is Leaford really bad ? " Willfrcd coughed and then picked up a handful of salted nuts . He ate one meticulously , and lowered his voice . " It  --  cr  --  looks as if it might be not quite the best place . Probably have to make it a solely military area before we 're through , I hear . Nothing definite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose , and not a word . But it 's  --  being considered . " I-Iarnish pulled the theme to generalities smoothly . " You mean it looks bad for us ? " " Well  --  you can draw the conclusion for yourself . There he is , twenty miles away . He 's certainly on our front doorstep . Of course , we 're shooting down scores of his planes . But the thing is , he can afford to88lose planes , we ca n't . If he can keep it up , we 're blinded . And then it 'll be  --  what did they say in the last war ? Il n'y a plus for us . " " You mean  --  invasion ? " " Yes . " " But  --  you 're not using that for a political scare , you chaps ? " Wilifred smiled benignly , and lowered his voice . " Hamish , there 's heads been toppled recently , and there 'll be lots more heads to topple , because their owners have been wrong . Well , I do n't intend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance . I do n't intend to be wrong . I accept invasion as a near-sure probability . " " Good God , no ! " " Good God , yes . You know , there 's no special ordinance handed down from heaven that Britain must n't be invaded . It has been done , quite frequently . Y'know  --  Caesar , Hengist , Horsa , William  --  Romans , Norse , Danes , Vikings , Normans and so on . " " I suppose so . " " Well , I just pass it on to you  --  personally , of course . The South Coast is n't going to be healthy . And if I had any relatives there , I 'd get them cleared out now . You should insist that Iris ... " " It 's a bit difficult . You see , she wo n't come to London , because she thinks it wo n't be safe . And her father 's near a steel works . And she wo n't . . . " Willfred nodded . He knew the story , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . " It 's all silly , her quarrel with father , " Willfred said . " You know what it is , do n't you ? " " Of course . Some woman of his earlier clays , and he has the decency to see she does n't go destitute in her old age . And that 's father 's kept woman ! I 've told Iris , but ... " Willfred laughed . " If she could see her . She 's a plump old thing . Practically senile . Lives way out on the Millings Road . " Hamish stared at Willfred . " Oh , I looked into it , " Willfred laughed . " You know , quietly and on my own . She 's  --  well , like an old retired servant . He used to drop in to see her once in a while  --  but as far as its meaning anything  --  you know , physically  --  there 's been nothing to that for the last twenty-five years . " " Well , whatever it is , " Hamish said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iris is  --  pretty strait-laced , you know . But  --  I can see father 's side . What could he do ? Could n't chuck the old girl out into the workhouse . I give him that . " " Of course . And it does n't cost him above three hundred a year , " Winfred laughed . " Oh , I looked into it . " Hamish cupped his hands about the glass . " You know , he 's getting along , " Willfred said . " Your youngsters would do him no end of good . He just dotes on them . Of course , there 's Roger 's girl  --  but she 's a girl , after all . And it 's boys  --  grandsons . You know , there 's a time in life when suddenly people seem to want children again  --  and it 's way past their own procreative age . He 's at it now . Your youngsters 'd give him some point in life . " " He 's got a point in life right now  --  getting into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , Hamish . But . .. " Willfred lifted his shoulders . " They wo n't take him ? " Hamish asked . " Well , he 's seeing Bullyer . Bullyer ca n't help him . Bullyer ca n't help himself  --  not after that Dunkirk mess . Condout  --  between you and me  --  is the man . But he would n't have any real use for father . I sent out a feeler . Oh , he could get something  --  local camp command or training depot . But not a real command . " Hamish thought suddenly of his father , sitting in offices , waiting appointments that always seemed to be deferred . He got down from the stool . " It 's hell , " he said . " Wanting to go and not being able to . It must be a very private sort of hell . " Willfred got down and followed him . They went to the lobby and out to the street . Without speaking , they turned together and walked along . The black-out kept the city center fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You ca n't imagine anything happening  --  to Old London , " Hamish said , moodily . " Yes , you ca n't imagine anything fairly well established being disrupted , " Willfred said . " It 's so in all life . Now marriage . .. " Hamish ( lodged the opening . " Do n't tell me you 're thinking of adding marriage to your other successes . " " I was n't thinking about me . I was thinking about you . " Their feet fell in a slow march. 90 " What about Iris , Hamish ? " " What about her ? " " Well , the whole business . You see , when a chap and his wife start living at distances  --  it 's going for a break . It 's natural . Marriage , I 've found , is habit-forming . Some chaps  --  like me and like Prentiss Saintby  --  we never get infected . . . " " Oh , how 's Saintby getting along in the States ? Have you heard anything ? " " No . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaps , once inoculated  --  theyget used to phases of it . " " Oh , do n't worry . " " I do n't worry , Hamish . But you 're my brother . And I see the signs . Iris staying away . You . . . " " There 's a taxi , " Hamish said . He whistled , and the car came over through the moon dusk . He stood by the door . " Can I drop you , Willfred ? " " No , I 've still got another conference . Keeps us , going these days . " " I suppose so . Well , good night . " " Good night  --  and . . . " Hamish smiled in the darkness . " Do n't worry , Willfred , " he said . " However I solve it  --  I ' 11 do it very decently . " " That 's true , " Willfred said , crisply . " That 's the very comforting thing about your type , Hamish . We can always depend upon you to do everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very decent . " Willfred smiled as the taxi ground away. 911CHAPTER XIITHE countryside was a moving tapestry of rare perfection . The time of the harvest was near . The unusually glorious summer had brought all green things to a rich fullness . Already the Land Girls of the new war were getting in the hay harvest . In unmown fields the daisies stood white and the sunlight lay warmly over the land . The telephone wires dipped and dipped in hypnotic rhythm beyond the window as he watched this wealth of August . Then he heard her voice . " Please say you 're glad to see me , " she said . There was an edge of tears to her tone , but he felt he could not turn his head . " I am , " he said . " You should know I am . " She looked down at the floor of the compartment . " I 'm not being silly , " she said . " But I would like you to say something to buck me up . After all , it 's upsetting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I . . . I . . . " His head rang with a curious aching . But he was repelled by his own self-pity . He turned from the window in a surge of anger against himself , and kneeling before her he lifted her chin with his hand . He looked into her eyes , steadily . Now , close to her , he could see the light , flecked sunflower patterns in the center of the gray-blue irises . The whites of her eyes were unmuddied . He shifted his too-close gaze to her hair . It was smooth , honey-colored . He lifted her cap and set it aside . " I 've never seen you with your cap off before , " he said. 92Her hair was drawn back simply from a center parting to the knot at the back of her head . " Honey top , " he said . He touched her hair with his hand . " Real ? " he said . She nodded , and her eyes were half-tearful . " In a fake world , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's real  --  and you 're real , Prudence . You 're very real . So much realer than I am . " " I 'm not . I 'm a fearful person . And a coward , and so much afraid . " " Now , now , " he said . " You 're the realest thing  --  right at this moment , one of the few things I believe in . You must n't mind if I am often lessthan you . " " You 're not less . I could n't like you if you were . " " I like you , too . " She nodded , slowly . " You tell the truth , " she said . " And for that  --  you may kiss me . " Clive took her face between his hands and kissed her . And then , ashe knelt there , the door opened with a harsh grating sound . He saw theconductor , a seedy man with mustache adroop as if wet with tea drops . " Whoops , " the conductor said , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapped on the glass . It was a comedy exit , and they burst into glad laughter . " It 's all right , " Clive said . " Cone in . " The man came in , averting his eyes exaggeratedly . " Sorry to interrupt yer , sir . But I 've got to punch your tickets . " Clive rose , and they began to fumble for the tickets . The conductor stood , waiting , his eyes lifted to the ceiling . " And she 'd never ' ad ' er ticket punched before , " he quoted , quietly , as if to himself , but knowing they could hear him . He looked down at the tiny squares of cardboard . " One for Leaford , " he chanted . " And one for Pompey ! Good old Pompey ! " He handed the tickets back . " Different objectives , but the same path , " he chanted . " Must be friends , eh ? " The cheerful griminess of the man enveloped them . " Of course . We 're very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at them with a sort of pushing motion. 931 " I knew it the moment I saw yer , " he said . Clive found a florin and held it out to him . " Could we keep this compartment ? " ' The man cocked a finger , half in salute and half in a conspiratorial gesture . " See what I can do . I 'll be right back . " When he came back he knocked at the door . He slid it aside and put a card against the window . " Private , reserved , " he said . " ' Gainst the rules  --  but we have so little business these days . " " Well , tell us about business , " Clive said . " How is it ? " The man shut himself inside with them and leaned against the door . " To sum it up in a word , sir . .. " " Think of that , " Clive said . The man grinned , appreciatively . " Well , I 'll leave yer , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the last war mesclf . I know how it is . " " How is it ? " Clive said . " Glad you asked me , sir . Since you ' ave , I should say that amor longer est , and tempus fudgits . Latin , that is , as undoubtedly you both recognize . Used to say that to me old woman when I was on leave . She was n't me old woman then . Just engaged  --  that was all . " " Yes ? " " Yes , sir . Well , ' ere I stand , wasting your fudgiting tempus . Goodby , sir . And thank you . And  --  good luck . " " Good luck to you , too , " Clive said . The man paused by the door . " I ' 11  --  pull down your blind , " he said , in a sort of mock reproof. lIe ( lid so , and then he was gone . Prudence sat on the edge of the seat , looking into infinity . Clive , opposite her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a photo of Llandudno , one of the Menai Bridge , one of Fountains Abbey . Ile cleared his throat , and he saw the focus of her eyes come to him . IIe smiled . " You know , " he said . " They 've had those there for years  --  ever since I was a kid . They must be permanent  --  like the Magna Carta or the Dover cliffs . " She did not answer . " Cheerful bloke , the conductor , " he said . She did not answer , still. 94 " What 's the matter ? " She shook her head . " Yes , " she said . " He was cheerful . Only . . . " " Only what ? " " Only  --  you ca n't understand . But  --  this was the first time in my life I 've been included in a look of bawdiness . " " Oh , come now . He was n't bawdy . " " You do n't see it . A man could n't . Only  --  all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at as if I were a china vase . Nice to look at  --  but that 's all . And then , all of a sudden , I 'm looked at as if I were  --  what ? " " A thunder mug , " he said , curtly . " You 're not helping . No , as if suddenly I 'm something utilitarian , hot and alive  --  and naked  --  with all my insides visible from the outside . You would n't know what I mean , unless you 'd been a girl all your life until . . . " " Do n't let it worry you . He meant to be friendly . " " I know  --  but the way he pulled down the blind and shut the door ... " " He meant to be friendly , I tell you . Ca n't you understand ? The warm , gregarious , friendly understanding of the common man  --  or have you no touch with common man ? He meant it generously  --  his offering to you . Friendliness ! " She put out her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I mean . " " Well , what do you mean ? " " Do n't be angry . It does n't matter . " She sat back and looked through the window . Then she turned and smiled at him . " You must n't mind me . Be a little patient . If I take myself seriously  --  that 's part of me and do n't dislike any part of me . " He stared through the window without answering . " Closing the door , " she said . " Do n't you see , Clive ? There are so many doors shutting behind me just now  --  and sometimes I want to stop it all for a while . Not to go back , because the doors shut permanentlyand you ca n't go back . I know I want to go on  --  only sometimes I get a bit breathless and I want to say : Stop  --  just a moment . Hold the world still , please  --  just long enough for me to get a little bit used to being where I am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , " she said . " You 'll make lines come . " 951Slowly he smiled , and then lifted his forefinger . " Listen , " he said . She lifted her head , and looked from side to side . " What is it ? " " The world , " he said . " It 's stopping . And it is n't going to move again until you say : I 've got my breath . I 'm used to being where I am . I 'm utterly bored with being where I am . I want it to go on again . ' " She looked at his eyes , and he winked . " It 's wonderful , " she said . " That 's one of the nice parts about it . I never thought that when you had a man of your own he could say such simple things and make you feel so wonderful inside . That 's a part of it I 'd never imagined . And you do it so well . Is it because it 's really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He shook his head and put his finger to his lips in dumb motion . " Everything 's stopped , " he said . " Even clocks . Even my mouth . " He closed his eyes and lay back , feeling now the gentle rhythm of the train , the swaying , the train-smell , the endless jazz beat of the wheels on the rail joints , and the clacking at the points . He opened his eyes when he heard her laughing . " It 's all over now , " she said . " You must n't mind me . Poor Niobe , weeping over her departed maidenhood . " " You said maidenhood , did n't you ? " " I did . " She came and sat beside him . " It 's over now , " she said . " And he was truly a nice man  --  the conductor . It was nice of him to include me with the living people instead of keeping me out with the china vases . Even if I 'm a thunder mug . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than vases  --  and very human . " " Oh , very . " " I Ic was a nice conductor . I sec what you mean now . IIe made it all human and sad and yet happy  --  just the opposite of the man at the hotel who made it all grimy . " " Let 's keep that smudge out of it . " " It 's like vegetable , animal , mineral . All my life until now it 's been a useless sort of vegetable life . Now I 'm animal . That does n't sound nice . " " It 's all right . When we 're planted we 'll damned soon take up the mineral phase of existence . " 96 " And tempus does fudgit  --  and the world wo n't stop and let you examine your fears . So  --  on to the next door ! Because . . . " Her eyes went round the compartment . " . . . We 're getting better at it . At least we have luggage this time , darling . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel at Leaford . " " Is that where we 're going ? " " If you like . " " I like . " He looked at her bags . " You have some other clothes ? " he asked . " Some . " " You could change here , " he said . " Then when we get off  --  you wo n't be in uniform . " " What 's wrong with the uniform ? " " Nothing . But you 're a sergeant  --  and in my army life I 'm a lowest private . Every time I see the stripes I feel at a psychological disad-vantage . " " That is n't it . Why do you hate the uniform so much ? " " I do n't hate it , I tell you . Only  --  I 'd like to think for a few moments , sometimes  --  that there is n't any war . " " I see , " she said , slowly . She opened a grip . She looked in it , turned to him and then smiled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well  --  I 'm not used to it . Or  --  it does n't matter . You keep your eyes open if you want to . Only I do wish I had some nice things . " " What do you want ? " " If you were a woman you 'd know . " She took off her tunic and unhooked her skirt . " Here I go , practically on my honeymoon and " " And what ? " She stepped from the skirt in a flurry of motion . " All her life a girl wonders and imagines . How it will be , and where it will be , and what it will be . I suppose every girl plans it , and you think of a beautiful lounging robe and  --  and  --  well , you know what one would think of . And then , here I am , caught . . . " " . . . With your trousers down . " " What an expression ! " 97 " Do you know , you have very pretty legs , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can say nice things . " He rose from his seat . She clutched the dress toward her and turned , holding out one hand . " Please  --  do n't . " " You 're very pretty , too . " " I know , darling  --  but  --  please look out of the window . They say the countryside has never been so beautiful as this year . Look at that . " " Why should I ? " " Oh , I 've got no nice underclothes with me , darling . And I 'm mad enough to bite a parson , because I have such wonderful ones home , and I left them all behind to be Spartan and businesslike for the duration . Please look out of the window , and then , when I 'm dressed , I 'll tell you . And you turn round and be no end surprised , and tell me how pretty I look out of uniform . " He stared at her and then smiled . " All right , " he said . He sat beside the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught in an induced hypnosis , and he felt his head nodding in answer to the pattern of movement . His mind seemed very far away when he heard her voice . " Now , darling . " He turned to look at her . His eyes were dulled by the brightness of the daylight beyond the window . The compartment seemed dark . Then , like a fade-in of the cinema , he saw her emerge  --  first just a slimness in a dark-blue figured dress . There was a wide-brimmed hat set back from her head . It framed the wash of her hair , and her face beneath was a pale smudge . His mind ricocheted and a fragment of it was thinking : " Laurcncin was right . I never saw how she meant it until now . " " Well ? " she said . I pier voice wakened him again . Tie moved his lips . He wanted time to think . This girl  --  now she was like a stranger  --  a taller , cooler , slimmerstranger than the girl in the bulk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasped at a feeling that this was not new . All this had happened , exactly as now , once before . Long , long ago it had been . Why should one have such odd sensations ? Of course it had n't happened . What quirk of the mind made one feel as if it had ? This was the only time it had happened . And yet  --  there was still the sensation98that he was reliving a cycle of incidents all over again . It had happened , exactly like this . She had turned . She had said , in exactly the same tone : " Well ? " 1i And he had said  --  had said . . . " You 're  --  you 're very pretty . " " Thank you , sir . You remembered well . " IhHe rose and took her hand . " You should n't have done that , " he said . " You should n't have asked me to say it , because it 's left me nothing to say of my own accord . " She disengaged his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppositeher . " You 're very beautiful , " he said , slowly . " That 's nice , " she smiled . " Before I 've only been pretty ; but nowI 'm beautiful . It 's all progressing very nicely , is n't it ? " IIIShe sat opposite him , primly like a child in a Sunday-school seat . It il was as if , in some feminine-childish way , she was tremendously pleased1111 , with herself. 99 l " No , please . Wait a moment . " He looked at her , and saw her face an ashy splotch in the interiordimness . " Good Lord , " he said . " Are n't you well ? Can I get you a drink ? " " Yes , " she said . " That 's it . Ca n't we have a drink ? " He took her arm and walked to the lounge . They sat in the chairs . She sat , unfeeling , unmoving , until she saw the glass before her . " Drink that down , " he said . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , staring at the dazzle of light that was the window . She drew a breath and lifted her head . " All right , " she said . " Now . " She rose , and he walked beside her . The lift raced upward . They were walking down a lonesome corridor . The boy was unlocking the door . They were inside alone . She saw him flick his hat toward a bed and hated him for it . She went to the window , turning her back to him and the room , and stared out . She heard his voice . " Ah , there 's my bag . They 've been keeping it here for me . " She stared out to the ocean , staring at it but not seeing it . She heard him speaking again . " It is n't a bad room at all , is it ? " he said , casually . She did not move . She drew a breath and began speaking . " It 's really a very nice room  --  sunny and everything . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he able to get a good room . The place is practically deserted . And twenty-two shillings a day is high enough for bed and breakfast . Is n't it twenty-two shillings they said ? I wonder if he thought I was really your wife . He could n't have . I did n't have a wedding ring on . I should have got one  --  at the sixpenny bazaar . You could n't tell them from real for all intents and purposes . . . " He heard only the sound of her voice , gabbling quickly . He blew out his breath and then got up . He went to her and put his hand on her shoulder . " Stop talking , " he said . " What do you really mean behind all those words ? " " I do n't mean anything . " " Of course you do . " " All right , I do , then . I 'm just wondering . " " What ? " I01CHAPTER XIIIAs THEY left the train she felt that events had caught her in a trap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm trapped now . There 's no escape . I 've trapped myself . She hardly felt the tug of ocean wind at her skirts as she watched the porter putting the luggage in the taxi . It seemed as if everyone were racing with malicious speed : the porter slamming the cab door behind them , the driver whirling the cab through spaces of empty airiness that were seaside resort streets . She had only impressions of bleak , windwashedgray fronts of Victorian houses . The cab was charging at gleeful speed along a lonesome Esplanade , with monotonous rows of iron lampposts . The lampposts had their backs turned coldly and were gazing out to the crashing sea . With the telescoped time of a nightmare the cab was at a place . The brass plates said " Channel Hotel . " She had only time to breathe once , to see gray stone walls , a potted palm at each side of the door , and then the uniformed boy had the luggage and was racing with fearful speed up the four steps. 11er heels were clicking on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiles . She heard him speaking to the man at the counter . It was a horrible conspiracy of a world of men . She watched a woman come through the door , look at them quickly , and go to the lift . She put out her hand as if for support . He turned as he felt the touch . He saw the woman with the trim figure standing in the lift . A few days ago , standing here , he had mentally disrobed her . " All right , " he said , curtly . " Let 's get the lift . It 's waiting . " 100 " I 'm wondering just what I 'm letting myself in for . That 's all  --  and I have a right to wonder it if I want . " " You do . You 're a free agent . You have a right to do anything you want . " She did not answer . " Look here , " he said . " I do n't want any agony for anyone . If you feelthat way about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again  --  or you canalone if you wish . If you 've changed your mind  --  just say so , that 's all . " " That 's cowardly , " she said . " Putting it up to me . " " Well , what the hell ... " " I do n't want to be asked . I want to be told . You 're the man . Take the responsibility of decision ! " " Oh , hell , " he said . He went and sat on the bed . She stood with her back to him , staring from the window . Then at last she came , quietly , and sat beside him . " You misunderstood me , " she said . " I do n't want you to say I can go if I want . A woman does n't want that . I want to be told that everythingelse in the world could happen , anything in the world  --  but above everything else you did n't want me to go  --  would n't let me go  --  could n't keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I meant . " " One ca n't say that . " " I suppose not , " she said . Then she laughed and got up quickly . " How silly of me , " she said . " Wondering about being here . And I 'm here , are n't I ? Shall we unpack ? " " I 've nothing much to unpack , " he said . " I 'll have to buy a few things . " " I see , " she said . She went back to the window . " Then how about going for a walk ? It 's such a nice day and . . . " Ife looked up at her . His mind lost itself in indecisions . Then a fragment of memory caught him . " A very nice day ? " he asked . " A very , very nice day , " she said , turning , slowly . " Well , if it 's a very , very nice day , " he said . " That 's different . " He picked up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that she was smiling . he smiled in answer . " Shall we explore ? " He held out his arm . " We 'll explore , " she said , taking it. roeThey went along the long , carpeted hall . The place was deathly quiet with the silence of unoccupancy . It seemed , in that quietness , an act of rudeness to ring for the lift . They went down the steps , and across the lobby . The uniformed boy and the small man behind the desk watched them go . They came into the sunshine , and it made them blink . They marched along the Esplanade , past the ornamental lampposts , past the benches where no one sat , " I know what it is , " she said , suddenly . " It 's like being at the seaside in winter  --  no one here , the Esplanade stretching emptily for a mile , everything all to yourself . Just like winter  --  only the sun 's shining . Have you been at the seaside in winter ? " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes . It 's much the nicest time to be here  --  although this is very nice . It 's much nicer like this  --  without any crowds . " " Oh , much nicer , " he said . They went along steadily until from the hotel their figures were dots , far up the vanishing perspective of the Esplanade . That afternoon they walked east , far out to the place where the promenade became a road , to where the road became a path going up to the cliffs . They bent their knees , climbing steadily , up to the top where the breeze blew strongly and evenly . They spoke about the smell of the sea  --  the strong odor of rotting kelp and spray . They sat by the cliff edge , watching how the waves below in the bay came like tiny eddies , creeping with a synthetic sort of time and space of their own . Only faintly , up there , could they hear the boom of the waves as they struck the looming chalk face . As humans they became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She hugged her knees and spoke , her voice small in the great spaces . " I 'm sorry I was so ratty , " she said . " There 's no need to be upset , " he told her . " Not really  --  only  --  you see , I ran into my aunt . " " You what ? " " My aunt . " " Your aunt ! Where ? " " At the hotel . Did you see the woman in the lift  --  she went up alone when we went to get the drink . " He stared at her . " You mean to say that woman  --  the rather trim one in the tailored suit  --  that 's your aunt ? " 103She nodded . " Is n't it incredible , that of all the places we could pick , she 's at the same place for some unearthly reason ? " " No , it is n't incredible , " he said . " It 's strangely just and trite , that 's all . I never knew of anyone who  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , who did n't run into someone he knew . It never fails . " She nodded , slowly . " Well , I say , " he said . " Did she see you ? " " Oh , yes . " " Perhaps she did n't . " " She did . " " Well  --  by God . We ca n't go back there , then . " She lifted her head . " Why not ? I 'm not going to run away from Iris or anyone else ! " " But if you meet . .. " " We wo n't . I know Iris . She 'll move immediately and pretend she has n't seen me , and save it all up for some opportune occasion . " " But if you do meet , what 'll she think ? " She lifted her head . " Iris , " she said , " has no right to assume anything wrong about my conduct , no matter what the circumstances are , or what the exterior evidences might lead anyone to conclude . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he thumped his knee in laughter . " Oh , my Lord God , " he said . " I never heard anything so beautifully illogical in my life . So beautifully and proudly and magnificently illogical . Let us return to the hotel with those brave banners going on before . " He took her arm and they walked back to the town . They had dinner at the hotel . They were the only ones iii the ( lining room . The old waiter stood at attention near their table . The place was so silent that there was a self-consciousness to talking . They could feel only the lonesomeness of the place , the emptiness of the room , the forlornness of themselves . After dinner they sat on a bench on the deserted Esplanade , and watched the clear light drift away . The sunlight that had left the place went marching across wide oceans to new shores , going west , across a new continent , over far plains , into ranges of mountains and dry , sun-baked lands. 104 1CHAPTER XI VTHE trouble with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if America were a holiday world . It was n't really , he reasoned . It was only because of its foreignness . Foreign lands always seemed to be living in perpetual holidays . Probably because ordinarily it was only during holidays that one went to foreign lands . He docketed the thought neatly , and looked from the car window . The town looked like a horrible jumble of purpose : a too-new skyscraperwith modernistic coffee shop under its lee , then ramshackle , wooden-fronted shops within a stone's-throw ; motorcars that gleamed smugly like this one , then rusty rattletraps with mudguards tied up with baling wire , and driven by people who wore that unending clothing of blue overall-ish stuff . That blue seemed like the uniform of the working class in this land . Funny , somebody had that once in a story  --  Wells , that was it  --  writing about a future world . Workers all in blue garb , nobles in something else  --  probably purple . But it was quite gay in a way , that blue  --  deep color of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that came from repeated launderings . The people seemed quite happy and well-fed , though . He grasped at another thought . It was like a mixture of New York and the cowboy cinemas he 'd watched when a boy . That was it . A lot of people still wore those very large cowboy hats . It made the city look a little rnasqueradish  --  but the men did n't seem to be at all self-conscious about wearing them . He turned his eyes ahead . There was the bullethead of the Negro 105 Jchauffeur . The hair was cropped , but you could see the spots where the kinky whorls would grow if it were longer . That was another part of America . Negroes . They seemed quite jolly chaps  --  interesting servants . He had heard they were somewhat of a problem . They did n't seem like a problem to him , the ones he 'd seen  --  the porters on the train coming west . His eyes went beyond to the road . There was a tangle of streetcar tracks and paving bricks . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He smiled and looked at the man beside him . " It rides beautifully , Mr. Lachran , " he said . The man nodded , energetically and gladly . " You ca n't get a better one , " he said . " It 's a British car , you know . " " Oh , yes ? I had n't noticed . " That was another part of America  --  being lost in the moves of conversation . Back home , in England , you could understand the words a man said , understand what he meant behind the words , and understand what he thought behind his meaning . Here , you had to listen so carefully to the pronunciation that you only understood the words . You lost everything else concentrating on that . And people were different . That was a thing you had to understand . For instance , when he 'd said the car rode nicely  --  you could n't expect that such a remark would bring a delight so obvious to the other man . Yet it had  --  a childish sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an open sort of aged childishness . On the other hand , that might be one of the things hard to understand about America . It might be a mask . It could well be . The man was n't an idiot . No man got to Lachran 's power  --  a real czar in his own field  --  by being an idiot . Saintby sighed . He wished fervently that Lachran were a Britisher , and then he could understand him really , see the real man behind all the exteriors . " Yes , " Lachran said , slowly . " We can turn out stuff on a line ; but we ca n't touch you chaps when it comes to a handmade job . " " Perhaps that is true , " Saintby said , carefully . " It is true , " Lachran grated . " And its your strength  --  and your weakness . You do n't seem to have the mind for mass production  --  and you 're going to have to learn it if you want to exist  --  in this war , you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ io6 " You 're darned right it 's true . It 's all right making something good when you 've got all the time in the world in which to make it  --  and all the time in the world in which to use it . But what 's the use handfinishinga thing you 're going to send out to be blown up maybe next week ? Huh ? " " Perhaps it 's our national temperament to do our best always , no matter what we 're doing , " Saintby said , a little stiffly . " Sure you do . Sure . That 's what we like about you Britishers . But you ca n't do it with everything . " Lachran turned away , and leaned forward to tap on the glass . The car was gliding through formal shrubbery to a low , wooden building . " Right in there ! Right in there ! " he shouted , irascibly . " Mr. Lachran , it say . . . " " God dammit , I said right in there ! " The Negro grinned happily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . As Saintby got out he saw its bonnet almost touched the sign that said : " No Parking . Bureau of Police . " " Oh , I say , " he said . " You 're in a forbidden space . " Lachran turned , almost in surprise . " That ? " he said . " We do n't pay any attention to those things . " They went up the steps into the wooden building . In the large hall the attendants came forward quickly , like acolytes . Lachran greetedthem happily . ! " How do you like this ? " he asked . Saintby stared about him . The place was like a hunting lodge . Heads of strange antlered animals studded the walls . There was a dark gloominess to the room . " Very nice , " he said . " I thought you 'd like it , " Lachran said , happily . " It was built on the idea of an old Scotch hunting lodge  --  something of that sort . Everyone says its quite British , anyway . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went from the hall through dark doors to a veranda , and then I ! i Saintby drew his breath . Coming from the gloominess , with the mixed impressions of the city still touching his mood , he was struck by the new scene . What he saw was like another world . A gay , crowded world . There was the seclusion of the veranda , with its white napery and silver . Below were people on lawns of immaculate turf , sitting at tablesunder gay striped umbrellas . To the left was a blue-tiled swimming Il ' 107 cipool . To the right , tennis courts . Farther beyond , a polo field . Beyond that , granite mountains rising jagged to blue heights . " Oh , I say , " Prentiss said . " This is a spot ! " Lachran breathed deeply and happily . " Yes , it 's pretty good , " he said . " Does it remind you of the old country ? " Prentiss Saintby drew a deep breath . You could say the place was Monte Carlo , Hurlingham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . But the man seemed to be waiting his answer with almost pathetic anxiety . " Why , yes , " he said . " It 's just like home . " Lachran went happily to his seat . As he followed , Prentiss Saintby justified the outrageousness of his lie . If the man expected him to say it , why not give him the pleasure ? And it was unimportant . The business  --  that was the thing . If he could only get the man to hard tacks  --  but he seemed exasperatingly determined to put off everything as long as he could . That 's why he 'd been sent to the West . Prentiss sat at the table and looked out over the scene . It was a vibration of color  --  flowered walks , strange blossoming bushes , the striped umbrellas , the dresses of the women , the assorted hues of bathingsuits at the pool , the white of tennis flannels , the moving red and yellow spots of the shirts on the polo field . He saw color first  --  and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young . It was almost unbelievable . As far as he could see there was not a person who was n't young . It was almost a heaven of youth  --  sun-tanned , well-fed , handsome youth . He  --  and Lachran  --  who looked down on it , were the only unyoung ones . It was fitting that they should be detached , isolated . " You know , " Lachran said , conversationally , " my father started this club . " " Oh . indeed ? " Prentiss encouraged . " Yeh . There were a lot of Johnny Bulls here then . Younger sons of lords and dukes and so on . They came out here for hunting and what not , and stayed on . Why , they used to call this town Little England . " " Oh , indeed ? " " Yeh . That 's why there 's so many things of English character round here . You 'd enjoy staying here . " Prentiss fingered the fork before him . " It 's tremendously pleasant , " he said . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that  --  well , this is wartime for us , you know . And there 's nothing I 'd like better than to stay here  --  except of course to get businessdone . Now if you could give me any idea of a basis of . . . " " Now do n't worry , " Lachran said , almost impatiently . " Do n't worry . You saw how things are . They 're working on it , and I 'm turning it over in my mind , and when I get it all set  --  it wo n't be a basis of discussion . It 'll be something that 'll just make you happy . " " But of course , there 's an element of time . . . " " That 's all right . This is n't a case of hand to mouth . You fellows have got plenty for this year . It 's a steady supply for one year , two years from now you want . And I can give it to you . But just do n't push me ! Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suddenly , now , he knew the hardness of this man behind the bluff friendliness . There was stubbornness in the last words  --  almost a pugnacious belligerence . Lachran had spoken almost as one would to a servant . And he  --  he was the British Government . Then it was as if Lachran himself had recognized the hardness of his words and tone . For he was smiling . " Besides , " he said , laughingly , " I like you . I like to have you round . If I came over to your country , would n't you want to be hospitable to me ? " " I rather suppose so . " " Well , there you are . You 're in my country . You must n't begrudge me the chance to show you round . You know  --  when you 're here , you 're in the best goddam part of all these United States . You can travel high and low , north and south , but you 're never going to find a finer part of these United States than right here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is God 's country . " " Yes , indeed . " Prentiss sank into his thoughts . Obviously it was no use trying to nudge the old man along  --  he would n't be hurried . And you had to treat him with gloves . He was too powerful to be antagonized . And it had been a false move trying to talk business before lunch . Almost elemental , that . Wait until a man was fed before talking business . Prentiss looked up , and found Lachran smiling at him  --  his heavylinedold face suddenly shrewd and wise . " So you 've decided not to try to hurry me any more , " he said. 109ii PPrentiss drew in his breath . It was as if the old man had been able to see all the tickings and workings of his mind . He opened his mouth to speak , and then saw the funniness of it . He began laughing . Lachran 's face broke into a wide beam . " Am I so transparent ? " Prentiss said . Lachran shook his finger in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnny Bulls ' number every time , " he said , happily . " Have you really ? " " Yes . And you know what ? That 's why I like you . You take a Dago or a Dutchman . I would n't trust ' em any further than I could throw an elephant  --  and I would n't give ' em the smell off my shirt . But you Britishers  --  you make me laugh . " " Laugh ? " Lachran waved his hand in a gesture . Looking at the old , smiling face , Prentiss suddenly felt like a schoolboy . " Let 's have lunch  --  and just put your mind on that , " Lachran said . " And when we 're set to do business , I 'll let you know . How 's that ? " " All right , " Prentiss smiled . " That 's fine . Where in the hell is that  --  hey ! Maurice ! " " Here , sir . " The waiter came quietly from the doorway . Prentiss freed his mind from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americawhile Britain was at war , and settled to the contentment of a good lunch . There was a fine chowder  --  wonderful name , chowder . And excellenttrout . Lachran chatted on , happily . Prentiss found him easy to listen to . " There 's all the trout you want in those mountains , " Lachran said . " If you like to fish . . . " " I wish I had time . " " Well , i f you like to . " Lachran gazed at the mountains silently for a time . Then he nodded his head . l le waved his hand . " You know , " he said . " In my time , I 've climbed over those goddam mountains from end to end  --  and sometimes my belly flat as a griddle-cake . " " Yes ? " " Yeh ! Look , you see that peak up there  --  the far one beyond the saddle ? " IIo Prentiss looked into the clear air to where the finger pointed in the blue range . " My mother cooked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lachran paused , and Prentiss did not answer . The old man seemed to be far away . He went on again . " And the only woman for two hundred and fifty miles around . She come out here as a school teacher from Kansas to marry a feller . They got married and he died o ' lungs a year later . But she did n't sit down and she did n't go back . By God , she up and hunted a job . They were starting lumbering up there , and she went as cook . " Why , ' the boss said . This is n't no place for a lady like you . " l need the job , ' she said . He says : I mean with all these men around . They 're a tough bunch . " You just give me a tent , ' she says , and I wo n't have a minute 's trouble with any man on the job . ' " And , by God , she did n't . Not in all the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterwards , though , she began to get a bit worried . Got so 's she was n't sure whether it was because of the inherent nobility of lumberjacks , or because she was so homely she did n't inspire anyone to make a leer at her . Of course , that was kidding . Then she met my father up there . " He hauled lumber down  --  made a fortune before he was thirty and lost it again . He lost it when they hit gold up there . He went back to lumbering  --  hauling to the mines . There was no steel then . All wood shoring . He made another fortune and lost it by the time he was forty . Made two fortunes and lost ' em both before he was forty . The railroad , the second time . Railroads cleaned him out . When I was seventeen , we were flat broke  --  we lived up in a shack right up there where the foothillboulevard is now . And by the time I was twenty  --  I had half his fortune back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out , too . By God , I made some o ' them say yessir and nosir before I was through ! " Lachran nodded as if he were dozing . Prentiss felt a moment of mental clarity  --  as if for a brief moment he was seeing behind the outrageous facade of this country club in the too-clear sunshine , seeing behind the man 's American veil of accent and speech and manner , to something vital and real and truly American . Although what " truly American " was he did n't know . Only it was something that  --  that was n't pseudo-British . It was something very different from British . It was curious , he thought , that he should like and understand Americans III much better when they had this " different " American quality than when they were so much like a bad imitation of Britishers . He looked at the old man , musing . It was a hard face  --  almost a cruel face . Lined and discolored as if from years of hard living , hard drinking  --  pouched eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaging quality to the man that was almost childish in substance . Prentiss looked up at the blue mountains , beyond the polo field with its fringe of artificial-looking trees . " What was it like , " he said , " in the old days ? " Lachran looked up . Then he grinned , in a grim sort of way . He flung out his hand toward the mountains . " There was the whole goddam country , " he said . " The whole-goddam  --  country . " He stopped , as if that explained it all . " Yes ? " Prentiss said , with rising inflexion . Lachran looked up at him , almost astonished . " Well , " he said , impatiently , " that meant everything . Millions ! There was millions in it  --  just waiting . Waiting for anyone smart enough and tough enough to come and take it . And a man took what he wanted ... " Then he shook his head , slowly . " . . . But he only held what he was able . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you was able . That 's how it was . " " And you were able to hold it , eh ? " " I held it . And I licked some of the sons o ' bitches that had it coming to them . " " In the gold fields ? " " In anything . There was money in anything those days  --  if you were tough . And I was tough . Why look  --  right up there . I remember coming over that ridge one day , and there was four of ' em , sitting on their horses there waiting . I knew I could n't run , so I had to go forward . I was only twenty-two then . But I went right up and said : What the hell do you want ? ' And they said : ' Lachran . You 're putting a flume in up there , and we do n't like it . We want that water . ' " And there they sat , with their hands on their guns . So I just says : Get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' They looked at me like they thought I was crazy . One of ' em says : Lachran , I do n't know whether you 're crazy or just plain tough . ' So I sat there with'my hands crossed on the pommel , and I says : Start figuring that out for your- II2 selves , and figure it quick . ' And they just turned round and hauled out of there . " The old man laughed , and looked up at Prentiss . " So they must have figured I was tough , eh ? " " I should say so , " Prentiss said . " Four of them with pistols . " Lachran laughed . " Ah , I was tough then . I could lick anything in this valley  --  and then haul him up one side of the mountains and throw him down the other . I was tough . " He nodded to himself , and then looked up quickly at Prentiss . " You ought to see some of that country , Mr. Saintby . It 's real scenery for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but I feel at this time . . . " " Oh , do n't give that a thought . " Lachran halted and , his face suddenly beaming , he waved his hand agitatedly to a girl below . The girl swung a tennis racket in each hand in greeting . " That 's Mary , " Lachran said . " My brother 's granddaughter . " He looked up at the steward . " Sure coffee , " he said . " And Mr. Saintby  --  or he 'll probably take tea . " " Well , tea . . . " " I feel sure that you 'll like our tea , sir , " the steward said . " We do n't  --  boil linen bags with it . " " That 's right , " Lachran said . " Maurice is a Britisher , too . Are n't you , Maurice ? " " Yes , sir , " the steward said . " From Chichester . " " Oh , indeed , " Prentiss said . " Beautiful place . " " Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Prentiss thought of the processions of evil tea  --  at hotels , on trains , that he 'd had in America . Always prepared so that one tasted the inevitablelinen sack in which Americans kept doles of tea . " If I could have a good cup . . . " " Yes , sir . " Lachran looked up , slyly . " If you like tea  --  I 've got a Chinese cook up on the ranch . If you like tea , you 're his friend for life . He 'll spend half his waking hours making tea for you . " " Indeed ? " " Well , you might as well . You ca n't do anything till I 'm set . You 've H3 got to wait around here until I do get set . You might as well be up there as at that hotel . You know , some day I 'll do something about that . I 've been saying we need a good hotel for the last six years . I 'll do it , too . " Lachran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Hi ! " The girl came onto the veranda , lifting one of the rackets in salutation . " This is Mr. Saintby , Mary . He 's a Britisher  --  over here on business . " Prentiss looked up . She was a striking young woman . Like all the others below , she seemed youth and health gloriously triumphant . As if their bodies were leaping up to the sun  --  tall , sunburned . The white of her tennis clothes made the tan seem more deeply golden . A curious sort of white jockey cap held in her black hair . " Hello . " She turned away , as if ignoring him . " Did you eat ? " Lachran began . " Long ago . I had a date with the pro , and that Cecil Hawkins is still taking a lesson . She knows it 's time , but she 's just doing it to make inc mad . She 's a pill . " Prentiss noted a juvenile quality in the young woman 's petulance . " You 're coming up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that Hawkins girl and her mother are coming . " " Oh , gosh , what do you want to ask her mother for ? She 's worse than Cecil . " " Well , it 'll give you a chance to trim the tar out of her again . " " That 'll be nothing new , " the girl said . " Then I 'll see you . Mr. Saintby , here . He 's coming up for a while , too . " The girl turned , quickly . " Do you play tennis ? " Prentiss wondered why he did n't deny his acquiescence to Lachran 's invitation . " Well , i have played , " he said . He felt the need for something better . " I played in the tournament at Nice two years ago . " The young woman 's eyes lightened . " You did ? Nice ? That 's fine . There 's Johnny now  --  I 'll have to run . See you again , then . " " Yes , " Prentiss said . He was adjusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in playing tennis while all this ghastly war went on  --  as if a man were carousing on a grave . And yet , as Lachran said , it was merely a question of waiting , and one might just as well wait in comfort as go through days of dragging disagreeableness . He looked up . He saw Lachran looking at him with a smile that was either one of great age and wisdom  --  or one of childishness . CHAPTER XVTHAT first morning when he woke Clive saw her sitting by the window , looking out at the sea . He came up into full waking and lay looking at her . The edge of the sun came slot-wise through the window and touched into shouting light the edges of the white peignoir she wore . He waited , knowing she had heard him stir ; but she did not move . " Hi , " he said , finally . She looked around quickly , and smiled to reassure him . Then she turned back to the window . " Did n't you sleep well ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " you 're one of those who ca n't be talked to before breakfast . Do you bite or snarl before breakfast ? Do you curse the cat and kick the maid ? " " It was all right . You ground your teeth , horribly  --  so I got up . I 'll telephone for breakfast . What will you have ? " " Anything . " She looked at him a moment . " Then she picked up the telephone . " Breakfasts , please , " she said . " Two of grapefruit , two bacon and eggs , two toasts , two teas , that 's all . " She turned to him as she hung up . " That 's for being mentally lazy  --  you 'll eat what I do . " He watched her move back to the window . he got up and sat on the edge of the bed . " I 'm sorry , " he said . " I 'm sorry you did n't sleep well . " " You ground your teeth horribly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't mentioned in the love stories , " I16he said , trying to please her . " Some people snore . It 's never mentioned in the songs . You never get adore , implore , bedroom door , and snore . You get moon , June and spoon and then it stops . It never gets on to the part about how he ground his teeth horribly . " She smiled . " It 's hard to do that so early , especially with a headache , " he said . " Have you a headache ? " " It 's nothing . Seriously , though , " he said , " you should have wakened me . I did n't know I did that . " " No , it was interesting . You see , you talked , too . " " Talked ? What on earth did I say ? " " I wo n't tell you . " " Oh , do n't be coy . What did I say ? Did I mention any names ? " " No , you gave commands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were drilling a whole army , I should fancy  --  and using language . " " What language ? Fancy ? " " Very fancy language . " " Very , very fancy ? " She nodded her head slowly and then turned from the window and smiled . " That was nice , " she said . " Yes . Very , very fancy . " " Well , if it was very , very fancy  --  that 's different . " " It was different . You used words I 'd never heard before . " " Oh , perhaps you are n't up on words . " " Is that so ! Then perhaps you 've never been around art students and studios . " He swung his legs and lit a cigarette . " I thought in art circles they talked art . " " That 's a misconception . " " What do they talk about ? " " About food , " she said . " The best food you never ate is talked in artstudentcircles . " " Food will be here soon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm exhaustedby trying to be bright before breakfast . " " Do n't make too much effort , " she said . " Can I call for a Seidlitz Powder ? " I17 " No . I have aspirins . I 'll bathe . " " Do n't hurry . It looks as if it will cloud over . Rain probably . " " I prefer the indoor sort of showers . " He put on his mackintosh as a dressing gown and rang the bath bell . He heard her suddenly laughing and turned . " What 's so funny ? " " I ca n't tell you , " she said . " That 's all right . You have a right to your own life , too . " He sat on the bed until the knock on the door told him the bath was ready . He started to follow the old woman down the hall . Then he came back and poked his head in the door . " Be happy , " he said . " You are glad you 're here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course I am . " He looked at her and then spoke slowly . " You 're not , " he said . " But it was quite decent of you to say you were . " The rain fell steadily after breakfast . They sat in the hotel room , feelingimprisoned . At noon they ordered lunch , and kept wandering to the window to look at the drabness of the rain-wet promenade . " Oh , damnation , " he said finally , his pent-up irritation rasping in his voice . " Let 's go out anyhow . " They put on raincoats and went out to the Esplanade , going quickly . There was no incentive to talk . Going in step they came to the end of the promenade , and kept on up the hill . " It 's nice to have low heels on again , " she said . " I got so used to them in the Walls I 'd forgotten how high heels could be uncom-fortable . " " Is that so ? " he said . " Yes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind and rain came with more force , driving almost parallel to the ground . At last , by the cliff edge , they stopped . He put his arm about her . " This is better , " she said , finally . " It is n't good for us to quarrel . " " Quarrel ? You mean my explosion at the weather ? I was n't quar-reling . " " I see . Shall we go back ? " He turned and looked at her , at her face with hard highlights from I18the rain-wetness . A wisp of hair hung straggling . She saw his eyes on it , and brushed it back angrily . He wanted to speak comfortingly , but she had started away . They went down from the cliff to the promenade . Almost at the hotel he touched her arm . " Look , I 'm sorry , " he said . " Sorry for my picayune tempers . You must forgive me . " " Of course , " she said . " You 're much like my father . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nasty . " " Neither of us do , " she said . " Only there 's a frustration  --  we 're  --  I do n't know  --  empty in some way . Shut off from each other . " " Do you want to call it all off ? " he said . " Do you ? " " I certainly do if you do . " " Then it 's all right for my part , " she said . He lifted his head . " All right . I 'll take the decision . " They stalked back to the hotel . " I 'll tell them , " he said . She went on to the lift . He stopped by the desk . The little polite man looked up hopefully . " Yes , Mr. Briggs ? Anything I can do ? " " Yes . You can get the bill ready  --  we 're leaving . " " Oh , but ... " " And do n't call in Mrs. Whosis . Everything 's all right  --  it 's just that  --  we 're leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you going back to London , sir ? " " No . Just  --  well , probably back to London . " " I 'm sorry you 're leaving . And such nasty weather to travel . It seems a pity you could n't stay until tomorrow  --  since you have to pay whether you stay or not . " Clive stood in thought . Just where were they going ? Suddenly he laughed . " That 's sensible . But  --  I 'm afraid we 're moving on . " He went upstairs . Prue was sitting by the window , still wearing her mackintosh . He sat on the bed , and in the silence sought for " some hinge of speaking . Suddenly she sneezed . " Here , here , " he said . " You must n't 7catch cold . " I191 " I 'm not catching cold , " she said into her handkerchief . They sat in silence again , until once more she sneezed . " You know , you are catching cold , " he said . " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bursts of laughter . It was a quiet laugh , soaring into a bubbling note . " Tell me , if it 's funny , " he said . " I 'd like to laugh just about now . " " It is funny . I just realized what it is . It 's a honeymoon cold . I 've often heard father speak of it . And now I 've got it . " " A honeymoon cold ? " " Yes . Did n't you know ? About ninety per cent of people on their honeymoons  --  well , they get awful colds . " " They should be careful to shut the windows . " " Yes , " she said , laughing . " I like you , " he said . He saw her face , puzzled and almost childlike in the deepening light . It contorted , and she sneezed again . " Look , " he said . " This is foolish . We ca n't travel with you getting a cold . " " It really is n't a cold . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't let 's start a quarrel over that . I say it is one . You should stay over . " " But , " she said . " You 've just told them at the desk we 're leaving . And they 'll have the bill . .. " " That 's all right . It wo n't make any difference to them . I have to pay for us anyhow for a second day  --  giving notice after twelve noon makes it another clay . " " I see . " " So we might as well stay tonight . Then we can pack off tomorrow . " " That does sound sensible , " she said . There was a silence that became too noticeable . Ile got up and walked the room . " Well , " he said . " That 's decided . Now , we might as well eat . Shall we cat here  --  or downstairs ? " " I could n't stand either . " " I see . " He paced the room . Then he sneezed . She laughed irrepressibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I20 " Perhaps your father was right , " he said . " It does n't matter . " He paced the room again , and then snapped his fingers . " I 've got an idea . Let 's go out and have a good drink . We need a good slug of something  --  it 'll be good for the colds . It 's no use our going different ways with the same cold . We 'll have a drink  --  and then a good dinner . A farewell dinner . We 'll find a place somewhere . . . " " It might be a good idea , " she said . She got up and they went down the stairs . Almost at the entrance they heard the clerk . " Mr. Briggs ! " He came hurrying over . " Your bill  --  and if your luggage is ready . " " Luggage ? " Clive said . His mind had been far away . " Oh yes . Well  --  never mind the luggage now . We 've decided to stay over tonight . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's right . Send the bill up tomorrow morning , and we 'll take care of it then . " The little man ducked away , his forehead wrinkled . " Funny little man , " Prue said . " Now , where are we going ? " " We 'll find a good place . There 's got to be one good place in this town . " The inn was low-ceilinged , dimly lit , with highlights glowing softly on the age-polished wood . Clive stood at the door and lifted his hands and looked at Prue in an expression that said : " Is n't it simple ? reclining years , " he said . They stood by the door , watching the plump , white-aproned man bustling to the fire . He lifted the blaze in the high-hobbed hearth into a good glow . He put on more coal with a small pair of tongs . Then he turned to a table by the hearth and spread his hands in invitation . He did all this without speaking . As they sat , he waited , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , finally . " What shall it be ? " " Well , something to take the chill off , " Clive said . " We 've got posthymenealcolds . " " What 's them ? " " It does n't matter . A medical name . " I2I " I see . How about a hot mulled special ? " " What 's that ? " " Ah , now , sir . You just leave that to me . It 'll have you warmed up in no time . " Clive watched him bumble away down the steps to the bar . " Obliging cove , " he said . " He 's sweet , " Prue said . " Like mine host . " " That 's it . Probably read it in a hook . " " No . Give human nature credit for being human . " " I do . What I mean is that he 's merely conforming subconsciously to the popular imagination of what he is . We all do that . " " Do we ? " " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared into the fire , feeling comfortable and happy at last . " You know , Prue , " he said , " we 're all living under the chains of conformity . Conforming to what popular imagination says we should be . Take a young doctor . He knows what popular imagination says he should be ; how he should walk , talk , dress , act . He conforms and soon is n't what he really is , but a sort of walking , composite creature of what mass imagination fostered by novels and cinemas and plays says he should be . " " Do n't wrinkle your forehead , darling . " " All right . It 's the same with everyone  --  ministers , policemen , actresses , waiters  --  all of us . We 're all supposed to be something . We desertourselves , and live a fake life . And really  --  that 's not us . " " It makes the world smoother perhaps . You 're wrinkling again . " " All right . I do n't think it does . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something truer . We live too many ready-made things . In childhood we start with : a boy is this , and a girl is that . Well , a boy is n't this and a girl is n't that . " " Then what on earth are they , darling ? " " Now do n't fool . I almost have something . " " I would n't fool . You 're so wonderful when you get serious . And you do have good ideas . You 've got a very fine mind . " " Stop it . What I mean is  --  we 're always peering through a false front of what we pretend to be and know we 're not . A Briton is supposedto be this , and a Protestant is that , and a Lancashireman is always something , and an Englishman never does this , and a workman alwaysI22should do the other thing . Popular imagination , lumping us and crowdingus and molding us . " " Sometimes for our good . " " Yes , but too often for bad . Suppose some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A real revolution  --  a revolution of self . . . " He pursued the thought  --  it was like a chase after a fox . The shape and form of what he was racing after could n't be seen . But if he could catch the thought , he might know  --  might know something important . " If all mankind arose and said , I am not a lay figure . I am me . I am not a brave Briton , a reserved Englishman , a stubborn Yorkshireman , a cold Protestant , a sober workman . . . " " Then what are you ? A cowardly Briton , a garrulous Englishman . . . " " No , by the Lord Harry , no . Because I am not one thing , I am not necessarily the reverse . Nationality means nothing , anyhow . Take the British . In France a Briton is perfidious , in America he 's a silly ass with a monocle , in Italy a gaunt , chill , cold-blooded aristocrat , in Germanya bony pipe-sucking child-starver . And we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what are we ? " " Do n't you see  --  we 're all things . Each person is everything in the world if he could only recognize it and admit it . If each man could only say : I 'm brave one moment , a coward the next ; I 'm reserved in parts of me , yet childishly friendly ; I 'm hot and cold about religion as the fears and hopes of the day move inc . I am all things . Each one of us is just me  --  everything  --  humanity . ' " " Yes , darling . Here comes the man with the drinks . " Clive shook his head . He had suddenly understood something  --  yet his words had n't said it . He left thoughts regretfully . The man was saluting him . " Here you are , doctor . And madame . If you 'll try that . " The man watched them as they sipped . Then he rubbed his hands . " Good ? " he asked Prudence . " My , yes . " She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Makes you tingle all over . " " We 'll have another , " he said . " Yes , doctor . " 123The man took the glasses , still clouded with steam , and bumbled away . " He thinks you 're a doctor , " Prue said , " because you said posthymenealcold was a medical term . " " That 's why . You know , I almost had something  --  about popular imagination . Only I did n't get it out  --  express it right . " She put out her hand . " What worries you , Clive ? " " Worries me ? Nothing . " " It 's all right if you do n't want to tell me . But I know there is . " " No there is n't . Tell me about you . What do you think of it all ? " " What all ? " " Everything . Life  --  war  --  love . " She shook her head . " Have you ever been in love ? " he asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . I mean with a man ? " " I do n't know . " " What do you mean , you do n't know ? " " I mean  --  what did Robin say to Makyn : I wot not what is love . ' I wondered whether I had any capacity for it . I grew up  --  maturedslowly  --  but . . . I was engaged once . " " But not now ? " " No . We broke it off . " " Why ? " ? She looked at her hands , and spread the fingers . Then she lifted her head . " It 's curious that I do n't mind telling you . It seems so empty of emotion now . We 'd known each other a long time  --  oh , since before he went up to Oxford . It died and went up and down , and then when he came down from university , it got very serious and we got engaged . ' I'lhen we had a fight and ended it . " " Perhaps yun ' 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fire , and shook her head . " You might , " he said . " I could n't . It 's curious , I do n't mind talking about it now . I thought I 'd never get used to it . You see , he was a C.O. , and we quarreled dreadfullyover it . " " You should n't have . " " What , at a time like this ? You ca n't see a man  --  when things are like 124 1this  --  not being willing to fight . We 've got to fight , that 's all . Everyone ! It 's  --  something bigger than personal feelings . " " So in place of him you joined up . " " Not at all . " " Yes . He would n't go  --  so you did . " " I do n't think so  --  or perhaps that 's true . " " To put him to shame . " " He put himself to shame . " " I do n't think he did . " " You 're a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's not argue , then . I 'm sorry  --  if you feel hurt about it . " " I do n't . " " You do  --  but do n't feel too bad . I 'm sorry I made you talk . " " It 's all right . " She looked at his face , sober and too grim . She laughed , quickly . " Do n't you worry about it , then , " she said . " I do n't . It is n't the end of the world . You can rationalize it that way . There 'll be other loves  --  common sense tells me that . " " Yes , " he said , slowly . " It 's just that the first one is always hardest . " " That was n't my first , " she said . " Do n't try to be sophisticated . I can tell . You always can . " She looked at him , staring in the fire . The place was dim and in itsemptiness somehow conveyed lonesomeness . She smiled to herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've had lots of other experiences . " " I 'll bet . " " I have , really . In Paris . " " You in Paris ! " " Yes , me , " she said . " I had a very daring experience in Paris . " " Very , very daring ? " " Yes , very , very daring . Do you want to hear about it ? " " If you care to tell me . " " You do want to hear , only popular imagination says a man must n't be curious . " " Touche  --  as the chap with the ax said when King Charles ' head rolled into the basket . I 'm all agog . I never was agogger , in fact . What is agog ? " " I do n't know . That was in Paris when I was fourteen . It 's very important in my subsequent development . " " Fourteen . Precocious ! " 125 " Yes . I was walking by the fountain of the Observatoire one day , up beside the Bal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Do n't dazzle me . I do n't know Paris . " " Oh , well . It does n't matter . I was walking , and a man came up behind me . " " Thank you . That 's a very exciting story . " " Wait . I have n't finished yet . I was just trying to see how I could phrase it politely . " " Oh , do n't stand on ceremony to me . " " You ca n't say it politely , anyhow . You see , this man , suddenly , he pinched my bottom . " " The rascal . A bottom-pincher ! " " Yes , and it was a real hard pinch , too . " " Ah , wonderful nation , the French . Good old nation of bottompinchers . Little-girl bottom-pinchers . " " But why do they do it ? " " Just an expression of their good old Gallic courtesy . All Frenchmen are bottom-pinchers at heart . " " Oh , but is n't that popular imagination ? You just said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the French believe it , too . Popular imagination says the Frenchman is n't dull and phlegmatic like the Briton . He is always sexually alert . That 's the popular view . The Frenchman believes it , and tries to live up to it . Maybe he 's overdone it . Maybe that 's why his birthrate is falling . " " Sort of overtrained ? " " That 's it . Look , the Latin nations are supposed to be perpetually amorous cockerels . I doubt whether they 're any more sexually fervent than any other race . I 'll bet that there are plenty of cold-blooded Englishmenwho arc calm in the daylight . But once the lights are out  --  they 'll give a head start to any hot-blooded Latin . " " And the lights are always out these days . " " That 's right . Look for a birth increase here in a year . They wo n't be war babies this time . They 'll call ' em blackout babies . Twenty years from now there 'll be a crop of youngsters  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Oh , I was a blackout baby . ' " " You think long dark evenings help ? " " Could n't be otherwise . In the wintertime there is no fishing . " " Maybe that 's why . . . " " Please . No discussion of present parties . " rah " Why , it never entered my head . " " Then do n't let it . " She smiled to herself . " You know , I never thought I 'd talk like this . It 's quite wicked , talkingvulgarity . " " It 's very natural  --  and when it 's natural it ca n't be vulgarity any more . Let 's talk very properly , then . Do you still think we should play Wagnerian operas during wartime ? " " Silly , " she said . " Here 's Mine Host . " The plump man set the new glasses before them , and watched them as they sipped . " What 's in this ? " Clive asked . The man glowed appreciatively . " Ah , some of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's red wine  --  with some spices . " " Some spices , " laughed the man . His double chin began to shake . " That 's a good ' un , that is . Some spices ! " Shaking his head he waddled away . Clive sniffed and turned to Prue . " He 's seen someone do that on the stage , " he said . " Secretive cove stuff . " " Perhaps it is an old family recipe  --  been in the family for centuries . " " Yes . It was revealed to his great-great-grandfather by an Indian chieftain out of gratitude for saving the chief 's daughter from an attack of chills and ague . " " Where did you get that ? " " From a bottle . When I was a kid my mother used to make me take some stuff called swamp-root elixir , and that 's what it said on the bottle . " " What did it cure ? " " Everything . Corns , warts , bunions , scars , scarlet fever , tic , rheumatism , sciatica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But that 's just it . If the Indian had such a wonderful recipe for curing chills and ague , why did n't he cure his own daughter ? " " Ah , that 's it . He saveth others , but himself he can not save . Anyhow , it 's an important question . I think it should be asked in Parliament . " " I feel very happy . " " That 's fine . So do I. " " I like this place . It 's good luck to us . We do n't quarrel here . " " Quarrel ? We do n't quarrel . We merely differ . " 127 " All right , " she said . " Just we do n't differ here , then . Did you take your medicine like a good little boy when you were small ? " " I knew I 'd better  --  or I 'd get my bottom smacked . " " Your bottom . You know this man ... " " What man ? " " The man in Paris  --  by the Bal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he in again ? He seems to have been important in your life . " " I 've led a very exemplary life . " " Until now . " She smiled , and stared at the fire . " Poke it up a bit , " she said . He got up and stirred the coals . They sat silently , sipping the hot wine . " There was one curious thing I have n't told you about , " she said . " I thought so . Well , go on . Confess . " " Well , this man . . . " " Which one is this ? " " The same one . " " The bottom-pincher ? Persistent duck . Wo n't keep out of our lives . Go on . " " Well , this man . .. " " You met him again , eh ? " " No , this was the same time . You 're making it hard for me . " " If you were a man you would n't make gauche remarks like that . Better get back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " After he pinched me , I turned around , and he  --  he had his trousers open . " " Right 1 ) y the Bal fluffier ? " " Yes . Right in daylight . " " Well , the old showoff ! What slid he do then ? " " I e  --  I do n't know how to phrase it . I lc made  --  lewd and lascivious gestures . Is that right ? " " Perfect phrasing . So what did you do ? " " Well , when he nipped me , of course , I jumped . Then when I whirled round , and saw he was " " Revealing all ? " " That 's it . Well , I got so angry , I swore and shouted at him . . . " " You must have had a good command of French at fourteen . " 128 " No . I shouted in English . " " How insular . " " Well , I was so stunned , I could n't be bothered to think in French . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , but did n't he just . He understood all right , because I punched him right in the face . " " I see , entente cordiale stuff . Then what ? " " Then he ran . " " Without buttoning his trousers ? " " Without waiting for anything . He ran just as fast as his legs would carry him , and I ran after him , just shouting at the top of my voice , and telling him just what I thought of him . It was a terrible scene  --  going right down through the little park of the Observatoire , and nursemaids and people passing ... " He bowed himself in his chair , and began choking . " I did , " she said . " It 's true . " " My God , " he said . " It 's too marvelous . There should be a painting of it to symbolize the relationship between the two nations . Youthful British virginity incarnate , outraged , and chasing one fearful little Frenchman through the streets of the city of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigtails flying  --  and all the good French nursemaids staring in total incomprehension as they see only a foreign young hussy so avid for one of their fine French men that she chases him in open daylight through the streets .

Well , here 's to good old British womanhood . Drink up . How do you feel ? " " Very , very pleasant . " " We 're very nice people , " he said . He stretched his feet to the fire , feeling warmly happy . " Clive , " she said , finally . " Yes ? " " What do you think made him do it ? I 've always wanted to ask someone . " " Who ? " " You know . The bottom-pincher . " " My God , is that fellow in again ? 7What about him now ? " 129 J " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh , but there 's something quite terrible about it . I tried to look it up in father 's books  --  I told you , he 's a doctor . But I could n't find anything . . . " " Maybe you got the wrong book . " " Yes . And you ca n't really talk about it to anyone . " " That 's right . It 's perversion . You 're not supposed to talk about it in mixed company . " " I know . But the thing is , one is supposed to know . And we do n't know . We go on  --  girls like me , you know  --  pretending we know , and all the time we do n't . " " None of us do , really , " he said . " We 're all sophisticated and hand- painted exteriors wrapped around a quivering sort of frightened curios- ity about life . Everyone is . " " That 's true . But what makes people suddenly do such frightful things ? What happens in a man 's mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know . They have a name for it . Not exhibitionism . Some- thing else . The name does n't matter . Being performed by a human being  --  it 's human . Perhaps he was hungry  --  for love , physical love , He was fighting for it as blindly as a sperm rushes at an ovum . He was a warped poet , repelled by nature 's falling below his imagination . It does n't matter . All that matters is that he 's human . " " It 's terrible , though . " " No , it is n't terrible . It 's in all of us . Good and bad , right and wrong  --  all mixed in every one of us . All the evil in the world lives in me . And all the good , too . The potentialities of all the world are wrapped in each one of us . They 're all there , in this vessel of ourselves  --  and they lie there always , waiting to see what circumstances and life will evoke . Give us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come forth . Give us a bad set of circumstances , and all the evil and cruelty can come rushing forth , to go marching on to pillage and rapine and bombing cities and slaughtering innocents in a manner that seemed impossible . Cruelty , evil , perversion  --  it lies in all of us , waiting for opportunity to become dominant . " " I 'm glad normality 's dominant in me , right now . " " May I not say , madame , that I 'm awfully glad you 're normal , too . " " Thank you for handing out compliments . " " Do you like them ? " " Should I answer ? " " I 'll give you another , then . I 'll give you all the compliments in the world , wrapped in one compliment . I hereby give you words , and words , and words , and words . " " What does that mean ? " " It means these drinks are good . " " Nothing else ? " " Lady , it also means that I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poets of all the ages have tried to put into all their poems . Only they did n't dare come out and speak plainly , because they 're poets . So they veiled the truth behind these words which have certain rounds and rhymes .

I still think a lady would rather have a poem . " " Poems are no good  --  not love poems . Nobody writes a true love poem . " " Why not ? " " Because no one dares to . There 's a curious dishonesty in life and art , and poetry is built on dishonesty . You know what all the love poems in the world tried to say and did n't ? The poets tried to tell one eternal truth and got lost in their medium . " " What is this eternal poetic truth , master ? " " A simple truth . That of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor beautiful , nor poetic , nor exultant thing than a man and woman who truly love each other in bed together . " If we could only say that clearly , and understand it , and teach children it  --  we 'd clear out all this wickedness of present morality  --  our cinemas and songs and novelettes could no longer warp mass minds with their smirking behind barrages of leers and smut and false immoralities . " And that 's what all the poets of the world have tried to say  --  and have never said . " " My , " she said . " These must be wonderful drinks . " He smiled slowly . " I get deeply philosophical , and you blame it on the drinks . " " No , " she said . " I 'm fighting for time . in face of a rather big idea . You really , underneath the kidding , believe all that , do n't you ? About poetry  --  and two people making love ? " " It 's one of the things I believe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes . It 's true  --  if two people are very , very lucky . " She stared at her glass . " Clive . " " Yes ? " " Are we  --  very , very lucky ? " " You ca n't tell at first . I think in that way we are . But I do n't know you . I can only tell my part . Do you think  --  we 're lucky ? " She looked at her hands , and sought for words . " I think it 's true what you said  --  about poetry , " she said , slowly . " It 's hard to understand  --  the whole thing is , is n't it ? " " Yes . Thinking about it does n't help sometimes . Let 's not worry about it . I 'll do the worrying for two . " " Clive . " " Yes ? " " What is worrying you ? " He looked up from the fire quickly . " Nothing , " he said . " Nothing 's worrying me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two of us . " " Who 's the tertium quid ? " " Jean Jacques Pince-Derriere . Let 's keep him out of this . " " All right . But we 'll drink to him . " " That 's right . To absent friends . I 'll order another drink . " ' But we ought to eat , too . " " One drink , and we 'll go eat . " " Clive , let 's not go back to that hotel . Ask him if he can give us something to eat here . It 's so comfortable . " " That 's an idea . " " Bang on the table . " Ile thumped his glass , but the place sounded empty . " I 'll go find him , " he said . I.Ie went over the stone-flagged room . She watched him go , and then stared at the lire . She started abruptly , then pulled the seams of her stockings straight . She crossed her legs and folded her hands on her lap and waited . Clive came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just leave it to him . Competent cove . " " Yes , " she said . " Clive , are you married ? " " Just like that . You should give warning . " 132 l " Are you married , or something ? " " Neither . I 'm not married , nor I 'm not or something . " " That 's nice . You know what I 've been planning ? " " To learn to play a trombone . " " No . I 've decided to buy you a dressing gown . You know , you do need one . " " I ca n't think of anything I need less . " " Oh , but you do . You ca n't go round wearing that mackintosh for a dressing gown forever . " " Mine Host was in the war . He was telling me . Has the Mons Star . " " With your bare legs sticking out . You looked so funny , this morning , following the old crone out with your upper part so military and smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out below . I see now why men wear long trousers  --  male legs certainly are n't the handsomest part of them . " " Nor delighteth he in the shape of any man 's legs . That 's the Bible . But you note , it does n't say what God thinks of female legs . Which shows that the Bible is a purely male creation . " " I 'm still going to buy you a dressing gown . A nice one . Then you can parade down the hall like a thing of masculine beauty . " " My God , it is a parade , too . If I were in full pack I 'd call it a fair route march . " " Oh , and that bathroom . It 's so big it feels like taking a bath in Covent Garden or Crystal Palace or something . " " You could do the backstroke in the tub . " " It 's funny . Bathrooms should he small , should n't they . Why ? " " Conditioned reflexes or something . False morality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just to set off your liquid brown eyes . A very pretty blue . " " If I pass a man in the hall he 'll tip his hat to me . " " There 's no danger of that . You wo n't pass anyone in that hall . " " By God , yes . That hotel 's empty  --  except for auntie . " " Let 's forget her , too , " she said . " The whole town 's empty . It 's all empty . As if everyone 's hiding silently in the cellars , waiting for something to happen . And we 're strange sinners who walk around on top , alone . " He fell suddenly silent . " What 's the matter ? " she said . " Did I say something to upset you ? " He looked up , and his face cleared and he smiled 1331 " Eh ? It 's all right , " he said . " I wish he 'd hurry that food . " She turned her chair slightly so that they both faced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the blackness , feeling someone near , and then realized she had been shaking him . " What is it ? " " The teeth , " she said . " You were making that horrible noise . I 'm sorry . You told me to wake you . " He lay stiffly , listening to her go back to her own bed . He heard the whisper of bedclothes and the sound of her lying down . He lay , looking upwards into the dark , listening to her breathing . He wondered if she were going back to sleep . Then he heard her speak , softly , as one does when not sure whether the other is awake or not . " Clive ! " " What 's wrong ? " " Nothing 's wrong . I just wondered  --  are you sleepy ? " " I do n't know . Just breathe steadily and you 'll go back to sleep . " He lay quietly , and now his wide-open eyes began to see shapes of the room , the dim angles of the wall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window . He heard her breathing , but he knew she was awake , and he knew she would speak again . He waited with the mounting minutes . And then it came : " Darling . " " Yes ? " " Are you sleepy ? " " No . What is it ? " " Tell me about you . " " I 've told you . " " No. ( there things . You 're in the army  --  and you 're on leave ? " " That 's right . " " Why did n't you go home for leave ? " " Home ? I have n't a home . " " But your people . Have n't you any people ? You must ... " " I do n't . My mother died several years ago . " " I 'm sorry . Is your father dead , too . " " Oh yes . Ile 's ( lead . " " Oh , bad luck . What did you do in the army ? " " I told you . I 'm a rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why are n't you something higher ? You could be , you know . " " I did n't want to be . I liked it where I was . You meet a better class of people . " " What were you in ? " " Infantry . " " What regiment ? " " Oh , what does it matter ? Why the cross-examination ? " " Do n't get angry , darling . Only I know so little about you  --  and  --  I get wondering . All your life stretching back , and it 's a long road of mystery . I begin to wonder what made you and why . " " I 'm not angry . Go on and ask . " " I wo n't if you do n't like it . Only I wonder . What did you come down here on leave for if your home 's up North ? " " This is as good as any other place , when you 've no relatives , is n't it ? " " Oh , yes . " She lay quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " You wo n't get very angry if I ask you a question , will you ? " " How can I tell till I hear the question ? " " Well  --  I 've got to ask you . Are you a coward , Clive ? " He laughed suddenly , and the spasm held him . IIe laughed until the bed shook . " Good God , woman , " he said . " What a schoolgirl question . " " Well , are you ? " " Of course I am . Every man 's a coward . Why do you ask ? " " Oh , nothing . " " It must have been something . " " Well , just the things you mumble and groan when you 're asleep . And you shout . " " What ? " " Oh , all sorts of things . You were saying : Come on . Come on ! You do n't want to die here ! ' That 's one thing you say . And then : There are n't any more . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . Any more what , Clive ? " " How can I tell ? I do n't know what I 'm doing in my dreams , do I ? " " But you keep on saying it . Any more what ? " She could hear his breathing . " Bombs , " he said . " Bombs . " " You mean air raids ? Is that what you dream about ? " " No . Not that kind of bombs . Hand grenades . " " Oh , I see . Are you a bomber ? " " No . Monty is . " " Oh , the chap you 're going to meet in London . " " Yes . I 've told you about him . " " But why do you keep saying there are no more ? " " Because there were n't . " She lay still a while . Then she said : " Were you in France ? " " Hell , I 'm on leave , " he said . " I came here to forget the army for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He lay quietly and listened to her breathing . He could not tell whether she was sleeping . He listened , carefully , through the long , dark time . His ears heard her breathing . Beyond that sound was the rush and thump of the sea , so ever-present that the ear ignored it unless consciously prompted . Near by was his wrist watch , ticking furiously on the lamp table between their beds . Beyond that was a faint droning . He lay quietly a long time , and then his mind began sifting gently away . But it leaped back to awareness , and he knew he had heard a sound that meant she was sitting up . " What now ? " he said , angrily . " Hush , " she said . " Planes ! " " Oh , go to sleep , " he said . " I heard them long ago . They 're ours . " " How do you know ? " " By the sound . " " But how can you tell all different kinds of planes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . You can hear his and hear ours . You get to know . " " You were in France , " she said . " I knew it . Why did n't you tell me ? " " Oh , go find somebody who likes to get hemorrhage of the mouth about it . Now let 's get some sleep . " She lay listening , as the drone of the planes came nearer . There was a sweet throatiness in their song of unison . The planes passed overhead , and then droned away inland . " They 're on their way home , " she said . " That 's so . Now you can go to sleep . " She lay quietly a long time , and then she said : " It 's very funny . " 136 " What is ? " " Well , those planes . Suppose it had really been a raid . Supposed I 'd been killed  --  in a hotel under an assumed name with a man . Then what ? " " Then we 'd be dead and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's true , " she said . " Do you like double beds ? " " They 're all right . Double beds for the double life . " " I think a big bed is much nicer than twin beds . " " We must go into it all some day when we 've more time . We 'll discuss wallpapers , too . And our tastes in carpets . " " Do n't be sarcastic , dear . " He sighed , and turned on his side . He waited with mounting tension for her to speak again . Then he heard her voice , going rather quickly . " I do n't want to be a nuisance , darling . But  --  please ! Let 's move the beds together . " He threw back the clothes , feeling a mounting hysteria of laughter . " Stay there , " he said . " I 'll shift the lamp table and push mine over to yours . " He began unplugging the lamp from the socket . Suddenly he stopped in the dark . " By the Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done some balmy things in my life . But I 've never got up and moved furniture around in a hotel at three in the morning . " " It ca n't be three , yet . " " It 's long after three . " " Well , no one will hear us . " " That 's one thing you can bet on . By God , there is n't another soul in this blasted edifice . Now ! Is that better ? " He got back into bed . He felt her outstretched hand reaching across on the covers . " Now , " she said , happily . " We can go to sleep , and if you get dream- ing bad  --  well , I wo n't let you . " " Ah , nuts , " he said . " Do n't be rude , darling . " " Then go to sleep . " " I will , now . Truly . You 're very patient with me . " " Go to sleep . " " You are . Beautifully patient . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay , listening , until his breathing came evenly and steadily. 1371CHAPTER X VITHERE was a clean , washed feeling to the air that came even into the lobby of the hotel , and the morning had a feeling of cheerfulness . He looked up , hearing the sound of the lift door opening . She came to him , smiling . She glanced toward the desk and nodded , and then took his arm . They swung gladly onto the street . " What makes you so happy ? " she said . " Nothing . I have n't a headache this morning for a change . " " You sneaked into the bar and had a drink , you mean . " " I did n't . I had one from the bottle before I came down . I was just laughing at the little twirp behind the desk . He was really so upset . " " About us ? " " Yes . About the bill . He said : It 's all ready , Mr. Hanley . ' He seemed so damned tickled about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you 'd think I 'd ruined a work of art . He was quite upset . " " Oh , that 's so . We told him we were leaving this morning . I forgot all about it . " " You liar , " he said . " You did n't forget any more than I did . " " Of course , " she said . " Unpleasant things  --  you just put them off hoping something happens to forestall them . " " Mental laziness , " he said . " Well , it 's very comfortable  --  and it often works . In this case it did . " " Well , we were idiots  --  to get angry and say we 'd do it . " " That 's right , " she said . " We wo n't get angry at each other any more . Now , where do we go ? " " Well  --  we can go on the clifftop ! " 138 " That 's nice , " she said . " We 'll sit up there , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They walked along , feeling a sudden sort of holiday aura about the deserted town . The wind came in from the sea , bringing torn swatches of clouds that hurried along , making the sea and land an unfolding quilt of occasional shadow and sunshine . The day was warm . Seagulls strutted calmly on the edge of the forsaken sands . On the clifftop there were tiny , pearl-shelled snails on the grass stems , and many blue butterflies . The larks lifted themselves and sang from their hiding places of height , and the sounds of their song came clearly above the background of surf cannonading against the chalk faces below . They walked far over the cliffs to a slope that looked seaward , and there they lay in the thick , dry grass . He lay with his head on his clasped hands and looked upward , and she sat , looking over the Channel . " It 's nice , " she said . " We 're very lucky . " " This is my idea of a holiday , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Now who 's getting a bawdy mind ? " She laughed in a sort of happy embarrassment . " You said last night it was poetry , " she said . " So it is . But talking about it is n't  --  not always . " She lay quietly for a while , and then turned and studied his face . " You 're wrinkling again , " she said . " It 's force of habit . " She moved a finger across his forehead . " Clive . " " Yes ? " " Will you tell me about something ? " " What about ? " " About the war . About being in France . " " Oh , hell , let 's forget it . " He turned over , face down . She looked at him , studying the line of the nape of his neck . " You see , " she said . " I want to know about you . " " That 's feminine possessiveness . " " Well , if I 'd been at the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone who asked me . " " Yes . You 'd be a big-mouthed hero . " 139 " There 's a difference between boasting and telling . What was it like ? " " Oh , Jesus , you wo n't be satisfied until you pry it out of me . It wasa bloody do . Now that 's it . It was a damned , bloody do . Now you know . " " Were you in it ? " " What the hell do you think I was doing ? Taking tea with the general staff ? " " Whereabouts were you ? " " All over . All over . " " Where ? " " How the hell should I know ? " " Well , if you were there , . . " " You do n't know . You 're too bloody tired to know or give a damn whether you do or not . At first you knew , but afterwards you did n't . You did n't know anything except that you wanted to go some place and sleep for ten clays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He raised himself on his elbows , and looked at her . " All right , " he said angrily . " You wo n't be satisfied until you have it out of me . I 'll tell you . If you want to know , I 'll tell you , and then you 'll have it . You 'll have all I 've got . " He looked down at the grass , and plucked the stems , carefully . " This is all there was to it , and nothing more . We were at a place called Hersin . We 'd been there months , waiting . They sounded fall in , full pack , and we lined up and started off . Monty said the Corporal told him the Sergeant-major had heard the Captain telling the Lieutenant that Jerry was coming through Holland and Belgium . " So much for the tactical situation . Three cheers were nobly given by our enthusiastic troops who were fed up with waiting , and off we went . " We marched . We got on a train somewhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got off . We ate . We got in motor lorries , all except the transport . That was to follow by road . " We went in the lorries through places called , I think , Quivrain and Quivrechain . Anyhow , it was a pottery district . Then we were in Belgium . You could tell it by the flags . The people hung them out . They were very happy . Everyone was happy . The chaps in the lorries sang : Adolf , you 've bitten off much more than you can chew . ' That 's how happy they were . " That was all right . I wo n't mock . We 'd been waiting too long . We 'd 140done our part in the ranks . We were tired of waiting . We were glad it had come . " We rode till about noon and got out . We waited there . We got hungry . The transport was supposed to catch up with us  --  cookers and things like that . I do n't know . Anyhow it did n't come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After that  --  let 's see  --  oh , busses came back some time about then and picked us up again . We rode till about midnight . No one was singing any more . We got out and flopped down . My platoon was in a barn somewhere . The farmer gave us hell for taking his straw to sleep on . " Next morning when we got up  --  it was a village . The refugees had started coming . One of our cookers got up and we had hot tea . The others never found us . The refugees were too heavy on the road . That 's what they say . " We marched again that clay . We could hardly get through the refugees . They came down the road with pushcarts and wheelbarrows and perambulators  --  anything on wheels . The damned upper classes were coming through in motorcars , and honking like hell to get the others over to the side of the road . " We had a hell of a time getting through . You ca n't push them off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even when you want to march you ca n't shove them into the ditch . So we went in the ditches , sometimes Indian file . We just kept on slogging that day . About dark we stopped at a place and ( lug in . Then we marched back about ten kilometers in the night , and we dug in again . " We got dug in by about daylight , so then they sounded fall-in again , and we started up the road once more . " The refugees were saying : Allemandes toute suite . ' We said : Bonnes nouvelles . ' We went past the first place we 'd dug in , then they told us to dig in again . The one cooker kept coming right with us and made some hot stew . That cook was a good man . He kept up with us somehow . " Then the dive bombers showed up and left souvenirs . Chaps picked up splinters . They were quite hot . But most of us fell asleep . Old Monty had dug a sort of tunnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it was going to be worse later . " He was right . We woke up in the afternoon , and Monty and I went down by the road . The last of the refugees were going past . Some of them had been hit . Jerry was strafing the road with his dive bombers. 141 1They were saying : Les sales boches . ' One woman was carrying a dead kid with its arm torn off . They said they could n't get it away from her and that she 'd gone balmy . I think she was . " We stayed there all that day and nothing happened . That night we stood to  --  two hours on , four off  --  and nothing happened . About ten in the morning a bunch of the Guards came back down the road . " We knew they 'd been through it . You . could tell  --  the way they looked  --  their clothes and their faces and the walking wounded . When they saw us , the officer called them to attention , and they went down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front . They were wounded and filthy but they went past us as if we were dirt , like the Guards always do . " After that everything was quiet . No more refugees . " Monty and I went in his funk hole . We were sitting nice till the dive bombers came again . Then Captain Allen came down and found Monty  --  they were both in the last war together . He said someone had to go back and try to find the cookers and guide them up . He had a Sergeant , but because Monty was an old-timer , he thought Monty could look after the Sergeant . He detailed us to go with the Sergeant , and he winked and said : And we want food . ' " So we went back , and walked over about half of Belgium . We lost the Sergeant and a kid named Baker . We were supposed to meet at a crossroad later , but we never saw them again . Then Monty swiped a wagon and we got some grub . God , it was funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to lie down and die . Monty said : I 'll be damned if we go back without food . ' " And by God , we did n't . He saw a wagon by a picket line of the Engineers , and just walked in and harnessed up the wagon , and started to drive away . As we were coming out , a sentry said : Where you going ? ' And Monty says : General orders , ' and while the kid was puzzlingit out , we were down the road and going hell for breakfast . Some time  --  oli , long after dark  --  we found a ration dump . We did n't have any requisition , and we had a hell of a time . Monty said we were from brigade headquarters , and if we did n't get any food he 'd like to have a chit from the Captain explaining why we 'd been refused . The Captain went in to call up somebody , and while we were waiting , we loaded the wagon with anything  --  a Sergeant came along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We put on everything  --  cheese , jam , bread , sides of 142 1bacon . Anything . Then we jumped up and rode away as if hell was after us . " After that we went damn near all over all the part of Belgium we had n't covered already , trying to find our way back . Just after daybreak we saw a spire , and Monty said it had been to the right of us . I thought it had been to the left . But Monty was right , and we found the place , but they 'd pulled out and there was no one there . So we headed for the village where the spire was , and that was empty , too . It was like dead . We drove down the main street  --  all the stuff was in the shops , but there was no one there . And then suddenly a Lieutenant of the Coldstreamers came marching down the street . He had his gloves on and had a walking stick , and he said : " Hello , by God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " So we turned round and left him all alone in his village with his gloves and cane complete . Monty said it looked pretty obvious that the front had moved back , so we started back , and about noon we found the outfit at a new place where they 'd dug in . " We turned over the grub and went to sleep . After that we went back about ten kilos more , and dug in again . " Jerry did n't give us much time and the Stukas came over again . This time they did it right . After dark we piled the wounded in the wagon we 'd foraged , and started them back . About midnight , maybe , we got a stand-to , and we moved back again and dug in . There was about a foot of topsoil , and after that , chalk . It was bad going . " Stukas found us bright and early , and the leader would tip his wings over , and dive  --  and then the next one right after him  --  a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then right back for home to load up honey again . We could n't get our casualties out . " Old Monty found a machine gun and set it on a post and tried to pot them as they came down , but we did n't get any . But three of our Bristols came over , and the Jerries cleared away like magic . Then the minute the Bristols were gone , the Stukas were back again until dark . Then we pulled out again and went back further . We were supposed to dig in again , but no one did much digging . A chap would be standing beside you , digging , and all of a sudden you 'd hear : Clunk ! Like a whole ironmongery shop falling  --  from his equipment . Just go : Clunk ! And he 'd be out . They 'd be asleep before they hit the ground . They 'd just groan a bit and then lie there . You could kick ' em , or drag ' em out of your way , but you could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so they put out pickets . Captain Allen picked on us . I had to laugh . He said : I 'm sorry you 're for it , Monty , but they do n't seem to make them like they did in the old days , Monty . They get sleepy . ' Monty said : Captain  --  did you ever see a dream walking ? Well , I did  --  and it 's me . ' We got posted in a barn and took turns falling asleep . " After that  --  well , we went back some more . By God , we went back  --  clear on through the Guards that had gone through us before . So this time we treated them like dirt , and went right back through without looking at them . " After that  --  oh , what the hell . You get the general idea . Much the same , and more so . " Clive looked at a piece of grass he was shredding . Ile threw it aside and looked out over the ocean . " No , go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You might as well go on now . " He laughed quickly . " Yes , " he said . " Now you 've got me doing it , too  --  fighting the war with my mouth . No  --  it 's no use talking . " " Please , " she said . " Go on , now . It might be good for you if you told someone all about it  --  then you might get rid of it . " IIc turned and looked suddenly at her , looking steadily as if he were seeing a stranger . Then he laughed . " I 've told you . We dug in and marched back and dug in and marched back  --  till finally , till finally we 'd marched clean to hell out of France . " He looked up and saw her with her lips curiously parted . " Did n't we ever hold him ? " she said . Hcr tone sounded so plaintive . He looked down at his hands , and laughed quickly . Then he said : " Oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They did at Douai . The Guards cracked him at Douai . We were on the flank . They said the French were coming up fast to help us . You could hear the Guards yelling over on our left  --  like a crowd at a football match . When they were going over  --  rushing sonic strong point . " We kicked him to hell out of Douai and kept on going way beyond and had hint running , and , Jesus , you began to think that at last it was the miracle and we were going to have another first battle of the Marne all over again . " But first thing you know they 're ordering us to retreat to the town 144again , to try to link up with our chaps in Arras  --  and next thing we know it 's hang on to Douai in a defensive action  --  and finally it 's hold Douai in a rear-guard action  --  hold it to the last man ! Die at your posts , boys ! The chaps at Arras were trying to fight their way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Douai to keep a road open for ' em . " I had to laugh . Captain Allen came crawling up  --  we were down behind the brick part of what had been a hothouse in a back garden  --  and he said the orders were no one was to retreat  --  for the honor of the regiment . Then he said : Here 's your chance for a cross , Monty . ' " Monty says : Victoria or wooden ? ' " ' What do you care ? ' Allen says . You 've got to die to get either . ' " It 's curious how you remember odd bits that people say . " ' Well , old soldiers never die , ' Monty says . And you ca n't tell . Maybe those frog bastards will break through to us . ' " You must n't call them those frog bastards , ' the Captain said . In future they are to be referred to at all times as our gallant allies . ' Then they both laughed  --  it was an old joke  --  about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So  --  we were the glorious rear-guard boys . " He sat , fraying the piece of grass . " And what then ? " she asked . " And what then ? " he said . " Oh , after Douai we cleared out of  --  oh , a hell of a lot of places  --  all the way up to Dunkirk , and then we got to hell out of that . That 's all . " " But , " she said , " but  --  why did you leave Douai if they told you to stay to the last man ? How did you . . . ? " " I ran to hell out ! What the hell did you want me to do ? Stay there and get shot to hell as I sang : Oh , let me like a soldier fall ' ? Stay and be nice fertilizer for some French farmer ? Not me ! " She listened to his voice , lifted angrily in the great space of the flat land on the cliff top . " I meant , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Douai ? Did you lose a lot of men ? " " What the hell ! You do n't expect a rear guard to come marching outon parade front with the regimental band playing , do you ? " " Do n't get angry , Clive . You should be proud , not angry . " " Proud  --  angry ! That 's got nothing to do with it . " " Well , then you must n't feel badly . There 's nothing wrong with an145t , army retreating when it has to . In a way it was even glorious  --  a victoryin defeat . .. " " Oh , do n't talk like a newspaper editorial page . That 's got nothing to do with it . " " Then what has got anything to do with it ? " " Nothing . It wo n't do any good talking about it . " " Why not ? " " It wo n't , that 's all . You would n't understand it . " " I 'm capable of understanding , Clive . I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with your brain . " " Well , what has it got to do with ? " " It 's more than the brain . It 's  --  it 's everything  --  your background . " " There 's nothing abnormal about my background . It would n't stop me from . . . " " It 's middle class  --  that 's all . " She looked at him quickly . " And you 're lower class , " she said coldly . " You pay me a compliment when you call me lower class . You pay me a compliment . " " I 'm glad you appreciate it . " " Well , I 'd sooner be out-and-out lower class than a smug , complacent , crass middle classer . The backbone of the nation ! The overgrownappendices  --  the ossified gallstones of a nation ! " " You 're vulgar . " " It 's the lower class coming out in me . " She sat silently , looking out at the cloud-patched ocean . Then she regarded him , steadily . She said , quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " By God , I am , " he said . " I say it distinctly . Do n't think you 're complimenting me by trying to include me among the pompous , blind , self-centered bastards who . .. " " You are lower class , " she said . " Very low ! " She got up quickly and turned away , waiting . Ile rose slowly and stood beside her . " All right , " he said . " All right . You wo n't have to stick my lowerclassvulgarity very long . Only a couple more days  --  or you can end it now if you like . " " It suits me if it ends now , " she said . 1461 " Then it certainly suits me , " he said . " Let 's go back to the hotel and get cleared out . " " All right . " Unspeaking , they strode back to the hotel , aware of themselves only as two isolated figures in the empty town . He stopped by the desk and told the clerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , sir ? Clive looked at the little , misshapen face . " Of course , " he said . " In the morning . First thing . Have the bill ready . " That night the planes came over . They were very high , and the sound was so faint that the more you listened the less you were able to tell whether it was a sound or the strain of listening that made the hum . Clive lay stiffly in his bed , lifting his head slightly to keep both his ears from the pillow . He lay like that a long time until the strain on his neck destroyed all power of hearing . He lay back again , and then he could hear only the near sounds : the sound of his own breathing , and of his heart beating ; the watch ticking and her breathing , and beyond that the steady flow of the wind and the shattering of the sea at high tide against the Esplanade wall . Then above that he could hear again the humming  --  so faint , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lifted his head again she spoke , ' and her voice seemed suddenly much too loud . " Darling . " " Yes ? " he said . " Do you hear something . " " No . Go to sleep . " " There is something , " she said . " I can hear planes . " " Oh , go to sleep . " She was silent a moment . Then she said , calmly . " There are planes . Is it an air raid ? " " No . They 're ours , " he said . " Now go to sleep . " He lay back again , his eyes open to the blackness . He tried to empty his mind , but now he could not stop listening . Every sound seemed to clamor for recognition . He could hear her breathing , stifled against the pillow . The sound came in gasps . For a long time he tried to shut himself away from the noise . At last he gave up . He leaned on his side. 1471 " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said it as a woman will when there is no denial of it . " You are , " he said . " What 's the matter ? " " I 'm afraid , Clive . " " Afraid . I 've told you , they 're our planes . They 're probably coming home . If there 's a raid .. . " " It is n't that . " " Well , what is it ? " " It 's me , darling . I 'm afraid . I 'm no good . " " Oh , now  --  you 're all right . What 's there to be afraid of ? " " Of me  --  of everything . All I 'm doing . Being here  --  in this dark room  --  in a hotel I do n't know  --  with a strange man . " " I 'm not strange , am I ? " " Not in the daytime , darling . Then everything seems all right . I can see you , and know who we are . But  --  we quarrel  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing , and why I 'm doing it  --  and I 'm afraid . " He waited , and the sound of the planes seemed more distinct . He began talking . " I 'm still me in the dark , Prudence , " he said . " In fact , I 'm a better man in the dark than in the daylight . At least , I do n't fight in the dark  --  and I do n't argue with you  --  and I do n't get evil-tempered and . . . " " I do n't mind , darling . You do n't mean to be , really . You ca n't help being short-tempered , can you ? " " Of course I can help it . I do n't mean to , at the time . Afterwards , I 'm sorry about it . I should n't get so nasty  --  to you of all people . You 're so very patient , and nice . . . " " I 'm not . I 'm no good . " " Oh , yes , you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not , really . You 'd find that out if you knew me very long . " " I wish they were all as good as you . " " All ? Who else do you mean ? " " No one , " he said . " I say , let 's have a drink . That 's what you need . It 'll quiet you clown . " She sat up and drew a breath . " That 's a clever way to duck the conversation , " she said . She listened to his feet slapping on the floor . " Close the blinds before . . . " 148 " I can do it in the dark , " he said . " I know where the bottle is . " She lay , listening to the plop of the cork , and the tinkle of glass , and then the gurgle of pouring . He came back to her in the dark , and put the glass in her hand . " Straight , " he said . " Three cheers . " " Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She drank and then shuddered , and held the glass out at random . His hand found it . " Now you 'll feel better , " he said . He set the glasses on the floor , and his hand found her face . He stroked her forehead . " Now you 'll be able to go to sleep . " She sighed . " That feels so good , " she said . " It 's nice  --  but you 'll get cold sitting there . " " Oh , no I wo n't . " " Oh , yes-you-will . " " I 'm warm enough . " " Look , Clive . Let 's move the beds together again . Then I 'll feel better  --  and you can keep warm . . . " " Oh , my God , " he said . " The Midnight Movers once more . Holy Jesus ! " He got up and moved the lamp table and dragged his bed to hers . He got into bed and put out his hand . She moved over and rested her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now I know you  --  even in the dark . And I like this room , too . It 's very nice . " " Very , very nice ? " " Yes , " she said . " Very , very nice . That makes it different , does n't it ? " " Indeed , " he said . " Comfortable ? " " Yes . Is your arm tired ? " " No . I do n't get tired . Not in the arms , anyhow . " " They are pretty steely , " she said . " I 'm glad . It would have been awful if I 'd got here with you and you 'd turned out to be  --  flabby . Do n't you hate flabby men ? " " Of course , " he said . He lay there , and the sound of the planes seemed to be closer . " I used to be pretty spindly as a kid , " he said , quickly . " I used to read all the strength advertisements . You know  --  our patent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this ! Picture of a gent with lightning bolts coming from his biceps . I used to admire those things . " " Did you try one ? " " No . Never saved enough . " " But you got strong anyhow . " " Yes . " " Your biceps are all right . Triceps too . Pectoral muscles like iron . " " You know anatomy . " " I told you , my father 's a doctor . I was the kind of kid that pried into books . How did you develop your arms finally ? " " Work . A job I had . " " What job was this . Hammering locks ? " " No . A carpetbeater . " " Oh , you have n't told me about that one . Tell me about it . Then I 'll go to sleep . You mean , you went out bright and early every morning , and knocked at the doors , and said : Have you any ... ' " No . This was in a fabrics mill . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear about it . Then that will be something else I know about you . You see , that 's what 's frightening . All your years stretching back when you did n't know me , and all mine stretching back when I did n't know you . Why , we might have actually passed one another on the street . " " It 's quite probable we did , " he said . " Tell me about carpet beating , then . " In the pause he heard the planes . He began , quickly . " Well , it 's piled fabrics , " he said . " You know what piles are . Not the medical kind . The nap on heavy textiles like carpets or plush or velvets and velveteens . Well , after they 're woven , they go to shearing machines  --  they have spiral blades round a cylinder going about three thousand revs a minute , and that cuts the pile off evenly  --  and a few fingers once in a while . . . " " Oh , no . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it  --  it 's quite a normal figure . Industrial hazard number so-and-so . Anyhow , when the carpets are sheared , then they come to you , and you beat them . " " What for ? " " Make the pile stand out , get rid of all the fine bits of dust and pile that adhere . " " You just do that all day ? Why do n't they have a machine ? " 150 J " Hand beating 's best , I suppose . And when you have a job you do n't start wishing for a machine to come and take it away from you . Besides , a machine ca n't inspect for cuts . " " But it could . It could beat , and have a photoelectric cell to check defects , could n't it ? " " I suppose it could . But I was just working there . I was n't the mill owner . " " But if you 'd invented a machine they 'd .. " They 'd have taken it under the employment contract saying all inventionsmade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then they 'd install the machine , say thank you , and lay you off . " " They would n't . They 'd promote you and ... " " You 've been reading soppy stories , my girl . I know . Look , once j when I was a kid , I invented a machine . Well , it was n't a machine  --  it was so simple that it was better than a machine . I was working on an assembly belt . Electrical equipment . The stuff came from the stamper , and they had to have a kid or somebody on the belt , just turning the stuff round for it to go into a drilling outfit . Well , at first I picked each piece up and turned it round . Then I found by sticking my finger out and holding it in exactly one spot , as the stuff came down it bumped my finger and turned in exactly the right position . Well , I did that , but my finger started to get sore . Then I got a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't hold it perfectly steady . So at noontime , I got an old clamp from the scrap pile , and rigged it up with the machine steel in it , and after dinner I horsed it round until I had it set exactly . So there I was , and there was the piece of steel doing all my work for me , and all I had to do was sit there reading and see that nothing slipped . " But when the foreman came round , and saw it ! God you 'd have thought I was a criminal  --  that I 'd been drawing wages under false pretenses . So they left the jigger there to do the job or they rigged aproper one up , and the next Saturday I joined the ranks of the ungainfullyunemployed . " " But you 'd created something . " " Oh , yes . Have you ever tried eating a bowl of creative soup ? " " But  --  in the fabrics mill , did n't you get tired ? How did you beat the stuff ? With carpetbeaters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have a stick in each hand . The stuff 's on a sort of roll-up drum . You just stand there and wallop . " " All day ? " " Of course , all day . " " You beat steadily for eight hours ? " " No . Ten . " " Ten hours ? But I 'd think your arms would drop off . " " No , they stay on all right . " " But do n't you get horribly tired ? " " Lady , you do  --  you do ! " " What do you do then ? " " You go right on beating  --  you have to . The drum is still turning . After a while , your arms build up and you hardly notice it . " " But how boring . " " No , it is n't in one way . You see , it makes no demand whatsoever on your mind , so your mind 's free to go where it will  --  just as if you were sitting before a fire in a comfortable chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What things ? " " Oh , payday , and how you 'll get drunk , and the girl you 're going to make advances to . " " No . " " Why not ? " " You could n't think of that ten hours a day . " " No . You do turn to other things . " " What ? " " Oh , best is complicated things  --  try to do mathematical problems in your head . I once read about two Russian prisoners of war who used to play whole games of chess in their heads . They had n't any chessmen , so they just did it all mentally . So I tried that ? " " Could you do it ? " " No . Only for about ten moves  --  until I 'd get slinging knights about . Once I got to about twenty moves . But the trouble is I knew what each side was after , so I 'd have to start gypping one side to let the other win . So I used to call one side me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's side was very dense . My side would get all sorts of brilliantplays going , and the foreman would n't see it until it was too late . " " Did n't he ever win ? " " No one ever won . I could n't carry it that far . But he certainly was in some awful messes when I left him . " " What else did you think about ? " 152 l " Oh , everything . Politics , economics , who held the heavyweight title from Sullivan down , the books of the Bible . .. " " The Bible ? " " Oh yes . I used to recite it . You see , in my Sunday-school days I had a flypaper memory . Everything stuck to it . And it 's pretty goodsoundingstuff to shout out loud against the roar of machines . Like : For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have everlasting life . John , three-sixteen  --  our promise of eternal life . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me tell thee now another tale , for Bleys our Merlin 's master as they say , died but of late , and when Uther in Tintagil passed away , wailing and moaning for an heir  --  I can do about a half hour straight of that  --  the Birth of Arthur . " " Go on with it . " " No . It 's not good poetry . I only used it for a time counter . See how fast I could do it . Once I did it in three lengths of material  --  that 's about eighteen minutes . " " What else did you do besides gabble poetry for speed records . " " Oh  --  sing . " " Sing ? I 've never heard you sing . " " That shows you what luck you have . " " I 'll bet you sing very nicely , darling . " " Like a raven . But that 's one thing about singing in a factory . You hardly hear yourself above the noise . And it passes time . Around three in the afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nicest way yet to pass the time . " " It is n't nice . It 's very terrible . " " Terrible ? " " You see , it is n't singing over your work . You 're singing against it . You sing when the hours drag and it seems they 'll never end . You sing when stopping time seems miles away . You sing when boredom nearly kills you . The girls start to sing , and everyone picks it up  --  and it 's rather terrible to hear in a way . " " The girls ? Were there many girls employed there ? " " Very many . There 's a high percentage of female labor in textiles . " " What were they like , Clive ? " " Like ? They were  --  girls , that 's all . Like your girls at camp  --  the Waifs . Just like everyone else . " " Did you ever make love to them ? " 1531 " No . " " Truly ? " " I 'd say truly if I had , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't . " " Why not ? " " I do n't know . I think I was  --  frightened . " " Frightened ? Of girls ? " " In a way . " " Why ? " " Oh , many things . " " But you 're not frightened of me ? " " No . That 's different . " " But I 'm just the same as a mill girl  --  for making love to . " " In essentials , I suppose you are . But not in nonessentials . " " In what nonessentials are they different ? " " They 're not very gentle , to begin with . They can be pretty tough . That 's the way it seemed to me when I was young . They can be tough on a new youngster . " " Flow ? " " They gang up on him , and sun him . " " Sun him ? What 's that ? " " Rush him and knock him flat and then sit on him and take his pants down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then get an oil can and oil him up good and rub it in  --  and then let him go . " " Oh , Clive , they would n't . " " All right . " " You 're making it up . " " All right , I 'm making it up . But I 'm just telling you , that 's the way they are . They 're not supposed to be . Nobody ever writes about them like that . They 're either supposed to be unwashed riffraff , or patient , oppressed heroines  --  whichever side of the fence you 're on . They do work hard , and they are patient . But living has made them tough , too . I 'm just telling you the way they are . It 's like  --  like tribal co-ordination . " My God , I have to laugh . People get up expeditions and lug camerasthousands of miles to Africa to film the so-called esoteric and secret rites of jungle tribes  --  initiating the boys into manhood . I saw one  --  there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If ever anyone wanted a grain of truth , and they had the skill , they could go into any mill in any industrial town in Britain  --  or in any other country for all I know  --  and film rites and customs that are exactly as 1541set and dark and ignorant as Africa 's . It 's the same everywhere I 've worked . When people work together in one place , and spend most of their working hours together , they get a sort of code of customs and prejudices , like a tribe . In textiles it 's worse , because the people live and are brought up in tougher surroundings . They do n't mean to be vicious  --  although sometimes they kill people . " " They kill them ! Oh , come ! " " All right . Believe what you want . I 've seen a boy that was killed . " " Killed ? How ? By girls ? " " No . By men  --  and very unpleasantly . " " How ? " " I told you . Unpleasantly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They put the air pressure hose in his anus and turned the air on . In two seconds they 'd ruptured his entire internal system , and he died screaming and in dreadful agony . You could hear him screaming all over the plant . That 's how we knew . We went over to see . " " Clive ! " " I should n't have told you . It is n't pretty , it is ? But do n't misunderstand . They were n't vicious or brutal . They were ignorant . It was the machine age bringing new toys to old customs , and they did no worse with them than mankind has ( lone with airplanes and bomb mechanisms . It was just that they had no conception of the force of an air pressure hose and the relative fragility of human tissue . They were profoundly shocked when they found out . Now , shall we talk about something else ? " She was quiet a moment , and his cars seemed to ring as he listened above the sea sound and the wind sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " were you ever initiated ? " " No . Never . " " I 'm glad . But why not ? " " Because I 've always been fairly active and strong and I can take care of myself . " " But when you 're small  --  what do you do ? " " It does n't matter . You must fight . You fight back desperately  --  and you find strength somewhere . And then  --  well , they learn to let you alone . It 's exactly the same as anywhere else in life . Nobody picks on a chap who can fight back . They learn to leave him alone . " 155She lay quietly , and then she said , suddenly : " Clive , do you think we 're going to lose this war ? " " No , " he said , slowly . " No . " " You 're not saying that just to comfort me . I 'd like to know . You 've been in it . Are we going to lose it ? " " It is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something bigger than that  --  and we 've lost that already . " " What ? " " I do n't know . I wish I were wise enough to know . I try to puzzle it out , but I ca n't . But I ' do know we 've lost it . " " But we 'll win the war ? " " No , " he said . " We wo n't win it . I do n't think we 'll lose it ; but I know we 're not going to win it . " " Why not ? " " Because we 've lost the other thing . " " But what is the other thing ? " " That 's what I do n't exactly know . " She lay quiet , and then he said : " Oh , pay no attention . One 's never optimistic at this time of the night . " " That 's true , " she said . " But it 's nearly morning . Look , you can see the room getting gray . " He listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could be sure of it now . " You 'll be gray if you do n't get some sleep . Now go to sleep . Get back on your own pillow . " He drew his arm away , and heard her settling herself . Then he lay still , listening to her breathing . He thought she was asleep at last , and he began to analyze the strange pleasure he felt in being awake and knowing that she was asleep . But she lifted her head and spoke . " It was terribly nice of you to talk me through it , because I was awfully afraid just at first  --  and they were German planes this time were n't they ? " " Oh , for Christ 's sake , " he said . " Will you go to sleep ! " 156 CHAPTER X VIIPRENTISS SAINTBY rocked contentedly in the sun . There was a smell of heat-baked boards of the porch  --  and the smell of burning pinon wood that drifted up among the pines . The air coming down from the jagged juniper-dotted mountains was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He laughed to himself . So this , he thought , was ranch life ! Somehow he had expected it to be a place of dust and roughing it . Something like the cinema  --  low shacks and a few cowboys sitting on a tumble-down fence . Instead , there was this  --  this heaven : the great log chateau looming up on the green-wooded grounds ; the individual guest houses among the pines , complete with sitting room , bedroom , bathroom of gay orange tile  --  the knotty pine walls , stone fireplaces , vacuum ice flasks and whisky-and-soda siphon on the table , the chintz curtains , and the sprays of fresh flowers in the vases . This was really roughing it  --  right down to the monogrammed towels in the bathroom and the menservants to tend the log fires . He looked at the everlasting wonder of the mountains , and rocked time away . He only wakened from his half-doze when he heard footsteps on the porch . It was the manservant . " Yes ? " " Miss Mary , Mr. Saintby . She asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes . I 'll change and be right down . " The man followed him into the bedroom . " There are flannels in this closet , sir . Or if you wish , I put some shorts down here in the bureau . " " Oh , fine . Flannels . " 157 " Yes , sir . Mr. Lachran said you were traveling light , so I thought . . . " " Good . I 'll be right along . " The man lingered , half-apologetically . Prentiss looked up . " Is there anything . . . " " Well , sir  --  if you 'll pardon me . But  --  how are things at home ? " " At home ? " " Yes , sir . In England . You see , I 'm British , too  --  a Suffolk man . I understand that you 're just over , sir . " " Oh , yes . Yes . Why , we 're quite all right . Quite . You get the news , do n't you ? " " Oh , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how things really were . How we 're getting along . " " Oh , we 're coming along . You know  --  after a slow start . We 're always a bit slow getting started . " " Yes , sir . That 's what  --  if you 'll pardon me  --  I do n't like . " The man went slowly to the door . " If you wish anything else , sir  --  the bell , there . " Prentiss wrinkled his forehead and changed slowly . He was beginning to get used to it  --  people asking him about England as if the real truth were n't being told , as if Britain were hiding something , instead of being open and honest about all news  --  that is , of course , about all news of nonmilitary importance . You could n't expect anyone to give out news that would be of service to the other chap  --  or that would be detrimental to the public morale . Yet everyone here seemed to think Britain was hiding something . He finished dressing , and went slowly down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footbridge across a needle-carpeted gully , along the more formal path beside a great lake . By the boathouse he saw Lachran , playing with two small children . The old man looked up happily and waved . " Getting everything you want ? " " Oh , quite . " " Good . These are my great-grandchildren , " Lachran said , proudly . " We 're running a shipping line . " He held up the water-soaked toy yacht . Prentiss stared at the two youngsters . They were ash blond , fairskinned , with delicate features  --  so physically unlike old Lachran himself in every way . They were  --  were aristocratic . That was it . Il was158 linconceivable that in four generations the rough frontier blood could produce a flesh-and-blood aristocracy . Incredible . " How do you like it here ? " Lachran prompted . Prentiss looked at the lake , its surface a mixture of cool blues and vivid sun-struck greens from the mountains and the near-by willows and sycamores . " Magnificent . How did you manage to find such a heavenly spot ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't exactly like this always . When I first came up here  --  I 'll bet not more than fifty white men had ever been up this canyon . It 's been fixed up quite a bit . This lake was n't here . I put that in . " " You put the lake in ? " " Sure . " Lachran rose . He waved his hand and a uniformed nursemaid came from the boathouse and took the children . It was utterly incongruous  --  the nursemaid with bonnet right out of a London park , walking under the towering tapestry of the Wild West mountains . Lachran was waving his hand expansively . " See , we dammed up there , then we dammed the stream about a mile up the canyon and piped it in  --  fourteen-inch cast-iron pipe . " " Good heavens , " Prentiss said . Lachran laughed gladly at his wonder . " Yeh . Then I put the bridge in . You remember where you came in , up Horseneck Gulch . I spent seventy thousand putting that bridge in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles down the canyon . " " Oh , yes , " Prentiss said . Ile did not remember , but it seemed impoliteto say so . His mind was hanging on the thought of the miles . " You mean , your ranch extends all the way down there ? " Lachran could not have been happier . " Why , we start a couple of miles before that . This is n't your little island , you know . This is America  --  the West . Why , we go further up the other way over the divide there . Then back this way , over the other side of those Sangre de Dios foothills , and round the other side of the Sombrero Mountains . Big Sombrero and Little Sombrero . They 're both my mountains . " " Your mountains ! " Prentiss echoed . " Yeh . Then we built this new ranch house here . We had an old ranch , and Mary liked to come up here . That was my wife . So I fixed it all up . Had an architect come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
