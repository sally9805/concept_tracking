txt Ceilings limiting the total number of workers an establishment may employ will be set in Boston , Fitchburg and Springfield probably within a short time , Arthur C. Gernes , Acting Regional Director of the War Manpower Commission , said here today . Local war plants will also be listed according to the urgency of the demand for their products . Workers will then be encouraged to go into the most critical plants . " We have a shortage of manpower , " Mr. Gernes said , " and the purpose of these moves is to determine which production is most urgent and to get that out first . The plan means rationing the manpower . " No Date Set The ceiling program began in ' New England in central Connec- ' ticut some eight months ago . It was then installed in Hartford , New Britain , Bristol , Waterbury and Meriden . Several months ago it was introduced into Massachusetts at New Bedford . Recently it was put into operation in New Haven , Bridgeport and New Lon , don , Conn. , Portland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , probably very soon , to go into ' Manchester and Claremont , N. H. , and Springfield , Vt . No date has been set for Boston , it is reported at the office of the Area War Manpower Director , Leon . T. Kowal . " The ceilings will be set by the Area Manpower Director following recommendation of a Manpower Priorities Committee , " Mr. Gernes said .

" There is another committee composed of approximately the same agencies which determines the urgency of production . This is called the Modified Area Production Urgency Committee . It knows what the war agencies need first and in what quantities . WMC Committee " The program will come under the general direction of the Management-Labor Committee of the War Manpower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and labor . By this relationship of the two committees , they will be able to direct the war program to the most essential war plants in an area . and also to protect local interests as far as possible , consistent with the war effort . " The type of ceiling may vary with differing communities , Mr. Gernes added . In New Bedford . for instance , the ceilings are based on all employees , both men and women . with a few exceptions such as part-time workers . However , ceilings do not necessarily have to be based on all workers , but can he limited to male employees . If so . a company could employ all the women it wanted . " Under the ceiling program every worker vcill be given as wide a choice of jobs as is consistent with the war effort . " Mr. Gernes concluded . " But the Unit- , I ed States Employment Service will endeavor to guide available work , ers to the war plants where they are most needed . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
