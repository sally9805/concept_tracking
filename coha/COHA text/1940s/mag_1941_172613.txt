A dust-dry little dispatch out of the U.S. Court of Claims last week almost legally proved that Franklin Roosevelt once made a mistake-a thing he has only once publicly admitted ( TIME , June 2 ) . <P> In a 115-page finding of fact , Court Commissioner Richard H. Akers found that there was no fraud in the airmail contracts canceled in 1934 . Mr. Akers almost charged the President with a mistake , but then backed delicately away , leaving final decision to the Court . But one fact seemed clear : the Army need not have taken over the airmail routes ; the deaths of twelve Army pilots were needless . <P> The seven-year-old controversy had almost been forgotten . In 1934 in the midst of a wave of public righteousness Hugo LaFayette Black , then Senator from Alabama with a preternaturally sharp nose for scandals , " exposed " the mail-carrying airlines of the U.S. Black charged that Walter Folger ( " High-Hat " * ) Brown , Postmaster General under Herbert Hoover , had granted lush mail-subsidy contracts to major airlines , had thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The President did not wait to ask questions . He called in Postmaster General Farley , Attorney General Cummings , Secretary of Commerce Roper , Secretary of War Dern . Then he canceled the airmail contracts and ordered the Army to take over the flying of the U.S. mail until a new contract-subsidy system had been worked out . <P> Army pilots suffered the consequences . On the third day of trial flights two pilots were killed in a plane stall in Utah . That night another flew into the ground in Idaho . Less than a week later another boy , with ice on his wings , fell in Ohio . Next day an engine failed over Long Island Sound : one drowned , two injured . At Cheyenne two died when a spitting motor sent a plane into a spin after the takeoff . Another flier broke his neck in an Ohio snowstorm . Engine failure killed a pilot in a Daytona Beach takeoff . Eight days later another plane went into a spin at Cheyenne . Bad weather crashed a flier in Iowa ; a pilot , lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an altitude . <P> The U.S. grew angry with the President and Big Jim Farley . Franklin Roosevelt consulted his Cabinet again , ordered the mail returned to private lines as soon as possible , on conditions barring the " evils of the past . " Last week Commissioner Akers cagily found certain of these " evils of the past " were nonexistent , although he did not settle the spoils charges . He indicated that High-Hat Walter Brown 's seeming collusion- &-conspiracy; policy was an effort to reorganize a chaotic industry . He left the way clearly open for the old companies , since reorganized under new names , to claim damages amounting to about $2,500,000 . He said that the Government had no case . <P> <P> * At a cost of $3,500 , Postmaster General Brown amused the U.S. by turning in his official Cabinet automobile , for a second model with a higher roof so that he could get in &; out without crushing his top hat .                    @
