The purse-proud House Appropriations Committee could not make up its mind about at least one item in the State Department budget-$31 million for the Office of International Information and Cultural Affairs . <P> To the committee members , as to many Congressmen , OIC seemed a windy , posturing , inefficient and expensive peace time version of the Office of War Information-in short , just another unnecessary excrescence of Government press-agentry . They suspected it as a present , or potential , spreader of political propaganda beneficial to the Democrats . Some of the U.S. modern art shows which OIC had thoughtlessly sent abroad still caused House members to flush with mortification . Moreover , Congress felt that any information about the U.S. which the U.S. had to sell abroad could be handled better by private agencies . <P> Anticipating congressional pressure , Assistant Secretary of State William Benton , OIC 's super-energetic salesman , had suggested the establishment of a public corporation-with only nominal State Department control-to take over all U.S. international shortwave broadcasting . But the big question was : Should the U.S. spend uncounted millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time deny OIC the chance to explain it to foreign countries ? <P> Estimate . In 15 months , Benton 's OIC had set up shop in 62 countries , hired 3,100 people , begun to broadcast in 25 languages over shortwave relay transmitters in Manila , Honolulu , Algiers , Munich and London . It had established 70 libraries , started a worldwide service to newspapers , sent mobile units traveling abroad with U.S. art exhibits* and documentary movies-and spent some $32 million . What were the results ? <P> Reports from TIME correspondents showed that the results had been spotty . In Berlin , where the U.S. has to compete head-on with Russia 's Tass News Agency , OIC 's mimeographed press handouts and the " Voice of America " radio program have been far from effective . In Paris , where the Russians maintain a flossy cultural center serving movies , vodka and Martinis , OIC is the object of citywide indifference . Teeming China has not been much impressed , even though the State Department services some 500 Chinese newspapers . And the British dismiss OIC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff that 's usually too late . " <P> But news reports from Russia applauded the news-packed " Voice " program-the only U.S. news service of any kind to pierce the iron curtain . ( Last week , to pep up the broadcast even more , OIC appointed famed Swing Maestro Benny Goodman as musical consultant for programs beamed to Russia. )
