It came from an organization of which the U.S. public seldom hears : the Rhodes Trust . <P> Reason for this unusual break into print was that the Tribune had been bug-eyed for weeks over a private and patently ridiculous bogey : education of U.S. youths in foreign countries . No one was much surprised that the Anglophobiac Tribune saw the greatest menace of all in U.S. students at the great English universities . <P> Rhodes Scholars , solemnly charged the Tribune , are a group of subversive masterminds and intellectual saboteurs banded together in a " secret society " which constitutes a national peril. * Said the Tribune , wheezing with rage : " The Rhodes Scholars , whose education was intended to promote the betrayal of the U.S. , have infiltrated our Federal Government . . . . The Scholarships were created to corrupt Americans . " <P> Among those the Tribune rapped : Arkansas 's Representative J. W. Fulbright , whose plan for postwar international cooperation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Elmer Davis , whom the Tribune accused of having majored in the " tactic of vilification " while at Oxford ; OONR ( a Tribune tag meaning " Old Oxonians Not Rhodes Scholars " ) Marshall Field III ( Eton and Cambridge ) , editor of the Tribune-rivaling Chicago Sun ; OONR Henry R.

Most outrageous ... is the fact that the Tribune has ignored some 250 ( of fewer than 350 of military age ) who are enrolled in the armed services . . . .
