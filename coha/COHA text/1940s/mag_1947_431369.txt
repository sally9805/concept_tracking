I am leaving New York in two months . I have always lived here .  | It is not yet possible to know what I shall feel . I shall be homesick . But for what , exactly ? I am disturbed by the abstract knowledge , and at the same time , maddeningly unable to pin down the practical detail about which something might be done . It is like knowing , while you are packing a suitcase , that you are forgetting something . ( And I always know this . ) But what ? But what ? Handkerchiefs , stockings , hairbrush ? My mind babbles the words while my hands go on smoothing underwear into the bag . I drift absently from station to station of the room , hoping that the forsaken object will cry out to me in time to be snatched up and snuggled into its nest . And if , in the end , it is only something unimportant that is forgotten , only a toothbrush that can be replaced , and not my satin slippers , whose absence will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucky I feel , how I glow with good fortune ! For what shall I be homesick ? For Brooklyn ? No , I think not . Already Brooklyn , where I grew up , has become completely a part of the past . Clear to memory , that is , but framed in the rectangular knowledge that what I remember can only be remembered . Is gone . Gone is the Penny Bridge . Gone , the elms at the end of the street against the sky over the parade grounds . Gone , the block-square grounds of the mansions along Shore Road ? the one where I went to school ( gray stucco and red tile ) , complete with bowling alley , conservatory , built-in pipe organ . And , a few blocks away , the mysterious , Spanish-style , patio-enclosing pile , where lived the lady with the chimpanzees , one of which every now and then would make a break for freedom over the fences and empty streets . The big brown gabled empty house , where the little Japanese irises bloomed each spring . Quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere all about , which now has become a boulevard roaring out to Queens . The primeval ocean freshness of the breeze across the lagoon at Manhattan Beach , and the classic grace of the divers planing down  | from the top of the thirty-foot tower . The empty fields , where I picked daisies along Kings Highway . One winter the streets froze over solid . We skated up the block to the parade grounds , which were dotted with shiny pools of ice . We blew two households ' worth of umbrellas inside out , making iceboats of our sleds . We coasted down the slope in front of the pergola in Prospect Park and fetched up at the iron fence at the foot , with a jar my hands still remember . Late and cold in the dusk I went home , my rigid hands barely able to hold the sled rope , and tag ends of poetry jostling about in my brain . In spring there was the smell of mud and of the valley lilies that grew beside the house in the shade and had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too thick . and thrown away by handfuls . Summer smells were not dusty , but damp , like the green , faintly rotten scent of the park lake . The ice wagons came by . We hitched behind . begging for slivers of ice . The tongs hung on a nail , the ice pick fitted into a slot . The big , slow Percherons nodded their heads as they walked . They wore blue fly nets , The smell of the ice-wet wood was like the lake smell . On the other side of the parade grounds stood two old cannons ? relics of I-don't-even-know-what war . That was a place to go afternoons . To the left , old men played bowls on a velvety-smooth lawn ; and beyond them , streets I halfknew ran off to the unknown , past the Chinese house with its tilted roof . where the gardens showered vines over the edges of the subway cut . Elusive streets . I was never sure of finding what I knew was there . And because elusive , because half-known , the only place I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to . If the Chinese house is not in one block , it may so easily be in the next . I have no sad knowledge with which to deny it . No . Brooklyn is a fever and a dream . a shimmering that proclaims itself mirage . The sea wind off the Narrows tore the words out of our mouths as we rehearsed the plays for June Day . Sherwood , Alcestis . Comus. @#  | " Sabrina , Sabrina fair ? " the organ croons inside , the voices sing . But inaudibly , for the wind has blown them all away . Where is the red-brick house with the round tower and the peaked roof ? I shall never know . I never knew . Brooklyn is packed , you might say , has been packed for years , and ready to travel on . It is in Manhattan that I should go hunting for the lost memories , to label and put away . I will be back often . I need not pack the big things ? not the bridge from the Brooklyn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subway , by taxi , the bridge from one part of my life to the other , which enjoins on the traveler a journey that must follow the beautiful shape of an arc , a bow shot from one shore to the other , under the Argus-eyed skyscrapers of Wall Street . That I shall see again , and so with Park Avenue on an autumn afternoon , the Cathedral , the children skating in the Plaza . And the Zoo , need the Zoo be packed ? Well , perhaps . We know it so well now , and when we go back next year ( on a day when we have gone into town to shop ) , we shall be strangers and surprised . There will be a new giraffe . How many sea lions were there before ? Is n't there one more now ? Oh , we may quarrel about the sea lions , or over the bears . The gorillas , whom we have known so well as " Peck 's Bad Boys , " as juvenile delinquents , will be fullgrown . THERE is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to , and never did . It 's all right . I 'd as soon remember it as see it . The man with the Tyrolean hat wo n't be at the bar , not now , not after ten years , twelve years . The memory is clear ; I need not go back ; there is nothing to puzzle or haunt . This is ready for packing . No , it is the place near there , where we went for cocktails once with people now dead , whose names I ca n't remember ? that is the place I would like to find again . Light from the remote winter sun was barely able to strike a spark from the green glass bowl in the window . It was a long winter that year , and spring was really a miracle . It must have been February or even March for there to have been sun at five o'clock . But the light was cold , it had come so far . In the afternoon nothing lived but the ticking of the clock ; all the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ? I would like to go back and look at the house . Perhaps then I would know . Remember , remember . Now the spell begins to work , now they come in clouds , the pictures I must snatch at . Central Park south on Sunday morning in the spring . We used to walk to Rumpelmayer 's for Sunday breakfast the year Mike was born . Oh , the yellow-green leaves of the ginkgo trees along the park as I ambled , elephantine and placid with pregnancy , through the sun . And the smell of whipped cream and chocolate in the restaurant as we went in . Smells are the clues to memory ? peanuts and red-hot franks mean those afternoons at the Polo Grounds when I tried to become a Giant fan . But I could never identify anyone except Ott and Harry the Horse , and I still do n't know what a bunt is , or if I do , I 'm probably wrong . I loved the afternoons , though , the enormous feeling of holiday , of work and routine I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that hung over the crowd . I loved the reverse feeling of climbing down into the bowl , down the steep , concrete path past the ticket stands , down the flat , wide steps to our seats . I loved the warm sun after the chill of the stands , and I was grateful to the men in straw hats , their coats on their laps and patches of sweat on their shirts , who were always willing to pass on their wisdom to us ? though I , of course , was the only one who needed it . Never again will I sit in the playground on the river beside the baby carriage , gocart , tricycle , baby carriage again , gocart , two tricycles . Never again will the grit blow in my eyes as I strain them to follow a red hood , a sailor hat , a ski cap . Two rivers flow there , the cars up the Drive and the river itself behind them , a double frieze daubed in dull grays and greens against the monstrous architecture of Welfare Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river traffic has thinned again , but in memory the war ghosts still go by ? the big gray freighter with a hole right through her bow , ten feet square , and daylight on the other side , and the men on deck waving to us . The British carrier that sneaked up to Hell Gate with about an inch of clearance on each side . The Juneau , the beautiful Juneau , tearing down with the tide one Sunday afternoon , and out to die . E WILL have acres and acres of green . We will have gardens rich with lilac and dogwood , more strawberries than we can pick . But will I ever forget the city garden I made on the terrace , or how good the wet ground in the tubs and the brick-banked beds could smell on a June morning ? I always got soaked when I watered the flowers . At last I learned to do it barefoot , in shirt and shorts , with the babies , naked , running under the hose , and the cats leaping ahead of us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in suspicion . ( And only too right , for the babies thought it funny to spray them . ) It was a nice garden when I had time to love it , and I feel base , even now , to be betraying it for the rich green river-bottom land in Connecticut , where we shall live submerged in maples , surrounded by lawns . April rain in New York , cold and raw after the fatal promise of a spring afternoon . Tenement streets on a hot night , life blasting out into the open like a jungle growth , too close , rank and strangling . Rows of red-brick houses on a narrow , curving street ? Gay Street , is n't it , that circles in like a crescent and out again to the same street it left ? And everywhere , any time ( though November is worst ) , the menace of strangeness . The gray cliffs of apartment houses overhanging the passer-by like the Mountains of the Moon , but not empty , not trodden by dreams . Solid , rather , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with going to bed and getting up , with the glacial change of family life . Is it possible that within these cliffs there are caves filled with lamplight and affection ? And the subway that rumbles beneath them ? is it only humans it transports through the anonymous darkness , pitching them from one end of the island and back again , every day ? Or do symbols and poetry ride beside us , to show us humanity jammed together , hurtling through the night , beneath regions we shall never see , in a shoving community  | of hurry and hate ? Shall we ever speak to each other , 0 subway travelers , shall we ever be friends ? Well , I will not be here to see the miracle . Good-bye to the city , then , to the grudging suspicion of the subway riders and to the turquoise dusk that awaits them at the end of their trip . Good-bye to the bridges , and to the overhead cranes of the Navy Yard . Good-bye to the insane , giant messages on the Jersey shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another hand has substituted the trade names of starches and vegetable fats . Good-bye to Cosmopolis , to Megapolis , which has been my home , as it is home for so many ? this city of fantasy and myth , honeycombed with commonplace ; built on a rabbit warren of families , grandmothers , children , tired women , angry men . Good-bye to the city where Langley Collyer was born and died , and where General Grant is buried at the end of the long journey from Galena , Illinois , by way of Chapultepec , Vicksburg , Richmond , and Washington . Good-bye to Mayor Philip Hone , goodbye to Mayor O'Dwyer . Good-bye to Willie the butcher and Sam the vegetable man . Good-bye to the boys playing stickball in the street ( it was punchball when I played it ) . Good-bye to the restaurant we never went into , the store windows we shopped , the things we did n't do , or buy , that we lose now forever . Now I shall put up pickles and can fruit and ride a bicycle barefoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . I have loved it very much .
