txt President Roosevelt asserted today the " complete and enduring safety of our form of government " rests on maintaining free elections  --  and added that " no dictator in history has ever dared to run the gantlet " of such an election . Yet , he said , in an address climaxing observance of the University of Pennsylvania 's 200th anniversary , there still were some well meaning persons who had suggested recently that the right to vote be denied people who had lost their jobs and were on relief . Before his address , the President received an honory degree of doctor of laws , as the seventh Chief Executive of the Nation to be so honored by the University ; others include Washington , Garfield , Taft , Theodore Roosevelt , Wilson , and Hoover . the latter receiving his second honorary Penn degree tomorrow . Cites Past Instance " Only too often in our political history , " the President declared , " the few at the top have tried to advise or dictate to the many lower down how they should vote . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regret to say , demands for a return of Government to the control of those few , who , because of business ability or economic omniscience , are supposed to be just a touch above the average of our citizens . " As in the days of Hamilton , we of our own generation should give them credit for pure intention and high ideals . Nevertheless , their type of political thinking could easily lead to Government by selfish seekers for power and riches and glory . For the great danger is that once the Government falls into the hands of a few elite , curtailment or even abolition of free elections might be adopted as the means of keeping them in power . " As long as periodic free elections survive , no set of people can permanently control government . In the maintenance of free elections rests the complete and enduring safety of our form of government . " Mr. Roosevelt spoke in Convention Hall , with three radio networks carrying his words to the Nation . It was an address which the White House had declined either before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pleased at Progress The Chief Executive , winding up an inspection of the Philadelphia Navy Yard prior to a speech which had the politicians wondering , said today that he is now convinced the Nation is learning speed in armament construction . He devoted the morning to a checkup of local phases of the $15,000,000,000 national defense program . The President said construction of warships and airplanes in the Navy Yard was going ahead at a much faster rate than a year ago and that he was very much pleased and amazed at the progress he saw there . He said he was told by Admiral A. E. Watson , Yard Commandant , that about 19,000 men are em ployed in the Yard and that by this time next year the figure will be stepped up to 30,000 . A year ago , Mr. Roosevelt said , Navy Yard employment was only 8,000 . The expansion , he said , dates from his order of last September to put about 30 World War destroyers back in shape for duty .

Mr. Roosevelt displayed particular enthusiasm over the naval aircraft factory . He referred to it as his " child " because it was built in 1916 while he was Assistant Secretary of the Navy . The plant represents , he said , the Government 's first effort to go in for aviation manufacture . Most of the planes being constructed at the aviation factory here , he added , are training planes which will be sent to the Naval Air Base at Pensacola for instruction of fledgling fliers . The President stopped at the Naval Hospital . At the Quartermaster Depot , in reality an industrial plant that serves as a wholesale house to supply the entire Army with uniforms and some equipage , most of the 6,000 employees lined the roadways and shouted and waved to the Chief Executive . The depot first began operations soon after the Revolutionary War . It now is trying to fill orders for 5110,000,000 in clothing and equipment .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
