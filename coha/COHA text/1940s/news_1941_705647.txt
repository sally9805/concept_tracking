txt Joe Louis still is world heavyweight champion , after his eighteenth defense of the title he won four years ago from Jim Braddock in Chicago . The famed Brown Bomber sank Billy Conn , former world lightheavyweight champion , with a depth-bomb in the thirteenth round of their scheduled fifteen-round battle before a crowd of 54,487 wildly excited fight fans , who paid $450,000 , in the Polo Grounds last night . But the Bomber will never come closer to being toppled from his throne than he did before Conn collapsed under the paralyzing power of nerve-deadening blows . Thus Joe escaped crashing into the category of the ring 's ex-champions . In a battle that was thrilling and highly spectacular to a degree not generally anticipated , Conn came within the proverbial eyelash of upsetting predictions as he stirred the emotions of the great crowd with a brand of battle few had dared expect , Louis least of all . Frail in Comparison The doughty Pittsburgher , 25% pounds lighter than Louis , frail in comparison and with none of the heavyweight fighting experience the champion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rounds , through twelve sessions while men and women , envisioning a transfer of the title , yelled themselves hoarse , encouraging the ' challenger as he seemed about to succeed where few had given him a chance . Then the fight ended , as it had been predicted it would end . Conn left himself open for one dangerous blow to a vital point . A desperate , harried Louis , fighting with savage fury , whipped home through the opening with a right to the jaw . The blow landed high , but it was a powerful one . Conn , a few seconds before on the high road to fame and fortune , tottered backward . His knees buckled . The Brown Bomber was the Alabama Assassin . He leaped in savagely , thudding home with both hands with a crushing fire . Conn fell under the barrage , a right to the jaw , as a final thrust , sending the brave challenger careening and crumpling . The challenger , who gave promise of becoming the champion , was counted out by Referee Eddie Joseph in 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene that was veritable bedlam . That is the way of the ring . One second you are on top . The next you are down in despair . Conn came to the realization of this painfully . Only Six Minutes More Billy was within two rounds of what appeared a victory . Actually , the battle had only six minutes and two seconds more to go . And the way Conn had performed there was every reason to believe a new champion would be crowned . Perhaps it was his own contempt for the punching prowess of the champion that led Conn into the fatal error . He had felt the Louis blow and survived . More , he had outboxed and , at times , outslugged the devastating puncher who has established himself as one of the greatest heavyweight champions of all time and without a pEer as defender of the throne . Perhaps Conn had come to the end of his endurance . His energy may have been burned up with the slashing battle he gave Louis through the eighth and up to and including the twelfth round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacle of Louis being pounded steadily about the ring by a lighter , fearless foeman . Whatever it was , the battle started as it had been predicted it would start , and it ended as it had been predicted it would end . Because , in advance , it had been said that Conn must rely on his speed if he were to survive and defeat Louis . It also had been told that Conn would drop the first time Louis hit him with a powerful punch to a vital spot . Avoids Bomber 's Punches The surprise , in addition to the wonderful battle Conn made , came I in the delay before Louis connected . This was a tribute to the ability of Conn , not only to avoid the Bomber 's - wallops , but his ability to withstand those that Louis landed . More , it was a testimonial to the surprising manner in which Conn fought in retaliation and sometimes on the attack , against the man every one else has feared since he ascended the throne . One of the greatest heavyweight battles of recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of older and better times in boxing . In the double-decked concrete and steel stand , in the temporary wooden chairs that had been placed on what is ordinarily the Giants ' baseball playing field , men and women sat , in rows extending back as far as the eye could reach in the darkness . They came from all sections of the country and from every walk of life . They came early and stayed late to thrill to a really great battle for the championship , one that will take its place alongside the best in ring history , from the standpoint of surprise , excitement and competitive appeal . A. sportsmanlike battle , it was cleanly fought , bitterly and cagily waged . It was tense with the element of the unexpected to a high degree . Governors of near-by States were in the gathering . There were Mayors of cities , national leaders in politics , Representatives , Senators , State lawmakers , bankers , merchants , leaders of the country 's commercial and industrial life , members of the clergy , stars of the stage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that uncertainty about whether the title would change hands , the majority , wishing it would , but feeling that it could n't . Fights True to Style This great gathering saw Conn fight a battle that was true to his style , of necessity , but better than usual , though it proved inadequate . And the crowd saw Louis fight as a champion should , a champion who refused to become discouraged though he was buffeted about outlandishly at times . Naturally , the greatest thrill came from Conn . The finish by Louis was an anti-climax . Most of those in the vast throng expected Joe to knock out the challenger , as he had done to challengers in fifteen previous defenses of the title . Few , however , expected of the frail-looking Conn the battle he flashed ? ' least of all Louis , if the truth is known . Unmistakably Louis has slipped . Even making allowances for style ? the contrast in styles was ineseapable  --  the champion is not the champion of old . He was not sure of himself last night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found him in the ring with a veritable wraith for speed . But the speed that Louis once boasted himself is gone , the accuracy behind his punch is slipping . He is becoming heavy-footed and heavy-armed , weaknesses which were reflected as he floundered at times in his quest of the target that was Conn . One thing remains undiminished with Louis and that can not be denied . He still is an annihilating puncher . His right hand claims a victim when it lands . His left hook jars a foe to the heels and props him for the finishing potion that is in the right hand . Surprises Most Onlookers Conn , almost exclusively , boxed Louis through the first seven rounds . Having gone so far , Billy became confident . He became overconfident in the eighth and surprising most onlookers , was hammering his way past Louis in grand style . The challenger started the fight on treacherous feet . He slipped coming out of his corner soon after ithe opening gong and , before the first round ended , he went down 1 while pivoting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conn struck a blow . Through the first three rounds Conn sparred cautiously and skillfully , dancing before the shuffling , plodding Louis who moved steadily , stealthily in on the attack . Billy 's plan was to stay away ; Louis 's was to get close and strike home with short jolts to the body and head . Louis struck a number of these blows in the first three rounds , picking most of Conn 's left hooks off in midair the meanwhile . The champion 's blows , however , had no deterring effect on the sprightly Conn , who only once , in the third round , resorted to a covering stance as a defensive move . But the challenger ended the third with a flurry in which he drove Louis to the ropes under a fiery volley of lefts and rights to the head and body , amid the roars of the crowd . Conn outdid himself in the fourth *en he started making the champion 's jaw the target for a succes-1 sion of rights . They were blows driven home at long range , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armor , they only made Joe blink . Shoots Home Left Hook The challenger was proceeding with a daring attack in the fifth , when Louis suddenly shot home a left hook to the jaw . Coma staggered under the blow and sought retreat . But Louis was upon him , drilling lefts and rights to the head and face -. s Billy , lurching and staggering , covered against attack . The blows opened a cut over Conn 's right eye . Another cut appeared on the bridge of his nose . But Billy survived the storm and managed to keep out of harm 's way in the sixth and in the seventh . Then , with the eighth , Conn launched a thrilling attack of his own . He parried most of Louis 's lunges early in the round and began making a target of Joe 's jaw for right-hand smashes that went home straight and often . The blows lacked steam and merely flustered the titleholder . More important , however , is the fact that the success of his offensive lifted Conn 's confidence . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assault to his fistic fire . " You got a tough fight tonight , " it developed later , was what Conn said , although the words were indistinguishable at the time above the roar of the crowd . " That 's right , " replied Louis , who continued shuffling into a rival who was banging him around scandalously . Trades Blows Willingly Repeatedly Conn drilled home with his right to the jaw in the ninth . He ripped full-arm rights to the body . Left jabs brought blood from Louis 's nose . A left hook to the body hurt Joe before the bell . All the time Louis was helpless to counter the fire . Infuriated in the tenth , Louis pressed his foe hard . Once Conn slipped on the wet canvas in his own corner in escaping a fierce lunge . Billy traded blows with the champion , giving as good as he received and sometimes better . Through the eleventh Conn fought gallantly as he hammered the titleholder from all angles , beating Louis about the face and jaw with rights at long range and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winced under some of these blows . He was infuriated under others : But he could do nothing about them . In the twelfth Conn , after an exchange in which one of Louis 's lefts cut him under the left eye , suddenly rocked Louis on his heels with a full-arm left hook to the jaw . Staggering , Louis dived into a clinch to keep from falling while Conn fought furiously in a bid for a knockout . , Maybe this shot that went true and staggered the champion made Conn overconfident . At any rate , he was the pursuer instead of the pursued as the thirteenth started and he made the mistake of going too close to Louis too often . Battered by the desperate champion 's powerful lefts and rights about the head , Conn suddenly emerged from close quarters flailing furiously for Louis 's jaw with lefts and rights in an outburst that electrified the crowd . Lands Flush on Jaw Suddenly Louis 's right shot out on an opening ' with a blow that landed flush on Conn 's jaw . The challenger 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Louis knew it . And Joe thundered in with that savagery that is his characteristic when he has a foe in distress . About the headaLand face Louis fired countless rights and lefts while Conn sought to cover and retreat . Some of the blows missed , but many of them landed , carrying force even against Billy 's defense of raised gloves . The Bomber shifted his fire to the body . Blows there hurt Conn , sapped the speed from his legs , took the last ounce of his endurance . Billy was slipping about uncertainly when Louis drove over the right-hand blow to the jaw that toppled him in defeat within two seconds of the end of the round , and shattered a dream of a championship . The police detail was the largest ever assigned to a boxing event in this city . A total of 2,250 of New York 's finest patrolled the Polo Grounds , inside and out , and the streets of Harlem . Chief Inspector Edward M. Butler was in charge of the detail inside the park . Deputy Chief Inspector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Seven hundred police , some of them carrying the old-fashioned night sticks , patrolled Harlem streets from 8 P. M. on . More than 300 others were on reserve duty between the East 126th Street and the West 135th Street stations . There were 200 detectives , sixty-six mounted police , thirty-three motorcycle men and two emergency squads on the job . Trouble was not expected . It has been characteristic of Louis battles hereabouts that they have been taken in stride , with a minimum of disorder in the Harlem district , regardless of whether he won or lost . But the Police Department , at the same time , wanted to take no chances . Plenty of Betting Betting on the fight was active , with no change in the odds . Louis was the favorite at 1 to 4 to win and the price on him to score a knockout was 5 to 11 . Trick bets on the number of rounds were numerous but inconsequential . The volume was reported on decision . The 1-to-4 odds appealed to many Conn supporters and others who inevitably " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 3 . Among those seen at the ringside were James A.

The first preliminary entered the ring promptly on time . The principals were Jose Basora , Puerto Rican , and Jerry Fiorello , Brooklynite . It was a four-round battle between middleweights and at the conclusion of twelve minutes of slugging the decision was rendered in Basora 's favor without criticism from the crowd . He was the cleaner hitter and was entitled to the award . Basora weighed 154 pounds and Fiorello 152 .

Holman Williams of Detroit , a stable-mate of Louis , won the award over Antonio Fernandez , Chilian boxer , in their six-round bout . The shifty style of attack by Williams more than balanced the scales against Fernandez 's fiery bursts of fighting . The decision , however , was not popular . The victor weighed 152% pounds and Fernandez 149 . In the semi-final of six rounds Tommy Tucker , fighting Jack Tar from Uncle Sam 's Navy , hammered his way to the decision over Charlie Harvey , West Side heavyweight . Harvey was taller and heavier than Tucker , but these were handicaps rather than advantages for the West Sider . Tucker was faster and shiftier with his fire .
