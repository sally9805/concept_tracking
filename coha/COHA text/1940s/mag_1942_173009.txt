Out of the long struggle for wartime power in Washington , a team finally emerged last week to take command of U.S. economic warfare over the world : Vice President Henry Agard Wallace and his right-hand man Milo Perkins . Their Board of Economic Warfare was nine months old ; but the power given them by the President and the importance of their seats in his cut-down War Cabinet were not only new but big . <P> BEW , started , built and run by the Wallace-Perkins team , now took full stature with the Army , the Navy and Donald Nelson 's War Production Board . By executive order , BEW took stockpile control from the slow hands of Jesse Jones . BEW took the final say on international trade away from the State Department , the first successful raid by the New Deal on Secretary Hull 's demesne since 1933 . <P> In the field it once shared with a half-dozen other agencies , BEW is the new boss : over imports of rubber and copper ; over the freeze-out of the Axis from foreign markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Axis production ; over help to friendly nations by sending them what they need . <P> Little Acorn . BEW began only last August as a 50 edition of Britain 's Ministry of Economic Warfare . All it had was Wallace , Perkins and a problem : in the delicate , murderous , bloodless warfare that is half diplomacy and half business , the U.S. was taking a bad licking . <P> The Axis , whose State and business are synonymous , always moved in a straight line . Its businessmen abroad had one job : to win the war . They grabbed war-essential raw materials in exchange for cameras or money , without figuring the price . They let everything else go , foregoing nickel-nickel peacetime profits for the great rewards of war . <P> But to the U.S. , diplomacy , business and war were three different things . The U.S. lagged in setting up stockpiles , sold scrap and oil to unfriendly nations . <P> Wallace and Perkins had a hard time setting Washington afire . BEW 's zeal for stockpiles was muffled in asbestos by Jesse Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the State Department . BEW had great plans to cut off oil from Spain , get useful chrome instead of useless gold from South Africa ; the State Department cooled them off in a hurry . <P> Big Oak . For all his detachment , Henry Wallace knows how to handle himself in Washington clinches . This time he had potent help from Donald Nelson and quiet , able Budget Director Harold Smith . Last week 's executive order lifted Wallace above wrangling . Henceforth Jesse Jones must sign any check Wallace shoves at him . Henceforth the State Department may enter only formal protests . <P> Wallace , who will soon resign from WPB 's board to give full attention to BEW , already has a hand-picked staff of 1,100 , *swarming all over a new apartment building on Washington 's Q Street . Above all , he has Milo Perkins , 42 , of Milwaukee , Wis . <P> Stocky , slit-eyed Milo Randolph Perkins , instead of going to college , sold newspapers , magazine subscriptions , fruits and vegetables , gunny sacks . At 23 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Houston , Tex. , he quit to start his own business . At 35 , he was making $20,000 a year .
