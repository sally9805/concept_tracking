 | Our family was run on a dollars -- and-cents and-cents basis , and , as I look back , it was a good system . I ca n't remember my parents ' giving me or my brothers cash except at Christmas or on birthdays . We were always in the money ? but we earned it . It used to puzzle me sometimes why we had to pay our own way to the movies or buy our own ice-cream cones or baseball mitts when other boys ' parents ? aid for everything . Now I under3tand what my father and mother were trying to do ? teach us the value of time and property . When I was about ten years old and my two brothers were younger still , my parents bought several acres on the outskirts of town and built a house . Most of the land . vas in woods ; but Dad planted two Dr three acres of family orchard , . awn , vegetable and flower gardens . The little trees had to be watered , and the garden needed weeding . Father outlined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the . ob . " All right , " Dad would say , make me a proposition . " The first time he said that , we talked it over and decided to hit aim for real money ? ten cents an - lour . " You 're hired , " he told us , " but no tree climbing . " This was a shot at my younger brother , who never could pass a tree without climbing it . We , the alders , were able to stay out of trees , and soon were raised to tvelve cents and then to fifteen ; tents an hour . But it took my ounger brother a long time to de elop to the point where he was . north fifteen cents an hour . The epidemic of gophers that : wept the place that first year was bane to Dad , a boon to us . He bought a dozen traps and gave them to us . " There 's a bounty on gophers , " he explained . " Twenty-five cents for each dead gopher . " We had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to qualify for the bounty . We caught so many , that first summer , and made such good money , that it gave us capitalistic ideas . We tried other money-making ventures , too . One year we had a surplus of vegetables , and Dad suggested that we sell them , taking half the money we received as sales commissions and putting the other half in the treasury of the Hilltop Farm , Inc . A neighbor who was a lawyer drew up corporation papers for us . Though we never actually filed our papers , my brothers and I were stockholders , the directors , and the officers of the company . At the end of the summer we had $24 in the treasury . One day the directors voted to spend it all for baseball , football , and other sports equipment . That was all right with our parents ; they took the view that anything we earned was ours to spend as we pleased . After the acquisitive sense had been instilled , our parents discovered the system had other uses . One was discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were quite young , we developed a habit of yelling at one another . My mother put a glass jar on the mantelpiece . " That 's going to be the fine ' jar , " she said . " Anyone who raises his voice at anybody else has to put a nickel in it . " One of my brothers protested , " Sometimes you and Dad raise your voices at us . " " All right , every time . we do we 'll be fined , too , " she said . Everybody agreed that was fair . Afterward , if any of us were late at the table , showed bad manners , were caught in slovenly habits or any other breach of family rules , there was a price to be paid . Hardearned pennies had to go into the jar . The fine-jar hardened into a family institution after the first Fourth of July , when we emptied it to buy fireworks . After that , every year we had a big Independence Day blowoff . As far back as I can remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day each of us was born ; but most of the funds in them was money that we had earned the hard way . I recall that , about the time I entered high school , Dad offered to match at the end of the year whatever we had in our bank accounts . That is how we acquired our first car . Two of us were in high school by that time , and we had been visiting the used-car lots regularly . When we found a bargain , we mentioned it pointedly at the dinner table . Finally Dad said , " When you fellows find a car you want to buy , I 'll put up half the price if you 'll put up the rest . " We each had $25 and talked $5 more out of the tree climber , whose earnings were still sketchy . We picked out the jalopy we wanted , @#  | . open roadster , although Dad thought ! needed a closed car . He was right , ) , because when we took girls to pars in our open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Soon we were rating to borrow the family car . The joint-ownership jalopy was a headhe in other ways , too . Nobody wanted put in more gas than he used in one p . My brother would go to the service ttion and say , " Fill her up ? with one lion . " Usually he and I wanted the car the same time . Finally Dad said : " Let 's ti it and divide the money . I 'll buy a ed closed car and rent it to you on the 1eage basis . " After that , whoever Milted the car paid three cents a mile , had it deducted from his earnings that ! ek . The user kept the mileage in a tle notebook always in the car . We ttled once a week at a house meeting . Those meetings were an institution , to . They were the occasions for settlemats of interfamily debts , and an oprtunity for everybody to get anything f his chest . Our parents saved up scoldgs for these occasions . They were n't hidings actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . td never closed a house meeting withIt inviting each of us to have his say . we had any objection to the way the roily was run , we could say so . By the time one brother and I were dy for college , we had accumulated out $300 apiece in our savings accounts . @#  | Dad had an idea that we would appreciate our college training more if we paid for a part of it . He had worked his way through college without any help , but did n't want us to do that , so he offered to put up three dollars for every one we invested . We chose different universities , which was all right with him . When we worked out our budgets , he handed us a check for treble the amount we had agreed to invest for the first year . " This is all there is , " he said . " If you live by your budget , you will have enough to get through the first year easily . If you spend it all the first month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because there wo n't be any . " It might not work in every family , but the money method of operating was a good one for ours . It put a value on time and effort at an age when neither of these items meant anything to our companions . We knew how many hours it took to earn what we got . It gave value to whatever we bought . We learned to pass up things we wanted in only a half-hearted way and to save our dollars for something we really desired . The system gave our parents a simple means of enforcing discipline . The heaviest fine any of us ever paid was n't a fine at all , but a settlement of a debt . After seeing a romantic movie one evening , a neighbor boy and I went out into the moonlight feeling as adventuresome as the three musketeers in the picture . I had one of the family cars on the three-cents-a-mile basis . We got into it and drove two hundred miles to a lake where two girls we knew were vacationing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy 's parents , frantic like my own , traced him by long-distance phone and ordered him home . After a breakfast with the girls , I had to drive him back two hundred miles . His parents , overjoyed after a sleepless night of fear that I had driven him over a cliff , did nothing . Mine , who figured I was old enough to know better , calculated the distance we had driven . I spent some strenuous days with a pick and shovel leveling ground for a family badminton court , paying for my uncontrolled urge to see the world . Each swing of the pick taught me a little more about the difference between a silly and a sound expenditure of time and money .
