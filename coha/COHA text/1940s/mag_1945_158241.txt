All week long a cloud-part frost , part smoke , part dust-hung over the agony of Budapest . From the heights of Buda , Red Army soldiers occasionally saw the spires of a cathedral swim out of the cloud 's dark folds , stand in the clear for a few moments , disappear again . For miles around , the snow was black with soot from the cloud . In the heart of the town a grim struggle raged through the days &; nights , block by block , brick by brick . As the battle neared its 15th day , the Russians had won more than 1,900 of the 4,500 blocks of buildings in the city . Landmarks of one of the most beautiful capitals in Europe were crumbling under artillery and mortar fire . Coronation Church and the Royal Palace were partly gone ; a wing of the Parliament building lay in rubble . <P> On Rudolf Quay . Beside the tank barricades and rolls of barbed wire which the Germans threw across the streets , the pavements were littered with piles of broken furniture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a house they threw the contents into the street . Rudolf Quay was littered with an untidy heap of crumpled pianos . <P> The defenders had the advantage of fighting from old houses with thick stone walls . Antitank guns were hidden in gateways and cellar windows . Entrances , street intersections , bridges were all mined . The Russians concentrated on taking corner buildings , setting up . a sweeping fire along the streets and leapfrogging to another corner building . <P> In cellars not used as forts , Budapest 's civilians huddled , their normal numbers of 1,000,000 swollen to perhaps 2,000,000 by refugees who had fled the war-ravaged countryside expecting to find safety in the city . They were dying by hundreds . <P> Frosty Shrouds . Heavy hoarfrost formed each night ; the dead did not stink . They froze hard as stone and in the morning they were wrapped in eerie shrouds of frost . <P> In the hills west and northwest of the city the Germans hurled tanks and planes into a drive to reach their trapped garrison . They slashed more than halfway through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital , captured Esztergom , riverside anchor of the Red Army front south of the Danube . They were taking desperate chances , for north of the river the Russians were still rolling westward , an evergrowing menace to the German flank . But German commanders knew that success might dam the Russian tide flowing toward Austria . And Dr. Edmund Veehsenmayer , the Nazi Minister to Hungary , had growled : " We do n't care if ten Budapests are destroyed , provided we can save one Vienna . "
