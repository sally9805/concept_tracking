Roland Sala in Harlem Court . The allegations were brought out during the sentencing of a defendant in a policy case from whom the book was taken and who had been under investigation by Mr. Bromberger since his arrest on Dec. 27 . A police official also testified that there had been a wholesale shifting of Harlem policemen since the man 's arrest . The defendant denied that he ever had owned such a book and the arresting officer asserted that he had no knowledge of its existence . However , Magistrate Sala said he knew the elusive " black book " was in Mr. Bromberger 's hands , and when he requested that it be produ ! ed in court so that he " might more intelligently comprehend the case , " the commissioner refused to produce it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , Magistrate Sala said : " The court is within its power to teach some public officials some decency . The court has the power to subpoena , and if the subpoena is disobeyed the public official could be sent to jail . It is only personal admiration for Commissioner Bromberger that restrains me from taking that step . " The defendant , Nicholas F. Georgeadis , 50 years old , of 3055 Bailey Avenue , the Bronx , was sentenced to nine months in prison and fined $500 or an additional six-month term . Magistrate Sala said he was willing to suspend sentence if Georgeadis would talk to the police or Mr. Bromberger . Georgeadis , who pleaded ignorance of " a document of tremendous importance and magnitude , " was found guilty on Monday after a trial . His case was adjourned eight times since his arrest . The magistrate asserted that the investigation conducted by Mr. Bromberger and the police had " ended in a fiasco " because Georgeadis had refused to make disclosures and was protecting the real criminals ? " corrupt public officials . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Police Commissioner Valentine 's confidential squad in a public market , owned by his brother , at 275 West 117th Street . Policy slips were found and the police contended that the market was the " drop off " for policy collectors . The cash register , according to Patrolman Latwin , was so contrived that it issued receipts of policy numbers played . Declaring that this was not the usual policy case , Magistrate Sala conducted a pre-sentence investigation in open court to gain " vital information . " The magistrate questioned Latwin and Deputy Inspector Emil Jahelka , his superior officer . ? Inspector Jahelka told the court that " this is not an ordinary policy case " and that from San . 1 , 1944 , to Dec. 4 of the same year there had been nine policy arrests in the market . The inspector pointed out that a special Harlem squad , making a survey of the policy racket , had noted that Georgeadis ' store adjoined the establishment of Max Katz , known as " the king of policy , " now serving a penitentiary sentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This was a policy drop , and I believe Georgeadis had something to do with Max Katz ' policy ring . " Magistrate Sala asked Patrolman Latwin whether he had taken a small , black book " with the names of police officials and officers and money paid to them ? " " No , not to my knowledge , " the patrolman said . " I never saw the book . " Inspector Jehelka admitted that since Georgeadis ' arrest there had been a series of transfers from the Harlem area . Later Magistrate Sala said that there " is no doubt that Georgeadis was the pay-off man for the biggest policy ring since the death of the late Dutch Schultz . " Harry F. Mogel , Georgeadis ' attorney , declared that his client was being made a " goat " in a simple policy case . The defendant has two sons in the service , one in the Army in Germany and the other in the Navy , just returned from the Iwo campaign . Magistrate Sala in reviewing bookmaking and policy cases said that gambling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and monopolized by the underworld , " it was the most vicious , indescribable menace to society . " The magistrate declared he had an eight-point program to " sound the death - knell for bookmaking and policy-playing . " He suggested that the law be amended to take away the magistrate 's right to impose fines in such cases and make a jail sentence . mandatory . Another point was to take away the power from police lieutenants and sergeants to accept stationhouse bail in such cases , and that the lowest . bail possible be $1,500 instead of $500 . Inquiry Still Going On Mr. Bromberger , reached later at his office , explained that his policy-racket investigation still was in progress . For this reason , he said , his office would not make public any document in connection with the inquiry until a final report had been submitted to Mayor La Guardia . It was reported by reliable sources that more than eighty names were listed in the book and that opposite each name was a sum of money and the date it had been paid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document in question would be available to him if he visited the offices of the Department of Investigation . Mr. Bromberger added that it would be possible for innocent victims to be smeared if documents were made public before the completion of an investigation . This procedure is a policy long practiced by his department , he declared .
