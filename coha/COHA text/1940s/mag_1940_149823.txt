Tennessee 's chicken-necked Boss Ed Crump once found it convenient to play ball with Memphis ' Republican Negro boss . That was when there was a Republican in the White House and the Negro boss had Federal patronage to dispose of . Since Roosevelt , there has not even been a Negro boss . <P> With the candidacy of Wendell Willkie , Negro political hopes revived . Big , coffee-colored Dr. J. B. Martin , a Memphis druggist for 30 years , president of a Negro baseball league and owner of the Memphis Red Sox , took over the leadership , organized Republican Negroes for a campaign . The Crump machine took one quick look and went into high . <P> Eleven days before the election , two uniformed policemen from Commissioner " Holy Joe " Boyle 's police department arrayed themselves before Martin 's store on Florida Street , two more went to the poolroom and restaurant of Negro Republican Elmer Atkinson on Beale Avenue . Anyone who tried to enter either place was frisked . Holy Joe declared that they were looking for dope . Negroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at least one hundred were run in for carrying knives with blades longer than the six-inch maximum allowed by law . Twenty colored kindergartners were lined up , pawed over by the Crump cops . Frisked in front of Atkinson 's was Father Bertrand Kock , white pastor of Mrs. Atkinson 's church . Police patted his Franciscan robe , made him take off his shoes . <P> To Negro politicians meanwhile went anonymous threatening letters . Crump cops spread through Beale Avenue , raided poolrooms , restaurants , hustled vanloads of Negroes off to the clink . <P> Atkinson gave up , closed the business he had run for 14 years . Said he : " For the past two weeks police have n't let anybody come in the place . " Crump cops still blockaded Martin 's drugstore . It was plain to everyone in Memphis last week that Boss Crump did not want any more Negro Republican bosses around . Growled Crump 's Holy Joe : " Governor Prentice Cooper was right when he said , ' This is a white man 's country . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
