At St. Louis last month , with the Professional Golfers ' Association championship in his grasp , Ben Hogan found the grind just about too hard to take . " I want to die an old man , not a young one , " he told reporters . Every golfer in the big time-a businesslike gang that lives a life of tense desperation from hole to hole and tourney to tourney-knew just how he felt . The game had changed from the day of the great Walter Hagen , when a pro played in about 15 tournaments a year . Now it is a year-round business , in which only half a dozen do better than break even financially . <P> Last week , little ( 137 Ibs . ) Ben Hogan showed up in Los Angeles ( along with 170 others ) to play in the U.S. Open . He seemed the coolest of the lot . As always , his face was as phlegmatic as an oldtime faro dealer's. * The long Riviera golf course was to his advantage . Although he insists that " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's playing style , " the boys called Riviera " Hogan 's Alley . " He had won two Los Angeles Opens there in the past two years . <P> Muscle Memory . The first day Ben fired a 67 ( four under par ) and was tied for the lead . The tension seemed to sharpen rather than scuttle his game ( " Keeps me awake " ) . Carefully , before each shot , he went over it in his mind , a trick to get " the tempo " of the stroke , in effect making the shot before he hit the ball . He calls it " muscle memory . " <P> There were little , routine distractions-the exasperating clicks of cameras , the chatter of spectators ( Ben draws the largest galleries ) , the unnerving applause coming from another green . On the second round , a couple of happy-go-lucky dogs yapped about the course after him ( the committee quickly enforced the no-dog rule ) . At the halfway point , Ben had fallen one stroke behind Sam Snead , and South Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for second . <P> Chips Down . Next day , with the chips down , cool Ben played Riviera as if he owned it . On " Hogan 's Alley " that morning he posted a 68 . He began the afternoon round with a birdie and finished it by sinking a six-footer-then flipped the ball casually to an admiring youngster and strode into the clubhouse . His score of 276 chopped five strokes off the U.S. Open record ( Ralph Guldahl 's 281 at Michigan 's Oakland Hills Country Club eleven years ago ) . The runner-up : fancy-pants Jimmy Demaret , last year 's top money winner . <P> Not since chunky Gene Sarazen did it 26 years ago had a golfer won the P.G.A . and the Open the same summer . It looked as if big-time golf had again found a man it could call champion . <P> <P> * Somewhere in the past , Ben Hogan learned to " shuffle " a deck of cards . Occasionally , he shows the boys some of his sleight-of-hand tricks , by way of explaining why he never plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
