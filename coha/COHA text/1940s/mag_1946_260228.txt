Not since Eleuthre du Pont built his powder works 144 years ago had there been so much fireworks in Delaware . Tiny University of Delaware had been unbeaten for 29 games-a record that outshone Army 's . It had a high-stepping halfback , ex-marine Gerald ( " Doc " ) Doherty , who averaged 13.5 yds. every time he carried the ball , and a second-string replacement who averaged twelve . It had three full squads that trotted on &; off the field as units . Last week Delaware 's Blue Hens played their last game of the season , against little Muhlenberg , which also had been undefeated all year . Wilmington Park was n't nearly big enough to hold everybody who wanted to see football 's biggest little game . The victor : Delaware , 20-12 . <P> The brand of smokeless powder that Delaware 's quiet , 6 ft . Coach Bill Murray uses is the outmoded double-wing with unbalanced line to the left instead of the right . He disdains the flashier T and trickery ( " If you ca n't dig ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hens like to kick-off instead of receive , then concentrate on blocking kicks , intercepting passes , running back punts for touchdowns . That 's the way Bill Murray , a onetime Duke halfback , had a 36-game winning streak in his previous job : coaching the Children 's Home , a Methodist orphanage in Winston-Salem , N.C. <P> The New Year 's Day Rose Bowl rivals were chosen last week-and nobody was very happy about the choice . The Big Nine , who for 25 years have kept their fingers out of all Bowls , signed a contract with the Pacific Coast Conference which promised that , for the next three years , the westerners must play the Big Nine champ , and nobody else . Unbeaten U.C.L.A. beat its deadliest rival and Los Angeles neighbor , U.S.C. , last week ( 13-6 ) , and will represent the West . Twice-beaten Illinois defeated Northwestern 20-0 , and will presumably represent the East . That left Army 's far superior team-which wanted to play in the Rose Bowl-out in the cold , cold air . Said U.C.L.A. 's All-America prospect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad to hitchhike to West Point to play the cadets. "
