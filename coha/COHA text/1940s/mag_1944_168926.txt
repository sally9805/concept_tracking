The snow lay white again upon the stony soil of New England , the grey distances of the plains , the towering Western mountains ; once more poinsettias bloomed in the South 's red soil . In Boston 's fabled Louisburg Square , and in every other U.S. city and hamlet , carolers would sing this week below candlelit windows . <P> This would be the fourth U.S. wartime Christmas . The first already seemed as if it had been in another decade . On Christmas Eve , 1941 , antiaircraft guns were set up in the backyards of West Coast cities . San Antonio 's telephone system was jammed by a rumor-the Jap Fleet was cruising into the Gulf of Mexico . Electric toasters , alarm clocks , nylon stockings were still for sale . There were debutante balls at which orchestras played Blues in the Night . Everywhere , East , West and South , the people waited for air raids . Christmas , they thought , would be just the time the enemy would choose . <P> But now the air-raid sirens were silent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were begrimed . The early battles at Wake and Manila seemed almost as distant as the Argonne . <P> Mud , Cold and Death . Christmas , 1944 , would find millions of Americans overseas . To front-line troops , Christmas would be another day of mud , cold , death and wounds . There seemed no prospect of the spontaneous Christmas Day truces of World War I. But everywhere , on U.S. war fronts , there would be time for religious services-on the field , in tiny tents and in foreign churches . Sometimes the churches would also be crowded with white-swathed wounded ( see cut ) . <P> In every theater homesick men would hear the ancient words " . . . and on earth peace , good will to men . ... " and secretly treasure their memories of warmth , love and good cheer . Hundreds of fighting ships would have Christmas trees , flown west from Pearl Harbor . Admiral Nimitz would be visited by a Seabee Santa Claus . Soldiers slogging up Highway 65 , near the Fifth Army 's Italian front , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apennine pine decorated with 400 colored lights . G.I.s would have Christmas parties for children in France , England , Italy , Iceland , the Philippines ; and each father could seek out children the same age as his own , and play at being home again .
