txt Reading the news these days , millions of people follow ? with ' anxiety the sayings and doings of eminent men . Mr. Attlee or Mr. Truman , Mr. Stalin or Mr. Chiang Kai-shek , all seem to be making history . We wait to see what sort of history they will make . Within certain limits they can take decisive steps . Yet it ought to be evident that history is not the creation of a handful of strategically placed individuals  --  not in this century , not in the United States , not in China , not even in Russia . It is a democratic article of faith that the wills and thoughts of millions must not be dictated by the few . It is a discovery of the democratic system that they can not be . One can say this with confidence even as one looks at the impenetrable facade of Russia . If absolute unanimity prevailed , the facade would not be necessary . No doubt Russia has divergent popular opinions . No doubt these operate on governmental policy , if not through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common man in any country may protest , if he is told that the responsibility for making history rests on him , that he does not know how to make history . He thinks he is waiting for some third person singular or plural  --  some elected or appointed " He " or " They " ? to attend to historymaking . But he is mistaken . A President is not 140,000,000 times as wise as another American ; a member of Congress is not 300,000 times as wise . Each functions by consent . Each , whatever the imperfections of the electoral machinery , must answer to the surge and flow of popular desire . These are not academic speculations . The citizen can not abdicate in favor of the real or supposed great man . The citizen is an officer of government , too . He may have to leave technical details to the technicians . We are past the stage when we believed that any man could fill any public post . The average citizen can not make an A-bomb , build a battleship or fix the optimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important . He can decide for himself what he will do to avoid war , what sacrifices he will make to keep the domestic economy stable , what sort of life he hopes his children will enjoy . When this average citizen talks with his neighbors , at home , in the corner drug store , on the train , in his club meetings , his words will not be reported in the newspapers . Yet such words , in countless conversations , may be decisive . The burden of honest and accurate thinking lies upon all of us ? perhaps most of all upon those who never get into print . We must not feel helpless in the presence of great historical forces . Such forces are merely the total of what the common man either consents to or works for . In this country , strategically placed in time and in location , the common man is powerful , if only he does not yield to fatalism , if he works and thinks positively . Are we doomed to another war ? He can say No . Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trading in friendly fashion with all nations ? He can say Yes . If he speaks up , the great men and the eminent personages will have to obey him .
