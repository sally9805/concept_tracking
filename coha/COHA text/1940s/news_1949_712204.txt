txt Jackie Robinson , Brooklyn Dodgers ' star , dealt in blunt philosophy about Negroes , communism and racial discrimination today as he appeared before the House Committee on Un-American Ac-4 tivities to dispute a declaration by Paul Robeson , singer and actor , that Negroes would not fight against Russia . The text of Jackie Robinson 's statement appears on Page 14 . Mr. Robinson , first of his race to be signed by the major leagues , called the Robeson statement silly and untrue . He contended , however , that statements and activities by others also were confusing American thought , resulting in " a terrific lot of misunderstanding on this subject of communism among the Negroes . " And , he added , " it 's bound to hurt my people 's cause unless it 's cleared up . " The witness told the committee and a crowded hearing room that " I do n't pretend to be an expert on communism or any other kind of political ' ism . ' " He said college , the war and trying to make good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . busy without becoming an ' expert ' ? except on base stealing . " But he did ask to be put down as " an expert on being a colored American , with thirty years of experience at it . " He said he had not beea " fooled " because he had had opportunities . " I know that life in these United States can be mighty tough for people who are a little different from the majority , in their skin color or the way they worship their God , or the way they spell their names , " he declared . The fact that a Communist denounces " injustice in the courts , police brutality and lynching when it happens , " he said , did not " change the truth of his charges . " However , he contended , " a lot of people try to pretend that the whole issue is a creation of Communist imagination . " " Negroes were stirred up long before there was a Communist party , " he said , " and they 'll stay stirred up long after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by then as well * * We can win our fight without the Communists , and we do n't want their help . " Mr. Robinson said his testimony might divide his fans , hurting his box-office standing . " And so it is n't very pleasant for me to find myself in the middle of a public argument that has nothing to do with the standing of the Dodgers in the pennant race ? or even the pay raise I am going to ask Mr. Branch Rickey for next year , " he asserted . The witness had been asked to discuss the Robeson statement concerning Negroes and possible war with Russia . If Mr. Robeson made the statement , he said , " it sounds very silly to me . " " But , " Mr. Robinson added , " he has a right to his personal views , and if he wants to sound silly when he expresses them in public , that 's his business and not mine . He 's still a famous ex-athlete and a great singer and actor . " 31 Months in Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ' service , said he understood there were " some few " Negroes who were members of the Communist party and that they would be likely to act " just as any other Communists would " in the event of war with Russia . This , he held , would be true of Communists of other minority and majority groups . There were Negro pacifists , too , he said , and they would act like pacifists of any color . " And most Negroes  --  and Italians and Irish and Jews and Swedes and Slays and other Americans -- - " he added , " would act just as all these groups did in the last war . " They 'd do their best to help their country stay out of war ; if unsuccessful , they 'd do their best to help their country win the war ? against Russia or any other enemy that threatened us . " What he was saying , Mr. Robinson emphasized , was not as a defense of the Negro 's loyalty . Any loyalty that needed defense , he observed , " ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What he was trying to " get across , " he said , was this : That the American public was " off on the wrong foot " when it began to think of radicalism in terms of any special minority group . He said that it was such thinking that " gets people scared because one Negro , addressing a Communist group in Paris , threatens an organized boycott by 15,000,000 members of his race . " Negroes and others have too much Invested in the country 's welfare " for any of us to throw it away because of a siren song sung in bass , " Mr. Robinson declared . But that , however , did not mean that the fight ' against race discrimination was going to stop . It meant , instead , he said , that " we 're going to fight it all the harder because our stake in the future is so big . " Committee members appeared to be impressed . As Mr. Robinson completed his statement a voice from the audience shouted , " Amen . "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
