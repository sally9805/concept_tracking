HERE is the first comprehensive story of best-sellers in the United States , and it starts with a new definition of the subject . According to Frank Luther Mott , the author of Golden Multitudes ( Macmillan ; $5 ) , a best-seller is any book which , during the years since it was first published in this country , has been bought by a number of Americans equal to one percent of the population at the time it was published . Mott is trying to invent an extensible and collapsible yardstick by which he can measure relative popularity at different eras . The yardstick works in some cases , but in others it leads to worse confusion , as we can see by applying it to only three of the books on Mott 's list of 324 " over-all best-sellers . " Thane allare4a . Let us start with The Prince of the House of David , by Joseph Holt Ingraham . That solemn , biblical novel is now forgotten except by scholars , and unread except by children who come across it in very old Sunday-school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its appearance in 185 5 . The United . States had 23,191,876 inhabitants by the census of 1850 , and Ingraham 's novel was bought by considerably more than 230,000 persons , or one percent of the census population . It therefore deserves a place on Mott 's over-all list . Captain from Castile , by Samuel Shellabarger , has also earned a place on the list . It is a historical romance CLASSICS AND BEST-SELLERS by Malcolm Cowley published in the 1940 's , when the census population was 131,669,275 , and it has already reached a sale of more than 1.3 million copies , with a motion-picture edition still to come . In relative popularity , by Mott 's yardstick , it ranks not far from The Prince of the House of David . This seems to me a fair comparison , or juxtaposition , and it is quite likely that Shellabarger will find his place , not in the history of literature , but in that of publishing , with Joseph Holt Ingraham . When we come to the third book , however , Mott 's collapsible yardstick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , Leaves of Grass , appeared in the same year as The Prince of the House of David , but it had a different publishing history . Its sale before 1860 was almost certainly less than 1,000 copies . It never became a popular book during Whitman 's lifetime , and as late as 1919 the statement was made that the poet and his work were " remembered by a very few . " One of his disciples , angered by the statement , wrote to Bernard Shaw and asked for his comment . " Whitman is a classic , not a best-seller , " Shaw answered . Mott , who would like to abolish the distinction between classics and best-sellers , accuses Shaw of making unfounded assumptions . He points out that since 1919 there has been a steady increase in the popularity of Whitman 's poems , and that a single edition of Leaves of Grass , issued by Doubleday in 1940 , had a sale of more than 250,000 copies in five years , more than one percent of the population in 1850 and enough to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ingraham . But Shaw 's distinction still holds gvud . The publishing history of Leaves of Grass is enough to mark it as a " classic " in the current loose definition of the term : it is a book admired by intelligent readers through several generations . A best-seller , on the other hand , is a book purchased by many readers in one generation , like The Prince of the House of David or Captain from Castile . The making of a classic is a problem in authorship -- and readership ? that involves a complicated set of literary and human values . Making a best-seller is essentially a problem in selling . If a book is readable and a good story , its wide sales depend on non-literary factors such as timeliness , cheapness , availability and advertising . A best-seller may become a classic in time , as happened with Dickens ' novels . A classic may become a best-seller , if its sales for a century are added together , and it may even become the best-seller for a given year ; that was the case with Tolstoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timely , available , reasonable in price and pushed by an aggressive sales campaign . Thus , the two terms are not mutually exclusive ; but they are no more to be confused than darkness and durability or stoicism and sex appeal . Thai ... question . Because he fails to make a distinction between immediate popularity , based largely on sales techniques , and lasting influence based on the intrinsic qualities of a book , Mott has trouble answering what he calls ? of course ? his " $64 question . . . is there a best-seller formula ? " It should n't be even a $2 question , since there is obviously no formula that applies at the same time to Emerson and E. P. Roe , to Melville and Mrs. E. D. E. N. Southworth . One can not speak of qualities they once possessed in common , except that of being articulate mammals . Mott tries to find such qualities ; he talks at length about " certain elements of popular appeal ? as religion , sensationalism , information and guidance , adventure , democracy , humor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of best-seller history . Unfortunately the same qualities reappear in books that never became best-sellers , and in almost the same proportions . Mott is on safer ground when he forgets about literary elements and looks for sales records instead . Quite valueless as a critical work , Golden Multitudes is a storehouse of information about the book industry in the Ur.ited States . Mott , whose earlier History of American Magazines won the Pulitzer Prize in 1939 , was able to gather much of his data from sources that other students had overlooked . Here are a few familiar and unfamiliar facts that I could n't resist copying down : The all-time American best-seller is of course the Bible , of which Mott estimates that at least 200 million copies have been sold in this country , not counting New Testaments printed separately . There was probably never a year , he adds , when the Bible did n't outsell by hundreds of thousands of copies the first book on the conventional best-seller list . After it comes Webster 's blue-backed speller , with total sales approaching 60 millions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ texts ; he is trying to list the best-sellers that were distributed through conventional publishing channels . Among them the seven leaders , all with sales of more than two and one-half million copies , are Shakespeare 's Plays , Gone with the Wind , Uncle Tom 's Cabin , How to Win Friends and Influence People , Mother Goose , Ivanhoe and Ben Hur . The leading authors are Dickens , with sixteen best-sellers ; James Fenimore Cooper and Erle Stanley Gardner , with seven each ; and Sir Walter Scott , with six . Just after them come E. D. E. N. Southworth , Gene StrattonPorter and Harold Bell Wright , each of whom appears five times on Mott 's over-all list . Beginnings . The first American best-seller ? except the Bay Psalm Book , which , as a devotional work , falls outside Mott 's field of study ? was Michael Wigglesworth 's doggerel poem , The Day of Doom , published in 1662 . A Call to the Unconverted was the second ( 1664 ) ; it was a book of sermons by Richard Baxter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here before 1750 , 12 were English ; but it is perhaps more remarkable that the other eight were written in the Colonies . . . Charlotte Temple , about a sad , sad seduction , was the first American -- -or half-American ? novel to reach the all-time best-seller list . First printed here in 1794 , it was published in more than 200 editions . From 1800 ? to 1850 the American publishing industry depended largely on English books for which it paid no royalties to the authors . Mott says that " The black flag , " of literary piracy , " floated over about half of the American best-sellers . " English publishers also raised the black flag ? a little later , when there were good American books to pillage on the high seas ? with the result that Cooper , Emerson , Hawthorne and Longfellow were all mote widely read in England than in their own country . On the other hand , Scott , Dickens , Thackeray and Tennyson had by far their largest audience in the United States , where their separate works were published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per copy . The first great battle of the cheap books lasted from 1841 to 1843 . Two weekly newspapers , Brother Jonathan and the New World , began printing complete novels as monthly or semimonthly supplements and mailing them to subscribers at the newspaper rate for postage . At first the supplements were sold for 50 cents , then later , as the battle raged , the price was lowered successively to 25 , 121/2 and , in the case of shorter novels , even 61/4 cents per copy . Finally books were divided into " parts " or " numbers , " nitich were hawked in the streets for a Penny each . " Literature is now , a den , " said the editor of Brother Jonathan in April , 1843 . " All the markets are overstocked . " That same Month the Post Office Department put an end - to the battle by ruling that novels printed like newspapers could no longer be sent through the mails at the cheap newspaper rates . The second war of the cheap hooks ? there has been a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 1875 to 1893 . It started when a Chi-cago firm began to issue out-of-copy-right novels , one every fortnight , in magazine format at 10 cents apiece . This was the famous Lakeside Library and it soon had dozens of imitators : among others , the Fireside Library , the Riverside Library , the People 's Library and the Franklin Square Library . The Seaside Library issued one new bcok each day , bearing the date like a milk-bottle cap and as rapidly turning sour . Competition went to such extremes that at one period during the price war a full-length book was given as with a cake of laundry LIMISONIS . Weak as it is in its feeling for literary values , Golden Multitudes is full of lessons for publishers and commercial authors . Two of these lessons I could not fail to mention . The first is that most of the books on Mott 's list of over-all best-sellers had their largest sale in cheap editions . That was true of the nineteenth ccntury and it is equally true of the present era , when almost all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then were reprinted in one of the pocket series . The second lesson is that the market for even the cheapest books , immense as it seems , is not illimitable . Eventually it became saturated during the price wars of the past and there are signs that it is becoming saturated today . Perhaps we may be on the point of entering another era like the 1920 's , when books will be sold in comparatively small editions at luxury prices . s for individual use .
