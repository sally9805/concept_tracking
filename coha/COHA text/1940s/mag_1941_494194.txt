More than a year ago you gave me space for a 0 communication in which I ventured to plead for the entry of the United States into the war . I have now to con ? gratulate you on adopting as your editorial policy the same uncompromising position . I have nothing to add to your powerful statement of the case . But an Englishman who spent two months in your country during the past summer may be able from this experience to draw some reflections that may interest your readers . Few Americans can con ? template without alarm a future in which the United States might have to ' face a victorious Axis in isolation . But since the British Isles beat off the first attack by air , and still more since Russia became a belligerent , the fear of a total Axis victory has receded . Second , the majority of Americans believe that the manifold help they are now lavishing , short of war , is the best service they can render . The prospect before us is more hopeful than it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we may now say what General Smuts said the other day , that a total victory for Germany is impossible . Our Wand may again be bat ? tered from the air and it is still conceivable that an invasion may be attempted . We are confident that we can defend it and that we can retain command of the seas . This means at the least that we can deny to the Germans access to the trade and resources of any continent save Europe , with the perilous exception of French North Africa . But that is not victory . A compromise on this basis with such an enemy would be either a brief truce or a moral surrender . Let me say bluntly that I can not imagine either of these alterna ? tives ; there is and there will be no weakening of the will to resist ; no conceivable compromise could offer us a life worth living . We have , then , to pass from the phase of defense to the attack which will break Nazi power at its seat in the heart of Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had to discard many illusions . Some obsolete minds trusted to our financial endurance ; others exaggerated the effects of the blockade ; some were unduly elated by suc ? cesses won on the periphery , notably in Libya and the Middle East . But the illusion that still survives on both shores of the Atlantic is that the war can be won by air power alone . A bombing squadron is merely a novel and highly mobile battery of artillery . Allow what you will for its vast range of action , the fact remains that the final attack must be carried out by a land army . The most effective use of air power is as the Germans used it , first in Spain in the Ebro Valley , then in Poland and France , finally in their Eastern campaign ; that is to say , as flying artillery which blasts a way for the advancing tanks , followed in their turn by mobile infantry . If this is what the advocates of air power mean , they are wholly in the right . In other words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would add , for the adroit use of political tactics , the final victory can be won only by a mechanized army cooperating with its aerial artillery on the continent of Europe . But the belief is widely spread that the war can be won by the aerial bombardment of German factories , communi ? cations and cities . Some rely on the dislocation of the ene ? my 's industry ; others on terror . Both assume our eventual supremacy in the air . There is no doubt that much can be achieved in this way , though one might add a caution about the inaccuracy of bombing from a great height and the growing power of the defense . But it is enough to cite British experience . The Germans , with a great superiority in numbers , did their worst from September to May of the second year , and inflicted heavy losses . With gaps and interruptions , our economic life went on triumphantly : per ? haps three percent of Greater London was ruined ; our morale improved under the ordeal . What ground is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more than this ? The geographical odds are not in our favor . Our island is a small and compact target , whereas the RAF must bomb not merely the greater area of the Reich but a large part of occupied Europe as well . The Germans , with their captured airfields at our doors , are nearer to their objectives than we are to most of ours . Finally as to terror : the Germans have many faults and defects , but cowardice is not among them . Where , then , are we to find the powerful mechanized army capable of an advance upon the seat of the enemy 's power ? I need not remind the reader that the population of Greater Germany is nearly twice our own , and to this must be added , for what they are worth , the Italians and other satellites of the Axis . We have in addition the men of the Dominions and of India , but most of these , with a large part of our own army , are required to hold a scattered front that runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the entry of Russia into the war . The Red Army has fought superbly ; it has all the man power it can use , but it has lost already much of its industrial potential and may be fated to lose more . We have all re ? gretted with dismay our inability to use , this summer or fall , the chance that came to us too soon . If we could have landed a powerful army , preferably in France , while all the enemy 's shock troops with his tanks and planes were busy on the eastern front , we should not only have relieved a sorely pressed ally ; we should have shortened the war and hastened victory . It could not be done , as Lord Halifax has told you , because of the shortage of equipment ( chiefly tanks ) and shipping . A chance so fortunate may never come again . The Rus ? sians , as I write , still occupy on their long front all Ger ? many 's first-line troops . They have inflicted , but they have also suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? pends on their ability , which we yet can not measure , to hold the distributing centers of the oil on which their de ? fense and their agriculture depend . It is probable that the Germans will soon be able to transfer to , other fronts a large and growing proportion of their best troops . The longer we have to wait before we are able to land our own expedition ? ary force somewhere on the Continent , the stronger will it have to be . It is not , moreover , mere numbers that count , but a modern technique and equipment . The Ger ? mans overwhelmed France with only ten armored divisions . When we strike back , as one day we must , our armored force will be the vanguard behind which the manhood of the subject populations will fall in . If we have rifles to give them , they will hold the recovered country behind the spearhead of our advancing column and skirmish on its flanks . It is obvious , then , that a relatively modest con ? tribution of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would advance by many months the date on which this enterprise could be attempted . After spending some weeks in America , I am well aware of the resistance this suggestion will encounter in nearly every reader 's mind . Planes , tanks , food and ships by all means ; patrols and even convoys if necessary ; but not a declaration of war and , above all , not this time an expedi ? tion to Europe . That is what I heard from the pilot who brought our ship into New York Harbor , and I went on meeting that pilot wherever I traveled : he drove taxis ; he edited newspapers ; he sat in the Senate . I should have been less than human if I had failed to understand his civi ? lized scruples and his humane reluctance . I should have been grossly insensitive if I had failed to grasp the massive American tradition behind this attitude . But I listened with a picture of a wrecked city in my memory , and I was tempted to reply that Americans will be fortunate if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rational objection on which conscientious Americans rely has been ably stated in your correspondence columns . It is that if the United States , with an army as yet imper ? fectly equipped , were to enter the war as an active belliger ? ent , she would thereby delay victory instead of hastening it , since her main industrial effort would then be diverted to her own needs . This argument assumes that a declaration of war would make no change in the atmosphere , tempo and direction of American life . On that may I make my frank comment , as a traveler who passed this summer from a country at war to a country at peace , and then saw his own land again with fresh eyes ? Our British organization has had its mud ? dles , its wastes and its bottlenecks . But with all its imper ? fections it is an organization for total war . In principle no activity is tolerated , unless it directly contributes to the winning of the war , and the maintenance of civilian life at a very modest standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal . No men and few young women escape some form of service . We may dispute among ourselves whether a miner would.be better employed in getting coal or in learning to drive a tank . But no one , least of all the miner himself , considers his interests or convenience as a relevant factor in the problem . Businesses are ruthlessly closed down or amalgamated ; workers , women as well as men , are moved from one end of the country to the other in hundreds of thousands . The manufacture of such things as cars for civilian use totally ceased in the early days . Clothing , as well as food and oil , is strictly rationed ; little cloth is produced , and that only of a ' few standard kinds . At all this inconvenience no one grumbles ; on the contrary , stricter and more general rationing had been called for in the press and in Parliament long before the government im ? posed it . When the standard rate of income tax was raised to so percent , the assent , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not suggest that Americans , if they enter the war ; need go to these extremes . Your wealth and industrial re ? sources are incomparably greater than ours , as your danger is less immediate . But may I put down in plain words the impression I received during my stay ? I found myself in a country leading its normal life under boom conditions . If I know the facts , it is because you yourselves disclosed them in Congress , in the press and in reliable statistics with the customary American frankness . Left to itself , industry had raised its sales of civilian cars by 35 percent in the second year of the war , and resisted , as long as it could , a cut of 5o percent . I need hardly refer to the feeling aroused by the prolongation of the period of military training . That was wholly intelligible : why should the boys submit to another eighteen months of training , if they are never going to see active service ? To put the matter plainly , you are asking from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men will not readily make in this normal atmosphere of peace . Thatis not in your habits , nor is it in ours . The result is that the effort to contribute the maximum " short of war , " moves , as everyone concedes , more slowly than you had wished and hoped . We are now officially informed that our joint production , American and British , for defense can not equal that of the Axis until the summer of 1943 . Toward mid ? summer of this year ? the figure is doubtless a little higher now ? only 15 percent of your immense productive ca ? pacity was being utilized for defense , which includes the doubling of your own fleet as well as Supplies of all kinds for the belligerents . No ; a declaration of war would not impede your indus ? trial effort . On the contrary , it would for the first time create the heightened temperature , the sense of urgency that fuses private interests for the general good , and induces men to submit to irksome controls and personal sacrifices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be boldly used only in a state of war , America 's resources could be organized with ease to furnish more than you yet plan to supply to the British , Russians and Chinese , and in addition to equip your own army adequately . That is the first gain which we might anticipate from a declaration of war . Second , it would end any remaining obstacles to the full use of your shipping in the common cause . Third , it would reinforce the British navy , which is perilously overstrained in the many tasks it has to perform . Fourth , it would immobilize Japan . The defensive prob ? lem of the Soviet Union would become incomparably more hopeful , if she could without risk transfer her powerful Siberian army to the European front . The way to ensure this is to inform the Japanese that any attack on Russia will at once bring the American and British fleets into action against them . A firm note from Washington would in this way add more than a million first-line troops to the Allied forces . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? can declaration of war . To us and to the sorely tried Rus ? sians it would convey the certain and rational assurance of victory . To the Nazis it would bring as surely that fore ? boding of defeat which saps the courage of soldiers and relaxes the muscles of workers . The submerged peoples of Europe dared here and there to begin their revolt when they saw the Red Army in the field . How much more would they venture if they knew that America stood stripped for action at their side ? Finally , the dispatch to Europe even of a few armored divisions would hasten the end by many months . I assume that if America enters the war , she will do so because She judges that she can best secure her own lib ? erties and her future safety by fighting while the British and the Russians are still in the field . But I will venture to add a plea for urgency . As the months and years go by , the peoples of Europe must endure a slavery that grows steadily more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow up amid terror , with undernourished frames . If these conditions last much longer , the next generation will come to maturity with maimed bodies and twisted minds . I saw the misery and abnormality of Central Europe in 1919 . It bred the restless and thwarted , youth which chose in Hitler a leader who reflected its own distortions . The longer the slavery and famine last , the less confidently may we hope for a sane Continent capable of solving its own social and economic problems . We know that Amer ? ica in her generosity is preparing her stocks of food and medicine to relieve the physical misery of Europe , when war ends . Have a care lest your succor come too late . If this war should continue another two or three years , are you certain that there will be much to rescue ? Already the weak succumb : the bravest face the firing squad , while the mass submits with degraded minds , in bodies that grow daily less capable of the effort that might liberate them . What you do , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to interpret Japan 's program for the East Asia co-prosperity sphere as aiming at the immediate liberation of the oppressed races . ? Premier Tojo , as quoted in The New York Times . William Knudsen complained to Mr. Roosevelt about strikes growing out of disputes between unions and delaying defense production . The President passed the complaint along to Sidney Hillman , who is Mr. Knudsen 's associate , with the suggestion that something be done about it . ? Item from " Washington Whispers " in The United States News , October 3r , p. 48 , printed in Magazine Abstracts ( Vol . VII , No. 45 ) , published by the United States Government Reports . To the Editor : When the imagination is running low in thinking of plots or ideas for stories , a great help can be found in the society section of a paper like The New York Sunday Herald Tribune .

From The Christian Science Monitor . Praise from Sir Hubert Mr. Stalin showed joy , pleasure , satisfaction and relief on being told that we would give to Russia all the aluminum they had asked for . It seemed that a great burden had dropped off his back . I felt it my duty to say : " Mr. Churchill did it . He had the vision . That was his long-sighted view .

The New Republic will be glad to hear their opinions . ? THE EDITORS SIR : I felt a sense of shame for Mr. George Biddle when I read his " Communication " ( The New Republic , October 27 ) in which he ridicules the modern European painters who have come here as refugees , and scolds the Museum of Modern Art for extending them hospitality . Mr. Biddle , himself a painter , seems to be petrified with fear at the prospect of a few members of the School of Paris working here and exhibiting or selling their pictures through our galleries .

I have talked with a number of intelligent American artists of this development and they seem to agree that the American art world will be stimulated by it and our own stand ? ards raised . A great art movement grows out of ferment , com ? petition and give-and-take . We have become , in recent years , the leading country in muaic .
