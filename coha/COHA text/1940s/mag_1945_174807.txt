Senator Eduardo Chibas , Cuba 's pint-size , pistol-packing politico , has fought two gun duels ( nobody hurt ) and a saber duel ( one wound , Mercurochrome size ) . A fortnight ago he flourished a weapon again . During Havana 's meat riots ( TiME , June 18 ) , police used tear gas freely . Burning with indignation and clutching a small revolver ( see cut ) , the Senator dashed into the melee . " Shoot me too ! " he shouted to the police . They declined .
