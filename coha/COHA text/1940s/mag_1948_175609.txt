She went to Covent Garden ( in a black lace dress ) to hear La Traviata , and got a thundering ovation as she entered the royal box . She visited the House of Lords , was entertained by the Lord Chancellor , had tea with the Prime Minister . Once as she was entering a London hotel all the men in the crowd outside respectfully took off their hats . <P> The morning she achieved the purpose of her visit was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Square , in her black dress and coat among the pastel dresses of royalty , she walked with George VI to the towering bronze statue of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and pulled down the Union Jack that had veiled it .

" <P> In the London Times appeared a tribute to the late President by Poet Laureate John Masefield : <P> Honor this man , so stricken in his prime , So shattered in his life 's most kindling years , <P> That , had his spirit not been strong as <P> Time , <P> He could have won no tribute more <P> than tears . <P> Honor a dauntless soul and golden voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Through him , the horror passed , and we <P> rejoice , <P> Our countries are released , and Freedom <P> stands . <P> The Literary Life <P> Edgar Rice Burroughs , biographer of Tarzan , drove his Buick convertible out of the driveway of his home in Tarzana , Calif. , was thereupon struck by another Buick convertible which had just been struck by yet another Buick convertible .
