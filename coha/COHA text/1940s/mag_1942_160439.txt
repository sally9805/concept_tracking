The Rio de Janeiro Conference of American foreign ministers officially adjourned last week with ringing denunciations of Axis aggression , loud vivas for American unity . But late the night of adjournment the Peru-Ecuador border question , which had never been on the agenda but had delayed the conference windup for 24 hours ( and made all unity speeches sound slightly hypocritical ) , was still being threshed out . Not until 2 the next morning did Brazilian Foreign Minister Oswaldo Aranha , making his final attempt to please everyone , order up punch , beer , assorted fruit juices and highballs for the five key diplomats who had argued , orated , threatened , compromised and finally agreed after a four-hour session in his private office . <P> Senhor Aranha , U.S. Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles , Argentina 's Foreign Minister Enrique Ruiz Guiaz , Chile 's Juan Bautista Rossetti , Peru 's gaunt-jowled Alfredo Solf y Muro and Ecuador 's pink-cheeked Julio Tobar Donoso , each to his own taste , drank up . Still rumpled and tired , the six men filed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Baile and before glaring camera lights and sleepy-eyed newsmen signed a protocol which settled-after 113 years of intermittent border warfare-the last major inter-American boundary dispute . <P> Protocol terms gave Ecuador 30,000 of a disputed 117,000-square-mile area of the arid mountains and steaming jungleland in the upper watershed of the Amazon River . Ecuador was also given free navigation rights on the Amazon and its tributaries ( for potential oil shipments ) , but grumbled that pressure to sign had been severe . Peru did not grumble . To non-grumbling Peru Franklin Roosevelt sent a message praising " friendly consultation and mutual adjustment . " To grumbling Ecuador went praise for " the spirit of cooperation and cordial collaboration . "
