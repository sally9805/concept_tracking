THE TRAIN ( 281 pp. ) - Vera Panova-Knopf ( $3 ) . <P> <P> One of the 1946 Stalin Prizes went to a 41-year-old Russian newspaper woman named Vera Fedorovna Panova for her first novel , a story of a Red army hospital train in World War II . Published in the U.S. , The Train proves to be exceptional in recent Soviet fiction for sticking to its own tracks , with no side excursions into politics and only the rarest toots of the propaganda whistle . <P> Author Panova 's chief concern is with the inner life of the doctors , nurses and patients aboard . Her narrative jumps about from character to character , pausing to listen to the heart of each only as long as a stethoscope might , but returning again &; again until the diagnosis is assured . In this way she builds a couple of excellent character studies and one profound one . <P> One of Panova 's characters is the old party rank &; filer , now a commissar with a bleak smile and cold eye , who finds himself bewildered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is unhappy . Another is an ugly , peevish , middle-aged nurse secretly in love with feeble Dr. Suprugov . The doctor himself , a weak , cunning , vain , lying , frightened creature , might have come out of Chekhov . <P> Suprugov has forced his first wife to have an abortion for sheer terror at the thought of the fuss a child would make . In his abnormal ache for sympathy , he falsifies his dead mother as an out-all-night card player in order to make his childhood sound tragic . He flies into a rage when he is called from dinner to attend a wounded woman who is having a premature baby . And yet the author has regarded Suprugov so compassionately that the reader may feel compassion for the wretch , too . <P> The book has one serious fault : it is written so far downhill , presumably for the largest possible Russian audience , that the prose is sometimes little better than primer talk . The interesting thing about The Train is that Panova still finds the same kind of Russian characters under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
