txt Early Christmas shoppers with their parked cars jammed into illegal parking zones along the Hub 's narrow winding streets in the downtown business district are the ticket targets today for the Boston Police Department . This parking problem is becoming even more acute , said Deputy Superintendent James J. Hinchey , since thousands of marketwise shoppers are taking advantage of good weather and pre-holiday prices to get a head start on filling their Christmas stockings . " Many downtown merchants have reported to the police that their customers are eager to identify themselves as ' Christmas shoppers , ' " he added , " but the police have already found that out for themselves as they tag cars parked overtime in various downtown sections . Free from the World Series traffic duties at Fenway Park , 15 additional policemen were assigned to the tiCket squad today , said Superintendent Hinchey . They will be especially looking for cars left over the alloted time or cars parked illegally , he said . Concentration of the police effort , he stated , will be in the downtown Boston area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles River and back to Massachusetts Avenue in the Back Bay . Police have noticed that the streets lined with the greatest number of parked cars are Stuart , Tremont , South , Lincoln , and the Scollay Square area . Many of these car owners are shoppers who possibly fail to realize that they have parked over the legal limit , he said . " We are ' trying to prevent the first motorist from parking in an empty , illegal zone . If a second motorist comes along and sees another car already in the area , regardless of the signs , he sometimes thinks that the police are allowing people to park there , " Superintendent Hinchey pointed out .
