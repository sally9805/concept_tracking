For three weeks Tennessee 's Senator Kenneth McKellar , an ancient knight on a spavined horse , had roared accusations at David Lilienthal in Washington . His arena was the Senate 's Atomic Energy Committee , which was holding hearings on Lilienthal 's fitness to head the Atomic Energy Commission . McKellar was not a committee member , but the Republican majority politely let him have his way . <P> He called up old enemies of Lilienthal as witnesses . He bludgeoned him with gossip , crackpot letters , unsupported charges . He insisted on knowing the birthplace of Lilienthal 's parents , aged 72 and 78 . " It was in the vicinity of Pressburg , which is now a part of Czechoslovakia , " said Lilienthal . <P> " Czechoslovakia is under the domination of Russia , " the 78-year-old McKellar whooped in triumph . <P> Republicans , who control the Senate , did not seem to be listening . The whole thing , it seemed , might subside ; McKellar would clump off on his moth-eaten charger and Lilienthal would be confirmed . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political wind blew into the committee . It shook both parties . It agitated U.S. economics . It whistled from the dark caverns of partisanship and prejudice . <P> The Hatchetmen . Over the wind sounded the hoofbeats of Republican hatchetmen : New Hampshire 's Styles Bridges ; Nebraska 's Kenneth Wherry , the Republican whip , the ex-undertaker who wants to bury the New Deal ; Illinois ' C. Wayland ( " Curly " ) Brooks , the old isolationist ; Maine 's Owen Brewster , who is itching to investigate wartime defense contracts . They smote Lilienthal as a New Dealer , as dictatorial , as unfit for such a high position . They were not the responsible Republican leadership . But Bob Taft , who is the real and responsible G.O.P. leader , did n't say no to the hatchetmen . <P> Southern Democrats also rode the wind : McKellar 's colleague from Tennessee , Tom Stewart , a stooge of Memphis ' Boss Crump ; Louisiana 's John Overton , who had defended Theodore Bilbo six weeks ago ; Texas ' rambunctious Pappy O'Daniel . <P> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been inspired ? Harry Tru- man 's nomination of Lilienthal last fall had caused no tremor . Why now ? <P> Lilienthal had many enemies . They were opposed to him not so much for what he was-a brilliant , impatient , zealous administrator-as for what he represented . He represented the New Deal , which was their shorthand way of saying : hostility to the successful businessman , government ownership of utilities , too much government in general . <P> As boss of TVA he had opposed every attempt of Congressmen to interfere in that undertaking . TVA had forced the private power companies out of Tennessee . Power companies were applying pressure now to keep Lilienthal out of the chairmanship of AEC . <P> AEC would control more power than the world had ever known . Atomic energy might eventually replace every present source of power-coal , water or oil . An economic revolution was at hand . To lead that revolution some Republicans and some Democrats did not want David Lilienthal . Some military men did not want him either because they thought he was naive and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was another factor in the bitter equation which no one would admit but which unquestionably was there : Lilienthal was a Jew .
