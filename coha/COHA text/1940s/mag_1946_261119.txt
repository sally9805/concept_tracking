In the glossary of Hollywood , " talent " is one of the synonyms for bosom . Accordingly , Ernestine Jane Geraldine Russell , 24 , has been , as every fan-magazine reader knows , Hollywood 's most talented actress . But , except for a brief ( 1943 ) showing in San Francisco , she has never been seen on the screen . <P> Pictures of her torso have adorned the snouts of U.S. fighter planes over Buna ; U.S. sailors named her " the girl we 'd like to have waiting for us in every port . " In the five years since Producer-Aviator Howard Hughes found her in a chiropodist 's office , she has been ardently and endlessly photographed in silks and rags , in bathing suits and blankets , lying , sitting , lifting , leaning , dangling , stretching . <P> This week she could finally be seen in celluloid-not once , but twice . Hughes 's $2,500,000 The Outlaw was ready for public release ( first showing : Richmond ) . So was Young Widow , a picture Jane made for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the censors who growled after The Outlaw 's San Francisco showing ; he also did not want to be scooped by Stromberg . <P> What audiences would make of Jane 's films was still uncertain . The two pictures offered a wide choice . Young Widow , a sentimental wartime domestic drama with incidental stretches of comedy , was overwhelmingly Jane-in mourning , in love , in various stages of dress and undress . In The Outlaw , Oldtimers Thomas Mitchell and Walter Huston did their sly best with the saga of Billy the Kid . Jane , as a sulky , sexy , persistently semiclad half-breed , had a relatively minor part . <P> Critics would probably wonder whether the longest , lushest buildup in cinema history was worth it . Jane , who has privately professed a preference for interior decorating and home life ( with her husband , pro football star Bob Waterfield ) , might at long last be allowed to try them out .
