WAITING IN THE NIGHT-George Millar-Doubleday &; Co. ( $2.75 ) . <P> When the last boatload of valiant fugitives pushed off from the beach at Dunkirk , they left , among the prone bodies , the carcasses of horses , the discarded rifles and smashed cannons , a historical deposit undistinguishable from the sands that the tide washed in &; out . It was the remains of the faded Victorian Age , whose shibboleths of family security , personal freedom , humanity , honor , greatness of purpose , faith , liberalism and the intangible called decency had so long stood between civilized society and those forces within itself which are always at war with it . At one stride , a new age , The Age of Violence , had invested Europe from Asia to the Atlantic Ocean . <P> By the time the war had been pushed back violently toward the dark heart of Europe , there was scarcely a peaceful family , particularly in France , which had not shared the new experience of violence and conspiracy . Sharing it with them was a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposeful man of action typified by the Resistance leaders and the British and American officers who lived with them and helped them . In one of the most exciting and intelligent books produced by World War II , one of these British officers , Captain George Reid Millar , has described his experiences as an area leader of the French Resistance . Captain Millar has the face of a fanatic without a dogma ( this made it possible for him to lead a forlorn hope ) . He also has a sense of the absurd , which makes it difficult for him to take seriously the politics of the Right or the Left . This helps to keep his report of the Resistance in focus as a patriotic ( rather than a social ) uprising . <P> In the Aquarium . The year was 1944 . The place was a vast , dirty , cobwebbed " aquarium " of a room in a London house , which served as the British headquarters of the French Resistance . Here George Millar was interviewed as a candidate to be parachuted into France . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I wanted a useful death and then peace . . .. I was thirty-three and so unhappy that life was almost sense-free , almost sensation-free. " * <P> Millar was accepted for Resistance work . At first he was just barked at by his superiors or kept cooling his heels in the dirty waiting room filled with dated copies of the Daily Express and France Libre . But if he was not on time , he was barked at louder : " Handsome Mrs. Pollock would glower at me from behind her **26;9033;TOOLONG desk , and her pneumatic Jane , the American secretary in uniform , would pretend to be engrossed in her typing , so that she could spare no sympathy . " A major warned him : " Please be careful , my friend . You must not give a false impression of slackness you know . You are being trained for a position of great responsibility . Punctuality is considered most vital in this organization . We demand the most absolute discipline and obedience . "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
