In July , dysentery spread through Berlin . The disease was carried by flies that swarmed in the wreckage , and struck an undernourished people : 705 died of it . In August came typhoid fever , which also flourishes on flies and filth . In the week of Aug. 18 there were 538 typhoid cases ( up from 43 in July ) and 50 deaths . ( So far , no U.S. soldier has caught typhoid . ) Last week the U.S. Army took on the immense job of immunizing all 900,000 civilians in its zone against typhoid and paratyphoid ( similar to typhoid , but milder ) . In doing so , the U.S. hoped that the British , French and Russians , who have charge of the 2,100,000 other Berliners , would take the hint and do likewise .
