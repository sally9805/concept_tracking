In the key election in Oklahoma 's second District , Democrat William G. Stigler ( a half-Choctaw ) beat Republican Edwin Oliver Clark ( a quarter-Choctaw ) for Congress by 3,700 votes . The election was advertised as a crucial test of whether the long Republican trend could be stopped ( TIME , March 27 ) . Both sides had poured in money and big-gun campaign speakers . <P> Tone of the G.O.P. campaign was set by rich , aging Senator Ed H. Moore , who used to be a Democrat until he sickened of the New Deal . Cried he : " I hate and detest the New Deal with all my soul . It is a destructive vice in America . I want it eradicated completely . " Replied big-gun Democrat , Kentucky 's Alben Barkley : " I just asked them what part of the New Deal they would vote against . . . social security , the wage-hour act , bank insurance , soil conservation and all the rest . " <P> Two things happened : 1 ) Democrats , sparked by Governor Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for votes ; 2 ) Republicans , with the campaign largely handled by anti-New Deal and ex-Democrats , went far too far . They alarmed even some of their own party with the bitterness of the Hate-the-New-Deal campaign . <P> Democrats crowed over the result. * From the realistic , anti-Roosevelt New York Daily News , Republicans got hard-headed advice : " Republicans would do well not to console themselves too nonchalantly with alibis . This defeat ought to remind them that the fight to defeat a Roosevelt fourth term is not over by a long shot . " To the G.O.P. , the lesson was clear - hatred is not enough . <P> *Reverberations reached as far as Moscow , whose press , addressing millions who had never heard of Oklahoma , let alone its Second District , gave prominence to the election result , and interpreted it as a pre-election approval of Franklin Roosevelt .
