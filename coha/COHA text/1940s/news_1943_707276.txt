txt United States Liberator bombers , flying a round trip of nearly 2,500 miles from their African bases , dumped more than 330,000 pounds of high explosives in daylight yesterday on a German aircraft factory at Wiener Neustadt that has been credited with production of a third of all the Messerschmitt fighters used by the Nazi Air Force . Catching enemy defenses completely by surprise , the four-motored bombers completed the long trip to the Danube River city , twenty-seven miles south of Vienna , with every plane " accounted for , " a communiqu ? from United States Ninth Air Force headquarters here announced . An official Swiss report late Friday said an American bomber , which now appears to have been one of the Wiener Neustadt raiders , landed that day in eastern Switzerland and the crew of ten was interned . British bombers hit Northern Italy again last night . Reports from Switzerland indicated that Milan and Turin were pounded heavily once more . Returning airmen said bomb bursts blanketed the factory , machine shops and the great U-shaped assembly plant that covered 1,339,000 square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Axis , was said to have assembled Messerschmitt 109s at the rate of 400 a month . " Direct hits were scored upon factory buildings and large columns of smoke were seen rising throughout the target area , " said the Ninth Air Force communique , which termed the Liberator fleet a " large force " and described the aircraft factory as " important . " " Scores of bursts were seen among some 400 fighter aircraft parked in rows along the ground , " the report added . Although the trip was the longest ever made into Axis Europe // LIBERATORS WRECK PLANT IN AUSTRIA // by bombers based in the Middle East and their first into Adolf Hitler 's Greater Germany ( Wiener Neustadt is in Austria ) , reports of returning fliers indicated that no more than fifteen enemy fighters arose to challenge them and some crews saw no enemy planes at all . One Messerschmitt 109 was shot down . An American military spokesman said : " Weiner Neustadt is only 200 miles south of the deepest point of penetration into Axis Europe from England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immune to attack by air . " The destruction of this factory , he said , would strike a crippling blow at the Nazis ' already waning air power . With the enemy resigned to defensive strategy and his bomber production on a sharp decline , fighter plane production at the Wiener Newstadt plant was believed to have been increased considerably in recent months . The American fliers , all of whom reported very slight anti-aircraft and fighter opposition , said the bomb hits raised red and yellow flames that billowed 500 feet high or more , with black clouds of smoke towering thousands of feet higher . Twelve-Hour Flight Called Easy Capt . Kenneth Caldwell of Kansas City , Kan. , whose b mber , The Scorpion , led the raid , said his crew did not sight a single enemy plane . Although the mission took more than twelve hours , Captain Caldwell described it as " one of the easiest I ever Lad been on . " Col. Edward J. Timberlake , the raid commander , also was aboard The Scorpion . " We were first over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from what I could see , " said Colonel Timberlake . " As we turned away I saw innumerable bursts on the target " The commander was greeted upon his return by a brother , Brig . Gen. Patrick W. Timberlake of the Mediterranean Air Command headquarters . Both Timberlakes are from San Antonio , Tex . " I saw only one Axis fighter all day and that was over Italy on the way home , " Tech . Sgt. Peter Rice of New York said . Sgt , Clyde Keeling of Tulsa , Okla. , who took part in the Ploesti oil-field raid , remarked : " What next ? Rumania and now Austria  --  and we are based in North Africa ! " We were in the second group so we could see the damage done by the first group . The factory was hit squarely . I saw many 109s on the ground . I could see smoke and many fires all over the target area . It was a hell of a long trip , but well worth it "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
