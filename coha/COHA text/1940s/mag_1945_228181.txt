Two masters of the art of umpire-baiting met in Pittsburgh last week . As they and their hardy apprentices tangled with two baitable Men in Blue , the sound &; fury easily cleared the fences of Forbes Field . <P> It began in the first inning of a four-game series between the rowdy Pittsburgh Pirates and the noisy Brooklyn Dodgers . Umpire George Barr called Pirate Bob Elliott out at home , and got not-too-gently pushed for his pains . He promptly ordered Elliott out of the game . When Manager Frank ( ex- " Fordham Flash " ) Frisch hurled a caustic comment from the bench , he too got the royal thumb . Elliott drew a $50 fine from National League president Ford Frick ; Frisch was fined $75 . <P> In the second game Brooklyn 's Luis Olmo objected , more or less politely , to a strike called by Umpire Tom Dunn . Olmo : " You missed that one . " Dunn : " You shut up . " Olmo : " I wo n't shut up . " That finished Olmo ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , Manager Leo ( " The Lip ' ' ) Durocher also got the heave-ho . The Pirates , long experienced in treading the paths of banishment , began laying a carpet of towels for the Lip 's exit . Durocher gave the towels a few kicks , then reached into a box of baseballs and scattered the pellets down the right-field foul line . Fine : $100 . <P> The third day , Dodger Augie Galan got tossed for kicking dirt at Umpire Barr ( fine : $50 ) . Dixie Walker followed-for flinging his glove in the air in disgust ( no fine ) . In the final game , Brooklyn 's hotheaded Ed Stanky had his $50 's worth of fun . He threw his hat high in the air after a called third strike , and Umpire Barr again did his duty as he saw it-thereby setting a new record for canning players from consecutive games .
