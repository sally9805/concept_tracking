Fruit or vegetable ? For a Buffalo court last week that was the barb in rhubarb . U.S. canners who import rhubarb from Canada want to call it a fruit , subject to a 35% duty . The U.S. Customs Department wants to go on calling it a vegetable , subject to a 50% duty . <P> The court gave customs and canners 60 days to do their classifying , but in Canada a Government expert tried to be helpful . " A vegetable , " explained Dr. F. L. Drayton , Dominion botanist , gravely , " is simply a piece of vegetation . A fruit , on the other hand , results from fertilization of the flower . Botanically speaking , tomatoes and eggplants are fruits . So are pumpkins and peanuts . " <P> But rhubarb ? The doctor pondered . " The part eaten is the stalk . Hence it is really a petiole , like a Swiss chard . " Suddenly the doctor smiled . " At the Dominion Experimental Farm we 'd get round it by calling it a field crop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
