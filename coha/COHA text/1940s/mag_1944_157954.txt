The Lamb of God , an ancient symbol dear to most Christians , is an offensive notion to the Japanese . To them the lamb is " a dirty , stupid and cringing animal . " The word lamb is " an epithet of contempt and derision . . . perhaps the vilest word in the language . " Thus , in Christianity and Crisis last week , wrote George S. Noss , Japan-born son of U.S. missionaries , himself a missionary in rural Japan for eleven years , now a teacher of Japanese at Columbia University . His thesis : the reason Christian missionaries to Japan have converted only one-half of 1% of the population is largely that they have presented Christianity in terms incomprehensible or repellent to the Japanese . <P> For the lamb , ex-Missionary Noss would substitute the mirror popular in Shinto temples . Says he : " For the Japanese , Jesus the Mirror of God would be a tremendous symbol . " He would also adopt the cherry blossom as a Christian symbol . <P> To Japanese , cherry blossoms are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Japanese , he declares , never feel at home in " the ugly and incongruous West ern chapel , " or " even in a fine Gothic church . " He recommends that future Christian churches in Japan be built in " the shrine form of architecture , with its clean lines and austere beauty . " He would even have the churches include the Buddhist torn ( ceremonial gateway ) . The churches should not stand on streets , but be " hidden in groves of trees with torn and mossy stone steps , fountains of water , and old flowering shrubs . " He also ' recommends drastic changes inside the buildings . Noss says the Japanese are repelled by a minister who " wears a frock-coat sort of dress , and often walks about the church chancel in his stocking feet . " He would have ministers borrow " the clean and flowing blue-and-white robes of the Shinto priests . " Bible translations are in language that the average Japanese does not understand . <P> They should be revised in modern idiom . <P> Hymns also need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washed in the blood of Jesus . " The Japanese like nature hymns . <P> Noss would also discard the Western collection plate , substitute a wooden box at the door . Says he : " The Japanese do not have our matter-of-fact attitude to ward money . For example , to give a tip to a hotel maid by handing her the cold and bare coins is to show one 's lack of breeding ; one will wrap the money in clean white paper , and if possible put this little parcel on a tray . Perhaps the Christian people are used to it now , but lifting the offering to the sound of clinking and jingling coins is often quite shocking to the casual visitor . "
