THE EGG AND I-Beffy MacDonald-Lippincott ( $2.75 ) . <P> That loud literary cackle last week was not only Betty MacDonald 's , whose The Egg and I is leading U.S. nonfiction lists . It was also her readers ' , who were finding her account of life on a primitive Oregon chicken ranch one of the funniest books ever written about chickens , friends and neighbors . <P> Author MacDonald , thirtyish , was born ( in Boulder , Colo. ) while her father , a mining engineer , was away from home . So grandmother ( " Gammy " ) , " prompted by the same inner urge which made her wear her corsets upside down " with the bust fitting snugly around her hips , rushed out and fetched a veterinary . He had retired for the night and arrived breathless , clad only in his long underwear . Her mother sent him packing , with the result that Author MacDonald was born without medical assistance . <P> It was Gammy who really prepared Author MacDonald for her adult life in the wilds . Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger and " were always walking logs over deep terrible ravines ; walking into black dangerous mine tunnels ; wading into swift turbulent streams and doing other scary things . Gammy , on the other hand , carefully avoided danger and was constantly on the alert for it . " In the sweltering summer Gammy shut the doors and windows against the dangers of mountain air . At the first clap of thunder she and the children would hurtle under the bed . On walks they would stop every few feet to listen for rattlesnakes . She was also on guard against eagles , hawks , bees , horseflies , mosquitoes , ticks , leeches , timber wolves and mountain lions . " We children , of course , never told brave , fearless Mother and Daddy about Gammy and the dangers of outdoor life , and they probably wondered why they , so strong and daring , should have produced this group of high-tensioned rabbits . " <P> But Mother also made a fatal contribution to her daughter 's future . " Along with teaching us that lamb must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head or spits , my mother taught my sisters and me that it is a wife 's bounden duty to see that her husband is happy in his work . ... It is depressing enough for a man to know that he has to work the rest of his life without the added burden of knowing that it will be work he hates ! " <P> Holy Grail . So when Author MacDonald married Bob , an exmarine , who seemed to be well established in the insurance business , she decided to learn about length of premiums , renewals and actuarial climacterics . But on the honeymoon Bob began to talk about hens . " When he reached the figures-the cost per hen per egg , the cost per dozen eggs , the relative merits of outdoor runs , the square footage required per hen-he recalled them with so much nostalgia that listening to him impartially was like trying to swim at the edge of a whirlpool . " " Why in God 's name , " cries Author MacDonald , " does everyone want to go into the chicken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holy Grail ? "
