This week , on Sept. 22 , the sun reaches the autumnal equinox . At that moment in its apparent southward motion it crosses the celestial equator , stands vertically over the earth 's equator . And that moment will be heralded by many a U. S. newspaper as summer 's end . Thereupon Physicist William Warner Sleator of the University of Michigan will get mad again . <P> For a long time 57-year-old Professor Sleator , whose specialties are optics and spectroscopy , has bottled up his irritation when he read glib squibs about spring " beginning " on March 21 , or summer " beginning " on June 21 . Last week he blew the cork off with a letter to Science captioned " What is Summer ? " There is no reason in nature , logic or language , declared Professor Sleator , why the seasons should be bounded by the two equinoxes and the two solstices . He wants summer to be June , July and August ; autumn , September , October , November ; and so on for winter and spring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we speak by inheritance means the warm season . A dictionary definition is ' the hottest or warmest season of the year , including June , July and August in the northern hemisphere . ' . . . Moreover , so people have written English in poetry and prose . ' No price is set on the lavish summer , June may be had by the poorest comer . ' June , not just June 21 to 30 . . . . " <P> The press , taking no notice of Professor Sleator 's blowoff , prepared to report summer 's demise on Sept. 22.
