txt Leaders in the nation 's construction industry hailed the Oct. 15 lifting of Federal controls on building here today as the speedy way to meet the nation-wide housing shortage . now seen as reaching acute proportions in New York , Chicago , and Los Angeles , though hardly less serious in other urban cen tern . However , whether this would " I prove the least expensive way to meet the problem remained very much an open question with some expressing the opinion here that the Government 's action lifted the lid i b ( Sth on building and prices . i That it would expedite reconversion in the budding industry , which normally accounts for about 12 per cent of the nation 's total jemployment , was generally agreed . 1 The backlog of new building required at this time to catch up to the housing demand was placed here today at a low of $50,000 , - 000,000 and a high of $75,000,000 , - 1000 . Both figures are unprecedented in United States history . Some idea of the size of this backlog may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in new building reached during the postwar period in the early 1920s . When the boom collapsed in the 1930s it was computed that no fewer than 11,000,000 men and women were thrown out of work . Three Question Marks It would be idle and dangerous to speculate with these figures and try to estimate the employment that the building industry may furnish in coming years . Suffice it to say that every sign indicates high-speed activity for the next five to ten years , with salutary effects on the general economy . ? There are , it must be said , at least three question marks : 1 . Will prices be too high ? 2 . Will continued rent controls discourage apartment house building ? 3 . What of materials ? The last , materials , is seen as only a temporary problem . Lumber is the most-short item . Manufacturers of such things as bathtubs are saying that new products are already coming off the line , but are asking where they can get lumber to crate them . Shortage of Heavy Timbers However , military lumber cutbacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the timbering employment picture it is expected this situation will ease . It is tightest just now , according to builders in the heavy timbers needed for framing and for sills and beams . Bricks are short , so is steel , iron , copper , but , again , military cutbacks should brighten this picture rapidly . The second problem , rent controls , is one that apartment house builders are wrestling with . It is stated flatly by several large operators here that they can not start new building of apartment units in New York while rent controls remain . On the other hand , there is strong consumer pressure for retention of rent controls . Prices are not fixed on new house construction , but some builders feel that the prices are bound to be quite high and that some buyers will hold back waiting for a leveling . Judging from the present activity in the inflated house market this is a groundless fear . Which Size ' Houses ? Some disappointment was ex- , pressed here in labor circles that the Government 's action in lifting all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more expensive types of houses , forgetting the little man . Previous rulings had allowed priorities on material only for lowercost housing . There is probably some foundation in fact for this , since the market seems as lively for bigger houses as for small ones , and , of course , the profits are larger , per unit , on the more expensive home construction . On the other hand , large-scale , mass production house building methods lend themselves to lower-priced , more standardized houses , where the profits are made on volume rather than units , and it is hoped that more of this type of activity will be stimulated . Some have looked to prefabrication as bringing in a new era of such building . But those in the construction supply business here point out that the war years have brought a gradual lessening of the gap between factory wages and the wages paid the , organized skilled construction trade workers . It was , they point out , the former much cheaper wages in factories that gave pre-fabrication its cost edge . With the tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is claimed . However . United States Steel recently knnounced considerable expansiOn in its orders for Gunnison pre-fah houses . So the last word may not yet have been heard on the subject .
