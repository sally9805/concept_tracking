The U.S. had merely stuck a toe in the water by announcing last fortnight , outside of U.N. , its polite but determined proposal for sole trusteeship of strategic Pacific Islands . Soviet Russia had muttered a procedural objection , but otherwise the water was not too cold . Last week Prime Minister Jan Smuts of the Union of South Africa took a full plunge . He found the water icy . Nineteen nations denounced his plan for annexation of South-West Africa. * Only Britain , grateful to Smuts for South Africa 's support in two wars , supported him . <P> Said Soviet Delegate Nikolai Novikov : " The Soviet delegation . . . rejects the proposal . . . and will insist that the Government of the Union of South Africa . . . submit ... a draft agreement on trusteeship over South-West Africa . " <P> But could Smuts be compelled to submit a draft ? Article 77 of the U.N . Charter said the " trusteeship system shall apply to such territories as may be placed thereunder . . . . " <P> Clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.N . trusteeship instead of outright annexation , Byelorussia 's delegate Frol P. Shmigov was ready to argue that South Africa 's policies of racial discrimination ( TIME , Nov. 4 ) had proved it ' ' incapable of being a trustee . " <P> Sir Maharaj Singh , Indian delegate , took up the cudgels , traded blows with Smuts through two heated speeches . To Smuts 's claim that Africans were represented in the Union Government , Singh trumpeted : " Africans ( 75% of the population ) have only seven representatives out of 200 in the Legislature , and even then they can only be represented by Europeans . " To Smuts 's claim that trusteeship would be a violation of the " clear wishes of the inhabitants " as expressed in recent consultations , Singh ( and the Russians ) expressed a doubt shared by many observers in the Western democracies . On file with the U.N . Secretariat was a cablegram from Chief Festus Kandjou of the Herero tribe ( pop . 28,000 ) : " Please record that the whole Herero nation of South-West Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union of South Africa . . . . " But in neither South nor South-West Africa were the majority of the Negroes yet ready for citizenship . Most humanitarians recognized that , but criticized the South African Government for doing little or nothing to raise native standards toward self-government . Thousands still live primitively in the bush , a prey to disease and malnutrition , relieved occasionally by excessive feasting . <P> " Is That So ? " In Manhattan 's crowded Waldorf-Astoria a most unprimitive citizen confronted Smuts . Ebony , pint-sized Dr. Alfred B. Xuma ( pronounced Kooma with a deep , clicking tch on the K ) , president of the African National Congress , enjoyed his part of the ensuing dialogue : <P> Smuts : " Xuma ! Why are you here ? " <P> Xuma ( smiling ) : " I came to be near my Prime Minister . " <P> Smuts ( putting a friendly hand on Xuma 's shoulder ) : " Why have n't we got together before ? " <P> Xuma : " I 've been trying to get together with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even know what we Africans think . " <P> Smuts : " Is that so ? "
