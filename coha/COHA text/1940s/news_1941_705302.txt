txt All aid to ? Britain consistent with lour own defense needs , but not to ithe point where our entry into the conflict becomes inevitable , was urged last night by Joseph P. Kennedy , retiring United States Ambassador to Great Britain , in a thirtyminute broadcast to the nation over a national network . He declared against passage of the lend-lease bill now before Congress on the ground that the danger was not immediate enough to justify what he called " this surrender of the authority and responsibility of the Congress . " The United States can best serve itself and the world , he said , if it will preserve democracy at home and continue to build up its defenses to a point where no nation dares attack us . He saw no danger of an immediate attack by the dictator nations and no possibility of a successful invasion of this hemisphere  --  north or south  --  at any future time if we immediately go " all out " in our armament program . " I do not pretend that by staying at peace our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I do assert that by staying at peace we will be in a far better position to meet the gigantic problems we must face . Mr. Kennedy made his broadcast from a small speaker 's studio in the National Broadcasting Company offices in the RCA Building , Rockefeller Center , with only Mrs. Kennedy , their daughter , Patricia , and Mr. Kennedy 's secretary , Edward Moore , present . In declaring against passage of H. R. 1776 , the lend-lease ? bill , the Ambassador who saw at first hand the operation of authority in wartime Britain said that although he was a great believer in centralized responsibility , he believed that less drastic ways of meeting the problem of adequate authority for the President could be found . Mr. Kennedy had announced yesterday that he was going to Washington Tuesday to testify before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the Lease-Lend Bill but he said after the broadcast that he had no specific amendments to propose . " I 'm just going down to answer questions , just like every one else , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the committee . Mr. Kennedy denied vehemently that he was an " appeaser , " that he wanted the war to end on other than British terms or that he would place any faith in a peace offer coming from the dictators . He denied also that he was a " defeatist. ' as to the chances of Britain to win . He said he had reported to this government the seriousness of the problem facing Britain but that be had never predicted its defeat , that the issue depended on more factors than he had knowledge of . Among // KENNEDY FAVORS LESS DRASTIC BILL // these factors he listed German morale , or lack of it , German military strength , the answer to why Germany had not attacked more British industrial towns on the Coventry pattern , or more heavily bombed Britain 's vital ports of entry . The morale of the British nation , he said , " defies description . " If he could be assured that an unprepared America , by declaring war on Germany could , within the space of a year , end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor of such a declaration right now , he declared . The truth is we are not prepared to wage an offensive war against Germany , he said , and the prospect of what would happen in a long-drawn out conflict with only Soviet Russia of the great powers on the sidelines , frightened him . Mr. Kennedy also spoke out against what he said was a commonly used argument , that we must enter the war on Britain 's side because she is fighting our battle . " England is not fighting our battle , " he said . " This is not our war . We were not consulted when it began . We had no veto power over its continuance . England 's own leaders have told us why they are fighting . They are fighting for their very existence . " It does happen that England 's spirited defense is greatly to our advantage . It is true  --  she is waging a war against a force which seeks to destroy the rule of conscience and reason , a force that proclaims its hostility to law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Therefore , we ought to arm to the teeth and give as much help as we can . But let us do it on the basis of American ideals and interests . " Mr. Kennedy did not particularize as to the nature or extent of the aid he felt this country was capable of giving to Britain , saying he believed that could best be determined by the President and his military advisers . As to the financing of this aid , he said Britain should pay up to the limit of her resources , but after that what aid we extend should be outright grants , " since I would not expect that loans could be repaid . " In an apparent answer to recent charges that the counsel of himself and of Ambassador Bullitt at Paris may have had something to do with British and French declarations of war on Germany Sept. 3 , 1939 , Mr. Kennedy declared that he had opposed the war . " I opposed the war , " he said , " because I believed that the day Europe went to war , regardless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute on became critical . " Mr. Kennedy made only one mention of Premier Churchill 's speech of the night before at Glasgow . Discussing the question of whether we could enter the war and not use our manpower , he said that " only yesterday Mr. Churchill said , ' We do not require in 1941 large armies from overseas . ' Does that mean , " Mr. Kennedy asked , " our boys are expected over there in 1942 ? " Mr. Kennedy ended his broadcast on the optimistic note that he believed the great majority of Americans were against our entry into the war . " If the leaders keep constantly before them what war , means in terms of human tragedy , " he continued , " it Congress is ever alert to the dangers of involvement , the national determination will be translated into effective action and this country will not go to war .
