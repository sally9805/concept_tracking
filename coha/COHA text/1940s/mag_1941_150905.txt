Ten years ago , a gentle , dark-eyed boy of 17 stabbed his mother 32 times with a bread knife . He was quite intelligent : he worked night &; day , in school , in a bakery and tending his fatherless brothers and sisters . Everyone in the neighborhood liked and respected him . <P> Why did Gino kill his mother ? This problem intrigued famed Manhattan Psychiatrist Frederic Wertham . He had examined many insane murderers* , but Gino fitted none of the classic descriptions . Besides , matricide is probably the rarest form of murder . This week , in a fascinating popular book , Dr. Wertham revealed the secret of Gino 's personality ( Dark Legend : A Study in Murder ; Duell , Sloan &; Pearce ; $2.75 ) . <P> Gino 's tragedy , Dr. Wertham discovered , paralleled almost exactly the old Greek myth of Orestes , the prince who killed his mother , was later pursued by the Furies . ( The doctor also introduced a unique , well-documented interpretation of Hamlet : his main ambition , too , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were Italian , very affectionate to each other and their children . But after Gino 's father died , his mother changed . She neglected her children , had an affair with their uncle Aiello ( Hamlet 's Claudius ) , who used to beat them . Although Gino hated Aiello , he did not retaliate , for in his mind only his mother was guilty . After Aiello , his mother became promiscuous . <P> When he was eleven , Gino determined to kill her . After six years of wrestling with his inhibitions , he rushed into her bedroom with the knife . As soon as he killed her , he felt relief from tremendous tension . <P> Obvious to amateur Freudians is the fact that Gino had an Oedipus complex , was in love with his mother . He was prudish toward girls , shied away from sex experience . But , contrary to Freud 's definition , he did not consider his father a rival-in fact he identified himself with him as the head of the family , and had the same feelings as a jealous husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not explain the act of murder . Many men , says Dr. Wertham , have matricidal impulses , never translate them into action . Instead they bury the desire in their subconscious , develop compulsion neuroses-a morbid dread of knives , persistent symbolic hand-washing , etc . If he had had a tendency toward ordinary forms of insanity , Gino might have killed himself instead of his mother . Or he might have withdrawn to the world of fantasy , developed schizophrenia . <P> Instead , not understanding his powerful sex urge , he convinced himself that his mother had disgraced the family honor . He had been brought up among people who consider it right to punish someone who disgraces the family-Gino never thought he was doing wrong . <P> Dr. Wertham 's conclusion : Gino 's murder of his mother was a safety valve , an act to preserve his sanity . If he had not killed his mother , he would have gone mad . Said the doctor : " Gino acted like a man who cuts off his arm to escape blood poisoning . By the cruel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a violent act to release a neurosis Dr. Wertham calls " catathymic crisis . " It accounts , says he , for many murders committed by otherwise sane persons . After the temporary aberration they may have a good chance of returning to sanity again .
