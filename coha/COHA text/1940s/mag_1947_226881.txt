For him , Springfield was more than the prosy , prosperous seat of Illinois ' State Fair ; he saw it as a cultural capital of the future , where art would some day vie with corn , hogs and cattle for attention .

" The man who painted the sorry sight had also contributed a lithographic Self Portrait ( which won $50 ) . It was better-dressed but no better-fleshed than Dorian . " That fellow , " confided one bemused farmer , " looks just like a dried up crab apple under my tree back home . " Said another : " The funniest thing I ever saw . "
