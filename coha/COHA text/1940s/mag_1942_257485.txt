WPB men who think that subcontracting will win the war were talking last week about an ingenious new mechanical scheme to increase subcontracting . Its author is a fast-talking , high-domed , ex-filling station owner from Richmond , Va . named James S. Stanley , who has a passion for punch cards and Hollerith sorting machines . He was last heard of eight years ago as the founder of the Leisure League of America , to which he contributed suggestions for 700 ways to kill time . But his own hobby has always been work . <P> Jim Stanley 's idea grew out of a subcontractor hunt he conducted for Floyd Odium 's Contract Distribution Office last summer . The big gap between sub-and prime contractors , he found , was ignorance . The small manufacturer could not find out just what the big one wanted , or even who he was ; the big fellow could not find out what the small fry had to offer . In his talks with the small fry , Stanley decided that they needed to know only a few basic facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials to be handled , 2 ) the type of machines required , 3 ) the number of machine-hours per job , 4 ) the operation expected of the machine , 5 ) the weight of the part to be machined . If there were an alphabetical code to express these facts , any man with a machine could look up its war uses like a number in the phone book . <P> With the help of the Army &; Navy Munitions Board , Stanley coded every kind of U.S. defense machine ( about 4,000 ) . There were just enough letters in the alphabet to fit 26 classes of machine , from A for boring to Z for miscellaneous . More specific descriptions ( size , type , etc. ) were assigned letters too . DAB , for example , means D for milling machine , A for knee-type , horizontal , universal , B for No. 2 light-type-all of which is plain English to the man who owns one . The other four basic facts are similarly keyed with numerals and other letters . <P> Once the code is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of his job he wants help on . The U.S. Census Bureau 's Hollerith machines take this alphabet soup and turn it into a directory . Thumbing this directory to see where his machines belong , a would-be subcontractor can then write the prime contractor ( whose name is also coded ) for detailed plans , make a firm bid for the work . <P> Stanley 's first guinea-pig prime contractor was Westinghouse Electric &; Manufacturing Co . The first " Directory of Contract Opportunities " was ready in December . It contained 132 coded jobs to be done , and soothing instructions on how to use it ( " Do n't take one look at this directory and then decide it is too complicated . . . . Anyone who can read a telephone book can read this " ) . Jim Stanley and Westinghouse Production Engineer S. W. ( " Bill " ) Schmidt went to Indianapolis , where a pool of 15 local factories and shops had agreed to try the plan in a small way . Bill Schmidt was a cagey tester , did not show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factories had doped out the directory properly on their own hook . But in ten days he had signed ten contracts .
