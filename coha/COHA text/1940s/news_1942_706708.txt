txt Mayor La Guardia , urging over the radio last night that all in the metropolitan area spend their Labor Day week-end in New York City , announced ' that elaborate arrangements for parking of visitors ' cars had been completed . The south sides of all cross-town streets , from ' Fortieth to Fifty-third Street , from Third to Ninth Avenue , have been set aside for parking purposes , he said , plus the south sides of Thirtyfifth and Thirty-sixth Streets , from Third to Sixth Avenue , and the south side of Thirty-seventh Street , from Third to Seventh Avenue . In addition , free parking lots , where the cars will be guarded by attendants , have been set up at the terminals of all subway lines in Queens and the Bronx . " The idea is that you can park your car there and ride down town for a nickel , Comfortably or uncomfortably , depending on the hour you pick , but you 'll get there , fast and safely . " the Mayor said . He announced also that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will insure a ' real treat to all who come . The first of these is a series of bargain sales that will be put on by the big stores . He urged the listeners to watch their newspapers for the advertisements . The second is that all hotel and restaurant men have assured him that there will be no increase in their prices . " New York City is n't a hick town . We do n't jump our prices just because the county fair is in town . And the food and accommodations are excellent . " The Mayor , who was introduced over WOR with " The Halls of Montezuma , " alternately waxed lyrical and boyish in his outline of the charms that New York City has to offer . He offered to bet his audience a nickel that they had not been to the Statue of Liberty , and told those with- weak hearts to stay away from the Giant-Dodger games on Saturday and Sunday . For those who want to serve in the Commandos , however , he recommended a " Durocher sortie at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City Has " Everything " The theme of the Mayor 's address was that the city has everything , swimming in the surf at the various beaches ; swimming in fresh water at city pools ; rustic atmosphere in the many parks ; urban amusements at their very best in the eighteen legitimate shows on Broadway , the movies and ball games ; music galore with free concerts in all of the parks ; pageantry and patriotism at the big labor rally in Central Park on Sunday , and countless other attractions that he rattled off at the rate of about fifteen a minute . And all of this , he made it clear , either free or at regular cost , and much more comfortably than the same things can be done in the country . He had urged his wife to do some shopping , and she said she was waiting for bargains , which led him to make the special arrangements with the stores , the Mayor revealed . ' Bring the kids and get them shoes , or else the shoes might not fit . I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Sears , Roebuck or Montgomery Ward , and they never fit , " the Mayor recalled , just before turning over the microphone at the end of his address . Stores Arrange Bargains The arrangements with the large stores were completed by the Mayor yesterday afternoon , at a City Hall conference with Frederick Gimbel of Gimbel Brothers , William Howard of R. H. Macy &; Co. , and Ira Hirschmann of Bloomingdale Brothers , inc . " We had a brief but important meeting , " the Mayor said . " These store men feel as I do that New York is the greatest city in the world and offers its residents and its visitors the greatest variety of entertainment and recreation possible . In addition to the amusements , the department stores themselves are big drawing cards . At the conference this morning , arrangements were made to offer the public some of the greatest bargain attractions that New York has ever seen . " I learned from these men that their stores , as well as other large stores in the city , have been stocking their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer the public the fruit of their buying power at unusually moderate prices . " I have already announced a long list of interesting things to do in New York over this Labor Day week-end . Further announcements will be made of any other special events that may be arranged .
