" You 'll Find God . . . Right in There , " screamed the bannerline , and the curly-haired little girl in the ad pointed straight at the title , The Lawton Story , " A Picture That Does Something to Your Soul . " As the film went into release last week , the two live-wire Ohio promoters who made it were confident that religion would serve them as well at the box office as sex has done since 1945 . <P> Sex has done right well by Producers Kroger Babb and J. S. Jossey . Their only other movie , a feature-length sex education film called Mom and Dad , has quietly taken in $8,000,000 from 20 million moviegoers . For the last four years , it has been strenuously peddled in 42 states and Canada . <P> Only the Livestock . Now being shown in Latin America and Australia and still going strong in the U.S. , Mom and Dad is a knowing mixture of syrup , spice and corn . It blends scenes of childbirth , a Caesarean operation and the ravages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who " got into trouble " because her parents kept her in ignorance . ( Catch lines : " It Happens Somewhere Every Night , " " Millions Learned the Hard Way , But You Can See the Facts . " ) <P> Producer Babb , sparkplug of this unusual moviemaking team , pushes Mom and Dad as if it were snake oil . The film is shown only to unmixed audiences after a town has been saturated with a ballyhoo campaign that leaves no one but the livestock unaware of the chance to learn the facts of life . Each of the 16 prints of the film now touring the U.S. has its own advance man , plus a lecturer and two " nurses . " The so-called nurses revive spectators who faint during the bolder medical sequences . During intermission , after the lecturer 's spiel , they help him hawk pamphlets on sex . Sales to date , at $1 each : 7,000,000 . <P> It 's No Sin . The producers decided to try religion when they got hold of a four-hour Cinecolor film of the annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oberammergau by citizens of Lawton , Okla . Babb &; Jossey trimmed the film and added some homey fictional sequences fore &; aft , starring a six-year-old " find " from Atlanta , named Ginger Prince ( " 42 inches and 42 pounds of Southern charm " ) . <P> The Lawton Story will get the same painstaking local promotion as Mom and Dad , and will wear the same trimmings . There will be an intermission for a " world famous lecturer , " hawking another $1 pamphlet- " The Prince of Peace . " Say the picture 's pitchmen : " The film will move the most hardened sinner , comfort the most troubled . " Says untroubled Live Wire Kroger Babb : " It 's no sin to make a profit .
