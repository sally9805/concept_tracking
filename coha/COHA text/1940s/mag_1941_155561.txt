With two months to go before their first year on the air is completed , NBC 's Quiz Kids this week were hard on the heels of NBC 's Information Please . The juniors ' Crossley rating was 11.6 against 11.9 for the senior masterminds . Last week the Quiz Kids did their stuff for the largest audience in radio when they appeared as guests on Jack Benny 's Jell-O show . And Jack Benny once again proved himself the most astute gentleman in radio by tying up with the infant marvels for four combined broadcasts . <P> Unlike regular Quiz Kid shows , their first question-and-answer act with Benny was carefully rehearsed and gags for the program were supplied by Benny 's writers . Rated the drollest Jell-O show this year , the program involved a question bee between the Kids and the Benny cast . Typical question addressed to the Kids : Name the five orders of fishes in order of their development , and give examples of each . Typical question addressed to the cast : If you had 20 apples and your mother took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have ? <P> Neatly rigged to permit Benny &; friends to triumph , the Jell-O quiz was repeated this week . Posing as a nine-year-old wizard on a quiz board composed of William Shakespeare , aged 6 , Isaac Newton , 7 , Lady Godiva , 6 , and Fred Allen , 8 , Benny made a great to-do about coaxing the Quiz Kids into telling him what sort of questions he will be asked when he shows up on their show later . As guest of the Quiz Kids , Benny will be primed on gags but not on questions . <P> Taking Hollywood by storm , the Quiz Kids were entertained with a party at Walt Disney 's studios , kowtowed to by many a star . Special favorite of Benny is eight-year-old Gerard Darrow , who will make another appearance with his chums on the Jell-O show next week . Like all the Quiz Kids , Gerard was slightly miffed to find his autograph in such demand that he had a hard time expanding his own collection .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
