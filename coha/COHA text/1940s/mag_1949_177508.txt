" Now the way to solve this problem , " said the bartender , " would be for the King to abdicate and let his son Baudouin come back and be King . We hear young Baudouin is n't too bright , but who the hell wants a bright King ? Only it looks as if it is n't going to happen because our King is a stubborn , bitter man . " <P> This discourse took place in " Le Pot , " a little cafe down by the canals in Brussels . Stroking his handlebar mustache , the bartender explained how the King became bitter . " There Leopold was-a young , handsome , dashing fellow anxious to make a splash in the world the way the Prince of Wales was doing over in England . What happened ? His father was Albert , le roi chevalier , and his popularity put the boy completely in the shade . Then Leopold got married , and his bride turned out to be Astrid , one of the prettiest princesses you ever saw . She used to wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other mothers and talk diapers and formulas . She got so popular that the prince was in the shade again .

She was once known as &qout; The Shrimp Queen , " because her father had made a lot of money in shrimp . In Northern villages , alongside pictures of Leopold inscribed " We await our King 's return , " there were on display posters of bosomy Mary Liliane in a low-cut evening dress , bending over a banquet table strewn with blossoms . The caption said simply : " Fruits and Flowers . " <P> Tea &; Poison . Day after day the Socialist Le Peuple lit into Leopold . The paper recalled that in November 1940 , while a " captive " in his castle , Leopold had run down to Berchtesgaden for tea with Hitler .
