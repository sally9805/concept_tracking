txt Pay-Go Tax for Corporations I hope the tax experts of the Treasury are concentrating on some sort of pay-as-you-go tax for corporations in 1944 . If the individual tax is to bring in an additional five billion for 1943 , as now estimated , think for a moment of the billions to be gained by a similar corporation and excess-profits tax . There is one tremendously important reason for making the change immediately . Thousands of new wartime corporations have sprung up recently . They have had a mushroom growth and are swollen with war profits . What will be their financial condition the year alter the war ends ? No one can tell , but any careful business man col- lects his risky accounts while his debtor is solvent . The Treasury may quite possibly lose a billion dollars from these unhealthy corporations unless it collects the tax during the year it is earned . GEORGE MAXWELL CLARK . Brooklyn , Aug. 7 , 1943.
