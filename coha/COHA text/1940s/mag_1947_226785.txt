The war was over for Poland 's ludzie lesni ( forest people ) . Last week hundreds of men and boys , singly and in straggling groups , came out of the woods , trudged to the nearest police station and surrendered their arms and themselves . Many had been underground since Poland 's defeat in 1939 . They had fought the Germans , the Russians and the postwar Polish Government they hated . <P> Now , many of them said , there was no point in fighting on against the Communist-dominated Government , which offered them amnesty during an eleven-week surrender period . It also offered them a priority rating for jobs and a little cash ( about $5 ) to get started on . <P> In a Warsaw police station a veteran WIN ( Liberty and Independence ) fighter spoke what was in the minds of many . " There 's nothing more we can do , " said he . " I do n't understand why the Americans insist on hoarding their atom bombs , instead of putting them to use . When they decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight again . Meanwhile , it 's time to go back to work . I 'm tired and I want to live with my wife , work in the daytime and sleep nights . " <P> By this week the underground in Poland was almost entirely dissolved .
