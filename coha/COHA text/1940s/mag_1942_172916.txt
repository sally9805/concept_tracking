Mathematics , the schoolboy 's horror , is perking up again after a long sabbatical in the educational doghouse . During the ' 30s the proportion of high-school pupils taking math dropped a third in six years , and many an educator dismissed algebra , to the vast relief of pupils , as a useless subject . But last week there were signs aplenty that U.S. schools were returning to the view that there is much to be said for the third R. <P> &gt; Private-school headmasters learned that too many boys knew too little math to qualify as officer material for the Army and Navy , decided to teach them more of it . <P> &gt; New York City published a revolutionary new course of study for its huge public-school system , dedicated to the proposition that mathematics , as taught in school , should have more to do with the price of eggs . So doing , New York followed the example of public schools in Los Angeles , St. Louis , Detroit , Providence , Rochester , many another city . <P> &gt;Many colleges are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together quickly all the branches of math . <P> &gt; Even in Progressive schools teachers have found that math can not be properly taught as an incident in storekeeping , needs to be studied in its own right . <P> Mathematicians have long been haunted by a paradox : although most U.S. citizens profess to dread the study of mathematics , they are suckers for mathematical puzzles , made a best-seller of Lancelot Hogben 's Mathematics for the Million . The mathematicians ' conclusion : the trouble is not with mathematics but with the way it is taught . Most math teachers emphasize computation to the point of drudgery . A prime example ( from an old U.S. arithmetic textbook - Greenleaf ' s ) : " Required the contents of the earth , supposing its circumference to be 25,000 miles . Ans. 263,858,149,120.06886875 cubic miles . " <P> Such exercises are worse than useless , many modern teachers believe , because 1 ) in real life most computations involve numbers under 100 , 2 ) pupils can spend their time more profitably checking simpler computations , learning how to trace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn the principle of " approximation " : i.e. , that perfect accuracy in any measurement is an unattainable ideal . Heaviest charge modern teachers lay against traditional math teaching is that its artificial exercises fail to teach pupils how to solve practical problems . <P> New York City 's new math course , ten years a-making , is for junior high school pupils , will eventually be extended to higher grades . Some of its innovations : <P> &gt; Study of arithmetic , algebra and geometry is combined , relations between them explained . <P> &gt; Pupils get less computation , more problem-solving . <P> &gt; Lessons are based on such practical problems as meter reading , map reading , timetable reading , floorplan drawing , computing the cost of a trip , profit &; loss , interest , taxes , budgets , insurance . <P> &gt; Decimal fractions get more attention than common ones . <P> &gt; Pupils are taught the functions of banks , the dangers of reckless speculation . <P> &gt; All this requires sweeping revision of the famed old standard textbooks ( e.g. , Robinson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schultze &; Sevenoak 's Plane and Solid Geometry ) .
