txt WASHINGTON , May ** lawyers who read today a decision in the Federal district court here on the rights of Congress to seek information it considers pertinent to any of its activities believe that , if tested , the decision will be upheld in the Supreme Court . This prospect suggests that one of these days there , may be wholesale burning of documents which public men heretofore have considered private property  --  diaries , letters and the like . . The decision was written by Justice Holtzoff , and its immediate effect was to sustain the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities . The committee had denied motions to dismiss contemptof-Congress indictments which it had caused to be brought against twenty persons . These were members of organizations described by the committee as " pro-communist " who either had not appeared , before it with requested records or had failed to answer questions . The court held that the committee was within its right in asking for the information and the documents . But , in stating the law , the court made certain observations which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any citizen that Congress may deem to have any bearing at all on legislation , past or projected , is beyond the power of Congress to demand and to receive . This construction would , of course , if Congress so desired , open to Congressional inspection many of the documents at Hyde Park which the late President Roosevelt ordered impounded permanently or for a given number of years . The only papers which may be beyond the jurisdiction of Congress , as these lawyers see it , are collections received in trust by the government itself , to be opened after a reasonable period . Such a collection is the Lincoln papers , entrusted to the Library of Congress for publication in July . The sections of the decision on which this construction is based are as f ollows : If the subject matter under scrutiny may have any possible relevancy and materiality , no matter how remote , to some possible legislation , it is within the power of Congress to investigate the matter . No one who has any conception of the meaning of democracy would tolerate any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , may not presume in advance that the Congress will transgress the Constitution . It would be intolerable if the judiciary were to intrude into the activities of the legislative branch of the government and virtually stop the progress of an investigation which is intended to secure information the Congress deems necessary . One of the lawyers who made the broad interpretation of these judicial words added this comment : " I would now almost guarantee to a client the failure of his attempt to keep papers dealing with public matters out of the hands of any committee of Congress that wants to see them , provided the committee had the full authority and backing of the House or the Senate . It would be a pretty poor lawyer for a committee who could not cite ' possible relevancy and materiality , no matter how remote , ' between the committee 's legislative purpose and the so-called private papers it wanted to see . And I do not doubt that Justice Holtzoff stated the law accurately . " If this viewpoint becomes accepted without further legal action , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Supreme Court , the effect on official diarists and others in the United States , and on the letters they mark " personal and private , " should be strongly costive . Congress , of course , might reject efforts of its committees to take advantage of these stated powers and abolish for certaint citizens all the private rights granted to them by the Constitution . Or , in instances of flagrant abuses , which Congress was willing to tolerate in a committee , the high courts might step in to protect reasonable privacy . But documents easily demonstrable to be pertinent to legislation , such as surely exist in the restricted files at Hyde Park and in the Morgenthau diaries , could hardly be withheld from Congress by the wish of their owners , testamentary or otherwise , in consonance with Justice Holtzoff 's decision . The habit among officials and lookers-on of keeping diaries , or writing their accounts of great events in personal letters to families and friends , is very old . Under the New Deal it expanded under several stimuli . But the most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unusual number of New Dealers and other persons . brought to Washington in the Roosevelt era , ( 2 ) the intrusion of the dramatic element of war , and ( 3 ) the lavish prices which publishers in recent years began to pay for " inside " official revelations . From the White House down through the lower levels of government this kind of writing became a large industry . And of this kind of writing diaries and notes " made on the scene " are indispensable for the appearance of accuracy ? ex parte though they be . There was almost a test made during the Pearl Harbor inquiry of the rights of Congress to examine a private diary ? that of Joseph C. Grew . But he explained that he withheld it , not to defy Congress , but to protect neutral diplomatic colleagues in Tokyo who , after he was shut off from channels of information , kept him informed and permitted him to transmit their reports to Washington . Congress excused him , but it did not waive its right to subpoena the diary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
