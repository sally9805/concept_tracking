One night last week , under a bright quarter moon , Manhattan music fans gathered for the season 's first outdoor concert at Lewisohn Stadium . A stocky , apple-cheeked woman , violin in hand , marched to the center of the stage , nodded confidently to the conductor . <P> She had a little trouble at first : besides the roar of planes and auto traffic that plagues all stadium concerts , she got too close to the mike , which turned her tone into a shrill whine . But midway through Tchaikovsky 's Concerto in D , audience and critics alike knew they were listening to as powerful and fiery fiddling as they had heard all season . They let famed Violinist Erica Morini know it . <P> In the past , most critics have reached into the most convenient pigeonhole to describe Erica Morini : " The greatest woman violinist . . . " Others could excuse her sex but not forget it : " A great violinist-regardless of sex . " But now , after 20 years of hearing her play , most were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fiddler . <P> Single Minds . Erica Morini by now is used to the pigeonhole , but not resigned to it . One of the first times she played in public , for Austria 's Emperor Karl , the Emperor was agreeably surprised-not because she was a girl , but because she was only eight . He gave her a doll . The first time she was tagged as a " woman violinist , " she says , was in the U.S. Now , at 40 , Erica says , " I hate that label . It 's obvious I 'm a woman , but what does that have to do with it ? " She is well aware that few women have made their mark in the arts , and that they are mostly singers ( Schumann-Heink ) , dancers ( Pavlova ) or novelists ( Jane Austen , the Bronts , George Eliot ) . There have been women composers like Ccile Chaminade , but no Bachs or Beethovens ; painters like Mary Cassatt and Georgia O'Keeffe , but no Rembrandts or Michelangelos ; poets like Sappho and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top women pianists* and virtually no memorable violinists . <P> But says Erica , " It 's not a matter of talent , not at all . There are just as many women born with great talents for music as men . But most women have n't the singleminded drive and determination it takes to be a great artist . They 're interested in too many other things . They wo n't make the sacrifice . " <P> False Notes . Erica is interested in other things too : her jeweler-husband , her cooking . But ever since she used to hide in her father 's classroom in Vienna as a tot of three and cry " false " when a student struck a sour note , music has always come first . Now a confirmed classicist , she says that contemporary music " is not music for me-I like to play a tune . " <P> Erica has no children of her own , but likes to play for kids when she can . She cherishes the reaction of a six-year-old who told her after a concert : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> <P> *One of them : Robert Schumann 's wife Clara Weick , who could hold her own against such competition as Franz Liszt's.
