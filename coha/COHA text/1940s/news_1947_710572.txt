txt The Senate failed by two votes to roll up a veto-proof majority today in passing the second personal income tax reduction bill , 60 to 32 . Opponents said that the ballot made it virtually certain that the Republicans would again fail to enact such a measure over the President 's objections . The first bill , which was to have become effective July 1 , was killed June 17 when the House sustained Mr. Truman 's veto by a two-vote margin . Sufficient strength to override his promised veto of the second bill is apparently assured in the House , which passed it by twenty-five votes more than a two-third majority . On . the basis of today 's test , however , it would be killed in the Senate . Vote Switches Held Unlikely The Senate vote on the new bill , which is identical to the vetoed measure except for a change of the effective date to next Jan. 1 , was regarded in many Capitol quarters as an accurate forecast of how the Senate will vote when the President sends it back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention to veto it , and accordingly no conceivable grounds for any future switches could be seen with the issue so finely drawn . Republican leaders , however , would not concede defeat , and Senator Eugene D. Millikin of Colorado , floor manager of the bill , said : " It 's not sunk yet . We have a fighting chance . There may be some switches . " " I never give up , " Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio said . " I was n't particularly surprised at the vote , but we may override yet . Anything is possible . " " Sews It Up , " Barkley Says Senator Alben W. Barkley of Kentucky , minority leader , disagreed , saying that there was not a chance the veto could be overridden , since this vote " sews it up . " With one Senator on each side absent today but expected to be present when the chamber acts on the veto , the indicated final tally would be 61 to 33. still two short of an overriding majority . The absentees were Senators Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for the bill , and Elbert D. Thomas . Democrat , of Utah . who is against it . Senator Tobey is in New , Hampshire with his wife , who is ill . Senator Thomas returned to this country today from an international conference . A third absentee , Senator Robert F. Wagner , Democrat , of New York , is ill and is not expected to be present to vote on the veto . The ininety-sixth Senator Theodore G. I Bilbo , Democrat , of Mississippi , has not been sworn . The roll call on passage today showed the following division : For the bill , forty-eight Republicans and twelve Democrats . Against it , thirty Democrats and two Republicans , who were Senators Wayne IL . Morse of Oregon and William Langer of North Dakota . 4 Democrats Change Vote Of the Democrats supporting the measure , four had voted against the first bill . They were Senators Harry F. Byrd of Virginia , Edwin C. Johnson of Colorado , A. Willis Robertson of Virginia and Millard E. Tydings of Maryland . The only other shift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kentucky , who had opposed the previous bill . A technicality barring Speaker Joseph W. Martin Jr . from signing it while the House was in ad , ournment prevented the measure // from being sent to the White House until tomorrow . Consequently , President Truman Will have until midnight July 26 to act and could , if he wished , disrupt plans for adjournment of Congress on that date by holding it for the full period . Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg , Republican , of Michigan , told the Senate , however , that Mr. Truman had assured him that he would act promptly , and leaders looked for the veto message in two or three days . The House plans to act immediately , and Senators Taft and Millikin said that . the Senate would take the vote to override late this week or early next week . The bill goes to the White House in precisely the same form that Representative Harold Knutson , Republican , of Minnesota , introduced it on June 24 . It calls for cuts ranging from 30 per cent for persons with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incomes above $302,000 and a $500 increase in personal exemptions for those over sixty-five years of age . Amendments Are Defeated The Senate rapidly rejected a series of amendments soon before passage . A proposal by Senator John L. McClellan , Democrat , of Arkansas , to extend to all states the tax advantages of thirteen states having laws permitting : harried couples to divide their incomes for tax purposes was turned down by a vote of 52 to 40 . An amendment by Senator Harley M. Kilgore , Democrat , of West Virginia , to substitute the McClellan proposal for the entire pending bill was defeated by a voice vote . The second of three amendments by Senator McClellan was rejected , 61 to 25 . It called for recognition by the Federal Government for tax purposes of family partnership arrangements that are legal under state law . Mr. McClellan 's third amendment , to increase personal exemptions and dependency allowances by $100 , was turned down , 47-43 , with ten Republicans voting for it . An amendment by Senator Glen H. Taylor , Democrat , of Idaho , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for homes by veterans and others , lost by a voice vote . Senator McClellan , who offered his community property amendment with twenty-three co-sponsors , led the hardest fight that developed during Senate consideration of the bill . His tactics resulted in an unusual Saturday night session . Saying that the fight was not lost , he served notice today that he would bring up the issue " again and again " until Congress sustained him . Republican leaders in the House and Senate have promised that the inequity would be ended under a general tax revision bill that is being prepared for passage early next year .
