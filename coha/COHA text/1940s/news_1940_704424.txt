txt General trend of prices is still upward even though " no serious increase " has taken place since the start of the European war , according to the latest study by the Temporary National Economic Committee , released last night . As exceptions , the study noted , there have been extensive rises in the prices of certain imports and of domestic products that have a direct war use .
