txt Fish experiments here have shown that atomic rays carry damage or death beyoad , he first generation of descendants . " Translated into terms of human beings , " said Dr. Lauren R. Donaldson , director of the applied fisheries laboratory at the University of Washington , " the re ? search thus far indicates that the grandchildren of Nagasaki and Hiroshima survivors will be less fertile than normal parents and will produce more stillborn or misshapen offspring if they have any families at all . Speed.Up Generations Dr. Donaldson . who has led the study of the effects of the Bikini atom bombs on marine life , is in Charge of the radiation research at the fisheries laboratory . The laboratory is the co-ordinating center for almost all federally supported research on effects of rays on marine life . A special strain of " supertrout " have been used in the heredity studies . Under special cultivation , they attain maturity in half the normal time , thereby doubling the speed of generations . In the experiments , seven groups of the fish were bombarded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar to the gamma rays from atomic explosions . Survival Rate Drops A fourth generation is currently being spawned . Dr. Donaldson said the studies of the three generations have shown that the larger the dosage of radiation received by the first generation , the more descendants will die or develop abnormalities . " In succeeding generations , " he reported , " the rate of survival is lower and the incidence of abnormalities increases , even among the descendants of trout that received only small doses . " He said large numbers of eggs with irradiated ancestors are infertile . in others the embryo dies during the incubation period or soon after hatching . Among those that . hatched , a large percentage had defects .
