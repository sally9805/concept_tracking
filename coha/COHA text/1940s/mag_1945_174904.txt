Doctors could do nothing with a brooding G.I. mental patient in Washington 's St. Elizabeth 's Hospital , until one of them noted on his medical records that he had once been a flutist in a symphony orchestra . They sent for a music teacher and a flute . <P> The soldier ignored the teacher , but took the flute off by himself . Soon he was playing it , and taking lessons daily . As the memory of music came , his despondency went . Last week he was discharged , a mentally healthy veteran . <P> The flute and the teacher ( Mrs. Vitya Vronsky of the piano-team of Vronsky and Babin ) were sent to the hospital by Washington 's Music Canteen , an enterprise to make G.I.s their own entertainers . <P> Every weekend hundreds of soldiers and sailors , WAVES and WACs report to the Canteen for free music lessons and instruments to rehearse on . In a year , 45 volunteer teachers have given more than 3,000 lessons , and some 12,000 servicemen have practiced in the Canteen atop the Homer L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donates the space , and keeps the 100-odd available instruments in repair . ) <P> The Canteen 's noisy weekends are coolly run by matronly Mrs. Harry Lee Virden , an Episcopal Army chaplain 's wife , who assigns classic-minded musicians to practice rooms on the second floor , and jam fans to the third floor . The resultant uproar from the 28 unsoundproofed cubbyholes usually involves the trial flights of several singers , a dozen pianists , a hot accordion , strings and horns , all at once . One soldier motorcycles up from Ft . Belvoir ( Va. ) for violin lessons from Author Catherine Drinker Bowen ( Yankee from Olympus ) . <P> Because it has a waiting list of 30 servicemen , the Canteen has a rigid rule : anybody who misses two lessons is dropped . Last week a sailor who had been absent twice and a soldier who had missed three lessons asked for , and got , reinstatement . Their excuse for being away : they had been to Potsdam .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
