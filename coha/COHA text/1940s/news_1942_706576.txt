txt Fact Coast civilians will be lucky if they get any gasoline at all for non-essential uses after September . That is the view of the leaders in the oil industry who are waging a continuous struggle to increase the flow of oil and gasoline to the East  --  by barges , pipeline , rail , and what tankers a re available . Foremost problem is that rationing has n't worked as the industry and the Office of Price Administration hoped it would . It is estimated by oil people that demand for gasoline in the East last month was only 10% less than a year ago : rationing called for a 50% decline . Industry leaders have their fingers crossed on the outlook for the permanent rationing program which starts July 22 . By fall the difficulties wil l be doubled as the industry attempts to bring adequate fuel oil to heat the many factories , office buildings , houses and apartment buildings that depend on this fuel . This is in addition to the supply of heavy fuel oil it must maintain to keep the wheels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , oline There will come a choice between fuel oil and gasoline . It appears that fuel oil must win . In view of these facts the industry does n't agree with the optimistic report on prospects for East Coast oil supplies issued Wednesday by the Senate Commerce Committee . That report was based on the findings of .1 Ft . Parten . Director of Transportation in the Office of Petroleum Coordinator . ( Yesterday Federal Petroleum Coordina-. for Ickes said that apparently there had been a misunderstanding of the Parten report . He stated that he was " apprehensive that the misunderstanding will make people unduly optimistic when there is no warrant for it . " Story on Page 3 . That Senate Committee report envisioned deliveries of 1,429,000 barrels of all oil products by the year-end " if " certain pipe line construction an ? relocation were undertaken , and also " if " 200,000 barrels a day were brought in by tanker .

It has special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would indicate that more tankers will be required to supply needs of the military and tankers are not expected to be available for civilian oil movements . The question of convoy protection is involved , too . In its calculations the industry rules out tankers , and in so doing , is in accord with the opinions expressed by the Federal Petroleum Coordinator and other government officials . Essential needs of oil on the Atlantic Seaboard for the last three months of thus year sue estimated at 1.375,000 barrels daily . They compare with normal . unrationed demand of an estimated 1,730.000 barrels a day . Against essential needs , deliveries in midJune by all methods of transportation approximated only 954,000 barrels a day , or 425,000 less . Assuming that all the pipe-line and barge projects listed by Mr. Parten are completed this year  --  although there is some opinion that they can not be fully met  --  and eliminating the 200.000 barrels a day by tankers , It is evident that approximately 1,229.000 barrels a day may be delivered late this year .

In June , for instance , demand for gasoline , on industry estimates , approximated 550,000 barrels a day It was about a 10% reduction against 50% ordered in deliveries to service stations by major companies in accordance with an order of the Office of Price Administration . Under that order the demand should have been about 315,000 barrels a day The higher demand , it is explained , was the result of failure to restrict deliveries to jobbers and no limit on big consumers who are buying directly in the interior . The condition has resulted in the full utilization of all gasoline brought in by the oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut into the small stocks in the area . If the situation should continue , some executives believe that there will be little , if any , gasoline available for civilians by late September . Tighter Control Over Rationing One remedy , pit is suggested , is tighter control over the permanent form of rationing which should eliminate many of the intermediate classifications which allowed larger quantities of gasoline . In order to meet the unwarranted demand for gasoline the East Coast companies have been forced to move.that fuel with the result that additions to heating ( fuel ) oil stocks have not been substantial and a shortage looms this winter . Another aspect of the heating oil situation revolves around price . Interior refiners contend that ceiling prices set by the Government do not justify their processing more of this grade of oil to the detriment of gasoline , the profit product . If the C.P.A. sanctions a higher price , on the other hand , it would have to be translated into corresponding advances in the East .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
