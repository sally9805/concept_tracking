txt Congressional fears that the Roosevelt administration is planning to send an expeditionary force to Europe , Africa , or Asia were increased today by further details in the report of Gen. George C. Marshall , army chief of staff , requesting authority to retain draftees , National Guardsmen , and reservists in service indefinitely and send them to fight anywhere in the world . Gen. Marshall revealed in an appendix to the formal report he submitted yesterday to Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson that the regular army 's 1st and 3d divisions , which have been supplied with more modern weapons than other units , have been trained with the navy and marines In landing operations such ns would be required of an expeditionary force . isutme rressure from Above .

" This phraseology strongly resembled that of Secretary Stimson when he told a senate investigating committee on April 15 that " our forces must be prepared for the possibilities of war in many and varied terrains , it being quite uncertain in what part of North or South America , or even possibly other regions , it ultimately may be necessary to use them in the defense of this country and its possessions . " Reverses Former Stand . Opponents of the Marshal : proposals , which would permit creation of a force of from 2 million to 3 million men , recalled that only a year ago the chief of staff strongly opposed increasing the strength of the regular army to 750,000 men . They recalled also that in Februarj ; , 1940 , before Stimson became secretary of war , Gen. Marshall expressed the view of the war department that a regular army of 242,000 men , together with the National Guard , then numbering about 235,000 , could de . fend the United States and its commitments in the western hemisphere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for authority to retain National Guardsmen , draftees , and reservists in service for more than a year would permit increasing the strength of the army to 2,348,500 officers and men .

Testimony Last Year . On Feb. 23. 1940 , testifying before the ' house military appropriations subcommittee on the war department appropriations bill for the fiscal year 1941 , Gen. Marshall set forth the missions of the United States army , as then conceived by the war depart . nient . He said : " After providing for the overseas garrisons of 70,000 soldiers engaged in protecting , naval . Installations , we should maintain in this country a force strong enough to meet our continental requirements , strong enough to meet possible raids , strong enough to control on short notice any threat to the Panama canal , and sufficient to serve as a base for the development of a war army . " To provide for the missions referred to . the department is of the opinion that there should be a further increase of 15,000 men . . . . To do this would involve a yearlyrecurring charge of approximately $19,000,000 . It would carry the regular establishment to 242,000 men , the minimum of seasoned soldiers we think should be maintained by this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a period of prolonged peace . " Opposed to Conscription . A sew weeks later , In testimony before the house military affairs committee , Gen. Marshall said th e strength of the regular army need not be more than 400,000 men to meet the requirements of national defense . He expressed opposition to conscription and said there would be no occasion for it if congress would give the war department authority to mobilize the National Guard for a year 's training . The committee recommended increasing the authorized strength of the regular army from 280,000 to 375,000 men , which congress did . On July 12 , 1940 , Gen. Marshall appeared before the senate military affairs committee , which was considering the administration 's conscrip- ' tion bill . The strength of the regular army at that time , he said , was about 255,000 men . " And you would like to build that 255,000 up to what ? " asked Senator Lister Hill D. , Ala . . Suggests ? 375,000 . " A peace strength of 375,000 , " replied Gen. Marshall , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is 355,000 , and we will build it up to that as rapidly , as possible . That embraces all the ground forces . The remaining 40,000 to go to 375,000 is for the air corps , to handle the equipment that is to be delivered at some later date . " Gen. Marshall said he could get the 335,000 under the voluntary enlistment system , but it might take too long . In his report yesterday he said the army 's present strength of 1,448,500 included 476,000 three year volunteers . Aitho he repeatedly mentionel 335 , - 000 as the desired objective of the war department , Gen. Marshall told the Military Affairs committee that Under the conscription program the Units of the regular army would be increased to full war strength , which would make a total ' of 500,000 men . The conscription program would require an increase in the National Guard units from a total of 220,000 mobilization strength to 400,000 , he said . Opposes Large Expansion . " I might inject here a comment regarding proposals that have been made to increase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If that were done , two things would happen . We would have either to organize units from the ground up without any trained personnel to leaven the mass , which would require about a year , or we would have to emasculate existing units in the regular army in order to provide nuclei for new units . " I do not think that we should take such a hazard as that at the present time . Another and still more Serious effect would be that we wouldl have to emasculate the National Guard - in order to find the necessary ' equipment for the new units , This would mean a complete alteration of the present national defense .
