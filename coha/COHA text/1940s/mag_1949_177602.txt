Frankie Frisch , 51 , baseball 's old " Fordham Flash , " is an ingenious man and a highly vocal competitor . Once , while managing Pittsburgh , he tried to get himself thrown out of a hopelessly lost ball game in Brooklyn so that he could hustle up to New Rochelle , N.Y . and tend his flower garden . " No you do n't , Frisch , " said the umpire he was sassing . " Get back on the bench and go home with the rest of us . " When Frisch was running the celebrated Gashouse Gang in St. Louis , Dizzy Dean used to needle him " just to hear that Dutchman roar . " Last week , the Dutchman got a new job that would tax his ingenuity and vocal cords . <P> Frisch resigned as coach for the New York Giants ( where he had won fame in the ' 20s as a hard-hitting , base-stealing second baseman ) to become manager of the tottering Chicago Cubs . He replaced another Dutchman , Charlie Grimm , who was nudged upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wartime pennant under Grimm , the Cubs had become tame as kittens . They finished in the National League cellar last year for the first time in 23 years and were still struggling to stay out of last place last week . That Frisch could lift them out of the doldrums this season was something fans on Chicago 's North Side hoped for but hardly expected . But at least there would be more noise around Wrigley Field .
