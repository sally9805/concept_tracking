It is the Rh factor in human blood , discovered in 1940 and so named because famed Blood Analysts Karl Landsteiner and Alexander Solomon Wiener used rhesus monkeys in their early experiments . Exactly what the factor is , doctors still do not know , but they have devised tests to determine who is Rh-positive and who is Rh-negative , and have found that the Rh factor sometimes complicates blood transfusion . Last week Dr. Enrique Eduardo Ecker of Cleveland 's Western Reserve University advocated premarital tests for the factor .
