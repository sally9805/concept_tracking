Luxemburg 's plump , commonsensical Premier Pierre Dupong made a sensible remark about the Berlin crisis last week . Said he : " I do n't want to find out if the Russians are willing to go to war . I would like to know , but I do n't want to find out . " <P> As both sides entered what was bound to become a new phase of East-West relations in Europe , the crisis crystallized the strengths and weaknesses of both . The Yalta-Potsdam comedy was played out . With or without another top-level conference between Russia and the Western powers , the old agreements , long since dishonored by the Communists , would be replaced by a more realistic pattern . What that pattern would be depended on how much strength , cooperation and purpose the Western nations could generate in the next few months . <P> That the West would have a few months in which to pull up its political socks became probable last week when General Lucius Clay declared that the Berlin Airlift could be expanded and continued indefinitely ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply the lessons it had learned from the Berlin crisis , the West would come to a conference with the Russians with little reason to fear a setback . <P> Any readjustment of Western policy would have to start with a clear understanding of what Russia was now trying to do in Europe . The Kremlin had two main objectives : 1 ) to wipe out or reduce U.S. power on the Continent , and 2 ) to stop Western Union . On objective No. 1 the Russians ' Berlin crisis had backfired . By committing itself to the relief of Berlin the U.S. had committed itself more deeply than ever to the defense of Europe . The very vulnerability of the U.S. military position in Berlin taught the lesson of how necessary it was to have force on the spot . On their objective No. 2 , however , the Russians had made some headway with the Berlin blockade . <P> When the Western Union nations met last week at The Hague ( see below ) , they were frightened , divided and frustrated . Talk of impending war reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be turned into an asset by the anti-Communist nations if it gave to Western Union a sense of urgency , if it could be quickly translated into a real political , military and economic program for a Western Union which would be far stronger than the sum of its parts . <P> Suppose , for example , that tomorrow the U.S. , Britain and France should sit down with Russia to talk about the German problem . The U.S. would insist ( rightly ) that Germany must be rehabilitated for the sake of Europe . The Russians would promptly try to divide the West by playing on the French ( and others ' ) fear of a strong Germany . With Western Union in its present inert state , the Russians would probably succeed in this maneuver . <P> But next fall the Big Four might sit down under quite different circumstances . By then there might be a move toward a U.S. military guarantee of Western Union , starting with practical staff cooperation in an Atlantic defense system . Western Union might be moving rapidly on the political and economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a weak and divided Western Europe must insist on a helpless Germany , and until Gerrnany recovers Western Europe can not recover . A strong Western Europe can face ( and include ) a revived Germany . The first alternative means a Russian victory in the next phase of East-West relations ; the second means a Western victory .
