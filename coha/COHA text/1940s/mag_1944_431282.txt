 | REVOLUTION IN RICE Condensed from The Washington Post ? By George Kent IN A shabby warehouse in Houston , Texas , two practical men are working out an idea which may bring improved health and vigor to a large part of the world 's population . They arc producing a white rice that is a complete food ; one that retains up to 8o percent of the vitamins and minerals of the field-ripe cereal . They call it converted rice . Creamy in color , it cooks up into a snowy whiteness . Ordinary rice is stripped of a large portion of its nutrients by the process of manufacturing , and reaches the buyer as almost pure carbohydrates . People who eat it unmixed with other vegetables or with meat suffer a chronic weariness , and are subject to beriberi and pellagra . The new rice prevents such deficiency diseases . Half of the earth 's 2 , ooo , ooo , ooo inhabitants live chiefly on rice . To them the improved cereal would mean , when the war is over , vastly better health and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolution in rice are Gordon Harwell Ind Eric Huzenlaub . Their Houston plant is producing about 2oo,0oo pounds of converted rice daily ? all ) f it for the Army . In a few months a new mill will double that output . Four other mills under different management will soon go to work in Arkansas , Louisiana and Texas . Formerly a produce broker in Houston , a big rice town , Harwell was aroused by what he read of the lack of nutrition in white rice . He had a hunch that somehow he could preserve the natural benefits in rice by a special cooking process . He began boiling batches of rice in a pressure cooker . When finally he got on what seemed to be the right track , he heard of the work of Huzenlaub , an English food chemist who had been laboring for ten years with the same objective and had worked out the necessary industrial process . So Harwell wrote a letter to England . Huzenlaub was a discouraged man when the letter arrived . It had been his scheme to set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war had intervened . Harwell 's letter made little impression on him . What did America 's six pounds per capita a year amount to , compared with India 's 35o pounds ! Harwell wrote 2o letters ; he cabled and telephoned . In the end the Britisher did come to the United States , but not primarily to see Harwell . He spent weeks visiting the big rice millers . No one was interested in his process . Disappointed , he started for home . Harwell was at the airport to see him off . Then occurred one of those minor accidents which so often affect men 's lives : Huzenlaub slipped and dislocated his shoulder . He was  | taken to the hospital . Before the Britisher left his bed , a week later , Harwell and he had made a deal . This was toward the end of 1942 . I larwell induced the War Production Board to dole out a few priorities . In a Dallas junkyard he found a pressure tank ; in Galveston , a boiler . He took his savings out of the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leased an old warehouse , installed machinery and began producing converted rice . When I visited the plant in Houston recently I saw scores of workmen loading freight cars with the new rice . And in their tiny office Gordon Harwell and Eric Huzenlaub were working on plans for further expansion . To understand this revolution in rice , one must know a little about milling methods . Rough rice or " paddy " has a fairly loose outer husk and three tighter inner skins . These four layers contain the various factors of the Vitamin-B complex as well as minerals . Millers , in response to a popular liking for food that is white , rub away all four coats , leaving a pearly grain consisting mostly of starch . As a final step , the grain is coated with talc and glucose to give it luster . When the rice reaches the kitchen , the housewife tosses it into a colander and lets the water run over it , thus removing the talc and also any vestige of Vitamin B that may have remained . In the Huzenlaub process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacuum tank where the air is sucked out of the grain . Hot water at extremely high pressure is forced into the emptiness thus created . The B vitamins , being soluble in water , are pushed into the center of the grain . Steam is applied to seal them there . When the rice is dry , milling machines remove the husk and skins , leaving tough , cream-colored kernels whose nutrients can not be rinsed away . Converted rice , as shown by exhaustive Army tests , will keep without deterioration for years in all kinds of weather . Weevils , which cost millers millions annually , can not get at these hard , glassy kernels . At the end of 2o to 3o minutes of cooking , the kernels emerge with a pleasing separateness ? and will remain that way after a night in the refrigerator . Dr. M. C. Kik , rice chemist for the University of Arkansas , attested in the Rice journal that the Vitamin B content of converted rice was twice to three times that of polished white rice . Colonel Rohland A. Isker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new rice one of the most significant scientific developments of World War II . Dr. R. R. Williams , of the National Research Council , finds that rice conversion b " the most feasible process for the improvement of the nutritional value of rice , " and expressed the opinion that the process might very well revolutionize milling methods throughout the world . The sponsors believe that the conversion method can be applied to virtually all cereals . With it , Huzenlaub has produced a full-vitamin wheat , and has experimented with barley and hominy grits . The last is important , for the lack of vitamins in grits results in most of the deficiency ailments among the poor of the  | southern states . Another feature of the process is that vitamins and minerals not present in natural rice , wheat or other grain can be injected into these foods . Rice has been eaten for almost 5ooo years without any substantial improvement except in varieties that produce heavily . Converted rice may well create a new vitality in riceconsuming peoples of the Far East and the Americas which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
