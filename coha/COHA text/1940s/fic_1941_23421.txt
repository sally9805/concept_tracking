BUTCHER BIRD A STORY BY WALLACE STEGNER IMHAT summer the boy was alone on I the farm except for his parents . His brother was working at Orullian 's Grocery in town , and there was no one to run the trap line with or swim with in the dark , weed-smelling reservoir where garter snakes made straight rapid lines in the water and the skaters rowed close to shore . So every excursion was an adventure , even if it was only a trip across the three miles of prairie to Larsen 's to get mail or groceries . He was excited at the visit to Garfield 's as he was excited by everything unusual . The hot midsummer afternoon was still and breathless , the air harder to breathe than usual . He knew there was a change in weather coming because the gingersnaps in their tall cardboard box were soft and bendable when he snitched two to stick in his pocket . He could tell too by his father 's grumpiness accumulated through two weeks of drought , his habit of looking off into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , that something was brewing . If it was rain everything would be fine , his father would hum under his breath getting breakfast , maybe let him drive the stone-boat or ride the mare down to Larsen 's for mail . If it was hot wind they 'd have to walk soft and speak softer , and it would n't be any fun . They did n't know the Garliclds , who had moved in only the fall before ; but people said they had a good big house and a bigger barn and that Mr. Garfieldwas an Englishman and a little funny talking about scientific farming and making the desert blossom like the rose . The boy 's father had n't wanted to go , but his mother thought it was unneighborly not to call at least once in a whole year when people lived only four miles away . She was , the boy knew , as anxious for a change , as eager to get out of that atmosphere of waiting to see what the weather would do that tense and teeth-gritting expectancy  --  as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garfield 's . Mr. Garfield was tail and bald with a big nose , and talked very softly and politely . The boy 's father was determined not to like him right from the start . When Mr. Garfield said , " Dear , I think we might have a glass of lemonade , don ' f you ? " , the boy saw his parents look at each other , saw the beginning of a contemptuous smile on his father 's face , saw his mother purse her lips and shake her head ever so little . And when Mrs. Garfield , prim and spectacled , with a habit of tucking her head back and to one side while she listened to anyone talk , brought in the lemonade , the boy saw his father taste his and make a little face behind the glass . He hated any summer drink without ice in it , and had spent two whole weeks digging a dugout icehouse just so that he could have ice water and cold beer when the hot weather came . But Mr. and Mrs. Garfield were nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed the boy 's mother the rug and the gramophone . When the boy came up curiously to inspect the little box with the petunia-shaped horn and the little china dog with " His Master 's Voice " on it , and the Garfields found that he had never seen or heard a gramophone , they put on a cylinder like a big spool of tightly wound black thread and lowered a needle on it , and out came a man 's voice singing in Scotch brogue , and his mother smiled and nodded and said , " My land , Harry Lauder ! I heard him once a long time ago . Is n't it wonderful , Sonny ? " It was wonderful all right . He inspected it , reached out his fingers to touch things , wiggled the big horn to see if it was loose or screwed in . His father warned him sharply to keep his hands off , but then Mr. Garfield smiled and said , " Oh , he ca n't hurt it . Let 's play something else , " and found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had them all laughing . They let him wind the machine and play the record over again , all by himself , and he was very careful . It was a fine machine . He wished he had one . About the time he had finished playing his sixth or seventh record , and George M. Cohan was singing " She 's a grand old rag , she 's a high-flying flag , and forever in peace may she wave , " he glanced at his father and discovered that he was grouchy about something . He was n't taking any part in the conversation but was sitting with his chin in his hand staring out of the window . Mr. Garfield was looking at him a little helplessly . His eyes met the boy 's and he motioned him over . " What do you find to do all summer ? Only child , are you ? " " No , sir . My brother 's in Whitemud . He 's twelve . He 's got a job . " " So you come out on the farm to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand on the boy 's shoulder and his voice was so kind that the boy lost his shyness and feltno embarrassment at all in being out there in the middle of the parlor with all of them watching . " I do n't help much , " he said . " I 'm too little to do anything but drive the stoneboat , Pa says . When I 'm twelve he 's going to get me a gun and then I can go hunting . " " Hunting ? " Mr. Garfield said . " What do you hunt ? " " Oh , gophers and weasels . I got a pet weasel . His name 's Lucifer . " " Well , " said Mr. Garfield . " You seem to be a pretty manly little chap . What do you feed your weasel ? " " Gophers . " The boy thought it best not to say that the gophers were live ones he threw into the weasel 's cage . He thought probably Mr. Garfield would be a little shocked at that . Mr. Garfield straightened up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a shame , " he said , " that there are so many predatory animals and pests in this country that we have to spend our time destroying them ? I hate killing things . " " I hate weasels , " the boy said . " I 'm just saving this one till he turns into an ermine , and then I 'm going to skin him . Once I speared a weasel with the pitchfork in the chicken coop and he dropped right off the tine and ran up my leg and bit me after he was speared clean through . " He finished breathlessly , and his mother smiled at him , motioning him not to talk so much . But Mr. Garfield was still looking at him kindly . " So you want to make war on the cruel things , the weasels and hawks , " he said . " Yes , sir , " the boy said . He looked at his mother and it was all right . He had n't spoiled anything by telling about the weasels . " Now that reminds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe I 've got something you 'd find useful . " He went into another room and came back with a .22 in his hand . " Could you use this ? " " I . . . yes , sir ! " the boy said . He had almost , in his excitement , said " I hope to whisk in your piskers , " because that was what his father always said when he meant anything real hard . " If your parents want you to have it , " Mr. Garfield said and raised his eyebrows at the boy 's mother . He did n't look at the father , but the boy did . " Can I , Pa ? " " I guess so , " his father said . " Sure . " " Thank Mr. Garfield nicely , " said his mother . " Gee , " the boy breathed . " Thanks , Mr. Garfield , ever so much . " " There 's a promise goes with it , " Mr. Garfield said . " I 'd like you to promise never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel ones like weasels and hawks . Never anything like birds or prairie dogs . " " How about butcher birds ? " " Butcher birds ? " Mr. Garfield said . " Shrikes , " said the boy 's mother . " We 've got some over by our place . They kill all sorts of things , snakes and gophers and other birds . They 're worse than the hawks because they just kill for the fun of it . " " By all means , " said Mr. Garfield . " Shoot all the shrikes you see . A thing that kills for the fun of it . . . " He shook his head and his voice got solemn , almost like the voice of Mr. McGregor , the Sunday School Superintendent in town , when he was asking the benediction . " There 's something about the way the war drags on , or maybe just this country , " he said , " that makes me hate killing . I just ca n't bear to shoot anything any more , even a weasel . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garfield and looked out of the window . One big brown hand , a little dirty from the wheel of the car , rubbed against the day-old bristles on his jaws . Then he stood up and stretched . " Well , we got to be going , " he said . " Oh , stay a little while , " Mr. Garfield said . " You just came . I wanted to show you my trees . " The boy 's mother stared at him . " Trees ? " He smiled . " Sounds a bit odd out here , does n't it ? But I think trees will grow . I 've made some plantings down below . " " I 'd love to see them , " she said . " Sometimes I 'd give almost anything to get into a good deep shady woods . Just to smell it , and feel how cool . . . " " There 's a little story connected with these , " Mr. Garfield said . He spoke to the mother alone , warmly . " When we first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if trees would n't grow we should n't stick it . That 's just what I said , ' If trees wo n't grow we sha n't stick it . ' Trees are almost the breath of life to me . " The boy 's father was shaken by a sudden spell of coughing , and the mother shot a quick look at him and looked back at Mr. Garfield with a light flush on her cheekbones . " I 'd love to see them , " she said . " I was raised in Minnesota , and I never will get used to a place as barren as this . " " When I think of the beeches back home in England , " Mr. Garfield said , and shook his head with a puckering smile round his eyes . The father lifted himself heavily out of his chair and followed the rest of them out to the coulee edge . Below them willows grew profusely along the almost-dry creek , and farther back from the water there was a grove of perhaps twenty trees about a dozen feet high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand dry weather , " Mr. Garfield said . The mother was looking down with all her longings suddenly plain and naked in her eyes . " It 's wonderful , " she said . " I 'd give almost anything to have some on our place . " " I found the willows close by here , " said Mr. Garfield . " Just at the south end of the hills they call Old-Man-onHis-Back , where the stream comes down . " " Stream ? " the boy 's father said . " You mean that trickle ? " " It 's not much of a stream , " Mr. Garfield said apologetically . " But . . " " Are there any more there ? " the mother said . " Oh , yes . You could get some . Cut them diagonally and push them into any damp ground . They 'll grow . " " They 'll grow about six feet high , " the father said . " Yes , " said Mr. Garfield . " They 're not , properly speaking , trees . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the father said rather loudly . " We better be getting on . " This time Mr. Garfield did n't object , and they went back to the car exchanging promises of visits . The father jerked the crank and climbed into the Ford , where the boy was sighting along his gun . " Put that down , " his father said . " Do n't you know any better than to point a gun around people ? " " It is n't loaded . " " They never are , " his father said . " Put it down now . " The Garfields were standing with their arms round each other 's waists , waiting to wave good-by . Mr. Garfield reached over and picked something from his wife 's dress . " What was it , Alfred ? " she said peering . " Nothing . Just a bit of fluff . " The boy 's father coughed violently and the car started with a jerk . With his head down almost to the wheel , still coughing , he waved , and the mother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set cedar posts of the pasture fence . They were almost a quarter of a mile away before the boy , with a last wave of the gun , turned round again and saw that his father was purple with laughter . He rocked the car with his joy , and when his wife said , " Oh , Harry , you big fool , " he pointed helplessly to his shoulder . " Would you mind , " he said . " Would you mind brushing that bit o ' fluff off me showldah ? " He roared again , pounding the wheel . " I shaw n't stick it , " he said . " I bloody well shaw n't stick it , you knaow ! " " It is n't fair to laugh at him , " she said . " He ca n't help being English . " " He ca n't help being a sanctimonious old mudhcn either , braying about his luv-ly luv-ly trees . They 'll freeze out the first winter . " " How do you know ? Maybe it 's like he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here as well as anywhere . " " Maybe there 's a gold mine in our back yard too , but I 'm not gon na dig to see . I could n't stick it . " " Oh , you 're just being stubborn , " she said . " Just because you did n't like Mr. Garfield . " He turned on her in heavy amazement . " Well , my God ! Did you ? " " I thought he was very nice , " she said , and sat straighter in the back seat , speaking loudly above the creak of the springs and cough of the motor . " They 're trying to make a home , not just a wheat crop . I liked them . " " Uh , huh . " He was not laughing any more now . Sitting beside him , the boy could see that his face had hardened and the cold look had come into his eye again . " So I should start talking like I had a mouthful of bran , and planting trees around the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I did n't say that . " " You thought it though . " He looked irritably at the sky , misted with the same delusive film of cloud that had fooled him for three days , and spat at the roadside . " You thought it all the time we were there . ' Why are n't you more like Mr. Garfield , he 's such a nice man . ' " With mincing savagery he swung round and mocked her . " Shall I make it a walnut grove ? Or a big maple sugar bush ? Or maybe you 'd like an orange orchard . " The boy was looking down at his gun , trying not to hear them quarrel , but lie knew what his mother 's face would be like  --  hurt and a little flushed , her chin trembling into stubbornness . " I do n't suppose you could bear to have a rug on the floor , or a gramophone ? " she said . He smacked the wheel hard . " Of course I could bear it if we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do without than be like that old sandhill crane . " " I do n't suppose you 'd like to take me over to the Old-Man-on-His-Back some day to get some willow slips either . " " What for ? " " To plant down in the coulee , by the dam . " " That dam dries up every August . Your willows would n't live till snow flies . " " Well , would it do any harm to try ? " " Oh , shut up ! " he said , " Just thinking about that guy and his fluff and his trees gives me the pleefer . " The topless Ford lurched , one wheel at a time , through the deep burnout by their pasture corner , and the boy clambered out with his gun in his hand to slip the loop from the three-strand gate . It was then that he saw the snake , a striped limp ribbon , dangling on the fence , and a moment later the sparrow , neatly butchered and hung by the throat from the barbed wire . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Lookit what the butcher bird 's been doing . " His father 's violent hand waved at him from the seat . " Come on Get the wire out of the way ! " The boy dragged the gate through the dust , and the Ford went through and up behind the house , perched on the bare edge of the coulee in the midst of its baked yard and framed by the dark fireguard overgrown with Russian thistle . Walking across that yard a few minutes later , the boy felt its hard heat under his sneakers , There was hardly a spear of grass within the fireguard . It was one of his father 's prides that the dooryard should be like cement . " Pour your wash water out long enough , " he said , " and you 'll have a surface so hard it wo n't even make mud . " Religiously he threw his water out three times a day , carrying it sometimes a dozen steps to dump it on a dusty or grassy spot . The mother had objected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of an alkali flat , and why they could n't letgrass grow up to the door . But he snorted her down . Everything round the house ought to he bare as a bone . Get a good prairie fire going and it 'd jump that guard like nothing , and if they had grass to the door where 'd they be ? She said why not plow a wider fireguard then , one a fire could n't jump , but he said he had other things to do besides plowing fifty-foot fireguards . They were arguing inside when the boy came up on the step to sit down and aim his empty .22 at a fencepost . Apparently his mother had been persistent , and persistence when he was not in a mood for it angered the father worse than anything else . Their talk came vaguely through his concentration , but he shut his ears on it . If that spot on the fencepost was a coyote now , and he held the sight steady , right on it , and pulled the trigger , that old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come down dead as a mackerel , and he could tack his hide on the barn the way Mr. Larsen had one , only the dogs had jumped and torn the tail and hind legs off Mr. Larsen 's pelt , and he would n't get more than the three-dollar bounty out of it . But then Mr. Larsen had shot his with a shotgun anyway , and the hide was n't worth much even before the dogs tore it . . . . " I ca n't for the life of me see why not , " his mother said inside . " We could do it now . We 're not doing anything else . " " I tell you they would n't grow ! " said his father with emphasis on every word . " Why should we run our tongues out doing everything that mealy-mouthed fool does ? " " I do n't want anything but the willows . They 're easy . " He made his special sound of contempt , half-snort , half-grunt . After a silence she tried again . " They might even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks they 'd grow , and he used to work in a greenhouse , his wife told me . " " This is n't a greenhouse , for Chris-sake . " " Oh , let it go , " she said . " I 've stood it this long without any green things around . I guess I can stand it some more . " The boy , aiming now toward the gate where the butcher bird , coming back to his prey , would in just a minute fly right into Deadeye 's unerring bullet , heard his father stand up suddenly . " Abused , are n't you ? " he said . The mother 's voice rose . " No , I 'm not abused ! Only I ca n't see why it would be so awful to get some willows . Just because Mr. Garfield gave me the idea , and you did n't like him . . . " " You 're right I did n't like Mr. Garfield , " the father said . " He gave me a pain right under the crupper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitterly , " he calls his wife ' dear ' and puts his arm around her and likes trees . It would n't occur to you to put your arm around your wife , would it ? " The boy aimed and held his breath . His mother ought to keep still , because if she did n't she 'd get him real mad and then they 'd both have to tiptoe around the rest of the day . He heard his father 's breath whistle through his teeth , and his voice , mincing , nasty . " Would you like me to kiss you now , dear ? " " I would n't let you touch me with a ten-foot pole , " his mother said . She sounded just as mad as he did , and it was n't often she let herself get that way . The boy squirmed over when he heard the quick hard steps come up behind him and pause . Then his father 's big hand , brown and meaty and felted with fine black hair , reached down over his shoulder and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Scissor-bill gave you , " he said . It was a single-shot , bolt-action Savage , a little rusty on the barrel , the bolt sticky with hardened grease when the father removed it . Sighting up through the barrel , he grunted . " Takes care of a gun like he takes care of his farm . Probably used it to cultivate his luv-Iy trees . " He went out into the sleeping porch , and after a minute came back with a ragand a can of machine oil . Hunching the boy over on the step , he sat down and began rubbing the bolt with the oil-soaked rag . " I just ca n't bear to shoot anything any more , " he said , and laughed suddenly . " I just caw n't stick it , little man . " He leered at the boy , who grinned back uncertainly . Squinting through the barrel again , the father breathed through his nose and clamped his lips together , shaking his head . The sun lay heavy on the baked yard . Out over the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time , so that his light breast feathers flashed as he banked and rose . Just wait , the boy thought . Wait till I get my gun working and I 'll fix you , you hen-robber . He thought of the three chicks a hawk had struck earlier in the summer , the three balls of yellow with the barred mature plumage just coming through . Two of them dead when he got there and chased the hawk away , the other gasping with its crap slashed wide open and the wheat spilling from it on the ground . His mother had sewed up the crop , and the chicken had lived , but it always looked droopy , like a plant in drought time , and sometimes it would stand and work its bill as if it were choking . By golly , he thought , I 'll shoot every hawk and butcher bird in twenty miles . I 'll . . . " Rustle around and find me a piece of baling wire , " his father said . " This barrel looks like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rusty wire , brought it back and watched his father straighten it , wind a bit of rag round the end , ram it up and down through the barrel , and peer through again . " He 's leaded her so you can hardly see the grooves , " he said . " But maybe she 'll shoot . We 'll fill her with vinegar and cork her up to-night . " The mother was behind them , leaning against the jamb and watching . She reached down and rumpled the father 's black hair . " The minute you get a gun in your hand you start feeling better , " she said . " It 's just a shame you were n't born fifty years sooner . " " A gun 's a good tool , " he said . " It had n't ought to be misused . Gun Iike this is enough to make a guy cry . " " Well , you 've got to admit it was nice of Mr. Garfield to give it to Sonny , " she said . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling somehow that she knew it was the wrong thing to say , that she said it just to have one tiny triumph over him . He knew it would make him boiling mad again , even before he heard his father 's answer . " Oh , sure , Mr. Garfield 's a fine man . He can preach a better sermon than any homesteader in Saskatchewan . God Almighty ! everything he does is better than what I do . All right . All right , all right ! Why the hell do n't you move over there if you likc it so well ? " " If you were n't so blind . . . ! " He rose with the .22 in his hand and pushed past her into the house . " I 'm not so blind , " he said heavily in passing . " You 've been throwing that bastard up to me for two hours . It do n't take very good eyes to see what that means . " His mother started to say , " All because I want a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her , anxious to help the situation somehow . " Will it shoot now ? " he said . His father said nothing . His mother looked down at him , shrugged , sighed , smiled bleakly with a tight mouth . She moved aside when the father came back with a box of cartridges in his hand . He ignored his wife , speaking to the boy alone in the particular half-jocular tone he always used with him or the dog when he was n't mad or exasperated . " Thought I had these around , " he said . " Now we 'll see what this smoke-pole will do . " He slipped a cartridge in and locked the bolt , looking round for something to shoot at . Behind him the mother 's feet moved on the floor , and her voice came purposefully . " I ca n't see why you have to act this way , " she said . " I 'm going over and get some slips myself . " There was a long silence . The angled shade lay sharp as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek was pressed against the stock of the gun , his arms and hands as steady as stone . " How 'll you get there ? " he said , whispering down the barrel . " I 'll walk . " " Five miles and back . " " Yes , five miles and back . Or fifty miles and back . If there was any earthly reason why you should mind . . . " " I do n't mind , " he said , and his voice was soft as silk . " Go ahead . " Close to his mother 's long skirts in the doorway , the boy felt her stiffen as if she had been slapped . He squirmed anxiously , but his desperation could find only the question he had asked before . His voice squeaked on it : " Will it shoot now ? " " See that sparrow out there ? " his father said , still whispering . " Right out by that cactus ? " " Harry ! " the mother said . " If you shoot that harmless little bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark face against the rifle stock , the locked , immovable left arm , the thick finger crooked inside the trigger guard almost too small to hold it . He saw the sparrow , gray , white-breasted , hopping obliviously in search of bugs , fifty feet out on the gray earth . " I just . . . ca n't . . . bear . . . to . . . shoot . . . anything , " the father said , his face like dark stone , his lips hardly moving . " I just . . ca n't . . . stick it ! " " Harry ! " his wife screamed . The boy 's mouth opened , a dark wash of terror shadowed his vision of the baked yard cut by its sharp angle of shade . " Do n't , pa ! " The rocklike figure of his father never moved . The thick finger squeezed slowly down on the trigger , there was a thin , sharp report , and the sparrow jerked and collapsed into a shapeless wad on the ground . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all its clean outlines vanished . Head , feet , the white breast , the perceptible outlines of the folded wings , disappeared all at once , were crumpled together and lost , and the boy sat beside his father on the step with the echo of the shot still in his ears . He did not look at either of his parents . He looked only at the crumpled sparrow . Step by step , unable to keep away , he went to it , stooped , and picked it up . Blood stained his fingers , and he held the bird by the tail while he wiped the smeared hand on his overalls , He heard the click as the bolt was shot and the empty cartridge ejected , and he saw his mother come swiftly out of the house past his father , who sat still on the step . Her hands were clenched , and she walked with her head down , as if fighting tears . " Ma ! " the boy said dully . " Ma , what 'll I do with it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they faced each other . He saw the dead pallor of her face , the burning eyes , the not-quite-controllable quiver of her lips . But her words , when they came , were flat and level , almost casual .

" ANSWER TO ONE BY LOUISE McNEILL N O , you are right , Love will not pay the butcher Nor light a beacon on the cellar stair . When we hid naked and the black winds found us Love was not there .
