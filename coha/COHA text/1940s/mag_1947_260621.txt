Between flashing lines of saluting soldiers , the philosophers , scholars , and educators of UNESCO slowly walked to take their places in the great hall of Mexico City 's Bellas Artes . Somber and unsmiling , Mexico 's President Alenian greeted them . The second world conference of UNESCO had begun . <P> What had UNESCO accomplished in its first year of existence ? Lean , leathery Director-General Julian Huxley did his dutiful best to put a good face on it . UNESCO had distributed $72 million worth of books and educational equipment . It had helped restore some 2,000 libraries throughout the world , and it had laid plans , but done nothing yet , to combat illiteracy in Haiti ( TIME , May 12 ) , British East Africa and China . It had sponsored seminars and conferences , and spent a lot of time talking about what its job should be . <P> Reported TIME Correspondent John Stanton : " As Huxley stood there dryly reciting his report , he seemed a perfect example of what two exhausting wars had done to the brains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , apparently robbed of all illusion . " The U.S. delegates were full of admen 's fervor and preoccupation with big , bold campaigns . They wanted to set up a worldwide radio network right now , and figure how &; what to say over it later . They had charts to show that the world 's press , and its film industry , could be used by UNESCO . <P> Their proposals were greeted somewhat skeptically . Said one listener : " How can the United Nations preach freedom , democracy and the road to peace , when the nations themselves can not agree on the text ? "
