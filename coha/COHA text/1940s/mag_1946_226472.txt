For the first time since before the war , the traditional riot call of " Rinehart ! " * sounded again through the Harvard Yard . Since every Harvardman is either a little liberal or else a little conservative , ostensibly the trouble had something to do with politics . The Liberal Union was marching through the Yard , protesting Winston Churchill 's " warmongering . " Partisans of the Conservative League decided to break up the parade , and-Rinehart ! The riotous reason was really spring , and like a maenadic overtone sounded the shrill , feminine piping of Radcliffe girls , now virtually coeds at Harvard . <P> Radcliffe girls were admitted to Harvard classes during the war because of teacher shortages . Announcing that the girls will stay on in peacetime , Harvard beat the coed devil around the bush by calling this " joint instruction . " <P> Reaction to " joint instruction " was varied . Said a Radcliffe sophomore : " You 're just bound to find the situation distracting unless you 're a great brain . " Said Professor Payson Wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and woman fruitful . " Harvard Senior Roger MacDougal , who takes the historic Harvard view that Radcliffe girls are unspeakably undatable , spoke for the Harvard masses . Said he : " The peaches are all right , but oh , those lemons ! " <P> <P> Vassar College , at a special night session of the faculty last week , voted to admit men as nonresident students until the school shortage for ex-G.I.s ends . Some 50 promptly applied . The girls at Long Island 's Adelphi College voted 3-to-i to admit men , but trustees decided to think the idea over . <P> * Named after a lonely grind of the 1900s who ( the story goes ) grieved because no friends called on spring nights , went below his own window in the Yard and shouted his own name .
