Germany 's newest song hit was hummed in streetcars , in movie theaters and at political meetings . Radio Berlin used the opening bars for a musical call signal . Its slow march tune was catchy , and its lyrics fitted Berlin 's melancholy mood : <P> Far and wide as the eye can wander , <P> Heath and bog are everywhere . <P> Not a bird sings out to cheer us , <P> Oaks are standing gaunt and bare . <P> We are the peat-bog soldiers , <P> We 're marching with our spades to the bog . . . . <P> But for us there is no complaining , <P> Winter will in time be past . <P> One day we shall cry rejoicing : <P> Homeland dear , you 're mine at last ! <P> Berlin 's new hit is actually 13 years old . It was first sung in 1933 by prisoners in the Brgermoor concentration camp as they marched off to drain the nearby peat bogs . Prisoners secretly wrote it on barracks walls , whispered it at slave labor chores ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans took it to Spain with them , taught it to their comrades in the International Brigade . As The Peat-Bog Soldiers it was brought to the U.S. by Loyalist veterans , recorded by Paul Robeson.
