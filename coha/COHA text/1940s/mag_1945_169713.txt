The biggest labor news of the week was a rumor . <P> The rumor was that Henry Ford II , undisputed boss of the Ford empire , had offered the C.I.O. 's United Automobile Workers a wage increase of 23% . This was just 7% below U.A.W. 's demand . <P> Ford denied it ; the U.A.W. was coy . But there was ample foundation for the belief that Young Henry would make the U.A.W. an ample offer . Young Henry wants more than anything else to make Ford first in automobiles . He also has a strong leaning toward his grandfather 's tradition of high wages and low prices . If he could beat other motor manufacturers to the draw with a U.A.W. wage settlement , he might well be away out in front in the great race to feed the hungry market for new motorcars . <P> Such a settlement would also have its effect on the politics of the U.A.W. , the world 's largest union . It was U.A.W. 's smart , redheaded Vice President Walter Reuther who two months ago first disclosed U.A.W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one , starting with General Motors . Reuther is in charge of U.A.W. 's G.M. division , and a settlement at Ford would give him a potent weapon in dealing with General Motors . It might also help him in his continued fight with U.A.W. 's left-wing Vice President George Addes . Reuther , with a substantial lead already over Addes , is now attempting to gather the laurels which he hopes will make him successor next year , to U.A.W. 's good-natured , generally ineffectual President R. J. Thomas . <P> There is little doubt that General Motors is as worried about Ford 's impending wage settlement as it is about U.A.W. 's demands . If Ford settles , G.M. will be faced with the alternatives of making a somewhat similar agreement or starting out on a protracted strike . Last week Detroit buzzed with another report : that Young Henry Ford had sat down to dinner at the Detroit Athletic Club with G.M. 's Wilson and Chrysler 's K. T. Keller to discuss the possibility of a united front against U.A.W. 's demands . <P> Ford and U.A.W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meantime , Ford devoutly hopes to hear from OPA about prices . The Nov. 20 meeting might have a big influence on getting Detroit-and the rest of the country-back to work .
