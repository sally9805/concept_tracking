One of the most popular educational shows at the New York World 's Fair is the Medicine &; Public Health exhibit . In the shadowy Hall of Man stand countless glorifications of the human body-a swaying four-foot ear , a talking skeleton , a mechanical biceps , a huge plaster brain studded with push buttons .
