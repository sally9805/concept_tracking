Possibly the first large section of U.S. citizenry to achieve a gas mask for every adult is Hawaii . This week the Territory is fast achieving an even more exciting goal-a " bunny mask " for each of its 50,000 infants . <P> A grizzled , hard-bitten veteran of World War I , Colonel George F. Unmacht , Hawaiian Coordinator for Civilian Gas Defense , is the creator of the bunny mask . With a Jap gas attack always a dread possibility , Colonel Unmacht decided that he " wanted something that would temporarily protect very young children from the effects of poison gas until they could be removed from the gas area . " His emergency solution was to set the women stitching together sacks which , when impregnated with gas-resistant chemicals , could be drawn over infants ' heads and tied tightly at the bottom . But how would a child like to have his head thrust into a sack ? <P> One day as he watched his Hawaiian volunteer workers , Colonel Unmacht had his big idea . He told the women to fold back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resemble rabbit ears . Then he asked Hawaiian hospitals for old X-ray negatives washed clean with acid . The negatives made transparent plastic windows for the front of Colonel Unmacht 's bunny masks . At latest reports Hawaiian moppets are so eager to play rabbit in the new masks that parents are being asked to keep all bunny masks laid safely away for a real emergency .
