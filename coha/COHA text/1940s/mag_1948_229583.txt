After one ride on the Long Island Rail Road , the average man has difficulty talking . After two he can not stop . If he is a newly hatched commuter , he indulges in shocked and vehement tirades against the road 's rickety locomotives , its profane and belligerent trainmen , its aged and odoriferous cars . If he is a veteran , he may speak of the Long Island almost admiringly-like a wife-beater 's bride telling the girls how her husband knocked her into the china closet . But , young or old , he shares with his fellow commuters one vibrating conviction : that it is the worst railroad in the world . <P> Since it is also the nation 's biggest commuter road ( it carries 110,000 people daily between Long Island 's suburban reaches and Manhattan 's echoing Pennsylvania Station ) , it has probably been cursed more consistently than any other institution in the history of man . But last month it stirred its critics to new heights . As New York 's record 25.8-inch snowfall descended , the Long Island got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3,500 people in icy day coaches , and did not completely extricate itself for six long days . <P> Filthy Cars . Last week , throngs of still-throbbing commuters gathered at a public hearing in Manhattan to vent their pent-up spleen , and to demand reforms . One witness complained that he had spent twelve hours in a cold train and had been forced to eat snow off the window sills " to moisten my throat . " He could hardly be heard ; he explained , hoarsely , that he had caught a horrible cold in the process . <P> One Reid A. Curtis of Merrick , L.I . testified that the conductor of a stalled train had directed passengers to get out into the snow if they did n't like the service . The railroad 's attorney interrupted : " Do you mean that a Long Island employee used those words to you-get out ? " Said Curtis : " Well-no . He said , ' Get the hell out . ' " <P> Though the hearing was supposed to concern itself only with the storm , dozens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran late , of " filthy cars and broken-down locomotives . " The hall rang with applause and whistling as one witness cried : " These people should be indicted for criminal negligence . " <P> Clean Windows . The Long Island , however , seemed unimpressed . Its superintendent , Eugene L. Hofmann , blandly blamed the tie-up on inadequate reporting by the weather bureau . He also boasted a little . In the snarled-up days of the Big Snow , not a single person had been killed , he said . The Long Island 's pressagent announced : " We take the philosophic view . It 's no good to lose your temper . I did n't even get mad when some U.N . official called up and wanted to punch me in the nose . " <P> This did not mean , . however , that the Long Island Rail Road was totally unmoved by the hearing , nor completely un-solicitous of the comfort of its restive passengers . At week 's end it hastily washed the windows on several of its trains . This was an astonishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe eyestrain contracted during their first view of the fleeting countryside .
