Americans enjoy nothing more than entertaining a king , but so many monarchs have been socially disqualified-either for thronelessness , chasing starlets or consorting with the nation 's enemies-that there is seldom a chance to singe one with the full , hot blast of democratic hospitality . Last week , however , U.S. officialdom , U.S. hostesses , and U.S. foreign-relations societies had converged with a shout on the genuine article . The target : the Shah of Iran . <P> The handsome Shah ( full title : His Imperial Majesty Mohamed Reza Pahlevi , Shahinshah of Iran ) , a lean , sad-eyed young ( 30 ) monarch , might have been born &; bred for the guinea hen &; champagne circuit . He was a bachelor ( having divorced beauteous Princess Fawzia of Egypt in 1948 ) , had a gratifyingly deferential way with the ladies , had a democratic fondness for crowds and machinery , and seemed genuinely moved by his reception . <P> Adventures in Manhattan . Somewhat to the surprise of his welcomers , he also proved to be a thoughtful , articulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic and military help from the U.S. He took great pains to explain that he was not " an Oriental potentate , but a modern , liberal , constitutional monarch whose powers . . . are somewhat less than those of the King of Sweden . " <P> His New York adventures began , after five days of entertainment in Washington ( TiME , Nov. 28 ) , as he rode from the Battery to City Hall in an open car ( drawing a street crowd of 200,000 and a flattering paper shower ) to receive an official reception from Mayor William O'Dwyer . In 72 hours he spoke at three banquets and three luncheons , paid post-midnight calls on a series of nightclubs , went to three museums , visited the Arab library at Princeton University and inspected the pressrooms of the Newark News . <P> He also made a quick trip to the United States Military Academy at West Point . On arrival he was told that century-old tradition permitted him , as a head of state , to make and receive one request during his visit . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of discipline , and some 80 promptly had their privileges restored . At Hyde Park , where he had Thanksgiving dinner with Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt , he spied a handsome Persian rug which he had presented to F.D.R. six years ago . Beaming , he got down on his knees , fingered it , and made a short talk on the technique of Oriental rug making . ( The test of a good Persian rug : at least 100 knots per square inch . ) <P> The Shah Goes West . Next day he flew to Detroit in the presidential DC-6 Independence , was immediately hustled off in a long , gleaming motorcade to inspect automobile plants . At the Cadillac factory he asked final-assembly workers so many questions that cars began coming off the end of the line unfinished . He also appeared at two more dinners , greeted his kid brother Mahmoud , a tall , handsome senior at the University of Michigan , and startled a reporter who asked him what he thought of American women . " I see many of them in the streets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't see many pregnant . "
