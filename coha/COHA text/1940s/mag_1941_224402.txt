In outer Los Angeles harbor , 13 crack skippers last week matched wits for one of the most coveted of yachting prizes : the Star Class world championship . Star boats ( 22-footers costing anywhere from $700 to $2,000 ) are not the most popular sailboats in the U.S.* But they are the most cosmopolitan-a one-design class that boasts fleets in 40 different countries . <P> Last week 's regatta , the 20th in the history of the International Star Class Yacht Racing Association , had no European entries . Only foreign boat was the Cuban Kurush , owned by Havana 's Dr. Carlos de Cardenas . Brightest of the Cuban fleet , Kurush proved no shining star in the Pacific . Neither did Manhattan Undertaker Frank E. Campbell 's black Rascal , the flying ghost that had doomed all rival Stars on Long Island Sound this summer . Even Sailmaker Harry Nye Jr . ' s Gale , from Lake Michigan , the boat that won this year 's Bacardi Cup at Havana , took a lot of wake last week . <P> In four of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Scout won the first , second and fifth races , would have sailed off with the championship had he not been disqualified in the fourth race when his sail touched a windward mark . Winner of the series-with a total point score of 58-was Wench , skippered by George Fleitz , a 25-year-old Los Angeles yacht broker . <P> At the victory ball , Champion Fleitz , like his 19 predecessors , received a big silver cup , the " Blue Ribbon of the Seven Seas . " But this year 's rendezvous seemed strange to many an oldtimer . Absent for the first time was the Stars ' founder , patron saint and Commodore , George A. ' ( " Pop " ) Corry of Port Washington , L.I . <P> Pop Corry , now crowding 79 , is the Grand Old Man of sailing . In his battered Little Dipper , one of the original 22 Stars that were built on Long Island 30 years ago , he competed in New York 's Larchmont Regatta this summer ( for the 43rd straight year ) , finished 24th in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Wench , the story might have been different . But the Commodore would no sooner part with his Little Dipper than the 480 trophies she won for him . In 1912 , the year after the Stars were born , he won 20 firsts and five seconds in 26 races-a feat never since equaled by any Star skipper . <P> When sailing , Pop wears a stiff wing collar , smokes a pipe . " The pipe is my wind gauge , " he says . " On a mild day , a change of wind may be barely perceptible but when the smoke changes on the old pipe , I can trim her in and save perhaps 50 feet . To get the benefit of every little breeze on a mild day , I smoke until my throat is sore . " <P> Last week , while fellow sailors breezed around Los Angeles , Commodore Corry was at home-not because he was too feeble but because his wife was ailing . For a septuagenarian , Pop Corry is unusually spry , still walks four or five miles a day-just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manhattan stores . His spryness he attributes to his daily practice of standing on his head for five minutes before breakfast . " Keeps me limber , " says he .
