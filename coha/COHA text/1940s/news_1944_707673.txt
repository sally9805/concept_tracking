txt NEXT NOVEMBER assumes a dominant place in the long range tax picture . That 's the significance of statements issued last Friday by Secretary Morgenthau and by Representative-Doughton and Senator George . chairmen of the tax committees in Congress . In effect . they , declared a taxwriting holiday as soon as the tax simplification job now in process is finished . They recognized. ( 1i That passage of the simplification measure before the political conventions in June would be well nigh impossible if it were complicated either by revenue requests from the Administration or so-called " administrative changes " advocated by some in Congress : ( 2 ) that another major tax bill after mid-summer is not politically feasible . . THE IMPORTANT THING about the **26;652;TOOLONG announcement was that it confirms a ? situation which has been pointing up for has not been inclined to go much beyond individual income tax simplification But Senator George has voiced a desire to take up post-war reserves ( which he now discards ) : Senator Danaher wants repeal of the capital stock and declared value excess profits taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroads . While either committee could overrule its chairman on the exclusion of these and other issues , it is unlikely . ? ? . WHAT TAX PLANS does the G.O.P. have ? Part of the answer may be furnished by the 25-man tax research committee named this week by House Republican Leader Martin . The first job of the committee will he to shape and smooth the tax planks in the Republican election platform . It will emphasize the effects of taxation on business . concentrating on two phases : ( 11 Maximum expansion of production to increase employment . ( 2 ) release of restraints on " risk " capital to make private . instead of public . money available to industry ? ? . DISREGABD REPORTS that tax withholding will be broadened to collect on incomes from dividends . interest , rents and royalties Changes in the mechanics of withholding now being considered at the Capitol do not include this feature , vi-hiets would impose a heavy adnbnistraUve burden on banks . ? ONE POSSIBILITY being explored by the Ways and Nleans Committee would permit more taxpayers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons whose income ( not mote than S3.000 ) is confined to wages . salaries ( including bonuses and commissions dividends . interest'and annuities may use this form . Taxpayers with income from business . rents , royalties. farming . etc. are excluded . It is this group the committee would like to bring in . Changes in the short form designed to make its use more generally advantageous also are in the mill . This would be done by increasing the " presumptive deduction "  --  the amount the Government , presumes the average taxpa.er normally would deduct lot taxes interest , charity and the like . At present . the presumption is 6 , , of gross income Those whose actual deductions range above that sate find it profitable to file the longer form Inci4 , asing the presumption to 8 , ' , would make 1040-A profitable to more people . ? ? ? SOCIAL SECURITY amendments are dormant for the rest of the year along with other tax matters Rept e.sentative Dingell ( Dem .. Mich i , chief proponent in the Ways and Means Ccmimittee for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate , will seek hearings by that group when the House disposes of the simplification bill . General opposition to this procedure includes Chairman Doughton and it is doubtful that even strong Administration pressure could force the committee to act in 1944 . ? ? ? A POSER for many carom. el tains is whether or not to use the option permitted by amendments to the last  --  in-first-out inventory provisions of the Revenue Law . It involves a guess and a sample on the post-war trend of commodity prices This is the situation . Companies using iast-in-first-out ( LIFO the accountants call it establish an inventory " base " ( involving the quantity and value of their inventory ) each year . Thus . if their stocks of material are depleted  --  fall below the " base " amount ? they in effect are taking a short position in the goods in question . Because of wartime conditions many companies have been forced to " go short " in this way . If they cover ( replace inventories ) at higher prices than their ' base " they lose money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized this plight of LIFO companies and in the 1942 Tax Act endeavored to mitigate the speculative element . Such companies were permitted . when the reduction of stocks was due to causes beyond the companies ' control , toaapply replacements made within three years of the war 's end to the year , or years , in which the shortages occurred and to recompute earnings and taxes for that period on this basis . However , such permission applied only to 1942 and subsequent years although many companies were faced with such a situation arising in 1941 . The 1943 Tax Act extended the relief to 1941 . Thus , six months from date of passage of this act a company is allowed to file notice of intention to take advantage of the section . It boils down to this  --  such companies must decide now whether to " cover ' their shortages at 1941 price levels , which they do it they file notice , or take a chance ul lower price levels after the war . Thus . if prices go down a company would wind up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that year .
