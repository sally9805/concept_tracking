The sirens wailed . An air raid . <P> Los Angeles citizens crawled out of beds and goggled at the moon . The city had been blacked out . Suddenly , from dozens of Army anti-aircraft posts , searchlights lanced the dark . Orange bursts blossomed in the sky . The city shook with the concussion of ack-ack guns . For almost two hours , except for one 15-minute interval of scary silence , batteries coughed steadily , spewed 1,430 rounds of ammunition into the night . <P> Los Angelenos had no doubt that they were being attacked . Early morning extras confirmed the fact . Said the Los Angeles Times : " Roaring out of a brilliant moonlit western sky , foreign aircraft flying both in large formation and singly , flew over Southern California . ... At 5 a.m. the police reported that an airplane had been shot down near 185th St. " <P> There were casualties-but not from bombs . Three citizens had been killed in auto crashes . An air-raid warden had died of a heart attack . Windows had been smashed and several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garbage pail through a jewelry-store window to black-out a neon sign . One woman was yanked out of bed by police , and hauled off to jail for failing to black-out her house . She sobbed : " One of the officers slapped my face . I 'm going to tell that to the judge . " Stalled for almost five hours , traffic choked the streets , caused the worst jam in the city 's history . <P> No one found any shot-down plane ; no one reported any bombed-out home . Rumors were thick as flack : that the Army had shot its 1,430 rounds at an escaped barrage balloon ; that enemy planes had been reconnoitering ; that the target was a lone U.S. plane trying to land ; that the Army was staging a show to wake people up . The Western Defense Command said : " Unidentified aircraft were reported in the Los Angeles area . " <P> <P> In Washington , Navy 's Secretary Knox smiled indulgently and cracked : " Just a false alarm . " Army 's Secretary Stimson challenged him by reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flatly : " As many as 15 planes may have been involved . " One Army theory was that the planes came from commercial fields , were operated by enemy agents to locate gun positions and to slow up production by causing a blackout . The ships , said the report , were flying at heights ranging from 9,000 to 18,000 feet . <P> Practiced observers ( newsmen , officers , soldiers ) on the scene backed up the Army report . The planes which they swore they had seen had moved slowly across the night sky , evidently circling . Observers also reported that anti-aircraft bursts were considerably short of the point where searchlights converged , despite the theoretical longer range of the ack-ack guns ; only about half of the shells burst at all , indicating lots of duds . <P> A foreign correspondent recently returned from London ( where he endured the blitzes of 1940 and 1941 ) commented : <P> " Until there is a danger that Los Angeles-or any other American city- will be bombed continually by large numbers of planes , it will be better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and anti-aircraft barrages . The damage that 15 or 20 planes could do at night is nothing compared with the loss of man hours , discomfort and general turmoil . <P>
