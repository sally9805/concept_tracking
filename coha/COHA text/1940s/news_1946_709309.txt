txt Letters to . The Times To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK ' MuEs : Both the State and Federal Governments have recently called attention to important current needs in education . A significant bill has been introduced in Albany by Senator T. C. Desmond to establish a State institute in criminology . Attorney General Clark has lately organized a panel of specialists to study the growth of youthful offenses . The volume of delinquency and crime in New York , its costs to the people of the State , and current trends in official thinking point up this ' problem . In the pre-war year 1940 there was an average daily population in New York . State correctional institutions of more than 18,000 , nearly three times the figure of 1920 . Another 30,000 were on probation and more than 10,000 on parole . These services cost the citizens of New York in excess of $16,000,000 for the year , close to five times the expenditure in 1920 . Juvenile Crime on Increase In New York City for several years we have spent in the neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moreover , crime experts today indicate that we may expect a further upsurge of crime and its costs . During the war , according to J. Edgar Hoover , arrests of boys under 18 increased 50 to 100 per cent for serious felonies , and the rate of increase was nearly 200 per cent for girls under 18 . It becomes obviously and tragically important that these offenders be better understood and that their treatment be made more effective . The situation calls for thought and action in which our universities have a responsibility . One important educational objective today is to apply institutional resources more fully to public problems and policy . The need is clear for more intensive study in criminology to discover the causes of crime , the developments in administering justice and the methods of treating criminals more purposively . We must also come to apply a many-sided approach to the complex problems of crime . The large university of today , with its graduate and professional schools , could provide a better coordinated study than has been available in the past to students of criminology . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judge , lawyer , prosecutor , and to the personnel of our social agencies and treatment institutions ; to scholar and researcher , we may now bring a more complete study of criminology and criminal law which is needed . Today we can provide a combined approach of research in criminology with the study of criminal law and its administration , with criminal and forensic psychiatry , and with the fields of social work , public administration and education . Special Need in City An institute such as that proposed by Senator Desmond could study the criminal directly to discover those factors of mentality and physique and those conditions of home , neighborhood and community environment which are associated with violation of the law . It could stimulate and contribute to further creative work in the growing sciences of crime detection . The operation of our criminal courts , both their procedures and goals , could be studied at first hand , and the effectiveness of the administration of criminal justice appraised , to the end of improving current practice . In New York City there is a special need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city 's courts , institutions , governmental and social agencies , there is a favorable situation to collaborate with these facilities to increase our knowledge and improve our methods . Moreover , since criminal behavior is only one aspect of all behavior , we may , through the development of a science of criminology , come to a better understanding of normal conduct . RUFUS D. SMITH , Provost , New York University . New York , Feb. 28 , 1946 . TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TDIES : Your Feb. 23 editorial " Revolt in the East " points lip an issue that not only is more explosive than the atomics : bomb but may well become the rally ing cry for a third world war . The vie lence , strikes and widespread unrest throughout Asia , Africa , the South Pa cific and the Caribbean all spring from the desire of the native populations for ' freedom , and their natural resentment of continued oppression and exploitation . The war just ended was fought , St ( we were told , for the Four Freedoms It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was fought to give men throughout the earth the right to have governments of their own choosing . In light of these objectives , con ! sider the following facts : Eight million Belgians control ten million Congolese who have no voice in their Gov ernment . Nine million Netherlanders ? represent sixty million brown men in , the South Seas . In the Union of South . Africa two million whites hold eight million black natives in virtual slavery ; and taking the British Empire , we find -- that fifty million whites control the destinies of four hundred and fifty million yellow , brown and black people . In addition , it is interesting to note . that those nations ground most ruthlessly under the Nazi heel are most in7. sistent upon the status quo ante bellum . France , Italy , Belgium and the Netherlands are all putting forth herculean efforts for a return of their colonies . What this portends for the . future was succinctly stated by Sumner . Welles in a recent broadcast : " It is impossible to conceive of a peacefuF world were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tha right of a few nations of western Eli -- rope to dominate almost three quartei ; s ? of a billion of human beings , many of whom are at this moment struggling ' for liberty and many of whom are ready for self-government . " When this is contrasted with Mr. Bevin 's recent assertion in Parliament : " I am not prepared to sacrifice the British Empire , it is small wonder that the native populations have taken matters into their own hands . Grotius , in " The Rights of War and Peace , " set forth the idea that , accord ing to the law of nature , a war is " just " if fought for any one of three reasons  --  for defense , for the recovery of property unjustly taken , or for the righting of a wrong committed . Using this , then , - as a criterion , we find not one but all three reasons abundantly present in the instant situation . Whether it actually spills over into a world-wide ' conflagration depends en.i. tirely upon the degree of statesman= ship and justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness is one of the major transformations of human history . Your editorial is on solid ground when you declare : " We may be certain , however , that the imperialism of the white race over the colored races is passing Whether the imperial powers know it our not , their hour has struck , the tide has turned ; whether they move with it or against it , free men everywhere are on the march . COLDEN BROWN . New York , Feb. 28 , 1946 . Study of Crime Essential Desmond Proposal for State Institute of Criminology Favored the long future of a world to be made safe for democracy . " Or they use excuses such as " the cost of bringing these boys home , " or that " they ara now buried in hallowed ground . " The land where these men were born should be their final resting place , and I can see nothing hallowed about that foreign ground . True , it is soaked with the blood of our children , twice in my generation , but that does not make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bodies of our loved ones , for it has been nothing but a slaughter- , house , and there is nothing sacral ? about a slaughterhouse . If these boys had been . fortunate enough to come through alive , there would have been no question of their being transported home after the war . Are they and their families to be penalized still further just because they sacrificed all ? Let those concerned speak for themselves , and let no strong ers begrudge any ray of comfort that can come to the bereaved . My son was . my only child . Mrs. L. SINGER . New York , Feb. 26 , 1946 . Revised Testament Favored To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : On Feb. 18 one of your contributors indicated disapproval of most of the changes made in the interest of " a simple , familiar style " in the recent revised Standard New Testament . Many of us do read the Bible in such versions as the King James because it , contains passages of rare literary beauty and brilliance . Poetic language is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descriptions , but to entertain . Where the purpose of a writing is primarily informative , however , rather than lyrical , the language used should not be archaic but accurate , clear and simple . It is my impression that modern language versions of the Bible have been mach in the belief that the sacred writings are not simply literary documents , but are records of events and insights which are of contemporary importance to the average man . Because of this fact we are willing to sacrifice beauty in the interests of utility . KNOX COLT . New York , Feb. 27 , 1946 . Home Burial for War Dead TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Nothing possibly could have been as full of words that were meaningless as the letter you published on Feb. 17 protesting the plan to bring back the bodies of our war dead . How can the writer and others speak for the mothers , fathers and wives whose dear ones walked out of their lives and met death thousands of miles from home ? Strangers who : can have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons such as " national cemeteries abroad stand as a pledge to Passing of Empire Observed Unrest of Native Populations Regarded as Sign of Definite Move Assemblyman Crisona Applauded ' TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Assemblyman Crisona is to be coin , mended for courage in proposing legislation that may result in a subway fare rise . Until now this has been an issue dodged by the average politician , Another thing in connection with this proposal for which Assemblyman Crisona is further to be commended is his declaration : " The people must choose . * * * Let us have a popular referendum on this issue .

Restaurant Bread Saving TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : There might be considerable saving of wheat if all persons eating out took no more bread than they expected to consume at the meal . This little bit of thoughtfulness might save the health of some of our brothers abroad . DUDLEY B. MARTIN . Leonia , N. J. , Feb. 27 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
